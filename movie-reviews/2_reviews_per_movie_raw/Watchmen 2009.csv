","For over 25 years now, I have cited Blade Runner as my favorite movie of all time. After seeing Watchmen, I may have to reconsider.<br/><br/>First, I'm glad I went to see the movie alone. I've heard so many comments focused on a blue dick, or the length of the movie, or some other such nonsense, that I'm sure watching it with someone would have been a constant barrage of commentary and complaint. And no, that's not Javier Bardem. <br/><br/>Yes, the movie is long; nearly three hours. But, unlike the dreadfully insipid Titanic, at the end of this movie I wasn't asking for those three hours of my life back. And, as with all such movies, you must be able to look beyond the literal.<br/><br/>Watchmen is iconic and iconoclastic, deconstructionist and revisionist, laden with allegory and allusion. Consider, for example, the character Ozymandias. I'm wondering how many people who viewed the film ever even heard of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem by the same name. The character even quotes the poem on a plinth in his Antarctic lair. The allusion is amazing. Here's the full quote;<br/><br/>And on the pedestal these words appear -- ""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"" Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.'<br/><br/>Clearly one must see the allusion to the work, in this case, of a superhero who hopes to leave mankind a lasting legacy, but realizes in the back of his mind that everything is eventually lost in time. Ozymandias was the first poem I ever examined from an expositional point of view, and I was blown away. The use of it in this movie is equally impactful.<br/><br/>Then there is Dr. Manhattan, named, of course, for the Manhattan Project, which yielded the atomic bomb. His character is an allegory for God, and his relationship with man mirrors the apparent detachment with which God sees suffering in the world He created. The deity reference is reinforced often, and one thinks of Oppenheimer's citation of the Bhagavad-Gita, in which Vishnu takes on a godly form and says, ""Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""<br/><br/>In an expository scene in the second act, Dr. Manhattan has a sort of recollection of his life. His account is dizzyingly elliptical, since he does not see time as linear the way others do. This scene has the lyrical feel of my favorite piece of fiction, Alan Lightman's almost unbearably beautiful Einstein's Dreams, and the reference to Einstein cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>But the real beauty of Watchmen is the moral diversity of its superheroes. Each is flawed in different ways, allowing us to inhabit different ethical perspectives, intellectually at least, and witness their consequences. Everything from Rorshach's refusal to compromise, which makes him a doomed fugitive, to the ultimate compromise envisioned by Ozymandias, who can dispassionately evaluate scenarios where millions of lives are sacrificed, calls into question our most cherished beliefs. Where does it leave you? Well, that's for you to decide.<br/><br/>From a purely entertainment perspective, Watchmen is stunning. The visuals are state of the art, and do not suffer from the sort of mental rejection I have for some movies that present too many special effects to swallow at once as reality. And Watchmen doesn't suffer from Hollywood's apparent fascination with camp in comic book movies. Camp works to some degree in Spiderman, since he's a somewhat humorous character to begin with. But the excess of camp rendered the Fantastic Four sequel unwatchable. Watchman proves that superheroes can use more subtle forms of humor, such as irony, without devolving into camp for cheap laughs.<br/><br/>And the music, oh, the music. If you didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's, you will surely miss some of the impact, but don't worry. Even a second hand recollection of such iconic tunes will suffice. I am reminded of the painfully awful Across the Universe, which couldn't even pull together a decent movie built around the greatest catalog in modern music. Watchmen does it in spades.<br/><br/>I LOL'd, I cried. The people in the theatre applauded at the end. I vowed to wait 24 hours before writing a review to see if my euphoria passed. It hasn't."

","Screened FRebruary 23 for Australian Media.<br/><br/>There's no reason for me to expect I was going to like Watchmen. I knew the cast was interesting - Patrick Wilson has made smart film choices that don't rely on or intentionally subvert his good looks (Hard Candy, Little Children); Jackie Earle Haley was icky in Little Children (and I'm old enough to remember him from Breaking Away); Malin Akerman is cute but 28 Dresses and The Heartbreak Kid do not a superhero make; Jeffery Dean Morgan, Matthew Goode - ??? And director Zack Snyder did cool things with zombies in Dawn Of The Dead and made a wild and wacky movie in 300, which totally indicated his third film was probably going to be worth a look, but...you know, whatever...<br/><br/>So they all signed up for Watchmen - based on a comic bo...sorry, graphic novel...that I'd never read and that was coming to theatres less than a year after Ironman and The Dark Knight had redefined how good superhero movies could (and should, from here on in) aspire to be.<br/><br/>That Watchmen has turned out to be the most complex, exhilarating and deeply-moving fantasy film since Terry Gilliam's Brazil surprises nobody on Earth more than me - and, man, did it surprise.<br/><br/>In equal measure, it is a) an inspired vision of an alternate world that echoes but redefines our own existence; b) a subversive yet bracingly humanistic exploration of the role of the superhero in modern literature, c) a supremely adult take on the fetishistic pull of the heightened existence that life as a saviour of society creates, and d) a wildly exciting adventure story that turns normal people into exaggerated victims of their own creation and then back into mere humans.<br/><br/>An exploration of the plot would reveal more vast themes, but at this early stage of its release I don't want to risk lessening the experience for anyone.<br/><br/>I can reveal this - Billy Crudup as Dr Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach create characters every bit as captivating (and deserving of Oscar recognition) as Heath Ledger's Joker; Malin Akerman makes an entrance to the world of superhero timelessness that will be the fantasy of every teenage boy, aged 15 to 50; and from the flawless art direction, set design and special effects to a mesmerising soundtrack, Watchmen is a film that revels in the perfection of minor details.<br/><br/>Be warned - those expecting Spiderman-like teen-angst or Fantastic Four-like silliness will be stunned, perhaps not quite sure of what they have found. Watchmen is an extraordinarily mature, risky project for Hollywood to role the dice on, especially given similarly-complex explorations of social collapse and vigilantism (V For Vendetta, most specifically) have failed to do blockbuster numbers.<br/><br/>But Watchmen is something special and deserving of analysis and discussion. As bold an attempt at commercial film-making as I can remember, Watchmen is an undeniably unique movie experience - rich, perverse, violent and resonant."

","Before anyone sees this film, Zach Snyder should be given a pat on the back. He did what a dozen directors struggled to do for twenty years: he made a Watchmen movie. It seems unthinkable that anyone could properly put the greatest graphic novel of all time on the screen. But Snyder has done pretty much that.<br/><br/>While it is not Alan Moore's Watchmen, it is the closest thing that anyone else could have put on the screen. Snyder approached the material with enough reverence that fans of the comic will appreciate the film. As Snyder has openly declared, the final act does include significant changes, but the alterations that take place fit better on the big screen than the original ending would have. It works because it cuts down on a lot of the necessary back story which Snyder could not include.<br/><br/>Even though many pages of the book were not included, Snyder did take the time to try and preserve other information by including short ""historical"" sequences in the fantastic opening title sequence. By this point, viewers will also have had a chance to appreciate the stellar, and time appropriate, soundtrack. Unlike the hard rock recordings the Snyder chose for the background of 300, Watchmen's background fits the tone and mood of most of the scenes. The only questionable choice was the selection of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" not because of the recording, but rather its awkward placement. Some may also question Snyder's inclusion of gore not present in the book. While the comic does include it's share of violence, Snyder did overtly change several scenes to be more violent. These changes, while flashy on film, may disturb squeamish moviegoers. However, changes aside, Snyder has captured the essence of the book and packaged it in a beautiful 2 hour and 40 minute delight. Overall, it is a satisfying film experience for someone familiar with the source material.<br/><br/>But this might be a different experience for anyone who does not know the book. There is a lot to digest, and the overwhelming visuals may distract some moviegoers from the bigger picture. The interaction of these unique characters remains an integral point to understanding this film, and when the book was pared down for the movie, the relationships of the masked adventures became a bit more forced. The best part of the comic was the glimpse of what is ""beneath the hood,"" and we have less of that in Snyder's adaptation. Additionally, the ending, while simplified, is still a bit convoluted.<br/><br/>Fans and those previously unfamiliar with Watchmen should go in with an open mind. Snyder has performed what Doctor Manhattan might deem a miracle, so it may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate this unique adaptation."
"stewiefan201","10","313","422","14 March 2009"," Watchmen is a fascinating graphic novel adaptation that deserves to be seen by anybody that likes their movies complex, dark, and absorbing.
","Watchmen is the long-awaited graphic novel adaptation that has for a long time been deemed un-filmable. There have been many different points over the years where this movie was supposed to be made, which always ended up not happening. But now Watchmen is finally here in all its glory, and it's probably the best adaptation possible of this complex graphic novel. The story takes place in an alternative 1985, with Nixon beginning his third term as president, and the streets of New York are gritty, dark, and violent. Within New York lives a group of costumed heroes that used to be loved by society, but are now hated by practically everybody. One night a depressed retired hero named The Comedian is murdered by a masked person that breaks into his apartment. Another hero named Rorschach, who wears a mask with shifting ink blots, believes that someone is picking off costumed heroes to begin their own agenda of destruction. Rorschach begins investigating and hunting down the person that is responsible for The Comedian's death. Meanwhile we meet another hero who glows blue, and has almost literally become a God. His name is Dr. Manhattan, and although he has the power to save the world he won't do it because he has lost many of his human emotions. The other main costumed heroes are Night Owl and Silk Spectre, who begin to fall in love amid the chaos of their secret lives. Any other attempt to describe the complex plot of this movie would be nearly impossible.<br/><br/>Watchmen was an extremely complex graphic novel filled with a lot of flawed costumed characters, strong plot, powerful sense of style, and also contained a world that seems a little too close to our own. The movie carries every one of these elements in the best way it possibly could. It stays true to the novel, and only changes a few details. The memorable characters are very well portrayed and acted as well. Dr. Manhattan (the giant blue guy) is played very well by Billy Crudup, who manages to keep the character interesting despite his emotionless attitude. Malin Akerman (Silk Spectre II), Patrick Wilson (Night Owl II), and Matthew Goode (Adrian Veidt) are also very good in their roles. However the two actors that truly help add depth and a real sense of anger to the film are Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Rorschach was probably my favorite character because technically he's not really a hero at all. He's a psychopath with harmful and destructive behavior, even though in a way he's trying to do what he believes is right for the world. He is a fascinating character with his shape-shifting mask full of ink blots that mirror his personality.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1985 and mimics what was happening back then. Watchmen's story revolves around the threat of nuclear war and global destruction, and the characters mostly try to do the right thing for the world but have trouble seeing the point in doing so. This is a great film that stays true to the original graphic novel while transitioning its style, characters, chain of events, and storyline from page-to-screen the best it possibly could. However if you're not familiar with the source material you may find yourself confused by this movie. It's not like The Dark Knight where everybody that goes to see it knows who Batman and the Joker are. These characters are not as famous as those types of household name characters, and may be hard for someone's whose never read the novel to understand. Personally I only read a few chapters before I saw the movie, and I thought the movie was incredible. I always give a movie props for not taking the easy way out by spoon-feeding everything to the audience. The book, as well as the movie, was daring by taking of the risk of being complex and making you think for a change. Watchmen is a great movie, and despite its long running time of 163 minutes, I never found it boring at all. Watchmen is a fascinating graphic novel adaptation that deserves to be seen by anybody that likes their movies complex, dark, and absorbing."
"wtxx","10","502","701","10 March 2009"," Best movie I've seen in a long time
","Firstly, I have not read the graphic novel. This was deliberate, since I knew there was going to be a movie, and reading any book tends to ruin the movie. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of things in the graphic novel that they left out or changed, and it's hard for those who have read it to imagine how people could understand the subtleties of the story without it. But trust me, the morally complex, multi-layered characters and plot were very well delivered by the movie alone. There was nothing that seemed like it didn't make sense or wasn't quite explained. The movie was just about perfect.<br/><br/>I'm surprised to hear a lot of reviews saying that this is just an action movie for teenage boys; I thought quite the opposite. There was much less action than I expected, the movie centered mostly on emotions and ideas conveyed through dialog, narration and character flashbacks. The action scenes were all fairly short, though when there was action it was delightfully innovative. There were a lot of nasty and unexpected twists like limbs snapping, guts sticking to the ceiling, bones audibly crunching... Every time something violent happened, they made it interesting and shocking rather than recreating the generic ho-hum violence of every other movie. (And there was no obligatory 30-minute-long final action scene culminating in the conclusion of the plot... oh joy! Those get so boring.) Plus, many of the scenes were rather bold for a mainstream film, and showed certain things that are normally hidden off-screen or completely avoided. The only example I feel I can give without spoiling anything is the full frontal male nudity, something that is rather conspicuously hidden in almost every Hollywood movie. This movie isn't concerned about hiding little things like that, just as it isn't concerned about hiding certain subjects that most movies wouldn't show.<br/><br/>This movie definitely isn't for everyone. People expecting another Dark Knight will be disappointed (or, as in my case, thrilled), as this movie is completely unique. People who want an action movie and don't want all that talking and thinking will be disappointed. But to those looking for a long, complicated, deeply moving epic that will really make them think about the very concepts of right, wrong, and heroism (and who haven't read the book, which based on other reviews seems to ruin it): Do NOT miss this movie!"

","Christopher Nolan was right. This movie indeed came out too early.<br/><br/>This movie not only shows us the pictures. But also the people behind them.
What I love about Watchmen is that it's mature and basic study of how our society is structured. There's so many quotes that can be used in todays world. And with Zack Snyders visuals. It really blends well.<br/><br/>I gotta say. People calling this movie ""boring"" are the ones watching 4 movies a year. And they're all action heavy blockbusters."
"c7flat13","9","47","61","25 February 2019"," A classic.
","One of the deepest most sophisticated nuanced super hero movies ever. Production quality is amazing. The story is complex and long but worth the payoff. The acting is great overall. The hero's are vulnerable in so many ways. For every ability they have they suffer from even worse flaws. This is an alternate universe that forks from historical events. Rorschach is my favorite anti hero of all time and the end for me is an emotional powerful climax thats always a gut punch. Soundtrack is spot on. Should have won an Oscar or at least a nomination for any number of categories imo. Genre changing idea as profound and well crafted as the first matrix by comparison. Wouldn't be surprised if the MCU borrowed many ideas from this epic. I have no history with this franchise as a graphic novel and can only judge as a fan of the movie."
"ftyl","7","774","1167","26 February 2009"," We All Watch the Watchmen
","Let's get this out of the way - Watchmen the movie is not as good as the graphic novel. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder's Watchmen is not your average graphic novel adaptation. Unlike with 300, which was short and sharp and shallow and easy to adapt, the original Watchmen is incredibly dense and, as written, unfilmable. So Snyder did something very smart - he didn't even try. What he did instead was to take the world of Watchmen and rebuild it in a way which made a virtue of this new medium (film) rather than try to cram the graphic novel into a cinematic form.<br/><br/>Nowhere is this approach more obvious than in the film's title sequence. A wonderfully composed collage of images depicts scenes from the universe of Watchmen in a way which is only possible in the movies. In this way, we are subconsciously introduced to a world where costumed heroes are a part of everyday culture and brought, in a stylish and fluid way, from the original days of the Minutemen to those of the Watchmen. This introduction is cinematically perfect and is indicative of the heights which the Watchmen movie is perfectly capable of achieving but not quite capable of sustaining.<br/><br/>Watchen is a brave film for a major studio to make and without a doubt it would not exist in its present form without the success of 300. It is incredibly dark (both in tone as well as shooting style) with events that would be anathema to any other superhero story. The less you know about the story, the better so there will be no spoilers here but suffice to say Watchmen's version of a happy ending is a far cry from the Hollywood norm.<br/><br/>Snyders brings his unique approach to action to bear on Watchmen, expanding on the action scenes in the comic without making it feel too redundant. His efforts are ably supported by the incredibly game cast, excellent cinematography and near perfect visual effects - this film is incredible to look at but also manages to create an entire world in a way which most superhero stories never do. The attention to detail in even the smallest scenes is commendable and the dense flashback structure means the same attention is paid to the presentation of full and complex characters.<br/><br/>Snyder has made a film which is gorgeous to look at, agreeably violent, well written, wonderfully designed and features some of the best small scale action sequences ever committed to celluloid. But, naturally, not everything is perfect. Most of the performances are excellent, with a cast of relative unknowns who manage to distinguish themselves despite constantly competing with overbearing effects and design. Patrick Wilson, in particular, does great work with a difficult role as Nite Owl, while Jackie Earle Hayley is blistering as Rorschach. Unfortunately in a film which could have done with a strong female presence, neither Carla Gugino nor Malin Ackerman make much of an impression, despite having quite a lot of screen time. Synder's musical cues are another bone of contention - often pushing the tone of the film into the realm of parody. And the ending... well let's just say it cheapens the experience in search of the lowest common denominator and the whole package suffers. On a related note, neither of the stories major revelations are handled that well. These moments were genuinely shocking in the graphic novel but are almost glossed over in the film.<br/><br/>Don't get the wrong impression, Watchmen is a good film, sometimes a great film. Snyder has managed to make a movie which is a terrifically well balanced compromise between accessibility and fidelity. That anyone can sit down in the cinema and experience a distillation of the Watchmen universe in just 163 minutes is a marvel. It does not deliver the depth of feeling and connection of the novel but that is more a matter of the differences in the media than a failure on the part of the film.<br/><br/>On its own merits, Zack Synder's Watchmen is a dark and twisted tale peopled with complex characters whose motivations are not obvious even to themselves. It is a solid film, sometimes rising into the extraordinary, and deserves to be successful. This is not Alan Moore's Watchmen but it is a competent extension of the universe into another medium and a worthy cinema-going experience."
"jeehde2","9","660","1013","25 February 2009"," I'll be watching the Watchmen. Over and over again.
","After months of anticipation, today I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the premiere of Watchmen over here. Together with a friend, who hasn't read the book, we went to Amsterdam this afternoon. Expectations were ridiculously high and I was kinda afraid to leave disappointed, since I wasn't sure how to possibly film the book that people refer to as not filmable. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder appears to have been the right choice to take the job. 300 proved that he has an eye for visuals and knows how to adept a book as faithful to its source as possible, but faithfulness and nice pictures don't necessarily make for a good movie. In order to achieve this he was forced to cut several sub-plots and trim sequences now and then. He made some very smart moves here though, by making up with detail. Every single frame will please fans with in-jokes, or hints at related characters or plots that the unfamiliar moviegoer won't miss. This gives Watchmen the very much needed depth and heart that fans so very much craved for. <br/><br/>The overall story is an exact replica from the book, with every single flashback in place and only 1 noticeable change towards the ending. Much discussed by fans, but I'm sure that only the very worst nitpickers or haters might think badly of this. It works perfectly well, so rest assured, it won't disappoint. The movie begins, like the novel, with the Comedian being killed in a long, tense and action-packed scene that sets the proper mood and makes one long for more, which we get plenty of the next 160 minutes. After this scene comes the brilliant intro montage (with 'The Times They Are A-Changin' in the background), which introduces the Minutemen and helps newcomers to pick up on the story. <br/><br/>Everything that comes after this is in one word overwhelming. Every character is well cast, takes complete hold of your attention and gets the time for a proper and detailed introduction. After watching it, it's hard to tell which hero I liked best. Patrick Wilson is perfect as Dan Dreiberg, Rorschach a joy to watch and you're watching Dr. Manhatting in awe, which makes sense for his character. Also, I'm sure everyone will secretly fall in love with Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman). The suits have been beautifully changed wherever necessary and also have the right effect. The Minutemen look kinda stupid, which is perfect for the superhero parody element of the book. But not only the heroes impress, the fans will have a splendid time recognizing all the smaller characters, such as the news-vendor and the reading kid, or the shrink with his pills. <br/><br/>Although Snyder adapted the book from scene to scene, there are not only passages he had to make shorter, but also those he slightly enhanced. Fights are longer; action sequences leave a bigger impression. He wonderfully uses slow motion effects and fortunately kept the editing at a modest tempo, never resulting in unwatchable quick fights. I heard that the UK rated this 18+, which makes sense given the amount of violence it has. Be it boiling fat thrown over a man or bones broken in the most horrible ways, there's plenty of gore. But the movie also doesn't fall short in nudity. Apart from a short scene involving Malin Akerman, it's Billy Crudup who gets to run around naked showing his digital penis the whole time as Dr. Manhattan. It doesn't distract however, but gives Watchmen something truly adult, very different from the far more gentle 'Knight'. <br/><br/>The special effects are really good, Dr. Manhattan looks awesome, Mars looks like you expect Mars to look and Rorschach's mask remains fun to see from start to finish. Most of the visuals and environments are very colorful and almost drown in atmosphere, a very welcome change from the realism that 'Knight' had. This is simply more fun to watch and impresses a whole lot more. The soundtrack is fun, picking various songs from that period. I'm sure most wouldn't work as well in other movies, but they seem perfectly in place here. <br/><br/>Watchmen is without any doubt the film I was so very much hoping for. A perfect adaptation of the novel is impossible, but this is the closest Snyder could've possibly gotten. His eye for detail will please fans, the visuals are wonderful, the characters intrigue and fortunately he hasn't made any wrong choices concerning the story. The 160 minutes flew by and I can't wait to see this for a second time next week. An astonishing movie that impresses in every way possible. I had a wonderful time. <br/><br/>I won't hold back here by giving this 9.5/10. By the way, my friend who didn't know the book loved it as much as I did."
"toqtaqiya2","7","159","238","18 August 2010"," The greatest superhero story ever told.
","Watchmen turned out to be an engrossing film, one definitely worth seeing. I have to say, I wasn't enthusiastic about watching it at first. It's based on the great graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's widely considered to be the best graphic novel ever. Films adapted form great literary works usually don't turn out well. The film also didn't have a big budget. More money was thrown at making Iron Man (2008) and The Dark Knight (2008), for example. This doesn't matter though because Watchmen surpasses all comic book films in terms of professionalism. Zack Snyder is a good action director. Just watch 300 (2007) for proof. With Watchmen he demonstrated that he is just a good director overall. He works well with actors. The acting in the film is almost universally excellent. Everyone gets to shine. Even Malin Akerman had her moments. Not one character feels like a throwaway. All this is further complimented by the good choices in costumes. No one can deny that the heroes in Watchmen look cool. The CGI is excellent too. Be it Doctor Manhattan or Nite Owl's airship, everything looks just right. Snyder staged some truly impressive dramatic scenes. The use of music is inspired. The score by Tyler Bates is obviously fitting, but the choices in songs may surprise some people. I, however, think that the songs are just right. It was good to hear Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are a-Changing"" at the beginning and Leonard Cohen's ""First We Take Manhattan"" at the end. What made me like the film even more is its cinematography by Larry Fong. The look of each decade was captured perfectly. The 1980s are somewhat dark in the film's alternate reality though. Nuclear war seems close, and society is sick. To all this is added the sweet look that's also present in the graphic novel. There are many images in Watchmen that are memorable, even unforgettable. There are so many interesting details that I couldn't wait to watch the film more than once to pick up what I missed on first viewing. Thankfully, Snyder didn't change the politics and observations of the graphic novel for the film. Some parts are missing but the endeavour is still a thought-provoking two-and-a-half hours. Plus, it has a clear narrative. This is a comic book film for mature audiences. It stands above other comic book films because it's smart and because it tackles some of the most important issues, even mankind's existence. Watchmen was expertly made, there is a lot to like about it. I respect it and I like it more than any other superhero motion picture. It gets a high recommendation from me."
"grzgru","10","65","95","4 December 2009"," It is not too late. Never has been, never will be too late.
","A short warning first. You may like action-packed toy/game inspired or superhero movies, like Transformers or X-Man, where the action has priority over message - or there is no message at all. Do not be alarmed if it is true, there is nothing wrong with you. It simply indicates most probably you will not enjoy Watchmen. Stop reading and look somewhere else. Otherwise, please continue.<br/><br/>I begun to learn English reading comics, Superman, Spiderman, Batman, X-Men and FF later. But that was more than 40 years ago, when I was young. Therefore, I had never heard about Watchman phenomenon, until I bought a DVD with the theatrical version. Then it begun. I saw the complete movie several times day after day. I became obsessed by its characters and themes. I put away my work for a few days, doing research on the Internet. I found out the movie is controversial for many. Not for me. It is a true masterpiece of a rare kind, something much more than a sum of all its ingredients. All parts fit together, while every part makes others stronger.<br/><br/>The story is fascinating, the characters are psychologically rich, complex and morally ambiguous. If you look deeper, you find lots of disturbing and sometimes unanswered questions about politics, people and societies. Some of those questions flow from the movie's motto. Who watched President Bush when he launched the Iraqi war, to finish the job his father did not ? Who watched Israeli Cabinet, when it launched the Gaza Offensive to improve its poll ratings ahead of elections ? Who watches Iranian Ayatollahs and their dreams to create a new Persian Empire, no matter what ? <br/><br/>Equally intriguing are questions about the human nature. Are dictators, who sacrifice millions so easily, driven by their lust for power or by a dream of ideal societies envisioned for their nations ? Do they truly believe in their utopias ? What is really behind brutality and trigger-happiness of some of the law enforcement officials ? Do they loose control or enjoy their work too much ? Why some people prefer death to avoid betrayal of their values ? Am I ready to do that ? These are some of the questions I ask myself, but there are much more from different perspectives. This movie makes you think hard about the world around.<br/><br/>Acting is from satisfactory to very good. The best actor is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Should get Oscar Nomination. However, I found Jeffrey Dean Morgan, The Comedian, as the most charismatic. He steals every scene he is in. As for the music, the original motion picture score is good, but it is the incidental music I applaud. The opening sequence, the funeral and Dr. Manhattan's Mars monologue are the most powerful scenes in the movie and the music is responsible for such impact. Bob Dylan is a songwriting genius and The Times They Are A-Changin' is a perfect background. The Sound of Silence illustrates introductory funeral images in an unforgettable way. As for Dr. Manhattan's Mars monologue, music written by Philip Glass is a brilliant choice - particularly as the laboratory where he gains his superpowers is run by Professor Glass. And then comes All Along The Watchtower, one of my all-time favorites. I will recall the related movie scene every time I hear it till I die.<br/><br/>Some question the 99 Luftballons as the right choice, but not me. The decision to use it converted the accompanied scene into a small jewel. I raised the eyebrow only once, when I heard Hallelujah. After the second Watchman watch it dropped down however.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I ordered the novel immediately after my first Watchmen watch. I just completed my first reading and it is certainly not the last one. I had never read a graphic novel before and I am happy it was the first one. Now, it is the interaction between Watchmen The Novel and The Movie which makes my amazement and impression so deep and lasting. Watchmen The Novel fills some of the gaps and provides more context for many scenes. Watchmen The Movie enriches the pictures and texts. For me, both are perfectly complementary.<br/><br/>It seems most of the critics sided with Alan Moore, who stated Watchmen The Novel cannot be translated into a movie. That is the writer's right. But if a movie critic does not judge the movie as such, but how well - or not well - the book was adopted, then he or she should take care of the books. Movies should be judged on their own and Watchmen is a true masterpiece as a standalone work. But even if the book is taken into account, the adaptation is at least very good in my view. The changes, omissions and additions make sense because of the time frame and other factors, Zack Snyder's style included. I understand some of the fans of the book were disappointed by simplifications and the end in particular. Let us be serious, shall we ? Watchmen story takes place on an alternate Earth, right ? Think of The Movie and The Novel as parallel worlds that overlap mostly and differ in some respects. Such worlds can happily coexist together, as an extension of the original Watchman concept. If we accept imaginary worlds, why there should be only one ?<br/><br/>The movie has some tiny flaws, but they disappear without a trace when you look at the whole. Watchman The Movie would not be so great without Watchman The Novel. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons created a masterpiece in a graphical form. Zack Snyder turned it into a movie masterpiece. If you are still with me, see Watchmen The Movie and you should enjoy it as I did, do and will. It is not too late. Never has been, never will be too late for that."

","I have a serious problem with this film. I have seen it a half-dozen times, taken it apart, put it back together, tried to find something wrong with it and I cannot. I am coming to the reluctant conclusion it may be one of the greatest films ever made, likely a top-10, right up there with Citizen Kane, Alien, Godfather, you know the drill. The story is dazzling, action-packed, politically aware, and brilliant. As good or better than Sin City. The actors, many of whom (sigh) I am not familiar with are brilliant. Jackie Earle Haley practically picks the film up bodily and carries it. The direction is not merely good it is perfect. Even the sound track seems to move the story along. (And I am no fan of Zack Synder outside of this film. MAN OF STEEL was a sellout to the ""action"" crowd, creating chaos out of order. Ditto Sucker Punch). But art is like that. Sometimes it surprises you. Many critics have said that Social Network is the new Citizen Kane. But they confabulate. This film could actually be."

","An ex-superhero is thrown through a plate glass window, many stories above the city. Was his murder somehow connected to the feared imminent nuclear holocaust between the United States and Russia? Someone seems to want the former do-gooders out of the way in this thrilling, one-of-a-kind, jaded look at superheroes that turns conventional comic-book wisdom on its head.<br/><br/>It's an alternate 1985. Richard Nixon has been elected to a fifth presidential term. But the USSR is encroaching on Afghanistan, and the US isn't taking too kindly to it. Enter the smartest man in the world, Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), formerly known as superhero Ozymandias, who is working with the ethereal Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a physicist who has achieved immortality and near-omniscience owing to a long-ago lab mishap. With Dr. Manhattan's help, Adrian hopes to dissolve the tension between the two superpowers.<br/><br/>But that's not the only conflict, not by a long shot. Since the characters here are unfamiliar to most audiences, there's plenty of backstory, seamlessly edited into the main story as important details that inform the characters. (For one thing, we get to see the rather graphic - more on that later - origin of Dr. Manhattan.) The superheroes have conflict within their own group, which has gone its separate ways - with different goals and outlooks. Not only that, but the world at large isn't entirely on the side of masked avengers, labeling them as vigilantes. By the present, most of them have ditched their costumes for traditional lives; some tinker with their gadgets in their basements, in hiding, and some merely blend into society.<br/><br/>Here's who's left in 1985, in addition to Ozymandias (who's revealed his true identity to the world) and Dr. Manhattan: Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Others have gone insane or been murdered themselves in years past; all suffer as everyday humans now.<br/><br/>So how does Watchmen skewer comic-book tropes? Well, they're not always good, you see. Some are, but some maliciously kill, albeit for the greater good. Some take delight in the suffering of man if that man is, say, a child killer. That sort of thing. The truth is, no one here is perfect, not even the superheroes. Another difference is the high level of violence in the movie. This isn't a comic-book movie where the bad guys fall down when they get slapped, no sir. No, the heroes beat the stuffing out of them, with blood, entrails, and the like splattering all over the place. Limbs are dislodged, brains are exposed. It's wildly violent, much like director Zack Snyder's last film, 300, but without the detached, this-can't-be-real tone. This isn't a movie in which the bad guys are brought in for questioning or sent to prison to think about what they've done. This is a movie in which the bad guys are annihilated, period.<br/><br/>In case you're still contemplating taking the kiddies to see this superhero fare, here's another caveat: there's nudity. No, it's not Malin Akerman (although you do get a glimpse), it's the blue-hued Dr. Manhattan himself. Sometimes he's in a thong, but often he's just letting it all dangle there. Funny thing is, it's not really all that shocking. If it'd been one of the humans, perhaps, but Dr. Manhattan is more humanoid than human at this point.<br/><br/>At 160 minutes, the action really doesn't let up. But that's nothing - most movies are fast paced now. This one has a plot that can keep up with the action. In fact, the intricacies of the plot are delicious to unwrap; this was not a movie - superhero or not - where you can predict the end without just taking a wild stab.<br/><br/>I can't understate how tremendous an achievement this movie is. If we're all lucky, this will open the door for more adult comic-book films. The good guys don't always have to be about justice and truth and all that junk, and the bad guys can sometimes get what's really coming to them. I do want to point out that among the outstanding cast, Jackie Earle Haley as the haunted, masked Rorschach is tremendous. Wilson, who appeared with Haley in Little Children a few years back, is also dweebishly strong as the aging Nite Owl II."

","""No. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise.""-Rorschach While Rorschach's (Jackie Earle Haley) proclamation may be possible to uphold as a superhero, the refusal to compromise on behalf of the filmmaker in the process of literary adaptation is impossible. As film theorist André Bazin wrote, ""Faithfulness to form, literary or otherwise, is illusory: what matters is the equivalence in meaning of the forms."" In other words, Bazin is arguing that each medium has its own modes of representation, thus the struggle for formal fidelity is a lost cause and that the main objective is that the adaptation should capture the original work's essence. Bazin continues, stating, ""All it takes is for the filmmakers to have enough visual imagination to create the cinematic equivalent of the style of the original."" Zach Snyder's (""300"") attempt to adapt Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's ""Watchmen"" (1986-1987) is compromised but that is the only possible way an adaptation can work as a film. He captures the Bazinian essence of Moore and Gibbon's work, a deconstruction of the superhero mythos, with an aesthetic that also captures much of the style of the original graphic novel (to the degree it is possible in film). Will die-hard fans be disappointed? No doubt, but quite unjustly. Even with Snyder's compromised ending, which ultimately can be interpreted as being more devastating than the climax concocted by Moore and Gibbons (although the film lacks a sequence on par with the opening pages of the comic's twelfth volume), Snyder's ambitious attempt is the best that could be done in a feature film.<br/><br/>For those of you unfamiliar with the story, ""Watchmen"" takes place on an alternate timeline beginning in late 1985. The United States won the war in Vietnam, Richard Nixon has been elected to third presidential term, and the only man standing between nuclear war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. is ""Dr. Manhattan"" (Billy Crudup), a human nuclear bomb who stands on the American side as a nuclear deterrent. The film, like the comic, begins with the murder of Eddie Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a retired superhero formally known as ""The Comedian."" While clues point to robbery, the sociopathic Rorschach believes that the death of ""The Comedian"" could be the beginning of plot to eliminate former costumed heroes. Hoping to foil such a conspiracy, Rorschach warns his former partners in crime fighting: Manhattan and his lover, the beautiful Silk Specter (Malin Ackerman), the Batman-esquire Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), and the smartest man in the world, Ozymandias (Matthew Goode). Collectively dubbed the Watchmen, the group initially disregards Rorschach's theory. That is until Dr. Manhattan is forced off Earth, making the possibility of nuclear war a near certainty.<br/><br/>This complex story, as readers familiar with the book will attest, is existential that the typical comic book and the film is much the same. Much like last summer's ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Watchmen"" is not concerned with action scenes and obligatory fights. As the film's antagonist notes in the film's climax, ""I'm not a comic book villain,"" and, like the film, he is not treated as being the product of a fantastic world far outside our own. While Snyder does bring an unrealistic edge to the action sequences (particularly his manipulation of time via cuts and slow motion), these techniques, much like those of Sam Peckinpah, become a means of deconstructing motion...just like a comic book. Instead, ""Watchmen"" as both a graphic novel and a film favors the approach of making comic book and superhero fans think about the motives and actions in what becomes a study of ethics. In this study, it is only the murderous and sociopathic Rorschach who is able of following any sort of moral code...even if it is demented in its adherence to rejecting compromise.<br/><br/>For the most part, Snyder's direction is precise. His graphical style captures Gibbon's graphics and layout perfect...right down to the book's fearful symmetry. The framing and camera movements mirror those of the book, a treat for avid fans of the book and Gibbon's art. Moreover, Snyder's work with the actors is quite accomplished. Jackie Earle Haley continues his streak of embodying sociopaths perfectly. Patrick Wilson captures the sadness and longing for a greater goal in life, something all retired heroes must face.<br/><br/>The film is not without its flaws. For the most part, the film and Snyder do a fantastic job of drawing out the background of the individual characters and the past of masked heroes in general very well (particularly during the film's opening ten minutes and the beautifully executed credit sequence). However, the one character who seems to receive the short end of the narrative-stick is Nite Owl. Snyder establishes his background, but not to the degree that the others benefit from. In addition, Malin Ackerman's performance, while being far from bad, seemed to be the weakest out of the leads. However, her character is the most clichéd in the book, so perhaps Ackerman just did not have that much to work with.<br/><br/>The most glaring flaw in the film, however, is in Snyder's choice of end credit music. The film, like the book, ends on a relatively quiet scene but it is entirely displaced by a terrible cover of Bob Dylan's ""Desolation Row"" by My Chemical Romance. While Dylan's version would have been fine and in keeping with the period music used (listen for a Musak cover of ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" in Ozymandia's office) throughout the rest of the film, the cover is loud and obnoxious and seems like it was fitted for an entirely different film than the one just watched. <br/><br/>Snyder has made an adaptation that is as faithful and accessible as possible, a compromise that is ultimately successful. Snyder, to borrow from Bazin's model, not only captures the essence of Moore and Gibbon's novel but also demonstrates a ""visual imagination"" that creates the impression of Gibbon's layout and graphical style."

","It is 1985, Richard Nixon is serving his fifth term as US president and the world stands on the brink of destruction as the world's two superpowers vie for nuclear supremacy. The only thing stopping the USSR from launching a doomsday attack is America's Dr Manhattan  a being with enough power to destroy planets and much else besides.<br/><br/>Wow! I was lucky enough to watch this at a preview screening in London last night and came to the film with little knowledge about what to expect. Having seen the posters around the place and perhaps catching one or two of the trailers I was expecting something akin to another ""X-Men"" movie (which frankly I've never found particularly interesting). However, it was a very pleasant surprise to find that Zack Snyder has served up something entirely fresh and quite dazzling. Watchmen takes the well-worn superhero format and turns it on its head. As you would expect from a movie of this genre you get a tale of attempted world domination by evil baddies, good guys wearing latex costumes, fistfuls of action and spectacular special effects. What you would not expect is to have this interwoven with eye-watering violence (a scene where one particularly nasty bad guy gets a meat cleaver brought down on his forehead being one example), full frontal male nudity (albeit computer generated) and rampant satire. The US political system, military posturing and blind patriotism are all given a bit of a roasting by David Hayter and Alex Tse's script. Add to this a host of compelling performances, notably Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, and you have an exceptional cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Watchmen is no ordinary superhero movie and likely to manage the difficult feat of satisfying both the fan-boys and the uninitiated punters (like myself). Its success means it must be highly likely that there will be a sequel  if not several. Catch this early if you can and be one of the first to witness that rarefied thing in cinema  something beautiful, exciting and original."
"gcj4201987","Null","275","504","1 March 2009"," very good, even if you've read the book.
","I recently saw a free (oh yes) early showing of Watchmen and have to say that it was very good. There have been few movies that I have been this excited for. Some disappointed horribly (Spiderman 3), and some far exceeded my expectations (Dark Knight). This movie falls somewhere in between, leaning closer to exceeded what I thought was going to be a hard book to turn into a movie.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is extremely accurate to the book and very well done. While there are some differences from the book (for example, Dan Dreiberg goes to warn Viedt about the ""masked killer"", not Rorschach) but almost all of them are excusable and didn't effect the flow of the movie or my ability to enjoy it. Even as far as dialog goes, the movie stays true to the book. Towards the middle, some of the differences begin to effect the film. The best example I can think of is how Dr. Manhattan acts during his live interview (I'll restrain from giving away any scenes). Not only did the course of events change from the book (which I can understand, given there must be some sort of time limit for a film), but some of what he says was pretty much copy and pasted from other scenes in the book. Nevertheless, I was able to oversee these differences and enjoy the film.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was the biggest change from the book that I noticed. I think they did this for 2 reasons. 1, I had heard that they were going to include an aspect of energy and where we get it into the film, making it more topical. Secondly, I think the ending of the book would have been too out there for most viewers and would have required a lot more explaining (which the book gives) then would have been feasible for the length of the film (it was about 2 and a half hours long). <br/><br/>I think if you have read the book, you will enjoy the movie. You'll probably spend a lot of time making sure the movie stays true to the book (like I did), but then you'll stop and just enjoy it for being a good movie. I think if you haven't read the book, you might enjoy the movie even more. As most readers know, it is unlike any comic book and actually answers the question, what would the world be like with superheroes? We see even the ones we like have dark sides and the ones we don't have the best intentions. <br/><br/>On a closing note, there are some things I would have changed, had I been to art school and had a gazillion dollar budget for a movie of this magnitude. For one, I think making Dr. Manhattan appear nude, while keeping true to the book, takes away from the movie. I heard a lot of snickers whenever you could see his penis, and I even think they may have showed it more than they do in the book (if you've read the book, take note of the scene were Rorschach comes to visit him and Laurie). I think while it was done with good intentions, covering him up would have been acceptable and not have changed anything about the movie. Also, while I really enjoyed 300 and all the fight scenes in it, the style of slowing down a punch or kick and then speeding it up to real time, I felt, didn't work for this movie and sort of made it seem corny. 300 the book is written like a comic book. Watchmen isn't. The fight scenes, as gritty as they were, still felt like I as watching 300 again. Besides these small points, I thought the movie was awesome and I recommend it to reader and non- reader of Watchmen alike."

","Having read the graphic novel and having a film degree, I understood why many people thought that Watchmen could not be filmed. After seeing a sneak preview this weekend, I now believe anything is filmable in the right hands. While many purists will whine about the changes to the ending, it was an absolutely brilliant way to translate the desired effect from the novel to the big screen. Aside from that, the film does an absolutely incredible job of bringing the novel to life. The acting, fight scenes, directing, and special effects are as good as they come. I would go into more detail but I don't want to spoil anything. Just go watch what may be the best movie of the 21st century so far.<br/><br/>WARNING: Do not bring your kids to this movie! High schoolers may be old enough but anyone younger needs to be left at home. This is definitely a R movie movie intended for adults."

","With 300, Zack Snyder had the problem of having not enough meat on the bone - Frank Miller's violent graphic novel was short and in-your-face, with director Snyder compensating by spending pretty much all of it's two hour runtime in super-slow motion. Here the problem is reversed: Alan Moore's unfilmable, complicated and very, very deep graphic novel seemed simply too dense for any director to take by the horns and be successful. Hell, even Moore himself deemed it so - so much that he disowned the film entirely.<br/><br/>Here, Snyder has two audiences: those familiar, and those who aren't. If you're the latter, Watchmen is a masterwork of literature, telling the story of a group of masked avengers who, since outlawed, live empty and lonely lives. When one is killed in his apartment, Rorschach, who dons the famous ever-moving mask, takes it upon himself to get to the root of the real reason for the death, but stumbles onto something much larger than he could ever have expected.<br/><br/>It really is a character piece. Each one, filled off-screen with complicated, articulate back-stories is brought to life on screen by some of the most heartfelt acting I've seen in a long time (save perhaps Malin Ackerman as the latex-wearing Silk Spectre II), particularly from Billy Crudup who plays the blue, often naked (and well-hung) demi-god who is the only superhero with real superpowers.<br/><br/>Although the star of the show is Rorschach himself. Despite being behind a mask for the large majority of the film, Jackie Earle Haley is beyond perfect for the role. His husky voice commands the voiceovers from Rorschach's journal (recited in many cases word-for-word from the novel), and plays the psychopathic, paranoid and immensely complex role with such a force that you simply can't tear your eyes away from him.<br/><br/>Snyder made himself known with 300 - the ultra-violent story of the Spartans who went to war (and lost miserably). However, Watchmen makes 300 seem like Mary Poppins - this has got to be one of the most violent films I have ever seen. All the book's action sequences are there, just bigger. More badass. Gory as hell. And, for some reason Snyder decided to place a porny, cringy 3 minute sex scene set to Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" slap bang in the middle of the film. Sure, it was in the book, but it was shorter, and the soundtrack was most certainly not this poncy.<br/><br/>However, this discrepancy is the only gripe (and this is a very minor gripe) that I have with the film. It's hard to watch in places - a rape scene here, a pregnant woman killed there - and even pulls the heartstrings in others (Doctor Manhattan's backstory most definitely (almost) brought me to tears). The book is majorly complex, deep and meaningful, and in it's transition to screen, a lot of that is lost in translation. But what we get is a fantastically artistic, fast-paced action epic. Snyder was aiming for two audiences who are polar opposites, and comes free with an adaptation of which even writer Alan Moore should be proud."

"rufi-4","1","257","504","20 March 2009"," When is the good part coming?
","I have never read any comic or graphic novel, yet I have been able to enjoy quite a few movies that were derived from them. This was certainly not the case for Watchmen. Half way through I was left wondering when the good stuff would finally start coming.<br/><br/>Maybe you might have some pre-existing attachment to the characters if you have read the books, but if the movie is all you have, the characters are one-dimensional, dull and unattractive. The Comedian is the only one I loved straight away but he dies within 5 minutes. Rorschach is the next best thing but doesn't get enough focus to really capture my heart. The way he is discarded at the end, made me wonder if really he was of any importance. The strength of his character is too strongly diluted by the bad scenes of the Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II that continuously interrupt the flow. Silk Spectre II was horrible. She seems to have no emotions whatsoever. All she does is have sex with the guys without too much of a pause between them. The fact that the Comedian is her father might have been expected to give her more depth but hardly seems to faze her. Instead the 5 seconds of poorly acted sobbing followed by immediate reconciliation makes it seem like it's no big deal whatsoever. Nite Owl II is a geek devoid of passion and lacking a backbone. He's the kind of classmate who's name you wouldn't remember after 1 year. Dr. Manhattan serves no purpose other than being the eventual deus ex machina that solves everything, making the efforts of all the other heroes look totally stupid and pedestrian. He's disconnected from the world and is typically not the kind of character a viewer would connect with. The bad guy, Ozzy, gets hardly any background or an explanation why he's both smarter than everyone and able to beat up on the Comedian, Nite Owl II, Rorschach and the Silk Spectre II. Or why he can catch speeding bullets... The movie spends a whole lot of time on flashbacks that take out the whole momentum of the plot. Yet, despite all those flashbacks, it does not manage to make me feel connected to any of the characters. This is the main weakness to me.<br/><br/>The songs were nice individually but many times seemed wrong for the scene. It's one of the first times the soundtrack really bothered me in a movie, which says a lot. The CGI was too obvious and in some cases obnoxious and overdone, giving no serious added value. Of course they were breathtaking at times but they were awful at other times. I was looking for a dark movie with corrupted morals and realistic heroes who are not perfect. Only Rorschach brings this to the movie. Slow motion fight scenes, open-bone fractures and blood splattering around just made me sigh. There was no x-factor in any of this. No Sin City effect, no 300 adrenaline pace, no Dark Knight madness, nothing. Part of the reason why so many of the fight scenes couldn't interest me is because they occur in subplots or suddenly pop up in the main plot unexpected.<br/><br/>As a movie, it failed for me. This says nothing about the graphic novel, which I might one day buy to find out what the characters are really about. They sacrificed momentum and continuity in the main plot to narrate partial backgrounds on too many characters. Often times it's hard to connect your audience to 1 or 2 characters. If you're trying to make them care about 5 or 6 of them, you're bound to fail, especially with mediocre or boring acting. This is why it was probably a hard task to make a movie from this graphic novel."

I've heard some comments about it from the radio and that's about it. It started off ""okay"". I was a bit confused w/ the random flashbacks...but I had hope. It will get better. <br/><br/>Then it just goes down hill from there.

Too many subplots (most of which come out of nowhere, and go no further). The only people I could suggest watching this movie would be the fans of the original graphic novel. Maybe those people will actually have a clue what was going on. As for the directing I'm not going to comment. I don't know what the film was even supposed to be about, so I'm not sure if Zack Snyder succeeded in ""pulling off"" the original context. As it is he didn't do it for those of us that never read the material. In summary, the characters are two dimensional, the plot is dizzily boring and confusing at the same time, and by the time you get to the end you don't even care if nuclear war happens or not (I was rooting for merely to destroy the miserable excuse for Nixon).<br/><br/>Just my two cents, your opinion might differ.<br/><br/>-Fuzzy"
"thefilmguy7","10","38","65","29 July 2009"," Watchmen is a cinematic masterpiece
","Amazing film. Bringing a graphic novel as layered and complex as the Watchmen to the screen is no easy task and Snyder did a brilliant job. Watchmen was as unconventional, intellectual, cerebral, and unique to the cinema world as much as the graphic novel was to the comic book world. It's hard to not compare this to the novel but as a film it is brilliant. Zack Snyder truly did the story justice. Look around online at where other filmmakers before him wanted to take the film. There was even one script where they updated it to be in present day and have the threat be from terrorists. Snyder single handedly saved the Watchmen from a cinematic nightmare. He had the script reworked into the closest adaptation of any graphic novel to date. I would like to shake his hand and thank him for being one of the few filmmakers these days that actually cares about being faithful to the source material of film adaptations. Beyond being faithful, Snyder brought an amazing style and vision to the project. He brought an independent film sensibility to a big budget picture which not many people have the guts to do. I don't think enough can be said on what a great job he did. <br/><br/>I think some of the complaints people have about this movie is interesting because they are very contradictory. Some say the film is too short and some say it's too long. Some say that the movie suffers from sticking too close to the book and others say it's from not sticking close enough to the book. From beginning to end I can't say there wasn't a single moment when I checked the time. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this film. I also speak from a fan's perspective when I say that this movie is probably the closest adaptation of a comic book to date. Yeah there are some details left out but there are already people complaining about the length. Imagine how many people would complain if this movie actually had every single thing from the book in it. It would be like five hours long! The fact of the matter is that the spirit and the heart of the book is definitely present in every moment of the movie.<br/><br/>Some people are also complaining about the music used in the film. With exception of maybe a song or two I loved the soundtrack. Since the film is a period piece, and these characters are such a big part of American history from the 1950's on, it makes sense to blend the music of the times into these characters lives. This is the story of what would happen in our world if these characters existed in it. In our world music is very tied into our history. I just really don't see the big deal. I think it's just because people aren't used to hearing this sort of music in this genera. Again this just goes to show that this movie dares to be different from the rest. <br/><br/>I think the problem for the non fans of the book is that they just thought this was going to be another X Men. THIS IS NOT THE X MEN or is it any other super hero film you have ever seen before. This is risk taking super hero story. It's got the spirit of an independent film. It is truly unique. I saw some parents brought children to see this film. Wow great parenting. This isn't a movie for children. It has extremely graphic and gruesome violence. It has sex and nudity. Watchmen earns it's R rating. Yeah it still has the action and the fight scenes audiences have come to expect from a super hero movie and they are certainly impressive. Unlike other super hero films though the action scenes aren't what drives the story. This is a character piece. The film, like the novel, takes it's time developing the complex history of the characters and the world they live in. Each character is so rich and unique that it's very hard to find a favorite. The actors are perfectly cast to bring these characters to life. It's as though they are jumping out of the pages of the book. <br/><br/>Watchmen is definitely under appreciated and under rated. It's a shame that mainstream audiences didn't really seem to get it. Then again these are the same people that made Transformers 2 one of the biggest hits of the summer so it's almost a compliment that they didn't get it. Like Fight Club, Donnie Darko, and The Fountain, Watchmen will find attention from a more intellectual group of people that can actually appreciate all of the nuances, philosophy, and social commentary that this film has to offer. Apparently this is too smart and cerebral for the typical audience member. Watchmen dared to be different in a time when most films are afraid to challenge conventions. Films used to be praised for that. Apparently not any more. If this came out ten years ago it probably would have met more success but these days people don't want to think at the movies. They just want conventional and simple. It's a shame but I have a feeling that Watchmen will find a larger audience on DVD. It is an experience that should not be missed. It's the freshest super hero story ever told."
"spypsycho","4","22","35","14 November 2009"," There was a good reason they called the novel ""unfilmable""
","Watchmen. My favorite book of all time. One of the most famous graphic novels ever written. Its depth and meaningfulness almost unbearably grand. And who was chosen to direct the film adaptation? Zack Snyder. The guy who became famous for remaking ""Dawn of the Dead"" and directing ""300"". Now, don't get me wrong, I quite enjoyed both these films, but couldn't anybody see who unsuitable he is to make ""Watchmen""? His films were visually outstanding but none of them had the plot and character depth that ""Watchmen"" required.<br/><br/>I first saw the trailer the second it emerged on the internet. The shots were promising but nothing was really revealed. A smart trick that made me pay 8 to watch it. But from the first scenes I realized I was in for a very disappointing treat. First I want to point out that Snyder did get some things right. The detailed sets that portrayed Alan Moore's alternate 1980's were really well made and so were the character's costumes. But it seems that after the director took care of these two, started derailing from the graphic novel.<br/><br/>I really do not know where to start with what was wrong. The characters, although reciting extracts from the novel, had lost their depth and became marionettes, traveling from one ""visually majestic"" shot to the other. The film became really violent and gory and I really don't mind that, I've seen much worse, but the violence simply didn't seem to fit. It was pointless and graphically shot in a similar way to Zack Snyder's previous films without though serving any cause. Many important scenes were savagely shortened in order to make the fighting scenes longer. Rorschach's narration, although extracted from the book, was turned into another cliché, low-voice, tough guy narration, that reminded me of so many other films like Sin City and The Spirit. The plot was also inexplicably changed in so many ways that distorted almost every single one of the book's messages.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder did not shoot the novel's adaptation. He just used the atmosphere and alternate reality created by the genius of Alan Moore to create his own piece of visual extravaganza and use its background to promote it. And just to make things clear, this film was not just a bad adaptation of the novel. It was a really disappointing film in general, and my friends who have not read the book agree with me. His three hour ""epic"" is visually amazing just like ""300"" was, but simply does not work with the plot. This story deserves a better film but I hope nobody attempts to make it again."

","I haven't read the book/comic.<br/><br/>Now that i have made my condition clear, let me tell you i hardly was able to keep my eyes open through the movie, trying to find a bit of interesting aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>This had a very lean script with bunch of useless flashbacks pulled in to say the heroine is a mad guys daughter (i mean ain't it a little idiotic showing a big jigsaw for almost nothing - point being the world is a big joke - killing 15 million people is the best way to save the world is synonymous to her life story?) For readers of the book this movie may have made a great viewing but for me this plain was a dumb movie. The action sequences looked huge but not thrilling, the zillion dollars given to Snyder was used but not very helpful. Where was the thrill in the movie? It looked like a upgraded Bollywood (Mumbai movie industry) movie.<br/><br/>I loved 300 his previous movie which made me watch this movie and within 1 hour of this movie screening I could hear the guy in the seat next to me snore. I really doubt was I in a different movie.<br/><br/>Two hours and forty minutes wasted in watching in what looked like a costly mega-serial from TV being sewed together and shown on a movie screen with few of its episodes missing and the rest shown in wrong order. Especially when almost all movie seemed to be in slow motion, was the theater projector having some defect? <br/><br/>Character description for half the characters was lost and missing. How would it be to watch the last part of Lord of the rings without watching the first 3 parts? <br/><br/>But after reading most reviews in this website i guess this is my conclusion - Seems as if some one threw the script through a roof and it was picked up all in wrong order with many pages of it missing."
"daliaelg","1","195","383","12 March 2009"," Why?
","Why? why? why? if this movie was so difficult to make than why did Snyder decide to take it on. Unlike many of the people in the united states, i have unfortunately never read watchmen, or even heard about it. I checked the rating out on IMDb and decided to see it. while i sat through these painful 2 hours and 40 minutes, i really didn't want to know anything about them or even hear about them again! how this movie ended up with a rating so high beats me!!! i'm sorry to all those people who say the negative comments are coming from people who haven't read the graphic novel, but a movie is a movie, it should stand alone, i'm supposed to understand mostly everything even without having read the book, otherwise the makers of the movie should have made the book a prerequisite to the film!!! there were just too many plots happening all at once, very very very long introduction, that i lost interest in all the characters long before intermission, and gave up on seeing anything that would impress me.<br/><br/>It did hit me at the end of the movie that this movie was made by the same people who made three hundred, and really the brutal and aggressive messages behind both movies disgust me. How many times does he have to ram the necessity of force or sacrifice for one party to gain what they believe is right. I guess my ideology differs greatly to Mr.Snyder, but killing people is never justified in my opinion. Asides form that the point of the movie was presented so shallowly, and it seemed like all the characters had very rash motivations that weren't justified.<br/><br/>the movie events and character choices just didn't make sense to me!! and the soundtrack that everyone says is fantastic, it really isn't due to fantastic directing, just great songs, for the likes of bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, and Leonard Cohen, the songs will always sound great because they are, unfortunately what i don't like is how literal the movie is and how obvious it is in it's symbolism, the music was like a commentator on the action, that was rubbing it in our faces.<br/><br/>overall just not very subtle, entertaining, or enriching, i walked out of this movie as i did in 300, disappointed, agitated, and vowing never to see a Snyder film again. And i believe this one will have been my last."
"mviise","1","217","429","8 March 2009"," Don't reward slavish graphic novel adaptations!
","I am a movie and novel buff who has not read the book version of Watchmen. The book may be very good (friends tell me it is) but I can verify that the movie is awful. This is the problem: you fans of the book come to the movie already caring about the characters, while movie-goers depend upon the movie alone to give them a reason to care about the characters and the world they live in. (Which brings me to another problem: no one cares about saving the seamy rightwing version of the infinitely corrupt world of the 1980s. If that negative fascist fantasy dies in an explosion, good riddance. Isn't that the fulfilment of the rightist fantasy?) The movie fails mostly on this count, though there are other weaknesses. (I'm talking to you, slo-mo spacecraft sex scene.) I found myself caring only about Rohrschach (well-acted by Haley). The big blue guy did not seem to have any real dilemmas and absolutely no emotional depth, the diabolical plan of the hero-villain was obscure until it was revealed and too late to care, and nothing lost seemed worth shedding a tear for. As for the rest of the world and the characters, I just could not wait for the impending nuclear holocaust because then I would be able to go home. And I'm actually a very peaceable person who in real life doesn't wish instant vaporization on anyone. Several people left early, which I have never seen in a movie theater before. (I guess I've never been to a movie that spent this many hours being bad.) In sum, worth the money only if you love all things Watchmen and, perhaps, if you really liked Forest Gump and Moonraker. (Having said this, I could have watched a whole movie about the giant blue guy winning the Vietnam War. That scene was pretty cool.)"
"Spleng","1","155","301","15 March 2009"," Puerile, sophomoric drivel
","In what has to be the final spasm of the superhero genre, ""Watchmen"" displays the narrative bankruptcy and dramatic inadequacy of an Uwe Boll movie.<br/><br/>Tired, dull characters in Spenser's Gifts outfits flouncing around in a boring plot that moves along like your Grandma's childhood memories.<br/><br/>The dare here is that the audience will actually be bothered to stay with the quasi-fascist, ""individual-hero-as-Messiah,"" BS long enough to make it to Dr. Manhattan's realization that the birth of his latest squeeze - the result of her mother's attraction to a former rapist ""superhero""- is close enough to a miracle for him to give a crap about the human race.<br/><br/>I'm off to Mars."
"djl1187","1","126","242","24 March 2009"," Ungodly long - too many errors - and just plain Bad
","My initial thought after leaving the movie theatre for WATCHMEN was that I had just paid ten dollars to see a movie which should have gone straight to DVD. First, it is a horribly written script - dialogue should do two things in film: reveal character, or advance the plot. Too many times did they have unnecessary scenes (the fire rescue followed by sex scene?) and dialogue which had nothing to do with the two points mentioned. The soundtrack of the movie was mostly songs from the 60's and 70's even though the movie ""takes place"" in the the 80's. They should have gone with a Hans Zimmer style of orchestra not the cheesy jimmy Hendrix all along the watch tower - it just doesn't fit in with the movie (none of the songs do), this isn't Forrest Gump it's a ""crime comic book drama"" if you can even call it that. Again with the dialogue, too many times are they telling you instead of showing you (visually or through dialogue) what they are doing or what is happening - the director doesn't give the audience enough credit. Take a look at the errors section for this movie, the list is endless more than most any other movie out there (I won't even go into all of those errors and how bad they make this film). Terrible acting overall too. Roarshach looked like a Danny Bonduce knock-off, and that mask he had was a ripoff from Batman begins (when he puts it on and is like ""tell me what you see"" to the doctor so dumb - trying to be like the scarecrow). And Billy Crudip the best actor in the movie we don't even know he's in it - because he's a blue guy with no emotion. Zack Snyder couldn't figure out if he wanted to make this like a comic book movie or a real drama action - and that really hur the movie. There are too many stupid little fight scenes that have no point in the end all product of the movie. In the end, you need more than a bunch of explosions and blood spilling to make a good film. Definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br/><br/>P.s. The rape scene between the comdeian and that lady - so unrealistic, it's like they have a choreographed rape scene..I mean c'mon - so cheezy. Also very cliché' to have the comedian be the Father to the girl -saw that coming form a mile away."

"Vinicius8","5","7","9","13 October 2016"," Watchmen: They watch and judge men, yet they are just another one of them.
","Watchmen has a contrived story. It criticizes human nature but it can't depict it. In the beginning it gives off a satire vibe (the comedian that thinks society is a joke and the intro scenes about the north-American ""history""), but in the long run the movie loses its thread and ends up pouring some social critic there and some bad ass superhero cliché here. The result isn't bad for the laical audience, but it gets boring for those who enjoy something profound and philosophical. What I did appreciate in Watchmen was the darker theme of it even though they lightened the mood through the hours. And talking about hours, I have read that the movie stayed true to the comics, even too much, turning the almost 3 hours of duration a bit excruciating in the last 60 minutes or so. The first scene got me much excited for the movie, because the directing and special effects used on it were absolutely fantastic, but no other scene in the movie had the same quality, it's like the director shied away from the idea, afraid of creating too big of an impact on the audience, but that's when he got lost and simultaneously lost the movie. Some of the remarks of the characters, even if a bit out of place and very emotionally dry, are still smart and real. For example, in the scene where the Comedian shoots the pregnant woman, Dr. Manhattan asks him how could he do that and he immediately shifts the blame to the blue superhuman, questioning the same why did he not do anything to stop him. That scene got me thinking for a second, about how disconnected we as human beings can be to one another, ready to criticize others acts while we do nothing to stop them from doing it, and the scene also made me go ""WTF"" as to the Comedians instantaneous response to Dr. Manhattan, like he was a third person in the events, because he acknowledged his crime as something wrong but yet wasn't emotionally connected to that fact. The comedian was the flaw in society that he alone saw. Yet he did not change himself. This would be acceptable behavior if not for his breakdown later shown in the movie. So who is he after all? That question is valid for every character, and being able to question yourself that is very bothersome in the process of appreciating a movie. In the end what I can say is that if you are someone like me that appreciates satires, human behaviorism critic, psychological and thought inducing films, don't even bother watching the Watchmen."

","The introductory credits sequence for the movie Watchmen was amazing. It could be that i liked it because i like comic books, as well as the stories with alternate history. The rest was interesting, but only for comic book aficionados. The others might have had problems in staying awake.<br/><br/>The reason for initial excitement and later disappointment lays in the story itself. Back in the day when Watchem appeared, the story has been rather interesting. But so many years later it is just one of many comic books brought to screen and one of many alternate histories presented to the broader audience.<br/><br/>This combination was still potent, yet the complicated plot demanded a slow pace which, in turn has been simply too slow."
"dinhwood","5","31","53","10 January 2010"," A faithful adaptation, which means it misses the point
","WATCHMEN is one of the most important texts of the 20th century. As a deconstruction of the concept of the superhero and a sharp analysis of the paranoia of the Cold War, it defines and diagnoses the period in which it was released. It also deftly demonstrates that the comic book can be a serious art form.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder gets the majority of the key moments from the comics yet misses almost all of the themes. For one thing, everything looks too perfect, too clean, too rendered by computers. Dave Gibbons' art was deliberately grungy, fitting the dystopian alternate America of the narrative. Night Owl and Silk Spectre come together because they're lonely old heroes -- they're out of shape and struggle to regain both the fire to fight crime and the timing and physical moves they used to know -- but Snyder makes them in-shape ass kickers capable of taking out thugs in an alleyway or murderers in a prison riot. The violence in the original was brutal but also frequently just suggested but Snyder makes sure we see people get their arms cut off or their teeth break.<br/><br/>The film is poorly cast, with only Jeffrey Dean Morgan grasping the narcissism that fuels the Comedian's desire to be a hero and his regret over his life and Jackie Earl Haley reaching the unsettled morality of Rorschach. Malin Akerman appears to be reciting her lines phonetically, Matthew Goode is a non-entity as Ozymandias, and Carla Gugino mugging underneath some of the worst aging make-up in cinema history. Bily Crudup is lost beneath mediocre CGI that makes his lips look like rubber bands wavering near where his mouth should be.<br/><br/>That said, it moves pretty well and is entertaining enough, I guess, and Morgan's best moments capture exactly what Moore was going for. It's worth watching... but as an adaptation of a comic book miniseries that is a must-read, that's not good enough."

","This was (dare I say) perfect in the comic book movie genre. I absolutely loved all the characters especially Dr. Manhattan. There was a scene that certainly is not intended for children's eyes, but its not over the top, meaning I have seen worst graphic scenes in Indiana Jones, notably the villains death scenes at the end of each.<br/><br/>They stayed true to the comics and I love the universe they created with Nixon in his 5th term in office, etc.<br/><br/>There are a lot of flashbacks and I think flashbacks within flashbacks but its all good, it wasn't confusing to me and flashbacks within flashbacks can be very confusing if done wrong. The director did a great job wielding the story lines together in 3 1/2 hours. Superb visuals and a fantastic storyline, I was a little upset at the end of what happened to one of the characters, but hey can't have everything.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who loves comic book movies, however this isn't like your normal comic book movies, as it is grittier and darker then most (think of Sin City or 300). It takes the genre in a different direction much like how Chris Nolan did with the recent installments of Batman (which I also love).<br/><br/>The movie deals with current themes in our world today and for that I think this makes the movie timeless. I certainly can't think of why all the hatred for this movie. Not only did it completely stay true to the original comic, but it did this in such stylized fashion. I have decided that Zack Snyder can do no wrong. <br/><br/>I think most people didn't like this because they thought it was boring. Well if a good story must have non-stop action then this and most movies are not for you. There is great action, yes, but there is also depth to the mythology of the Watchmen world."

","First off I never read the book and had the only expectation/hope that it would entertain like League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or Hellboy... not. What a disaster of a film. This plot plods along and stumbles all over itself. Other than a hint of Film-Noir murder mystery and some sudo intellectual babbling by the giant blue Smurf who's genitalia seem to make their appearance with ever increasing frequency for no apparent reason. Gratuitous sex scenes that appear with all the grace of a 70's ""b"" grade porn flick. Graphic violence for the sake of violence. Seemed forced or maybe added just to keep you from falling asleep. Oh and here's an original story, Earth must be saved, humans are the problem. And the attempt to revive the whole ""assured nuclear destruction"" was laughable and forced. Played out like an after-school special. Maybe that's why they had to make the present day 1985 like it was an afterthought. Now one thing that screamed out very early was the constant preaching and tired liberal BS. Dear God, Nixon was elected for a third term. Even jabs at Reagan couldn't be escaped in the closing minutes. The portrayal of Nixon on screen was an unforgivable prancing caricature. It's as if a group of aging liberal hippies who fantasize and relive the glory days of Watergate, fired up their old bong and spit out this entire script. The constant jabs and digs at republicans and/or conservative values was beyond obvious and was downright annoying after the first 20 mins. Tune in for dozens more spattered throughout what is almost 3 hours. Finally, the one shining light in this movie was the performance of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Of course he sounded like a conservative so they had to kill him off before the movie ended. Figures."
"DarthVoorhees","5","65","122","6 March 2009"," Read the Watchmen, rather than watching them
","I don't know maybe after twenty some years Alan Moore was right all along, Watchmen is unfilmable. It isn't to the fault of this film which is essentially a faithful and good intentioned adaptation of the story. Maybe in all his eccentricities Alan Moore was on to something. A comic book is meant to be read and not projected in front of you. Watchmen works best as a graphic novel to sit down and read and wrap your mind around. The Superhero film can be good even a masterpiece as Christopher Nolan showed us last year but the comic book film well that may be a different story, particularly when we are adapting the Citizen Kane of comic books...<br/><br/>Zack Snyder is a director who I think has tremendous potential. If I were a producer at Warner Bros. he would have been my go to guy to direct Watchmen as well. For his part the film looks beautiful and has scenes that look like they were taken from frames of the original Watchmen novel. Snyder is not to blame for Watchmen's mediocrity, if anything he makes the film the least bit worthy of a view. The problem with Watchmen lies in it's screenplay which is faithful to the story but not to the spirit.<br/><br/>A word for word adaptation of Watchmen would have been impossible, essentially the meat of the story is still there. The dialogue that had so much meaning in the comic doesn't have any here. I don't know if it is because of the acting or the screenplay, but the context that Moore intended doesn't come across to the viewer. It really is disappointing because Watchmen was a thinking man's comic book. Manhattan's monologue on Mars is essentially unchanged but it doesn't engage the viewer like it does the reader.The characters are there but they aren't fleshed out and we don't develop relationships with them despite some very strong performances. Crudup is actually quite good as Manhattan, but I wasn't engaged or filled with awe despite the fact that the CGI is incredible. Watchmen is a grand story with operatic scale but in the context of the comic book, the subtle details are all gone in film form. Watchmen is a story where you need the big picture to make it work and for the sake of making Watchmen a motion picture these details are there but they are passed over before we can comprehend them. The political satire, the philosophical debates, and the commentary are all but absent. What we get is the surface or the indication that they were once there. I saw Watchmen with my sister who has never read the novel, she was checking her watch the entire film. It is simply is very different in motion picture form despite being the same.<br/><br/>In these times of economic uncertainty I forked over nearly forty bucks to see Watchman with tickets and drinks included. To prepare myself for the film I bought a twenty dollar reprint of the comic. Do yourself a favor and buy the book and then rent the movie at a more reasonable price."

Dr.Manhattan was so overpowered and disconnect from that world, as well as the viewers. Nightowl II is the watered-down knock-off of batman, with no backbone. Why either of them were interested in Silk Spectre II, nobody knows. None of the scenes proved the characters to be ""superheroes."" Merely people who know kungfu or have technology to blow your face off (see: the army). The only 'super' one was Dr.Manhattan and he was TOO super with no weakness.<br/><br/>There was some big ~*twist at the end, which was entirely expected, but the way that the ""heroes"" ~*accepted the event and just cried about it for a couple minutes made for a horrible, unepic story.<br/><br/>Silk Spectre II's life was a joke and so was this movie."

The voice of Dr.Manhattan is just irritating, also the appearance and the behavior of Ozymandias is also very very poor.<br/><br/>The special effects are annoying at best. Constant slow motion, crappy flashbacks and irritating sounds.<br/><br/>The story is changed in small, but irritating ways. I mean the violence is blown out of proportion, but the body of the comic, the whole point of it all just disappeared. It just became a big budget, commercial, Hollywood action movie.<br/><br/>After watching this i really doubt the intellect of Snyder, the comic is a brilliant piece of work, and it's really hard to ruin it, but he did it, well actually that is an amazing feat.<br/><br/>All in all the film is a huge disappointment and just gives the comic a bad name. If it were up to me I'd give a different synopsis something like blood, slow motion, and 3 hours of total boredom and irritation. Alan Moore was right not to take credit for this piece of crap."
"shthrash","2","48","90","8 March 2009"," Just Awful
","Though it wasn't until about an hour in that I had realized this film was not going to treat the source material with dignity, it was the opening scene of The Comedian's assassination that encompassed everything that was wrong with the film. The actual killing takes about three minutes to happen after the assassin shows up, which is two and a half too many. Their fight goes on as the comedian punches through walls and is thrown through just about every glass object in the apartment before being tossed out of the window. By the time he is killed we've already been taken out of the moment by a ""stylistic"" fight scene. Totally defeats the point of a shocking beginning.<br/><br/>And that's basically what this film does. It throws around the fight scenes and sex scenes and gore without any notion of their weight. No thought is given to nuance, just spectacular visuals. The main intellectual aspects of the original comic (which are the entire reason it was such a landmark) are almost completely ignored.<br/><br/>The characters are also completely dumbed down. Rorschach is no longer a creative, interesting face to a hero but a batman ripoff vigilante. The entire back-story with his mother is surmised in a brief flashback, which has the line ""I should have had that abortion."" Really? Couldn't the Nite Owl-Silk Spectre sex scene with the idiotic flame been taken out to make room? The only characters treated with any dignity are Veidt and Dr. Manhattan, though they are portrayed only adequately and no more.<br/><br/>Basically, the film is superfluous, simplistic, and rife with juvenile humor which belongs nowhere near the Watchmen material. Snyder's approach worked with 300 mostly because the graphic novel itself was focused on epic battles and nothing else.

","The success of ""Watchmen"" is another indication that we're moving away from everything that was dear to me in the movies. Technically brilliant, I presume, but not a single indication of humanity as we know it. In the dialog and intention, of course but in practical terms, zilch. The fact that Billy Crudup's Dr Manhattan sports an Olimpyan style penis that doesn't even make you blink should tell you something. It's all so far removed from human emotion. The men, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Goode and the aforementioned Crudup are thoroughly feminine. The women, Malin Akerman and Carla Gugino, beautiful masculine creatures. The only one depicting some shape of a real character is the wonderful Jackie Earle Hayley. To tell you that the film depressed me is to tell you only part of the story. ""Watchmen"" is an amusement park ride, one of the most boring I've ever taken. For the devotees of the genre, perhaps, this thing provokes some kind of pleasure, I don't know but for me this was torture. I'm not giving it a 1 (awful) because Mr. Hayley deserves some respect and I must say that Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson are among my favorites of the new generation but they will be demoted in my estimation if they're going to put their talents at the service of things like this."
"Billy_Costigan","Null","114","232","6 March 2009"," A Dark Insight into the Superhero World
","Starting off, I am just reviewing the film overall and not taking in account any of the written sources it's based off. Watchmen seems to be a complex film, and I'm sure and extremely hard to make an adaption of. It seems with dealing with material, such as this one, it's almost impossible to please everybody. <br/><br/>Watchmen is a about a team of superheros that look after or ""watch"" the world around it and society which is supposed to take place in 1985. Be warned: this is not your regular superhero movie. Watchmen seems to reveal a much darker existence and reality into their world, the world of these superheros that we have seen so many times before. This isn't teenage Peter Parker, running and flying through the streets of New York. This is a much darker piece of work including, graphic violence, murder, sex scenes and nudity between these heroes. This film could be described as controversial with all the history, themes and meanings it goes through. It expands through many historical events, such as the Vietnam War and the Nixon Presidency.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a murder and a mystery that surrounds it. (As it is said in the plot.) This side of the story was very interesting and entertaining. It kept my interest going forward, not knowing what to expect. Interesting, and suspenseful with a sort of realism to it. Then the film sort of gradually goes off into more of a fantasy setting, with a whole bunch of outer space, mystical objects, creatures, and end of the world hints. I didn't really care for this side of the story, but it is sort of a fantasy superhero film, based on the graphic novel, so I can't knock it for being what it is supposed to be. What I didn't like, was how long it took to actually discover what was going on with the plot, which turned out to be a bit confusing. There was a bunch of goofy and corny parts, which really wasn't needed or could have been done better. The sex scene for example, seemed kind of forced and awkward. <br/><br/>Now to the characters since its more of a character driven piece anyway. Oscar nominated actor, Jackie Earle Haley, completely stole the show as Rorschach. Every time he wasn't on screen, I just kept waiting for him to come back. I loved his character and his storyline. There's not enough good things I can say about him and his performance. Him alone, makes the film worthwhile, in my opinion. Just what if the others could be as good... Well for Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II, I can't say she was bad, but not all that great. It seems obvious that she was pretty much put in this film as eye candy, which she definitely succeeds at. Overall, I liked the rest of the cast and thought they did a pretty good job with a few weak moments (mainly Ackerman). Some of the action sequences seem like they could have been done better. Snyder's style made them look ""out of synch."" <br/><br/>The visual look and feel of the film is well done. The opening credits scene with the song playing is fantastic. The song ""Times are a Changin' by Bob Dylan plays in the background as these credits really set the tone and mood for the film. Beautifully done. Not all of the songs seemed to fit though. Some of them seemed really out of place and even awkward at times. Interesting, dark cinematography with some great visuals. Most of the writing and dialog was great, particularly, Rorschach's scenes and lines. Maybe Haley just made it that much better? There is some weak moments as well mostly with Ackerman's lines. Maybe because some of her weak delivery of some of her lines. Don't mean to pick on her, but she seems to be the weak link in this one. <br/><br/>Overall, Watchmen seems like a dense, deep, complex look at the superhero world. It made for an interesting film, that I just had to see because I was so intrigued by the R rating with the dark graphic nature of this kind of superhero film. It's not perfect, and I'm sure some people won't like it, but a pretty good film nonetheless. If you go in looking for an interestingly done story about a new kind of insight to the dark world of superheros then this film should work for you. 6.5-7 out of 10"

","I'm starting to lose faith in a lot of the ratings presented in IMDb, especially with movies like this scoring 80%+.......seriously people??? <br/><br/>We have a simple case here of users logging on and giving this such a high rating either because: a) the economic crisis is just driving everyone nuts, or b) the 60,000 odd cast and crew were also paid to post up positive feedback in the hope of drawing poor, unsuspecting movie-goers into actually giving this a shot! I'm more inclined to believe that its the latter, and if thats the case the sad reality is that it has actually worked.<br/><br/>I still I haven't met anyone who has watched this film and not comment on how truly abysmal it was - and everyone they know shared the same sentiments. The constantly flashing big blue penis was already quite disturbing/distracting in itself, but not as much as the script itself. I'll admit that I haven't read the comics, and after viewing the film I have no intention whatsoever of doing so. I think its silly for people to assume that if you didn't enjoy it, its because you didn't understand it or you ""haven't read the comic"" - I've seen and enjoyed many films without having read the books/comics that they originated from.<br/><br/>Everything in this film was just lacking on so many levels. The rescue scene followed by the sex scene just about sums up the whole film - it was just non-arousing, boring and pointless. What is it with bad movies and unnecessary sex scenes anyway? The B-grade movie Gabriel had a similar one - and that was the worst movie I had ever seen until I saw Watchmen! Save your money people - this train-wreck won't help you through the financial crisis!!!"

","Well, where do I start?. Several points make this one of the most dreadful experiences I have had in cinema so far. In first place, the gore. I wish Snyder ever realizes that he just doesn't have to splatter the screen with blood every 35 seconds; not to mention body parts, open fractures, exploding bodies.... It is soooooooo useless and soooooooo becoming in a bad movie with no story whatsoever. In second place, the story. It could have been interesting, but it is presented in such a disorganized way, that it make you wonder what was on the mind of the writer and/or director. Three plot lines that, had they been developed, a great movie could have come out. In this case, they were just presented but not even barely developed. Third, the acting, with the possible exception of Rorshach. Maybe they are good performers, but the script was so idiotic that probably this was the best they could do. Fourth, the soundtrack. Very good songs completely inappropriate for the scenes they went with. What sick mind would put Sound of Silence in a cemetery scene, or the movement of Mozart's Requiem with the wrong tempo in the next to final scene. This is really incomprehensible to me. All in all, I give this movie two points. One for the special effects, the second one for the performance of the actor that played Rorschach. See it if you have to, or to form your own opinion."
"Michael Kenmore","2","70","138","7 March 2009"," Pretentious, self-indulgent, incomprehensible tripe
","With all the hype of a long-awaited movie adaptation, I came in with little expectation despite my tepid impression of the trailer.<br/><br/>It turns out this film is slow, pretentious (more on that later), and grotesquely self-indulgent. A fairly good script, co-written by prodigiously talented David Hayter who scripted X-Men movie and voice-acted as Snake in Metal Gear Solid series, has been marred by the film being so overproduced and overdirected it's like watching a farce. For those who are not familiar with the comic book, Watchmen will appear to be one of the weirdest movies ever made, outside of Terry Gilliam's realm. Terry actually tried to adapt the film in development hell in 1986 and 1989, but the project fell apart.<br/><br/>The plain truth is, because of the complexities of Watchmen as a comic book in terms of literal reading experience (that elevates mature comic book to art form), it is unadaptable. The result of the movie adaptation with bizarre & outlandish plot and character arcs is disastrous. The movie is not a clever satire or plausible fantasy as it pretends to be, but rather a preposterously inane farce.<br/><br/>Comic book and film are entirely different art forms, with comic adaptations of the movies weak and awful (i.e. Marvel's Terminator 2) and vice versa. The exception would be well-produced and freely styled adaptation of comic books such as X-Men 2, Ghost World, Iron Man and The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder throws in the gimmicks reminiscent of music video editing styles, with slow motion and cranking motion for dramatic effects. He dwells on the scenes of grotesque violence in slow motion, as though he loves violence, pain and suffering because it's about making acts of violence stylishly appealing contrary to the reality where violence is cruel and uncool. The opening credit sequence may be weirdly cool, but unabashedly pretentious. Zack wants to tell the world he's a ""cool"" movie director who made a zombie movie re-make and an over-hyped box office hit (300) which I called ""fascist art"" in a previous review posted on IMDb.<br/><br/>The filmmakers' love of stylish graphic violence in close-ups, with slow and crank motions for effect, is repulsive. I thought Watchmen is supposed to be an action drama film, but it feels like watching an action movie that interchanges with grisly horror elements, pretending to dispense philosophical ideas of existence. I like nihilism, but not with sociopathic adulation of grisly movie violence as though there's any point. Not to mention an unnecessary, semi-pornographic sex scene that went on a minute too long, which again does not serve to advance the plot, only titillate the audience to discomforted silence.<br/><br/>Watchmen is overlong with some pacing tedium in-between, which makes it obvious the film is not tightened. Zack thought padding the length would make the film at least comprehensible in storytelling, but he fails to consider re-editing because he wants to remain as ""slavishly faithful"" to the comic book as possible, much to the annoyance of the audience who had not bothered to read the comic book.<br/><br/>With the film's flaws as the factor because of the director's sheer indulgence, Watchmen is a fascinating train wreck to watch, from the point of view of a casual comic book reader and current college student in philosophy. Fanboys' adulation of the film as a ""masterpiece"" expose them to be shallow ""me"" generation who think those who criticize Watchmen the movie for whatever reason are uninformed, uncultured morons.<br/><br/>Watchmen author Alan Moore was right to demand credit removal as noticed in the opening credit sequence, with the artist Dave Gibbons' sole credit as ""co-creator."" Because Watchmen is an awful, ludicrously nonsensical movie that will confound the people who has never read the comic book to begin with. I accept the alternative timeline storyline, but the aesthetics of the film is too surreal as a patently absurd fantasy.<br/><br/>The movie is proof some source materials should be left alone because a ""good"" adaptation in another art form is improbable. Therefore, I agree with Alan Moore's protest because it rapes the novel aesthetics of a story meant to be a compelling experience in original art form as intended.<br/><br/>* out of 4"

","The Watchmen, a semi-dynastic group of superheroes with all of the emotional, psychological and even philosophical problems of the rest of earth's human population, has been, essentially, washed up. In his third term as president, and on the verge of WWIII with the Soviet Union, President Richard Nixon has banned super-heroism. Some turn to alcoholism (The Comedian), roguish skulking (Rorschach) or resignation and depression (Nite Owl II) while others exploit and explore their abilities in new ways (Ozymandias and Dr. Manhattan). Yet somebody is going out of their way to hunt them down, one by one. Will the seemingly unbalanced Rorschach succeed in reuniting The Watchmen to prevent nuclear holocaust and to defend themselves against their unknown enemy, and more importantly - WHY are they being picked off one by one and by whom? <br/><br/>Loaded with irony, strong characterization and a cleverly spun plot, The Watchmen is very much worth seeing. The performances are generally very good, though I thought that Matthew Goode's interpretation of Ozymandias was a little too predictable and stereotyped. Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson were stand-outs for me. Malin Akerman was fine, but not really challenged by her role. The effects are appropriate and never over-bearing and the script is much better than average. Well-directed and edited and very well shot, there are only a few unnecessary scenes in this lengthy film.<br/><br/>Unlike many comic book or graphic novel films, the pace of The Watchmen is far from frenetic. Its pace is exactly that of a noir film. Some will figure out who is pulling the strings early on, but will almost certainly be unable to discern why and how. Many more will have a hard time following the film since, like many noir adventures, its course is not really established until it is too late to stop or even impede it. Rorschach, upon whom most of the first half of the film really revolves, provides the complementary angry, ironic and fast-talking' voice-over to complete the noir atmosphere.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, despite the nihilism which underlies so much of the noir genre and was so penetratingly palpable during the real-world cold war, the film ends up being as much about ideological conflict, duality, problems of perspective, and philosophy as it is about millennial adventure. And if you walk away questioning your own concepts of good and evil and the place of humanity in all things, you've paid attention in the open and thoughtful manner the film really demands.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for people with good attention spans. Not recommended for others."

My expectation was that I would be seeing something that is similar to ""The Dark Knight"" in terms of plot lines, powerful imagery, and acting - boy was I wrong! I will give it to you straight: the movie is almost 3 hours long, and has hardly any plot to speak of! Both my girl-friend and I vented our anger about this fact after the screening, and decided that even if it had been a 90-min movie, the plot would not have been able to sustain it.<br/><br/>It will sound hardly believe, but there is actually nothing happening in the movie. That's what makes it so tricky to review it. It is a constant and never-ending series of meaningless dialogues between superheros (although most of them are only martial arts specialists and nothing else), indulging in extreme amounts of self-pity. After about 30 minutes I was hoping that the action the trailer had promised me would start... after 2 hours, my brain was screaming at me to leave the cinema, and when the end credits rolled over the big screen, I realised that I had just been robbed of the hefty entry fee, and 3 hours of my life I couldn't get back. It amazes me how much emotional baggage these people in their stupid costumes can carry around with them. And the ""twist"" at the end of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and screams of illogical mistakes.<br/><br/>Acting was very mediocre, with a computer-animated ""Doctor Manhattan"" probably being the best one among them. The dialogues were about as brain-dead as in ""Casino Royale"" (only that that movie at least had action to sustain it), and the logical mistakes in all this were mind-boggling.<br/><br/>I know that you will hear a lot of positive things about ""Watchmen"", mainly from overweight people who wear their hair in unwashed pony-tails, or puberty-stricken skateboard boys who just see it for the sporadic scenes of unnecessary nudity and violence.

The way the movie started was really good then it was more like a source of noise pollution and there were at least eight instances when I felt the movie should have ended.

The movie is full of slow motion effects and random fight scenes. Any scenes that were trying to be presented as serious did not pan out well.

"Suicide_Saint","5","10","15","4 August 2009"," Flawed Heroes, Flawed Film
","Snyder's Watchmen is a decidedly dark and visceral film which candidly illustrates the flaws of heroes. Unfortunately, this is as detrimental to the film as it is advantageous. It is of importance to note Snyder stays fairly loyal to the graphic novel. However, possibly due to the continuing ""development hell"" that surrounded the film, everything comes across as compulsory and superficial. The aforementioned flaws of the heroes are painstakingly brought to the audiences' attention in fragments. For instance, the Comedian is a rapist, Dr. Manhattan has nearly lost all ability to relate to humanity, Rorschach is blindly obsessed with ""justice,"" and Ozymandias determines the only way to save humanity is by destroying a large part of it. In addition, Silk Spectre II exhibits her adulterous nature in a very awkward sex scene on board Nite Owl II's flying machine. Is the film sounding pretentious? Well, it most assuredly is. <br/><br/>Among the actors there is not an inspired, let alone a stand-out performance. Every character, including our narrator Rorschach, seem merely to be going through the motions. This lackluster presentation from the cast epitomizes the entirety of the film, which is carried largely by grandiose visuals and reliance on the original story rather than any new or interesting interpretation of the work itself. Further weaknesses in the films include the melodramatic musical cues that sound as though they came directly from Snyder's ""favorite iPod play list."" Simply because the film was set in 1985 should not have meant that all of the music featured within the film come before that time period. For instance, it was difficult to contain sneers of disgust as 99 Luft Balons kicks in. Also, songs such as The Sound of Silence, Hallelujah, and All Along the Watchtower are so comfortably familiar that it detracts from the gloomy, unrefined focus of the film. Moving away from musical discrepancies, was the glowing blue genitalia truly necessary? This is one aspect of the graphic novel Snyder could have deviated from without much complaint from fans. <br/><br/>Arguably, the most significant areas of discontentment stems from the closing sequences of the film. These shortcomings will be broken down into three parts. <br/><br/>1.) Ozymandias obliterates a large portion of the population and leads everyone to believe it was the fault of Dr. Manhattan. His reasoning: ""A world united in a peace... they had to be sacrificed."" Given the history of our tumultuous existence as a species, it is difficult to believe this would end in peace. It is far more likely that weapons creators across the globe would immediately begin work on larger and more powerful armaments in hopes of destroying the ostensibly omnipotent Dr. Manhattan. <br/><br/>2.) Ozymandias has effectively harnessed the power of Dr. Manhattan and used it to implement the aforesaid destruction. However, if he had successfully discovered a means to utilize this power, could he not have just as easily used this power to prevent nuclear war entirely? At the very least, this newfound power could have been exercised to wipe out the current nuclear weapons supply. <br/><br/>3.) The remaining characters of the film seem altogether indifferent to the fact that Rorschach was killed by Manhattan, Manhattan was betrayed by Ozymandias, and Ozymandias perpetrated as many or more murders than Adolf Hitler. <br/><br/>Aside from the compulsory nature of the film, limited artistic interpretation from the director, lackluster performances by the actors, poor choice in musical cues, an ending that lends itself to questioning (not David Lynch open-to-interpretation questioning, but ""what the hell were they thinking"" questioning) and let us not forget the glowing blue penis, the film was not without redeeming qualities. The austere demeanor of the film is a welcome change from the typical hero film. Of course Christopher Nolan already perfected this with the new Batman movies, but Watchmen had a noir mystique of its own. The fight sequences, though a bit melodramatic, were choreographed well. Also, as was alluded to earlier, the film is an exhibition in technological progression. These fantastic effects helped to create the feel of a graphic novel. <br/><br/>Watchmen is not a revolutionary film, but it is worth the time it takes to view. It explores the flaws of heroes, delivers a dark, graphic mystique and exhibits stunning visuals all while staying relatively true to the original work of Moore and Gibbons. This reviewer's score is 5/10."

","Many fans are going to this mess of a film and probably enjoying it. Me and my wife went and after about 90 minutes began to play ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"". My other reviews mention the costume dramas she drags me to. This movie was a payback. <br/><br/>Please understand that I have not read the graphic novel yet.<br/><br/>My comments will be brief on behalf of a movie that may have been true to the graphic novel, but seemed to have lost a sense of a strong narrative somewhere around 90 minutes. That first 90 minutes featured some strong direction with plenty of movie references from Wellesian shots, to several Kubrick influences (Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove). <br/><br/>I will put a turning point during the flashback when Dr. Manhattan reveals his past. This section was perhaps my major motivation for seeing the movie. It uses Philip Glass' Koyanisquatsi as its scoring. It is a good series of scenes. But how it contributes to the narrative is unclear to me. it goes on and on. And at some point a choir was added over Glass' music. Did Glass know his music was being altered?<br/><br/>The film has issues with stupid sex scenes, stupid music during stupid sex scenes, violence that seems put in the movie for the sake of violence, and some characters that become as enjoyable to watch as Malcolm MacDonald's Caligula.<br/><br/>My major criticism is that more skill wasn't used to craft a narrative, similar to how Jackson adapted the Lord of the Rings. At 2:40 in length, I hope for either a payoff in the story similar to The Dark Knight, or at least a great cast that keeps the movie enjoyable, like POTC: At World's End. Neither is to be had.<br/><br/>But my major ""what were are you thinking?"" comes from the soundtrack choices. Dylan's The Times They Are A'Changin. Simon and Garfunkel's Sounds Of Silence, Hendrix's Watchtower (maybe that one should slide). Boy, it's nice to see the film uses music from the 80's. And such original choices. Uhhhg.<br/><br/>That goes as well for the high brow stuff, like Glass' Koyanisquatsi from, uh, Koyanisquatsi. Or Wagner's Ride of Valkeries for the Watchmen's fighting in Vietnam (too close a reference to Apocalypse Now's use of it). But the worst was at the end, when Mozart's Requiem pops in for 30 seconds. Oh, come on. If Snyder wanted to really pay homage to Kubrick, maybe he should have studied Clockwork Orange, 2001, and The Shining better for their use of preexisting classical music. <br/><br/>In the end, if the viewer ignores the poorly directed violence, poor music, corny music, and tangential story lines, there is a compelling story of heroes who more closely resemble villains, and the conflict of good and evil within a person.<br/><br/>If you don't want to ignore these choices, just watch ""The Dark Knight"" again."

","The trailer made this movie look great! The actual movie was an absolute disgrace. It was too long, badly edited, acting and script like a bad soap and one weird, weird soundtrack...I will explain! <br/><br/>The plot and storyline jumped everywhere, it just didn't flow well at all. The story was poorly explained and I believe the director tried to fit too much comic into a film and ended up diluting the quality. It was as if bits of the comic book were thrown in for comic geeks sake only, not for the sake of a movie in its own right. The costumes, I know they are based on the comic, are ridiculous, actually comical rather than comic book. The Thunderbirds look cooler and more dangerous than these muppets. The characters are fat and out of shape, with exception of female lead, completely unbelievable, especially when they end up taking on a whole prison with extreme martial arts...The action was rare and poor also.<br/><br/>The soundtrack had some classic tunes but were so inappropriate, it was so random. The film is meant to be based in 1985, it has one scene in the Antartic whilst playing Jimmy Hendrix - All along the watch towers? A song from the 1960's that is synonymous with Vietnam ? It also had a nude sex scene, which are always good, but so inappropriate in this movie and played the Jeff Buckley version, I think, of Hallelujah... that got a good laugh out of the cinema.<br/><br/>One of the random scenes where two of the supposed heroes went on a vigilante spree, and ended up saving people from a fire, was hilarious. The female superhero jumped through a roof with fire and wood dropping everywhere, her hair was for a second everywhere, it instantly shot to her hair being salon perfect...so B movie! There is too much for me to slag off in this movie, people are obviously disillusioned by their nostalgia for the comic books, either that or the nudity...<br/><br/>The only positive things I could recall was the performance of the character 'Rorschach'. The only character that you actually felt anything for and he had one or two good scenes also. The special affects were not bad either but were wasted in this movie.<br/><br/>A few people walked out, I wanted to go but really thought it may redeem itself. It didn't redeem anything, it was terrible. This is the drivel that Hollywood is producing, I can only hope that Xmen Origins lives up to its spectacular trailer..."

","Watchmen falls into a time-honoured trap of comic adaptations: spending a long time on back-stories that really only add to the film's girth, rather than give it any dramatic bite.<br/><br/>It feels like the makers were trying to please too many people. The back-stories were presumably for viewers who had not read the comics - but perhaps also for those who had enjoyed the source material and would have complained about missing characters, plot elements, etc. Given the unavoidable omissions, the catcalls are bound to come anyway.<br/><br/>So Watchmen waddles its way through almost three hours, failing to ramp up the tension due to its plethora of characters and multiple flashbacks. Barely credibly, there are also two even longer ""director's cuts"". Good luck to those who have so much spare time on their hands.<br/><br/>This writer would have preferred a shorter, snappier film which binned the back-stories and focused on one or two characters. It might not have been faithful to the comic - but as its writer, Alan Moore, despises all film adaptations of his work, what was the point in attempting a reverent homage when a creative desecration could have been so much more enjoyable?"

","I never write many reviews but I am just amazed at the surprisingly high ratings ""Watchmen"" has received on IMDb. Though I am a fan of the original comic and feel it is, in fact, a great work of literature and not just a ""Graphic Novel"" I am very capable of separating this review into two parts: the film as an adaptation and the film as a standalone piece: 1.) As an Adaptation ""Watchmen"" is a complete and utter failure. The two most important chapters, IV and VI, are reduced to about 10-12m mins of screen time and yet a fight scene with Nite Owl, Laurie and about 50+ inmates is inserted (not in the comic) along with an excessive sex scene and they last almost 6-8 mins. There is absolutely no sense of the world that Watchmen takes place in and the use of music is atrocious. The most important aspect of the graphic novel is not the mystery plot of who killed The Comedian, it is what is being said and Zach et al apparently did not ""get it"". They delivered a mediocre action film that doesn't convey 10% of the philosophy of Watchmen.<br/><br/>2.) As a stand alone film ""Watchmen"" is a bore. The acting is some of the most terrible I have seen on the big screen in my life. Malin Akerman, Billy Crudup, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Matthew Goode are so bad one wonders how anyone would even hire these people let alone have them star in a movie that costs 10s of millions of dollars. They are stiff, uncomfortable and you feel absolutely nothing for them. The action is not exciting: I actually became bored watching the OPENING fight between Veidt & The Comedian. Somehow Zach Snyder (who made two of my recent favorites in 300 and Dawn of the Dead) was able to make a violent rape scene and the vicious murder of a pregnant woman feel empty and leave me unmoved.<br/><br/>This film is a truly terrible mess that fails on every level."

Here is why: It has a plot, it's not like a sitcom like Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider, it has character development, and amazing special effects and visuals. Also, I liked the setting.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie did a really great job. Jackie Earle Haley plays the angry, vengeful Rorschach, Matthew Goode plays the wealthy, mysterious Ozymandias, Patrick Wilson plays the confused Nite Owl, Malin Akerman plays the sexual Silk Spectre, Billy Crudup plays the god-like Dr. Manhattan, who is the only one in the group who has superpowers, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the violent Comedian. <br/><br/>The violent scenes were awesome, the story was very powerful, and had plenty of twists and turns, the characters were interesting, especially the Comedian, who was the Watchmen's downfall. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a masterpiece and one of my all-time favorite movies. If you have any plans in the near future to see this, and get to the video store and rent it. I highly recommend this because this isn't your typical superhero movie.<br/><br/>Rating:10/10"

Then the montage playing along with Bob Dylan's ""The Times They are a Changin'"" made me realise I was in for a truly memorable experience.<br/><br/>To me Watchmen is what a great super hero movie should be about. Whether the hero has super powers or not it's about the tough decisions, sticking it out when things get messy, and doing the right thing even when you're really not sure what the right thing is. Rorschach's poignant phrase ""Never compromise, even in the face of Armageddon"", is undoubtedly powerful, yet ultimately misguided.<br/><br/>The world needs big, fun popcorn superhero flicks like the MCU brings us, along with their own brand of humour.

","I finally staggered through to the end of the movie, but it was a pretty hard slog; by twenty minutes in my girlfriend had decided that it was boring and found better things to do, and I was seriously flagging after an hour and a half. To be honest, I could have found better things to do than watch the rest of the movie myself.<br/><br/>It's a couple of decades since I read 'Watchmen' the comic, but aside from a few changes to the ending, the movie seems to be a pretty direct copy of the comic to the screen, and that's one of the big flaws; that worked for 300, because it's basically a bunch of action scenes with some talking in between, but a comic as pretentious, talky and full of narration as 'Watchmen' makes for a very dull movie.<br/><br/>And the direct translation from comic to screen is also problematic in another way: 'Watchmen' the comic just isn't very good.<br/><br/>Sure, it may have won a bazillion awards, but ultimately it's a decent idea that was poorly developed; the end result is not particularly interesting characters doing not particularly interesting things while indulging in lefty student philosophising in a not particularly original plot. Had 'Watchmen' been a novel or a movie, it would have vanished into obscurity, it only received acclaim as a comic because so few comics of that era made any pretense at intelligent characterisation or plot.<br/><br/>Another problem is that Moore himself seems to have little sympathy for anyone to the right of Stalin, and a writer with no sympathy for his characters can hardly expect the readers to have much sympathy for them either; Moore can do a good job with a 'superhero' like V (for Vendetta), but every character in 'Watchmen', with the possible exception of Rorshach, is basically a cardboard cutout.<br/><br/>So ultimately we end up with a highly over-rated comic turned into a horribly boring movie where people I don't care about do things I don't care about for reasons I don't care about; and the only mildly sympathetic character is killed off by the others. Don't make the same mistake I did: you can find much better things to do with three hours of your life than watch this movie and then shrug 'so what?' at the end."

"oyason","2","9","14","4 August 2009"," Possibly the worst super hero film ever made
","""The Watchmen"" is a cover of Alan Moore's graphic novel from the 1980s. The story is set against an alternative time line in the United States where Richard Nixon is perennially re-elected, the United States wins the war in Vietnam, and the presence of super-heroes generates public controversy. The characters of the now long-forgotten Charlton Comics universe like the Blue Beetle (Night Owl) and the Question (Rorshach) among many others, are given new names and some extended play in Alan Moore's story. <br/><br/>The Watchmen's world is threatened by the nuclear terrors of the Cold War, and the main defense the United States has left is in the hands of super gladiators like the psychotic soldier of fortune, the Comedian, and the formerly human but now wholly reconstituted Dr. Manhattan, whose self-recreation through Hydrogen fusion makes him near God-like in essence. The streets of New York are guarded by a skeezy street executioner named Rorshach, who defies federal injunctions against vigilantes, and who is one of the more engaging characters in the story. The premise of the novel is pretty silly, and Alan Moore himself calls the work one of his early efforts to write the ""last super hero story"".<br/><br/>Zach Snyder is an ambitious young man, but ambition of the sort that makes movies out of graphic novels like ""Watchmen"" isn't necessarily the same as genius, which is about what it would take to put something as convoluted as ""Watchmen"" on the screen. The sub-narrative of the piece, the comic book within the comic book ""Tales from the Black Freighter"" is essential to ""Watchmen"", and without it, the storyline loses much of its satirical edge. <br/><br/>Worse yet, Snyder lacks all sense of the actual history and the bankruptcy of most mass culture that Moore satirizes so effectively in so much of his work. Nowhere is this clearer than in the ridiculous montage of establishing shots which Snyder created at the beginning of the film which are backed by an extended version of Bob Dylan's ""The Times, they are a'changin'"". As a film maker, Snyder seems obsessed and mystified by the violent excess in U.S. history, which is always a sign of someone who essentially has nothing new to say. Snyder attempts to make up for this shortcoming in his understanding by graphically depicting scenes of violence which are only alluded to in the storyline of Moore's novel itself. And it doesn't help, because, as Malcolm X once said, you can put kittens in the oven but that isn't going to turn them into biscuits. <br/><br/>Hence, what we've got here is three and a half hours of mediocre acting, people most of whom I'm sure are quite gifted in other settings leaping around in spandex costumes and delivering dialogue in a manner that makes the late Jack Webb look like Kenneth Branagh. Hell, as little as half an hour of this sort of thing can be exhausting, but it's funny if you know how, and William Dozier and Adam West proved that pretty conclusively 40 years ago with their farce ""Batman"". Unfortunately, the oh-so-serious Mr. Snyder chose to play it ultra-straight, and in that way lies disaster. Some comic books are better off staying comic books. In the words of Carlos Castaneda's fictional Yaqui Brujo Don Juan, why should a crow be anything but a crow?"

To the ordinary nonbeliever this is just plain crap.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie is much too long and often simply boring. In his effort to give the characters some sort of emotional background, the directors bothers us with seemingly endless flashbacks which do very little to advance the plot. In between we get to know a big smurf, who is detached from mankind and 'normality'. In the end he realizes the error of his ways, because some stupid chick got herself pregnant from the guy who tried to rape her some time earlier and this is -in his view- some kind of miracle. Then there is a girl in a yellow latex suit who leaves the smurf for a geeky loser in midlife crisis, who used to work with some poor jerk who saw some strange stuff in his life and consequently feels justified to beat up, abuse and kill anyone coming close to a criminal or simply getting in his way. Then there is 'the smartest man on the planet' who comes up with a brilliant plan to save the world. All it takes is the death of a couple of million people AND he even gets to change the ways of Richard Nixon. Pretty damn cool! Really guys, the whole movie is a patchwork of poor story, brutality often bordering on the revolting, a little porn and dialog that sounds mystic at first, but turns out to be plain nonsense.

The overall result, with the exception of the rare fight sequence, is a film that is way too long and extremely boring. Over half of the audience in a sold out showing that I went too walked out within the first 45-75 minutes.

There was a a lot of story that needed to be told. Not only was I bored but with the lack of action but the mediocre acting made it even less bearable. I had to wait most of the movie for action.

"rocky_lifter69","6","12","20","28 March 2009"," Tries very very hard, maybe too hard.
","I want to make one thing clear: I REALLY wanted to love Watchmen. It seemed like my kind of movie from the first time I saw the trailer. However, after spending roughly 2 hours and 45 minutes (!!!) of my life watching them, I think I may have been better served watching something else.<br/><br/>I won't go into too many details, as there are way too many crammed into this movie, but here's how it goes: in an alternate version of 1984, superheroes are real, people know and those same people forced them to retire. So now, the world is teetering on the brink of full out nuclear war and one of the former heroes (the biggest a$$hole of the group) is killed. So the other heroes start to think it might have been one of there own. And then the blue guy gets really tall and walks around with his junk hanging out. His girlfriend, sick of doing a blue guy, hooks up with another former hero, the pudgy Nite Owl. And some other stuff happens before we find out that it WAS one of the heroes (the really rich one) that set it up and he also found some way to save the world by blowing up a bunch of cities and blaming it on the blue guy.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie is it's TOO FREAKING LONG. I'm not against long movies but when you could cut almost an hour of the movie and not lose much, something's wrong there. Also, why did they insist on including shots of Dr. Manhattan's junk? Was it really necessary? We get it, he walks around naked and can blow you up by thinking about it.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie for me was Rorschach. Now THAT is how a vigilante should be portrayed. He's like the complete antithesis of Batman: poor, living under his secret identity and willing to kill without a second thought. I wish they could somehow spin him off for his own movie, even though he met a rough end in this one.<br/><br/>Overall, Watchmen strives to be another genre breaking superhero movie like The Dark Knight but it just collapses under it's own weight. Perhaps if Synder had deviated a little bit more from the source material and cut another half hour of unnecessary scenes, this could have been something epic. Instead, it is an overlong bore fest filled with blue junk, a$$hole heroes and sex scenes ending in a flamethrower going off. See it if you are a Watchmen fan but use caution if you aren't."

","Typically if you go and watch a Marvel film you'll get bright colours, a superficial plot, and a predictable ending. Watchmen does not conform to these stereotypes, which is exactly what makes this film stand out in a cluttered market. As with the Dark Knight trilogy, having a storyline that actually challenges the audience makes for far improved viewing. Watchmen's story of an alternate world where superheroes are now defunct changes the dynamic from the start, along with the imminent threat of nuclear war. The vulnerability of these (mostly) human superheroes adds an element of suspense not often found with Marvel/DC films.<br/><br/>The acting in Watchmen is good, but really the devotion to the source material is what elevates the entire film. The comics were so well written (as indicated by their success) that no deviation is required, beautifully set amongst the grime of 1980s Manhattan. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) plays narrator for the majority of the film, a pessimistic ex-hero longing for a return to the glory days; his pursuit of the truth is relentless, but personally Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the undoubted draw. Crudup doesn't have to display much range, but his brutal honestly provides an amazing contrast to the selfishness of human empathy throughout the movie. Visually and musically, Watchmen is also elite - the score samples the best of 80s music, whilst the palette of vivid yellows and blues cuts through the darkness emulating the film's tone.<br/><br/>It's sad that Zack Snyder failed to replicate Watchmen in any of the films he's directed since (Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman etc.) - if he could find this formula again, DC would be in far safer hands. Watchmen cuts itself a niche in a crowded superhero genre, and superheroes are all the better for it."

","Watchmen is based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. The movie takes place in an alternate time-line. Set in 1985, and at the brink of nuclear war, Watchmen will either force you to be open-minded and accept this alternate reality, or reject the very idea of such an outlandish plot-line.<br/><br/>The characters are unique and very human. They make Wolverine (usually considered a brash and thuggish superhero,) look like Clark Kent. Our vigilante crew lacks superpowers , but they make up for it with attitude and maxi. Each member of the Watchmen are very different, so chances are you will end up loving at least one, and hating another.<br/><br/>The movie's opening credits are the real winner here. Set to Bob Dylan's ,The Times They Are A-Changin', you will be hooked from the first second. The colors, costumes, and ""wax museum look-a-like still scenes"" will mesmerize you. Don't Blink!!!<br/><br/>The movie is rated R and rightfully so. Parents should not let their kiddies partake in this orgy of blood, sex, nudity (both male and female,) and violence. This is no Fantastic Four!!! Watchmen is definitely more Scorsese than Superman!!! <br/><br/>At just over 2 hours, the movie's plot and ending lose a little clarity due to the time restraints, but not much. If for nothing else but the colorful scenes and fantastic soundtrack, I would say give Watchmen a try. And if you actually like violence, sex, and superheroes, and haven't yet seen the movie- What the hell are you waiting for??? The movie's music and scenes will stick in your head for days, and you will want to watch it again and again. I already have!!!!!!!"
"AsgerHarlung","1","21","39","17 August 2009"," Good-looking but disappoints in comparison with graphic novel.
","In short: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, see the movie until you've read the graphic novel. It offers nothing that the graphic novel doesn't do better.<br/><br/>If you're not normally into comics, you may consider that this one was elected in TIME MAGAZINE as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present. Yes, novel. The graphic novel ""Watchmen"" really sticks out as full-fledged (and extremely original) literature.<br/><br/>Elaborating: Whenever a movie is made from a story already told in another medium, someone will complain that this or that was omitted. They (okay, now 'we') are always right of course, but other people tend not to care, accepting that the movie 'cannot have it all'.<br/><br/>But then why make it? This question is extra relevant in this case, where the original story was already in a visual medium.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the 'you cannot put it all in a movie' argument is wrong. The 'Watchmen' movie actually demonstrates that a completely loyal adaption would have been possible. It would have been longer, but it would also have been incredibly much better if there had to be a movie version.<br/><br/>Watchmen the movie IS impressive, and until a point extremely loyal to the graphic novel.<br/><br/>The problem is, ALL good things in the movie result from sticking EXACTLY to scenes from the graphic novel. But about one and a half hours into it, it will be clear that you can stop drooling in anticipation of the movie version of the correct ending from the real story. And also that the lack of a lot of background from the graphic novel is rapidly beginning to hollow out the the movie adaption.<br/><br/>So, after an impressively loyal start the movie ultimately fails by deviating from the heavily superior graphic novel.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away (trying to avoid spoilers by only hinting at how differences from the graphic novel discredit the movie):<br/><br/>1) In the novel, Rorschach follows a series of leads concerning missing persons in a storyline that builds up to the climax. The climax of the original graphic novel is radically different from the movie, and the build-up storyline is part of why it's actually devastating. The movie is weakened by omitting this side story..<br/><br/>2) A lot of 'man on the street' sequences from the graphic novel are omitted. These scenes revolve around a street newsstand and its occasional as well as frequent customers. Without these scenes, the movie lacks the 'consequenses for man on the street' interest of the graphic novel, and also removes a lot of human interest from the Rorschach character. Also, the 'pirate cartoon' (which refers to a comic-within-the-comic from the graphic novel, and which has been adapted separately) cannot be inserted in a way that will make sense in an 'ultimate' Watchmen movie cut as planned. (It is a comic book story read by a young man who frequents the street newsstand. Without the newsstand scenes there will be no context for the pirate story).<br/><br/>3) The movie follows Rorschach, Night owl and Silk Spectre. A lot of background about another super hero, Ozymandias, is left out. The background given in the graphic novel serves to make some important points for understanding the entire story, and the movie is weakened by the omissions.<br/><br/>4) As already mentioned, the climax differs from the novel. While good enough seen autonomously, it pales in comparison to the correct ending. And it does smell of ""The Dark Knight"" - so much that I think it's a pure and unoriginal ripoff, and that at the cost of the real storys uncompromising originality.<br/><br/>The movie is still highly impressive 'in it's own right', but it IS redundant where it's loyal to the graphic novel, and finally inferior for not sticking completely to being loyal.<br/><br/>A perfect movie version would have been approximately four hours long (four and a half if counting the pirate story in). The movie clearly proves that a loyal transfer of the graphic novel to cinema was possible. But it fails to be it.<br/><br/>Without putting down it's stunning visuals and it's dark and brooding intelligence, this is NOT an 'ingenious', or 'brilliant' movie. This is just another relatively okay (and certainly well-produced) movie adaption of a novel from which the true brilliance and genius was borrowed, and which you really ought to read instead.<br/><br/>By the way: Why the BLEEP isn't Mozarts Requiem credited in the music list, along with information of conductor, orchestra and record label?<br/><br/>Post edit: Much much later I am finally changing what I almost immediately regretted, namely giving this movie 6 stars. My reason for that was it does entertain to a point (about halfway, where is turn to pure boredom and disgust if you know and like the novel), and it is visually good looking, but so are lots of other movies that differ from this in being worth one's time. Since it completely fails in keeping the stuff that makes the graphic novel great, I don not feel it deserves attention at all, and therefore I have changed to 1 star. This movie simply should not have been made. I never felt an urge to see the movie again, I do regret having ever wasted time with it. Knowing the novel it merely annoys and bores me, and I don't like it."

","The marketing for this movie was first rate. Unfortunately, the movie did not come anywhere near the hype (nothing new there). A movie can appear good in retrospect or after a few viewings, but this movie just keeps on amazing with its ability to get worse.<br/><br/>The overly long boring movie offered nothing. The makers should have worked with the creator and discussed how to have moved it from the comic book to the screen and into the new century. They did not, and ended up with an extremely poor movie. For those that disagree with such sentiments, just look at the numbers.<br/><br/>I hope in years to come they re-make this story but with the creator’s contribution. For now, I only recommend the closing credits. This is one time you want to turn up late for a movie."

","This film will undoubtedly be a paen to the Watchmen fans out there. If you are not already steeped in the mythology of the Watchmen universe, don't waste your time. This movie is a collection of short films for each of the main characters. These independent films are loosely strung together by a silly plot that is revealed with a sophomoric plot twist in the last 30 minutes. <br/><br/>Unless you're a hardcore Watchmen fan, or have three hours to waste avoid this movie like a venereal disease. I stick it through this movie hoping that there would be some point where it became bearable. By the last 30 minutes I was jealous of the people who got up and walked out in the first hour.<br/><br/>If you are looking for any bit of action, there is scant little of it in this film. The action stops and starts intermittent. When there is action it tends to be violent and cruel. Its like the imaginings of a nascent sociopath.<br/><br/>The dramatic scenes don't offer much more to hope for. The dialog is overwrought, over thought, and overacted. Mostly its just BORING. Even the sex scenes are BORING. The blind groping of arthritic octogenarians would be more inviting. <br/><br/>Bad movie, too long, and not worthy of the actors in it."
"Tailslide","1","34","68","22 March 2009"," Worst movie I've seen in the last 5 years
","I'll start off by saying I've never read the Watchmen comic.<br/><br/>This movie might have been a little more bearable with about an hour chopped off of it. There are many scenes that drag along presumably for 'dramatic effect'. If anyone is old enough to remember having to sit through the scene in the first star trek movie where the enterprise is unveiled you know what I mean.<br/><br/>It seemed like there were several scenes where the music was really out of place, and poorly selected or mixed. I mean, it takes place in the 70's, all the music is from the 70's, and then they start playing '99 luftballoons' ? I found the scenes with the Kennedy assassination and Kent State massacre in poor taste but probably younger viewers won't mind.<br/><br/>I get that it's a dark movie and a dark comic but the way the story is told you really have little empathy for anyone in the movie. All through the movie you don't really care who lives and who dies. There is no sense of pacing in the movie, it just seems to random speed up and slow down. It's one of those rare movies that has you tapping your foot impatiently waiting for it to end. The most positive comment I heard coming out of the theatre was a guy telling his date ""It wasn't THAT bad"".<br/><br/>YES IT WAS."
"theboywhocouldntcry","2","33","66","8 March 2009"," A Falling Standard
","From the first view of Nixon's nose (frankly just insulting to the audience) to the end credits brought in by an attempt at a Bob Dylan cover (resulting in some of the worst sounds I've ever heard) I never bought into the film Zack Snyder has made.<br/><br/>The ""visionary"" director brings us an alternate 1985 New York, a New York which looks and feels fake; the result is an immediate disconnect to the characters, which are in effect used as props in the movie. Snyder spends so much time with the look of the movie (the shots, special effects and slow motion) that everything else feels secondary, so much so that when the characters do speak it's jarring. The performances, although pretty good for the most part, are over-shadowed by the film's attempt to recreate the pages of the graphic novel exactly.<br/><br/>Snyder's choices of music, among a very obnoxious sound mix , were misplaced. In the Vietnam sequence Snyder uses ""Ride of the Valkyries"" in order to illicit the feelings and emotions given to us by Apocalypse Now because he is seeming incapable of doing this himself.<br/><br/>This is the downfall of the movie. In trying so hard to be the graphic novel it loses what it should be as a movie. Why try to copy something exactly as it is? The answer is lack of creativity, originality, and artistic prowess.<br/><br/>This film will be talked about for decades, unfortunately because of vast leaps in the field of penis CGI physics and the most ridiculous sex scene of all time."
"smartaffair","2","29","57","11 April 2009"," Yummy self-important dialogues and numbing gore.
","I grew up a fan of most superhero comics. Now I enjoy a costumed hero movie from time to time. The Watchmen were not in my repertoire so I was curious about it. Compared with the recent burst of superhero movies, this movie was interesting in it's use of a darker, historical revisionist propaganda look with a gay-fetish twist.<br/><br/>But interesting does not necessarily mean entertaining. It's similar to when you are dragged through the museum of the tedious and you finally see something interesting but then you want to scream and run out for the doors. The looks of this flick where cool, but that was not sufficient to carry this piece into the entertainment category. Numerous segments were tedious. For example: The constant use of self-referencing flashbacks. Another example? The over-cool, ""we are so self-important"" and humorless dialogues. Another example? The useless scenes of torture and gore. Another one? The constant use of internal jargon. The cherry on this intriguingly stale cake? The character called ""The Comedian"" was about as unfunny as they get. OK enough already.<br/><br/>If you like movies that are self-important, disjointed and gory, this is for you.

"hourglass44","1","36","73","23 March 2009"," Orgasmic for comic book geeks, boring for the rest of humanity
","In a way, this movie perfectly encapsulates everything that is a comic book - a pseudo-intellectual and pointless action/adventure for the sexually repressed.<br/><br/>Let me first say that the special effects were dramatic. Rorschach's journey is also mildly interesting.<br/><br/>However, the film's central gravity -- the characters' struggle with the prospect of imminent nuclear war -- is just dated at this point.<br/><br/>Vietnam, Nixon, the Cold War -- give me a break! Who cares?! These themes have been hashed and rehashed a thousand times over, and it's no longer interesting. You are going to have to come up with something a little more inventive to keep the audience entertained. And if you're held hostage to a boring and trite comic book script, then you shouldn't have made the movie to begin with. The story, quite simply, SUCKS.<br/><br/>There is nothing emotionally gripping about seeing a clown-faced Richard Nixon in a bunker somewhere grappling over whether to take the U.S. to Defcon 1 in an imagined parallel universe. There is nothing ominous about the Soviet Union in 2009. Had the movie been released twenty-five years ago, maybe things would be different.<br/><br/>Further, the resolution to this childish fantasy is even less impressive - it's a straightforward rendition of the utilitarian vs. deontological moral debate presented to the audience as if the storyteller was the first person in the history of the earth to have ever contemplated it.<br/><br/>Plus, I don't know about anyone else, but I don't need to see a blue dick waving around on the screen every five minutes.<br/><br/>I would have rated this movie a 3 or 4 for the action sequences alone, but I feel a need to balance out all the hysterical 9s and 10s that are being assigned: 1/10."
"The_highlander","3","32","64","8 March 2009"," Overrated mental disorder eye candy.
","I had a friend that own a video rental store who was a huge fan of the graphic novel. When heard Watchmen was being made into a movie he was ecstatic. So I had high hopes this would be good. But first time I saw the trailer, I thought ""Huh, that's pretty odd. Superheroes that look like Power Rangers. I thought this was for adults."" I hoped the trailers weren't doing it justice. After a few more came out that looked better I started thinking ""This might actually be a good movie.""<br/><br/>Sadly, that was not the case. The previews before the movie were the highlight of the 3 hours and 30 minutes I spent in the theater. The whole movie dragged on after the first scene, where an old hero is murdered.<br/><br/>Rorschach is the only likable character and the best part of the whole movie. His fight scenes are the most intense, his attitude actually fit the world of ""Watchmen"". The rest of the characters had no redeeming qualities, nothing to attach any real emotion to.<br/><br/>One is a geeky ""rich kid"" whose only apparent purpose in the film was to create unrealistic gadgets and be a part of an unnecessary, forced love scene.<br/><br/>Another is an average looking woman with zero emotional depth, wearing an extremely poor looking costume, and whose sole purpose was to strip so the guys watching have something to drool over. I like nude/sex scenes don't get me wrong, but this one was obviously just for show, it had no passion at all.<br/><br/>These two character's big fight scene happens in a jail house. The choreography and style is reminiscent of Power Rangers. (Their stances, how they jump, the way they fly in the air...) None of their punches or kicks looked to have any power behind them, but anything they hit goes flying insanely away. I kept waiting for them to call their zords. The only redeeming quality of the scene was not using a shaky cam as so many movies use for fight scenes these days.<br/><br/>The last character worth mentioning is the blue man. The explanation of his powers is he got ""trapped"" in a vaulted door machine that sends bolts of electricity at him. But what the machine's purpose was is pretty much disregarded. As he gets trapped a group of people just stand and watch. I guess they never heard of an emergency shutdown. The character's special effects are great, but his explanation is lacking any depth. He ends up with near god like powers; the ability to teleport himself and others, to see his past and future, telekinesis in the extreme, and genius intellect.<br/><br/>After his change he begins disassociating himself with humanity (Although the exact reason for this is shady at best), but he keeps a girl friend, until he cheats on her. I guess even gods who are above humanity still get horny. Maybe he's Greek.<br/><br/>He even attempts to develop technology that will stop a global nuclear war. But again, they portray him as uncaring and beyond humanity the entire movie. It was like a yo-yo. I care, no I don't, yes I do, no I don't. As though the writer had a split personality, each taking control at different moments and wanting a different story.<br/><br/>It didn't make sense. The highlight of his disassociation is when he is made to believe he is causing all the people around him to get cancer and die (yet the time line it happens in doesn't make sense) so he freaks out and goes to of all places... Mars. (Because he doesn't care, yet it upset him). While there, he waves his hand and magically creates a pointless eye candy clock like thing, which serves no purpose but to look cool. Another pointless aspect of him, which is done solely to look ""cool"" is the way he goes around blowing people up, popping them like balloons full of blood. As apposed to teleporting their guns away, or knocking them unconscious. Even removing limbs would make more sense and be more logical. Otherwise, he just walks around nude the whole movie.<br/><br/>There are no real explanations as to how any other character's come by their powers. There is, however, a long unneeded sequence at the beginning of the movie that shows a previous bunch of superheroes who are almost identical to the current bunch. These ""heroes"" act like a bunch of degenerates, raping and beating each other, as though the entire bunch has bipolar disorder. One of the so called heroes even goes so far as to try and seduce his own daughter. In a way it's as though the movie is an allegory as to what if the people who ran Hollywood were superheroes.<br/><br/>The ending made no sense what so ever. The ""heroes"" allow millions to die because they are too crappy at being heroes to save the world. And the whole idea is that an American which the whole world is afraid of and is why they are about to go to war then blows up half the earth but this is what causes all the other nations to decide to disarm their nukes is ridiculous. Its like saying ""Well the U.S. bombed the entire world, and themselves, so we are going to just forget about the supposed nuclear war we were just about to have cause this is different since it was done by a U.S. citizen that we were all supposed to be afraid of because the U.S. might have him use his power against the world, but now that he did, we aren't going to retaliate, like the whole premise of the movie was in the first place........."" WTF?! Did we lose track of our own convoluted plot?<br/><br/>I could go on for days about how bad the rest of this movie is and all the problems it has. It is no where near as epic as the previews pretend and fans of the graphic novel claim. Unless the film butchers the source material in which case I feel sorry for fan's of the novel. The idea of anti-superheroes with adult themes may have been great, but the story is ridiculous and lacks logic. If you must see it, save your money and wait to rent it. At least then you can fast forward through all the needless dialog and shoddy explanations of nothing. If you are into eye candy, pointless passionless love scenes, poor dialog, convoluted plots and zero explanations, you will love this film."
"hasppfh","2","18","33","24 March 2009"," Why did I watch the Watchmen?
","First let me say I have read the graphic novel of this story, and fairly recently (in relation to seeing the movie) and I will relate my comments to this a bit too. I had heard that there were various bad reviews of the movie before seeing it, but I avoid actually reading such comments until after watching for myself...<br/><br/>This movie was visually very impressive, and it was apparent that quite a lot of effort had gone in to keeping close to the mood and the storyline of the comics. There was some success in keeping to the mood, but without explaining anything in any depth and barely grazing at the back-stories provided in the comics due to time constraints, the overall effect was to show a very long sequence of vaguely connected events in a tremendously violent manner which left an incredibly unsatisfactory feeling in the entire cinema.<br/><br/>Again, the effects were beautifully done, and for fans of the comics this surely is important, especially where Dr Manhatton is involved. Unfotunately, more effort seemed to be put into showing our fluorescent nudist than making the characters appear to think with any depth. I accept that even at 160 minutes, there wasn't exactly enough time to do every character justice, but it seemed that in the end, no character was quite filled out.<br/><br/>Rorschach was by far the movie's saving grace, though even he was ruined by a poor back-story and what felt like total character-failure in his final scene. For example, the scene where he is explaining to the psychiatrist the night Rorschach took over ended very abruptly, and with psychotic flailings taking the place of furious, flaming indifference... The result was this character, who should have been incredible, was reduced to being merely great.<br/><br/>Also, the attempts at showing any of the flashback scenes was also pretty confusing, as there was no indication that they even -were- flashbacks (it seemed that only someone who had read the comics would be aware of these plot-points as they happened). Jumping between 1985 and the '50s like that might work in the comics, but it was just... annoying... in a movie.<br/><br/>Of course, as bad as this movie was, I -do- want to see it again at some point. After all, this is the Watchmen we're talking about! I didn't enjoy it the first time, but I am willing to give it another go... Just not at cinema prices next time :P"

The director has tried to give it this violent dark feel but its just violence for the sake of violence. Its not clever like a Tarintino film and makes sense, its just gore.

Music is by Tyler Bates and cinematography by Larry Fong.<br/><br/>1985 and someone is killing all our superheroes. Time for the remaining super heroes to band together - but what they find as they fight the good fight is potential annihilation for everyone.<br/><br/>It was quite a battle getting Watchmen onto the screen, over twenty years of legal wrangling and controversies, it got to the point where fans of the source material doubted it would ever happen - and even if it did it was sure to be a monstrous failure. How pleasing to find that not only did it make it to the screen, but it is also a genre bending winner - well to some of us of course...<br/><br/>One has to take into context just how potent and original the graphic novel was back in 1986/7, we are dealing with very mature themes, superheroes with serious psychological baggage. Alan Moore lit the touch paper in the comic book kingdom that the rest have since followed to keep the torch burning well into the new millennium. Snyder has achieved top line results in getting both the feel and look of the source, even if some of Moore's cunning cynicism has been lost in translation.<br/><br/>Story is set right in the middle of nuclear paranoia and the fear of the Soviets in 85, the America we view is dank and depressing, noirish in vibe (aided by Rorschach's clobber and detective inclinations), it's a world on the road to nowhere. We are also at a time in the alternate world where superheroes are banned from operating, forcing The Watchmen to become vigilantes - that is if they can get along and shunt their psycho discord to one side. The back stories of the main protagonists are fully formed, and these are not jolly characters, so much so you worry the fate of mankind is doomed if these are who we rely on to save us.<br/><br/>There was in no way that Snyder would be able to produce a comic book filmic adaptation that would be as worshipped in that sphere, to rival that of the worship the novel has in its own. However, coming at it as someone who only sought out the source material after seeing the film, it shines bright for newcomers who are ironically seeking darker tints in superhero tales. Oh it has the requisite nifty twists (a clinical mystery to be unearthed), booming visuals, excellent effects work and smartly constructed action set-pieces, but narratively it's moody and calls for the utmost attention on dialogue passages (I have found it gets better on repeat viewings).<br/><br/>Snyder clearly cared about the project and that love is evident in the movie. It was never going to appease all and sundry, but at worst to hardcore Moore fans it's at least an honourable failure, to many others it's a smart and stylishly refreshing genre booster. 8/10"
"Kate_Dammit_Run","5","29","58","7 March 2009"," Faithful Adaptation that lacks any soul of the original
","Watchmen is, in many ways, a faithful, even loving adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. Zack Snyder reproduces many of the scenes, especially early in the film, almost ""shot for shot"" from the book. Most of the major plot points from the book, at least those involving the main characters, make it into the movie. The things which were edited from the book: longer sequences of Rorschach, Veidt, and Silk Specter's pasts, the plot lines with supporting characters, the black freighter sequences, largely make a certain kind of sense as the things you'd cut. Snyder also does an excellent job of establishing the mood of the alternate history and the backstory of the superheroes through a great opening credits montage.<br/><br/>But... the film lacks any real soul. None of the performances stand out. Matthew Goode manages to make Ozymandias more human than he is in the book, at least until the end. Jackie Earle Haley has a moment of snarling greatness near the end, but that's about it. Patrick Wilson brings nothing to the role of Night Owl, and Billy Crudup's tepid delivery harms the portrayal of Dr Manhattan. Snyder's editing out of the secondary characters, while making sense in regards to running time, ultimately blunts the impact of the films climax. Furthermore, Snyder is obviously of rather juvenile sensibilities when it comes to storytelling. While he's cut out many moments of character development he actually INCREASES the time allotted to violence. The book is not actually that violent and most of the more gruesome acts happen off camera. In Snyder's Watchmen we're treated to extremely gory disintegrations and extended slow-mo fight scenes which serve to show off his cool camera technology but do nothing to advance the film. There's also two instances where Snyder takes lines from the book and rather than having them delivered by the actual character, has them delivered as heresay by another one. In the final case this dramatically blunts one of the central messages of the film, ultimately making the line just an offhanded quip. Oddly, given the apocalyptic ending, the film really has no emotional payoff."

","I've read Watchmen a dozen times over the past 15 years and I've been anxiously awaiting this movie. I finally saw it tonight and it was such a disaster that it defies description. There were two worthwhile parts of the movie and they were the cut-scenes at the opening credits and that the movie finally ended after what felt like days. To say I'm a huge fan of the book and that I was excited to see the movie are both understatements. That being said, I was ready to walk out after the first hour. I won't go into detail on why it was so bad, except to say that the soundtrack, direction, plot, back-stories and writing were the worst I've ever seen. The makeup and CGI were laughable as well. This is by far the worst comic book movie I've ever seen, including the 1989 version of Punisher starring Dolph Lundgren. Hang up your spurs Zack Snyder, I've seen skidmarks with more depth than your movie."
"ted-strejcek","1","40","84","13 March 2009"," You have seen superheros like this before.
","In comic books an unarmed man can take out a dozen guys armed with m-16s with the aid of super powers. In this movie, one of the main character's only superpower is a mask that makes changing inkblot designs. And how does he take out the dozen guys with M-16s? With a can of Aqua Net and a lighter. And this entire movie was filled with one nonsensical scene after another just like that. Just think of a scene in the movie, and there are at least a dozen ways that that scene was BS. <br/><br/>For instance, why emphasize a mystery to who Silk Specter's father was, why not instead explain how a 90 pound chick can beat the crap out of 20 escaped convicts from death row during a prison riot? And these problems are not all just a problem with the director, its a problem with the comic book itself. Aqua-net taking out a swat team of guys with m-16s is a pivotal part of the comics, I saw a picture of the page its taken from.<br/><br/>The problem with the Watchmen is the story is comprised entirely of uninteresting superheros, faced with an uninteresting super-villain, and topped off with a uninteresting super-confrontation at the end. Dr. Manhattan builds a giant moving glass sphere on the surface of mars. Why? No reason. Smartest man in the world has a pet tiger with gazelle horns. Where did this creature come from? No explanation. Did this monster attack any of the superheros? No. What was the point? There was none. Even in it's crude attempts to rewrite history were BS. Like Dr. Manhattan blowing up north vietnamese soldiers with a flick of his wrist. Couldn't we do that without a super hero's help in 1972 with our atomic bombs? <br/><br/>If this movie was so imaginative, where was the imagination? Scene with a second gunman at the grassy knoll = JFK. Scene with the president in the war room = Dr. Strangelove. Slow-motion of a guy flying out of a window in a highrise office building = Matrix 2. Dream sequence of an atomic bomb detonating and turning people into burning skeletons = Terminator 2. Blowing up New York and Moscow to prevent World War 3 = Failsafe. Dr. Manhattan = Blue Man Group meets The Crying Game.<br/><br/>The Tag-Line of this movie was ""You have never seen superheros like this before,"" but everyone has. Night Owl = Batman. Ozymadeus = Lex Luthor. Dr. Manhattan = Superman. The Comedian = The Punisher. And Rorshack? All the guy had was a mask, a can of Aqua-Net, and a lighter.<br/><br/>Another tag-line is ""Based on the best selling comic book of all time."" Again, more BS. Everyone has heard of Batman, Spiderman and Superman too. Ask someone on the street who Ozymadeus is. Nobody knows, and it will stay this way.<br/><br/>This movie will be remembered as a disaster of a movie, worse then Daredevil and Elektra, except Watchmen had a bigger budget then the both of them combined.<br/><br/>The whole movie was a complete mess, based on an unimaginative story, filled with boring and easily forgotten characters, especially the Night Owl guy. That was the a main character of the movie, he had the most screen time, and the only thing the guy did was yell out ""Noooo"" when the Aqua-Net guy blew up, and that was in the commercial so you didn't even need to watch the movie to see the big conclusion.<br/><br/>THE END."
"C-Younkin","5","31","63","4 March 2009"," Great effects but plot lost in translation
","""Watchmen"" the book has been called one of the 100 best novels of all time. If that's the case then ""Watchmen"" the movie is missing a lot. I've not read the book but I've seen some of the art and from a technical stand-point director Zack Snyder and his team have done very well for themselves. Just the plot is lost in translation and it's one big 3 hour mess, a long and unpleasant string of flash-backs, subplots, exposition, bloody violence, and overall just a flat-out exhausting jumble of different things that never get a chance to breathe or work into any sort of entertaining narrative. It makes you wonder just how anyone thought Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's multi-layered graphic novel really could have ever worked on film? I was hoping to love this movie. Instead I wound up enjoying the Advil I took after it was over.<br/><br/>The time is 1985 and the soviets are about to attack within the U.S. It's 5 to midnight, which is like saying code level orange. Tricky Dick Nixon has been elected to a third term and, in the first of many flashbacks, we find that throughout current events between the 1940's-1980's regular human beings with no super powers have donned masks and costumes and become superheroes until Nixon forced retirement on them. When the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed, it effects the group in different ways. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is determined to uncover the murder, while Dan Dreiberg, formerly Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Laurie Jupiter, formerly Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) just seem content to live normal lives, and Ozymandias (Mathew Goode) has turned his hero status into financial gain by harnessing cleaner energy. Meanwhile, the only hero who actually has powers, Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup), is trying to divert the Soviet crisis while at the same time deal with rumors that his blue glow has caused his colleagues and several others to get cancer.<br/><br/>This is really only the set-up. From here it goes in different directions but still doesn't really add up to much. The script by David Hayter and Alex Tse is so backstory-crazy it makes ""Memento"" look linear, centering on everything from a controversy between the Comedian and Jupiter's mother (Carla Gugino), a stint between him and Manhattan in Vietnam, Manhattan's creation, a lot of childhood stuff with Rorschach and Jupiter, various scenes where these characters become disheartened or disillusioned, and a lot more. And when not in flashback, we're treated to everything from a character vacationing on mars and building some indescribable circular thing, Dan and Laurie having odd super hero fetish-sex, a prison riot, an irrelevant revelation about a character's father, and of course so much more. And then we have the actual action, which seems to come just as randomly as the rest of this movie and features every bloody thing from cheeks being bitten off, arms being chopped off, a meat cleaver taken to a guy's forehead, and unexciting slow-motion fights where arms, legs, and various other body parts are broken in two.<br/><br/>The movie spares nothing in regard to what's in the book but surrounded by all this bloat is some type of deep, mature point about heroism and humanity that just never comes through. The movie holds itself out as too serious and important. The constant shifting back and forth and from subplot to subplot, the scenes that just can't play out dramatically because they suffer from crammed explanations and characters who seem to just randomly come and go rather than feel apart of the movie just make this effort a bore. And what's worse is that most of these people are either just assholes or bland, monotonous, and cheesy and it makes it very hard to be anything but indifferent to them.<br/><br/>If anyone makes a jump to being somewhat interesting here it's Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach. He's a gruff-voiced bad-ass and I loved the character. The rest don't really make a dent, but Akerman and Crudup respectively increase the sexy by a lot. As does Zack Snyder. Like most comic book movies nowadays, he gives it a dark, seedy, grimy, and depressing look that complements the effects nicely. I thought the make-up, especially on Nixon, gave the movie a nice comic touch and Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan are each done beautifully, the former with his entrancing mask of moveable ink and Manhattan with his gorgeous blue electrical light and ability to duplicate, transport himself, and take things apart and put them back together just with a move of the hand. The Owl copter, the circular thing I described on mars, and the big ball of light that comes in the finale all look great as well.<br/><br/>This movie also has one of the best soundtracks probably ever put on one CD. Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"", Hendrix's ""All Along the Watchtower"", and the movie opens up with a Bob Dylan ""Times they are a Changin"" montage. In general this movie was just lost on me though. I have no idea where it was trying to go or what any of it means and to me it just looks like a nice-looking jumble of different things that just didn't work."
"raypdaley182","1","20","38","26 March 2009"," Too long and badly cut
","Like Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy and Alien 3 this film was in development hell for a very long time before an extended legal battle finally allowed its appearance on the silver screen. It may had made millions in both the US and UK box offices already but its still not a very good movie.<br/><br/>Based on an extremely obscure cult comic book series set in a parallel universe it catalogues the lives of a set of retired super heroes on a world where vigilante super heroes have now been outlawed after 40 years of service to their countries and their planet. Now someone is hunting them down and kills one then frames another for murder, the US is on the brink of Nuclear war with Russia (the movie is set in 1985 where Richard Nixon is serving his 3rd term in office) and the nuclear clock is set at 5 minutes to midnight.<br/><br/>The movie constantly moves forwards and backwards in time with no thought given to anyone who has never read the comics or knows nothing about The Watchmen, characters aren't explained very well and one in particular is made to seem very ambiguous about not being a very good person (The Comedian who I actually thought was being played by Robert Downey Jr) as we see him assassinate JFK and help end the Vietnam war, he is also seen to kill American civilians in the 1970's civil unrest race riots and appears to be enjoying his work far too much.<br/><br/>With the constant movement in time you are never exactly sure who is who and what is going on, characters aren't given the chance to develop on screen much and your going to spend almost all of the over 2 and a half hours of the movies duration being extremely confused.<br/><br/>Confused and bored, as the very poorly explained plot (what little there actually is of it) is interspersed with fast action sequences almost immediately followed with long drawn out scenes full of very dull dialogue. Its very badly paced indeed, no thought seems to have given to how the movie should play out and it also seems to have not been cut at all. You get the feeling that what you are watching is everything the director filmed and nothing has been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The film does show characters like Dr Manhatten (at least you see how he gets his powers) developing a clean alternative to nuclear power & fossil fuels much to the chagrin of various captains of industry, this project is being funded and assisted by the 1st super heroes to ever reveal his real identity Adrian Veidt formerly known as Ozymandias.<br/><br/>The film has a few twists and turns which will catch non comic book fans off guard and ends with Russia & America uniting against a common enemy. I wont reveal who that is or any of the twists but if you can follow the film for any longer than 5 minutes at a time then your doing a lot better than I was.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing but considering the films budget was $150 million they darn well should be, sadly it seems all the money was squandered on effects and nothing went on a decent script or hiring someone to adapt the comic books to a format that the non comic book geek could easily understand.<br/><br/>Terry Gilliam said it best when he stated the idea of making Watchmen ""was unfilmable"" and that by ""Reducing the story to a two or two-and-a-half hour film seemed to me to take away the essence of what Watchmen is about."". When someone who made great almost unimaginable movies like 12 Monkeys, Brazil & Baron Munchausen tells you your concept is ""unfilmable"" then you should really listen to him.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a visual spectacle that is too long, badly cut, very badly paced & very badly adapted. More could be been done with Rorschachs narration which could have been utilised to explain the characters much better, also to have dropped the original Minutemen from the movie completely as their appearance just confuses the viewer as to who you are watching.<br/><br/>I guess if the movie is watched with brain disengaged most viewers will enjoy it on the action and effects alone but will get bored during the quiet moments and start to fidget way before it gets anywhere close to the closing titles. Cutting about 45 minutes out of the film would vastly improve its watchability and pacing, in its current form the nicest thing I can say is that it is bearable but only just. Personally I was left wishing for movies like Howard The Duck & Masters Of The Universe, thats how little I enjoyed this film."

"tukaima-2","5","27","54","7 March 2009"," With their best effort, an incoherent mess
","From a non-Watchmen fan point of view, I thought the movie bombed. My 7 other friends and I had all kinds of complains but we all agreed that it had not been a good time. The theater was deafly quiet when credits rolled.<br/><br/>For my part, I thought the whole movie was very inconsistent and disjointed. You have literally 3 distinct flavors of movie blended into one: John with his god-like superpower that inspires wonder and mysteriousness; Rorschach with his Sin-City like action and narration; and The Comedian, Dan & Lori with their good old beat-them-up actions kind of like the Batman (but to much lesser cinematography effect). It's unfortunate that I don't believe they belong to the same story very well, and the short amount of time allowed for this movie makes it even more suffocating as we're forced to just see a wee bit of each of them.<br/><br/>I disliked the story on the basis that it does not do these heroes justice. It appears the fans enjoyed them as they are true to the original. I ask what is the point of sticking to the original when you only have 2.45 hours. If there is no entertainment value and if the heroes don't shine on the screen, then why bother in the first place? There are more than one place in the movie where the story takes some very amateurish turns - like after the two lovebirds had their fun and decided, hey maybe we should go save Rorschach... with such lack of dramatic display. There were so many lousy scenes like this, that I eventually just lost interests in it and just wanted it to end.<br/><br/>As for the 'dark and intelligent' remark. It is unfortunate but compared to the other dark, complex and intelligent superhero movies that came out over the past few years, Watchmen doesn't look all that more special in any way. Maybe it would, but a lot has been lost in the delivery.<br/><br/>With the lack of a distinct flavor (a motif if you may say), the lack of an interesting story and failing on its own highlight of story, this movie really failed to deliver for me. It could have been a lot better."

","Disclaimer: 1) Read the novel 2) Pay attention 3) Avoid viewing with anyone that knows nothing about the Watchmen 4) Avoid viewing with anyone that doesn't like complex plots 5) Avoid viewing with someone who doesn't like graphic violence 6) It is LONG but for good reason<br/><br/>Pros: - Great cinematography and graphics - Respectably true to the source material - Rorschach is awesome - Acting (for the major character) matches what I expected<br/><br/>Cons: - Looses some people with so many plot elements happening and sometimes not in chronological order - Theater version will be worse that the DVD due to time constraints - Some ""slow"" parts but if you like the source material you wont mind as much - Could have been better if they didn't follow the exact timeline as the book rather than jumping around as much.<br/><br/>OK so I read the novel about 2 months before I saw this movie so everything was pretty fresh in my head... and in my opinion this movie represented the book very well considering how much content is jammed packed into the novel. For example... A good deal of the back story dealing with the minute-men was packaged into the opening credits; the issue with this is that I understood what I was seeing but an average viewer would miss the context. Think of it this way... this movie has trouble standing upright without instruction and the graphic novel provides the manual.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** One thing I though the movie captured rather well was the ""mood"" of the novel. I say this because I saw the movie with someone who hadn't read the novel... and they were shocked at parts like the Comedian shooting JFK and the pregnant girl. Granted those things we're horrible but thats the point; hes a ""hero"" and supposedly greater than everyone else yet is actually more evil - as opposed to most comic heroes that have small personality problems at most. Also, the representation of the popular characters were close if not exact to what I had visualized when I read the novel. Rorschach was perfect - voice, psychotic mood, mannerisms. Comedian and Night Owl II were right on, and Dr. Manhattan was just as emotionless/detached as I had hoped. The rest I don't care as much about.<br/><br/>Another note, I actually like the ending of the movie better than the book. A) the movie ending better facilitated the plot's translation to the screen. Given some giant squid thing would have seem out of place related to the rest of the movie material. B) The movie ending had the same effect as the novel ending. Plus it offered a more reasonable future for Dr. Manhattan.<br/><br/>-AX"
"electric_marc","1","33","68","7 March 2009"," Completely and utterly disappointing
","I am not going to write a full-blown essay on this film--frankly, it doesn't deserve one. Yes, the visual effects are good and yes, the cinematography is... well, good. But so what. The acting was pitiful, the costumes were hokey, the fight scenes were contrived, and there seemed to be violence for the sake of violence. The bottom line is that there isn't a good story and certainly not a compelling message that'll leave audiences with a reason to see the movie again. For all the fans of the graphic novel, I'm sure you'll disagree. That's fine, you obviously enjoy the theme of the story. But I can tell you right now, for non-fans that are new to the ""Watchmen"" story, they'll be disappointed and won't see the movie again. And that really is a shame because director Zack Snyder did really well with ""300"" and he should be proud of his directing abilities. It also helped tremendously that he had a great story to work with that resonated with people. It's no coincidence ""300"" grossed over $300 million worldwide. Unfortunately, ""Watchmen"" doesn't have the luxury of a great story/message and its box office numbers WILL suffer for it."
"crosslouis","8","38","80","23 February 2009"," A Mixed Bag
","I'm a huge fan of Watchmen and after months of anticipation, I came out of the theater with reservations but an overall positive reaction to the film. Zack Snyder did an good job in adapting the unfilmable graphic novel.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley stole the show as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson did a great job as Nite Owl, Billy Crudup and Jeffrey Dean Morgan also relished their performances, Malin Akerman and Carla Gugino gave flawed performances and Matthew Goode did a good job as The World's Smartest man. The Opening sequence was a dazzling cinematic experience i'll never forget, the soundtrack was filled with great songs, although some didn't fit.<br/><br/>My problem with Watchmen is that Zack Snyder left out several scenes from the graphic novel, as well as minor characters, who had pivotal roles in the comics. Also, The Minutemen, the heroes in the generation before the film hardly had any screen time. Also, The Comedian's role was minimised significantly. The changed ending fitted much better than that of the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Watchmen is no where near as good as it's source material but considering the high expectations and the years of anticipation, Watchmen is a valiant effort."
"diac228","4","26","52","6 March 2009"," A tough pill to swallow, Watchmen will have you choking and gasping for air as the third act rolls around.
","In any sort of entertainment, you need to finish strong. Your song, speech, video game, movie, television show needs to finish out on top, wrap things up nicely---whether optimistically or pessimistically. Methods of entertainment can start slow, maybe even build slow, but should not, at any given moment finish slowly or in a weak matter. Watchman unfortunately fails to do this; and it's worse considering that the subject matter is such a highly-acclaimed one. While Watchman was a tough pill to swallow in the beginning and the middle, it becomes unbearably awful in the final act, and quite frankly demolishes any chance of this matching up to the comic book we so love.<br/><br/>Watchman is about a retired group of superheroes coming together after the murder of one of their own, The Comedian. With the silent investigation headed by Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), he reveals that the murder is part of something much bigger than just a random act of violence. In the meantime, the other superheroes are having a lot of trouble adapting to real life after their fame and fortune passed; while the United States is inches away from nuclear war. The themes explored here and unlike that of the typical comic book fare; themes of fate, God, destiny, war, apocalypse, and sacrifice are crucial to the entire plot and throughout the film remain a hot topic. David Hayter and Alex Tse had the tough job of being able to translate the massive comic book into film within a suitable running time.<br/><br/>Let's at least praise the effects. While a blue male bearing it all dozens of times isn't exactly to my liking, the special effects in Watchmen are indeed quite spectacular. While it lacks the visual style and edge of 300 or Sin City, they remain a sight to see. The highly stylized fights aren't as lengthy as Zack Snyder's previous comic adaptation, but are still fun to watch. The hits, strikes, and beatdowns are especially gruesome, cringe-worthy in some instances. Zack Snyder knows what keeps his audience riveted and sprinkles a few nasty fights from time to time to keep us on our toes.<br/><br/>The acting itself is grand as well, especially that of Jackie Earle Haley, who plays Rorschach. Not only is his character the best fleshed-out character, but also is the one that steals the spotlight the most with good delivery, funny one-liners, and more raw emotion than any other actor and actress on screen. Everyone else did a respectable job, although some of the extras are laughable when they shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Watchmen's downfall is definitely the complexity of it all. While a complex story is riveting most of the time, you must be able to guide the audience in a certain direction so that it doesn't look like the film is suffering a seizure and is mixing up the chronological order like shuffling of cards. The pacing of the film is extremely slow, and likes to reach into the past without giving you a hintage of warning. It becomes lingering and even annoying at times, although it does develop the main characters a bit more. The pacing is uneven because quick-paced fights are blending in with the slow scenes of excessive dialogue, backstory, and character progress. With the exception of Rorschach, there is little to care about, we don't feel much of a connection with the characters. Snyder did a decent job explaining a lot in a few moments (See the opening credits) but then adds unnecessary scenes and elongated scenes.<br/><br/>Then comes the third act. The entire film falls apart like a bad game of Jenga. The pacing totally grinds into a halt, the ending comes much too slowly, nothing is explained, no emotions will come out of you, there are unnecessary fights, and quite frankly we the audience just flat-out stopped caring for anyone. Literally, you'd have to have extensive knowledge of the comic book in order to have a better appreciation of the whole body of work itself. However, it's a flaw for us as an audience to have to do research in order to receive full enjoyment out of a film. People started walking out of the theater, people start squirming more in their seats, and as the credits rolled, silence filled the cinema.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: In order to watch the Watchmen and actually care, you must read Watchmen. It sounds very obvious, but The Dark Knight is a well-accepted and loved film, and I can guarantee you that most of the viewers hadn't honesty read a Batman comic book. The difference is we cared for Batman and his companions. In this case, we honestly don't, because they tried explaining so much, and chose the wrong things to explainleading to characters with weak and little development, unnecessary scenes, and a lack of connection with our heroes. The themes are explored but not fully fleshed out, the plot itself is accurate but also lacks a true interpretation, and the final act just damages the entire film.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has the energy to make comic books scream to life with entertainment (as proved in 300) but just didn't end Watchmen well at all. The ending may alienate some, but will frustrate more. 150+ minutes is long enough, no need to make it worse by dragging it by its knuckles. Beware of slow pacing and a very convoluted, complicated plot that will require previous knowledge, multiple viewings, and lot of patience.<br/><br/>Then a tolerance for disappointment."

","Guys this film isn't fantastic. A lot of my favourite dialogue from the comic was cut, and some of my favourite scenes as well.<br/><br/>the ending is that Veidt has been working with Doc Man to create a renewable source of energy to stop the conflict (or so everyone thinks) when really hes just building a machine that simulates Manhattans powers to blow up new york, pinning it on him.<br/><br/>and they changed a lot of the spirit of the comic, for example there's a long unnecessary fight scene at the end between Veidt and Rorschach and Nite Owl, totally unnecessary and obviously added to dumb the film down for more audiences.<br/><br/>and as well as that some characters are down played significantly or even taken out entirely. for example, the new york news vendor doesn't have a single line and the psychiatrist subplot is cut, and only one meeting with Rorschach is shown at all.<br/><br/>Saying that, the action was good, the CGI was incredible, and some scenes were hugely entertaining. A good overall film, but a disappointing adaptation in my opinion.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has done incredible to stay so faithful to the original comic, but the tone it takes is different to how i interpreted the comic and the themes have been changed significantly.<br/><br/>I appreciate this film, but I don't think I will be watching the watchmen again anytime soon. :P Sorry if I seem cynical, I stress that I was thoroughly entertained throughout this film, but don't go in with high expectations, because its impossible to adapt such a perfect piece of art."
"Field78","9","12","21","24 January 2012"," Cynical mirror to the world in a dazzling visual style (for those with patience)
","In 7 years, director Zack Snyder has proved himself as a director who can deliver entertainment that meets the expectations of modern audiences in terms of pacing and spectacle, without making compromises to decent scripting or performances from his cast. Granted, his 'Sucker Punch' may not share the sophistication of his former work (and I still haven't tried 'Legend of the Guardians'; owls speaking in British accents almost screams 'Monty Python' to me), but every great director has a dream project waiting to get made after a firm reputation has been established, and it can leave us either in awe (Inception!!), or wondering ""what the hell was he thinking?"" (but even 'Showgirls' had its merits). Having thoroughly enjoyed the inspired carnage of 'Dawn of the Dead', and '300', I really consider 'Watchmen' to be Snyder's Mona Lisa.<br/><br/>I never read the novel, but I know that Watchmen is dear to a lot of people, that many thought it was unfilmable, and many were convinced it was unfilmable after seeing the result. I guess it is understandable that a story of such thematic and character-driven complexity would be narratively overwhelming, yet disappointing as an action movie for those superhero junkies expecting something like ""300 X-Men"". There is always a pitfall when one wants to combine jolly good popcorn-fun with sincere drama. An uneven mix is what made 'Hulk' fall flat on its face. However, Christopher Nolan showed with 'The Dark Knight' that a comic book adaptation can be a genre movie transcending that very description. Snyder goes a step further: this is a work of art, subtly and carefully laden with symbolism, metaphor, tales of morality, allegory and even satire, blended into an exiting mix of doomsday thriller, stylish detective drama and superhero movie. 'Watchmen' asks a lot from its viewers, dissects human nature to its core. Is mankind evil? Can we be saved from ourselves? Are we even worth saving? Ambitious, certainly, and a recipe for disaster, were it not for an excellent script from (amongst others) X-Men's David Hayter, that shows us a parody of our world, on the edge of moral and physical destruction. There is no Good or Bad, only Bad and Worse. In an ideal world, superheroes would represent the best traits of mankind; in this world, the heroes are so messed up that they are hardly distinguishable from the bad guys they used to fight. The people don't even want them anymore, needing no reminder that each society gets the heroes it deserves. But the flawed vigilantes merely embody what is right and wrong in humanity itself: Rorschach is cynical and has lost all hope for mankind, yet he refuses to give in to apathy; Ozymandias seems genuinely willing to make the world better, but himself most of all; Nite Owl is honorable, but lacks drive and initiative; the Comedian, who sees mankind's black soul, and decides to be just a bit darker; and Dr Manhattan, a man of logic, who can only see the world in its physical proportions, making him all-powerful, yet without any passion or love for his fellow men. Together they are confronted with a world on the verge of annihilation as the Cold War moves closer to Armageddon. Is it in our nature to destroy ourselves? Or do we still possess the strength and will to survive? At what cost? <br/><br/>It is a rare thing these days that a director takes ample time to let this story unfold, and that he gives each player a thorough background and motivation. Lesser directors might have put Dr Manhattan's origin story in a montage during the opening credits; yet Snyder creates a wonderfully effective comic book collage that brings us up to speed on the alternative history of this universe, and allows Dr Manhattan almost a subplot worth of time to show why he is who he is. One of my friends who didn't like the movie labeled the scene where Dan and Laurie beat up a couple of thugs in an alley as unnecessary action. I knew I didn't agree, but it forced me look again, and notice that those shots are inter-cut with Dr Manhattan's interview, in which he is accused of being a danger; his detachment from humanity becomes painfully clear, as he claims that there is no difference between a living person and a corpse. Just as the fight scene suggests that Laurie and Dan went into that alley knowing full well it could lead to trouble; they seem to relish the violence they can unleash, and savor the felling of excitement that even culminates into sex, making all the more apparent that these heroes are far out of touch with the human world.<br/><br/>The world of the comic book is wonderfully captured, and both classical and contemporary music is used to great effect to enhance the feeling of a world that is drifting towards Armageddon. Yes, the movie is long, complex, pompous and slow, but it is well worth it that the viewer is completely immersed in the setting, and the characters are firmly established, since character-driven action plays a major part in the finale. It is also one of the reasons why the ending, although bleak, plays out so satisfying, both narratively and emotionally, and in line with the overall tone of the movie.<br/><br/>I see an interesting parallel with 'Blade Runner', a movie also under-appreciated as slow and simplistic by many in its time, but multiple viewings allowed its audience to peel away all the layers and absorb the complex matter it represented. 'Watchmen' already faired way better at its release, but I still hope that doubters will give it a second chance, and that it might make its way back into the IMDb Top 250 one day again."

","I can't remember the last time I watched such a thoroughly stunning visual treat on a big screen. I think this is possibly the most authentic realisation of a graphic novel I've seen. Each scene is framed like a panel in a comic, and the viewer is allowed ample time to drink in the superb visual construction of the piece.<br/><br/>Sadly, the time this takes makes for a movie far too long, with not enough actually happening, to be enjoyed. The main plot line is fairly thin, and is stretched to the point that I actually forgot about it half way through. The dialogue (Rorschach aside)lacks sparkle, as do the performances (again Rorschach aside - Jackie Earle Haley is to be commended for his performance), whilst the extensive flashbacks used throughout only serve to disrupt the narrative flow and make for an often confusing viewing experience. There's enough here to make me want to revisit the book, but I doubt it will make it to the DVD collection. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this - but unfortunately I was so bored by the end of it that I just wanted to leave. How disappointing."

","* Note: Yes, I read the graphic novel; no, I do not consider it perfection. This is not a biased Watchmen-comic fanboy review, nor a review from someone unappreciative of the original story.<br/><br/>Adoptions and remakes are always severely patronized. When we view them, we always have an image of the original version laced in gold in the back of our heads, with the label of PERFECTION hanging over that image. When someone interprets that original version of a story into another field of art, or reinterprets it into the same field of art, we go in unconsciously thinking that there is NO WAY it will affect us as powerfully as the original did. This alone is stupid. If you look at past novel-to-film adoptions, a lot of them have far surpassed the original text. The biggest example is A Clockwork Orange. The original novel was just another cliché the-government-is-evil novel with a cute spin on morality tied into the ending. The film, however, nearly single-handedly created the surrealist genre in cinema and minimized a lot of the cliché plot points. Just because a movie is based on a novel does not mean it has to be bad. However, if there is a flaw in the reinterpretation, we say it's the loss of the translation, but we never stop and accuse the original version of that flaw, even if that's where the flaw originated. Viola, Watchmen.<br/><br/>If there is anything the film version of Watchmen does, it shows the gaping flaws in the original graphic novel. Zack Snyder is taking a lot of critical trashingsome of which he deservesfrom the group of people who saw their nostalgic childhood memories/fantasies torn apart on the movie screen. But what that group of people fail to realize is that Snyder didn't change . . . well, anything at all, except the ending. He left out trivial scenes and bits of dialogue for the sake of time, but he pretty much copy/pasted everything in the graphic novel to the screen. That's something that can be proved on close examination of the two works. So there are only two reasons for people to dislike this movie: the actual story from the graphic novel, and the modern visual presentation.<br/><br/>As I stated earlier, a lot of negative reviews from the fanboys are (correctly) trashing their beloved graphic novel without even realizing it. The biggest problem that is obvious in both the film and novel is that the underline story of the Watchmen is just seen-this-before. The graphic novel wasn't unoriginal in the sense than you could predict every plot point, but it was unoriginal in the sense that when you look back, you see how typical the grand picture is. In both movie and novel, the ending is the cheesy and predicable reversal-of-expectations that has been done for hundreds of years. It's something you expect from a 5th grade creative writing session, not something from a said-to-be literary genius like Alan Moore. A lot of other plot points were directly ripped-off of Twilight Zone and Outer Limits episodes. Even the so-called ""deep"" themes are just clichés. You've heard them all before in high school psychology class. We understand the world is a bad place. We've understood it when we were 4-years-old and our grandmothers got ran over by a semi. Yet Moore carries his writing as if he's saying something completely new. Furthermore, the graphic novel and movie both reek of blatant immaturity. 1000-foot blue penises. Some of the most laughable costume choices ever drawn. The immature idea that something has to be laced with violence and sex or it isn't a mature piece of art. All the movie did was bring these flaws to the screen and expose them. These aren't Snyder's flaws, these are Moore's.<br/><br/>Now for Snyder. First and foremost, Watchmen should have never been entrusted to him. Period. Watchmen should have been treated like The Godfather. Instead, it got the treatment of the Spider-Man 3 outtakes. As a visionary director, Snyder is perfect when he's working on movies like 300. He has an infinite amount of talent with brining style and freshness to generic action scenes that you've literally seen thousands of times. This is why 300 worked so well. 300 was a pointless action movie, and it never tried to be anything else. Watchmen is the equal opposite. The heavy themes or nihilism and pessimism are almost made laughable in the film version of Watchmen. It's as if Snyder couldn't decide if he wanted to be a pretentious old man or a crowd-pleasing hack. And he isn't experienced enough or talented enough to attempt both at the same time. Also, his overuse of CGI literally turns entire portions of the film into a bad Disney Channel cartoon. This is partly due to Moore's immaturity, but Snyder's CGI just emphasizes it to the point I felt like I was watching Horton Hears a Who more than once.<br/><br/>As for the level of violence and sex: both were mild. The reason I mention it is because so many reviews are complaining about generic gore scenes, or a single breast shot, which I find downright funny. The average T-rated (13+) video game has more blood/violence than Watchmen^4. I can name several PG-rated films with more nudity. Grow up, folks.<br/><br/>Every factor I just listed is why Watchmen fails as a movie, and is underwhelming as a novel. The movie does absolutely nothing but rip open the mild bleeding wounds the novel had. It dumbs down an already semi-unoriginal story. It takes the boring dialogue scenes in the novel and turns them tedious and impossible-to-sit-through. It takes the downplayed childish elements in the novel and parades them in front of the camera. It turns the stylish art direction of the novel into a cheap live-action cartoon.<br/><br/>The Watchmen underwhelmed me in the first place. Now I just sit and laugh at them. Again: Grow up, folks.<br/><br/>2/10"

","Well just finished watching the DVD of this film and it's two o clock in the morning (put it on at eleven). My girlfriend fell asleep half way through and went quite rightly to bed, I on the other hand stayed up to see what was taking so long to happen in this movie (""big mistake""). I've watched thousands of films in my life and this one ranks down there with the worst of them. The first thing that started to annoy me was all the flashback scenes, so many you will start to get confused at points (and what was the point in most of them anyway). Next to annoy was the cardboard acting, no real feeling in or for the any of the lifeless characters. By this time a good portion of film had passed and nothing much had happened to arouse my interest, I kept thinking something big might be just around the corner but it never was unfortunately. Probably the biggest bummer for me was the ludicrous storyline (if you could call it that). You could liken it to a parallel universe of the united states of America (ridiculous). Then comes the big ending ""what a disappointment"", or it might have been had the rest of the film not sucked. 2/10"

","Unfortunately I have to argue that it doesn't deserve all the attention. Now I LOVE the Watchmen comic book. It is a piece of literature that should be treasured like most classics.<br/><br/>Honestly, going into it I thought this movie would result in one of two ends. Train Wreck or Eternal Glory. The Outcome. This movie is a train whose journey to eternal glory was cut short due to a lack of key locomotive parts. But not a wreck.<br/><br/>Seeing the story play out on screen was exciting and frustrating. Witnessing all the missing elements of the book was too much distraction, keeping me away from feeling fulfilled. Others in my group, new to the story, felt it was confusing. Not having enough emphasis on transitions between past and present. Though it does have some stunning visuals, and wild (although unnecessarily brutal) action that OD'ed on slo-mo. Personally, this movie seems like an audience pleaser. Like they took the most stirring, emotional comic book tale and numbed it down enough to give people something to clap at. This is evident when (readers of the book will notice) the stories biggest events unfold with little emotional response. Like they were glossed over. Or witnessed from the window of a passing train. <br/><br/>Shame. Could have been Great.<br/><br/>2 Things HAVE to be said. The make-up and music are the WORST in cinematic history! The music is just inappropriate and awkward for the moments they are attached to. Surgically removing your connection to the film every time a tune strikes up. But the make-up. My God the awful make-up. So many people giggled at the ridiculous faces of Richard Nixon and the elder Silk Spectre. Almost as many as those giggling at Dr. Manhattan's glowing blue... well you'll see. Everybody will see it no matter what the movie deserves. You can't fight the inevitable hype. Right now People are too excited, and they WANT this movie to be good so much they won't invest any stock in the bad reviews. Otherwise we wouldn't ever have to suffer through a Transformers 2.<br/><br/>I once thought Alan Moore was crazy for not wanting anyone to interpret his work into movie form. I saw From Hell, thought nothing of it. Saw the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and thought, ""Yea, they should leave his stuff alone."" Then V for Vendetta and I switched sides, ""Maybe it can be done."" Now with Watchmen, just respect the mans wishes and don't mess up his stuff. Its too intricate, and too precise for it to be diluted with someone else's interpretation."

Ultra violence is added where it is unneeded, yet it is removed in the one scene where it was essential to the story and message.<br/><br/>I read the comic rather recently and found it quite good, but unlike so many I didn't fall in love with it.

","I love the comic more than any comic or book I have ever read.

But its finally been done by none other then Zach Snyder, the genius behind 300. <br/><br/>So let me start by saying, it is the most stunningly beautiful film you will ever see. The cinematography alone is beyond anything previously made. As for the movie, it pays perfect homage to the graphic novel, taking the material and changing it just enough to work with film. Looking at the source however, I'm truly surprised it came out so good and am certain it will offend quite a number of people for its gore and content.<br/><br/>I watched it in Imax on the night of it's release, 12:00 in the morning and walked out of the cinema 3 hours later breathing the night's air and wishing it wasn't over. This is not a movie for idiots, superhero fan's, or people looking for a simple plot. This is a movie for someone looking for a rich and deep portrayal of humans, with an added dose of violence to appease your dark side. And for what it is no one could have done better. Also I agree with Zach, I hope Alan Moore will one day watch it, he'll realize it does justice to his comic.... <br/><br/>So in closing I urge you to watch the Watchmen, you will not be disappointed."

"moviefilmsdirectory","7","5","7","16 March 2019"," Watchmen
","Watchmen is a 2009 film Directed by Zack Snyder, based upon the extremely popular and influential comic book series and later graphic novel: Watchmen by Alan Moore. Watchmen gives a revisionist look at the comic book superhero, while also dealing with dark themes of human nature and morality. The source material, Watchmen, was deemed by many to be un-filmable, not only due to the production issues that plagued the project, but also due to the non-linear telling of the narrative. The film had been in production for twenty years, going through different drafts and scripts. Eventually Zack Snyder was brought on board and he attempted to remain faithful to the book as he could. There were two director cuts release, but I will only be reviewing the theatrical cut.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a now separated superhero team called the Watchmen, in a parallel universe set in the 1980's. The six former members of the team were The Comedian, Dr. Manhattan, Silk Spectre, Nite Owl, Ozymandias and Rorschach. Following the death of one of its members Rorschach, begins an investigation to find the killer. However the other members are more preoccupied with a bigger problem, threat of nuclear war.<br/><br/>Snyder gives the film a distinct style, drawing on a grey tinted colour pallet, giving the film a Neo-Noir style. Technically the film is visually stimulating with interesting images and frames. The soundtrack for the film captures the mood almost perfectly for each scene, with the exception of the cover of Hallelujah played in the film.<br/><br/>Unlike most superhero comics, Watchmen does not focus on action too much. Snyder decided to rectify this, adding in fight scenes and more gruesome violence. While I am not particularly against violence in films, but I found that the addition of these scenes did little for narration purposes, did not make the film any more enjoyable and detracted from the overall experience. It also prevented a lower age rating and wider appeal. Another artistic liberty Snyder took was to give all the watchmen superhero strength.<br/><br/>Consequentially the film becomes less real, and you never fear for the Watchmen as much as you probably should. It is interesting to compare this choice to Christopher Nolan's Batman films, where Nolan tried to make the characters as humanly realistic as possible. Nolan's Batman films also have their fair share of violence, which show the harsh reality of the world of Batman. The violence in these films while often very physiologically jarring, was extremely effective and added to the narrative. In Watchmen they are exploitive and often pointless.<br/><br/>The films ending also had to be made bigger than that of its comic book counterpart. Unfortunately the ending is not very satisfying, and at a nearly two and half hour run time, is disappointing in its abruptness and somewhat stupidity. Finally the film also contains a strange and awkward sex scene, which somewhat takes away from the overall feel of the film.<br/><br/>The actors give a normal performance in their roles, but nothing outstanding. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian probably gave the best performances in the film, with both characters displayed as unhinged, violent, sociopaths. Billy Crudup gives a mediocre performance as Dr. Manhattan, with a voice that sounds abnormal and uninterested. While this suits the character, it does not work overall and sounds like bad acting. The character himself is all powerful being able to manipulate and control all matter. It is then frustrating to see the character murder people rather than just, make their weapons disappear or teleport these people to a different location. In the film Dr. Manhattan displays the ability to do so. While he does experience a crisis of humanity, with all matter being the same to him, the film does not explain why he would fight these people then. Presumably if all matter is the same than it would not be easier to disarm these people rather than straight up blow them up? He is also shown to have lost his humanity from the moment he received his superpowers. He is left underdeveloped, or perhaps more unexplained in this film. The film also contains a terrible Richard Nixon look-alike, but that does not really effect the film overall.<br/><br/>The film is by no means a terrible film. The plot is interesting up to a point, and like I previously mentioned the visuals are very distinct and iconic. The film contains a good sound track and overall average acting. It possess interesting themes and messages, and is a must see for any fan of superhero films. The film negative qualities include mainly its unfulfilling plot, an average script and some underdevelopment.<br/><br/>For me, the film is a 6.5/7 out of Ten."
"godhatesharper","5","5","7","10 June 2017"," Mediocre film that never quite catches true essence of comic
","Full disclosure: I have indeed read the graphic novel and I LOVED it. It really makes you think about the true nature of humankind and makes you ponder the true breadth of the moral scale, while being a subtle and clever parody of superhero comics (while still showing an obvious respect for them). Yes, fanboys do treat it like an infallible masterpiece of religious stature; I don't agree with that. but, it is still most definitely a thought-provoking read that will stick with you for ages. The movie adaptation on the other hand? Um...well, at least the cinematography is nice. Zack Snyder definitely got the look of the book right, and it managed to perfectly capture that Cold War tension and hostility. But everything else just seems to fall...flat. I had high hopes for this movie based on fan reviews, but I really think their bias and knowledge of these characters clouds their judgment. The only character I can say was properly developed here compared to the novel is Rorschach (in an excellent performance by Haley), but his presence just seems pushed aside to make room for Silk Spectre and Dreiberg in some TERRIBLY lazy (at best) performances by Akerman and Wilson. The Comedian was good, although I wish Snyder actually adhered more closely to the book in that regard and used him more sparingly. Dr Manhattan was pretty much what I expected, but his monotone diatribes came off as less godlike and more just plain creepy. Veidt's role was more amped up here, and the actor just does not capture the character's ambiguity at all. I definitely feel like someone who was going into this blind could tell immediately that something more sinister was behind him. The first ten minutes were the most stunning. They actually did manage to perfectly capture the exposition of the novel and the historical context behind it. But all in all, Watchmen just can't capture the complexity of the original. The characters are flat, the symbolism is gone, and we're stuck with a plodding storyline that just leaves you bored more than anything. Pros: Contrary to popular opinion, I actually did like the CGI in this film. Rorschach is perfect. The comedian is also pretty good. Cons: Silk Spectre is probably one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. Excessive runtime. The action, the dialogue, the pace, somehow literally almost everything seems to appear flat here. Conclusion: Yes, Watchmen looks almost exactly like the comic, but it lacks the literary elements that make it such a compelling story."

Dr. Manhattan was cardboard and robotic, OK - I get that he's nuclear-powered and all but his acting was dreck. The only character that really ""sold it"" in my opinion was the bad guy...I'm not going to say who since that might spoil it for others who read this and may still have 3 hours of their lives that they don't care about wasting. Oh, and Rorschach and a few smaller characters were OK too, but not ""special"" enough to make the whole movie great. The naked love scenes did not really add to the story, but I guess the teenage boys love those. Since I'm home with a cold and didn't feel like getting up to put in a DVD I was stuck with this, and now I wish I had gotten up and put on a DVD of something else.

Watchmen is now among that very exclusive list.<br/><br/>This movie was so bad, the entire time I was envisioning watching it from the peanut gallery of Mystery Science Theater 3000. <br/><br/>Two hours into the movie, neither of us had a clue what was going on or what the plot was. Let's see...there was a tall, creepy blue guy who appeared naked in half of his scenes, and wore a banana hammock the other half. A few random sex scenes that I might have simply fast-forwarded to had this been an evening alone with the DVD player. A few decent action scenes that I wanted to revel in, but couldn't, because I didn't care about the outcome of the action. Leaving the movie at that point was exiting the stock market after it has already taken a dive -- disappointing, but better to realize a loss than wait for it to hit bottom.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I have not read (or even heard of) the comic book -- and I shouldn't have to. A movie should have at least SOME standalone entertainment value, regardless of what it was adapted from."
"Perception_de_Ambiguity","9","24","49","11 March 2009"," Despite a major issue, I enjoy it spectacularly
","I feel that plot structuring isn't one of the movie's strengths. Nothing is emphasized through appropriate cinematic language. Such as giving more running time to what is relevant to the plot, and less to what is just an enjoyable subplot. Or using a musical score to give the scenes a certain place in the movie, rather than letting every individual scene have maximum impact. It is just scene after scene after scene, without giving a sense of where it is heading at or what it wants to say.<br/><br/>Obviously the filmmakers wanted to keep as much from the original source as possible, while also staying as true to every little drawn image as possible. Here I have to agree with the popular criticism, this is just not how turning a comic book into an epic movie works. Now this didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie, but here it clearly failed in a department in which I think no good genre picture should normally fail.<br/><br/>So for me this problem hinders the film from living up to its potential regarding the building of suspense. But why it still works for me is because I find each individual scene on its own to be tense. The sociological, scientific and philosophical ideas of the story speak so well to me that it holds my attention for the full running time and never makes me lose interest in what happens or what is going to happen.<br/><br/>At least the plot is adequately coherent and the characters consistent, so Zack Snyder hardly is a failure as a director, like some people suggest. Not to mention the visual effects, which apparently effortlessly were integrated into the story, and serve telling the story as well as making the film's visual style even possible. This to manage and make work, also takes considerable skill on the director's part.<br/><br/>It's an unusual story of epic proportions, with as epic visuals. I consider it to be a science fiction film, playing in an alternate universe and having a character like Dr. Manhattan. All the parts with Dr. Manhattan are also easily my favorite ones, because without him the story wouldn't be one of nearly such grand scale and his physical nature offers some welcome brain food concerning quantum mechanics, which is a highly unexplored subject in Sci-Fi cinema, by the way. Those are the main reasons why watching it was a great experience for me, in spite of my gripes."

","Admittedly, I know nothing about Watchmen. Is it a comic book series, is it a graphic novel? Are they good guys, are they bad guys? Do they have superpowers do they not? This movie was my first introduction to them and it wasn't a good introduction. I was confused within the first five minutes. The character The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was watching T.V. and he's watching a speech by Nixon at the president's podium, so immediately I'm thinking early 70's. Then he flips the channel to MTV which I know didn't hit the air until early 80's! But I thought: ""This will all be explained anyway."" Well, it wasn't.<br/><br/>The movie then dove into giving us a taste of each costumed caper. There was a group called the Minutemen who, I think, were predecessors to the Watchmen (if the Watchmen is even a group to begin with). What I did gather is that these masked men and women were not quite who you'd want protecting your streets from evil. The Comedian, for instance, was nothing more than a criminal in a mask. And why even give him the name ""The Comedian""? That's entirely too close to ""The Joker"", another wicked DC character.<br/><br/>Apparently, if you put on a costume you become super strong (like breaking concrete with your fist strong), you gain elite fighting skills, can dispatch of scores of foes without breaking a sweat, and can sustain the most gruesome beating without any visible signs of damage. OK, so you might be saying: ""Isn't that the case with all action movies nowadays?"" I say to that, yes, and I think it's absurd in all cases except when the action heroes have super powers.<br/><br/>We all know it's a precondition for a female superhero to be a supermodel. One of the superheroes named Silk Spectre 2 ((Malin Ackerman) she was number 2 because her mom was the first), besides the super ability to maybe cause drooling with her incredible lack of clothing, she was able to kick men clear across a room, break bones completely in half and best of all she never had a hair out of place. Now that is an ability to be jealous of. No matter what she did: fight, have sex, save people from a burning building-- her hair was never out of place. Now, her clothes... that's a different story. They were displaced a few times as this movie bordered on softcore porn.<br/><br/>Between Silk Spectre showing her goods and having a sex scene with Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) choosing to parade around with no clothes, there was plenty of nudity. I guess if you get atomized and reconstructed like Dr. Manhattan did you then prefer to let it all hang out. Why wear clothes when you're ripped like Mr. Universe and you can presumably make your body parts any size you like? <br/><br/>Let me not make it seem as though the movie was all bad. The last ten minutes were good. Which kind of sucks because the movie was so long. Two hours and 40 minutes or so to be exact. <br/><br/>So, lets do a brief recap: confusing, softcore porn, unexplained abilities, too long. This movie wasn't catered to the non-fanboys at all."

Watchmen is not your average superhero movie, but it tries to be more, only falls short... or actually long!<br/><br/>Watchmen is still a superhero movie, and it is still an adaptation, an adaptation that makes it look like the director was pulling his hair with every turn of the page. That was the impression i had all along this overlong feature.<br/><br/>Forget about transition in this movie, it does not exists. Snyder looks like he's gluing scenes together at one point.

Too preachy for my taste.<br/><br/>On the positive side, it keeps you wondering, when will it all stick... and it does at the end. In terms of fantasy, I can't say I'm amazed but it's O.K.<br/><br/>***SPOILER*** People are saying it's complex, I have to differ as complexity without substance is just complication. Dr. Manhattan, on the brink of nuclear war, goes into a mid-life crisis, his gf dumps him and guilt eats him up inside. So he forgets about earth an peace... and flies to Mars. So in order to have an ending, the Doctor had to fall into depression, hmmmm.<br/><br/>So overall, Watchmen is a miss, for curiosity purposes may be worth a watch."
"Lobo69","3","14","26","18 March 2009"," Never intended for mass audience consumption
","I think one of the most beautiful ironies in recent memory is how the Psychologist in Watchmen was driven insane by digging into Rorscarch's psyche, just as normal American families were driven insane because they went to Watchmen with their kids not knowing they were entering the mind of Alan Moore. Thats something that most people are not ready for/never will be ready for, and its the biggest reason a Watchmen movie could never work as a mass audience film especially when literally interpreted from the source. Alan Moore goes to dark places when he writes, he asks tough questions, and his writing is both shocking and disturbing on many levels, and it contains a whole lotta truth. If there is one thing the average person cannot handle and does not want ANY part of, its the truth, in any form, and especially not in their 'entertainment'.<br/><br/>There was no way Watchmen could ever be 'dumbed down' enough for it to appeal to a wide audience, thats not was it was ever intended to do. This movie is true to the book on some levels, it has truth, its dark and its disturbing. So why did Hollywood try and market it as just another super hero movie like the Dark Knight, as if to say it might be something you could take your kids to see? I have no idea, it is probably the biggest movie marketing blunder I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>This movie fails because it does not capture the essence of the characters, the only one it gets close to doing so with is Rorschach, (and you just know that Hollywood execs are right now trying to figure out a way to make a Rorschach prequel movie, PG rated of course.) But so little time is spent on character development for the rest of the characters that they come off as flat as a cardboard cutouts.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the movie is a disaster, but it doesn't do what the book did in terms of the way it made you think and feel, and isn't that the point? If they could not translate that to film, then the other alternative should have been considered which was to make the Watchmen into an ordinary superhero team and give them an adventure to go on like the Avengers or Justice League. Quite frankly, much as that would have been a bastardization of the source material, it would have been more entertaining than what we ended up with.<br/><br/>All the slo-mo action in the world could not smooth over the problems associated with a 'book to film' project like this, but I'm sure thats how Zack Snyder and co sold the idea to the big wigs. Only someone as young and inexperienced as Snyder could have the ego to think that making a movie like this and have it appeal to a wide audience was a realistic goal. I suspect he will be far more careful and 'Michael Bay' like in choosing his projects in the future."

It's brilliantly shot and executed, but it's not quite anything.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs/Rorschach was my favourite performance and thought his characterisation was the most compelling.<br/><br/>Once again one feels that the studios when they make something with this amount of SFX and cash pumped into it they want the maximum amount of screen time - But if someone would only knock this down to a 100 minutes it would possibly have been a very enjoyable film"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","7","11","28 April 2020"," Well worth watching the watchmen
","The graphic novel source material is a masterpiece, bold, uncompromising, subtle, witty, imaginative with very unique characters and an immersive world. Albeit one that is near-unfilmable, with the themes, the huge amount of content and the amount of depth needed, a three hour film sounded nowhere near enough on paper. Plus Zack Snyder is nowhere near close to being a favourite of mine, but saw 'Watchmen' anyway because of my love for the source material, that it looked fantastic and because the cast are very talented.<br/><br/>'Watchmen' really is well worth your time. More the director's cut though than the theatrical release, though both versions have the exact same brilliant qualities. Of which there are many in 'Watchmen'. It is a prime example of how to transcribe a graphic novel to film, while not being as good and not having everything there, and still be near-great on its own terms. It is by far Snyder's best film in my view, as well as being his most mature and ambitious, being the only one to be above good and be more than style over substance. His other films left me mixed to indifferent.<br/><br/>Is 'Watchmen' perfect? No. It does feature one of the most uncomfortable-feeling and pointless love scenes on film, and Leonard Cohen (well certainly for the song in question, it is a great song that is not well used) has never been used more awkwardly in visual media in my view (partly because in my opinion it doesn't fit with the context of the scene).<br/><br/>Matthew Goode is also a bit too stiff and subdued as Ozymandias. Actually do prefer Jeremy Irons' more eccentric and all out portrayal in the recent series, despite the character being a lot less puzzling here. So it is easy to see why 'Watchmen' is a divisive film, though more for its heavy, polarising themes, the huge length (that sounds overlong on paper), that figuring out what's going on admittedly is not easy for anybody who is not familiar with the graphic novel and it seems that the ending has left people divided (the ending in the source material sparks much debate as well).<br/><br/>For all of the flaws mentioned, so much works in 'Watchmen's' favour. It looks amazing for one thing. Very stylish and imaginative with some incredible special effects, there is nowhere near as much gratuitous slow-motion here than seen in some of Snyder's other work. The opening sequence is absolutely amazing in as jaw-dropping a way as you can get, what a way to start a film. The music is nostalgic and atmospheric, with mostly inspired use of great songs. Only the Cohen song in the scene in question is questionable. Snyder's direction is some of his most ambitious and doesn't try to do too much to the same extent as his other films.<br/><br/>Moreover, the script compels, flows naturally and raises interesting ideas that provokes thought, managing not to trivialise its difficult content. A good deal of talk but not too exposition-heavy, even when focused on Dr Manhattan in the middle act. There is not much subtlety here, Snyder and subtlety never belonged in the same sentence, but the ironic wit translates well to film from the graphic novel as does the maturity. The length is a long one, but the source material is massive so the film really needed to be long. If anything, in terms of adapting it would be better a mini-series. The story makes the most of getting one immersed in an authentically rendered world, and thematically it is bold and executed in an unforgivably uncompromising approach as ought. The violence shocks but didn't come over as gratuitous and the action thrills. Didn't have much of a problem with the ending, but can see why others would, the climax is thrillingly staged at least.<br/><br/>A good job is done with the characters, though Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias is underused and a bit underdeveloped. Night Owl and in particular Rorschach being the standouts, though The Comedian is also a difficult role to pull off. Apart from reservations with Goode, the performances are strong. Jackie Earle Haley is perfect casting as Rorschach, and have no qualms with Billy Crudup, Patrick Wilson and Jeffrey Dean Morgan either. The most difficult roles, pulled off beautifully.<br/><br/>Overall, very good and nearly great, with a lot done extremely well with a couple of misgivings. The polarisation is understandable but the appeal is even more so. The recent adaptation, despite getting a lot of over the top hate very prematurely into its run is also worth seeing. It is a slow starter and ends anti-climactically but there is so much brilliant about it, and if one sticks with it if put off by the first couple of episodes it to me and others got a lot better. 8/10"

"lepermessiahtr","1","23","47","2 April 2009"," What the Zack?
","This movie is a slap in the face for everybody who has read the comic book (which is genius by the way). Multiple critical points have been changed in this movie adaption which completely mutilate and deform the original story.<br/><br/>1. There are no ""Watchmen"". The masked heroes never refer to themselves as such. The movie strongly implies that the masked heroes formed a solid group called Watchmen, which is plain wrong. In fact you can see the scene where one of them tries to form a group and fails even in the movie.<br/><br/>2. Blaming the death of millions on Dr Manhattan in the end is completely ridiculous and unbelievable. The story is completely screwed up that way. No alliance of men can stop Jon, so there's no reason for peace. The ominous ""Nothing ever ends."" line by Jon is erased and shifted to Laurie (who does not! know what Jon would say, Jon is an enigma and nobody knows what he really thinks)<br/><br/>3. Rorschach doesn't speak like he is supposed to most of the time (which is enough to kill this movie for me without the other flaws), and the changes in his history/personality are made to make him look like more of a hero instead of the cold and pretty insane psycho he is in the comic. By the way, people speak other people's lines in this flick. You can tell what that does to characterization... it utterly screws it up!<br/><br/>4. The ending is plain wrong. Night Owl realized that Veigh was right in the comic, there is no cheeseburger with extra cheese ""Nooooo"" scream when Rorschach is killed and he doesn't beat up Veigh. Just horrible.<br/><br/>So, in summary, the original message and style of the comic is completely messed up, and when I realized after half of the movie this can't be saved, the rest was incredibly boring. Will not watch again, as the real Rorschach would say.<br/><br/>Of course, there is great attention to visual detail that can be commented on positively, but all in all this is a travesty and a disgrace.<br/><br/>Did I mention the terrible soundtrack?<br/><br/>Glad I didn't pay for it.<br/><br/>PS: I know this isn't a good review, but I'm just so angered by this trash I had to vent my anger.<br/><br/>PPS: passing this comment through the censorshit was unbelievably hard >:-("

","Against the consensus, but hey! First of all, let me begin by informing you all that I have not read the graphic novel. I have no prior knowledge of these characters, or the story. I deliberately ignored all reviews about the film, and kept an open mind as I do regularly.<br/><br/>I'll start with the acting. Wilson was reasonably convincing in the role of Dan, as was Morgan in the role of Eddie Blake. Both actors played their parts well, and convinced me that they were super heroes for the duration. One performance, however, stood out. A straight mile above the rest was Jackie Earle Haley in the role of Rorschach. His acting was astounding, and I felt an attachment to this character by the end of the film. It was the only performance I feel that deserves anything in the form of high praise.<br/><br/>I am the belief that the story was unsuitable for the big screen. It felt almost as random and pointless as 'The Spirit', and I was equally bored and bewildered throughout. I'm all for a far fetched story, but Dr Manhattan's back story, and character as a whole seemed on a par with that of a five year old's art-class project. The story failed to command my attention, and I was furious with the way it ended.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm sure this film is excellent if you're a fan of the graphic novel. However, be warnedÂ… If you've never read it before, you're in for a shock; and it probably won't be a good one."

Malin Akerman is beautiful to begin with, but was presented as about the most alluring character I have ever seen in a film. The sex scenes were very graphic, and showed the best and least-known benefit to being, and having sex with, a superhero.<br/><br/>The story line was incredibly complicated, but presented in a way that made it easy to follow without losing sight of the characters. The characters were deeply flawed, and their problems seemed so much more real than those of the X-Men or Batman, for example.<br/><br/>I'd recommend the film to anyone with a strong stomach who wants to leave the theater completely turned on."

"Elswet","9","18","36","10 March 2009"," Beautiful. Art-House Comic Book Gets Beautiful Cinematic Treatment.
","I was hesitant. The comic book is GENIUS. The movie will not be because the director and writers will either rewrite the thing to get it onto the screen, or be SO faithful as to render it moot, on screen. The sheer genius of the comic book makes it difficult, certainly, but to remain too faithful to the written word is typically the death knell to any visual work...except when the written word is a graphic novel (and/or comic book), it would seem.<br/><br/>The film is genius, but (as others have pointed out) it's the genius of the comic book this movie holds and NOT directorial genius. As closely as this follows the graphic serial, it must have been pretty easy to alter the direction of the narrative, watch the ques, and insert visuals as dictated by the source materials, which were kept there on the set and used like a Watchman ""Bible,"" according to news sources.<br/><br/>The angles, the colors, lighting, all contribute as much to the overall work as the performances and film quality, but this is exactly what the comics set as axiom wherein these elements are concerned. There are no surprises as to the cinematic adaptation. The surprise would have been a creative attempt at an actual adaptation. This is (not merely, mind you) the graphic novels translated to film, rather than an actual adaptation. <br/><br/>That all having been said, this is fantastic both fundamentally and in final execution! It is visceral, graphic, soulful, and visually stunning. But more importantly, it is beautiful, intellectual, and above all, human. Oh yes, it's the overall humanity of the work that renders it a must see, must experience, must HAVE film of the year.<br/><br/>This is amazing, and my expectations were already running pretty high. That's saying something.<br/><br/>On a parental note, however, this film features full male frontal nudity. It is done artistically and is a necessary and beautiful element of the film, but I thought there will be MANY parents out there who will not be expecting it.<br/><br/>It rates a solid 8.9/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"Muffinking526","10","18","36","9 March 2009"," People need to know what to expect going into it
","Okay, I am not going to provide a lengthy synopsis for this movie as it has been done 1000 times before and one more would likely bore readers to tears. I have a few quick points to make and then will be on my way, however, before I make them, I would like to say that I feel this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time (on my top ten, for sure). Okay, so here it is. I looked at a few comments people have made about this movie and those most common complaints I've seen are: <br/><br/>""It's a boring movie that has superheroes without superpowers. It does doesn't have enough action for a superhero movie."" <br/><br/>Okay, to better understand Watchmen is to understand that it is an extremely unconventional superhero movie, one that breaks the typical superhero stereotype. It is about normal people (spare Dr. Manhattan) who take it upon themselves to do what they can to protect society. It is not about characters who gain superhuman abilities through a run-in with some form of radiation (again, ignoring Dr. Manhattan); they are not meant to have super powers. And as far as a lack of action is concerned, while I disagree with that statement, it is important to note that the graphic novel and even the movie are described as a ""complex, multi-layered mystery."" If that doesn't give you a heads-up as to what it's going to be like, then I don't know what will. What else did you expect from a movie that labels itself in such a way? <br/><br/>""The costumes are hokey, lame, etc."" <br/><br/>That's because they are supposed to be. Again, these are normal people who decided to do what they can with what they've got. The costumes are realistic in the sense that normal people can't afford a billion dollar high-tech Batman suit complete with state-of-the-art flying apparatus and seemingly invincible armor. If people were to actually dress up and fight crime like superheroes, their costumes would look a heck of a lot more like the Watchmen's than Batman's or Spiderman's.<br/><br/>When you go to see Watchmen don't expect a Batman, Spiderman, Iron Man and so on because that's not what you're going to get. You're going to get just what it says you will, which is a ""complex, multi-layered mystery."" And if you know and expect that going into it, something tells me you're going to love it."

","Tonight I was fortunate to see a special press screening of 'Watchmen', just two days after the World Premiere and going in with low expectations, I am pleased to say that the film was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of the Moore and Gibbons comic series, but not a fan of director Zach Snyder's 'visionary' directorial style, I went into the film not expecting very much, but was pleased to find out that the Alan Moore dialogue was left mostly in tact, the Dave Gibbons' art was replicated beautifully on screen and Snyder's irritating use of slow motion in '300' was thankfully kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>Presuming that the majority of you reading this are familiar with the story, I shall skip the story and move straight on to the 'good, the bad and the ugly' of Watchmen.<br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>>The film is accurate to the source material about 90% of the time, which means that often you have dialogue and scenes lifted straight from book to screen, often which results in a wonderful familiarity.<br/><br/>>For a book that is strong because of the story and not necessarily the action, it is a relief to find that the acting is mostly great. The acting from Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach), Patrick Wilson (Nite Owl II), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian) are of a particularly high standard and the roles seem to have been made for each actor.<br/><br/>>I particularly loved the opening credits which showcase some of the subplots of the book, which including chronicling the deaths of Dollar Bill and The Silhouette and showing the group photo of the Minutemen.<br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/>>Nite Owl II calling their group of heroes the 'Watchmen'.<br/><br/>>The inappropriate use of certain songs at different moments. The use of 'Ride of the Valkyries', Hendrix's 'All Along the Watchtower' and Simon & Garfunkel's 'Sound of Silence' all seemed like it was descending into parody.<br/><br/>>The sex scene in the middle of the film which played like an outtake from 'Team America'...<br/><br/>>The changing of the plot towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>>Tyler Bates' bombastic score which seemed a little out of place...<br/><br/>The Ugly: <br/><br/>>Matthew Goode as Ozymandias was completely miscast. In the book, Ozymandias is strong, bulky and in many cases looks more heroic than most of the other 'masks', but in the film he seems weedy and snivelling and felt more like a low-grade Bond villain.<br/><br/>>My Chemical Romance's cover of Dylan's 'Desolation Row'.

"gaiusjulius","10","20","41","12 March 2009"," Simply sublime
","Saw it last night. I'm in love. I was extremely surprised as to how closely Zack Snyder stuck to the graphic novel. The film was practically oozing with layers-it was so dense and complex, moving away from the awesome but simplistic duality of The Dark Knight and into a complex, philosophical, morally ambiguous epic. It was a visual and aural feast-the film just washed over me, and I sat there aghast at its awesomeness. The music choices were epic, with some fantastic period pieces which, although cheesy at times, were just so fantastically chosen. The visuals can in no way be faulted-everything, from the dark, dreary pre-Armageddon New York, to the red planet, to a glowing blue man with everything hanging out, it was simply stunning. There were so many fan easter eggs (copies of Under the Hood scattered around, the newspaper man, who is apparently in the director's cut, Nostalgia advert playing in the background).<br/><br/>I think I have two gripes with the film: exaggeration of the abilities of the characters, and the altered ending. I won't go into the second in much detail, but I still prefer the giant squid. In terms of the characters, they all seemed to have super-human strength and agility, which doesn't seem right-these guys are just strong, masked vigilantes. They are not Spider-man or similar. (Think Batman for their abilities).<br/><br/>But, the characterisation was SPOT ON (apart from Silk Spectre. Rubbish actress). Nite Owl, played superbly by Patrick Wilson, was a joy; his awkwardness and sexual impotence translated perfectly onto the screen.<br/><br/>Dr Manhattan I felt had the most exposition and it really helped the film, I think. When he was so brutally transformed into a God, I literally gasped.<br/><br/>Ozymandias I think was the weakest (after silk spectre). His character from the beginning was less ""all-american hero"" and more ""maniacal villain"". The actor tried his best, but he was playing him all wrong. The point of the film is that it's supposed to be a surprise when we find out he's behind it all, because he was such a nice guy, an intelligent guy, a pacifist, a vegetarian etc. He was a hero, for pete's sake, he shouldn't be doing those things! But from the very beginning he was played as a megalomaniac, intent on dominating the world. If you hadn't picked up that he was the baddie by around the half way point, then his little Alexander the Great speech certainly revealed things (should have left that till we knew the truth...).<br/><br/>The Comedian was perfect really. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is the Comedian, no doubt about that. Nothing else to say really.<br/><br/>Rorschach. Well, what can I say? Simply sublime. Patrick Earle Haley inhabited the role so perfectly it was frightening-I really felt that he was a psychopathic vigilante, dispensing his own brand of justice based on his own warped moral code. He completely stole the show, dominating every scene he was in. His journals, with fantastic voice-over straight from the pages of the book, tied the whole film together extremely well. I really felt for him as a character and, along with Dr Manhattan, definitely was the most fleshed out. When he said those infamous lines ""Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon"", I did a little ""Whoop!"" in my head. Then, when he was killed by Manhattan, I literally cried. His almost silent ""Do it"", followed by a harrowing scream sent shivers down my spine, and Nite Owl's emotional response made the whole moment so emotional (good idea having him there-very effective).<br/><br/>As you can tell, I love this film. Along with V for Vendetta and The Dark Knight, my favourite comic book adaptation ever, and definitely one of my favourite films of all time. I could talk about this film for days, but I've decided to keep it relatively brief Now go and see it, then buy the book, read it, then see it again, then buy the DVD, watch it, then read the book. Then watch the DVD with the book by your side, comparing every page to the film on screen like a complete nerd. I know I will be."

You cannot miss this if you are a fan of the graphic novel. I read it after I saw the film, and I can't decide which was better. Of course, the book had more detail and explained the story a bit more, but the cinematography and choreography of the film was dazzling.<br/><br/>I'm against CGI, but, in this case I can make a huge exception. The fight scenes are the best you'll see in ANY film. The opening is stunning, and the entire visual quality of the film is unforgettably brilliant. Of course, this applies to all of Zack Snyder's films, but especially to this one.<br/><br/>I'm also very impressed on how the film had no stars. Instead, chosen to act were actors who were identical to the characters from the comic. Everything was just as you imagined in the book. I'm especially impressed with Rorschach, who was just the same as in the book: perfect. His costume, the growly voice, everything was brilliant.<br/><br/>The Comedian was another perfectly adapted character. He seemed like the ultimate anti-hero, really getting a lot of hatred across to him, but still... he was so cool.<br/><br/>The script is just as perfect as in the graphic novel. All of the philosophical, meaningful, dreamy lines... it's a wonder this film didn't get so much praise as it should have.<br/><br/>The plot didn't get across as well as it did, which I think is one of the only minor flaws, along with the ending. Otherwise, this film is a must-see for any cinema fans.<br/><br/>10/10. See this film, no matter what Metascore tells you."

","I'm not one to gush, especially over action films, and particularly comic book adaptations. And I should say here before I go on that I was hugely disappointed by Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT. But WATCHMEN so far surpassed my expectations that I had to write in and vote for my favorite movie of the decade (it just surpassed MEMENTO).<br/><br/>Casting and performances were almost dead on. Kudos especially to Jeffrey Dean Morgan's star-making turn as the Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley's amazing transformation, both behind his digital mask and without it, into Rorschach. I agree with some other posts and reviews expressing disappointment regarding Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, but he grew on me and by the film's end I had learned to respect, fear and despise Goode's Veidt.<br/><br/>Visually, the film simply brought WATCHMEN's visual style to the screen as if Dave Gibbons' artwork was a working storyboard. I can't imagine a more rigorously faithful replication.<br/><br/>One quibble: some of the on-screen violence was so amped up from the graphic novel that it shocked me, particularly a fight scene in an alley where Dan Dreiberg and Laurie Jupiter literally slaughter a gang of thieves. I expected that kind of viscousness from Rorschach, not from Night Owl and the Silk Spectre.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but for now I'll just congratulate Zack Snyder and put him at the top of my list to adapt that other majestic opus so often put in the same sentence as WATCHMEN. I'm referring of course to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. That's a long shot given the commercial success of Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed."

","First off, I have not read the comic book, I was not sucked into the hype, simply because I thought the trailer made the film look so CGI packed and ridiculous. Saying that, maybe that is why I loved it. Just a year after the fan and critically acclaimed The Dark Knight, which really took the superhero and comic book genre to another level, Watchmen achieves great heights as well. It is another Masterpiece of this genre, and to me, it was pretty much perfect. It is not the realistic, gritty drama that The Dark Knight was, and for that reason some will not take it seriously, but I really thought it was just an amazing film. The acting was great, as was the writing I thought. It really should not be compared to Zack Snyder's other films. It puts 300 to shame. The visual style is just as great and surreal as any other epic, and the visual effects are outstanding, flashy, but not too realistic, which is the only way that it could have worked. I find it sad how many critics have dismissed it for being too long, and too much of a mess and dull. I can see why they said that, because this film is sure to dismiss a lot of people off. But I thought it was genius, and this is certainly the best superhero film ever made, next to The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>10/10 Seriously, go watch it!"

","Well, I really don't know where I have to start. First of all, I have heard many poor reviews about Watchmen but since I liked to early comics so much I decided to watch the movie. It was DISASTER, there was nothing to watch, some people were sleeping and it wasn't hero movie or action fantastic film, it was Hollywood's short pornographic film that tries to steal money from your pocket. This movie was the biggest example of how Hollywwod kills the comic book story and its true identity. I was so disappointed and there was so many useless science that made me so angry. If anyone wants to watch this movie, I strongly advice not to, or it will be waste of money and time.

","I couldn't bring myself to give it a 1 star rating, but I came damn close! I was one of those viewers that didn't read the comic book or whatever you call them these days (graphic novels? oh yeah, that's a good one....it's a damn comic book. Even if it costs 20 bucks.) Regardless, this movie Tanked with a capital ""T."" A confusing mess with retro gadgets and enough sepia tones to last a lifetime (please, no more)this flick was a waste of good money, talent etc. It was just awful! Worst of all, it was plain boring. Do not rent this unless you can't find any Ed Wood films. I really don't have much to say about this movie and IMDb is telling me that I didn't have enough lines in my review. Can I say ""boring"" like a thousand times or will they get mad?"
"rzajac","10","10","18","15 August 2009"," Worth watching for you?
","NOTE: This is a cut/paste (and slight touch-up) of one of my message board comments. It pretty much addresses my take on a prevalent, hot issue re ""Watchmen""; it it worth watching?<br/><br/>Here's my experience: Snyder opens up with the murder of the Comedian. I want to know why; he seems like a strange, rich, complex person. A bit tragic, perhaps? Who is this guy in his penthouse app't, reading Hustler and channel surfing? And why a crack assassin? Oh! Look! A bit heavy-handed, perhaps, and no doubt impaired by encroaching post-middle-age, but he does pack a wallop! And why does the assassin at least afford the Comedian some semblance of a fair fight?; he could have just plugged him in the brain and pocketed the fee. Is it because it's a movie, and people expect action, or is there something else? And then the credits montage rolls; beautiful, colorful, with taunting images that set up the parallel universe in which Silhouette gets the nurse, we get a good look at the dude on the Grassy Knoll (do I know him?(!)), the phalanx of National Guardsmen shoot the DFH's point-blank, and some blue dude is shaking hands with Kennedy.<br/><br/>At this point, I'm on the edge of my seat; and I don't mean that literally: The film has given me all the cues I need to get locked in and poised to take in the story from a particular mindset. I'm going to be scouring the screen, looking for visual clues, contextualizing the flashback vignettes, carefully processing the spoken lines to try to understand what makes the characters tick. I know that sounds like a normal response to normal storytelling, but for me I'm talking about one especially engaging kind of movie storytelling.<br/><br/>And this is what this kind of movie does to me. Memento (Christopher Nolan flick with Guy Pierce) did this to me, for pretty much the same reasons; on-screen characters are doing things out of the ordinary, for reasons that may be opaque at first, but the film work quickly leads me to believe that if I do my part, if I pay attention and dig hard enough, I'll break the code and understand. And, if I'm really lucky, the flick will not have lead me astray. It pays off in silver dollars.<br/><br/>Watchmen does all this for me."

","Wow. What a horrid movie. I've read the book and from the trailers I was interested and even excited to see the movie. I've come to realize now, after 3 hours of my life are wasted that this book cannot properly be translated to the screen.<br/><br/>Yes, the book was dark, brooding, bloody and sometimes hard to take in, but the movie was unnecessarily brutal. Approximately half-way through, it became apparent that there was no hope for redemption. I gave it 3 stars for the special effects (though they were oddly placed) and one or two scenes with Rorsach, but the rest of the movie was craptacular - especially the laughable attempt at intimacy... if you've seen the movie, you know which one I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I hate being disappointed after trailers made it look so good. Unfortunate that the director got too wrapped up in his own self-importance and forgot to regard people's time.<br/><br/>I know a lot of work went into this, but I'm sorry - it does not belong in the top 250."

","If you like films with nudity, gore and no plot line, go see Watchmen. If not, don't waste your money. I saw Watchmen in Gold Class, and spent more time enjoying the comfy chairs than I did the mind-numbingly dull Movie. Watchmen is basically blood, violence, horribly unrealistic sex-scenes, and clichÃ©s, with a few lame attempts at a plot thrown in here and there. I saw 300 four times when it was on at the Movies, and walked out of Watchmen about two thirds of the way through, unable to sit through the rest out of sheer boredom. Honestly, I spent most of the film mentally critiquing it. All in all, Watchmen fell very short of my expectations."
"tchockythegreat","5","42","98","6 March 2009"," Mechanical and only occasionally sublime
","If Zach Snyder's intent was to make the cinematic equivalent of reading a comic book when he made this movie, then he succeeded, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>This was one of the most mechanical movies I've seen in a long time. Every inch of this movie seemed to be crafted with the precision of a surgeon and an unbelievable amount of respect for the source material, excluding the ending, which is radically different from the novel. Because of the precision and carefulness of the crafting, however, the movie often feels lifeless and inorganic. In Watchmen, New York City is transformed from the City That Never Sleeps to the City That Just Is. It's flat, soulless, and mind-numbingly dull. This drabness carries on into the storyline itself, which drags on for an exhausting three hours, and only occasionally does it become the vibrant, sublime work of art that the graphic novel is. Even the movie's grisly action sequences seem to be more rote than riot.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley, for the most part, makes this movie. He is completely believable as Rorschach, and despite his performance being mostly one-note and monotone, he seems to be the most three-dimensional character of the bunch, thanks largely to the enigmatic nature of his persona combined with how much of a sheer bad-ass he is. The rest of the performances range from solid to awful. Patrick Wilson is enjoyably goofy as Nite Owl II, and Billy Crudup captures the aloofness and disenchantment of Dr. Manhattan fairly well. Matthew Goode tries his best but ultimately his performance as Ozymandias lacks the punch it should have had. Malin Akerman winds up delivering the weakest performance in the movie. The casting director that decided to give her the role of Silk Spectre II needs to lose their job. The only thing that Akerman did well in this movie was look good both in and out of her jumpsuit, while completely failing to capture the essence of the character she was portraying.<br/><br/>At times, the movie is brilliant. The scenes with Rorschach in prison are executed well. Several of the flashback scenes carry some unexpected dramatic punch. The new ending is fairly well done.<br/><br/>I just have this feeling that the producers and the director were a little too obsessed with keeping the movie as true to the novel as possible, and wound up sucking most of the life and the humanity out of the project as a result. What resulted was a draining film experience that felt more like turning the pages of a book than the organic experience a movie should be. And after considering that reality, I'll stick with the comic, as should you."

I saw many couple get up and leave long before I did. Second, the movie is confusing. They jump from one bizarre storyline to another. These filmmakers must have thought this movie and it's topic are so incredibly interesting that everyone else would think so to. Guess what - they're wrong. It's bizarre. The movie is also very violent and gory in many parts. In short, Watchmen deserves to crash and burn. Be careful about all these positive reviews. The movie stinks."

","Compared to the comic title, this movie would do without the graphic novel. The surprises and suspense from the dramatic scenes are simply not there. The real world, the arms race, controversy and blame over the cold war portrayed by the media is not there either. The dialogue between Mr. Manhattan and Ozymandias confuse me to pieces. Who is who? And why are the most important, and philosophical conversations between the two missing? As if to keep away the mysteries of the universe portrayed in the comic. On some bright sides, I see that the characters like Silk Spectre, Nightowl (eg sex and romance without the romance), Comedian and some other characters are of comic likeness. Rorschach is the only reason to watch the movie because of its comic accuracy though. And why blatantly nuke a bunch of random people without telling them why? People with no background or synopsis to the story> Practically skipping the whole 'genetically engineered psycho-virus' thing. The outlandish music and the portrayal of the 70s aren't really on par with the comic since it took place in the 80s. A dark setting, civilization's bleak outlook masked for it would be too hard to portray generations of civilization and its achievements on screen without a cast of a few thousand people. I mean come on Superheroes using superpowers (lacking emotion, and empathy to say the least), beating people up, and saving lives when in the comic it is clearly told that Dr. Manhattan is the only one with actual powers save the irrelevant dream-like sequences being added. And again with the computer generated images. Sticks out like a sore thumb. I guess it had to be done to the cat but I mean costume? At the high point of anyone's lifetime we suffer and feel like any fragile creature would and Alan Moore took advantage of that.....the movie shows it wasn't that easy, Pure eye candy. The end."

","Coming from the visionaries of Sin City (Masterpiece) and the not so good 300 (Plain Art on canvas), Watchmen is without a doubt, the worst and potentially the most confusing film I've seen all year. I hear around town that you've got to read the novel before contemplating even viewing this film but for God sakes I didn't read one single Lord of The Rings or Harry Potter book before I saw the movies and I could understand them close to perfectly. <br/><br/>I think saying that you have to read the book before watching it, just lets the Scriptwriters off easily with their baffling work of pure rubbish and lets face it, if the vast public who didn't read it were told that they simply must read it to comprehend the film, then the film wouldn't exactly be attracting to much attention in terms of viewers. But thats neither here nor there. <br/><br/>Through my eyes, from viewing this sinfully boring and aimless picture, the only exciting part was the action packed first 10 minutes. Then I had to be introduced to the ever so verbose and painful to listen to, Dr. Manhattan who evidently showed no fear of going commando in front of all his mid life crisis struck, superhero friends. Jeff Buckley's masterpiece, ""Hallelujah"" wasn't even enough to raise this ladder from the pits.<br/><br/>However, the good side, if you spectate very microscopically is ever so subtly there. The up side is the special effects. The CGI was mega smooth. But still it didn't have the edge in animation on it's past films such as 300 or Sin City, so on a very small scale, it barely brought the film up through my eyes.<br/><br/>I say, ""BRING ON SIN CITY 2!""<br/><br/>My verdict, and hopefully useful advice would be to steer clear of this mindless waste of money. Rent it out if your still eager."

The awkward sex scenes are unnecessary and even the music in the film was corny. I would say that this movie lacked something but that would be an understatement, this movie lacked mostly everything.

","I went into Watchmen with relatively low expectations. I never bothered to see 300, and I was certain this would be yet another in a line of poorly made ""style over substance"" films in which there would be more effort put into the dissociative CGI/video-game effects than any real character development or plot.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect is to find this film to be so incredibly mundane, tedious, and flat-out dull that it would become yawningly hard to watch altogether.<br/><br/>""Who cares?"" and ""Why now?"" were the two big questions I began asking myself before finally drifting off and wondering to myself why they can't make ""good"" comic book movies anymore like Tim Burton's Batman or Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop. Heck, even Bryan Singer's X-Men was pretty good (which is interesting, being that one of the many screenwriters of this soporific mess also wrote X-Men). <br/><br/>What I found so fun and truly innovative about Robert Rodriguez's superlative adaptation of Sin City was that he was able to accomplish all three goals of a film of this nature: 1) He kept the adaptation relatively close to the urtext, 2) He made something that was stylish, fun, a little kitschy, and still made something worth watching with a good deal of substance, 3) Most importantly, he made a real, true-blue, well-crafted film that couldn't have been made any better whether it was based on another text or not.<br/><br/>Watchmen failed horribly in all of these regards.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into too much detail here, because I really stopped paying attention after a while, but we're basically left with absolutely nothing new, not an original moment, line of dialogue, or plot line, and very worst of all, none of the characters seemed to be superheroes at all. They just all seemed to be relatively fast and good at karate, I suppose. One character, played by the absolutely terrific actor Jackie Earle Haley (who, like so many of the other young, brilliant actors along this train wreck such as Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson, seemed to be lost in a lingering soap opera for two hours) literally only had the ""power"" of having some kind of cloth-mask whose face morphs to different kinds of polygons or something. That's not ""super,"" it's just annoying.<br/><br/>Yawn.<br/><br/>The only character who had any actual discernible powers (even the so-called ""smartest person in the world""--the one character whose ""superpower"" was actually discussed--didn't seem all that ""super"") was Billy Crudup's absurdly omnipotent Dr. Manhattan who was soooo super that he could do everything and anything--at least in the extremely limited imagination of the writers and director--and thus was rendered equally boring because there was never any sense of risk or tension with this character.<br/><br/>I understand that the movie and the graphic novel are supposed to be about the more existential and ""realistic""/psychological realms of the superhero archetype, but even this supposed ""postmodern"" angle on the superhero trope has been done to death by countless movies and books over the last few years, and much better, too (usually funny, light-hearted fare such as the ambrosial The Incredibles or even the slightly less well-crafted Mystery Men).<br/><br/>Clearly, as is often the case with ""movies"" of this nature or as with sports and other ""soap operas for men"" such as professional wrestling, fans have a taste for this kind of thing that blinds them to anything else other than the fact that they're watching crap. As with people who can't get enough of Star Wars, it comes down to the fact that they're watching their dreams come alive on screen, and whether it's good or bad, they could care less...<br/><br/>... kinda like me when I watch drivel like Watchmen. No wonder it's doing so poorly. Hopefully the Hollywood brass will finally take a hint and realize Zack Snyder needs to go where he belongs: making snazzy commercials or maybe a show on Showtime or something."

I'm into the DC comics and there aren't many films based on the DC universe and Watchmen is added into the list which is why this is one of the most awaited films of the year for me.<br/><br/>The story is set in an alternate 1985 America where tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union are high and the ""Doomsday Clock"" is set at five minutes to midnight, former superhero turned vigilante Rorschach discovers that one of his former colleagues has been murdered. As he investigates the murder he uncovers a plot that is intent on killing and discrediting all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with members of his former crime-fighting legion, including Nite Owl II, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, they uncover a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy that not only links to their shared past but has catastrophic consequences for the future.<br/><br/>Watchmen is such an amazing film that is entertaining and exciting throughout, the story is really appealing and is assembled with glossy professionalism. I really like Zack Snyder's style of film making it is visionary and has lots of slow motions. The slow motion scenes may be annoying for some people but not for me because I think that it makes the scene very effective. The cinematography was excellent and you can see every penny spent from the $120 million budget.<br/><br/>Overall Watchmen doe's have something for most people to enjoy and I really intend to watch the movie again on the IMAX because I know that it will be like a dream world in that experience."

"The_Defiant1","3","14","28","8 March 2009"," As Bad as the Comic...
","This movie, like the comic, takes every wholesome and positive things about the superhero genre of comics and tosses it aside. Alan Moore must have felt that he was brilliant when he borrowed the wholesome characters from the Charlton Comics line. He renamed them and turned them into murderers, rapists, tramps, and sociopaths. Like a lot of his work, he uses pop culture references and mocks them. In this case it is superheroes. Rather than try to intelligently incorporate the positive ideals and inspiration that superheroes bring to the reader, he set out instead to degrade and mock the optimism. He does this while retaining everything geeky and nerd-like in the superhero genre of writing.<br/><br/>Visually this movie deserves an 8. The acting deserves an 8. The story however is so bad that it completely negates all the hard work done to make it look good on screen. The story alone drags my rating down to a 3. This movie suffers from one big problem that can be found in other bad movies... flashbacks within flashbacks. If these events are relevant, start the story with them. If they are not, put them on them cutting room floor. Dragging the viewer through a mystery, then tossing in a back story to justify it, is not good writing in my opinion. It's distracting. It muddles the relevance of the plot. It just makes me not care about the characters. The only character remotely interesting was Dr. Manhattan. Watching full nude scenes with him throughout the movie was just annoying. It was unnecessary and another reason not to care about a character. I was glad when this movie was over. It's a shame there was no nuclear holocaust to put the characters in the film to rest."

","I read most of the comments made by other Ppl and i am really wondering if they actually saw the movie or just that was made by the same ppl as 300. <br/><br/>Most of this kind of movies like 300, Sin City had a little action at least a plot some intrigue and then a final glorious or not. The way the movie was has is special touch, a new kind of touch thats why lots of ppl like them. <br/><br/>Now lets talk about Watchmen. First (and i mean the first 2 h and 20 min) the characters presentation. I mean who pays to watch what the characters eat drink go to the toilet for the first 30 years of their lives?. After this introduction the last 15 min was the intrigue and the final(nice one but damn i got so bored that i didn't really matter).<br/><br/>So lets say thing that sucked in this movie(all actually but lets specify). <br/><br/>First the characters. Tell me how a human(not super Human) a regular one can punch through a wall. And after that get smacked to 3 tables a bar and still able to get up(the main idea of the film was that super heroes are ppl actually). At least other SH movie got some explanation about how they got they're powers.<br/><br/>Second the costumes. Well lets say that a regular Halloween party has better costumes than this movie. I think they just wanted to make a movie and they got no idea what to put in it.<br/><br/>Third the sex scenes. Damn i seen better porn in a 100$ budget film.<br/><br/>Fourth no distinctive ability's. Everyone does the same thing. Punc and Kick<br/><br/>So in conclusion if you have trouble slipping Rent it. It will put you to sleep 100%. Bad acting, bad costumes, most of the actors were dragged from the streets with no experience."
"ayanami79","1","16","33","9 March 2009"," 2nd worst movie I've ever seen!
","To tell the truth, I've never read any of the Watchmen comics, so I had no idea about the characters. BUT! I think that a superhero needs to be a positive figure, which fights for the truth against the bad guys (like Batman or Iron Man) and in addition has some super skills, like Spiderman or Superman. They should be the hope of men who helps no matter what happens and they are righteous. Here I only found mixed characters. Let's see the Watchmen! The Comedian, who's been killed first, liked to kill people; killed also her pregnant Vietnamese girlfriend, and tried to rape Miss Jupiter. Superhero, huh? Or Rorschach, who was a serial killer, BUT he was the only one who fought for the truth, even gave his life for it. Mr. Manhattan, who was rather represented as god than man: creates and destroys and had a funny dick. Adrian, the genius who betrayed his ""friends"", the other watchmen and killed thousands of people in the name of Jon, for the world's peace. It this the way a superhero should act?! I don't think so. Then let's see the film. First, the movie was represented from Rorschach point of view, but at the end, it was rather from Mr. Manhattan's view, which accepted Adrian's conspiracy and killed his own friend (Rorschach) for world's peace. Is that what it is?!?! Does this mean that if someone kills thousands of people for the world's peace, it is okay? The film claims YES.<br/><br/>This was the second time I planned to leave the movie before the film ends, but I just did not want to disturb the others. The whole movie is so boring, there are no action scenes, but the film is full of cliché, like the bad man was among them. :S It had a very ridiculous sex scene and the catharsis: when Mr. Manhattan finally perceives the beauty of human being. Yuck! I just can't believe how someone could make such a bad movie! Hearing the other's comments, they didn't like it either. So I suggest to save your money for something that is really worth seeing, and wait until Watchmen comes out in DVD. :)"
"ter-chow1986","6","16","33","7 March 2009"," WARNING: Overrated MOVIE
","This is a terrible movie. I want to save tons of people time and money. I am usually a very very faithful imdber, and most ratings I see on IMDb are very representative of the rating I would give it personally. (Most of the time I can guess a movies IMDb just by my own personal preference of the movie). <br/><br/>Anyways, I went to watch this movie knowing it got an 8.5. I expected it to be overrated by all the Watchmen lovers / cult people. If you have read the comic book (i think its a comic book not sure), I'm sure you have a different opinion of this movie. <br/><br/>For me, it was lame. This is why:<br/><br/>1) Very very slow movie. 2) Corny lines. 3) The action sequences were not particularly exciting. In fact I would say that I arguably didn't even see a single new type of scene that I haven't seen in another movie.<br/><br/>If I could include spoilers I would be able to let you know why I thought this movie was so bad. Since I can't, to give you an example of how much I didn't like this film, I went with 3 people. 1 left the movie 1 hour in. Me and the other felt like there was a chance it would pick up so we stayed in the movie. By less then the 2nd hour, I was asking my friend if he wanted to leave as well. We stuck through. As soon as we saw close to the end we got up and left. <br/><br/>This movie was terrible because it is a cliché and extremely excruciating to watch such a slow movie. The action scenes are nothing new, and just because a movie has a lot of blood in an action scene doesn't make it good. The voice of one of the main characters is so freaking annoying. <br/><br/>This movie at best deserves a 6. I would prefer to give it a 5.5, but a 6 is what I give it because the visual effects of the movie, are actually very well made. That was the one positive of the movie. Some very cool ideas, and some cool effects. However, dialogue, sequence, action scenes, everything else made it not good. <br/><br/>Be prepared to enjoy the visual effects, albeit in action sequences that are predictable and played out. Enjoy the cool quantum mechanics related ideas. But as for enjoying a movie? This isn't a movie to enjoy.<br/><br/>PS Treat this review from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the watchmen, but went into the movie thinking it would be awesome from the trailer. So no, I wasn't biased into thinking it sucked from the beginning, it just actually sucked from the beginning. I have no biases, I actually was hoping to see an amazing film. I was terribly disappointed.<br/><br/>Watch the Watchmen expecting a film that deserves a 5 on IMDb and you will get what you paid for. Watch it expecting a 8.4 (which it currently shows), and you will be EXTREMELY disappointed."
"benoit-3","1","15","31","1 August 2009"," ""Do you like snuff-porn movies, Jimmy?""
","Alan Moore had his name removed from this obscene putrescence and it's easy to guess why. Whereas Moore wrote a thoughtful genre piece on what could happen to the US if Republican hawks stayed in power past Vietnam and as a cautionary tale against the coming fascism of Bush and company, the movie version is simply a snuff-porn version of ""The Days of Our Lives"" made all the more unwatchable in that it compresses the events of 40 years in a 3 hour movie.<br/><br/>I never read Moore's graphic novel out of contempt for American so-called intellectuals who really believe, in their current state of illiteracy, that their best works of fiction can really come from comic-books, even when they are well-intentioned and well thought-out comic-books with pretty pictures. I should have also refused to see another film by the makers of ""300"". Their only inspirations are video games, the adolescent revenge scenarios of the WWE, regular pornography, torture pornography, snuff pornography and, of course, comic-book violence. The level of insistent, in-your-face, detailed, lingering as well as explosive, sickeningly ""imaginative"" mayhem in this opus makes ""The Dark Knight"" look like ""The Adventures of Tintin"". The only factor that contributes to keeping the gag reflex under reasonable control is that the photography is so murky at times as to be almost undecipherable on DVD, even on a state-of-the-art monitor working in full-blown torch mode.<br/><br/>The film is also aesthetically and structurally unbalanced. I won't even mention the asinine, cliché-ridden, wince-inducing dialog, which is worthy of a doctoral thesis on the dumbing-down of America or the sleep-inducing blue-green colour scheme, which is the signature of all pretentious failed cinematic masterpieces of the last decade. But the idea of mixing all that shtupping and dismemberment with protest and art songs of the sixties, seventies and eighties is simply revolting. I will never be able to listen to those songs again without feeling something of our collective past has been desecrated forever. The film is composed of two unequal parts: (1) one hour and forty-five minutes of incomprehensible exposition where the spectator is asked to memorize the back-stories, names, surnames, aliases, murderous habits and hidden identities of a dozen or so totally despicable non-entities who don't seem to have any superpowers (except for Dr. Manhattan's freakish nature and the others' ability to kill on demand) and (2) one hour (minus interminable credits) of full-blown but equally incomprehensible and disgustingly as well as gratuitously graphic ""action"". The film's moral is that America has lost its moral compass and its soul. The fact that this film was made at all and that it was a relative success in the US - a success that will probably open the door to even more egregious and grandiose atrocities - is ample proof of that demoralizing fact.<br/><br/>P.S.: The saccharine grafted-on ending straight out of ""The Waltons"" doesn't help matters much. There is still no one to cheer for and the whodunit taking up two hours of that film is never satisfactorily resolved."

","I don't get it.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder made only 4 films, and two of them (""300"" and this one) are considered as masterpieces by many, many people, and many consider him one of the most talented filmmakers of the history...<br/><br/>But in my personal opinion, ""300"" was horrible, completely unwatchable, and this film, ""Watchmen"" was even worse.<br/><br/>I never read the comics in which this movie is inspired, but I found this movie to be dull, boring, crummy and poorly made. Not even the special effects were that good. The performances, just like in ""300"" were wooden and laughable, and the plot was insipid and uninteresting at all.<br/><br/>This movie didn't have any single good element. It was a horrible mess, which I forgot a few minutes after watching it.

"XweAponX","10","10","19","17 March 2009"," An Amazing Experience
","Normally I go to a film expecting to find good things in it- The last film I went to the Theatre to see, last year's remake of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" - was a disappointment: But my disappointment in that film was mired in my love for Robert Wise' original film from the 50s.<br/><br/>This film had no such barriers for me, it was a fresh story, a new look, and quite a different experience than what I was expecting, compared to the last 9 years of Superhero moovies: X-Men, Spiderman, Batman, Superman, Iron Man, Punisher, Spawn, Daredevil, now I love these stories, but you can take all of those I mentioned (And more) and put them to one side, and WATCHMEN stands alone in stark reality, on the other side far removed from those basic superhero stories.<br/><br/>I have copies of Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and 300 and as I enjoyed those films, these are not great films: but WATCHMEN is great like Lord of The Rings is great: Great in Scope, Great in Effort of film-making and storytelling, and Great in Cinematography.<br/><br/>And Great in Story: We are told this story through the eyes of Rorschact: We are given a romp through alternate history and we get to see The Kennedy Assassination footage revisualised, the Kent State Massacre atrocity, and the history of the ""Minutemen"" super hero group and the murders of former members- And how fits with what we remember of our own sad history of the last 100 years: WWII, The Cold War, The Vietnam War: The 40's - The 50's - The 60's 70's and this story is told up to 1985 and as a historical representation, this story is accurately told in Music and Images.<br/><br/>And so this is the result of The WATCHMEN Graphic Novel as told by Alan Moore, creator of Marvel's ""Xcalibur"" and ""Captain Britain"" and the author of the ""Inferno"" crossover storyline from Marvel Comics back in the late 80's - Early 90s. Moore despises film versions of his work and his aversion to this almost caused this film to not be made. I've seen other films based on his work: Constantine, V for Vendetta, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. This was the best use of his work but of course he sued to try to stop it being made: This makes my respect level of him go to zero. But that does not stop a well told story from being well told, even if told by a guy acting like a jackass instead of working with the creative teams of these films: League could have been Extraordinarily better if he had been involved, V for Vendetta was fantastic, but he sued to have his name taken off the credits.<br/><br/>This is not a story for comic books to be sold to kids at the newsstand, this is an adult story like Marvels ""Marvels"" and DC's ""Kingdom Come"" both painted by Alex Ross - As a matter of fact, and at this time I do not know who painted the WATCHMEN Graphic Novel, but this film looks like an Alex Ross painted graphic novel so I would not be surprised to find if Ross did the art.<br/><br/>The choice of actors to play Watchmen and also represent figures from our history was well done, Frank Novak makes us believe he is Henry Kissinger and Robert Wisden makes a Nixon rivaling Frost/Nixon's Frank Lanegella.<br/><br/>But the centerpiece is Jack Earle Haley (Sugarboy from ""All the Kings Men"") - As he narrates this story and compared to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine - I hate to admit that Haley's Rorschact is a better Wolverine than Jackman! (He is even short, compared to Jackman's immense height).<br/><br/>There are a few that stand out, a breakaway performance by Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II - And I was in the theatre for the few scenes with Appollonia Vanova as Silhouette: And her appearance caused quite a few wolf-whistles and guffaws, even as a lesbian super heroine.<br/><br/>The use of Non-Familiars as the principles... The murky graphic-novel colouring of the film using dark pastels... Made this film visually the best film I have absolutely ever seen.<br/><br/>This film is a Film Noire Mystery at it's heart... A Whodunit, with the most complex and convoluted plot I have ever had the pleasure of trying to figure out - There is a lot of misdirection here, and I was surprised to be surprised.<br/><br/>I have not enjoyed a film as much since I saw The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy- This story if complete, I hope they do no sequels, I just do not know what direction they could take, Alan Moore outdid himself with this, and I hope he appreciates his own work.<br/><br/>San Diego 3/17/2009<br/><br/>Addendum 4/3/2009<br/><br/>After reading the Watchmen graphic novel and the warner brothers ""motion comic"" - I can say that Zak Snyder paid meticulous attention to detail and every panel from the comic is represented.<br/><br/>I now see what was changed, and in the long run, the story survives, and is basically the same story. The part that is missing is the part related to the mini-comic ""Tales of the Black Frieghter"" which ties in to the part that was changed.<br/><br/>I stand by my review... And after reading the comic, it was like revisiting the film, every shot is from the book, every look, every costume, every vomit-strewn alley is perfected in this Vision.<br/><br/>Much Kudos to Zak Snyder for this immense effort."

","I got the whole super hero theme etc, the contrasting personalities blah blah, yet it did nothing for me. Shortly into the movie we're given a mystery murder, and it all pretty much develops from there as the rest of the super heroes wonder who could have killed the 'Comedian', someone portrayed as a character of immense strength. And after we're introduced to all the characters I found it obvious that it's one of them who killed him (or organised it, whatever) and who's plotting against them, and shortly after you realise it's the Ozymandias fellow who's behind it all, since they stupidly leave him out of the movie for some scenes and this is where we're expected to be 'lost' in the ensuing scenes. Terrible ending, and a lot of awful scenes.<br/><br/>I didn't initially plan on seeing this film, since I was over the whole comic book to film adaptation, yet after hearing from a number of friends that the movie was quite good, I decided to see it. So going in I didn't expect too much (since the hype did put me off a bit), I assumed it would be average and the beginning started off alright. Yet very soon it quickly became clear to me that Watchmen was going to be a waste of time, plus money.<br/><br/>I don't know where to start to talk about it's many faults, there were too many. It just turned out to be a huge disappointment and what annoyed me even more, after it finished, was thinking back to all the hype this movie generated, the high ratings on IMDb, the position it got in the top 250, just all the ooh's I heard from many, I couldn't see what was so fantastic about it. It is the worst film I have ever seen and it makes me so angry to see potentially good films forced into something they can never be."
"Otoboke","Null","9","17","2 April 2009"," It was all a joke...
","A prevailing sense of nihilism washes over the bleak and barren landscape of Alan Moore's graphic novel, the pages lined with fragments of doubt, paranoia, anger and mistrust. It's a depiction of humanity that does not spare any dark corner from the revealing rays of sunlight, casted instead into clear vision; stark, undignified and frightening all the same. Dr. Manhattan would have us believe that we as humans reassure ourselves into thinking that we are in control through delusions of pseudo-omnipotence—a vague and callous form of collective megalomania, devoid of universal sympathy, or an ounce of concrete truth. Indeed, he asserts that rather than embrace the truths of our existence, we would prefer to shelter ourselves under blankets of frivolous distractions fit to serve us to our dying days when we finally have to come face to face with the cold bitter reality that we all mush perish. A dead body he says, isn't any different from a live one; at least, not in form; not in its molecular makeup. It's a cold, objective look at life through the lens of a cynical, and yet completely unbiased view.<br/><br/>Watchmen, in very many ways is simply an embodiment, or elaboration on Dr. Manhattan—a twisted, contorted form, long distant from its idealistic and human ways, instead embracing an indifferent and foreboding stance. The world that Moore paints isn't pretty, no, but it's far from the pages of fiction; or at least, that overbearing sense of reality that governs its message is, and it's tangible and potent enough to go beyond mere fiction. In this regard, Watchmen exists as a rare breed of film that works just as well off the screen as it does on it—it's a film about ideas, criticisms on our own existence, and questions that beg to be answered amidst the petty babbling and double edged swords of modern semantics. Most of all however, Watchmen is a film that manages to do all this, all the while telling a unique and unforgettable tale that resonates long after the conclusions are drawn, the bombs are dropped and the orchestra begins to pack up their instruments.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Moore's depiction here is an Earth rooted in dystopia—if there was a God, he is nowhere to be seen now, and to a select few this was only a matter of time, even if most of the world have only just caught up to the obituary penned by Nietzsche a century earlier. But these select few, casted out years beforehand as a result of a growing disdain from the public for their seemingly threatening amount of power, The Watchmen as they were once known, no longer serve the people—in fact, most are either dead, insane, or have settled down to live as a regular Joe Hasbeen. Yet with disaster looming in the air, there is a spark somewhere off in the distance, and in that short ray of light comes a small miracle; a glimpse of hope for mankind.<br/><br/>Behind this parody and criticism of the commonly accepted superhero mythos, Watchmen details a potent struggle of the hopeless, nihilistic revelations of world gone astray, with the idealistic, somewhat existentialistic hope of a select few with the power to make a difference. Hidden beneath the cracks of Moore's story is an allegory of morality broadened with empathy rather than prevailing omnipotence; it's about a society coming to the brinks of their deaths and then taking one last breath before the final page is slowly turned for the good or bad fortune of mankind.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is a feature that doesn't suit well to casual viewings taken purely on an ostensible level; it isn't built for passively soaking in to the background ambiance of popcorn crunching and soda slurping—in fact, this is a superhero movie that isn't even about superheroes. It demands attention and patience, something which modern cinema goers have no doubt lost much of over the course of the last decade or so. The ""superheroes"" of Watchmen (being no such thing in actuality) exist primarily to offer grander, more exaggerated images, and expressions of our own qualities as human beings, and with that, Moore's story becomes less about what we are watching, and more about what we are feeling.<br/><br/>Yet for all its intellectual benefits, emotionally engaging sentiments, and breath taking visuals, it's the story at the heart of Watchmen that makes it what it is. It's a story that manages to connect not just through the intellect, but through the heart, and through the naturally questioning soul that defines us from all other life we know. That story, which defines humanity in one fleeting image after another, exists here on the big screen as relevant and moving as ever, echoing the current social climate with vivid resonance and potency. Our struggle, symbolised simply by a cute, bright-eyed smiley face smeared with a single droplet of blood, forms the redemptive tear of a misguided and squandered race trying desperately to survive against their own tragically savage nature. It's poetic but grounded and sporadically flawed, but Watchmen nevertheless succeeds in continuing the advancement of the superhero movie into a new realm of adult entertainment fit with intellectually rewarding themes and tangible characters with more to them than tight spandex, special effects and clean-cut morals.<br/><br/><ul><li>A (heavily cut to less than 1000 words) review by Jamie Robert Ward.

"Orestes19","10","9","17","13 March 2009"," Lives up to the end of the decade ""superhero"" movie.
","I have seen this movie twice now, and I can't wait to see it again. I have been waiting for this movie to come out for awhile now, and I was not disappointed. I picked up the graphic novel over 3 years ago and have reread it several times sense, falling in love with all its complexity, philosophical musings, tragic characters, and original dialog. I harbored many mixed emotions about a movie being made,initially I was excited, but a few months ago, I started feeling queasy and thought ""what if this sucks, compromises, and totally misses the major points."" I'm glad to say that is not the case. The film is receiving mixed reviews, simply put its not for everyone. While it does cater to the fanboys it is attracting original fans also. Reading the graphic novel does give an advantage to understanding the overall story line, but its not required for the main plot just as long as one pays attention. Some of the naysayers out there don't like it because it is ""too weird"", ""too long"", ""too reverent to the comic"". Others don't like it because they may have been stupid enough to ignore the R rating and took their kids to see what they thought was the live action Incredibles movie. This was a very ambitious project and very challenging. Watchmen had been in development hell for 20 years. Speaking as someone who thought that 300 was ""just good, not great"" I think no one could of done a better job then Snyder. The acting was great also. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach gave me chills.....he nailed it completely. Best comic book performance ever (or graphic novel whichever you prefer, although nods to Rourke in sin city and Ledger(esp.) for the dark knight). Patrick Wilson was very convincing as conflicted nice guy Dan........who missed his days as Nightowl. Billy Crudup was just wow as Dr. Manhatten....being detached from the rest of humanity while pitying them from afar. Morgan was also a great dirtbag but oh so cool sadistic/yet repentant Comedian. His performance was mesmerizing,esp. after the nice guy rows he has had. Matthew Goode did better as Ozy then I expected........as he did channel the gray areas of his character and his utilitarian philosophy.<br/><br/>I am not going to tell you the ending, but this may be a minor spoiler.<br/><br/>The ending was pretty faithful to the graphic novel but different. The conclusion was the same, but the means to that conclusion were different. And the plan was a little more global then just New York also. This ending made more sense for the movie as the original would of required a whole lot of screen time to pull it off. I was upset would I figured out before that the ending was altered at all. I even figured it out, but upon seeing the movie i was satisfied and proud. The ending may seem slightly more optimistic in the film, it did not compromise the effect or conform to typical American blockbuster endings....."

I could simply not fall in love with the characters. the beginning and character setting is so confusing that you lose interest for the begging of the movie. The ending is so disappointing I felt I last 2h45 minutes of my life by whating this movie. I normally do not write comments, although this movie left me stale and made me what to write up this comment. I know the rating looks real bad, although I can not compel myself to rate it any higher, I like only one seen( the jail break ).

","1) Graphics should be flawless, timeless
2) Experience history to the fullest
3) Give depth to characters in detail
4) Devote time
5) Directe by novel's aesthetic
6) Improvise little but loud
7) Translate protagonists almost identical from source
8) Follow path of narrator's flow
9) ..Never compromise<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, ""Watchmen"" is the crown stone in superhero-based movies.
""The graphic novel, that is impossible to make into a film"" they were saying.
The philosophical questions that Alan Moore raised through his work, it was so unique to see them in an art like comic book. His darkness, his graphic palette, all so unique and asymmetrical with 80's. Everything was attributed to this movie. Some to a large extent and some to a smaller one. Did the ""message"" arrive in time? I think yes! I think the film is there to give things. Is definitely more raw and violent, but the meaning wasn't lost. Not a movie for everyone. But anyone who is willing to see something realistic, will love it.
..and remember, the question is not ""Truth or peace"".
No, no my friend. Not at all. The real question is:
Is this world worth saving?"

","With this dramatic foray into the grand graphic novel of the same name, DC has done it again.<br/><br/>Unlike Marvel, which spews out watered down drivel for the kiddie-crowd, DC remains true to its adult, comic book reading audience. Following in the footsteps of ""The Dark Knight"", the story is solid and is inhabited with multi-faceted characters.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" has it all: drama, suspense, science-fiction, romance, fantasy, and just about everything else. <br/><br/>Most importantly, don't think of this as ""just a comic book movie"". Like ""The Dark Knight"" it's far from it. And bear in mind that the average comic book reader is over 24 years old. Although escapists abound, desiring fantasy fare of clear cut good and evil tales, ""Watchmen"" takes this to a whole other level.<br/><br/>So, if you're sick of the sugary sweetness that is the watermark of Marvel, and if you want something far more appreciative of your adult brain, watch the ""Watchmen""."

Its a mess, visually and rhythmically. <br/><br/>There are two things that impressed me though. <br/><br/>I thought the ""Rorschach"" character was very successful, in part because he pushed a strong path through the chaos that was both the world of the movie and the movie. He was fully integrated: story, bearing, visuals, including some of the setups. Its baffling to me how everyone else would be so clearly inferior in execution. This idea of having a ""mask"" (which is basically just a headsock) that forms dynamic blots — it is genius.<br/><br/>The other thing, dear reader, is something of a personal quirk. I have a fascination with orreries. These are — originally — models of the solar system that were by gears and tracks, novel machinery of different types, supposed to model the movement of at least the planets. As an student of modeling and abstraction, these have a historical significance for me, and I find that they have become a sort of minor but very strong icon in film.<br/><br/>Here we have one, a modern type. It is almost a perfect blend of Superman's crystal fort in the first movie, and the ""device"" in ""Contact."" We are supposed to believe that this is the perfect creation of a perfect mind, one that can see everything in how it works and can model it in such a way that it controls those forces. It is, thus, a model of himself, everything he knows and his transit and container. There is a plot point where the lover's emotions destroy is by simply existing, but that is another story.<br/><br/>I loved the design of the thing; its just marvelous. These three dimensional model- environments just thrill me. I wanted to recommend ""Knowing"" just based on the stellated spaceship alone.

(R)<br/><br/>Laggard and lugubrious adaptation of the much admired comic book series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, deemed unfilmable by many (and hard to argue against that belief based on these results). Takes place in a dreary alternate mid-80s reality where superheroes exist, Nixon is still president (and wearing distractingly awful makeup), and nuclear Armageddon is on the brink; plot is convoluted and often discarded for long passages of time to focus on side ventures and back stories, but such is the price to pay for so much slavish, myopic reverence for the source material. Snyder's fascistic pop-art sensibilities seem like a good fit on paper, but paper is where the story should have stayed; though there are occasional eye-popping images, the action is flashy but repetitive and unengaging, the moral pontificating is flatulent, the music cues are ham-fisted, and the pace can best be described as ""torpor deco."" Only Haley and Morgan leave an impression in the cast (unless you count Crudup's big, blue CGI privates).

","If you're a fan of the graphic novel, there's a good chance you'll like this movie a lot. Despite a few changes it's a pretty faithful adaption.<br/><br/>WHY IT RECEIVED CRITICISM
This movie fell flat with audiences because it's incredibly dark, even for a super hero movie. The characters aren't likable in your typical sense. Heroes like Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan are heavily loved by fans but neither of them make the story any less bleak. Also no one is necessarily heroic which makes it hard to root for anyone. In a sense this is what makes Watchmen so thought provoking and unique. It makes you question what was morally correct and who was the real hero in the end. To many, this kind of content will come off as depressing or disturbing. I wouldn't recommend it to viewers who are expecting an MCU type film. If you are a fan of darker comics like what DC is famous for, then this is probably the type of story for you.<br/><br/>One other critique I have is that some of the dialogue doesn't translate well from book to screen. Snyder added his own iconic dialogue that resonated very nicely with audiences but other parts of the script come off as a bit corny. While I appreciate the film staying faithful to the writing, I think it limits the ability of character development when you can only work with one storyline.<br/><br/>Personally I love this movie. I'm a huge fan of both DC and Marvel so I don't think all marvel fans will dislike this movie. It's just extremely different. Overall I'd say its ability to create a realistic superhero scenario is something that should be praised."

And then, in the ending, they switch theme? And easily kill off the character, who were our main? Who lead the whole thing? Who's the most layered and sympathetic? Because a fragile illusion is better than the truth and that's what we're supposed to root for? I feel stupid. Like, am I supposed to be on board with this, or should I rightfully be angry - is that why they ended up with the journal possibly going viral? Ugh. The reactions of the other characters are what is the most confusing in this sense, 'cause it questions the whole theme of the movie in a VERY unclear way.

Unlike Batman and Superman and the other members of the Justice league these characters where made for a strictly dark world where the lines between good and evil are never clear and always blurred.

","Long before he helped create the ill fated DCEU with Man of Steel and ended it with Justice League, Zack Snyder, known for making a hit remake based on a classic horror film called Dawn of the Dead and making 300 the biggest graphical novel movie of all time, went on to direct a long movie based on the classic DC comic called Watchmen, which came out during the height of the Cold War and became a cult comic among gen xers. A teaser was shown before another DC movie, The Dark Knight, and there was lots of buzz. When it finally came out during March of 2009, it didn't break records like 300 did but made a profit at the theater as well as on home video, where a director's cut was released along with an extended version that included the Tales of the Black Freighter cartoon within the movie that was sold seprately on dvd and bluray in tandem with the film's theatrical release. A videogame composed of chapters was released around the same time on ps3 and xbox 360 to much fanfare, and a soundtrack came out which was pretty good and had My Chemical Romance at its peak. As for the movie itself, it's quite possibly the best epic R Rated comic book movie ever made with an eclectic cast and amazing effects. A TV series based on the franchise is coming out soon on HBO, so watch the movie first and make sure you read the comic book to get your Watchmen fix."
"tiagoroquito","9","3","4","15 November 2017"," An good example of what is an amazing movie
","Zack Snyder gave the world something Dr. Manhattan would deem a miracle: a superb comic-book based film.<br/><br/>Written In 1985 by the experienced author Alan Moore, the graphic novel Watchmen was critical in setting the high standart for the comics we see today, iniciating the current modern age of comics. Therefore it must have proved rather difficult for Mr. Snyder to make a dedicated movie able to live up to it's standarts. In my opinion, it did.<br/><br/>From the awe inducing scenes to its stunning use of music and sound, Watchman is able to take the viewer through the consistent and yet surprising motivations of its characters. The movie's plot is centered around two generations of super heroes and the choices they make after a mandatory retirement. A full 180° range of motivations are present, from the imense blind disgust Rorsharch feels towards injustice to Dr. Manhattans almost complete indeference towards Humankind.<br/><br/>The story flows through the movie with elegance, with frequent flashbacks and references to keep sharp the viewers attention, as does the grim and thought provocking atmosphere that keeps us on our toes. Folks with an interest on politics will likewise enjoy the movies take on 20th century American government policies.<br/><br/>Although the acting was only average, the attention to the smallest of details in every scene, the great use of colour and lighting and the extremely well positioned shots gives the viewer a full immersion through the otherwise tedious two hours and forty two minutes. I do have to congratulate one actor though, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who distinguished himself while portraying his role as the Comedian.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Zach Snyder did an excellent job, as did most of the crew involved in the project. I consider this movie very well edited and directed, and although the acting isn't anything special, the dialog is wonderful, the scenes are breathtaking and plot flourishes throughout the 2h and 42m. I rate this movie 9/10."
"ennieday09","4","3","4","25 September 2009"," Not my type of movie...
","Hearing about Watchmen I was very intrigued with the idea and the characters and scenery looked very good from what I saw in the trailer so I definitely was excited to check this one out. Being directed by Zack Snyder who I am a big fan of I had high expectations for this movie. But sadly I was left unsatisfied and drained.<br/><br/>The best way I would describe this movie is like riding King-Da-Ka at six flags; at the very beginning you get all this adrenaline built up in you and just like that all the excitement is over. I think the weakness of this movie was probably all the different characters and how it tried to follow all the back stories of each character and in doing so made this movie boring to me. I know this movie is based on a famous graphic novel(which i have never read) so I did not know what to expect. The movie was 2 hours and 40 minutes and was probably the longest I've ever felt watching a movie in a long time. It honestly bored me to death and I didn't find the plot, characters, or many other sequences very interesting. This is just one person's opinion but like I always say, the only way to know if a movie is good or bad, go watch it yourself."
"thesar-2","3","12","25","7 March 2009"," Who watches their watch during a movie?
","""Who watches the 'Watchmen'?"" I'm sure a couple of hundred of thousands will the first week. Maybe a few more when the 'Watchmen' gets released in a few months on DVD. Between that time, I doubt many will.<br/><br/>It's got the unfortunate (about) 3 hour time frame (and believe me, you'll feel every minute of those 163 minutes) and the ""not-for-kids""/hard R superhero movie violence, profanity and nudity against it. Whereas 'The Dark Knight' was probably the most adult, real-life super-hero movie, 'Watchmen' really, really wants to be an adult super-hero movie. Almost like a 13-year-old comic book-geek wishing he was older.<br/><br/>Visually stunning in some scenes, enormously graphic in others, 'Watchmen' isn't a terrible movie; it just simply tries too hard. Maybe it tried too hard to put all of its source material in the stand-alone film. Granted, I never read the original comics/graphic novel, so this is all from an outside POV. But I see now why 'Stephen King's The Stand' made its way to the small screen instead. (And I did read that original novel.) Basically, 'Watchmen' disguises itself as film noir, setting itself all over the place from the 1940s to present day/alternate 1985 (reminds me of another alternate 1985 in 'Back to the Future Part II,' as did their version of multiple-elected Nixon reminded me of older Biff in the same film. This absolutely made me laugh whenever Nixon was on the screen. I'm not sure if that was intended, but it certainly was distracting.) Half the time, I had a hard time keeping up with past, future, most recent past; I finally gave up, reminding myself to sort it out later.<br/><br/>It's really just a mystery of who's killing off the superheroes and why. Unfortunately, it starts off that way, and then you almost have to wait the other 150 minutes or so to get back to the plot A. Plots B, C, D, etc are almost forgettable and at times slow. Sure, they seemed to know when it was slow, as they immediately threw in someone getting chopped, sliced, and murdered with a loud action sequence.<br/><br/>I liked the visuals, the style and a multiple super-hero movie with characters they either did explain how they became super-human, or simply left as a mystery. The not knowing sometimes was even better. However, this is the same fear I have for the long-delayed 'Justice League' movie: 12 or so origin-stories, a 12-hour movie makes. I certainly couldn't take even 15 more minutes in this film to figure out how one character's mask shifts.<br/><br/>And I did like two of the characters: The Comedian and Rorschach (though when behind the ink, or eventually unmasked, is dead-on for a young Clint Eastwood.) Their interesting presence actually made me sit up and pay attention.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie had to deal with other characters. Some so laughable, we ended back up with the mind of the 13-year-old nerd who thought these up when doodling during History class.<br/><br/>We had the world's smartest man, who never said one intelligent thing or had any sort of a brilliant idea. We had a girl in spandex (tell me she wasn't thought up by a 13-year-old boy) who's main powers are, well, uh, dressing nice, slow-mo hair and some karate from the movies. We had a dumbed-down Iron Man/Batman who was about as interesting as pocket lent.<br/><br/>And finally, we have Dr. Manhattan. A very, very naked Dr. Manhattan. Though this didn't offend me and I absolutely appreciated this adaptation wasn't trying to shield its audience dropping its level to PG-13 status. But, come-on, I haven't seen this much full frontal male nudity since, well, never in the theater. When I saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' I definitively heard the male audience wince at the roughly 12-seconds (in the entire film) of Jason Segel's penis. I can't wait to hear the fanboy's reaction to male genitalia roughly every 4-5 scenes.<br/><br/>But enough about his smurf-blue penis. His character was mildly interesting, but what frustrated me about 'Lord of the Rings' is the same in 'Watchmen.' Whenever there's a character with basically omnipotent power, the solution to solving all of Earth's (or Middle Earth's) problems seems so clear and no one seems to want or thinks to use such power. How about wiping out the Earth's nuclear bombs with a single thought (or just blinking that ring to that volcano)? Yes, I realize there's a lot of ""learning"" to do and it would end up as a 15-minute short film given my solution. But given I have little patience, a 3 hour (or 9 with 'Rings') movie probably wasn't suited for me anyways.<br/><br/>The music was loud, overbearing and too much of an 80s homage. The dialogue, at times, was hilariously bad. And when the twist is revealed in the closing, I almost laughed (again, probably unintentionally) on how everyone went on as if nothing happened.<br/><br/>'Watchmen' is worth a watch, but I should've just wanted the couple of months for DVD. I certainly needed several breaks. Heck, even 'Lord of the Rings' let a year pass between ""learning"" sessions so you can recoup."

The same goes for the movie. I knew that a movie will never give the same expression and message like the graphic novel. But Znyder found a way to convert the message and the universe of Watchmen in moving pictures. I'm really grateful to Znyder that he didn't obey to the studios and stood in for an exact adaption of the scenario.<br/><br/>This movie has a message, stylish/funny moments, action, great characters and strong violence. Especially the last point could be a problem for the movie especially the female part of the audience gasped at these moments and i got the impression that they hated/disliked these moments. This strong violence is typical for Znyder's movies so be prepared if you watch one of them.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this whole movie and it stands for me on the same stage(or even higher) like ""Dark Knight"" in the genre of hero movies.<br/><br/>I hope that it will be successful because this movie is really special and a brave experiment of the producers (hell they gave Znyder over 200.000.000 bucks) and the director.

"wolfghostninja","8","4","6","10 December 2019"," The Best Watchmen Adaptation So Far.
","The fundamental premise behind Moore's cult comic Watchmen is that nothing good ever happens.<br/><br/>A deeply cynical examination of power dynamics and oppression, the comics were previously called ""unfilmable"", not least because any attempt to make an adaptation required a huge budget, and the only likely source of such a budget woud be a major Hollywood studio - precisely the sort of powerful corporate entity despised in the Watchmen universe. Therefore, there is a deep irony that this film exists and that it is a wholly serviceable and compatible adaptation in regards the source material.<br/><br/>Besides being a worthy adaptation, the film is a modern action/drama classic. Genocide, rape, forgiveness, friendship, impotence, revenge, murder, extra-judicial killings, counter-culture, recidivism, the military industrial complex, the US Govt., class, the media, racism, corruption, betrayal, megalomania are all starkly on display.<br/><br/>The film is true to the source material because of its brutally honest cynicism played out using ridiculous costumes, deliberately over-the-top and earnest ""superheroes"" (just men and women, as weak and as vulnerable as the rest of us), while using the nature and magnificence of one single genuine superman/god to remind us of our inesecapable insignificance in the face of physics and the universe.<br/><br/>A peerless classic."
"pluem_chaisiri","9","4","6","14 June 2019"," The best superhero book adaptation yet?
","I've watched Watchmen many time, and it still impressed me every time. Today, I decided to watch the film once more, since I've just finished reading the original novel written by Alan Moore.<br/><br/>Watchmen is an amazing story, beautifully written, with deep meaning behind every words spoken. The message behind the novel is so powerful, and I think the film has done the novel justice. The first time I'd watched this film, I spent days thinking about it. And surprisingly, the older I became, the more I seem to understand what this story was trying to convey. Alan Moore, the man behind the graphic novel, is a true genius, making us question humanity and morality.<br/><br/>The film made some minor changes from the novel, and it worked. The changes make the film more believable in the real world. One of the changes they made that I absolutely loved is that of Adrian's master plan, from monsters destroying cities to Dr. Manhattan's outrage. With that, it makes the film even more dark and brutal.<br/><br/>While I loved the film, I'm not sure if I like the fight scene. It seems way too dramatic, in my opinion. The slow motion is kind of strange to me, and the movements of the characters when they were fighting look unnatural. However, all that didn't really bother me that much, since the fighting was not really the focus of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly good. I think the casts played their parts really well, just like how they're portrayed in the novel, especially Jackie Earle Haley. He was perfectly casted as Rorschach. His voice, his gesture and his facial expression were on point. He mesmerized me every time he appeared on screen. Matthew Goode, who played Adrian Veidt, is my personal favorite. I like how he portrayed the character. He is not exactly like his novel counterpart, and I like that he seems to be more firm in his belief.<br/><br/>The musics are also wonderfully selected for each scene. I think the soundtrack alone is enough for anyone to invest their time on this film. Some may think that the music is rather out of place, but I think it's just perfect. It helps to convey emotions that the film maker wants us to feel in each scene.<br/><br/>In sum, I loved this film and the novel it's based on. If you haven't read the graphic novel yet, you should really give it a go. It's even better than the film. It's a masterpiece. The storytelling is beyond this world. I was never a fan of American comic books, but this film introduced me to it's novel, and sincerely, it didn't disappoint."

On a surface level this film seems to have done everything (well, almost everything) it could to be faithful to the universe Moore and Gibbons created. Obviously, a lot of people worked very hard to make this movie what it is.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the fact that none of the actors (with the exception of Jackie Earle Haley, pitch-perfect as Rorschach) seem to be doing very much. In their defense, it must be hard to breathe much life into these characters: who, for example, can find a connection with and breathe life into a god-like glowing blue guy, one of whose chief qualities is that he's feeling disconnected from humanity? I don't know, I confess.<br/><br/>Still, they should have (says the former actor) found some way to do it ... and only one of them (Haley) did.<br/><br/>I also have an irrational dislike of Patrick Wilson ... so that limits my appreciation of any film with him in it.<br/><br/>As has become cliché: the book was so much better.

","Watchmen is one of those films that splits the audience into those who have read the novel before seeing the movie and hated it and those who watched the movie before reading the novel and loved it. To be fair, this is very simplified, seeing as there are people who didn't read the novel and still hated it and of course there's the other way around, but there's still a big mixed opinion.<br/><br/>At first I was very sceptical towards this movie, because I had read the novel and was (of course) absolutely blown away by it like everyone else. When I first watched this movie I was speechless at how great Snyder enacts the intro and the simply breathtaking opening credits while the perfectly fitting ""The Times they are A-Changin'"" is playing in the background. Even when I'm writing about it now, I still get goosebumps and that's a testament for a great film. I consider this one of the greatest, if not THE greatest opening in a movie of all time. I was thinking to myself that this would just become better and better the longer it plays and would ultimately become one of my all time favorites. Sadly at the end it didn't hold up enough for me.<br/><br/>But first let's take a look at the cast. Here, almost everyone matches perfectly. Either Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson, Jeffrey Dean Morgan or Billy Crudup, they all do their parts perfectly and look like their counterparts from the novel, but the best one of them all hast to be Jackie Earle Haley. He plays the role of Rorschach so convincingly that you just can't take your eyes off of him. The first time watching I was like ""This IS Rorschach"". His looks, his monotone voice, just everything about him fits brilliantly. There's only one real miscast in this film and that's Matthew Goode. Don't get me wrong his acting isn't half bad and I guess he's not that bad of an actor in general, but he seemed more like a teacher's pet who just graduated from high school to me and not like the smartest person in the world who can overwhelm Rorschach with his left little finger while catching a bullet with his right hand.<br/><br/>The graphic novel is often considered to be Alan Moore's masterpiece and is even on the list of Time Magazines 100 Greatest Novels of All Time, so if you haven't read it, you can imagine how much depth rests within this work of art. That's the reason why many people to this day consider it to be not screenable, but in my opinion Snyder proved them wrong. I think Eames from Inception said it best: ""It's perfectly possible, it's just bloody difficult!"", that describes the whole movie for me. It's a great movie in its own right, but it just isn't on par with the source material. For example, they left many supposedly unimportant things out of the movie, which however contribute much to the atmosphere of the comic book, but to give the movie some credit, there are some things that are treated better than in the novel. Like the overall ending in the Antarctic. I really didn't enjoy the rushed paste in the novel, it all seemed a little half assed (If you read the novel, I think you know what I'm talking about.). Here, they altered this part to the better, while still managing to keep the quintessence from the book.<br/><br/>-SPOILER COMING UP- Also, they changed the whole master plan by Ozymandias. I have to say that I don't really know how to feel about this, because on the one hand, it is a really big alteration from the source material, but on the other hand, I know that they couldn't use the ""alien-plan"", because that would have required to put the back story of the designing of the ""alien"" into the movie and that, firstly would have been extremely hard to pull off without making it a confusing mess and secondly it would have made the movie too long and that's most certainly also the reason for them leaving out such scenes like the killing of Hollis Mason, the first Rorschach bar scene or every scene of the regular people at the newsstand. -SPOILER OVER-<br/><br/>One thing that I just HAVE to mention, is the Action. Holy f*****g s**t this is motherf*****g awesome. Snyder already proved that he is great in doing action scenes with Dawn of the Dead and 300, but in Watchmen he takes it to a hole new level. You can literally feel every punch and kick, every bullet and hatchet, it's just beautiful. The camera-work is great too, you really feel drawn directly into the action. There's also a lot of slow motion, but never too much for you to get annoyed, or to make the action become ridiculous. It's just some of the greatest action scenes you will ever see in a motion picture and trust me that's no exaggeration.<br/><br/>After this big praise comes a little nitpicking, the soundtrack. I've already mentioned the ingenious use of Bob Dylan in the opening credits above, but then there's tracks like the clumsy use of ""99 Luftballons"" which came out of nowhere and went out of nowhere and seemed to only fur fill the purpose of getting across to the audience that this movie's set in the 80's, or the almost infamous use of ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen during a sex scene. What the hell is up with that?<br/><br/>All in all it was a great movie and I neither find it to be a masterpiece nor a total bomb, but it really is an incredible comic adaptation. Maybe not on the same level as the novel, but that's something very hard to pull off, seeing as how acclaimed it is. You should definitely check it out and find out on which side you're gonna be..."

","It surpassed my expectations, which wasn't difficult because being as this is one of my all time favorite pieces of literature I was very concerned about the adaptation, and Snyder did a more than passable job. The cinematography is terrific, and the dystopian atmosphere of the comics is transferred with bone-chilling effectiveness, as is the moral ambiguity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Watchmen does, ultimately, remain a solid illustration of the novel rather than an independent creation with its own statement. Recommended mainly for fans of the super-hero genre, as others may find it difficult to follow."

","If Zack Snyder wasn't interested in pop culture (comic books, zombies, ninjas, dragons...), it would probably be considered as the best director of our time.

","I'll be honest, when I saw the commercials for this movie, I thought that it looked kind of dumb. I had no interest in seeing it in theaters. Keep in mind, I am a huge comic book/superhero movie fanboy. A few years ago, when it was released theatrically, it got mostly positive reviews, but I still had my doubts, so I waited for the DVD to watch it. When it came out, I rented it from Netflix. I put it in the DVD player and was absolutely blown away! From the first scene to the last scene of the movie, I couldn't take my eyes off of the TV screen! The plot was so dark and gritty. The visuals (especially Dr. Manhattan) were absolutely magnificent! The characters are extremely interesting. My favorite is Rorschach! The action sequences had me on the edge of my seat. I also love that there is a ton of dark humor in the movie. I like how they made the movie to be rated R, and that they weren't afraid to show blood and nudity. Overall, Watchmen is a breathtaking experience that I would highly recommend to superhero movie lovers, like me. A+"
"dimitrisalomao","5","4","6","12 March 2010"," Could have been great.
","I read the Alan Moore's comic book, so I knew that this movie could be disappointing, and it is, but at least not as I thought it could be, mostly because of it's style and good acting.<br/><br/>Alan Moore wrote a masterpiece that everybody recognizes that it's one of the best comic books ever written, so with such a great story, it's hard to spoil it completely. Like in ""300"" (Snyder's last work), that everybody said was visionary, for me, it wasn't at all, every single thing in it is taken from the book, every room, or even paintings on the wall, so how can you say the director is visionary?. But I can't deny that Snyder's direction is very stylish, despite those problems, the fighting sequences are great, with an admirable sense of showing the pain of punches, and kicks.<br/><br/>The adapted screenplay, I think, is the most compromising element of the movie, the fantastic idea of Ozymandias (For me, the most important thing in the graphic novel), is changed, taking of the effectiveness and intelligence of his plan, which is unacceptable for a story that is only striking because of it's ending .<br/><br/>Verdict: If you haven't read the graphic novel, you'll have the problem that it will be hard for you to understand the big purpose, but at least you'll not have to know that they ruined a masterpiece of comic books."

On the opposite, their self-satisfaction made me sick.<br/><br/>The music choice was strange. I had the feeling someone wanted to include all his favorite songs in this movie. The music just made me think how much this movie sucks compared to ""The Graduate"" or ""Koyaanisqatsi"", where he took the music from.<br/><br/>I considered to stop watching, but I didn't, hoping the movie would get better.

"caporegime95","9","10","20","4 May 2009"," Great Adaptation
","Imagine a story where super heroes are not always the good guys, and where they could be just as vicious and cruel as many of the villains they fight. This story would be very similar to the film Watchmen. Watchmen is a film that deviates from the average super hero story by making its heroes more human and much darker than the average super heroes. Actually, Watchmen seemed to be more of a murder mystery than a super hero movie to me. The murder mystery aspect of the movie makes it extremely interesting to watch and view.<br/><br/>Watchmen starts off when a ""hero"" by the name of the Comedian is killed. After the murder a masked hero by the name of Rorschach, who wears a mask of constantly shifting ink blots, begins to investigate and comes up with a theory that someone is killing off masked heroes. To not spoil the movie, the rest of the movie consists of Rorschach and the other heroes trying to find out who is trying to kill off the heroes and what is actually going on.<br/><br/>Since Watchmen is essentially a murder mystery with super heroes thrown in, it is somewhat hard to compare it fully to other movies. Watchmen is definitely unique and is in a league of its own, and does a great job at keeping the viewer interested. The story is full of surprises, twists, and suspense.<br/><br/>The Watchmen film does a great job at staying true to the graphic novel that it is based off of. While most film adaptations of novels take many liberties with the stories and characters, Watchmen takes care to stay true, for the most part, to the graphic novel. The only real liberties taken, aside from a plot twist at the end, were to make one or two of the characters' costumes more frightening. This can be seen when comparing the costume worn by the Night Owl between the graphic novel and the movie. Surprisingly, the film still holds many of the dark themes that the graphic novel does. Both stories explore the darker side of humanity and its effects on the heroes. This can easily be seen with what happens to Rorschach, and what events make him become a violent and brutal vigilante. The event is hard to watch and very sad, but the film does a excellent job at portraying it.<br/><br/>The heroes in the movie are not really all that ""super,"" as in only one, Doctor Manhattan, actually has super powers. The rest of the heroes are just regular people who are adept at fighting and dress up in costumes. Doctor Manhattan is the exception to this because he was granted super powers because of a freak science accident. Also, as stated previously, the heroes are not portrayed as having to be ""good guys."" For example, in one scene the Comedian is in a bar along with Doctor Manhattan in Vietnam, after the Vietnam War is over, when a pregnant Vietnamese girl walks in and tells him that she has his baby. He states, ""I'm leaving. I'm going to forget about you and your horrible sweaty little piece of sh*t country."" He then proceeds to tell the girl to leave, but she just stays. Then the pregnant girl breaks a bottle and slashes the Comedian across the face in anger. The Comedian immediately pulls out his gun and shoots her until she is dead. Doctor Manhattan, standing right next to him, asks her why he shot the girl who is pregnant with his baby. The Comedian answers, ""You watched me. You could have turned the gun into steam, the bullets into mercuryYou really don't give a damn about human beings."" This scene shows that the heroes in Watchmen are much darker than what one would normally imagine as a super hero. This gives the movie a much different and darker feel from other movies such as Spiderman and Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is excellent and everything is done and portrayed very well, there are two main complaints that I have. The first is what happens in the ending of the film. Even though the small details of the ending of the graphic novel and movie are very similar, how the events unfold is much different in the two. This difference will only be noticed by fans of the graphic novel, and those who have not read it will not enjoy the film any less. The change seems to have been made because it would be hard to portray what happens in the graphic novel in a film. However, the second and biggest complaint I have lies with Doctor Manhattan. Even though they did a wonderful job on his character in the film version, they seemed to show too much of him. The problem is that Doctor Manhattan is naked throughout most of the story, being that he is almost god-like and does not really have a need for clothes. This results in the movie showing more of him constantly than many would like.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that Watchmen is an excellent movie, and is definitely a must-watch for those who want a new and unique movie. It is also great for fans of the graphic novel due to its faithful adaptation. Aside from the change in the ending and showing off Doctor Manhattan's private area, the movie is excellent. I would recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of suspenseful movies, super hero movies, or just viewers who want to experience an extremely unique and exciting film."

I recommend this title for anyone who has no life and nothing to do for 3 hours. <br/><br/>I thought it was stupid and it didn't even make sense..it was not what i expected i wanted an action movie but ended up with a dud...plus i thought casting was stupid who would you choose the chick from heart break kid to be a main star of this movie? wtf. that really grinds my gears.<br/><br/>Thanks."
"Pushingtin","5","10","20","6 March 2009"," Has its highs and lows
","I would really like to rate Watchmen higher than I have, but there were too many stylistic choices made by Snyder that I don't think enhanced the movie. While true that there's no way to incorporate all aspects of the graphic novel into the film, there were too many character revealing moments left out in favor of extra action scenes. While many of the movie's scenes are virtual snapshots from the novel, in no way is the Watchmen comic an action-based comic. It is a plot and character driven story with deep and poignant dialog that exposes the human condition. Far too much of the important dialog from the novel was chopped down to fit within the 165 minute framework, which has left the film with weaker characters and a much weaker plot. This culminates in an ending that does not make much of an emotional impact.<br/><br/>The other aspect of the movie that I didn't particularly like was the music. There was one spot that I thought worked - the introductory montage set to Bob Dylan was a nice transition. Other than that, I found the rest of the music distracting. Too often, the music was set in the foreground, drowning out anything else happening on the screen. And while, on an individual basis, I like most of the songs that were used, they seemed discordant with the mood of the scenes and the movie as a whole. Honestly, one of the reasons I was excited about the movie initially was the first trailer that used the Smashing Pumpkins song. I thought that music set a much better tone for the story than popular 70's era rock and roll.<br/><br/>Having said all that, there is no doubt that Snyder can put together an action scene unlike anyone else. The movie is visually stunning and the action is so intense that you can almost feel the impact of the blows. Still, that hardly makes up for what is lost.<br/><br/>All-in-all, as my rating indicates, while there were many aspect of the film that I didn't care for, it could have been much worse. There are many redeeming qualities that keep the movie from being a waste of time, but it certainly wasn't what it could have been."

The plot suddenly makes an appearance at 2 hours in and the last 45 minutes are quite entertaining.<br/><br/>The CGI and cinematography overall are superb, this is a heavily stylized movie- it was a graphic novel after all and the music choices are also excellent. <br/><br/>But there's no plot, none. I saw this movie with a friend and neither of us could figure out the point of the movie at all. I guess you have to have read the graphic novel to have a clue whats happening and why. So in that regard it may be like Dune, which is much more enjoyable if you already know the story. <br/><br/>The violence really is quite graphic - think Kill Bill and you'll know what to expect, not that thats a bad thing, its just graphic.<br/><br/>What a waste - I was really looking forward to this movie and pumped that I was able to attend a preview, now I wish I'd stayed home and watched The Mentalist on TV.

"toyman2581","9","11","23","4 April 2009"," A complex and fascinating movie, not for the easily distracted
","'Watchmen' is an excellent and faithful adaptation of the graphic novel with superb acting and a great atmosphere. I actually saw the film without ever reading the book but I enjoyed it so much that I bought the novel soon after and finished it very quickly. Yes, it's dark, it's violent, it's disturbing at times but most movies nowadays are and any schmuck can make a flick with those qualities and little else. <br/><br/>No, the reason to see 'Watchmen' is because it's REAL. Yeah I know that glowing blue super-men are not real. Genetically engineered felines are not real. Richard Nixon still being president (and respected at that) in 1985 is certainly NOT REAL. If you can suspend your disbelief in these things and accept that it's a fantasy story in a fantasy version of our past, you'll be astounded at how believable the rest of the movie actually is.<br/><br/>The characters act and speak as real people do. They interact with each other like real people. They have normal problems and try to solve them like anyone would. The world around them isn't some utopia with a few bad eggs spoiling it for everyone else like in most comic books. You don't see the local caped crime-fighter show up to save the day. Sure, there are ""heroes"" in costumes fighting the good fight in this movie but most of them are middle-aged has-beens and a couple are more psychotic and dangerous than the bad guys.<br/><br/>It appears to me that many people have trouble following a movie that's even slightly more complicated than The '40 Year-Old Virgin'. 'Watchmen' has a lot of back-story and subplots that make it not exactly a linear viewing. Honestly though, if you are paying attention and enjoying yourself, it's not that hard to follow. I was having such a good time that I found any little extra info or secondary plot point made it an even richer experience. <br/><br/>If you don't like lengthy, complex, thought-provoking films then 'Watchmen' probably isn't for you. I'm amazed this was directed by the same man that did '300' considering that was such a piece of trash and this is phenomenal. The story is very engaging and the near 3 hour length of this movie flies by. The cinematography is very well done, especially during the opening credits and the backgrounds/environments are really nice. There isn't as much action as I thought there might be but the fight scenes it does have are pretty exciting. Many people claim that the soundtrack was decent but the songs were at inappropriate moments. I think that all the songs fit the scenes quite nicely aside from 'Hallelujah' during the sex scene because all I could picture was the pre-wedding montage from 'Shrek'.<br/><br/>All told, it was a great movie based on a great series of comics and I highly recommend it. Some non-spoiler highlights include:<br/><br/>1. The opening credits. Nice slow-mo old-timey shots and real historic events/people mixed in and altered.<br/><br/>2. Rorschach. The character is just plain awesome and Jackie Earle Haley kills (literally) in the role.<br/><br/>3. Dr. Manhatttan's origin narration. One of the most emotional parts of the movie despite or because of Dr. M's completely unfeeling delivery.<br/><br/>4. Nite Owl II's hideout. From his suit and night-vision goggles in the display case to Archimedes the Owl Ship, the man's dank basement has some nice gadgets.<br/><br/>5. The anti-hero rally. In a flashback sequence, the Comedian jumps down from above and takes out some protesters to the tune of 'I'm Your Boogie Man' from KC & The Sunshine Band. Genius."

There is no way the spectacular visuals will impress with equal impact on a TV screen.<br/><br/>I went with friends who hadn't seen it yet, and judging by their positive but mildly befuddled reactions, I feel that foreknowledge of the source material is essential. Even though the film's storytelling is solid, the dense plot, time shifts and abundance of characters is a lot of information to process. Get through as much of the comic book (now sold as a graphic novel) as you can, while WATCHMEN is still in theaters. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Those unfamiliar with the story seem to think the film goes on forever. Not so for us who do: the trip to Antarctica signals the final act. You'll also know why Ozymandias has a purple tiger as a pet (one of his companies oversees genetic experimentation, not explained in the film.)

"mjk280","4","11","23","6 March 2009"," Emotionally challenged version of the graphic novel
","God I love this graphic novel. It shows super heroes in a totally different light (read: realistically), the plot is a great whodunit, and the ending is a show stopper that is completely unique. That being said the movie had a lot to live up to and I just don't think it had what it takes. It's a gargantuan undertaking to take something like this to film, but that doesn't mean it can't be criticized.<br/><br/>First of all, I was very happy that they did Rorschach justice. He was replicated pretty darn close to the graphic novel version of the character, I really have no complaints. As is with the graphic novel however, I wish he was in it more! Most of the other characters were translated pretty well to the screen as well but unfortunately they really missed the mark on Adrian Veidt. He was taken from an Adonis-type guy to being ""the smartest man in the world"" that can kick everyone's ass for no reason we know of in the movie. They just simply chose the wrong guy and there's not enough time to bring out his character. He lurks in the shadows of the plot until revealing himself to be the key cog in the whole story near the end.<br/><br/>The movie just didn't carry any weight for me. This story is great because it blends real life implications into it masterfully. You just didn't get the sense that the fate of the world was at stake even after the final ""reveal."" I think the problem is that although they did the fans justice in one way by not editing hardly anything from the original story, the movie moves swiftly when you imagine it chapter by chapter and there's really no time for it to sink in how big a deal all of this really is. I tried to picture viewing the movie as someone who wasn't familiar with the story and I have to say I'm not sure those people would have much idea of what everyone was making a big fuss about. Oh, and the one big change was the ending, which didn't offend me as much as I thought because it has almost the same consequences as the original. Would've preferred them to put the extra effort into pulling off the true ending though.<br/><br/>Not really sure what else to say. It seems a lot of people are disagreeing with me but if you've read the graphic novel and are a big fan I don't think you the movie even compares. The film is like an emotionally dead version of the graphic novel sorry to say."
"Prichards12345","9","7","13","17 May 2010"," A superb adaption of a classic comic book
","Watchmen was one of those movies that spent a long time in development hell; and for good reason - Alan Moore's superb opus was always going to be difficult to get right, yet Director Zack Snyder has done a wonderful job of bringing it to the screen.<br/><br/>The story is a complex affair, exploring how society would be affected if super-heroes were real. All the heroes here have hang ups that would shake Spider-Man to his boots, and the film opens with the murder of The Comedian, a retired government agent whom, we discover, has perpetrated terrible acts of murder and violence during the course of his career. Heroes are now underground or retired, legislated out of existence by the government, but Rorshach, a paranoid but uncompromising vigilante, begins to suspect a ""Mask-Killer"" is on the loose, bumping off heroes that fought to make the world safe.<br/><br/>In truth that's just a brief sketch of the plot, which I won't go any further into as it would be unfair to spoil things.<br/><br/>Watchmen is something of an acquired taste for the mainstream, which perhaps explains its box office performance (just north of $100 million in the US). However the graphic violence and sex which caused the picture to be rated 18 in the UK and R in America also told against it. Watchmen is often uncomfortable to watch, but it rewards the patient viewer with a dark take on humanity and lets us chew over the idea that we may all be doomed in spite of the caring side of our natures. Only love, perhaps, can keep the savage animal within us at bay.<br/><br/>So, if you're expecting Spider-Man or The Dark Knight you'll probably be disappointed. But if you stay on board you'll be given a thought-provoking exercise quite unlike any other super-hero movie. Watchmen succeeds on this score; perhaps fans of Moore will be angry at some of the changes, but largely this is a very faithful version of his story. Jackie Earl Haley as Rorshach is a stand out, but most of the cast do well, from Billy Cudrup as Doctor Manhatten (the only hero with actual super-powers) to Patrick Wilson as Night Owl, a Batman-type character with a, er, rather severe problem. Only Matthew Goode disappoints as Ozymandias.<br/><br/>Explore Watchmen with an open mind and you may love it as much as I do."
"innersmiff","5","7","13","4 October 2009"," Wha??
","Will be spoilers. <br/><br/>Overcomplicated? For a feature film I think so. I never read the GN but I think if they had perhaps left out some of the flashbacks and focused more on one or two characters there would be enough story for me to empathise with them and enough mystery for me to be interested in the others. <br/><br/>It may seem long to many people. It is by no means a record breaker in terms of running time but to someone who was not engrossed in the story it does drag on. <br/><br/>The violence I had a real gripe with. It's not ""cool"" violence, neither is it necessary. Shooting a pregnant woman? Give me a break, that's just harsh! And we're supposed to be cheering on the comedian? And also the sawing off the arms in the prison was completely disgusting and out of place. Would it really have been that difficult to untie the guy before the chainsaw came out? <br/><br/>One person dared comparing the violence to that in A Clockwork Orange. Yes the violence is shocking in both films. It just so happens that in ACO it fits within the context! Watchmen is a damn superhero film and horror-movie violence has no place in such a thing. The gore is distracting. <br/><br/>Why did I feel no emotion towards any of the characters? Well the acting was lack lustre, and the characters so under-developed. To those who read the GN I suppose it would have more impact. The only one I had any interest in was the short guy in the hat and the balaclava with the name I can't spell. His end was not heart wrenching but just gave me an ""oh"" moment. The whole ending seemed contrived and didn't have the effect it seems to want. Kind of an ironic harmony. I was just glad it was over. <br/><br/>Definitely not above average. I was sometimes disgusted, sometimes bored and sometimes confused. That is what I felt like and is not subjective."

So to that affect, I will be brief and succinct as I too try and unravel this vastly complex but ultimately rewarding crime drama.<br/><br/>I cannot think of many more directors working today that could have handled Watchmen better then Zack Snyder, whom I am growing to love more with each film he completes, from the zombie masterpiece Dawn of the Dead to 2006's surprise hit 300, Snyder excels at creating action pieces with underlying moral messages and hidden meanings. <br/><br/>With his third crack, he draws deep into his self-proclaimed passion of the Alan Moore Watchmen graphic novel, and essentially anchors it upon the screen, almost panel for panel. And it is too long. That being said, Watchmen is never boring and certainly never uninteresting. The opening act is visceral and tantalizing, but the following 45 minutes is muddled and ultimately unnecessary. Literature, because there is not a complimentary visual medium, must describe every element and while a graphic novel can half that effect, a movie should still leave more open to interpretation then they did ultimately. The final third is by far the best, and includes the films best scenes and dialogue which take place in a prison.<br/><br/>The prisoner? A vigilante by the name of Rorschach (Jackie Earl Haley), who draws his name from the infamous ink blot test, personifying it by a shifting black and white mask. He is but one of a group of second generation vigilante superheroes including Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), the godlike Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the proclaimed ""worlds smartest man"" Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) and Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson). In retirement and in an alternate reality where Richard Nixon is still president and the American's won Vietnam, the group is haphazardly forced back into action after The Comedian is killed, and a deeper running plot is revealed. Jackie Early Haley is fantastic as the cold, unrelenting Rorschach whose quest for the absolute truth is society's blessing and his curse. <br/><br/>While demanding during the initial viewing, I found myself pondering the morals at play and further respecting and enjoying what I had seen. I suspect this is a film where a second viewing would be advantageous, if not to understand more fully, to again admire Snyder's crisp and engrossing visuals and wholly original mystery that unfolds. <br/><br/>7.5 / 10.0<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

","This film was an experience and a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The visuals were breathtaking and unique. It had all the qualities of a massive spectacle.<br/><br/>Yet, the visual effects complemented the issues and themes that the film was trying to address such as nuclear proliferation, abuse of power, the human condition and so forth.<br/><br/>Furthermore, since this film is based on a comic book, the delivery of some of these themes never felt pretentious. Ironically, since the characters suffering from their existential turmoil are comic book characters, their emotions seemed to resonate stronger given the cynical nature of the story.<br/><br/>Many people have said that this film is a deconstruction of the comic book superhero and I agree. If we trace back the genealogy of comic book heroes, quite a few superhero comics have been utilized as propaganda. This film celebrates and shuns the golden age of superheroes and its' consequences.<br/><br/>The overt violence, sex, oldie and newbie rock worked as subversive symbolism which helped avoid any superhero movie clichés. It's also refreshing to see comic book heroes behave unpredictably.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Watchmen is a lot of things and delivers on many genres. This is one where you can go in with a huge bucket of buttery popcorn with your brain and heart turned on."
"yourbigpalal83","3","7","13","8 March 2009"," Hate to say it but Alan Moore was right for once.
","As the comedian would say, the jokes on me! Well in this case, its true. Watchmen, the much beloved Graphic Novel by Comic writer/legend Alan Moore, is such a wonderful, complex, emotionally charged study of the superhero and what makes us human and what that means, and as a film, its a almost 3 hour bore fest.<br/><br/>Honestly, its one of those thinks were the story is so good, to do it as a film simply does not work. Its a completely different medium. In a graphic novel or a book, one has time to ponder the thoughts and ideas and actions of the story on there own time. In reading the material, one can digest and relate to what is being said and reflected apron at your own leaguer.<br/><br/>In a film, you don't have that option. the story has to progress forward in a way that feels right, that flows with the context and pacing of the film. Some of the timeless classic films do this wonderfully. They SHOW AND TELL you a story. The visuals and music enhance the story were it becomes an almost emotional sympathy in a harmonic emotion that resonates on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Watchmen, fails to do this simply because the story has to be given time to digest, for the audience to question and ponder what is being said, at there own pacing, and not that of a timed structure of a film.<br/><br/>There is some incredibly great emotional aspects to the story. it deals with learning about ones self, about the choices we make, how we choose to deal with situations, our own self ideas of right and wrong, and how our lives matter and hold effect on those around us.<br/><br/>To condense this into a 3 hour film, just simply does not work. this story is not suited for a film format because the moment we begging to identified and reflect on what is going on in the film, we're at the next point in the story and are robbed of the much needed time to think about what the story is being said.<br/><br/>And the ending, is a huge let down to boot. Not because its different then the graphic novel (the giant squid) but because we really cant feel the emotion of an entire city destroyed and countless lives lost in the same way we do in the graphic novel.<br/><br/>In the novel, there's a 12 page spread showing the true horror and carnage of a city devastated. The impact hits us, and Ozzy's monologue at the end of the film resonates that this is a necessary evil to save billions of more lives from destruction at the hands of there government.<br/><br/>In the film, this is robbed. partly due to modern history (mostly 9/11) but also due to the fact that on screen, we as a modern movie going audience are somewhat numb to mass carnage.<br/><br/>Yet in the comic, it resonates because at this point in the story you are so invested in the story and characters and have had the much needed time to personally reflect and identified with the films main characters that when the ultimate conclusion hits, its horrifying and shocking, and yet you understand it at the same time.<br/><br/>In the film, you don't. Your left numb, cold, indifferent. You don't feel the loss of life, your told it. You don't come to the conclusion on your own that as horrible as it is, its the lesser of two evils, again your told it.<br/><br/>Its just one of those things that works great as a novel, not so much as film.<br/><br/>Prehapse if they did risk the wrath of fan boys and truly changed up the film to be a FILM and not a direct translation of the comic book, you could have had a truly memorable story. Instead, your given a live action version of the comic book, and as stunning as it is visually to see what happens in between the panels of the comic, your robbed at the same time of the ability to fill those panels in yourself in your mind at your own pacing.<br/><br/>Its very hard to get any adaption of a comic or novel right for the big screen. But sometimes, one should just realize, that perhaps the story's structure could only work in its right element.<br/><br/>Hate to say it but Alan Moore was right. this story, truly is unavailable.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars. Read the graphic novel instead."
"sistermariepigtailedpira","10","9","18","3 April 2009"," Personal Responsibility
","I saw Watchmen in the theater, I'll see it when it hits our nearby second-run theater, and I'll buy the DVD as soon as it comes out. My bias is clear in discussing this movie.<br/><br/>Outside the theater, I heard various groups of people discussing the movie, and I don't think I'll ever forget what I heard. Teenagers who liked the Saw movies regardless of their gore hadn't enjoyed Watchmen much, although the violence certainly wasn't glossed over in what we'd just seen. Parents who liked bringing their younger children to ""comic book stuff"" looked like the audience in The Addams Family Values who'd just been sprayed with buckets of fake blood in the Shakespeare scene. In fact, the only people who didn't seem thoroughly disappointed were a few middle-aged people I saw who seemed quietly lost in their thoughts and a (very) few people who'd read the book and were at least enjoying an animated discussion critiquing it.<br/><br/>Standing outside the theater with my stepson and his dad, I was almost paralyzed listening to it all. It was surreal. All the complainers were missing the point by such a small distance it felt tragic, like seeing a brilliant child squander a future before it's even started through some silly and pointless mistakes. They were missing the class that really would have taught them everything because that day they felt like skipping and doing nothing they would ever remember later.<br/><br/>The teenagers missed the point that the blood was irritating because it was complicated by pesky reality. The bravado they assimilate like the air they breathe when they watch violent movies with dialog they parrot later for effect is satisfying because it doesn't come with consequences they can perceive. They don't want to think about how blood and bone really, truly factors into their lives. The impulse to beat a girlfriend really does look as ugly as we saw. Murdering a woman carrying your child is as ghastly as that, and so is standing by and doing nothing while someone else commits the act. War? The boys in the group I saw will encounter the Selective Service soon. Images of war directly relate to them. They could have absorbed the lessons of violence, of being with someone who is as unreachable as Dr. Manhattan, of attempting to control others rather than one's self (Ozymandias) and of the adult struggle to unite our compartmentalized natures while still being adults.<br/><br/>The stunned parents could have learned that surrendering the privilege of parenting to Hollywood is folly. People who wear masks and use violence to enact justice aren't easily understandable to children under the most clear-cut conditions. Teaching children to leave justice to our police and courts while showing them you approve of a SPECIAL kind of ski mask to do the job at the very least merits some serious conversations. Furthermore, bringing children to a movie with no research is like bringing them to a party whose content and participants you know nothing about.<br/><br/>The people prattling about Dr. Manhattan's nudity saddened me. Is the male body now only useful for sexuality? How sad that they couldn't see the symbolism in it, that he was so removed from humanity that even nudity taboos were irrelevant. How sad that they couldn't see the beauty of his form, his entire being. How do men feel, seeing their form as something to look away from with distaste? Not like the book? Since when is a moving picture exactly like a book? Differences always exist, because books aren't movies. That may sound obvious, but apparently some people are startled by it.<br/><br/>My family watched it. We were moved, horrified, and provoked. We were provoked to talk, to reread the graphic novel, and to watch the news differently. We didn't wait for a modern Ozymandias to tell us what the movie would be about, and we seized our personal responsibility to form our own opinions. I hope many, many more people do the same."
"m_a_singer","4","9","18","22 March 2009"," Mostly nice to look at
","I found the movie's attempt to match what I assume are the visuals of the source material to be attractive, and I really wanted to like the story's subtexts about such things as the nature of heroics and the shifting boundaries imperfectly separating courage from foolhardiness and cynicism from concern. In the end, though, it was hard to care too much about the film because so much of it was more or less tepidly silly. Even to the uninitiated (like me), the bad guy is clearly announced about halfway through, and his great master plan, once revealed, is one of those dumbfoundingly convoluted but stupid ideas that only works in bad fiction because a character has been given an absolutely impossible amount of resources and lucky breaks by authorial fiat in order to make it work.<br/><br/>The acting doesn't help matters. Jackie Earle Haley is an interesting actor and Rorschach an interesting character, but Malin Akerman is simply awful and Matthew Goode and Patrick Wilson not much better. Having seen Billy Crudup in _Almost Famous_, I know he's a good actor who will likely recover from being in this, if for no other reason in that he is normally filmed in flesh tones and with pants. At least he has the grace to sound bored with his character's ridiculous dialog.<br/><br/>Still, it looks nice, and Rorschach is entertaining (though why he would want to rely on the rest of these drips is lost on me)."
"Cereal_killer247","9","9","18","9 March 2009"," Who Watches the Watchmen? You Should
","OK we have been waiting for this one for a long time and sometimes you have to remember that it could have been done by Michael Bay and truly F@#*ed up.<br/><br/>With that in mind The Watchmen stayed loyal to the fans of the comic. I have been reading that critics are saying it is too loyal the the graphic novel to which I say F@*& that. I personally don't want to watch a Constantine like version of such an awesome graphic novel. I actually thought it was awesome to watch the movie and have shots right from the comic on the big screen. It was fun to point them out to the person next to me. The pace of the movie for me was great you were never saying get on with it or having battle fatigue.<br/><br/>Sorry No Squid but really I actually liked this ending a bit more and it seemed to make a bit more sense. The world would have to unite to fight a man that can be everywhere at once.<br/><br/>I thought that the characters were extremely well done. The Nite Owl is a personal favorite and Patrick Wilson did an awesome job as did Eral Harley in the role of Rorschach. I did not have one complaint in the characters recreation.<br/><br/>And any comic interpretation that my mom loves is OK with me. Just remember its 2 hours and 45 minutes, pee three times before you go in and no liquids for three hours prior. The time really flys by. Remember though it is a movie and try and enjoy it. And you have a lot of problems with this movie and feel that it just wasn't that great you should watch The Spirit and be grateful that didn't happen to this movie."
"jmonek1","10","9","18","8 March 2009"," Wow! As epic as they come.
","This is my first time writing an IMDb review but after seeing Watchmen I thought it was important to tell people how brilliant this film actually is. It is breathtaking and I have to say a masterpiece. Maybe I'm reading too much into what I saw because I have not read the graphic novel myself. But honest to God I don't know what more any of you fanboys could possibly want. I have not (since Lord of the Rings) seen a director pay such painstaking detail and attention to a movie. The music was cleverly chosen and the characters were all brilliant. Jackie Earle Haley was superb as the tormented Rorschach as was Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian. Billy Crudup's Dr Manhattan added a still peacefulness to the film and was able to inspire the awe of a god. I did not find it confusing but compelling and challenging. Moviegoers are too lazy today. I have watched many a flick were the plot is recapped over and over again. Its insulting to the intelligence of the audience and I'm glad Hayter and Tse stirred clear away from that.<br/><br/>I truly recommend this. It is a fantastic experience!"
"nic-b-2108","5","9","18","7 March 2009"," What a waste of money.
","First, I'm giving this 5 stars purely on the great special effects, but then what film doesn't have those these days?<br/><br/>The acting was poor, there was virtually zero character development, and I spent about 70% of the time being bored. The plot has potential, but it skipped between flashbacks and what might've been flashforwards (who knows o_O?), and the history of the storyline was extremely boring.<br/><br/>I had hoped that the gruff 'I need a throat sweet' voice over was going to stay with Bale in Batman, but no. The narrator of this movie had the same 'give me a soother' voice and that was quite annoying. The female lead was also incredibly irritating, and clearly only got the part because of the amount of nudity required for her role. I cannot see many respected, decent actresses being okay with such a lousy script and the nudity. <br/><br/>The story itself didn't pick up any sort of pace at all until at least half way through (that's an hour and a half, nearly :P ). It contained too much blood and gore for my liking. That is a personal preference so does not reflect much on how decent the film is as a whole, but if you don't want to see guts hanging from the ceiling, people having their hands cut off, a man getting a meat cleaver to his head multiple times, two dead dogs, bones being broken (and subsequently bursting through the skin) and people exploding from the inside out... then really don't go see this. <br/><br/>Of course the fanboys of the comics (Oops, sorry, I meant Graphic Novel....) will rate this film highly just because they're fanboys. I got taken along with my best friend and her comic book mad fiancée and even he after weeks of ""omg watchmen!!!"" was unimpressed, as was another comic book loving friend of mine. I wish I hadn't shelled out to see it, I feel it was a total waste of my time and money. I am now just looking forward to seeing the Transformers and Ironman sequels, now there are two great films."
"ForbesantonEvil","3","9","18","6 March 2009"," If you never read it don't watch the watchmen
","I haven't even heard of Watchmen until one day some random dude asked me ""Who watches the watchmen"". And on that day I looked up the movie, that was last week. But in all seriousness it's not that good in my opinion, if you're a parent do not let your child see this. There are random sex scenes with slow-mo action. The action was great when it was there, and the graphics were amazing, but that seems like all it was. I felt they were trying to hard with the slow-motion shots and the dramatic effects. I guess they want it to be as popular as it was with 300. The acting was OK, the ending is a let down if you are a big fan of it. they changed it and it's really terrible. So look out for that one. i was kind of impressed since I went into the theater with low expectations. But yeah it was really bad in my eyes. It deserves what I gave it."
"voodomreyen","9","9","18","4 March 2009"," A surprisingly great Movie
","First of all I have to admit that I didn't read the graphic novel before I watched the movie, so my opinion maybe will not congruent with the opinion of die-hard comic readers and longterm Watchmen fans.<br/><br/>The movie stunned me. It really looks great, has the feeling of a comic and the soundtrack is amazingly incorporated into the movie. The film is pretty violent but this and dark atmosphere of Watchmen make it an intensive experience. The whole scenario with the fallen Superheros is great but it has been told pretty often since the Watchmen comic narrate it for the first time.<br/><br/>I rate this movie very high even now after I read it because it can compete with the comic pretty good and beholding the fact that so many people in my environment (even comic readers) don't know Watchmen this movie is not only great it also draws deserved attention to a great graphic novel."
"rufasto","1","15","34","6 March 2009"," bad bad bad bad movie
","This was bad. After the first boring 15 minutes, I just wanted to go home, but didn't. My views on it: good performances: Night Owl, Rorschach, Manhattan. Almost decent: Ozymandias, Comedian. Poor performances: Laurie, and Carla Gugino's character. It's a bootleg bad copy of the book, they changed, well, everybody knows already THAT what they changed. It simply makes no sense, here's why: they strove to show every single frame of the novel, but the way the characters interact is superfluous. The music, from different eras, is badly weaved with the scenes, and it (the music) gave me a bad headache. The characters are shallow, Rorschach is depicted as a murderer, which he is not. There's no chance to see how much Laurie really hates Rorschach. Carla Gugino's character is poorly performed, despite the undeniable beauty and talent of the actress, I wonder what happened to her. Manhattan is not godlike in any sense, just some sort of a mutated hyper-powered arrogant human being.<br/><br/>There's the change in the climax of the story, also. Just awful.<br/><br/>I see this movie as ""a school representation of the Watchmen graphic novel"", only with sophisticated special effects. Makes me think that what was successfully be done with just pen and paper, is not attainable even when resorting to expensive digital effects."

","I went to my neighborhood multiplex to see another movie. Watchman was playing at half the screens at this site. Yet it wasn't showing the movie I wanted to see. So I did go see the Watchmen. It was the most violent movie, I have ever seen. Also, included in the movie was women being battered over and over in a rape attempt. Not to mention the graphic sex scene at the end. Also Dr. Manhatten was walking around with his genitalia exposed most of the time. For people that find this entertaining is beyond me. The only thing that made me happy was the end. This movie was a perfect illustration of a what a godless universe would look like. And again it was a fantasy that left me feeling empty inside."

I have heard many people have tried for several years to bring this graphic novel to the screen and I can see why, it is pointless, who wants to see the boring day to day life of a powerless costume hero.<br/><br/>The Special effects were not up to scratch and the acting was poor, I have been a comic book and movie fan all my life and thought I would be in for a treat but I was wrong.<br/><br/>I will wait for the real thing in a few months when X-men Origins comes out to renew my faith in heroes.<br/><br/>If your thinking about seeing this movie Don't BOTHER I have not spoken to a single person who enjoyed it.

","I just woke up from going to bed around three thirty after viewing the midnight screening of the Watchmen, and after a night of not much sleep I've decided I did not like Zack Snyders film. The graphic novel is great. It wasn't till my third time through that I really appreciated it for all its deep characters, sophisticated story development and the age old moral dilemma it presented. Do you Sacrifice a few to save many? What I am writing about is how the movie though very visually honest to the graphic novel failed to execute anything but violence and sex. My feeling after seeing the film as a fan of the graphic novel i.............. I feel scammed. I am sorry but screw Zack for changing the ending. Jesus the original ending would have worked out just fine on the big screen. The giant squid thing would have worked, it would have shocked the audience just like the novel. Instead of conveniently blaming everything on the weird blue guy. WHY? For what purpose? Did he think that the audience wouldn't get it? I guess there wasn't enough time for all that sex and violent something had to go. Doc's departure would would have worked better as an aid to world peace, rather than causing it. I thought we weren't sacrificing artistic integrity here Zack. My over all feeling of this film is that they numbed down the intelligence story line(not because they had too)focused on the grisly violence and sex to sell this movie all the while Zack was promoting this as an incredibly accurate depiction when he knew was throwing together a makeshift adaptation with no feeling. But thats pretty much Hollywood these days in a nutshell. Never again Zack Snyder. Never again. This is just my opinion."

","SO much has been written here, that I'm not going to reiterate.. But haters and lovers alike really owe it to themselves to watch the 215 minute Ultimate Cut edition of this movie (not to be confused with the Director's Cut). Adding the animation plus additional scenes (and even a better Blu-Ray transfer than previous releases) has much so much more depth to both some characters as well as motivations, that it becomes easily one of the best costumed hero films ever made...better than DARK KNIGHT, IMHO. (But the love scene still sucks!)<br/><br/>It is also much closer in execution to the Alan Moore graphic novel it is based on. Honestly, I really don't see how it could have been done any better.

","If I had read and was a fan of the novel, I'm sure this would have been a treat as I would have layers of character background and development to augment what I saw on screen. Given only with what was on screen however, I was left with pretty much nothing. The actors gave zero emotion. They were like statues. The director could have saved a bit and just put pictures of the characters from the novel up on the screen. That technique would have worked as well. Maybe better. Just because the characters were flat on a page in a graphic novel, does not mean they need to be flat and lack any life on the screen. Apparently that was the concept, though. Whether it was from a poorly adapted script or poor direction or weak actors and actresses, most of the characters were just not engaging. The couple that were, were so far beyond the other dull characters that they seemed from another production entirely.<br/><br/>Beyond that the special effects and CGI were really nothing special. Mundane, considering the potential and the hype.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was weak. It did not seem to coincide with what was occurring on the screen. It certainly didn't fit the period that was projected.<br/><br/>So, there you go. Dull and boring characters, no help from the screenplay, mediocre effects, and a misguided soundtrack."

","In my opinion, this was the biggest, most hyped movie of the summer of 2009 and was also the most disappointing. If you have seen some other of my reviews, you would know that I love superhero movies. And the fact that this was going to be more gritty and aimed at older viewers got me excited for something different from ""Iron Man"" or ""Spider-Man"". However, sadly this movie failed on almost every level.<br/><br/>First, the characters are unlikable and poorly developed. They are not ""dark"" in a cool way, but instead ""dark"" in a ""I don't really want to watch these losers and scum bags"" kind of way. <br/><br/>The plot is all over the place and the director seemed to care more about making sure Dr. Manhattan's penis is featured rather than any emotion and passion from the characters. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie I was just waiting for it to get over so I could do something else.

","*may contain minor spoilers, but just stop reading this, read the novel, forget the film and move on with your life enriched by the novel and the 2,5 hours NOT spent on the film*<br/><br/>A reader of the novel, I watched The Watchmen with clenched butt cheeks from the start, cheeks Zack Snyder should have kept closed instead of making this movie.<br/><br/>From the beginning I was agonized: some made up scene about a horribly, AND I MEAN HORRIBLY acted ""discussion"" about nuclear holocaust. This is the end of the world they are discussing and these people aren't even the slightest passionate?<br/><br/>The references to the novel are out of place and make situations way to obvious. The beginning ruins the end and things said at some of the very last chapters in the novel are packed in the first half hour. This is done because in the novel, for a long time, only Rorschach believes there's truly a dire situation, BUT WE CAN'T MAKE A Hollywood MOVIE WITHOUT ACTION, DRAMA AND SUSPENSE NOW CAN WE? The ""summery"" of Under The Hood, which are pages from Holly Mason's autobiography in the novel, cover things so hastily they feel very, very forced (especially the Silk Spectre being a lesbian which is quite a topic in the novel, here is a hasty detail), they set no mood and parts of them are entirely made up.<br/><br/>It just goes downhill. It's so strange how there's a novel in front of these writers, there's a script, sceneries, characters and they simply FAIL to get any of it across. Especially Veidt's character completely misses the point of him (and is terribly, terribly acted). <br/><br/>Rorschach is like a damn superhero, even though the thing that makes The Watchmen great is that they AREN'T that, they are merely men in costumes. <br/><br/>*some details discussed to elaborate* Just the opening scene where the novel CLEARLY shows Rorschach using the grappling gun to REALISTICALLY climb the apartment building, here he gets pulled up by some freak of nature device. We've all seen Mythbusters, it can't happen if you don't climb. One might say ""It's a movie, come on"" and I'd agree if it were a Marvel, I'd say ""Meh, I guess"" if it were Batman, but I say ""No way in hell"" when it's The Watchmen. <br/><br/>I also very much missed him trying to open that closet with sheer force or lock-picking before finding the button, because it shows he's not some super investigator. This may be considered a detail and me nitpicking, but I feel I have a right to want to see the novel on the big screen and not some sorry ""butt with double s"" adaptation, because the novel is LITERATURE. It doesn't require a remake by an arrogant Hollywood snob.<br/><br/>On this subject, what the hell is that scene of him breaking in at Dr. Manhatten's lab? He's not a parcour expert or Spiderman or something! Then, he smashes the window even though two guards JUST walked away, but they don't hear a thing. *end details*<br/><br/>Enough detail bashing, the whole plot line is poorly rewritten, the whole movie is poorly acted with Rorschach bobbing his head like a power ranger. Especially Silk Spectre II obviously has no idea what acting is.<br/><br/>I've heard ""We didn't want to confuse the audience"" a lot during the making of this movie, but honestly, I think Zack was just confused. He looked at a brilliant piece of literature and thought ""HUH? WHERE IS ALL THE ELABORATIVE AND UNNATURAL DIALOGUE AT? HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND THIS BOOK IF THEY DON'T EXPLAIN THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST RIGHT AWAY?""<br/><br/>The endless adaptations and remakes are annoying, but at least most of them don't just butcher the actual concept. This is just Zack Snyder saying he's above a brilliant writer, saying Hollywood is better than literature.<br/><br/>7.9? Grab the novel, read it through, watch it again, THEN you'll know what you're talking about. I'll never accept anyone calling this film good or even decent without realizing how poor it is in comparison."

I never read the comic books in which this was inspired, but I can easily see why many fans of the original comic hated this movie: This tries too hard to be a ""realistic"" and ""edgy"" depiction of what would be if superheroes exist in the real world, but it ends being just boring, pretentious and stupid.<br/><br/>Everything from this movie fails: From the terrible, ugly CGI overload to the dumb and boring characterization. The performances are awful. The characters are annoying and uninteresting. The story and the action scenes are completely lame, just like in the other movies directed by Zack Snyder. The music doesn't fit any single of the scenes and some parts of the story are so ridiculous, that for some moment I thought that this was directed by Uwe Boll.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" it's the worst superhero movie ever made. It was even worse than ""Catwoman"" and ""Elektra"". If you want to see a good superhero movie see ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Kick-Ass"", both much better than this atrocious film.<br/><br/>0/10"

","The gist: If you are not a die-hard fan of The Watchmen already, don't watch it.<br/><br/>This is definitely the absolutely worst movie I have seen. If not *the* worst, it's right up there. The characters are shallow, acting mediocre, dialogues empty and the fight sequences boring. There are some good scenes - the Vietnam war scene and the jail fight sequence with Rorschach come to mind. But these are scarcely enough to make up for the other atrocious 160 minutes that is Watchmen. <br/><br/>I confess: I have not read the book. But like some other reviewers here have pointed out, a movie has to stand by itself. Watchman fails to do that. Miserably. The fans of the book would no doubt enjoy the way in which their superhero characters have been brought to life. But I thought that the depiction of the characters was extremely shallow. The Silk Spectre, especially, does little else except copulate with the other male characters in between flashback scenes. When I think about it, the characters themselves (as the authors of the book originally developed them) are phenomenal, but the movie does a dismal job of accenting their intricacies. <br/><br/>The movie also attempts to be overly dramatic. The scenes where Dr. Manhattan goes off on his philosophical trips get extremely annoying after awhile. And the relentless onslaught of flashback scene after flashback scene deadens your senses soon enough. While the movie does touch upon some interesting moral issues, these are lost in the swirl of too many slow motion fight sequences and CGI bloated scenes. <br/><br/>To summarize, I think this could have been a fantastic movie that took a unique perspective on superheroes like ""The Dark Night"" did. But it does not. The most we could hope for from this movie? No sequel by Mr. Zack Snyder."
"sfolk-86","1","8","16","8 July 2009"," One of the worst superhero movie I ever saw
","First of all this is the superhero movie in an unprecedented way the heroes doesn't have super powers, and they don't save people but each and every one starts killing people and one of them does a mass murder in the heart of U.S to save the war b/w Soviet and US that never happened! Only one of them seem to have a super power after an accident and he is more reluctant to wear any clothes showcasing his genitals and sometimes appears with an underwear to the mercy of the people watching it!! Lets play the cause and effect game First the till peaceful Soviet union assembles an army near the US border in the wage of a nuclear war Cause: One of the super hero in order to save U.S! Effect: the Soviet doesn't wage a war but the superhero himself kills <br/><br/>most of the people in U.S AND you know what happens the Soviet union cannot stand the sight of their own pathetic people killing themselves and lends a helping hand!!!and through out the movie the director have shown the people and the so called superhero of America in a very bad light. For God sake if u don't like America get the hell out of here and for the sake of good god don't make movies like this because its only a matter of time that people are tolerating this.<br/><br/>I'm still surprised how it got such good ratings in IMDb it should have got 2stars(max) just for graphics of jon's genitals! the plot is so bizarde that u wish u couldv'e stayed at home even after an hour the director is yet to give introduction to all so called superheroes.<br/><br/>you know what this movie has superhero raping,killing people,and one of them manages to have sex with the daughter of his friend! i mean she is their only hope so they take turns in having sex with her first jon and next the other guy!!!!,and superheros killing their fellow superheros.You know when u wish that the movies is over soon then it is extended like something for 2hrs45min, this only kills u slowly. I was waiting till 2hr 44th min hoping that something will happen and nothing happens!. i think the director is trying to hide behind the fact that people who haven't read watchmen comic doesn't understand this movie so what do u expect to read comic book before going to this movie i mean so many superheros movies have emerged and movies like spider man made a huge impact what do u think everybody read spider-man comic book before going into the movie!! in an era like this where movies like darknight is made please don't make movies like this its a disgrace to all other SH movies.<br/><br/>Taking about the SH'S One of them wears a mask which has some kind of animation on it (bec the director might have thought ordinary masks are old fashioned) but he has nothing to hide behind the mask i mean people would kill him for his deeds but his only identification is his mask still he wears mask every time!!!! and the jon guy he can see the future, teleport and do hell a lot of things go to another universe but can't see one of his friend planning all these things and a bizzard explanation for this. the other guy is busy falling in love and one of them killed in the beginning itself and most of them dead. bad! worse!! worst!!!<br/><br/>GOD SAVE America AND DIRECTORS LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","Could the song choices have been any more obvious, blunt, and uninteresting in ""Watchmen""? The opening Dylan anthem actually worked OK I thought, and the montage of comic panel-like shots from the history of this alternate hero-corrupted universe was reasonably well done. The Comedian's death sequence, also not bad -- but by the time we get through this rather long but in many ways too-short and scattered film to the second Dylan song (in its iconic Hendrix rendition of course) I've had enough both of the ""duh, of course they'd pick that"" pop song choices, which had become emblematic of the ""tell, not show"" bluntness of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Right upfront I will state that I'm a huge fan of the comic, have read it half a dozen times over 23 years and regard it as certainly the most challenging and fascinating word on superheros that I've ever read - and I'll also state that I've seen neither of Zack Snyder's two previous films. So of course I've got my idea of how I'd like to see a film based on this work - or not see it - but I've got nothing against Snyder for trying. And he does try I think; maybe he doesn't deserve an A for effort, but I do think his heart was in the right place. Brain, not to sure of that. The film does manage to distill nearly all of the principal storyline from the comic into a reasonably coherent narrative - but that's about it. As others have mentioned, Snyder is often slavishly devoted to his source, to the point of exactly reproducing many sequences so that they really do look as if they've ""leaped off the page"". What he doesn't do though is create a narrative flow or really get into the complexity of the alternate-world vision and the ironic and parodic elements that make the comic both fresh and at the same time very backward-looking and critical of its medium. The fact that he can orchestrate a sex scene to Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" and seemingly be unaware of the absolute hilarity of the concept is only one standout moment amongst many, but the biggest problem I have with it as a whole is that the film just doesn't move. There's little if any sense of urgency here - sure, the characters talk like the world is ending, but everything from the dully constructed fight scenes to the flashbacks to the anticlimactic climax just feels like its constructed more to be stared at and admired than to make you feel anything or excite. Rorschach's attempted escape from the police for example just feels inevitable and by-the-numbers, a duplication of comic panels that work much better as - comic panels.<br/><br/>There are definitely positive aspects to the film, in fact overall I'd say the cast is (surprisingly, given his reputation) Snyder's biggest plus - well, the casting director probably deserves some props too. Not that everyone or even most of the cast are great, but even the weak links (Malin Akerman's Laurie, Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, and especially Matthew Goode's very weak and unbelievable-as-messianic-madman Ozymandias) aren't really terrible and most of them seem to have at least a bit of commitment. And the strong performances by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Comedian), Patrick Wilson (Night Owl) and especially Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach) go a long ways towards making the film watchable. Haley in particular is a standout, virtually duplicating the character note-for-note from the comic and yet really getting some feeling into it, making even the lines that really don't come off well cinematically feel, well, human and natural. His death scene actually gave me a tiny emotional moment, not an easy thing to do in a film so devoid overall of real humanity or emotional power; if this film had come out in December I'd very much like to think he'd be up for some awards, but as it is I doubt he'll be remembered by the end of the year, given how much of a flop this is turning out to be.<br/><br/>And some of the set design (the Archimedes, the Martian sequence) was fine - not that Snyder is doing much beyond replicating the comic in this case. What he and the other creative people behind the scene really failed to do, in a nutshell, was to create anything really cinematic in their interpretation. A filmed comic that is devoid of much of the underlying subtleties that made it so great as a comic - in particular the basic storyline, which as I said is coherent, but really doesn't have anything like the complexity or fascination, the revelatory aspects that the original work has - is just a bunch of pretty moving pictures. And given that the pictures, and the film, don't move and aren't shot in any kind of interesting way, what you're left at in the end is a few fleeting cool images, the intensity of Haley's Rorschach....and that's about it."
"pelsh4","1","8","16","7 April 2009"," Not a fan of the graphic novel? No need to watch the film...
","This is a movie clearly put together for the die-hard fans. The flashbacks and background information squeeze all the momentum out of it. To those unfamiliar with the graphic novel, the question of ""When is the main story line going to kick in?"" (or, better put, ""Why should I be watching this?"") remains unanswered 90 minutes into the film. The soundtrack is clichéd and unnecessarily sentimental, and as such does not lend itself to the political edginess of the characters/plot. Mark my words, the 8.0 rating 'Watchmen' currently enjoys will drop once a wider audience has had the misfortune of seeing it. The hardcore fans and 'hypists' are the ones who've contributed to its artificially high score..."
"accountcrapper","10","8","16","14 March 2009"," Excellent
","I liked it a lot. Different from all the other movies. The only reason I can think Alan Moore did not put his name to the movie is because Alan Moore writes comics not film scripts and Alan Moore is fairly string in that conviction. <br/><br/>People who say the comic is better are kind of getting Alan Moores point. The graphic novel will always be better. In many ways the main central character to an Alan Moore comic is Alan Moore... kind of like how PK Dick is the central character of a PK Dick novel. <br/><br/>The film looks stunning... I mean stunning. The opening sequence is unreal. In the comic there are little sections of 3 or so pages of text... giving background or breadth to the story. The sequence at the stand and various points throughout are like that.<br/><br/>Some things I didn't like. I thought it was too short. I had no idea how long it was before or after I got to the cinema. Time stopped while I was watching it. I would like to see an extended directors cut come out on DVD. I understand it was already long enough for cinema but it wouldn't matter at home. The pacing in parts could do with being given a little more time.<br/><br/>The ending which I will not speak of deviates from the comic. It makes more sense that the comic but I am not sure if that is a good thing or not. Possibly if there was an extended DVD version we could have the option of both endings.<br/><br/>Loved the film, loved the comic, loved the way it looked, the way it felt. Wished it was longer... that my only real complaint."
"jmasur49","3","8","16","8 March 2009"," Never read the book
","As someone who never read the book, the movie really made no sense. There was no back story to explain where the characters came from, save Dr. Manhattan. Did they all acquire superpowers just by putting on costumes? The movie alluded to criminals having the same powers. Why? Why did Dr. Manhattan sometimes wear clothes and sometimes not? Why did Adrian say Manhattan didn't have feelings, when all he did was wallow in angst? Although there were some good action sequences, most of the movie was the characters agonizing over the fate of the world and then deciding, ""What the hell, let's do something."" Even the action was simply the good guys able to do anything with a few ninja moves, and the bad guys unable to do anything. Fifty armed cops trying to take down one guy and no one can pull a trigger. Come on! This movie doesn't stand on it's own."
"jonathan-s-baker","5","8","16","7 March 2009"," If you have or had not read the book this film is boring.
","I enjoyed parts of this movie. Having read the book there were parts that I had anticipated seeing on the big screen. In most cases the movie totally succeeded with a faithful jump from comic book page to movie screen. Even the changes that were made were understandable given that giant tentacled vagina monsters may not have mass appeal.<br/><br/>The book is not an action adventure story but more of a detective story filled with complex symbolism and detailed character development. The film is stripped of much of the complexity that makes the book worth revisiting time and again.<br/><br/>Action scenes from the book are given more importance than the story. This is pretty weird too because there aren't that many action sequences in either. The action sequences are given a strange and contrived feel as they are bogged down by heavy use of unnecessary slow motion and constant snap shot style posing by the characters.<br/><br/>The Villain came off as more villainy than I expected or than he appeared in the book. I mean I know he was cold in the book but he was a little sympathetic and approachable in the book. In this I pretty sure my buddies picked up on who the bad guy was pretty early on in the film. Probably as soon as he stood with facing away with his arms behind his back in James Bond villain fashion. \ The story crawls pretty slowly. The guy next to me fell asleep for most of the three hours. My friends who had not read the book expected more action. Also they were thrown by the amount of penis in the movie. Which is pretty faithful to the book."
"siyamaksordes","3","8","16","6 March 2009"," Wait for the DVD
","Unless your rental store is just as expensive as a ticket to the movies, I would really avoid this one. I personally have not read the comics, but know the general story behind it as I have a friend who has read them. When I heard it, I was genuinely interested. so I decided to go ahead and see the movie with my friend. Unfortunately it turned out to be quite a let down.<br/><br/>The thing that stood out as being the worst possible thing in the movie was the musical score. Songs that don't match the scenes at all regularly occur within the film. They often sound as if they were in an entirely different mood. The songs themselves do not have much in common, and also sound rather varied and different with no unified theme.<br/><br/>The next thing would be character interaction and drama. This movie has quite a bit of character drama... and it all comes off rather horribly. Dr. Manhattan seems to be in a depressed state and cannot tell the difference between reality and whatever he sees in the vast universe. The Silk Spectre breaks up with John, then sleeps with the Owl within a matter of days. Though at least in that case something leads to it, unlike a later scene in an airship which comes out of no where and was not really necessary and does not advance any plot or relation at all. The Comedian is just an immoral superhero who wouldn't get away with the crime he pulls back in America when killing civilians for fun because they protested superheros. The Owl is probably the only character people are really expected to familiarize with... if you were the nerd who never got any and idly stood by as you let your superhero comrade run around shooting innocents (the Comedian of course.) Rorschach is... well, plain and simple, he's a freaking nut case. Due to a poor childhood and after beating down some of his bullies he somehow comes to the conclusion all the criminals need to be beaten to a pulp. Then after doing a rather sick and twisted case, he decides all criminals should be killed outright regardless of what they might have done. It's like a bad soap opera on crack.<br/><br/>Speaking of entirely out of place, let's talk about the gore. I have no problem with gore, you want limbs flying in every direction, that's fine with me. However, the movie uses it horribly. It only shows up every once in awhile as if it were an afterthought, usually in scenes that involve Rorschach. This includes Rorschach slamming a cleaver into someone's skull multiple times and another one where his actions lead to having a man's arm's cut off. While this is completely shown with gore and all, somehow when Rorschach dumps an entire vat of hot grease on a man, it looks like he just had a mixture of snot and gel dumped on him and isn't suffering from anything. Just screaming with gel on his face and upper torso. Likewise another man is shot in the head during the movie, and there's not much other than a drop of blood and some scabbing when you finally see his face.<br/><br/>While we're on the topic of imbalance, we might as well talk about Rorschach narration. The movie hops between the normal actors acting things out, and Rorschach suddenly narrating in descriptive, intellectual sentences that sort of mimics the old gumshoe feel but with a much darker flare. It's spotty at best and stops after the first 2 or 3 times, lasting for short periods. It looks as if they thought they might try narrating the whole story with Rorschach, then decided against it but kept a few parts in regardless. The reason for the narration is Rorschach journal of events, which plays a minor point in the roll of the movie.<br/><br/>Other smaller things I didn't particularly care for include Rorschach's voice which felt overdone with it's gravely tone. The CGI of Dr. Manhattan, especially that of his eyes, looks rather bad. His whole struggle with ""is life actually important"" and how he comes to his conclusion felt like a load of bull, and would never actually sway anyone with his previous mindset. He whines that he doesn't want to be involved with humans or stuck with them because they hurt him, yet part of the reason he hurts oh so much all goes back to him having an affair in the first place. Go cry me a river blue boy. Only 2 or 3 of the ""superheros,"" would even stand a chance of being realistically sanctioned by law enforcement or government at ANY point in time. It's really no wonder why people where protesting against superheros with ones such as these. Dr. Manhattan is the only one that is technically ""super,"" everyone else is just much more fit and better trained than the normal human (that's how the movie describes it anyways.) Yet somehow they are throwing people through bullet proof glass and taking on mobs of people like it's nothing. Never mind the fact that every bullet just happens to miss them and in the one case it does hit, it's because the hero somehow catches the bullet in a bullet proof glove WHILE AT POINT BLANK RANGE.<br/><br/>Now, once you look past all these things, you might see what COULD have been a good movie. The points the story is trying to convey about humanity is interesting. The fact it shows how world events are changed with the coming of superheros is also an interesting idea to think upon. If the movie weren't quite so half-baked it could have turned out really well. But it is half-baked, and as such, it sucks."
"wolftab-1","6","8","16","6 March 2009"," The Watchmen Has a Lot of Promise But Ultimately Can't Live Up to Expectations
","Zach Snyder's ambitious rendering of Alan Moore's brilliant graphic novel The Watchmen has a little something for everyone but left me ultimately dissatisfied. That isn't to say the film isn't visually stunning. It is, and considering Zach Snyder made 300, that aspect shouldn't surprise anyone. However, the film is not the socio-political, apocalyptic statement that I was hoping would bear some resemblance to the graphic novel on which it is based. There is a reason that Alan Moore refused to have his name associated with the film.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the complex, multi layered stories-within-stories plot is about an ex superhero who is murdered and one of his ex partners, a masked inkblot named Rorschach sets out to track his killer by trying to enlist his former superhero friends, who were known as Watchmen. The film is enjoyable to watch for the first 2/3 and then it descends into camp and clichéd dialogue and circumstance. Not unlike other comic book films. From an acting perspective, there are 2 standouts. Jeffrey Dean Morgan who plays the ironic and cruel Comedian and a really well portrayed sociopathic but justice bound Rorschach played by Jackie Earle Haley of Little Children. I found that the Rorschach character was the most short changed out of all of the em and he was my favorite. The cast also features: Malin Ackerman as the sexy but troubled Silk Spectre II (who is the unlucky girlfriend of Dr. Manhattan); Patrick Wilson as the awkward and shut in Night Owl II; Billy Crudup as the very Blue, time and space bending unemotional Dr. Manhattan; (excellent cgi on Doc, right down to being anatomically correct) and Matthew Goode as the smartest person in the world but at what cost, Ozymandias.<br/><br/>Each Watchmen's origin is explored, some more than others. They represent the anti-superhero. Completely distinct from Batman and Spider-Man. They are incredibly flawed and dispense justice as they see fit. Some Watchmen are no different from common vigilantes. The film, like the novel is set in an alternate reality in 1985. Where Richard Nixon is still president, the US wins the Vietnam War, with Dr. Manhattan's help and the threat of nuclear annihilation is close at hand with the Soviet Union. For the most part, this is one of the more faithful books to screen adaptations I have seen, but they made some major tweaks to the climax, which I didn't have too much trouble with but true fanboys will hate it. Some of the more memorable lines from the novel are featured which made me smile, especially from Rorschach. But the other characters appear wooden and their dialogue for the most part is uninteresting. Dr. Manhattan as in the novel for me is the most sympathetic character as he was a noted physicist who is turned into the blue doc, due to a experiment gone horribly wrong, where essentially his molecules are turned inside out, blown apart and then reassembled. But, along with the other Watchmen, I found I didn't have any feeling about any of them and their circumstances, as their stories were thrown together. Again, I can't fault Mr. Snyder or the screenwriter Alex Tse too much. This was a herculean feat that they pulled off, where many visionaries like Darren Aronofsky and Terry Gilliam failed. However, it plays too much to the crowd more interested in violence and sex than good characterization and even good acting. I can't count how many times I was asking the characters how they felt about their circumstance, particularly a scene involving Manhattan and Silk Spectre II on Mars. The only clarity came from Rorschach and Comedian. Kudos to Mr. Haley and Mr. Morgan in that regard.<br/><br/>Overall, fanboys, I predict will enjoy their long awaited masterpiece but will be ultimately disappointed. And for those who are unfamiliar with the novel will like it even less and will undoubtedly get lost in the intricacies of the plot."

","This had the potential to be amazing and, quite simply, it wasn't.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailers I was really hyped up! They looked amazing! This inspired me to read the book. It was not what I expected, but it was brilliant. But I couldn't see how it could work as a film.<br/><br/>Some parts seem to be taken directly from the book, which is great, but then there are added bits which are unnecessary and it misses parts that could be great! The best thing about this is Jackie Earle Haley's performance as ""Rorschach"". He is awesome! Exactly as the character should be! Probably the worst thing about this film was the soundtrack. The songs were mostly pretty silly choices. They made some scenes laughable, which ruined them. That was a great pity.<br/><br/>The film had some great things going for it, such as ""Rorschach"", ""The Comedian"" and some good special effects, but it had too many flaws. The soundtrack, skipping important parts, the pace, the lack of any real feeling, etc. These flaws kept ""Watchmen"" from being what it could, and what it should, have been.<br/><br/>In summary, this is an average adaptation and an average film.

The last thing we need is yet another cold-hearted gay villain who, in the end, is condemned to spend the rest of his life miserable and alone.

Then we are suppose to believe that the watchmen were ""super heroes"" back in the 1940's and now have major moral and psychological issues.

The movie makes the mistake of going through each of the ""superhero's"" biography and its takes forever for the movie to really get started. Then when it finally does you say ""is that all""? The 'superheroes"" are all disgusting, blood hungry and vengeful maniacs that would rather solve problems by killing people rather than by peaceful means and fulfill the movie's promotional tag line ""A world at peace. There had to be sacrifice."" Nonsense!!! A case in point is when the 2 ""nicest"" superheroes decide to go back to doing what superheros do, not because they have a deep desire to do good for mankind but because they want to get their jollies and have fun again.

","Goes down as one of the most miserable viewing experiences of my life.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder, the peddler of crap who inflicted ""300"" on an unsuspecting world three years ago, is at it again, and has made a movie even less watchable than that other one. Snyder's modus operandi as a director would appear to be taking silly material deadly seriously, and he creates pounding, monotonous and -- in the case of ""Watchmen"" -- disturbingly sadistic films. ""300"" at least had a camp sensibility, even if unintentionally, that was easy to make fun of. ""Watchmen"" is just thuddingly boring when it's not being whiny or revolting.<br/><br/>Set in an alternative version of the 1980s, ""Watchmen"" is about a group of former superheroes who were driven out of service by a public who no longer wanted their help. Though how exactly most of them were superheroes is never clear. Only one, Dr. Manhattan, a big blue cloud of radioactive material with killer abs, has special powers; everyone else is just really good at beating people up. The rest of the plot is nearly impossible for me to summarize, since there's so much of it and almost none of it makes any sense. I imagine only people familiar with the source material could tell you what this movie is actually about. All I know is that half of the film's interminable running time had gone by and I was still waiting for a plot, or even the beginnings of a point, to emerge.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" feels like it was written by an angry 13-year old who thinks it's cool to see the world as a cold and uncaring place but only because he's never known anything but comfort and shelter. It takes a petulant attitude about human nature and tries to convince us that humans are at heart cruel and sadistic. But really, the only person who comes across as sadistic is Snyder himself, whose gratuitous use of graphic violence borders on the pornographic. Snyder needs to understand that intelligent adults understand the impact of violence in the real world, and may not relish the idea of seeing a little girl's severed leg being torn apart by dogs, or the head of the man who killed the little girl hacked apart by a meat cleaver. Moments like these -- and there are far too many of them -- take on a life of their own and remove the viewer from the world of the film. It's very difficult to get back in, especially if the movie's no good to begin with.<br/><br/>The cast of actors, some of them very good in other things, should be embarrassed by the performances they give here, though I'd like to think it's not their fault. Billy Crudup, Jackie Earle Haley and Matthew Goode deliver all of their lines in an expressionless monotone (though Goode deserves points for doing so while looking exactly like David Spade). It falls to Patrick Wilson and the actress who plays Silk Spectre (I'm too lazy to look it up) to give me characters I came even close to caring about. I didn't care about them, really, because they're boring as hell, but they at least seemed to be playing human beings.<br/><br/>One shouldn't have to be familiar with the original graphic novel to appreciate the film -- the film's merits should speak for themselves. Unfortunately, they don't. Message to Zack Snyder: next time try making a movie that WASN'T first a graphic novel, and maybe you'll have better luck. Though somehow I'm doubtful.<br/><br/>Grade: F"

It is great to know so much about these people... if I were trying to hire them. I'm not so all I needed was a quick go and then move on. Most of it was completely out of sequence anyway. The plot?

Once you find out what it is, it was over.<br/><br/>On top of that most of the movie was nothing more than a superhero porn. And not even the good kind either. Half of it had the blue guy's penis flopping around all over the place. Wow... now my life is complete... I'm sorry to say that this movie was more than a colossal waste of my time. It was completely worthless except for the special effects. Even those were kind of iffy as well.<br/><br/>And who is the main character? I don't think that was ever figured out either. It starts with one, and ends up with like 15. I am sorry to anyone who saw this and liked it, hopefully it made some sense to you... but to the rest of us it was a waste of time and money. I have not seen a worse movie since Hulk, Spiderman, and Fantastic 4. Save yourself some money and see something good."

","THE WATCHMEN is a disaster. Relentlessly pessimistic brutal misogynist and silly, this supposed post-modern take on Lycra and rubber clowns who bounce about Manhattan maiming and bashing men and whacking women is a tedious repellent bore. It is almost 3 hours and in its bloated self importance and endless image borrowing from other sci fi nonsense, it becomes excruciating to watch for any and every reason that rolls through your head. Try this loony cinematic sci fi combo: DUNE + THE FOUNTAIN + BLADE RUNNER + TRANSFORMERS + BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED + some Lord Skeletor crap + COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK + THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN+ a Columbia serial of the 40s like THE PHANTOM + CAPTAIN MARVEL + STARGATE + WALL STREET ... it just becomes an endless parade of borrowed images from these films with ugly cruelties meted out relentlessly with bone smashing fights and vicious hatred of the female form. The OWL dude just looks like Hamish the gay Teletubbie and Billy Crudup's testicles put in a better performance than him as a whole. He is all nude and bright fluorescent blue and often seems to be searching for his underpants. At one stage he goes to live on Mars in a big clockwork toffee. The ultimate poof bad guy I think is called Adrian and has an art deco codpiece. He ends up somewhere in outer-space in a Styrofoam pyramid compete with a mangy pet and plastic Sphinxes. Jackie Earle Hayley acts better with a bag over his head because when it is removed all he can do is hiss a midget Clint Eastwood imitation from ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ. Every scene and character exists solely to display pulverizing violence or disgusting imagery of death decay urban ugliness weapons and brutality that is beyond belief. It is a failure rarely seen and I hope never again. It is like Tarantino's pervert version of the missing reels from BLADE RUNNER and STAR TREK. And Stephen McHattie!

","When I saw just how long this film was I nearly decided to give it a miss but I am glad that I didn't as the two hours forty minutes flew past. Set in an alternative 1980s where President Nixon is in his third term and superheroes exist. This is not a happy reality though; the superheroes have retired and for the most part are living ordinary lives assuming they aren't dead or insane and the world is in the brink of nuclear war as the Soviet Union prepares to invade Afghanistan. Against this backdrop 'The Comedian' one of the heroes is murdered. Another of them, Rorschach, is determined to track down the killer before any more of them are killed. As he searches we are introduced to the rest of his group of superheroes, known as The Watchmen; we are shown their back-stories as well as learning what they are up to now; Dr. Manhattan is working on an energy source with his assistant the beautiful Laurie Jupiter, Adrian Veidt is the world's most intelligent man and Dan Dreiberg is living a comparatively normal life. Their search will lead them into extreme danger as well as teaching them some things about themselves that they did not know.<br/><br/>I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this film; I really liked the film noir aesthetics such as the voice-overs and the consistently dark tone. These heroes may be super but many of them are not nice; in fact more then one of them are bordering on being sociopaths! There was a time when superhero films were for children; this certainly isn't as it includes some fairly extreme violence, swearing and even some sex and nudity. The acting was pretty solid throughout and the special effects were great; all to often the CGI used in action films looks too unbelievable but here I didn't find my suspension of disbelief broken even during the most impossible scenes. I can't comment on how true the film is to the original characters and story of the graphic novels as I haven't read any of them but as a stand-alone film I heartily recommend it."

Even with the lowered expectations, Zack Snyder seemed to do little with the material. It is as if he just pasted the comic in the pre-production room and said, ""We don't need a script or a storyboard"". The film doesn't create the swirling mass of humanity that crushes against individuality...IMHO, a very important element for the Watchmen's development and banishment. Zack leaves out so much of the contextualization that I wonder if he really understands anything of the historical back drop the comic was set against? I do understand after the studio's success with ""300"" their willingness to give him a huge budget, but $150 million? Isn't that excessive?"

","This is the best movie of 2009. It is right up there with Sin City(2005), and 300(2007). It really captures almost everything we enjoyed about the graphic novel. There where some changes, I'm not gonna say what they are. But the changes are not to big, other then that it stays true to the story.<br/><br/>Now the roles of Nite Owl 2(Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre 2(Malin Ackerman), The Comedian(Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and Dr. Manhattan(Billy Crudup), I believe where pretty easy to cast, not to mention Dr. Manhattan who is pretty much a CGI effect, and Nite Owl 2 looks like Batmans fraternal twin, and Silk Spectra 2 looks like the lovechild of Batman and Electra. But when I saw Jeffrey Dean Morgan in The Comedians outfit, it was like the character just walk off the page.<br/><br/>Now the role of Rorschach, the film noir dressed vigilante, wearing a white mask, that has black spots that keep changing shape, was probably the most difficult role to cast, they had to find an actor, who could embody the most popular character of the them all. They needed to find the right actor. And Jackie Earle Haley did it perfectly, when cameras started rolling he wasn't acting like Rorschach, he became Rorschach. Really bringing Rorschach alive on the big screen. Like the way Heath Ledger embodied The Joker in The Dark Knight(2008), Jackie Earle Haley did the same with Rorschach.<br/><br/>Watchmen changed the way we view superheros, very well done by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. And the film is perfectly directed by Zack Snyer(300). It also has great acting, and great action. But be warned this is not a movie for kids, in case they have not read the graphic novel. A great movie, you won't be disappointed."

","While reading through the various reviews and comments concerning this film, there has been only what I can consider a veritable deluge of positive opinions based on misunderstanding. This is not a ""Good"" movie. It is overly ambitious project for at best a third tier talent. Yes the effects look great and is well cast in general. Jackie Earl Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan create fully realized characters out of of a mess of a movie. Despite these positives, the film lacks a consistent tone which renders its downer ending inert.Too many times, you go WTF when there is a crazy tone shift in the movie (Example the music in Sex Scene). Other structural problems exists in lack of backstory and characters arcs. More troubling is the lack of cohesion between the various characters and story lines. This is due no doubt to the massive nature of the film, 6 major characters working over 45 years of US political history, not including all the political themes running throughout. It probably would have been better to stretch this film out over two or three other movies so that the entire story could have been told properly."

","I was completely hooked from the first page. Obviously, this, as is the cardinal rule with adaptations, particularly from one medium to the other, can never completely match what the source was. With that out of the way... this gets a remarkable amount of it right. Dr. Manhattan? Couldn't have been much closer. The Comedian? Just about spot-on. Rorschach? Basically so accurate that you need rather sensitive measuring equipment to find anything actually wrong with him here(Jackie Earle Haley... wow). At its best, this hits the mark with such a bullseye that it really barely gets better at all. This gets (some) crucial content and meaning from the books, too. In spite of a running time of about two and a half hours, it didn't lose me, in spite of knowing what was coming. This can boast astounding intensity, when it goes for such, and doesn't overwhelm by going too fast, either... the pace is impeccable. The plot is magnificent, with a couple of big changes made(and as expected, a lot cut out, there was no way to put that mass of material into a feature film length). The writing is great, the choosing and execution are masterful a large part of the way. Certain differences could be argued as being necessary to make this work, in this format. I'm not sure they are all good. There are clear opinions interjected. The acting is, with few exceptions(Akerman being a notable one of them), marvelous. The casting is quite nicely done. The action, the fight scenes, excellent, although it can perhaps be called unfitting to add more to them, and they sure did... but my gosh, it sure is amazing and entertaining to watch. The comics were mainly drama. The CGI is incredible. The stylization and visuals are immensely gorgeous and effective. This does elicit emotional responses, if maybe not as many as desired. The music is full of fantastic and interesting picks. The score is composed well. If one is familiar with the original, given that it is not entirely what Alan wrote(though it tries to be faithful, and often succeeds), you'll hopefully either enjoy this, or avoid it, realizing that you might not. If, however, you are not aware of it, this may confuse and not fully make sense to you(things range all the way from being over- to being under-explained). They made this bloodier/nastier. This has strong(and continuous) violence and harsh language(albeit fairly infrequent), and plenty of nudity/sexuality(at points, less covered than what viewers might be expecting), of varying tastefulness.

"gortx","Null","6","12","28 March 2009"," WATCHMEN - review of the movie and only the movie
","I haven't read the graphic novel, so I went into this as purely a movie to be viewed as a work unto itself.<br/><br/>It has ideas. Weighty ones. Ones that most blockbusters these days don't even attempt. It took courage not to ""update"" the story to the present and to nix Nixon (who, despite FROST/NIXON, is very far removed from the core audience, much more so than in the mid-80s when it was written).<br/><br/>I liked it's look for the most part. The effects were good, but nowhere near as spectacular as many would have it. But, to the uninitiated, it's an underwhelming mess. I can see why this has divided audiences and critics. Those familiar with the graphic novel or just ready to groove with the effects and action seem to have liked it, but others have been mixed. I am in the second camp. <br/><br/>The Dr. Manhatten storyline works in the main, and Jackie Earle Haley is the best thing in the film as Rorschach (though, at times, his part of the tale seems to come from a different place than the rest). But, the biggest problem, dramatically. are the performances of Malin Ackerman and Patrick Wilson. Dan, I assume is trying be diffident, but Wilson's performance just doesn't work. Ackerman fills out her suit nicely, but it all falls apart once she begins to speak. Their scenes together are performed like something that would appear in a straight to DVD release, not a huge studio film. And, the makeup on Ackerman is so caked on (even when not in costume) that you swear there would layers like rings on a tree if you scraped her face. Even that makeup job is better than the laughably poor ""old age"" appliances on Carla Gugino! Crikey, the comical Katherine Helmond plastic surgery makeup in BRAZIL looks more realistic!<br/><br/>But, as I noted, I didn't find the film totally without merit. But, ON FILM, WATCHMEN doesn't work. I also hadn't read V FOR VENDETTA, ROAD TO PERDITION or A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE and they were all good to very good FILMS. The key is not to be ultra faithful to the source (as many are applauding WATCHMEN for being), but to find a way to make the source material work dramatically on film - even to those who hadn't read the original material. <br/><br/>WATCHMEN fails that test.<br/><br/>******* SPOILERS***************<br/><br/>I understand that the ending is different in the novel. Here, you can't help but shake the notion that it would be a matter of a few months (a couple of years at the most), when nations would go back to being as they were before. Besides, if Dr.Manhatten is in ""another galaxy"" what exactly is the threat that would bind nations?"
"Cephyran","8","6","12","26 March 2009"," A visually stunning narrative that captures the novel almost page-for-page with passionate respect
","I read the graphic novel before seeing the film. In turn I went into the film knowing what I was about to see - a living embodiment of the story with an ending I already knew. In doing so I immediately found myself asking these questions upon the start and ultimately the entire way through the film: Will the narrative of the film respect the narrative my mind constructed as I read the novel? Will the shots structurally reflect the same visual craftsmanship of the novel in it's move from page to screen? To answer this, we have to grasp that the way your mind reads a book and watches a movie are two vastly different faculties. With a book - in this case, the graphic novel - your mind constructs the voices, the tone, the choreography and the pacing as a response to the static visual narrative. In films it's all done for you. Ultimately, I found myself able to recall the novel page for page as each scene progressed. Very little of the narrative is rearranged, and those elements that have been shuffled are structured in a way so as to make the character development happen smoothly for an audience that has not read the book. I think the cleanest and simplest way I can describe it is that everything necessary to the telling of this story has been included and everything unnecessary has been left out without damaging the final product. As far as capturing the true visual of the novel, I think the film was completely successful. It is one of those works where the novel itself would have been literally used as the story-boarding. Speaking strictly from the perspective of a comic book fan, one of our greatest desires in film adaptations is seeing how successfully the cast matches the look and feel of the characters. This is also near-flawless. If there is one difference it is in the women, but this is to be expected because from my experience women in comics are never drawn realistically - figures are too toned, too elongated, faces are sharper, and they almost always are overtly sexualized. Obviously, the genre demands it. And the film manages to capture that, the combination of grace, sexuality and strength in a real body and real costumes. Rorshach comes out exactly as I picture him in the novel - a gruff, Punisher-like force of violent vengeance, willing to go right to the edge to prove the ends never justify the means. The back story of his mask is not explained in the film, and it is one of those elements I would argue is it's own compelling detail in the novel, but is peripherally unnecessary in the film translation. <br/><br/>I don't believe you have to read the novel prior to seeing the film. Nothing structurally critical in the novel is lost on-screen. The establishing of the political climate and the superhero generations is done perfectly fine. What you get from the novel is the understanding of the minor details - characters you see momentarily in the film whose lives are fleshed out in subtle asides throughout the novel. The characters of the young man reading the comic by the news vendor, the vendor himself, the heroine Silhouette, and so forth - to the unknowing audience these are inconsequential elements resolved in a manner that balances their introduction; to the book-first audience, it's almost a little feeling of satisfaction, knowing more than what's shown, as if the character was played by a close friend, allowing you to lean over and say, ""See that police-man? That's my cousin."" Most importantly, what you take from the novel is knowing how it ends. This is one area of the narrative that was modified for the film. To have taken the ending exactly as it was written creates two problems. First, the literal ending would require greater extrapolation into all of those minor characters and side stories (the majority of which are in true essence erased from the film's script), thus creating a longer movie. Secondly, the literal ending I believe would have been an imbalance in the narrative - in the greater context of the film it would be asking too much for the suspension of the audience's disbelief.<br/><br/>I have to address the common observation of ""You have to read the book to appreciate the film."" What they're really saying is you have to know the details to appreciate the details left in and left out. I say appreciation must take two paths here: If you watch the movie first, you're likely to choose to appreciate the film simply for the cinematic art it is, and rank it next to others of the genre; if you read the book first you're more likely to appreciate it as an adaptation of a rich layered story, and draw the lines of comparison between the page and the screen. Taking these two perspectives I present my opinion. As a film, it is visually stunning, fairly well acted, and long in the same fashion that Dark Knight was long - you weren't watching the clock, you were watching the movie. As an adaptation, I feel it succeeded. I feel the filmmakers did everything in their power to respect the material at its core and it is successful for their doing so. Ultimately the biggest question is one nobody can answer due to the uncertainty paradox - does reading the book first in any way diminish the impact of the movie more-so than the inverse of this query?

","Many people commented that to understand the movie you have to read the book first. So I bought Watchmen, and read it in 5 days. And what can I say... It was the best story I've ever read. Period. Then I became obsessive over the movie and I kept begging my poor father to take me to the theater since I am underage. Not going into details, I saw the movie. And I have to say, that Zak Snyder adapted the comic beautifully into film. Unlike his last film, ""300"", Watchmen has great acting and excellent atmosphere. Rorschach will always be the most bad-ass and kick-ass hero of all time. The ending... While the ending was changed a bit in the movie, the ending in the novel paralyzed me. It was an ending that I never heard of. So if you love the novel, or you just love this dark setting of New York with all these bad-ass vigilantes, then... I'm sure your thoughts won't be that much different than mine. <br/><br/>10/10"

","...and thankful should we all be for that! Hadn't it been for the portrayal of Rorschach, this movie would unfortunately not have been much more than a waste, or killing, of time following the irregular and over-complex confusions of the characters as utterly few of these manage to catch the interest of the viewer: You need to not only have knowledge about the characters, but also know of the dark alleys of their minds to at all be able to appreciate the twists and turns of emotions.<br/><br/>The attempts to make the plot intriguing are admirable, but the result is inconsistent and confusing. The timelines and flashbacks add brief hints of what you're dealing with, but seamlessly crossed over with events of the present, they make little sense even for someone familiar with the story. <br/><br/>The seams, however, become more visible in other aspects. If nothing else, so at least to point out the apparent lack of time there was for explanations of ""how and why"", which further contracts the story to an incomprehensible muddle of irrelevance. For those not already engaged in the full story, this will add no further clarity but rather increase the rate of speculations.<br/><br/>This is a movie lacking of a solid beginning and end, which fairly follows the lines of Alan Moore's, but somehow it still got way lost in translation. <br/><br/>Still it is worthwhile watching. If nothing else, so at least for those rare moments of brilliance."

","So, sitting in the theater there were a couple of guys behind me complaining about this movie. They had the same complaints as many commentators on this site. And before praising this wonderful adaption of a brilliant piece of pop literature, I have to admit that I absolutely sympathize with anybody who can't wrap his or her head around this film.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago I saw ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and while watching ""Watchmen"" I felt a certain kinship between these two films. Both stories depend on the willingness to accept a pretty far-out premise.<br/><br/>In the case of ""Watchmen"", which is ultimately a collage of 20th century American pop culture, the viewer is asked to confront the myths of superheroes as a jump-off point for a meditation on life and all it's physiological and psychological entanglements. Which is really something rather high-browish.<br/><br/>25 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons took (as Gibbons once stated) their love for superheroes to a human level. They saw the flaws in our actions as essential to our existence as our fortitude, which leaves the the reader or the audience with an array of questions to ponder.<br/><br/>From one Dylan song at the beginning to another one at the end, a visual firework and outfitted with a strong ensemble, director Zack Snyder takes a dense and very faithful adaption to those emotional levels that very few comic-adaptations are able to go to. Last years ""The Dark Knight"" widened the canvas of what a comic could be (something we nerds always knew), now ""Watchmen"" explodes it.<br/><br/>Back to the guys sitting behind me. One of them said that this would be the last comic-movie he would go see. Well, if there was never another comic-adaptation to be, this would be a perfect last addition."

","Superhero fans are not a united front. We all have different tastes of what we like in superhero movies. Some of us want a lot of action and a half hour battle at the end, some just want the scenes and the characters to look cool, some want a solid story. Because of this, it's not too much of a surprise to find such different in opinions about this film where paying attention to the plot is so important.<br/><br/>Compared to the graphic novel, this film stands well. While most movies I grumble about things left out, for this one I was surprised about how much made it in! Really, for the other commenters who claim to have read Watchmen and still think this was still terrible, I wonder if they read any of the words next to the pretty pictures. With very few bumps this movie covers the entire plot rather well.<br/><br/>As a stand alone movie for the people who haven't picked up Watchmen, it also holds its own very well - but you have to pay attention. If you're the sort who wants to just watch what's on the screen and not think much about the plot, then this movie isn't for you - and neither is the graphic novel, probably."

","Excruciating movie. Long, tiresome, and a bore.<br/><br/>Weak acting and lifeless characters limit what might've been a promising message. Since the story lacks palpable emotional impact - learning the parentage of one ""hero"" is supposed to be more climactic than the destruction of most of the world's big cities, for instance - the desperate director repeatedly resorts to the sound of bones cracking and the sight of them splintering through skin to impress the audience. There's only so much bludgeoning I can take. And the Koyaanisqatsi soundtrack (Philip Glass) was only too apt; yet another reminder that this was a long, pointless journey to nowhere. In the end, I felt like Dr Manhattan - I didn't care about these people, this universe, or what any of it had to say.<br/><br/>And worst of all, this movie was no fun at all."

The song that was chosen for the opening credits was well chosen and worked perfectly with the movie.<br/><br/>The movie version of Watchmen takes the graphic novel's sequence of events and puts it in a different order. My only guess for doing this is because for anyone that is seeing the movie that's never read the book it will make it for easier understanding.<br/><br/>With the economy so bad right now Watchmen hit me in a different way. The story made me wonder is their really Watchmen out there watching us without our knowledge. Seeing it made me happy and sad because it wasn't your typical movie or story.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was phenomenal and everything else was terrific. Watchmen isn't just another superhero movie like Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, etc. It's completely different movie.<br/><br/>Watchmen isn't for kids because its really gory, and it has nudity in it.

Only my humble opinion, but it is not often I dislike something as much as this, it just doesn't seem to have translated well, and I was expecting something with the excitement and beautiful visuals of 300 or Sin City but it wasn't, even the costumes were crap, superhero movies have big shoes to fill since the Dark Knight : )"

","I never read the comic so I went in completely cold. After seeing it, I have even less of a desire to read the comic than I did before I saw it.<br/><br/>None of the characters or plot lines engaged me on a human level in the way The Dark Knight, Sin City, or the Spider-Man films did. In fact, I actively disliked every character and had not a care in the world whatsoever if any of them lived, died, achieved their goals, failed to achieve their goals or anything else. I agree with Rorschach when he criticizes Dr. Manhattan for making the entire movie unnecessary. The film is also extremely violent, which I guess is part of the book, but I wasn't prepared for it. Conan is right when he says its closer to Saw than Spider-Man. The ads make it look like X-Men or something.<br/><br/>I didn't think Watchmen was particularly insightful when it came to matters spiritual or scientific. The two most philosophical conversations both take place on Mars; one is kind of an Ecclesiastes-lite and the other is a sort of post hoc ergo propter hoc explanation of what the film considers a ""miracle.""<br/><br/>On the other hand, the visuals are extremely impressive. I know some people didn't like the compositing and animation of Dr. Manhattan, but I couldn't disagree more. Overall, I'd give the movie a 10 out of 10 on the production level and a 4 out of 10 on a story level."

","I got nervous during the opening credits with the number of times that I saw Zack Snyder's name. I was questioning wether or not I should watch this movie. Unfortunately, I made the decision to watch it all the way through. That was a mistake.<br/><br/>This movie is way too long, most of it is underdeveloped, and there are too many subplots. There are interesting ideas present, but the don't spend enough time on anything for it to actually develop and become interesting. As a result, there are a handful of good moments surrounded by boring nonsense.<br/><br/>This movie is unnecessarily dark. I'm not even talking about how melodramatic everything is, and how nearly every death has to be artsy and bloody, most of the movie takes place at night. I don't know why. It makes it hard to see some scenes. The movie doesn't look bad, but its definitely trying to be edgy - and not necessarily in a good way. Most of the effects look pretty good though, I'll give it that.<br/><br/>The dialogue is pretty bad. Noone will answer other peoples questions or respond in the way a human would. They just respond with a lengthy, unrelated, philosophical speech. All the characters do this. I'm ok that Doctor Manhattan does this, as he isn't very good at communication, but everyone does this. Also, most of the characters are pretty underdeveloped, not just the plot.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is really unsatisfying and really really boring."
"karimadada","10","4","7","29 August 2016"," A transcendent movie
","To say Watchmen is a great movie would be an understatement. I have just recently seen this movie's ultimate cut and I must say it is by far my favorite movie. The most short-lived 3.5 hours of my life.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a graphic novel that is not for the simple- minded. It is dark in nature and reaches depths filmmakers avoid sharing with the general audience. And by depths I mean mature themes and revealing truths. It has a unique paradoxical taste to it: beautiful yet cynical, and that is the real reason it stands out.<br/><br/>I have yet to find a movie that captures so masterfully the different shades of life as we know it. It manages to combine the smallest of details with great precision and the biggest of ideas/themes with striking clearness and honesty and delivers the combo into a beautiful end product. To put this into example: we see in the movie the real nature of humans and the atrocities we are truly capable of, yet we are introduced to some of the most idealistic and platonic characters in comics history. Only to realize that we cannot help but relate to both. Another example of how complex this movie is.<br/><br/>And who better to direct such a rich movie than visionary director Zack Snyder himself. Snyder clearly poured his heart out into the movie as he dazzles the world with some of his best scenes yet, which is an impressive achievement considering his acclaimed status as a visionary director. Some scenes are literally breath-taking as they deliver superb visuals backed up by an absorbing score. To explore the intricacies of the comic is a challenge on its own. But to capture them and deliver them with such raw power and purity is a special accomplishment. After all, this is the reason why many have considered this graphic novel to be 'unfilmable'. Exceptional work indeed by Snyder.<br/><br/>To sum it up, if you want a movie that will make you feel and think and everything in between, Watchmen is the movie for you. Just remember that it is dark and deals with themes more appropriate for the heavy-thinkers."

The only reason to see the film is so that you too can then come onto I. m. d. b. and type your own honest review. An honest review being one such as this is letting people know just how bad the film is! The plot line is incredibly confusing. There are sub-plots that have absolutely no reason to be in the film at all. The characters are all exceedingly bland and extremely boring, so bland and boring that I have tried numerous times to watch the film and every time I have fallen asleep! The script is completely dreadful and the acting is almost as bad! The film is a very long, very drawn out. At two hours and forty-two minutes long at least one hour could be cut and the plot line still wouldn't make any sense but it would mean an hour less of your life wasted watching this turd! Better still, as I have been there and done it already take heed of what I and all of the other reviewers that have given it a 1 star rating have typed about this film.<br/><br/>I'm not in the slightest bit surprised it made a loss big loss in takings at the box office after it's time on release was over! <br/><br/>(why do reviews such as this one ALWAYS get buried (come after) behind loads of amazing ones that all have high-stars (6-10 stars) ratings just because it is a low-starred review?

"withnailian","10","4","7","13 September 2012"," A Perfect Example of The Superhero Genre
","Firsts things first for this review, I watched this film a few months ago and at the time had never read the book. I was recommended this film by a friend who is obsessed by the book and film alike, and I must say I was very skeptical of this title for two main reasons;<br/><br/>1.) The trailer didn't really sell it for me, mainly as it didn't really give an insight to the story and seemed more interested in showing the effects to create Dr. Manhattan.<br/><br/>2.) Judging by the quality of most Superhero Films (e.g. Green Lantern, Spiderman, X-Men, Hulk etc.) I didn't expect much. Probably just having a casual disregard for the comics back story, instead having more focus on lame catchphrases and dull set pieces to hope a few drones will recognize the name half-heartedly and be willing to give up a few pounds for 2 hours or so of mind numbing boredom.<br/><br/>How wrong was I. I was very impressed by almost every aspect of this film, particularly the way it swaps between genre to genre; having noir- detective qualities for the scenes with Rorschach, typical superhero standards for the back story of Dr. Manhattan, to surprisingly real feelings of inadequacies and feeling of worthlessness with Nite Owl. This mix of genres blended together superbly, creating a film that can be watched by anyone.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast are excellent, particularly Rorschach, played perfectly by Jackie Earl Harley, who gives the very complex and difficult character with style, poise, and even having a few truly heartbreaking moments. Patrick Wilson was excellent as the insecure Nite Owl, Billy Cruddup gives a perfect monotonous genius to the difficult Manhattan and Jeffrey Dean Morgan creates a truly terrifying yet reasonable Comedian. Even model Malin Akerman gives a good turn at the pretty generic Silk Spectre. The only real let downs in the cast is Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, who just isn't as physically powerful and domineering as his ""perfect"" character should be.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack for the film, like almost all the elements of the film, is superbly done, right down to the haunting opening montage to Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" to ""The Sound of Silence"" playing in the funeral scene, to Jimi Hendrix's cover of ""All Along The Watchtower"" in the penultimate scene. I can think of very few films, particularly made in the last few years, which have a soundtrack as superb as this one, blending, like the comic itself, popular culture and science fiction.<br/><br/>After reading the comic for the first time, I believe people do not truly appreciate the masterpiece that Snyder has created with Watchmen. He has created a film which follows the comic nearly frame for frame, something which is rarely achieved by a film of this calibre. Whilst Alan Moore may view his truly excellent comic masterpiece as elitist over Watchmen in the medium of film, I believe that Snyder has created a deeply complex and riveting Action Film that should take high ranks amongst Superhero films and the medium of Film itself."
"Wuchakk","10","4","7","10 June 2012"," The ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films
","Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, 2009's ""Watchmen"" takes place in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. A former masked crimefighter named The Comedian is murdered, prompting his previous teammates to investigate the crime. Things get complicated as the backstories of most of the Watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.<br/><br/>For some reason I was never interested in the Watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though I had the opportunity. Why? The fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members, which Moore intended as satire, I later discovered. That said, this is mind-blowing. ""Watchmen"" is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. The latter two score high marks with me any day.<br/><br/>Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and extreme right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. He's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. The character was based on Steve Ditko's The Question.<br/><br/>The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of The Punisher, if he were a jokester. Unfortunately, The Comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.<br/><br/>Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on Batman or Blue Beetle. Unlike the previous two he's very likable. I always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan (Greg Plitt), named for the Manhattan Project and based on Captain Atom with a dash of Mr. Fantastic, is an almost God-like being who can do pretty much anything. He's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, Silk Spectre II. He'd rather hang out on Mars -- literally! <br/><br/>Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention Akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. The character was based on Phantom Lady and Black Canary. Silk can't handle Dr. Manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to Night Owl for human warmth.<br/><br/>Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino) is Silk Spectre II's mother and has a pretty significant part. Like her daughter, she's hot, albeit in a whole different way.<br/><br/>Ozzyosbourne, whoops, I mean Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on Charlton Comic's Thunderbolt. He's ultra-smart, ultra-quick and kinda foppish.<br/><br/>Another highlight is the hypnotic score by Tyler Bates mixed with a quality soundtrack (e.g. ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""All Along the Watchtower,"" etc.)<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: The film is long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. No moronic ""blockbuster"" trash here. Not to mention Silk Spectre II and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. As far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like ""Watchmen."" It's even more atypical than the X-Men and easily one of my favorite superhero flicks, maybe even THE favorite. ""Watchmen"" is like the ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films!<br/><br/>RUNTIME: Theatrical Cut: 162 minutes; Director's Cut: 186 minutes; The Ultimate Cut: 215 minutes <br/><br/>COMPARING CUTS: I own both the theatrical cut and Director's Cut. Although the theatrical version is just fine, the DC is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on Night Owl's Mentor, Hollis Mason, at the hands of a thug gang and Night Owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. Despite the convoluted plot, I had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though I've never read the graphic novel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version, so to speak. So don't think you'll need to purchase the DC to understand the story; it's not necessary. My recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the DC if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me. Even so, I PREFER the theatrical cut; it's leaner and just all-around better. <br/><br/>GRADE: A"

","Impressive, intelligent, layered, rich in metaphor and subtext...and oddly boring. I don't know what it is about Watchmen. I never read the comic, so maybe that's why I didn't get it...? It should have been great for provoking after viewing conversation, but afterward I just didn't want to think about it. It starts great, but goes off kilter somehow, like a rhythm that goes out of sync 1/2 way into a song, and the further it goes the more obvious the off beats become. Then comes the point you just can't enjoy it anymore. But the concept was great. Amazingly clever play with hero archetypes, and the social and political statements suggested in the blurred distinctions of right and wrong. It's challenging in that regard, but dominated by a meandering sort of cerebral pomp, especially in Rorschach's Noir style monologues; and the white angst evoked in the 'Noble Lie' conclusion. The only stereotypes that remained intact were the bad guys, who could have been plucked from any generic superhero fantasy. For a film so complex it embraced some pretty 'central casting' social memes. Perhaps I am just taking it too seriously, but that's the way it was presented. And if a virtually omnipotent being like Dr Manhatten can't enjoy life... then why live? Friends have been recommending this for a long time. I finally got around to viewing it. It was impressive film and I really should have liked it, but... maybe it was just too long?"

","This is a different kind of movie on heroes. Whenever think about heroes and their powers, all I could have in my mind is saving the earth, defeating villains, winning peace and love. But for Watchmen, everything is disrupted and blurred. It's apocalyptic and tragic on the one hand, and very human or even subhuman on the other. Heroes who are supposed to help people are not able to do it due to their individual reasons. The world is getting dark and desperate, and heroes are getting to lose powers.<br/><br/>Watchmen is very huge and enormous, because it deals with many prominent events in human history. It is even philosophical, and makes people think about human beings themselves. <br/><br/>The best character for me is Rorschach. I don't know exactly why, but I am just attracted to him. I guess it is because he is only right one in this movie, although he is considered freak and weirdo all the time. What he says and shows in his journal always impresses me a lot. Rorschach is my all time favorite hero ever. Also, I really like Jackie Earle Haley's performance. He is a great actor. His voice and every step he makes were Rorschach itself. <br/><br/>After watching the movie Watchmen, I read the original graphic novel. I think both movie and novel are great.

","** 1/2 (out of 4) By Aaron Dumont <br/><br/>An odd type of noble, embalmed experience that all but transcends, falls beneath and remains firmly aligned with the superhero movie norm, Zach Synder's Watchmen has remained a curiosity to me. <br/><br/>The opening of the movie was a dizzying, glorious promise to a possible masterpiece from a director who had previously made only watchable horrors and asinine high-art-masquerades. The first 10-or-so minutes illustrated a brief, ravishing odyssey through recent history under the influence of superheroes. Acted through a series of tableaux, it all felt much like an experience. It was a perfectly constructed space, full of form and texture and set to Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin. <br/><br/>Afterwards, the movie roughly runs through the next two-and-a-half hours, grasping and losing the brilliance it started out with. It grows more and more with characters and plot, ripens with great potential, and sprawls in detail and complexity - it's too bad the inspired structure can't handle it. It all becomes a bit too unwieldy for its own good, ending up as a philosophical epic that leaves me cold. It is a movie rich with poetry and disillusionment, albeit one that doesn't know what do with it all. <br/><br/>Something that also struck me during my viewing was the borrowed, stitched-together feel of the movie. It had an unpolished effect that, to a certain degree felt a bit casual. The images and senses triggered were astonishing, but felt much like a carbon-copy of the original graphic novel. This bogged down the message, the approach and the humanism of the whole product. Perhaps it was the ending that truly got to me - under a saturated sky, exactly like in the comic, a young man working at a newspaper office, finds the journal of Rorschach's journal, and the words that began both the film and the journal are read from it. Finish the movie. Fade to credits. The end. <br/><br/>I don't know about you, but it felt simply underwhelming - an all-too-light, all-too-easy route to cut off the movie and make it easy to digest. It was something that made the past events and themes - disenchantment, moral crisis, loneliness, alienation, mortality, decaying politics - seem so less grim, so less real. It was a screaming reminder that what you were watching was merely some fiction. This was theatre. It was Hollywood. <br/><br/>I felt I was watching a masterpiece trapped in the shell of an average, everyday crowd-pleaser. Watchmen was a glorious effort, but an oddly unsatisfying watch. Maybe it was simply trying too hard to film the 'unfilmable' comic series. Overall, it's a mixed bag - a great movie listlessly stumbling about. <br/><br/>Where has all the liberation of cinematic adaptations gone?"
"blackbrown","3","4","7","28 July 2009"," Snyder proves he has nothing to offer beyond visuals
","As comic book movies have become more and more popular over the last decade or so, there has been a push to make them more ""adult"" in the sense that the audience can take the ""drama"" of the movies seriously. Of course, the standout example is ""The Dark Knight,"" a movie many don't consider an action movie at all, but rather a ""crime drama."" Regardless of what people think of TDK, it is a movie that truly transcended the comic book fan - many people were interested in it, and dare I say pleased with it, who would never be interested in seeing the latest X- Men, Spider-man, Watchmen, etc. Putting comic book fans, and Alan Moore fans, aside, there is a general attitude towards comic book movies that they are something to be taken with a grain of salt - no matter how serious they may be or how much they have ""grown up"" while making the transition from page to screen.<br/><br/>Snyder is a true example of the MTV generation at work, and an example of how truly shallow this generation can be. ""Watchmen"" very badly wants to be an intellectual thriller driven by drama and acting more so than action - and it fails miserably.<br/><br/>This is a long movie. It is at its best when it turns into a music video, which is often. There are no flaws visually, but it is impossibly hard to take this story seriously (of course, Moore has to take some credit for that). The overall plot is not very sophisticated, despite the movie believing desperately that it is, and the drama just cannot be taken seriously. Imagine if Sam Raimi believed that emotional scenes between Tobey MacGuire and Kirsten Dunst were the most important aspect, and the aspect audiences most cared about, in Spider-man and you can pretty much imagine what this movie is about.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, it's dumb, which is 100% okay, but if Snyder just embraced this and carried himself like the ""all visuals, no substance"" director he truly is, this may have been a great movie. It's worth ""seeing"" this movie, but it would probably be more interesting as background visuals at a rave party than as an actual movie worth sitting down to watch. At least in that context, you might be spared Snyder's sad attempt to pretend he is Martin Scorcese and all the classic rock that serves as movie music, which only proves Snyder is a person that throughout his life has merely bought what is sold to him, but somehow thinks he is now a profound artist.<br/><br/>Good fight scenes, when they actually happen."

So I wasn't versed in the mythology in which it was set, but that was very nicely summed up in the first 15 or so minutes of the film. Secondly this was quite possibly one of the dullest superhero films ever, probably on a par with Hulk. Third major point with the exception of Dr. Manhattan not a single one of them possesses a single superpower, unless you count Rorschachs mask (which can change its image like the test its named after which in itself is about as useful as turning into an orange). They're all retired by an act of government and the world is on the brink of war, so they decide to try and stop it, in the meantime someone is trying to kill them all and is hunting them down, so far so who gives a frig? The characters are so underdeveloped and two dimensional that you end up not caring what happens. Rorschachs voice acts as narrator and my god is it annoying, he's gone for the ""batman angry voice at all times because if i speak gruffly then everyone will fear me"" thing, can someone just give the man a strepsil or some sort of lozenge? The film takes an absolute age to get going and then speeds along at a snails pace, occasionally livening things up with a fight sequence but that's it. The ending, without giving it away, is absolutely pathetic. Turns out there's a traitor in their midst and he's brought about the end of the world in order to save mankind. Eh? Did I see that right? you may be asking. the answer is yes you did and I had trouble when i saw it in the film. It was this at this point I realised I had sadly wasted 2 and a half hours watching this. Would I watch it again? probably yes. would I recommend someone else to watch it? no."

","I did not read the comics but I did come with open mind to see this film and perhaps high expectations based on reviews and user ratings. But what a disappointment! The plot is terrible, action is boring, with few scenes of unnecessary raw violence and meaningless philosophy. It has its tries to develop an interesting plot, but each time fails getting somewhere.<br/><br/>The acting is average, and every actor seems that it tries to much. And this is for me the overall image of this film, trying to much to accomplish a great symphony. But in the end just manage to leave noise in my head and the bitter taste of disappointment.<br/><br/>So hey super heroes fellows run to see it, this film is just for you (only)."
"TKoote","10","4","7","7 March 2009"," Delivers different than expected
","I went to see Watchmen today with high expectations and I haven't read the comic since I wasen't even born when it was first published. I really thought this would be the best blockbuster of the year, but it doesen't turn out to bee a blockbuster. Instead, it delivers on almost every other front.<br/><br/>The story is complicated but amazing and very very deep. You really have to be alert every second of the film to understand the next twist in the plot. The producers changed the ending of the comic in a new ending and I really can't understand why this isen't the end of the comic. Thats the biggest compliment I can give! The actors were good although Marilin Akerman was a bit disappointing. You really can't ignore the fact that she was casted for her beautiful looks, instead of her acting. The main part of the film she plays well but when it starts to get more intense, or emotional, she fails to convince you. A shame because she plays one of the most interesting characters.<br/><br/>The star of the show however is Jackey Earle Haley. He play's Rorschach, a tormented psychopath with a textile ""face"". Rorschach investigates the murder on The Comedian, one of the former Minutemen and Watchmen. Rorschach immediately thinks that someone is trying to kill all of the former superheroes.<br/><br/>There is only one person however, which has superpowers and that's Dr. Manhattan. As a result of a accident during a scientific experiment, he can teleport, make himself enormously big and change the substantion of materials. Dr. Manhattan is a fully CG character but most of the film you don't realize that. What plays a big part in that is that Dr. Manhattan glows blue, so the animators didn't have to precisely reproduce all the lighting in the set. This blue guy is one of the mayor philosophic characters and sometimes you want him to shut up and do his magic. But when you think about his part in the story after wards you're glad he didn't. I'll explain in a few moments.<br/><br/>The last two main-characters are Night Owl and the superhero with the most ridiculous name ever; Ozymandias. Those two people are almost the exact opposite. Night Owl is someone who's afraid of the suit he's wearing and has a low sense of self-assurance. Ozymandias however is an arrogant prick who loves being the worlds smartest man, and turned his Watchmen-image into a wealthy industry.<br/><br/>I forgot one person, the victim, The Comedian. In the first shot of the film you see he's brutally murdered and the ongoing of the film increasingly want's you to know who's done it. The big reason for this seems to lay in the fact that he played a big part in the outcome of the Vietnam-war, together with Dr. Manhattan. So was it a political killing, or is someone really picking on costumed-heroes? The outcome, I have to admit, didn't surprise me that much. I've looked at all the sites and the down-loadable images from the inter web and I had a feeling the film would end like this. The main part of the theater I was in however didn't, so you can see the polttwist as a success.<br/><br/>Watchmen is not a bluckbuster. Of course there are big expolsions, amazing fighting-scenes and simply spectaculair special effects, but the film serves an other goal. It doesen't want to push you into your'e chair thrilling of excitement, and therefore it doesen't. But is does let you think about everything else. What exactly the point was the film tries to make I still don't know, but it still keeps me busy. And that's something I never expected."
"Mxzplk","Null","15","39","1 March 2009"," Full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing. So is Watchmen: a historic landmark in narcissist film-making
","Watchmen opening sequence is something truly memorable: a series of dioramas animated by actors in flesh and bone which, to the sound of The Times They Are A-Changin', by Bob Dylan, narrates the ascension and decline of a group of individuals that, in the 40's, for fun and also due to conviction, invented personas and costumes to team up to fight crime - and then, in the passing of years and transformations that occurred in the United States, began to be identified as a fascist pseudo police, and finally, ended becoming illegal by the government of Richard Nixon (which, in this parallel universe, never resigned and has been elected to presidency for the fifth time). The images are both at the same time beautiful and melancholic, which, underlined by Dylan's song, evoke one of the most vertiginous aspects of American life: the euphoria of the peak and the humiliation of the fall into disgrace. These, however, are the few emotions that Watchmen is capable of provoking in its almost 3 hours lenght. And, every time some sense begins to emerge, the coincidence repeats itself: some iconic and meaning loaded music is monitoring the scene. Which, in other words, means to say that Watchmen doesn't have much inside of it. Directed by Zack Snyder, of 300, he is the cinematographic equivalent of a narcissist: a creature so involved with itself and so full of its own beauty that it doesn't occur to it that it isn't enough only to exist, but that it is also necessary to try to reach the people that are convened to appreciate it.<br/><br/>Released in the 80's by Dave Gibons and Alan Moore (which, as in V for Vendetta, demanded by a matter of principle for his name to not appear at the movie credits), the Watchmen graphic novel is considered the gold standard of the genre, the comics that all other comics aspire to be. As always in Moore's work, it carries a political subtext that is at the same time naive and fierce in its disposal to report the infinite variants of the intoxication that power provides. But Watchmen has something more: a delicate and even compassionate understanding of the uneasiness of the soul that having or losing this power leads to. His characters illustrate it in several ways - from the sexual impotence of the Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), and the obsession for vengeance of Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) to the increasing distance of the superpowerfull Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) puts between himself and humanity and to the venality of the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), whose assassination starts the plot.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder follows really close both the situations described by Moore and the sadness of the protagonists. What he can't do is express it: in his own effort in translating the images that could only happen in cinema and in no other visual means. Snyder surrounds the emotion center of the story with so much noise and fury that he overshadows it completely. So, strong actors like Patrick Wilson and Billy Crudup become small and out of scale in this gigantic tableau; and, when violence breaks out, it doesn't transmit the ferocity - it looks like it is only there for free and it is almost pornographic, as some sort of knock on the head that serves to draw the audience out of the induced apathy by the excess of plot and lack of what to communicate with it. Therefore, Watchmen seems like destined to become a landmark: a landmark in both its gorgeous visual concept and language, and as of the sterility in which a certain strand of American cinema is going through. As Dr. Manhattan, this is a movie immensely powerful and impressive - and can barely remember what is like to be a human being."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","7","15","13 June 2010"," Superheros who actually do more damage than good
","Last year I remember when Watchmen was released and everyone was so beyond excited for it. I had asked one of my co-workers why it was such a big deal and he looked at me all shocked that I had never heard of Watchmen and said it was one of the biggest graphic novels of all time. I did want to see the film, but never got around to it, mainly because I have to admit that I was put off when all I heard when I asked how the film was, was ""blue penis!"". How in the heck am I supposed to take that? But I let my guard down and saw it on HBO, I still have not read the novel, so I was a bit put off. Thankfully I recorded it and re-watched it because I wasn't sure what to take from it. But I'm glad I did give it another chance because I liked it a lot better the second time around. If you haven't read the book, it does put you off a bit because it's a very strange world and it's not like watching ""Spider-Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"" where you know these figures as well or what they stand for. I thought it was going to be a typical comic book movie where the hero's fight for justice for some kind of revenge you know the story. But Watchmen was something different and a lot more outside the box, which I really enjoyed. The whole film is absolutely beautiful and nicely shot. While the film is flawed, it's still an achievement in cinema that I learned from my friend that everyone thought would not and could not be made.<br/><br/>The story takes place in an alternate time line in which masked, costumed heroes fight crime in America called the Watchmen. The Watchmen have been outlawed by Congress after an outpouring of anti-vigilante sentiment in the country, and tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union have escalated the Cold War with threats of nuclear attack. By 1985, only three Watchmen remain active: the Comedian and Doctor Manhattan, and the masked vigilante Rorschach, who refuses to retire and remains active illegally. Investigating the murder of government agent Edward Blake, Rorschach discovers that Blake was the Comedian, and concludes that someone may be trying to eliminate the Watchmen. He attempts to warn his retired comrades. his former partner Nite Owl, the emotionally detached Mr. Manhattan, and Dr. Manhattan's lover the Silk Spectre. Nite Owl is skeptical, but nonetheless relates the hypothesis to billionaire Ozymandias, who dismisses it. Later, Rorschach's conspiracy theory appears to be justified when Veidt, narrowly avoids an assassination attempt, and Rorschach finds himself framed for murder. Meanwhile Spectre, after breaking up with Manhattan, goes to stay with Nite Owl, and the two former superheroes come out of retirement as they grow closer. After they break Rorschach out of prison, Silk Spectre is confronted by Dr. Manhattan. He takes her to Mars and, after she asks him to save the world, explains he is no longer interested in humanity. As the superhero's realize the flaws they have, decide to join forces and save the world in their own way.<br/><br/>Like I said, I can't judge the movie with the book, I just had to take the movie for what it was. The only thing that I wasn't happy with was who they cast for Silk Spectre, Malin Åkerman is an alright actress, but from the story that I watched, she didn't seem appropriate for what I would expect. But the stand out performances for me were by Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Patrick Wilson does a great undertone to Nite Owl, his alter ego as Dan was perfect and someone who I would never suspect of being a superhero. Jackie however was the ultimate break-through performance, I found his back story to be the most intriguing and I wanted his story to continue further. Same with Mr. Manhattan, his back story was incredible and could have been a film in itself. At almost 3 hours long, I did not find myself bored at all with Watchmen, it stands out cinematically and I found it a lot better than ""blue penis"" reviews. <br/><br/>8/10"

"Red_Identity","Null","7","15","27 July 2009"," A stunning and powerful adaptation of the best graphic novel ever made!
","Let me start off by saying that I saw the Director's Cut of Watchmen, so this review is based solely on the DC. Watchmen is a film that might enrage a lot of people who were expecting to see an action film. The novel is a very provocative and very complex look at the superhero life. A lot of the superheroes are very flawed, and unlikeable as well. The film explores the basin of the world they live in, and the problems facing them and everyone else at that time. The novel is filmed almost entirely scene-by-scene into the film, and I am glad it was so faithful. I thought the film was brilliantly written and executed, almost to perfection. Yes, it is true that a lot of things said in a comic book can sound and look totally ridiculous on film, but I thought Watchmen did not have those problems. Of course, the context of the film is not as subtle as the novel, no film ever could, but it reaches pretty damn close, and for that, I am grateful. Many scenes work very well,and those that do not work in the same way as the novel work in their own right. A large part of why the film is as brilliant as it is is because of Zack Snyder. While I enjoyed Snyder's 300, it was pretty much always style over substance, with no real character development or plot. However, he was perfect for Watchmen. He gave it his 'flair', and you can see the similarities to 300, the slow-motion action, the shots, but I thought it all worked very well. While the graphic novel is very dense and not mainstream at all, it does hit upon some moments of action and thrills, and Snyder directed those moments in his own way. I thought it all worked, especially the new ending.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are simply great. I have heard many complaints about how the acting is not what people envisioned for Watchmen, but I have to say, from all the actors that could have taken these great characters, I am glad these did. Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are the ones getting the raves they deserve. All three was spot-on from the novel, and I do think they all deserve serious awards recognition, especially Haley who has given the single best performance of 2009 so far. His mannerisms and expressions are exactly what I imagined for Rorschach. The same for Morgan and Crudup, both incredibly great. I also want to recognize three other great performances- Matthew Goode, Patrick Wilson, and Carla Gugino. Personally, I loved Ozymandias in the novel, and I was afraid how Goode would portray him. I thought he was brilliant. I actually think he gave justice to the character in a whole different way that i envisioned him. I think he was just as great as Haley, Crudup, and Morgan. Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II, which was actually my least favorite superhero of the novel. I thought Wilson gave it his all best, and made him even better in the film. I thought he played him with doubt, fear, and confusion, and was great at it. Also making him the most likable of the bunch, since his character, also Silk Spectre II are the most likable and least flawed of them. Carla Gugino was brilliant in her character. Like with Goode, she portrayed the first Silk Spectre in a different way than I would have thought, and I loved it. Now to Malin Akerman, who is being picked as the weakest in the cast. She was not as great as the other five, but seeing her character, no actress would ever be. But I thought she was very good. She did have some flaws, although I think it was some flaws in her dialogue at times. But overall, I thought she pulled it off. I was expecting something much worse than I got, because she really was not bad at all. The rest of the supporting cast are all great, but the stand-outs are all pretty much said already.<br/><br/>Now to the technical aspects. Watchmen has amazing visual and sound effects. I thought the scenes in Mars with Jon and Laurie was very true to the novel, and I loved it. Dr. Mahnattan's body glow, and his whole appearance was pretty much perfect. I loved the music in this film completely. While I did think the score towards the end was a bit too high and mainstream, I get why Snyder is doing it. But I do not really hold it against him, since the studio at least let him do this film. The opening credits, showing us a lot of the superhero world and from 1930-1985, with Bob Dylan's 'The Times They Are A 'Changin' was absolutely my favorite opening credits in years! The music put throughout the film was also great. And from all of the controversy, I seriously thought that the 'Blue Penis' was barely shown. I seriously did not notice it, and I cannot believe all the fuss it created. It was nothing! I thought the ending credits' song, from My Chemical Romance, was unfit in the story. <br/><br/>Overall, here it is! Watchmen the film, and I am so pleased with the way it turned out. For those who said it was unfilmable, well, they were wrong. I also think some of the criticism pointed towards the film is unjust, and cannot believe some critics did not like it. But again, I saw the Director's Cut, so I cannot really know how the theatrical version turned out. Bravo to Zack Snyder for giving us fans, and the rest of the world, the film about the Watchmen!"
"birch_2000","8","7","15","26 March 2009"," Tell me Doctor...what do you see?
","Like Rorschach's mask, ""Watchmen"" is a movie that is open for interpretation. Never have I witnessed such polarizing opinions for a film in my life, and though some are just plain off topic, most whether good or bad can be understood and respected.<br/><br/>I have been an advocate of this work for many years as the greatest piece of literature ever made, and to see it come to life in film was something I never thought was going to possible or feasible. I was proved wrong on both counts.<br/><br/>I viewed the movie from a fan-boy and a movie-goer perspective, and have to say I was blown away on both counts. As a fan-boy, Synder worked so hard to keep the crux of the story true to form, and maintained the ""Big Joke"" aura throughout the entire film. Though the ending was changed, he still managed to get the same meaning and point across, which whether you hated or liked the movie, you have to tip your hat too. The characters were all well cast, especially Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach who I thought were epic. No one I am convinced could have produced a better adaptation of the graphic novel.<br/><br/>As a movie-goer, this film challenged me to look beyond the traditional superhero genre and focus on a story where real people with real decisions and real problems try to live dual lives. It was a character study not just for those created in the movie, but for myself as well. You as an audience member are forced and challenged to make an active choice on how you feel about the end result, and how each character responds to it. This movie is about so much more than action, sex, violence, and visuals. It is an attempt to deconstruct and depict a different world, one that if it were true, may not be so different from our own.<br/><br/>I urge you to see this film. Not because I love it, or because I want it to do well. Because I think it is important that the mainstream aspects of our entertainment get an alternative view, and ""Watchmen"" does precisely that. This is a story that needs to be told, and I am convinced will continue to be for many years to come."
"AshCaton","10","7","15","23 March 2009"," The Best Comic Book Film I Have Ever Seen
","Watchmen surpasses entertainment. It is a punchy, gutsy piece that's not afraid of being horrible,or of being gaudily superhero-y at times. It is a plethora of stories all perfectly entwined together with slick confidence. It's well acted, beautifully shot and actually feels like it's from a comic book - something Marvel should be taking note of. No blustering around trying to make twenty year old comics more hip - Watchmen manages to be just as powerful as when the comic was released whilst still very much of a 1980's setting. This could not be more perfectly realised than by President Nixon, here with a comic rubber nose that wouldn't be seen dead in Frost/Nixon, but here fits in with lycra suits and night goggles perfectly. The superheroes themselves are all the favourite hero clichés; one with an obsession with retribution, the timid one with all the cool toys, the one who's lost control, the one who's turned bad, and the giant naked blue guys. But it outgrows any sense of cliché with its merciless satire on what these people have become and each of their fates are superbly fitting. Not a film for the faint-hearted but nevertheless, you can have all the X-Men, Spider-Man and even Batmans in the world if I can have four minutes of Watchmen. A triumph of modern cinema."
"the_rattlesnake25","8","7","15","16 March 2009"," Today, the Watchmen went from pages to the screen...
","Decades in movie purgatory. Years in production. Months of anticipation. Zack Snyder's film adaption of the graphic novel 'Watchmen', once deemed 'unfilmable' by Terry Gilliam, has finally hit theatres across the globe, and its hit them like a sucker-punch to Alan Moore's groin. With the most important question at the forefront of proceedings being, not who would be watching the Watchmen, but who would enjoy the Watchmen. Would the source material be sacrificed for a larger potential general audience, or would they be alienated due to the faithfulness of the adaption? I myself would say the latter, to an extent...<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's biggest achievement of the 'Watchmen' project has been his ability to replicate Alan Moore's source material as close-as-humanly possible. He has shown that while the project was clearly not 'unfilmable', it was, and always will be impossible to replicate a motion-picture clone of the graphic novel to an idealised reader's perception of perfection. However this did not stop Snyder from creating a film as faithful to the novel as we are most likely ever to see. It also did not stop him from alienating the potential move-going public outside of the Watchmen universe.<br/><br/>The film conveys a linear narrative which in-turn and in due course examines the backgrounds and motivations behind the 'main' characters allowing those with no knowledge of the alternative period in which the novel is set to become acquainted, to an extent (which is down to how much the audience is willing to hand the film and receive back), with the new world in-front of them. That is not to say the film is perfectly paced and layered, at times the action is split between two contrasting events which can send the viewer from solemn conversation to vicious, blood and guts violence in a matter of seconds creating a complex structure which may have certain viewers scratching their heads slightly. However, this is one of those inevitable problems that come with trying to reproduce the source material as naturally as possible.<br/><br/>Even the most stubborn admirer of cinema and the world around the medium must recognise the beautifully stylised scenery of the near-apocalyptic society in which the film is set. Pop-culture references abound, the streets lined with disgust, animosity and the raving magnitude of the conflicting personalities of the Watchmen members. While the sets, props and costumes draw you into a world of awe and astonishment, the brutality of the choreographed violence on-screen almost throws the audience off-balance and takes the viewer even closer into a world they may or may not have been familiar with. With the use of slow-motion in the various critical action sequences, Snyder allows the audience to take in every detail of every punch, of every strike and of every grimace of pain. Even those with the iron-clad stomachs may feel the need to turn and shudder as a meat clever is dropped into the suspecting skull of a local criminal. This is the Watchmen after-all, and they don't do things by half.<br/><br/>This is an alternative, dystopian future and thus deserves characters with such ominous flaws and attributes that would accompany such a rich, illustrated world. The United States of America and the Soviet Union are at the heights of Cold War tension, with doomsday on an ever gloomy horizon, despite the emergence of the one, true superhero among the ranks of the Watchmen members. Doctor Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a blue, shimmering being of infinite power, who can distort the rules of nature i.e. large-scale teleportation and who also single-handedly, won the United States the war in Vietnam (which allowed Nixon a third term in office). Behind the glistening body of Dr Manhattan, you have Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), a billionaire entrepreneur and self-proclaimed 'smartest man in the world', who is one of the few Watchmen members to release their identity after the Keene Act and build an empire upon this image. The sexy 'Silk Spectre II' (also known as Laurie Jupiter) is portrayed by Malin Ackerman, the latex-costumed female of the group who took over from her mother who was in the first generation 'Minutemen' (Sally Jupiter played by Carla Gugino) and despite her relatively large role in the sub-plot with 'Nite Owl II/Dan Dreiberg' (Patrick Wilson), her performance at many times falls flat emotionally and she is weakest character in film full of strong, male performances. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is 'The Comedian', a twisted individual murdered at the beginning of the film, a man with a mutated conscience and morals who strives on the ability to get a job done at any cost. While Patrick Wilson as the second 'Nite Owl' and Jackie Earle Haley as 'Rorschach' give the most vivid performances as two complex characters, one a man fighting to find his identity beyond his persona as a crime-fighting vigilante dressed as an Owl and another without an identity, a hollow-shell of a human being who has lost faith in humanity and the emotions and logical conventions which make us human beings. 'Rorschach' is the closest towards a protagonist we are shown in the film and the graphic novel, because in this mutilated society, there are no heroes left.<br/><br/>After watching the 'Watchmen' film I was left with a profound sense of enjoyment and satisfaction. Of course this wasn't perfection in the art film-making, the film had its visible flaws which is inevitable for any film of such a large-scale magnitude, however these were unnoticeable when I was drawn into the story, the lives of the characters on-screen. I had only previously read about the characters and their motivations in the dystopian world in which the Watchmen film is set, but to see them alive in such a visual spectacle, roaming, fighting, embracing, engaging, was nothing short of a joy to watch."

","Papai Movie Review - WATCHMEN I did something rare this week -- actually saw a movie in the theater in its opening week. It took WATCHMEN to pull that off. This short review is based solely on the movie and what I know about it; I've not read any of Alan Moore's graphic novels, but I have seen a couple others of his works as movies, especially V FOR VENDETTA (like it a lot!) and FROM HELL (excellent! about Jack the Ripper).<br/><br/>WATCHMEN is a rather existential film, about the human condition and what being ""alive"" and ""safe from harm"" are about. It takes place in an alternate universe, late 1985, and Nixon is still president. Thanks to Doctor Manhattan (Billy Crudup) we won in Vietnam and the world has changed. However, the Soviet Union and its nuclear arsenal are still the arch enemy of the USA.<br/><br/>Into this world a Watchman (formerly the ""Minutemen"" during the 1940s) is murdered, brutally. The film is ULTRA violent and not suitable at all for kids younger than 16. Watchmen are all humans without extraordinary powers (unless you count 'uber Bruce Lee karate moves' superhuman -- even by a woman, Silk Spectre II, played by the beautiful Malin Akerman of Sweden, has such highest level, 0.0001% top class karate skills). Watchmen are illegal in 1985 by a law passed by US Congress in the '70s. Their style of vigilantism is no longer welcomed. Doc Manhattan is still legal, works for the Dept. of Defense, and is the ultimate weapon of the USA. He has true superpowers transcending anything imaginable. In fact, he is god. He is superman. He lives in a quantum state and can be in multiple places at the same time. Like the OUTER LIMITS, he was created by accident during some science gone wrong in the 1950s. Now he is god and is an American! The movie's hero is Rorschach (Jackie Earl Haley of BREAKING AWAY ""Cutters"" fame). He still wonders the dark, shadowy back alleys kicking criminal's ass and is the film's narrator ala film noir style. He's a hell of a fighter and wants to solve the mystery of who killed the Comedian. The film's pacing, plot, intelligence, and direction is stunningly brilliant. It's an adult film that should appeal to all science fiction buffs and deep thinkers.<br/><br/>If this stuff appeals to you, and the long length (2:40) of this movie, then go see it! I rate it a full 4-stars and it's now in my top 10 list of All Time -- it's that good.<br/><br/>-Ken Papai, 3/13/2009"
"Stampsfightclub","9","7","15","13 March 2009"," Slick and realistic, Watchmen is hero of all superheroes
","In a time of political warfare between Russia and The United States, an ex-superhero is murdered which encourages vigilante Rorschach (Haley) to investigate and get back into his superhero ways.<br/><br/>July 2008 and the eagerly anticipated The Dark Knight is released, predictably smashing box office records. Taking the comic book genius and turning it into an enthralling fantasy thriller with sweeping direction and an impressive Oscar winning performance by Heath Ledger. So had we seen the greatest comic book adaptation? Yes, until now.<br/><br/>Superhero films are usually made for family viewing to gain high profits and to be seen by viewers of any age and so we see realism in a constricted context. Sex scenes, violence, blood and drug uses are all limited but Watchmen is brilliant. It is one of very few films in the genre to throw caution to the wind and do what is right in the plot's context. The direction by Snyder does not shy away from anything and has all the right elements to reflect the time of the plot and therefore you feel rewarded for the film's honesty to portray it as it is.<br/><br/>Watchmen, adapted from Alan Moore's graphic novels, hits all the right buttons. Great characters, stunning visuals and a cool collection of action sequences and sophisticated direction. But this is so much more than a superhero flick. It has real life issues and agendas and though the Spider-Man franchise justifies this, Watchmen feels more accurate and appreciative without diving too much into a soap styled genre. For starters we open into a politically stubborn government debating over the threat of war and how it will affect the world. This 2009 picture also looks at the use of superheroes in the community and how the police forces are corrupt and enforcing a stubborn grip on the nation.<br/><br/>Whereas this looks at the nation with reliance on superheroes or vigilantes it does not effectively reflect how the police are affecting the system but looks more into the political agenda of the President's motives and impulses.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's choices are effectively established to justify that sense of action and crime and when needing to, that intense feeling of a thriller, none more so than a great opening scene with the Comedian.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi and Christopher Nolan have made names for themselves as established directors in the superhero category with Spider-Man and Batman and Snyder uses a fast paced style in comparison but adds a spicy sense of energy through some effective slow down motions that rival the Matrix and in conclusion, makes Snyder a hero for creating arguably the most riveting and surprising superhero film to date."

","As someone who has NEVER read the comic (or ""graphic novel""... back off nerds) and who is an avid film fan, I was only judging it as a movie and I was not impressed. <br/><br/>Let me start with the good points as that won't take as long. I liked how they showed the humanity of the heroes and all their imperfections. It was refreshing and different. Also, some of the characters were very interesting, the story itself was pretty cool and there were a lot of great moments. <br/><br/>HOWEVER... for all the great moments, there were even more moments that went absolutely nowhere. Entire scenes that didn't move the story along and should have been left on the cutting room floor. It was like they just kept going... ""HEY GUYS, LOOK WHAT WE INCLUDED!"" and ""REMEMBER THIS FROM THE COMICS!?!?"" and ""I BET YOU THOUGHT WE'D FORGOT ABOUT THIS!!!"" and it was all very pointless and very distracting from the story. Yet other things went completely unexplained and left me asking, ""what's with the horny blue tiger?""<br/><br/>Maybe if I had read the comics first I may have been more happy with it. After all this was a movie for the ""Fanboys"", but as a film fan, I would have much rather a GREAT movie that the Fanboys would have hated than a lousy movie that the fan-boys loved... and I'm still hearing people complain that they omitted a whole sub-plot about some pirate comic. Like what would have made this movie better is if it was LONGER!?!? Don't worry though... they apparently shot the footage and are saving it for the extended 4 hour ultra-boring edition DVD.<br/><br/>Now I'd Love to see an hour and a half version... That would be GREAT! That what was so frustrating. There was a GREAT movie in there, but it was buried under so much pointless crap. They should have just made the movie about Rorschach... He was by far the strongest and most interesting character and all the really great scenes were all about him. Instead we find ourselves on Mars with Doctor Boring, watching him do pointless things that take us away from where the story is actually happening. Then there are the sex scenes. Entirely pointless and tasteless. I'm not saying, don't let the characters f**k... I'm saying this isn't a porno, I don't need to see every nipple twist, or man ass pumping away... I know what sex looks like, you don't need to show me (though I'm sure this is closer than some of the fan-boys may ever get to sex) You can elude to it. You don't need to show it. After this movie we stayed for a showing of Batman (1989) now that was a GREAT comic book movie! They didn't show the sex... they showed Bruce and Vicki going' upstairs, then showed Bruce wake up at night with Vicki in his bed, tasteful, short, sweet, we know what they did and it kept the story moving. The Watchmen (just like the dark knight) needed some serious editing. It clocked in at a whopping 163 min and there was NO REASON FOR IT! I suggested to a fan (and they disagreed)... make it a trilogy. Make three, hour and a half long movies and you can include EVERYTHING... and it wouldn't have suffered for it. Well, maybe not. I still think that it just wouldn't have translated well onto the screen. Not like Sin City (Never read those books either) witch was apparently shot for shot, panel for panel for the most part. Not that The Watchmen is a BAD book, but some stuff just doesn't translate well. <br/><br/>Also, the soundtrack was terrible. Not bad songs, bad use of songs. The movie takes place in the mid 80's, but most of the music was from the 60's. I'm sure it was a clumsy attempt to draw parallels between the civil unrest then and ""now"", but it was really just distracting. If they wanted us to stay in the movie they should have just used tunes from the 80's.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've now wasted more time on this movie so I'm gonna stop my rant now. Let me just close by saying I hope they release an EDITED version of the DVD... it's the only way I'd watch it again. Fletch"

"georgebush","3","7","15","9 March 2009"," mean, awful soap opera
","This film is a mean film pretending to be a comic book movie. This long movie seems like it will never end. All of the characters become unlikable except for possibly Rorschack. This film is a violent soap opera. Obviously this fits into the hate America films completely. I will just mention a few of the bad points. The North Vietnamese are portrayed as victims of America and those scenes come straight out of the North Vietnamese propaganda films that the North Vietnamese released during the war. Of course, in real life, soon after the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam, millions of people were slaughtered by the North Vietnamese. This movie may pretend to be conservative at moments but that will only affect those who do not know why they are conservative. The movie is anti everything to the core. <br/><br/>This film has scene after scene of having to look at one of the main characters naked. The other characters are mostly jerks. The film is unrelentingly depressing with not one moment of real action or adventure. The only action is just brutal gore. One unfortunate growing trend in some films is to show good guys with flaws. To basically say that good guys do not exist is to say that nothing really means anything. It is the opposite of what Americans have believed for centuries. It is a mental head game. In many ways it just celebrates darkness and makes everyone weaker. This film takes this to the utter extreme. These good guys are killers, rapists, impotent. or weird. It makes you want to run from the head games of this film. There is nothing real here. It is just one big dark head game. Stop the head games and get real.<br/><br/>The one good line comes from when one of the characters put into prison with convicts he was responsible for having arrested says ""I am not trapped in here with them, they are trapped in here with me."" One line in almost three hours of a boring violent, misleading, depressing and pointless film. This film is the opposite of The Dark Knight. That film had moments of darkness but was a good film. Watchman is dark with nothing else to it. Scene after scene of undressed people, love scenes, soap opera mentality, boredom, and moronic moments make this in my top twenty worst movies list."
"griffin84","10","7","15","8 March 2009"," Who Watches the Watchmen? .... We do!
","I'll go ahead and admit it: I have never read the original 'Watchmen' graphic novel (always wanted to, never really got the chance), and when my husband and I saw the first couple teaser trailers, we agreed on one thing: ""OK, so this is a superhero movie... but what the heck is it about?!?"" Still, we knew just how big the graphic novel was, so after reading up a little on the backstory, we went to see it on the opening weekend.<br/><br/>When I went in, I wasn't sure what to expect: the reviews had been pretty split, and a few of my friends had even gone on to say that this was the worst 3 hours of their lives. Still, I was determined to see it, and for once, I was glad I didn't listen to my friends... 'Watchmen' is a dazzling tour-de-force that grabs the viewer's attention and refuses to let go.<br/><br/>There is little that I can find to hate about 'Watchmen': the casting was great (the actors truly blend into their characters, none more-so than Jackie Earle Haley, who completely disappears into the role of Rorschach), the visual effects are great, and no matter how many subplots are going on (and trust me, there are a few), you still can't look away.<br/><br/>The most important aspect, however, is that this is NOT a movie for fanboys. Zach Snyder was determined to stay as close to his source material as possible, so much that many people were worried that they only ones who would like this movie would be those die-hard fans who actually dress up as Nite Owl & Dr. Manhattan for the midnight showings (you know who you are). However, the movie is great, and does not just play out to those who already read the novel. As I stated before, I have yet to read it, and I was able to follow what was going on clearly.<br/><br/>Alan Moore, the genius who gave us the original graphic novel, has apparently sworn to never watch this movie; that's his prerogative. He evidently doesn't trust Hollywood to do justice to his work, and I'm sorry he has such little faith, because Snyder does not disappoint. I highly recommend 'Watchmen' to anyone, young and old alike, this is one of those rare movies that you can easily see over and over again."
"darkmax","8","7","15","5 March 2009"," Sub-adult adaptation of the comic
","I went in with no expectation or disgrunt. I was pleasantly surprised. Not extremely, just pleasantly.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies no one has any idea how it will be until it is released. There is enough violence, nudity and gore in there to satisfy the bloodthirsty and perverted movie-goers, but also enough (super)human drama not to make this into another poorly made movie adaptation.<br/><br/>The plot is, as with most comics, quite shallow. But not as obvious as Iron Man, Hulk or even Batman Begins (,etc..). What's unusual is the attempt at emphasizing the relationships between the characters. However, the 160+ minutes of the movie simply isn't enough to make the audience feel enough attachment to the characters.<br/><br/>CGI, in my honest opinion, is just like every other movie these days. It used to be a novelty, now it is just plain over-used. A note must be taken in that the movie was made to simulated a world where handphones and portable computers have not come of age, a world where younger audiences may not be able to relate to.<br/><br/>The nudity and sex scenes were fine. It is unusual for scenes like this to appear in this genre. But isn't it about time? This movie is worth at least 80% of your ticket price."
"vbertola","1","13","33","19 March 2009"," Disgusting - a good argument for censorship
","I went to see this movie with friends, completely unprepared. I had never heard of the comic before - I understand that for its fans things may be different, however for me this was, hands down, the worst movie of my life. It's not just bad, it's disgusting and evil.<br/><br/>Cinematographically speaking, the movie is terrible; adding elements such as actors, writers and a decent director could have helped. The viewer is forced to sit through 2 hours 45 minutes of bad acting, unbelievable dialogues, puzzling plot and violent beatings all choreographed the same way (hit right, hit left, hit up, hit down, repeat ad libitum). The final plot twists are ridiculous and they are mixed with silly, stupid, pretentious musings on the destiny of humanity. In the meantime, the director resorts to all the tricks of whoever has to fill a meaningless movie, including special effects, random flashbacks (some repeated three or four times) and videoclips.<br/><br/>So you get in the middle of three extremely boring hours that you wish you had spent doing something else, but that's not even the worst part of it.<br/><br/>The worst part of it is that this movie is filled with completely gratuitous violence: not just lakes of blood everywhere, but a 6-year-old girl torn to pieces and given as food to dogs, with an insisting picture of her torn leg in the jaw of the dogs; with a guy whose hands are cut with a jigsaw and left there; with countless men splattered, spread on the ceiling, exploded from inside, killed or tortured by the ""superheros"", often just for fun; of a pregnant woman killed with a gun by her man as a solution to get rid of her; and with the beating of a woman, up to filling her face with blood, followed by a meticulously shown rape; and tens and tens of similar scenes.<br/><br/>All of this, really without any plausible reason - it's not necessary to show all this blood for the story, and for what regards character development and messages from this movie, well there's none of them anyway. So the only plausible reason for all this violence is to allow the director to cover up his mediocrity by filling up the void with gory visual effects.<br/><br/>It was terrifying to me to see that no one else in the theatre (well there were just 10 people on 750 seats, and this it's the premiering week - what an outstanding success) seemed to be troubled by this kind of show, and there were even a couple of people laughing at the image of a guy killed by dropping his head into boiling oil, then letting him suffer in atrocious ways on the spot, of course shown up to the very detail. I thought, how nerd do you have to be to laugh at this, rather than be disgusted? In the end, Watchmen is the best supporting argument in favour of censorship that I've seen in twenty years, and a clear proof of the degradation of Western civilization; even I (and I am a pretty open minded person) went out praying for more control on what is shown on our screens, and being disappointed since I could not puke on the floor of the theatre (something I really felt like doing several times) then leaving my puke just there and possibly even spreading a bit of it on the silver screen as a sign of disapproval.<br/><br/>I think that the director Zack Snyder should be forced not just to watch this junk in an endless loop forever, but to give his own daughter as food for dogs after cutting away her hands with a jigsaw - then we'd see what he actually thinks of ultraviolence. I have been lucky enough to never see 300, and I swear I'll never be, nor I'll be watching any other movie by this immoral director or by any other person involved in the making of Watchmen. Be warned."
"wirving345","1","12","30","7 March 2009"," I should have walked out. I hate you Snyder!!
","I'm smack in the middle of the demographic audience for this movie. Never in my life have I wanted to bash a movie quite like this. Watchmen is so into itself, every shot so 'artistic', so self-conscious, so over-the-top, it almost brings down the ""I'm not your typical comic-book villain"" fourth wall. <br/><br/>PACING: Slow slow slow - I knew something was I miss when the sappy opening credits would never end. No plot. No direction. Just an extended music video. The audience was wondering when the movie would end. People got frustrated and left at the one hour mark. People were still leaving 10 minutes before the movie ended (thankfully). We often complain about how character development gets quashed by the plot these days. This is just the reverse and fares worse. Flashbacks by the thousands pop on the screen just when you think you can pack up your stuff and leave. By the time the ""climax"" shows up, you don't care about any of these characters. Just please blow up the Earth and end the movie for us all! <br/><br/>MESSAGE: Superheros are fallible - got it. Mankind must work things out for themselves - got it. The Comedian was far from perfect. Got it. To enforce this point way over the edge was the brutal rape scene and pregnant woman getting shot. Double check. Was it necessary to spend 2 hours and 45 minutes of my life to hammer this in? See pacing above.<br/><br/>CRITICS: I'm utterly convinced Warner Bros. has paid off the critics to review this movie positively. This is totally out of character for Roger Ebert to give four stars - his reviews I've always enjoyed reading but I question his ability to review movies after this piece of trash is considered a masterpiece (cough! cough!). The two Bens (err, Boneheads) of At The Movies loved it. Seriously, did Warner Bros. deliver a briefcase full of cash or was the money transfered from a Swiss bank account? I want to know! <br/><br/>USER REVIEWS: The early user reviews love it and most have read the graphic novel. Sorry, for I have not lived not having even heard of the novel. With so much money invested in this film, it's very possible for Warner Bros. to pay 1000 monkeys on 1000 typewriters to review this film favorably. Never in my life have I hated a movie so much. Bring on Godzilla or Pauly Shore's Jury Duty any day - and I thought those were awful. This movie falls into TMNTS (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Syndrome) where there is so much hype and love for the source material (in 1990 it was TMNT comics, cartoon series, action figures, video games), people feel the need to see this movie and love it no matter how ground chuck it is. <br/><br/>VISUAL EFFECTS: Impressive, yes. Popsicle Blue Man. Impressive, yes. Dark, depressing, uninspiring art direction. Impressive, no. And with no story to tie it together - just one big CGI portfolio. <br/><br/>HUMOUR: I chuckled a few times (especially Rorchash keeping score in the prison scene), but most of the jokes fell utterly flat. It was so painfully obvious the filmmakers were going for a quick, funny payoff at times, but the packed theatre was totally silent. Even the giggly teenagers sat silent.<br/><br/>VIOLENCE: I do not think weaving the shooting of JFK into the opening credits was very mature at all. This was a real event that happened and to make this tragedy into some graphic popcorn fun is insulting to society's morality (if we have any after this movie's release). Another scene that made the audience cringe was the brutal rape scene. Violence for the sake of violence is just tacked on. It never served a real purpose.<br/><br/>MUSIC: Just to enforce what decade we're in, we have 'period' music to sledgehammer it into the audience, like 99 Luftballoons. This is why I can't watch Cold Case. You set the time period by smart scripting, set decoration, costumes, film style. Period music is a cheap gimmick. I like music selections themselves (I have many on my iTunes), but their placement is wrong wrong wrong. <br/><br/>PREDICTABILITY: Like three prison dudes are really going to tear cloth-face apart, as if. We already know what will happen to them. The one-liners are predictable. Sex in the WatchMobile - saw it coming (no pun). The action scenes are predictable. Plays like a juvenile video game. Yawn.<br/><br/>HAPPY FACE: I hope Wal-mart sues Warner Bros for copyright infringement and they both annihilate each other which would be much more entertaining than this movie.<br/><br/>MPAA RATING: This is not directed at the filmmakers, but to all the stupid parents out there who don't seem to understand what 18A means. We had 4 and 6 year-olds sitting behind us. Were all the babysitters booked that night? Message to babysitters worldwide: Mississauga, Ontario needs you!!<br/><br/>What was the point of this movie? At least the super girls were nice to look at. For that, I give one star."
"Tatiana_Larina","2","8","18","16 March 2009"," I didn't know comics are supposed to be boring
","My husband and I watched ""Watchmen"" yesterday. The film can be described in the best way using his words: ""It all started really well, didn't it?"". It did start really well but it ended as a most boring adaptation of a graphic novel I have seen. Hours and hours of the screen time were spent in monotone dialogues and monologues of infinite importance that were read at you by actors who seemed to be obviously thinking about their dinner arrangements whilst reading.<br/><br/>The story itself is taken from an 80s graphic novel and taken literally, so this means that it is much more misogynistic, homophobic and disability-insensitive than the stories you are used to seeing on your screen. Consider the story of a woman who falls in love with her rapist, then deliberately conceives a child with him and who of course, forgives the rapist because he gave her a child. To add, the only person of colour that I have noticed in the film was a prisoner meeting his death through a deep burn by the use of deep frying pan in the hand of Rorschach.<br/><br/>Some of the special effects were really good, but I have to note that when you see a person being annihilated in a fire or a force to particles for the first time it might come as an interesting special effect. But when you see this very same effect done several times though the movie it might start to be getting old. More so, some of the special effects used in the film could be dated back to ""Matrix"".<br/><br/>The music score boasted by another over-use of L.Cohens ""Halliluah"" and an attempt to give credibility to the ending by the use Mozart's ""Requiem""."
"timbermisc","4","8","18","7 March 2009"," Boring for 50 - 60 year old
","The audience was filled with 24 year old men. What we have here are superheros in Halloween costumes. I never once believed anyone was a superhero. One was a fake ""batman"". The violence is graphic with hatchet in-the-head moves. Seen that, nothing new. There is sex action that adds no sensuality, no love. All the boys want to see the female superhero do sex. So what. There are spacecraft, so what, nothing new. They go to Mars, O.K. Lots of high tech graphics, so what, seen that, done that in other movies.<br/><br/>The actors mostly speak in breathy tones like they are reading lines for the second time. They are overly impressed with themselves in other words. The movie was nearly 3 hours long. I was bored and depressed after-wards. I never believed for a moment that anyone was a superhero. There are scenes with women beating up men like a Mike Tyson. I can't believe that! Then the women gets beat up very badly by a man. This is entertainment? What this is, is a fantasy that cannot be believed. If you are 50 - 60 years old you will enjoy the Jimmy Hendricks music. There is a midget actor that was good as a ""big man"" in the ""big house"". But that was it. The only thing new about this movie was the costumes."
"Quinoa1984","8","8","18","6 March 2009"," the super comic-book movie event exists - and it's a near perfect film
","It was called the classic ""unfilmable"" line, but Alan Moore and David Gibbons' Watchmen was film-able, and oddly enough after over 20 years of directors from Terry Gilliam to Darren Aronofsky to Paul Greengrass taking the possible helm the most commercial choice imaginable, Zack Snyder, made it film-able, and indeed a very, very good movie. How he accomplishes this is fairly straightforward: compress as much as possible of a 12-issue comic book series into a 2 1/2 hour running time, cut off certain pieces of fat (most notably the Black Freighter story which will be on DVD soon anyway as a bonus), and keep the structure and character development and stories 90% of the same. Also, make it about as accessible as possible to a mainstream audience without, possibly, insulting intelligences much.<br/><br/>Indeed this is an incredibly faithful adaptation all things considered - ""things"" being the fact that after reading the book, still (and I'll sound cliché like many others) the most compelling and daring and magnum-opus-of-all-time works from Moore and in the medium itself, largely of the details save for a reasonably crucial bit in the climax were left intact. Snyder knew to not get too much in the way of the story and characters would be a wise move, and it is in the sense that if a work is as rich and satirical and dark and violent and sometimes warped sometimes lucid and fairly tragic like the Watchmen it's best not to get in its way as it goes along.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, this is the best Watchmen film that we can expect from Zack Snyder, touted as a 'visionary' in the ads based on two good but definitely not great films Dawn of the Dead and 300. Because when he does not let the story well enough alone and puts his ""signature"" directorial touches on the proceedings, which is mostly slow motion, sometimes in annoying quick bursts that don't add anything of worth to the hyper-realism portrayed, it screams *much*! But, again, this thankfully doesn't happen with the kind of regularity and overbearing force of 300, and he can actually direct action and even dramatic tension really forcefully (this may come into fuller light on a repeat viewing or the director's cut). I'd even go as far as to say he's improved as a filmmaker, mounting such an impressive production with a cast of primarily character actors (matter of fact no real BIG stars), by taking the story where it needs to go both for those familiar and/or in love with the book, and for those looking for some solid entertainment.<br/><br/>I haven't described the plot yet. Here it is in a sentence, if I can try: it's 1985, Richard Nixon is still president (and Vietnam was a victory), America is at a close possible WW3 scenario with Russia, and superheroes are outlawed - and one of them, the Comedian, has been bumped off possibly, as masked psycho/bad-ass Rorscach thinks, by a killer of superheroes, leading to an investigation by him and other drama unfolding with the actual ""American Superman"" Dr. Manhattan and his sort of love interest Silk Spectre. If that's barely scratching the surface of it all then so be it, since this is even in the framework of the film (and I mean this as a compliment) dense with detail and motivation and dramas of the personal and big-time Earth scale.<br/><br/>Since the storytelling itself, with some of the exceptions I mentioned up before (another being a different twist done from the book for Veidt's plan), is solid and cunning and even featuring a more-than decent selection of songs, what about the cast? It's a mixed bag, frankly, but one that is at the least inoffensive and at best truly inspired, if perhaps as givens. Jackie Earl Haley, Billy Crudup and Jeffrey Dean Morgan go totally into their characters of Rorscah, Dr. Manhattan and the Comedian, making us feel for them just as we did in reading the text. Outside of that, for non-readers of the book, they're still fabulous performances, particularly for Crudup's very subtle touches in inflection (perfectly near-noticeable) and Haley as a tortured soul who sees fit to strike fear into anyone that might cut him down just a single peg (and, unlike Bale's Batman, I really believed Haley doing a super grunty voice for his character).<br/><br/>If nothing else, the back-stories with Manhattan (Crudup) and Rorscach (a hopeful Oscar nom for Haley), and to a slightly lesser extent Comedian (Morgan), are little masterpiece shorts in the midst of the epic running time, and are supported by these actors bringing their characters full of life and sorrow and so-black-it-stings humor. Goode and Wilson are not quite as good, and Akerman maybe just falls totally flat as perhaps the point but still nowhere near as convincing as the three big guns. Even an unreasonably funny scene like Night Owl and Spectre making love isn't totally convincing because of the acting.<br/><br/>In closing... Watchmen, worth seeing? Yes, very much so, especially if you're a fan already, but maybe so as well if going in blind. A masterpiece of a blockbuster? Not really. It's got some problems in a few scenes such as with the BAM BAM kind of style that if I were a crankier old critic I'd use as an example of the music video age destroying movies (it doesn't bother that much, but it still does subjectively). It was, happy to say, worth the tremendous hype. This being said, if you haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and read it first. Then see the movie. It's an excellent movie to talk about. 9.5/10"

You all who thought this movie was good must be smokin something. This was nothing but violence wrapped in sex with a bad superhero idea thrown in. The super heros were worse than the bad guys. Perhaps this was the idea and if so it was a bad one. The whole movie was stupid. The sex scenes were not even that good. I mean the night owl being impotent unless he kills or wears the suit.

Far gods sake folk. Wake up to this type of crap. This movie was awful in the extreme. A bad rape scene, people that supposedly have no powers throwing men around like they were rag dolls, (the women doing the throwing too). This is fantasy but very bad fantasy. My biggest gripe is that the whole thing didn't go anywhere. I am all for violence when needed but this was excess for no good reason but to do excess. I mean when the good Dr. takes a guy out he doesn't just kill him, no, no, no. He has to graphically mess the room up with him. I admit the effects were cool. But what was the sense to it? If he is so highly evolved then why not just ""erase"" the guys he kills. And why not use this vast power to heal a few folks huh? All he did was prance around and act superior. So what! sigh. I guess I will just have to realize that people don't no anything that is quality anymore. This movie is tripe and foolishness and money that could have been better spent to feed a few hungry people. Of course many movies these days are like that so I really don't know what I am complaining about. LOL"
"hot_ice72","9","12","31","5 March 2009"," A Serious, Stunning and Complex Film
","Watchmen is an adaptation of the renowned comic book series by Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons and John Higgins. Besides being a stunning film it is a fine advertisement to the depth, sophistication and maturity of quality comics.<br/><br/>The film justly decided upon a long length film of 2 hours and 43 minutes and an R rating; both facilitate the quality of the production. The themes of the movie include human nature, love, justice, power and, of course, good and evil. A galaxy of rich superhero content from the esteemed comics comprise the plot, as they confront an altered late 20th century history which is near human annihilation. Watchmen manages to portray depth in its characters via narrative which follows individuals whilst also following their complex relations. They are not 'do-gooders', but understandable humans with a spectrum of emotions and thoughts. <br/><br/>Complementary camera and editing effects also help the tempo of the film; this movie wasn't rushed. Action throughout the film is well proportioned, with the violent and fighting scenes being enjoyable. Some violence is severe yet it aids the story and doesn't feel superfluous. There are also a few intimate sex scenes that cohere with the experience of Watchmen with none feeling like cheap pandering. <br/><br/>Overall, I found Watchmen to be a very satisfying experience and feel the movie comes together as a success. I expect it's integrity will stand out and not waver in time to come.<br/><br/>p.s. I am not a comics connoisseur and this review is not a comparison between the comics and movie. Though after watching this film I intend to checkout a few comics.<br/><br/>Hot_Ice"

","All I can remember from this film is thinking that Dr. Manhattan is such a whiny, self-centered, and egotistical cry-baby. I'm sooo...sorry you have the burden of viewing the world differently than everyone else and seeing the future. It must be extremely difficult to have beautiful women pine for you as you struggle to not lose grip with reality and become apathetic due to your all knowing foresight. I have only seen the film once, and this is what I took away from it. Once was definitely more than enough. Even after several years following the film's original release, I can still remember leaving the theater dismayed and disconcerted as to what I had just witnessed. If I wanted to see a blue penis for the majority of a film, then I would have rented Smurf porn. Nuff Said."
"hanifmuhammad92","10","5","10","1 July 2012"," One of the most cerebral and moving superhero Epics ever made!
","I am a huge fan of superhero stories on film but I have never been into comics. I am very impressed by the quality of medium but they don't fascinate me as much. When I went to see The Dark Knight in theaters the Watchmen trailer took me completely off guard. I had never heard of the Graphic Novel prior to that moment but I was immediately interested. The trailer and the look and feel of the world had a truly epic feel to it that I have never seen in a Superhero adventure story. It appeared to be a completely different world that I could have imagined yet the griminess of it seemed to be genuine. The Strangeness of the world that was being shown on screen was more like a Dramatic alternate history/Science Fiction story than an action film. I expected the film to be a Darker and more realistic take on superheros as promised But nothing could have prepared me for The Mindblowing and Unfathomably Epic cinematic experience that this was.<br/><br/>This for me is an Unquestionable Masterpiece. Not Only does this meet every requirement necessary to make a good movie in the history of Mankind But it goes much further and deeper than that and presents the audience with Moral questions that most films are too afraid to ask. My experience watching this film is unique and an experience I have only had for a few films. In my opinion their is no Superhero film that can match this except The Dark Knight. It is because of This that I have committed to Reading The Graphic Novel in its entirety. After finishing it I could not be more pleased with How This turned out as an Adaptation. It did the book Justice in my opinion. One of my Favorite films and Books of all Time. It gripped me like no story has ever done.<br/><br/>The Casting is Spot on and absolutely Brilliant. Malin Akerman looks like she walked straight out of the novel. She fits the caricature of Laurie very well. Matthew Goode Performance was very intriguing and handled with perfect Finesse. Many fans complain that his performance was took dark and brooding and portrayed the character as completely evil. While I can certainly see where they are coming from I must respectfully disagree. The Character was certainly more sinister than he was in the Novel but I think Goode managed to convey a perfect counterbalance to that by also being friendly and charismatic at times. He was also very self reflexive and took responsibility for his actions at the end of the Film. He was actually less corrupt than some of the other characters until he decided to take matters into his own hands. Patrick Wilson was the perfect Nite Owl. I could feel the actors enthusiasm and passion for the Character in every single emotion that he conveyed. Jeffery Dean Morgan was born to play The Comedian. The life and Raw emotion that he brought to the role is Uncanny. Even Better than all of the actors above is Billy Crudup as Dr.Manhattan. The Man is a legend. Take all of these amazing Performances and multiply it times ten and you get Jackie Earl Haley's Performance as my favorite character Rorschach. I would put Jackie's performance on the same level as Health Ledger as the Joker. He was beyond mesmerizing and somewhere along the way he forgot who he was and became Rorschach. Every scene that he was in was a Joy or frightening to watch and every line he delivered will be quoted as an iconic classic. Nearly everything about the film was amazing from the cinematography to the production design and the obsessive attention to detail. The Soundtrack is unreal and The Score is truly moving. The Ending is the one aspect of this film that while being Faithful to the spirit of the Novel received many major changes all of which I thought were for the better. I am a huge fan of the Squid but Framing Dr.Manhatten in order to create world peace makes just as much sense. Also having Nite Owl see his old Partners death is much more fair to the character. It add to what was in my opinion the best scene in the movie and one of the best Tragic Death scenes that I have ever seen in my life. A lot of people were upset that nite Owl beats up Ozy after this scene and tells him that He ""Mutilated Humanity"". I didn't think he ruined the ambiguity of the movie at all. I think people think this because Nite Owl/Daniel is the heart of the story and many people see it through his eyes. He tells OzyMandias that he was wrong in blind fury and beats him up(which was awesome) but When continues life quietly with Silk Spectre he begins to consider that maybe the plan worked out for the Best. Overall this film is an Unforgettable experience unlike any other. If you are too immature to see a Naked blue man than skip it. But if you looking for a thought provoking and geo political film that questions whether or not Heroes can exist in a real an complicated world than look no further."

","I had never read the comics and must confess had not actually heard of them until the film's release. All i knew was that it had people in masks and apparently some strong violence. <br/><br/>What I expected was a generic superhero movie (batman style) with a predictable plot and lots of action. What i got was a very good surprise. Set in an alternate reality whereby America won the Vietnam war and Nixon as president long after the legal limit for presidency the film succeeds in building tension as the cold war becomes much closer to another World War whilst at the same time retired heroes (or masked vigilantes) appear to be being picked out for assassination.<br/><br/>I won't talk any more of the story but that combined with the brilliant acting all round and character development that attatches the viewer to the characters like no other film I've seen makes this one the top 5 films i have seen. <br/><br/>But! this is only my opinion and the film would not be enjoyed by firstly those looking for another Dark Knight as I would place it in a completely different genre, it requires more thought with only a small number of action sequences and it is more about the deep story and the background than a face off between two nemeses. And also by those who find it hard to accept films as they are and need films to be realistic because, lets face it, a blue godlike man is hardly the most believable character.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a great symbol of different perceptions on society and is everything I would enjoy seeing in a film although it wasn't until i saw it a second time i realized how great it is."
"jcbartistman","10","5","10","14 September 2009"," At least one good book-to-movie
","There have been many book to movie adaptations, from mistakes like Eragon to masterpieces like Lord of the Rings, but I think ""Watchmen"" has my vote for the film that is the most loyal to its novel counterpart. Snyder's attention to miniscule things in the book like clothing of background characters and translating the ragged word bubbles of Rorschach into a ragged voice for the film character made this film the best interpretation of the novel that you're ever going to see. Exact quotes were pulled from the book and lighting and camera angles were expertly reproduced into the high-quality film. When it comes to taking this graphic novel and putting it through Hollywood, Zack Snyder was the perfect man for the job."
"thinker1691","10","5","10","23 August 2009"," "" In the Dark world of Comics, there is a shattered window called Reality ""
","Growing up as a child, one of the first avenues to the world of reading came when I discovered my first comic book. Little did I know, within this fantastic world, there was a dividend which awaken my vivid imagination and allowed me to see the liquid, magical world of fantasy. Yet among those early comics, there were also a plethora of other fans who wished someone could make the comics come alive in a very real, adult sense. Such a wondrous world emerged when movies like ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeves and ""Batman"" with Michael Keaton were created. Although spectacular and entertaining, there was an ingredient missing. That torn sliver of fantasy arrived with this movie called "" Watchmen."" When you view this remarkable film, be prepared for a really exciting, gritty, physically gutsy, morbidly macabre 1950's atmosphere to envelop you as the director has reached the edge of the envelope and ripped it asunder. The story is set in the Alternative world of the 1980's. In this world, Nixion is re-elected for a third term and an aging group of magical super-heroes have been rendered obsolete. Mothballed into retirement, the world lumbers slowly into the unthinkable abyss of nuclear self-destruction and is terrifyingly real as reminded by the Doomday clock. The world needs help, but the Superheros are all powerless to help, until one night when one by one, for some unexplainable reason, they become the target of a mysterious and unknown character. One member Walter Kovacs (Jackie Haley) of the once incredible super heroes group called Rorschach, begins a dangerous investigation with the death of The Comedian (Jeffry Morgan). He is aided by Nite Owl (Pat Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) and the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) yet, despite their combined powers, they face certain death as both the world and their group face the end of the world. The film is bursting with dark explosive black drama and nearly all the ingredients are present to create a monumental Classic. This is recommended as just that, a dark movie for anyone who was raised on Classic comics. Superb viewing. ****"

Don't be put off by the costumes, they do look stupid but soon feel right. I waited for the directors cut to watch this, on blu ray, after being told its good.And i was rewarded with 3hrs of brilliant film making.The writing, directing and effects, all were great, faultless.The story was really good, and left me hungry for a sequel.I never heard of the watchmen before this film, now im searching for the source. The characters and the world depicted, are so well done, and so real.Never have super hero's been written this way.Each character is opened up and laid bare for the viewer, and you get so attached.Even the not so nice Comedian (brilliantly acted by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) pulls the old heart strings.I cannot comment on how it relates to the anime or graphic novel, but you get the feeling watchmen fans are more than happy.This is the kind of hero story I've always wished for, spiderman and the xmen are always way too politically correct for me.Where as watchmen is definitely not for kids.<br/><br/>My hats off to Snyder, and to Alan Moore, Dave gibbons and John Higgins.Im off to explore a DC comics store, and see what other brilliant stuff they been hiding."
"suburbannightmare","4","5","10","7 April 2009"," Hallelujah...?
","I watched the Watchmen. And I'm still in turmoil somewhat. In essence, I reckon it lost a bit of something in translation. Now there's been a lot of Snyder-bashing just recently over this movie, but let's face it, the man is fantastic at what he does - he makes things look awesome. Poppcorn-munchingly, fanta-freeze-slurpingly eye-poppingly awesome. Butthat seems to be it. Which sometimes isn't bad. We all like movies we can put on and enjoy without engaging brain too much. But the source material this movie owes itself to is not mindless gloss. It's a very complex, well-drawn, brilliantly written multi-layered triumph. It's a Harvard study text for crying out loud. I think that's what's lacking. Some of the characters are not great, some are fantastic. Rorshach? Dark, sinister, psychotic, and brilliantly played by Jack Earle Haley. The Comedian? He looks like he's been pulled straight from the comic book. Nicely done. Nite Owl? He's great, a timid, slightly repressed pseudo-loser, well-portrayed by Patrick Wilson who incidentally, has one of the most gorgeous mouths I've ever seen! Malin Akerman's Laurie, to be brutally honest, sucks. Bad. She's nothing much more than a quasi-feisty, foot-stomping piece of eye-candy. Which is pretty much what she is in the book, but she's also a real spitfire. OK, movie Laurie throws some wickedgood punches, but in a Zack Snyder film, EVERYONE can kick ass. Billy Crudup's Dr Manhattan's not bad - a little scary, but I suppose a naked blue dude wandering around babbling about quarks would have that effect on many people. Ozymandias is a bit of a weird casting choice. He reminds me too much of the character of Niles from 'Fraiser', a little effeminate and delicate. He doesn't do bad though, he's just a bit different from what I'd have expected. (lest we forget, Ozymandias had brains AND brawn.) The whole look of the movie is amazing. Snyder has an unmistakable cinematic style. It's glossy, - relatively faithful to the book, too, look out for the Gunga Diner balloon! - dark, and ultra slick, and coupled with Snyder's signature fast-mo/slow-mo action sequence filming (which a lot of people find highly annoying. I find it highly cool, even if it is purely visual-only), it does look breathtaking. This movie spawned a trailer that promises fabulous things, and from an aesthetic point of view, it doesn't fail. It triumphs, it's a beautiful movie to look at. Aside from that though, I don't think it delivers much else. Even with dialogue lifted directly from the comic (Rorshach's monologues. Brilliant!) and being as faithful as possible to the plot line (less some edits, and a slightly altered ending) it still lacks a certain somethingsomething that the comic book had a big fat stockpile of. Maybe Snyder is just a purely looks-only filmmaker, maybe I expected too much from a film of a comic book that I've loved for years. But there's still something niggling at me, and until I see this film again, I'll be bugged as hell about it."
"joker-4","8","5","10","2 April 2009"," Sex! Blood! Superheroes!
","WATCHMEN is the latest comic book to gain an adaptation by filmmaker Zack Snyder, whose film 300, based on the Frank Miller series of the same name, became a $210 million phenomenon in 2006. WATCHMEN is also the latest adaptation from the works of Alan Moore (V FOR VENDETTA, FROM HELL and, ahem, LEAGUE OF EXTRORDINARY GENTLEMEN all have big-screen counterparts). WATCHMEN, the comic, is deemed sacrosanct among the fanboy faithful and is considered to be one of those culture-crossing reads defined as a thinking-man's comic while also being a catalyst of change within its own genre giving comic books more mature themes.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN, the film, is essentially a murder mystery that takes place in an alternate 1985 where Nixon is still President, the U.S. won the war in Viet Nam and superheroes are illegal. The Comedian, a costumed hit-man, is murdered causing another costumed hero, Rorschach, an ink-face blotted, overcoat-wearing detective of sorts who provides the film's ongoing monologue, to believe there is a growing conspiracy against former heroes. This conspiracy begrudgingly reunites some of these watchmen as they launch their investigation. Murder, violence and blood, lots of blood, follows.<br/><br/>Snyder and screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse provide a faithful adaptation of the graphic novel providing exact panel-by-panel reproductions in some cases and maintaining a majority of the original dialogue. Coupled with spectacular F/X work, most noticeably on the electric-blue CG-character Dr. Manhattan, the film looks great. Where the film differs is the staggering amount of violence and gore added.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN, as story, is definitely R-rated material. Rape, impotency, sex and the aforementioned Dr. Manhattan, who is naked for most of his screen time (he no longer requires clothes for he neither modest nor requires their protection), certainly sets this thematically apart from IRON MAN and DARK KNIGHT. But as genre-breaking as the story might be, WATCHMEN is still a genre film and must abide by certain parameters that bind all genre pieces. These are all ignored allowing instead the glorification of violence and a level of gore must more suitable for Snyder's zombie film than his superhero one. Violence and superhero action can go hand-in-hand and where Snyder does use such to lengthen scenes noticeably shorter in their original form (like Comedian's murder) in other instances, like the disturbingly-powerful near-rape scene and a mugging attempt, the filmatic violence detracts from the hero's true path, used instead to shock the mainstream audience and perhaps wow the teenaged videogamer.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN can be described as a sophisticated, multi-layered mystery using superheroes as the backdrop and is not easily compared to such films as the X-MEN. Such a comparison is akin to relating RAGING BULL to ROCKY or BARTON FINK to ADAPTATION."
"diki24","6","5","10","1 April 2009"," why so much of melodrama??
","While the movie starts off very well and also the Alternative past, where Nixon is serving his 3rd term and other similar elements do build the atmosphere extremely well. However movie wanders along aimlessly along the stories of each members of Watchmen. After a while you start to wonder whats the story about? Most of the scenes look like being there just for sake of their individual beauty and contributing absolutely nothing to move the story forward. In the end i was extremely bored of going through the individual stories, where director tries to forcibly build characters in a very short time and push unnecessary emotions and melodrama. However this effort falls flat as there is no enough time for building each character to feel anything for them or those scenes.<br/><br/>Movie tries in vain to give justice to the each member of the watchmen group, giving them some screen space. But however in a movie of 130 minutes, its almost impossible to do so. What remains in the end is individual stories unrelated at most times and zero significance for the plot, which to me seemed great to build an interesting movie.<br/><br/>So positives: Visuals are great. not all as some look extremely tacky with below average special effects. Atmosphere in the movie is stunning. So is the music, which helps a great deal to keep everything together.<br/><br/>I definitely expected the movie to be a lot better than it is."
"TimBraam69","4","5","10","31 March 2009"," Only read, if you, like me, never read the comics but did watch the movie.
","I watched this movie two weeks ago, me and my friends really felt like going to the movie. We saw the commercial on TV and decided to go to Watchmen. Now you should know that our ages range from 18 to 15. The comics were from far before our time, and we never heard of it either. So if you like us, have never read the comics and look through here to find out if this film is something for you, then let me warn you. I really disliked the movie, it might be because i hate movies based on drama, because that's what Watchmen is. As an 18 year old boy who watched the cool commercial, i expected heroes, nice fighting and great effects. Don't misunderstand me, there were heroes, there were great fights and i've never seen such great effects. I just really really hated the story line, it was confusing, and i felt like nothing really happened during the first one and a half hour. I'll have to tell you, that as you may think, i'm not one of those youngsters that watches Silvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Steven Seagall beat up guys all day. I really like movies which turn my expectations around, even confusing me. But this movie was just boring. I walked away from the cinema, something that i've never done before. My vote which is 4 out of 10, is based on the quality of the film, and how much i liked it. I would seriously give it a 1 out of 10 if not for the quality. The acting is great, the effects are great but the story, well it sucks."
"jzappa","7","5","10","25 March 2009"," A Richly Compelling Experience
","I was skeptical about Zack Snyder as a director before this film. I hated the Dawn of the Dead remake and I thought that 300 was simply an exercise in style and technical mastery with everything else lathered on top. Roughly two hours prior to seeing this film for the first time, I listened to David Edelstein give his review on NPR, saying that Snyder, in showing reverence to the material's roots as a graphic novel, keeps the camera as still as possible and drains the life out of the film. I don't just disagree with Edelstein. I doubt he and I saw the same film. The movie I saw was a masterpiece of spectacle, a liberation of Hollywood style, a richly textured, densely layered epic that boldly inverts all the conventions of superhero movies and comic books. <br/><br/>Due to the American victory in the Vietnam War as a result of commissioning two superheroes, Dr. Manhattan and The Comedian, to fight for the U.S., Richard Nixon is shown to be elected to his third term as President. By 1985, however, he has outlawed masked vigilantes and rising Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union threaten a devastating nuclear war. The film begins in the apartment of Edward Blake, whose identity is revealed soon after his brutal murder. Following this is one of the most inventive and mesmerizing opening credits sequences I have ever seen, a montage of historical scenes painting, almost literally, an alternate history from World War II through the 1980s involving masked heroes. The montage plays ""Times They Are A-Changin'"" sung by Bob Dylan, and includes implicit twists on historical events such as JFK's assassination.<br/><br/>The whodunit of the Comedian's death begins to piece together with a global masterplan. The first phase in the plot may be to eradicate the Watchmen. Unlike the Superman films, for instance, Watchmen understands that it's difficult to profit from the complete devastation of the planet, but there was a nuclear deadlock between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that pressured precisely that.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast of superheroes (almost outnumbered by the amount of bit players prosthetically masquerading as iconic people of the times) are clad in classic comic book costumes. Rorshach's cloth mask, with its constantly fluctuating inkblots, is one of the most fascinating superhero garbs ever, always in constant motion, telegraphing his black-and- white view of the world, and how his views shift depending on the overriding emotion of his given mood.<br/><br/>When I say that I was skeptical of Snyder before, I mean that I felt he didn't quite understand cinema enough to be at the helm of such visionary contributions to it. Dawn of the Dead is screamingly pretentious and 300 is beautiful but shallow. But Watchmen not only leaves such an indelible stylistic impression, but also protects its vision with a certain wisdom concerning starpower. There is hardly a name actor in the film. The most well-known faces in the film are scarce: Billy Crudup is masqueraded entirely in an computer-generated image for the vast majority of his screen time; Carla Gugino has little screen time at all save for scenes that span her character's vast differences in age pertaining to the story. Snyder impresses me here, because he understands that casting major stars in these roles would allow the audience to project their own assumptions of a superstar's persona onto his or her character. And he doesn't want that. He wants these very unique characters to flourish in their own right, and for the actors to serve them, not the other way around.<br/><br/>The Watchmen and their distinguished endowments are all the better capable of seeing how weak they really are, and granting all but Dr. Manhattan are human and on the same side, their capabilities are not infinite. Dr. Manhattan, living apart from time and space, is reasonably detached from the future of our infinitesimal planet.<br/><br/>Watchmen has a philosophy of time and space that is strikingly similar to that of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five. Dr. Manhattan observes his peers knowingly, having learned through his universal superpowers that everything simultaneously exists. Each ""superhero"" is deeply flawed, and their effect on the world can hardly be said to be more positive than negative, or more negative than positive. Their effect simply is. By the end, the Diabolical Masterplan that has been discovered is something that Manhattan claims to understand ""without condoning...or condemning."" There is hardly a way to argue against it, even though one knows how monstrous it is. Such dilemmas preoccupy all the Watchmen, and are exhibited in a film experience of unique, arresting beauty. It might seem unlikely to take solemnly a naked blue man, indeed afforded a penis though no discernible testicles, but Billy Crudup brings a moody distance to Dr. Manhattan that is oddly poignant. Does he recall how it felt to be human?<br/><br/>Watchmen brings remarkable persuasion to these characters. There is even an unsuccessful attempt by two superheroes to have sex, something to which all humans can relate. One masked avenger is a product of superhero rape. I suppose it's needless to say that the film is exuberant enough to be seen more than once. The more one sees it, the more one has to say about it. It's difficult to master all the niceties and connotations, but also difficult not to have a compelling event."
"H_Spengler","10","5","10","22 March 2009"," Watching the Watchmen
","I saw this in IMAX opening weekend, but wanted to wait to write my review until I had re-read the GN, and let my thoughts sink in.<br/><br/>Overall I was blown away at the experience of having virtually every scene lifted perfectly from the GN and translated on screen here. I have a few quibbles, but none of them are large enough to have ruined my experience. God Bless Zack Snyder for sticking so closely to the novel and paying attention to so much detail from the illustrations.<br/><br/>Malin Ackerman may be very pretty to look at, but to me was the weakest character in the film, I didn't care for her too much in the GN, and it hasn't changed much here..like in the GN she was just sort of....there. She's a plot device and little else. <br/><br/>I also wasn't too sure about Matthew Goode, but the more I thought about it the more he grew on me. I thought he depicted just the right amount of arrogance and reasoning/intelligence. <br/><br/>However small her part, I will never view Silk Spectre 1 as anyone else but Carla Gugino. <br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan, was wonderfully portrayed by Billy Crudup, admittedly he was never my favorite character, but seeing him portrayed so accurately on the screen vs. pages of the book, really brought dimension to the inner struggle he has with himself, and rediscovering humanity. Crudup portrays him with just the right amount of subtly.<br/><br/>I liked Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl 2. He did a great job as the bookwormish Dan Dreiberg, likewise as his alter ego. <br/><br/>Jeffrey Dean Morgan was a spectacular Comedian, it's one of the few times I simultaneously despised a character and yet felt sorry for him, even if that is how the character is written, if pulled off incorrectly by the actor and director, it never works. He was the one who ""got the big joke"" long before anyone else did.<br/><br/>But saving the best for last I was completely blown away by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Haley mesmerized me every second he was on the screen, and the scenes he wasn't in, I found myself eagerly anticipating the next one he was. Haley is to Rorschach what Ledger is to the joker. A stunningly deep and dimensional performance.<br/><br/>There were some changes from the novel, but nothing that at least to me were that big of a deal. Missing was the ""giant squid"" which didn't bother me in the least. There are some other minor subplots not included, but for time constraints I can understand. <br/><br/>I could've done without the overlong sex scene though, Not even the GN devotes that many panels to it. In fact, you could cut the whole thing down to ten seconds and not miss anything. I do also, wish they'd devoted a little more time to the back story of Rorschach and to the shrink's interactions with him.<br/><br/>Will definitely be getting this one on DVD 10/10. (*Recommend the ""director's cut"" version on DVD*)<br/><br/>*Just a few side notes. Tired of reading reviews whining about the ""big blue penis"". Get over it! You either have one, or most likely have seen one. If you're letting that be your deciding factor in this movie, you got problems. <br/><br/>**Also, parents, it's rated ""R"" for a reason. Whether or not it's as dark or violent, etc. to other ""R"" movies you've seen. Kids have no business at all being at ANY ""R"" rated movies. Get a sitter, and if you can't find one I guess you'll have to wait for DVD. Stop subjecting very young children on everyone else at the theater, and possibly scarring them with nightmares over material they're too young to understand!

","Most all cultures have dreamed iconic hero figures since the dawn of time. Instead of doomsayers and bards, today we have graphic novels, comic books and movies, and this is a very thoughtful effort at the hero tale, very Greek in that all the heroes have their various flaws, some are quite despicable.<br/><br/>There's too much in the movie to think about. Many of these characters and their situations deserve movies of their own. The music selected is trite. I'm no great fan of Richard Nixon, but the treatment of him and his cabinet is simultaneously tired, offensive and ignorant, making his makeup a grotesque is also gamey and needlessly politicizing. There are tons of continuity/logic issues, but none of them broke through and ruined the suspension of disbelief for me.<br/><br/>That said, this is the best comic book hero movie I've seen. I thought Dark Knight was a snooze compared to this movie, and actually thought about issues raised in this movie's plot after viewing it, rare for such a movie. Couldn't tell you a single thing about Dark Knight other than Heath Ledger was in Dark Knight and Michael Caine sounds like Alfie. Watchmen offers more to think about.<br/><br/>Nothing earthshaking, but certainly didn't regret spending the time or money on this entertaining movie."

","I walked into the movie theatre with absolutely zero background on Watchmen (my comics era is that of Flash and Green Lantern, for those who remember that far back) and that's a blessing. This accentuates my appreciation of how well this complex story is put together for an audience that experiences it for the first time.<br/><br/>The first few sequences are somewhat confusing, with the proliferation of characters, events in a multiple temporal setting. A lesser hand would have driven the audience to unbearable frustration but under the deftly direction of Zack Snyder (who helmed ""300""), the numerous pieces of jigsaw gradually, slowly but surely fit together. Then, along the way comes a few twists, nothing particularly convoluted, but simply nicely done. There is at once a bumpy excitement and a soothing smoothness throughout. Superb story-telling, is this one.<br/><br/>The backdrop is America in the 80s, fictionalized to fit the sci-fi fantasy script, such as Nixon in his fifth term. Thread of nuclear fallout with the Russians is lurking. The ""Watchmen"" is a group of crime-fighting vigilantes who, once hailed, are now falling out of the favour of the public and becomes outlawed. Their responses to the predicament vary  willingly go into oblivion, stubbornly continue, or deviously capitalize on the situation. The story starts with a mysterious murder of one of them, and grows into a global crisis of catastrophic proportion. I wouldn't go into any details. You may already know the story. If you don't, I shouldn't deprive you of the joy I had experienced, of discovering the intricacies as they unfold in the immensely enjoyable 162 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>What I can say is how the movie looks (and sounds), and that is  absolutely fantastic. The CGI is at its very best. And such good action I haven't seen for a long time. One fight sequence reminds me of Trinity and Neo. Grandiose panoramic shots are breathtaking, whether the landscape is imaginary (Mars) or real (Antarctica). Background music is varied and well placed, from ""flower power"" favourite to Wagner's Ride of the Valkries (a clear tribute to ""Apocalypse now"")<br/><br/>Without any notably big star, the ensemble cast comprises of all capable actors. This is quite essential as each character has his/her own story, and requires a portrayal that is above mere superficial line reciting. Billy Crudup, good since ""Almost famous"" and ""Big fish"", plays a scientist who through an accident was transformed into a super-human in the twilight zone of losing his humanity. Matthew Goode, coming from his impressive most recent work ""Brideshead revisited"", is the cleverest man of all who is trying to play God. Jackie Earle Haley (""Winged creatures"") plays a ruthless vigilante horribly depraved from a tragic childhood, but with a relentlessly uncompromising principle. Patrick Wilson (Raoul in ""Phantom of the Opera"") is an atypical superhero, shy and gentle. Fresh as a spring breeze is Swedish beauty Malin Akerman, playing a second-generation Watchman under the shadow of her mother and with a secret surrounding her life. All these actors deliver solid performances that bring their respective characters to life. There are more, quite a few more, secondary characters whose roles are however quite significant.<br/><br/>The dialogues are well written, effective and unpretentious. For a sobering quote, there is a line to the effect that in the scheme of things of the Universe life form is a greatly overrated phenomenon (something like that). For contemporary acid humour, how about ""America doesn't want a cowboy in the White House"" in reference to the possibility of Ronald Reagan being elected president.<br/><br/>I walked into the cinema thinking that this will be another of those no-brainer action thrillers, with no little trepidation on whether I would end up enduring the nearly three hours that follows. After the said nearly three hours, I emerged completely satisfied with the rewarding cinematic experience. I might even watch it again."

","This is perhaps the best comic book movie I have ever seen. Rorschach is the second best character to be brought from comic to screen accurately, to the point where you cannot tell who came first. Only has Christopher Reeve been better as Superman.<br/><br/>This film is just as challenging as the novel, and in some ways better. Of course you cant capture everything in the novel and some things have changed to fit better in the film. But it was an amazing viewing experience.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book, I think you'll enjoy this film a lot. But remember this is not your typical ""superhero"" film. It's much much better.<br/><br/>If you have read it, I think you'll love it even more. We comic fans have been waiting for this film for a long time and it was worth the wait.

"MightyMolecule","Null","5","10","11 March 2009"," Reasons To Disregard This Movie
","First things first.<br/><br/>Clear, cut, and simple: The movie 300 is, was, and will always irrefutably, undeniably, incontestably, without a shadow of a doubt be nothing more than an overly-hyped Gladiator clone. The movie wasn't that big of deal people nor even remotely THAT good of a film to begin with beyond its boring granular video effects and body oil, and has since seemed to have been seriously ushered into ""greatest movies of all time"" lists of worthless morons who have an unfortunate sway on the cinema-going public and possess suspicious levels of closet quasi liberal-art, mythological-homo-erotic taste. This seriously needs to be said because a movie being tauted ""from the creators/producers/whatevers of 300"" really couldn't NOR shouldn't get most with a non-hivemind individuality excited.<br/><br/>With that being said, the graphical novel(s) (aka comic books that adults try to pass off as mature material, that according to them, should be considered heavy, complex stuff simply because it was drawn with nudity, explicit language, and attempts to gloss over topics slightly more realistic than radioactive spiders) that this film has been derived from quite simply, sorry guys/gals, frankly suck. They're not the most celebrated works of all time. They're not going to change your life. The fact that this failed production has been in production for as long as it has is because it does suck and consequently red tape becomes involved when suddenly Marvel realizes it's sitting on a billion-dollar machine and others try to play ""me-too"" film making in a hurry at the last minute.<br/><br/>Beyond the background, the story itself defeats itself with an absolution that perhaps rivals the reality of logic as a whole. You have a bunch of mere ""MTV Real World"" mortals running around in hilarious costumes like jagoffs in a setting that is about 15 years too late, post-poetic introspection/goth a la Maxx/The Crow (in fact I believe the hyped trailer was rolling with an old Pumpkins song from that era) all the while the central protagonist (trust me by definition of central this character is the epitome) is a giant blue cock-toting GOD who can without effort control time and space in its entire.<br/><br/>Reread that last paragraph and explain how there can be a story of ANY form of conflict/tension when you have a being that can control time and space with a blasé boredom. Everything is else is null. Title...introduce dude with absolute omnipresent power...roll credits. Should be about an 11 minute movie. The Big Bang probably took less. Fail."
"ugyenpeljor","10","5","10","11 March 2009"," Justice is coming to all of us, no matter what we do...
","For such a devoted fan of the original comic book as myself, there is simply no word to describe the feeling of excitement that you get when everything you have ever known and loved about the legendary graphic novel comes to life on the silver-screen! It is difficult to compact 12 issues into a single 2 and a half hour movie without jeopardizing the integrity of the story, but Zack Snyder has managed to hit it right where it counts, and make it count! Where to begin? This movie merits so much in terms of the quality of acting, set design, visual effects, and writing. For starters, the acting was overall top-notch and superbly done. Jeff Dean Morgan and Patrick Wilson pulled off their characters of The Comedian and Nite Owl II perfectly and precisely to the book. Billy Crudup delivers a superb performance as the angelic yet apathetic Dr. Manhattan. And Matthew Goode does a surprisingly decent job as Veidt.<br/><br/>But all of them pale in the shadow of the incredible job of playing Rorschach done by Jackie Earl Haley. His is on a league of his own, equal in power and complexity to a similar role performed by the late Heath Ledger almost a year ago. I know it is not within the Academy's usual behavior to recognize comic book movies, the painful lesson learned from The Dark Knight's performance at this years Academy Awards. But know this: such a spectacular yet chilling role as this deserves only the best in recognition. The highlight? The famous opening monologue that first introduces us to this unique character: ""And all the whores and the politicians will look up and shout SAVE US! And I'll look down and whisper NO"".<br/><br/>Some of the supporting cast are also noteworthy, in particular, the roles played by Stephen McHattie and Matt Frewer, as the first Nite Owl and Moloch respectively. All-in-all, a very good job well done on acting.<br/><br/>The visuals are impressive to say the least, with Zack Snyder's realization of a dystopian New York City taken directly from the pages of the comic book. Everything is there, from the Gunga Diner to the Bernies' newspaper stand, to the infamous ""WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN?"" graffiti. A few of the designs from the comic book, most notably Nite Owl II's costume and Dr. Manhattan's martian palace, have been redesigned and enhanced for more effect in the process of translating page onto the bigscreen. And while Zack does indeed use a lot of slo-mo, he does not overdo it the way he did in ""300"", and does put it to good use, most notably, in the amazing montage of opening credits that introduces us to this unique world of an Orwellian 1985.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Watchmen"" is a fitting and very faithful adaptation of what is rightly ""the most celebrated graphic novel of all time"". My only remote complaint would be the choice of soundtrack cover in two scenes, but otherwise, Tyler Bates delivers a top-notch original score. For being only 2 and a half hours, this movie has just about managed to convey most of what the graphic novel is all about: a deep and multi-layered story that seeks to question what indeed is the role of the hero in a decadent American society. That said, I simply cannot wait for the extended 3 hour cut! To conclude, go watch the Watchmen! Graphic novel devotee or new to the series, prepare to have your mind blown away by a story that delves deeper in the horrors and ugliness of the human mind then any typical superhero movie would've dared to go. But be warned: this is not for the faint-hearted!"

","Somewhere in New York City in the year 1985 in a alternate dimension, Richard Nixon is still president and superheroes have existed before they were outlawed for they were once mighty and proud. A former super soldier named The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was brutally murdered mysteriously for he worked for a former superhero group called CrimeBusters as his friends Roschach (Jackie Earle Haley) who is a mysterious blank-faced masked avenger, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a blue-skinned nude god-like being. Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) who is a very sexy crime-fighting babe and the mysterious yet very smart NightOwl (Patrick Wilson) all join together to solve the case of the Comedian's death. They are also trying to find out who is also behind an upcoming government conspiracy that could cause World War III for they must find that perpetrator and stop him or her before it's too late.<br/><br/>Co-starring Matt Frewer, This is a brilliant adaptation of the ultimate graphic novel in Existence known as ""Watchmen"" from Alan Moore and David Gibbons including DC comics. After years of development hell since 1986, it seems Warner with Paramount and DC films have green-lighted the film in 2006 after Zack Sydner's ""300"" was a major success including an excellent adaptation of a graphic novel was signed on as director who was a big fan of the ""Watchmen"" graphic novel as he even studied it as storyboards for the film. The film does have the spirit of the comics's satire on politics and superheroes as it takes the audience into an alternate world unlike anyone has ever seen before since ""The Matrix"". The film is quite a complex yet provocative film just like the graphic novel but this superhero movie sure ain't one for kids cause this one is rated R for good reason folks due to some language, nudity, sexuality and graphic gory violence but more of a grown-up's superhero movie. Greg Cannom's make-up effects are just superb including the visual effects with action sequences, i think this is Zack Sydner's greatest motion picture yet and one of the true comic book to movie greats in recent memory.<br/><br/>Although the ending was changed, it doesn't matter cause i think this movie delivers some stuff that fans would crave. The acting was even solid too including the action, i give thanks to Zack Sydner and Co to bring the beloved graphic novel to the big screen in a successful way. I can't wait for the extended cut Blu-Ray which should rock and even make the movie be more better to some audiences."
"fung0","9","5","10","11 March 2009"," A deeply human adaptation
","As a huge fan of the graphic novel, I have to say that Zack Snyder has done about as good a job with this movie adaptation as was humanly possible. Yes, some elements were left out, but the omissions were wisely chosen. Yes, a few elements were modified. But again, the changes were done with enormous care and intelligence. In at least one case - the ending - I felt the film's (quite minor) modification was arguably superior to Alan Moore's original version. (It eliminates one factor that really has no other point of contact in the story, and substitutes a new irony that I think Moore himself might have appreciated.)<br/><br/>What really won me over, though, was the human element. The largely unknown actors chosen to portray The Comedian, Night Owl, Silk Specter II and Rorschach not only look *uncannily* like the characters in the comic, they do an excellent job of fleshing them out. Carla Gugino deserves special note for her great portrayal of the aging Silk Specter I, and Matt Frewer is absolutely perfect as Moloch. And Billy Crudup handles the vague and disinterested Dr Manhattan with just the right subtlety. All of these actors deliver performances that are appropriately stylized, yet deeply human; they bring these characters to life for me in a way that static images on a page simply cannot.<br/><br/>Largely because of this, I found that the movie quickly won me over. Not only as a worthwhile illumination of the comic book, but as a credible work in its own right. At first, I kept comparing each scene with its comic-book equivalent; but after about twenty minutes, I was swept up by the film and felt almost as though I were watching an entirely new creation.<br/><br/>Visually, Watchmen does stay very close to Gibbons' original illustrations, but without being slavish about it. Scenes are allowed to flow and move cinematically, much more than in previous comic adaptations such as Sin City and Snyder's own 300. This really brings the comic to life and opens it up for the big screen, while leaving Gibbons' strange color palette and peculiar compositions clearly evident.<br/><br/>Reading previous reviews, I sense disappointment from those who were seeking a slam-bang ""superhero"" movie, akin to Dark Knight or Spider-Man. Of course, nothing could possibly have been further from Alan Moore's darkly cynical vision. Watchmen isn't about the action itself, but the motives behind it - something largely taken for granted by superhero comics. When these 'heroes' go into action, we're meant to not just feel their exhilaration, but also to question the brooding subconscious desires that drive it. (Not to mention the urges that fuel our own vicarious enjoyment.) What if 'The Dark Knight' *wasn't* pure in spirit, but was tainted by the same perverse passions that we see in ourselves? Unlike the Wachowski Brothers' superficial interpretation of ""V for Vendetta,"" Snyder's Watchmen deserves credit for ducking none of Moore's toughest, most unsettling questions.<br/><br/>The original remains the original, of course. Everyone should read Moore and Gibbons' masterpiece. But while Snyder's Watchmen may shine largely with borrowed brilliance, it does shine very brightly indeed."

","Whether or not you have read these comics or any other, this movie was not a well done comic movie. It was way too long and as most epics keep you in your seat for nearly 3 hours, they need to keep you entertained for this long. However, this is not the case. <br/><br/>This movie also had a lot of slow time, boring. I was in a good mood, ready for a good long movie, and it just never came through for me. My Fiancée wanted to leave, but the investment of time warranted us to see the ending.

Watch Ironman and see a real 10....well that's really only a 9, but still much better. And be critical not just a fan.

"situationuniverse","6","5","10","8 March 2009"," Not up to scratch
","Alan Moore's hate/hate relationship with Hollywood is common knowledge. When they adapt his work, not only does he insist that his name is taken from the credits, but he also rejects any royalties he's due. After lacklustre efforts like From Hell and V for Vendetta and the downright abysmal League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, who can blame the man? Can Zack Snyder buck the trend and adapt works that the author himself deems un-adaptable?<br/><br/>The story, set in an alternate universe where Nixon is still President and the yanks won in Vietnam, concerns a group of out-of-work masked heroes called the Watchmen, unable to save the day due to a new law. <br/><br/>Most have moved on, retired or found other outlets for their skills. One of them, though, refuses to stop. A man in an ink-blot mask and a Mickey Spillane trenchcoat; Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). The closest thing to a protagonist in the film, he follows the clues after the brutal murder of another hero, the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan).<br/><br/>In the background there are several sub-plots running concurrently. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the only super-powered hero of the group is working on a self-sustaining power source to solve the world's energy needs. He's working with the world's smartest and wealthiest man, Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), who may have ulterior motives of his own. <br/><br/>Invested in his work and removed from society by his god like powers, Dr. Manhattan is slowly losing his human empathy. The same reason his girlfriend Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) is falling out of love with him. She finds solace in the arms of Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) an impotent batman like hero, who barely conceals his lust for action.<br/><br/>As the world heads towards Nuclear Disaster, the heroes must forget their differences and unite. But to save humanity from itself, sacrifices must be made.<br/><br/>The Labyrinthine plot strands make it hard to keep track of any single story, even if you have read the book. At least when you're reading it, you can put it down for five minutes. It requires all of your brain power and a lot of enthusiasm for the story to watch the three hour long movie. So intense is it, that you actually feel yourself tiring halfway through. The first act runs for at least an hour, introducing characters and their relationships. Cutting back in time at will, to give you each one's origin story. You're left willing the film to take shape and head in one particular direction, not dozens all at once.<br/><br/>Snyder makes a few mistakes that really jar. His use of music is poorly founded, playing entire tracks over scenes that don't need it. The over long sex scene between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre comes to mind. I mean Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen may be ironic for an impotent character finally getting it up, but it doesn't fit the mood.<br/><br/>He also seems to splash around some random acts of extreme violence to remind the audience that this is a strictly adult Superhero movie, ensuring himself an 18 certificate. He never really finds the right tone for the movie, instead adopting them all. For instance, is it supposed to be humorous or serious? The book was so much larger than life that the irony positively dripped from the page, but here he humanises the characters too much leaving us confused.<br/><br/>The acting is average almost all the way round. The only stand out performance was Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. A Travis Bickle character who's seen too much misery and left his humanity in the gutter. When he's captured and put in prison with so many of the criminals he put away, the film hits an all time high. The scenes strike a perfect balance between ironic humour and gritty all out violence. But I always had time for Rorschach, so maybe I'm biased.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder can't be blamed entirely. The man obviously loves the source material and gives it his best shot. It's just clearly too big a project for him after only two films. Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass, both more experienced directors, have abandoned the story as unfilmable. Maybe Alan Moore was right after all.<br/><br/>Verdict 6/10 A brilliant book, but it makes a poor film."

Shame for the filmmakers who reveled in the gratuitous violence which served no purpose other than to make the protagonists seem like psychopaths. Shame for the marketers of this movie who had my third grade students eager to see it, when it clearly is NOT FOR KIDS.<br/><br/>I felt shame for a culture so desensitized to violence to the point where this stuff almost seems normal. <br/><br/>I hope this dumb movie doesn't kill off the superhero genre. Few of the characters were super, and none of them were heroic. They were just annoying, meandering, and sociopathic.<br/><br/>The ultimate effect of seeing this movie is to feel demoralized, depressed, and exhausted after its too-long length.

"gordonthegorilla","8","5","10","6 March 2009"," Very good, but...
","Overall I enjoyed it, but have a few bones to pick with Zack Snyder. <br/><br/>I definitely didn't like Snyder throwing so much of his own sensibilities into the mix. The gratuitous gore & sex cheapened the whole thing for me, when the beauty of the comic is that it never relied on those things (as most others do).<br/><br/>I appreciate you can't tell every part of the Watchmen story in a film, but in a film battling against massive running time the decision to expand the fighting & screwing, whilst pruning back story elements one after the other was really disrespectful to the source material.<br/><br/>""Who cares about Alan Moore's subplots, just give me tits!"" seemed to be the attitude. And we got tits. Malin Akerman's. They were nice. Pity the rest of the time it felt like she was reading her lines off cue cards without thinking about what the words meant.<br/><br/>And the fighting was corny! A gang of 20 dudes coming at Dan & Laurie one at a time then flopping on the ground idiotically when punched or kicked, with the occasional graphic injury edited in, was just too much like B grade kung-fu for me. <br/><br/>The goodies bashed up the baddies so easily - there was never any danger or the feeling of anything being at stake - the extra fighting was a waste of screen time, when so many subtle story points were skimmed over too quickly or removed altogether.<br/><br/>Another thing - Doc Manhattan's mouth. If only they put as much effort into animating his mouth movements as they put into animating his jiggling schlong... When the mouth is the only thing moving, the centre of attention on an otherwise expressionless face, the animation needs to be PERFECT. It wasn't. It stood out like dog's balls...<br/><br/>Jeez, this review makes it sound like I hated it - I didn't. I'm just a little disappointed that the ultimate anti-superhero story ended up having a bunch of cheap corny crap creep into it & wasn't given the attention to detail it deserved.<br/><br/>Thankfully the material was strong enough to keep this film out of the toilet. The central concept - a massive disaster uniting feuding superpowers into peace - stayed intact & was well executed. <br/><br/>The exception to my complaint about the dumb fights is the opening scene where the Comedian dies - that was really awesome. Another highlight is the actor that played Rorschach - he absolutely nailed it! His line in prison as he's being taken away after burning that dude with hot oil... Just perfect!<br/><br/>The bulk of the film is really solid. Weigh it all up, average it out & you've got a good movie. What prevents me from describing it as a great movie is that a fuller story could have been told in the several minutes of screen time that Snyder wastes on stupid fights, gore & unnecessary sex...<br/><br/>And I'm a filthy bastard who normally loves that stuff! It just doesn't belong in Watchmen."

Completely shallow characters 6. No one is likable. In fact the majority of the ""superhero"" characters are utterly vile and detestable serial killer types. One of them shoots a pregnant woman at point blank range! 7. There is practically no story line whatsoever. 8. It takes vile aspects of life and strings them together into a dull and depressing stream of events that don't relate to each other.<br/><br/>This is not a hero film, it is a film about negativity and fear. Do not expect this to be something like Dark Knight, Sin City or The Matrix. Those are films known for their dark nature but they are also quality films with a message and style that is unique and appealing. The Watchmen has none of this at all. It is devoid of meaning or value.<br/><br/>I would imagine that people with deep mental health problems may get some kind of sick pleasure from this film. Maybe someone who likes illegal films like snuff movies would like this.<br/><br/>There is no point to this film and it will leave you completely and utterly empty and possibly even suicidal. There is practically no storyline whatsoever; it is just a string of increasingly more depressing and pointless events designed to make you feel sick and miserable.<br/><br/>If you find this film entertaining then please admit yourself to a mental hospital and preferably stay there. I have always completely disagreed with capital punishment but I would possibly make an exception for the creators and producers of this film.

Unfortunately, I feel that going to see this movie was a waste of my money and time. Yeah, cinematically it looked good, but there were some serious flaws that made me hate having wasted time I could have spent studying watching this. First, last I checked, male frontal nudity was still taboo. Yeah, I heard about that before I actually went to see this, but it's still gross. Second, seriously, blowing people up, that graphically, wasn't exactly appealing, maybe that's more a critique on whatever (book or comic book, I think I've heard both) this was based off of. Also, hey, lets throw in some pointless scenes here and there.<br/><br/>In summary, i think this was just a bunch of ""pretty"" cinematic computer graphics. I gained nothing but a bad mood from watching it."
"lucasfortini","1","6","13","15 March 2009"," horrible slow drama marketed as action movie
","All I could say after I left the movie theater was 'they got me'.. I mean, the movie was nothing like all the trailers and ads seen everywhere. I know some of the fanboy reviews are defending the movie and saying that it is not a super hero movie, but a 'anti-hero' movie. That would be perfectly fine if they had marketed it as such. I would have stayed at home and wasted my time.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, if you are not a graphic novel fanboy, stay at home or go do something else. Really, I beg of you. <br/><br/>Some caveats to my review: -I did not read the novel and can say I never will. -I am not prudish or conservative at all (so much so, the glowing genitalia did not distract me, nor bothered me), but the sex and graphic violence just felt awkwardly placed and mostly unnecessary."

","I'm sure many other people have summarized things well, so I'll keep mine brief: This was a great movie, lived up to the hype, and I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>It stayed true to the comic, and I was really pleased they didn't try to tack some cruddy 'happy happy joy joy' Hollywood ending on it. Heck, even my girlfriend was going on about how much she enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Also, I was concerned that my girlfriend, who hadn't read the comic, wold be lost, but this was not the case. The movie takes the time to explain everything in detail, and the background of each character is nicely done."

","This movie was probably hands down one of the worst films i have ever seen. Everything from the run time, to the costumes. Horrible. After sitting through the 2 hr 45 minute movie, i left not knowing A.) what the movie was about. B.) a Single Characters name. C.) and the drive to ever see a superhero movie again. The cast was poorly selected (having little/no acting skill, and all lacked a ""super hero"" look). Considering this movie was highly advertised and publicized on every medium, I seriously caution anyone spending their money on this one. If you have the willingness to sit still through the super slow and drawn out scenes, the awkward sex scenes, and the repeated showing of a glowing penis, then i wish you well."
"Th3rdpwr","3","6","13","7 March 2009"," Inconsistantly pedestrian....
","To say I was disappointed in 'Watchmen' would presume that there were certain expectations. Having read Alan Moore's literary work during its original release, and again very recently, I was never under the impression that the comic would make it to the screen significantly unchanged. So, I approached with an open mind and found Zack Snyder's interpretation sorely lacking. When adapting literature for the movies, what you leave out and/or rearrange determines the difference between acceptance or rejection. I'm afraid Snyder failed, and created a work of stilted, uneven narrative. While having some interesting moments, the Director misstepped at almost every level; In spite of having numerous political figures (in heavy, distracting make up) telling us of impending Armageddon, there is little real feeling of the ""inevitable"" worldwide destruction; instead of a city which should bring to mind Tim Burton's Gotham City, it looked more like '40's New York. Character development was often sketchy, as Snyder had to decide what should be left out and what shouldn't; this lack of development limited the impact of certain key moments throughout the picture; as when Rorschach reveals an uncharacteristic moment of appreciation to Nite Owl; their history's as former partners in arms is glossed over, and Nite Owl's tirade (which fails to mention their friendship), makes the Rorschach moment seem strained; Silver Specter's discovery has little shock value, since the relationship between two other important characters was not adequately explored, and key information revealed at the moment of discovery. The actor's don't seem to understand their parts, bringing little to the table, coming across as playing the characters rather than being them; Snyder shows us his weakness is character development (his previous efforts required little) and is unable to bring it out of his actors. However, if there is one big flaw, it's Snyder's failure to demonstrate how much the past informs the present, in Watchmen; the two, in effect, existing almost simultaneously; he seems to miss the small things that impact the larger events. Unable to completely free himself, the Director is most successful at the more straightforward moments of superhero action, demonstrating why these people were heroes to begin with. Much of 'Watchmen' comes across as mechanical and distant, rather than dark or ominous. The final reveal is so changed, explained by the most underdeveloped character, and so truncated that I barely understood the significance of the plan to this person; it was as if Snyder himself didn't understand what Moore had written at that point; his ending change was unimaginative, common. The final minute of the film punctuates its problems, when two characters (who existed throughout the comic, but nowhere in the film) hint that the story may be far from over. In the final analysis, I can give Zack Snyder no slack for this pedestrian work; he knew what he was getting into."

","I have been waiting for this movie to come out since i first saw the trailer for it at the dark knight. This is probably the most disappointing film that i am ever seen. Me and three friends were all excited to see it and had been planing on it for a week and were all hyped up for it but then there was nothing. The action scenes were pretty cool but thats about it for the first 2 hours. The first two hours were very boring and i strugled to stay awake. The plot finally developed with 45 minutes late. I suggest that you should come for the last 45 minutes for a good film or just not waste your time and money. This movie also had the worst soundtrack ever."
"Fishdoggie","Null","6","13","7 March 2009"," Terrible
","Scenes with action in them of any sort.....8 Scenes with totally naked men in them..... 17. Not exactly the ratio I'm looking for in a movie. I haven't seen this much nudity in any movie in my life this side of full Porn. Some of it perhaps was needed storyline wise, but much wasn't. The trailers lead me to believe this would indeed be the Dark Knight, Spiderman, Ironman, something, some movie about comic book heroes that was action packed. Nothing could be further from the truth. This was a drama, a long, boring, drama with 20% of the action you'd find in your normal spy movie. I definitely don't recommend it to anyone looking for a good summer action movie, it's definitely not."
"action-man101","5","6","13","7 March 2009"," Watchmen
","Based on the cult 80's graphic novel (comic book to you and me). This is one superhero flick that is definitely not for kids, hence its 18 rating. Re-invents the genre in a film that was widely believed to be unfilmable. Set in an alternate 1985, in which America won the Vietnam war and Richard Nixon is still President, it shows us a group of sad, depressed ex-superheros known as ""Watchmen"" in a world that has abandoned them - because lets face it who needs a masked weirdo running around in spandex? There is a welcome change of pace from other comic book adaptations as the ""heroes"" are shown to be very human. There are also moments of dark humour such as the prison scenes and the nostalgic opening showing other masked heroes and their eventual downfall. Unfortunately the film bites off more than it can chew but the main problem is that it gives us no one to root for. The Watchmen are more like a group of sociopaths who need locking up - in one case one of them shoots dead a pregnant woman!?! Another hurdle is that for the majority of the film there isn't even a villain for them to fight - at least until the final 20 mins (which stretches credibility) and the identity of the baddie is revealed to the surprise of no one. Billy Crudup's character of Dr. Manhattan who for some reason walks around the whole film stark naked is one of the dullest characters I've ever seen in a movie of this type. He looks like a member of the Blue Man Group who decided to stop performing with his chums and become a flasher. The film is around 45 mins too long as a result of non-linear writing which results in a lot of time wasting. Plus points are the demented Roarshack who steals every scene in his ever-changing ink blot mask, and the gorgeous Malik Akerman who is a dead-ringer for Lucy Lawless. But these are few and far between."
"bob the moo","Null","8","19","9 March 2009"," Not a great film in and of itself but a very good physical reproduction of the book
","With something like this it is always worth knowing what the viewer knows of Watchmen in order to contextualise the opinions one gets. For example I would like to know if you own every possible edition of Watchmen and read it once a week and twice in the week you go to the annual Watchmen convention. Conversely did you not know it was based on anything and just went into this screening because you missed the start of Bride Wars by ten minutes and worried you would not be able to follow it. These things matter they don't mean anyone is right and wrong, but it has meaning. For example, for me, I like the comic book. Not enough to get snotty about people not calling it a graphic novel, but I enjoyed it, thought the plot and characters were interesting and thought that it did work well as a comic with the additional text sections providing a lot to the panels.<br/><br/>I found that I quite liked the film then, because it sticks close to the book, and the book is of value and quality. Some things are dropped, some things done differently and some things changed but it doesn't impact much on the film, although I'm sure the message boards will be rammed with people who disagree. The problem with this is that the film itself is not great as a film which is how the majority of people will be coming to it. It sticks so closely to the source material that the characters retain a certain lack of depth that comes with it. Sure, they do everything required within the original material but they also feel a bit limited by it as well and end up a little stiff as a result. In line with this, the film also has a very serious edge that comes over as being a bit ponderous rather than anything else. This is a shame but it does generally come as a result of how fearful the film seems to be of moving too far from the source. Film is a different media from the graphic novel and it should be different in terms of how it does the same things (at least a little).<br/><br/>Limited to the panels in the strip, Synder doesn't really manage to explore the themes and make the most of some aspects of the story and characters. The moral and physiological make-ups of our ""heroes"" are not really explored or developed so much as they are laid out in a few moments. This is similar to the book of course but what works there doesn't work as well here because this moving, flowing version required a bit more development that we got. Likewise, other than making sure the film looks like an alternative 1980's and that the politicians look like Nixon, Kissinger etc, it doesn't do anything with the setting in terms of satire or commentary. Again this will not bother those looking for a straight reproduction of the film (although if you're that petty then the other changes will) but it does feel like it is all missing and I'm guessing that the casual viewer will wonder what the fuss is all about because there seems to be lots of characters and lots of plot but that it is all lacking depth and frankly takes itself all a bit seriously considering how stiff it is.<br/><br/>Synder's direction is good visually though and for me I enjoyed being told a story I was already familiar with but on a big screen with the characters brought to life. OK he doesn't develop much of it but it still looks good and packs a punch. Occasionally he makes bad visual decisions (the sex scene in particular is awful) but mostly he is faithful and reproduces the material well. The use of music, it must be said, is awful. Not the songs themselves (they are good) but how they are used  when they work it is only because what they are over is working despite of the music (the opening credits are great even if the Dylan song is clunkingly obvious) but mostly they are just dropped onto the film without any impact other than being a recognisable song  many do not fit in terms of tone or period and it is jarring throughout.<br/><br/>Generally it must be said that the performances are solid rather than impressive. Most of them fit the characters well and it suggests this was the aim of the casting process because in this regard it worked. Haley is a good Rorschach. OK his narration is limited in terms of material and delivery but both still work and he was the Rorschach I have in my head. The moral simplicity of his character does make his job easier though in the same way as Morgan's Comedian and Crudup's Manhattan are ""easier"" to deliver straight. Akerman, Goode, Wilson, Gugino and a few others are not as fortunate though because their characters are more complex but they do not have the freedom to move within their material to show this or explore this. As a result they come off looking a lot stiffer even though they are no better or worse than the others. Again the main fault probably lies with Synder because one gets the impression that his direction of their performances was to point at the animated panels and say ""do that"".<br/><br/>So as a moving, live-action reproduction of the animated sections of the book it is perfectly fine and I enjoyed it. However as a film it is only OK because it is limited by the lack of development and exploration of themes and characters, seemingly led by the fear of messing with the material to any great extent. Far from the classic many are hailing but yet also not the piece of rubbish that many will say when the backlash begins in earnest."

Two groups of people in the theatre flat out walked out during the movie, and my friend and I tried to stay awake. I agreed with another reviewer how 1/2 an hour of the movie just consisted of the same flashbacks over and over. The plot, sense, and dialogue of the movie was just kind of blah. Most acting was blah. The OK/good acting was the blue guy and Rorshak (spelling.) Movie sometimes appears to be a big corny mess. Makeup is pretty bad, especially on Nixon, their fake wigs, etc. Song selection for the movie was sometimes off. Another corny thing is how Laurie/Spectre has sex in her thigh high spiky heel hooker boots hehe. The sex scenes weren't that great. This movie is a clutter mess. :o( I like other Superhero movies: Batman, X-Men, Spiderman, V for Vendetta, etc; just not this one. What a bore. Don't believe the hype.

"mitchimitch1111","9","7","16","9 March 2009"," Watchmen Review (SPOILERS)
","I recently saw the movie ""Watchmen"" with two friends, and this is what I have to say about it. I am currently half way through the book, and I have to say that, so far, the movie matches up perfectly. Every street sign, and every book can be spotted on the set. I loved the reference to the book ""Under the Hood."" In the opening credits, you can clearly see the stack of books with the same title. The opening credits were very good, although they lasted WAY too long. Every time they did a transition I asked myself ""Is it starting yet?"" Many people know that CGI was used on ""Watchmen"" (the same technology was used on ""300""). The effects were VERY, VERY good. The scene were Jon Osterman is disintegrated is so genuinely done. They even had the hair on his arms stand up to show his fear and the process that is happening. Although this scene was good, the use of slow-motion in the rest of the film was WAY over done. Every 3 seconds something would move in slow-mo. Another thing I would like to comment on is when Dr. Manhattan is on Mars and he makes all of the cogs come out of the ground. That was very well done.<br/><br/>I thought that the costumes were a little bit cheesy. Silk Spectre II's was probably the most pleasing costume, because it wasn't entirely super-hero-ish. The Comedian's costume is also very good.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, this movie was great! Malin Akerman made a perfect Silk Spectre II. She really dedicated her life to this role and it showed. I personally hate the show ""Gray's Anatomy"" and I hated Jeffrey Dean Morgan on it, but he really out-did himself as The Comedian(Edward Blake). From his evil looks, to his devilish laughs, he made the movie seem ""real"". Jackie Earl Haley is the only character I have a complaint about. When he had his ""face"" on, he sort-of over did the Rorschach voice. It sounded almost like he had throat cancer. But, in the interrogation scene, the way he responds to the pictures is outstanding! Also, in the scene where he is killed by Dr. Manhattan, his facial expressions and the the way he dramatizes the lines is AMAZING! <br/><br/>All in all, ""Watchmen"" is a GREAT movie, with very few flaws. In my opinion, if ""The Dark Knight"" was Oscar worthy, so is this. ""Watchmen"" beats The Batman series by a LONG-SHOT! If you have not yet seen this movie, see it. It will absolutely blow you away."

Just consider of Watchmen releasing today and the 1billion mark it would have crossed and thus would have become the best movie of all time. I still value what Christopher Nolan said about Watchmen Zack Snyder because it is damned truth.<br/><br/>Coming back to the movie, if you are thinking to watch it with kids, or as a kid you are going then stop right now as it is strong potent to the harsh realities of this human world and also it has scenes that might not get into right kind of mind of kids.<br/><br/>The film is gold and can never be repeated or remade as it is once done so great that it remains best and untouchable. Every department is well studied and handled whether it is color esthetics, realism to the real world, visuals, tone, design, casting and performances and above the rightful adaptation of the comics by Alan Moore and his team. The film never goes into the typical, cliched and run of the mill superhero genre and instead keeps it around to a detective story where being a superhero is a curse and perfection is a distant dream like peace and goodness. The film also touches on topics that we all chose to ignore yet suffer from because if we dont talk, somebody should and here film does exceptionally well. The film has made itself so great that I think the new HBO series will never stand close to this version of the comics ever.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to watch the film and then go on ranting by comparing it to the Marvel and recent and new DC iterations, then dont watch because this film predates everything even Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and also Joker (2019). And, instead watch this movie with fresh eyes and love it like your heart is fallen in love for the first time."

","Contains plot details some may consider spoilers.<br/><br/>There is a lot of Superhero action in this movie. The who-dun-it aspect is simple to figure out. What really bogs the movie down is the stiff acting by everyone and the ever constant heavy themes of blurring good and evil. I ask you, can the Watchmen really be good guys if they allow Nixon to become president 5 terms and disco music to survive?<br/><br/>The movie does a poor job of introducing the characters. You are fed a pseudo history of the US with Watchmen during the opening credits. Once Bob Dylan is done playing, the movie starts and you are confused who the characters are. The relationship of the characters and their past deeds are relayed through flashback scenes, which in many cases were more interesting than the rest of the movie. The lack of character introduction wasn't as bad as ""Final Fantasy VII"" movie, but it is worse than what Tolkien did to us.<br/><br/>The Superheros, a vigilante group who murder women and children for their country (an early good/evil blur) are semi-retired as wearing masks became outlawed. Someone is killing off the Superheros and superhero Rorschach is the most determined to find out.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan (big blue guy, clothes optional) can't see into his future and has assumed we have annihilated each other. Meanwhile, Nixon and Kissinger are in the war room, in a scene which reminds us of Dr. Strangelove. They are debating a first strike.<br/><br/>If you like your superhero action mixed in with pseudo history, political statements, blurred good/evil themes/ atheist statements (The watch has no watch maker), and the slinky Silk Spectre being zipped out of her costume (some nudity) then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>If you like good acting, a well written chronological story, good dialogue, and a need to know the characters, and capable film editors go elsewhere."
"Screen_Blitz","5","3","5","16 February 2016"," Powerful on visuals and performances, deeply flawed on storytelling
","From director Zack Snyder, the man behind the visually stunning historical epic '300', comes a dark, complex vigilante thriller based on the acclaimed comic book series by DC comics. This film set in 1985 during the height of the Cold War, follows a league of superheros: masked vigilante Rorschach (played by Jackie Earle Haley), techno expertise Nite Owl II (played by Patrick Wilson), glowing blue- skinned being Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Cruddup), Silk Spectre II (played by Malin Akerman), and former black-ops specialist known as The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan); who are shut down by the government after a political meltdown. However, when one of their former members is brutally murdered, the superheros step out of retirement to solve the mystery behind the criminal responsible of this horrendous act. On the other hand, their investigation is challenged when tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union heat up to the point of an anticipated nuclear world that is set to devastate the world.<br/><br/>This is not your average superhero film that some come to expect. Instead of glamorizing with flashy action sequences and profound special effects, this film conveys a dark tone that makes even other DC films like the Dark Knight trilogy seem light-hearted, and dwells heavily on plot development with action making up only a minority of the storyline. This film, however, juggles two stories at the same time; one centering on the band of superheroes going under investigation of a murder of one of their own, and the other revolving around a looming global disaster by a nuclear war between two rivaling countries, with plenty of political and historical commentary, much of which is introduced in slow motion cut-outs during the opening credits with Bob Dylan's popular song "" The Times They Are Changin"" playing. The result, unfortunately, is one bloated plot that transcends into a convoluted mess. The plot move at a significantly slow pace and we are left with plenty of plot elements that never seem to add up. The connection between the government conspiracy and the murder of one of the former Watchmen is left unclear, or at least understated. Along the side, the story tosses numerous subplots to the table that fail to fit in with the main story, especially the ones dealing with the Cold War conflicts including the Vietnam War. Many may the impressive visual effects and the occasional bloody action scenes that upload in various points of the runtime. Some of the futuristic and fantasy imagery serves as eye-candy in many scenes including the stunning CGI on Dr. Manhattan's body. The performances by the cast are decent, especially by Billy Cruddup who plays Dr. Manhattan, which delivers some redeeming value to the film.<br/><br/>Watchmen is by no means a bad film but rather one that is terribly misguided. While the visuals and performances stand strong, the film suffers greatly in terms of storytelling, thus lacking the spirit of Zack Snyder's other works. The overly complex plot may appeal to some whether or not they are able to comprehend it, but leave others sorely disappointed."

","First of all, is the movie better than the Graphic novel. No, but what movie is better than the book or comic version. The reason that this movie is just so legendary is that it's bold move for mainstream movies. Its actually the only film to be almost (I said almost) exactly like the Greatest Graphic Novel of all times. Of course the novel is pretty long so they had to cut a few things, but the main important things are there. Also, the movie had the perfect amount of visual effect (not like Avatar, that was exaggerated) to just be blown away. I also enjoyed the concept of killing your enemy instead of knocking them out and putting them in jail. Newsflash: they escape and usually want revenge. The music was fantastic, especially Philip Glass song Priut Igoe and Prophecies. Acting was A plus work by Jackie Earle Haley who played Roarshach, Billy Crudup-Dr.Manhattan, and Jefferey Dean Morgan- the Comedian. The story was one of a kind and the ending for the movie was way better than that of the comic. The only mistake was to put Hallejuh soundtrack during a sex scene but other than that this was a perfect movie in every way. Totally should have won the Academy Awards."

I knew I'd have difficulty with it having no named Hollywood stars to draw me into the characters. The acting was okay but how good an actor do you have to be to say most of the dialog. I have to agree with those who say sometimes sticking strictly to the comic is a mistake. Cronenberg took a graphic novel ie History of Violence and gave a cohesive story with a character, Tom Stahl, that we could root for. This is a disconnected group of people none of whom have any redeeming values and we're suppose to think that's great because they're 'real human beings'. Well being a hero isn't about being a human being, its about being more than you think you could be, and I don't mean more self serving.<br/><br/>The visuals were okay but the fight scenes were overly stylized, violent and make these so called non superheroes look like they had real powers.

","This movie is simply the best superhero movie in the world. It combines amazing story telling with superb special effects and action sequences. <br/><br/>Why is there so much hate on this movie?<br/><br/>What's not to like about a perfect narrative, perfect and brutally satisfying fight sequences, combined with awesome acting and some pretty decent twists? To me this is the best superhero film to date. <br/><br/>But if you're going into this expecting something like the avengers or a funny, jolly, happy movie, you will be shocked. <br/><br/>This movie is dark as sh*t and that's partially to do with why it's so good. It stays true to the comics, keeping the very gritty tone and combining it with subtle comedy that doesn't seem forced. For a long movie, it does seem to fly pretty quickly and fluently. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend Watchmen to anyone who loves a superhero movie, or doesn't, for it is in one of my top 10s of all time..."

","I find the credit sequence is the only good part of the movie, and even that is awful. Who are these people dressed as superheroes found dead in doorways or hauled off to asylums? They appear able to leap out of planes and land unharmed, pick up other people to toss them around and punch through brick walls, but have no origin stories, except for Doctor Manhattan. His origin story apparently takes place in an alternate-alternate-timeline where humanity never invented the circuit breaker. He's trapped in an atomic machine with no off switch? Nothing about this movie makes any sense and the characters are not interesting at all."

","One of the worst titles I have ever seen! The story was lost in all the blood in it. I didn't get it (may be it is my fault). I like films about super heroes, but not this one. The end was unexpected (I admit that), there are some good sentences that people can learn, but... I didn't like the director's point of view. There was too much darkness. Like forgetting for the script and redeem it with battles and killing. Too much pessimism in a story about heroes. This is my point of view. It was different from other super heroes pictures. Different in a way I didn't like. It was like watching a storm on the sky, you see sometimes rays of light, but after all it still remains an awful storm, leaving you in bad mood. Sorry!"
"david-j-morehouse","2","4","8","13 August 2009"," Wow, what a ...
",".... sprawling mess of a movie. Watched the director's cut of this thing, and I have to say it's one of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while. Not because of the acting or special effects or any of that--no, it was hands down the most convoluted and ridiculous adaptations of a graphic novel I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I remember reading the Watchmen graphic novel back when I was in college. Thought it was pretty cool, but then again, I was only 19 or so. Now, I have to say, whatever the graphic novel had to offer then, it's been completely bastardized by this movie. It tries so hard to be grand and edgy and full of odd topicality, that it ends up just becoming a parody of itself. I mean, who the *f* really cares what happens with Dr. Manhattan and why he is exiled to another planet? So what if Ms. Jupiter or whatever the *f* she's called finds out her dad is the *f'n* Comedian? And so Mr. Smartypants manages to save the world through some obscene plot that involves pinning the murder of millions on the blue head of Dr. Manhattan? So what! And the godlike cypher decides to run off to some other galaxy to create maybe even life itself. How *f'n* grandiose and at the same time inconsequential!<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm trying to think of anything that really redeems this movie, and I'm only coming up w/ bupkis. Bupkis, I tell you!<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention the over-the-top graphic violence? I'm usually not one to give a damn about such things, but even this was too much for me. Totally gratuitous. Avoid this degenerate, costumed freak show at all costs."

"aid_h6","9","4","8","26 July 2009"," Favourite movie, ever.
","I was not a Watchmen fan heading into the theater, but I sure as hell was one leaving. Prior to Watchmen, the recent remake of Casino Royale. If you enjoyed that one a few years back, this is definitely a more over the top, yet maturer type of movie.<br/><br/>If you are hoping that this is going to be another huge superhero hit like Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. Watchmen barely qualifies as a superhero movie. The movie does not revolve around a single antagonist like other superhero movies. In this movie, bad guys get pounded senseless, regardless of their physique.<br/><br/>The plot is very well thought out, but the issue was filming it. Because all of the heroes had to have their origins covered in flashbacks. And this is where Zack Snyder's genius comes in. He followed the graphic novel almost exactly. This could have been done very badly, but somehow he was able to make the flashbacks go nearly unnoticed, record being 4 in one scene.<br/><br/>The sound effects were amazing, with a solid track list featuring ""My Chemical Romance."" The blood splatters and bone crushing fist fights were heard quite distinctly, adding some flare to the brutal violence.<br/><br/>Overall, I wouldn't say it completely trumped so of my old favorites in every way, but did give a solid thrill, and raised questions about the potential psychological issues of a hypothetically real superhero.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint, its that Watchmen wasn't made to have a sequel.<br/><br/>10/10- Incredible."
"SocalSam","2","4","8","25 July 2009"," Watchmen: Don't watch
","The graphic novel was awesome. The movie sucked. Like the awful movie ""The Spirit"" this movie was a shock to the system. Using the graphic novel about 98% of the time means you miss an important part of the novelization. Instead of wasting time showing a meat cleaver in a bad guys head, the time could have been better used creating a livable fantasy world. More focus on the love story between the Night Owl and Spectra would have made the movie somewhat more likable.<br/><br/>Having a cadence of: Depressing environment, depressing conversation, depressing murder or mayhem in a movie gets depressing. If you are going to use the graphic novel, then make sure to use the elements of the novel. This means ALL elements, don't leave out the seemingly minor characters that make the novel work. In a movie death is not a transition, it is a period of a sentence. If you use death as a transition, then the normal flow of a movie is broken. This is the case with Watchmen.<br/><br/>If you want to see the movie fine, get it on Netflix. It rivals Batman and Robin for lack of character. In the same way that the Psycho Movie was redone, using Hitchcock's story board and the remake didn't work, neither did Watchmen the movie.<br/><br/>Save your money, buy the graphic novel, which really is a great book."

","Beneath me the city screams out like an abattoir full of retarded children.(This is a narrated line, narrated to nobody, from the actual movie. ""Abattoir"" is an English American word refined from French. The word is most popularly familiar to Americans from The Simpsons. It means ""Slaughterhouse"". More specifically: a public slaughterhouse for sheep. Sheep metaphorically refers to a mob of blind followers. Retarded children are considered by Kirk Cameron to be the easiest possible Christian converts. So a slaughterhouse for sheep, full of sheep cries out. ""Silence of the lambs"", in homage, anyone? Anyway, the way that I have used the line is... well, come to think of it, it's apparently the same way the movie did: I used it to set up the fact that everything that follows that opening line is me pointing at something, explaining why it's retarded and then killing it; which in itself explains, outright and forthwith, why if you like this movie you're probably none-too-bright)<br/><br/>So, check this out, there's an impending NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST and you're capable; and have been given the job of PREVENTING THE DEATH OF EVERY LIVING BEING ON THE PLANET. And you're married. Your spouse has needs, too... but don't worry, you can multiply yourself and have alternate selves, so you can get with the wife AND save the world at the same time. Then, one night, you're DOUBLE TEAMING YOUR OWN WIFE BY YOURSELF while trying to save the planet, and this pisses her off. So she leaves you because you're able to perform a meaningful role at home, at work, and within the world at large without hurting people. That's why women leave their men, because they can care about more than one thing at a time.<br/><br/>Can anybody say BRAINWASHING of clueless-about-women-nerds who ought to breed and maybe produce a better race of humans in the future but instead they're just Gaga over cartoons who could never breed with them or hurt them because the women in comic books, the only women they know, are HOT-AS-HELL but represented as insane and retarded which scares the fanboys from interacting with actual human people about actual human matters?<br/><br/>THINK!!!<br/><br/>I will not deny: the movie has brilliant cinematography, but I liked all of those shots better when Tim Burton and Michael Bay used them in Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, The Rock, etc. The movie also contains ridiculous, overblown music video sequences throughout.<br/><br/>The opening credits, full of live-action representations of those brilliant superhero paintings we all know and love was, I felt, heartwarming. But to do it to ""The Times, They Are A-Changing""? And I mean, the whole darned song. Balloney.<br/><br/>The ease-in from the apartment to the black of Smiley's eye--all the way--was, for lack of a single-word appropriate adjective, too much. The story was very stupid and the characters were all very easily hateable.<br/><br/>This was caprology and scatology: bad story, and smegmatic imagination on level scale with Ed Wood.<br/><br/>BAD MOVIE!!!<br/><br/>It's all right to admit that you made an error in judgment. That you threw away money, that you wish the world was a fantasy world; but that doesn't mean that just because a movie that's based on something you like got a big budget and was made by a slightly competent cinematographer was ever any good to begin with. It's all right to admit that something you like was made poorly.<br/><br/>It is not all right to convince other people to throw away their money on garbage just because you want to pretend it's worth their life to like something you can only pretend you believe in.

"neoraven78","9","4","8","1 April 2009"," Far better than the comic.
","Let me first off state that I am an avid comic book reader and have been since the early 90's. I believe that comics are the greatest entertainment media combining literature and art to create something special. However, I hated Watchmen. It was both dull, drawn out (pun intended), and had poor art. I'm sure it was great in the 80's, but I read it in TPB format in early 2005. The story was compelling but could have been told in 6-8 issues. Now the movie...that's another story. I reluctantly went with my father so that he wouldn't have to go alone and I couldn't believe it. The visuals alone were great but the way they condensed the story created a much more enjoyable experience. If you like dark, anti-heroes and a compelling story, this is the movie for you. I'm glad I went. My guess is that Alan Moore is scared of how good the movie will be. He didn't seem to feel too strongly about The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen which was horrible but he's avoiding Watchmen. He's just an arrogant ass that will miss out on something more than a movie; he'll miss out on a great experience."
"kgprophet","6","4","8","26 March 2009"," The ""Citizen Kane"" of Super Hero movies
","I don't read graphic novels or the like, so my only history with seeing comic book characters are those on the big screen. Superman, Spiderman, Batman, X Men, and so on. Of all the these that I have seen, Watchmen is the ""Citizen Kane"" of super hero movies. Honestly, this movie broke barriers the same way Orson Welles did. Seeing super heroes naked, committing crimes, doing the dirty work for the government, rape, and showing very graphic scenes of gore. On the flipside, this very dense movie lacks the momentum expected in these kind of crackerjack movies. But once again, this is not that kind of movie, and deserves to be in a different category than big budget tent pole films. It deserves accolades for being probably the most expensive niche film ever made. Not everybody will get excited over the story of a retired, very mediocre looking guy reacquainting himself with crime fighting. There are long epic passages of storytelling, which I'm sure are gratifying to the fans of the original story. This film is supposed to cause you to think about the complexities about having super abilities and the difficulty of staying true to your morals. If one is prepared to watch this kind of film, especially after more than one viewing, one can truly appreciate what has been achieved here. The downside is, being the first of it's kind, there are probably now going to be other filmmakers who will draw inspiration from this genre busting movie and refine it in films yet to be. Meaning that the new formula will be tinkered with, and no doubt ending up being more popular than this one. The same thing happened with ""Citizen Kane"". Welle's film did not get a warm response upon it's initial release. It was only years later when it got the attention it deserved.<br/><br/>This film, the next film by the director of ""300"", shows a competent hand with a distinct vision. I feel we the audience are not as advanced as he is in presenting us with a new look and feel. There is a state of mind in the film industry that films like ""Watchmen"" are not what people want to see. It will take a movie producer with foresight to see that it is ultimately an appropriate new avenue to explore if one wants to present audiences with something new in the now overcrowded comic book movie genre. ""Watchmen"" certainly fulfills the eye candy quotient, but it's different pace and sentimentality probably will test the patience of younger audiences. So yes, you might as well make the film for adult audiences and make it R-rated. The amount of positive elements that push the envelope will cause subsequent films to have no choice but acknowledge these new aspects to the super hero genre, and we are all the better for it.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" follows a group of people who are troubled human beings first, and super heroes second. The comedian character represents all that is ugly about America, from JFK to Viet Nam. The scientist character similarly represents the abuse of America's military might. No one is truly innocent, and ""Watchmen"" first threads then unravels these problematic positions they take when dealing with the real world. I am giving this film a 7 out of 10, but I might find it worth a better rating over time. Right now, the only reason I don't give it a better rating is my own aversion to the dated period details: Nixon, Eighties music, excessive night-time Noir production design, and mostly the lack of momentum that made ""300"" so exciting to watch."

","I can't believe this movie is rated so high. I'm beginning to question the IMDb ratings system. While the special effects are awesome and the story starts out great, from the middle towards the end, everything just falls apart. I enjoyed Spiderman, The X-men (part one only), Transformers, and Ironman way more than this movie. <br/><br/>It's also a little too long for no reason at all. To anyone that are thinking about taking young kids to see ""watchmen"" please be aware that this movie is full of graphic violence, strong content, and nudity. While none of these things bothered me, it may bother you. While it's OK to watch, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a must see."
"LeonardPine","9","4","8","11 March 2009"," Go watch the Watchmen
","Zach Snyder was never going to please everybody with his adaptation of the dense, labyrinth novel. But he can definitely feel he's done justice to what couldn't have been an easy thing to adapt. Whats surprising is how faithful the film is to the novel, with whole pages seemingly ripped from the book right up there on the screen! From a fans point of view i got a big kick out of seeing my favourite scenes and characters finally come to life on the big screen. One of the most important aspects in the films success is having the right actors for the film. Thankfully Snyder gets this right. Patrick Wilson nails Night Owl 2 perfectly, Billy Crudup brings Dr Manhattan to life in a way thats tortured and moving, Matthew Goode brings the right amount of cool and arrogance to Veidt, becoming especially effective in the third act. Malin Akerman has been underrated for her Silk Spectre 2 performance, but i think she is excellent in probably the hardest part to pull off. Best of all is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorshach. This guy owns the whole film and its electric whenever he's on screen.<br/><br/>The film looks great and the effects are all top notch. Dr Manhattan is a joy to behold the way he is presented in the film. The Mars scenes are stunning and its great that the smiley face on Mars panel from the novel has been reproduced on film. The Owl ship also looks great and its flying scenes are beautifully shot.<br/><br/>The songs used in the film work surprisingly well, from Dylan, Nat King Cole and Hendrix etc, and the score from Tyler Bates is very good.<br/><br/>Snyder wisely ups the action quota from the novel, and its well shot with no confusing editing ( unlike TDK) and its also very violent and bloody.<br/><br/>Watchmen won't be for everyone of course and the film will take 2 or more viewings to sink in, but i think thats a good sign of the films quality and longevity.<br/><br/>I look forward to the extended cut on DVD when it comes out because i think this film will benefit from repeated viewing and will become a huge cult classic in the same way as Blade Runner did. Go watch the Watchmen. : )"
"orjames7","5","4","8","8 March 2009"," Could have been so much better
","To start off with, I have not read the graphic novel. I was expecting a visually stunning, and hopefully interesting film. Well at least it was visually stunning. The story and the action left much to be desired.<br/><br/>In all fairness, it is difficult to adapt any book to the screen. Books, by their nature, contain many intricate details that are nearly impossible to replicate on-screen. In addition, mood and characters thoughts are also difficult to convey in film. But this film even failed at the basics of establishing characters and their relationships with each other. The story had flashbacks showing various snippets of each character, but their impact was more of ""what the heck is this?"" as opposed to an ""Aaah, now I see why he is this way!"" feel.<br/><br/>The movie was disjointed in the first third and little of any relevance is revealed about each character. When the action does pick up, who cares, you are probably asleep by this point.<br/><br/>Another thing the movies misses the point on, is the point of the movie. Throughout the film the audience is constantly reminded that human nature cannot be changed. Humans are driven to do obscene things in the name of power, greed, and money. And while our ""heroes"" are supposed to be immune to these things, they are not. The part that disturbs me about the end, however, is that despite the message that is delivered throughout the film, it is completely flipped on its head as this supposed big event radically changes human nature, AND WE ARE JUST SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT THAT PREMISE EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE PRESENTED THAT THIS IS THE CASE.<br/><br/>I am trying to be vague about the plot elements in case you have not seen the film yet. But the ending is not supported by anything presented during the previous, arduous 3 hours leading up to the end.<br/><br/>BTW, not for the kiddies at all. With a scene of attempted rape, and the multitude of nudity you will want to keep the kids at home for this one. While you are at it, stay at home yourself and watch something a little better, like the ABC movie of the week!"

","If I was Alan Moore, right now, I would feel somewhat like ""The Comedian"". I would be laughing at the great joke that Watchman turned out to be.<br/><br/>Alan Moore was right. There are certain things a comic book or graphic novel can do that film cannot. I'm a film follower first. It is a much more entertaining medium, after all a movie reads for me. And there is a lot a film CAN do that is impossible to recapture in any other art form, such as songwriting, painting, etc. But the story of the Watchmen was never meant to be lifted from its pages to the big screen.<br/><br/>Their are just too many details a comic can preserve in front of you, transfixed long enough to be studied so the smallest detail can become aware. A movie cannot do this.<br/><br/>In a comic, it is accepted to survey several backstories of multiple characters at a time. One cannot be overwhelmed this way, because a READER can stop, flip back a few pages and review the material that they were just being asked to accept. If you are having a hard time keeping up with the parallels between the old and new ""Minutemen"" flip back a couple pages and read it again. If you didn't quite understand Dr. Manhattan's conversation on Mars and its irony concerning time and human matters, you can stop and allow time for insight.<br/><br/>VIEWERS do not have this pleasure. When a viewer is forced to absorb four flashbacks, one on top of the other, the movie's time line degrades and the viewer loses interest.<br/><br/>Again when the comic book series came out was what made the series so revolutionary. It was a time in comic book history where the biggest problem a superhero had was who was robbing Chase Manhattan today. Alan Moore stepped in and gave real lives to his fictional comic book characters. These characters lived and breathed, they drank when they were unhappy, they had sex, they even had bad breath in the morning. They had something no other comic book personalities shared. Flaws.<br/><br/>The world was not ready for a Watchmen movie. The average movie-goer is not yet bored with the same superhero movie paradigm. They still want to see more special effects and wire-fu especially over something as menial as story, right? A comic book reader, or reader in general, has nothing to look forward to but the story and its substance. It is easier to put down a book than walk out of a theater.<br/><br/>But Snyder did his best to appease the average superhero movie senses. There is a lot of bone crunching and neck breaking action. And the entire movie looks great and is directed like it was from somebody on top of their game, because it was. This movie looks, sounds, and watches just fine. It just looks, sounds, and READS better. The fact that Hollywood had to change the ending of the book goes to show the comic never should have made a film debut.<br/><br/>Ironic enough Hollywood fought and fought to keep the rights from going to Alan Moore and his company. After witnessing the crowd's response to the film tonight, I have a feeling Moore is not going to have too much trouble getting the rights now.<br/><br/>What was the icing on this cake of sheer irony is the song that exits the film. Desolation Row is a song hailed to be one of the better Dylan songs of his whole songwriting career. The fact that it was perverted by ""My Chemical Romance"" of all bands, just proves a point I've been trying to make: some things should not be meddled with.<br/><br/>(this was piece is presented raw and not proof read.

Black white forces bouncing off of each other, NEVER mixing of grey as Rorschach says, the mask is his ""face"".<br/><br/>""The Comedian"" is a ""superhero"" ""war hero"" with sadistic tendencies who sets the stage for the film's themes in the beginning, as well as the very end.<br/><br/>He really just fights evil for something to ""fight"", he knows humans will inevitably kill each other off, and chooses to revel in the chaos.<br/><br/>Then there is ""Dr. Manhattan"" a REAL superhuman...An indestructible immortal nuclear force who can do virtually *anything*, manipulate basic physics that were once thought to be written in stone...He is fighting for America, yet the Soviets are not surrendering..The world is proving The Comedian right.Also due to his condition of no longer being a ""normal"" human,due to tragic circumstances, he becomes unmotivated to defend humanity.He no longer sees the value in humans.<br/><br/>The only retired hero who seems to genuinely care about the world, and promises to end all wars is the retired-hero & self-made millionaire Adrian ""Ozymandias"" Veidt...He is also the only retired hero with the most positive public image, selling action figures & other self-endorsing merchandise.<br/><br/>He's a hero we can completely trust & believe in...Or is he? This film is a rather difficult one to review...I've read the graphic novel before watching this film adaptation which is probably the BEST way to enjoy & understand the film and the movie's opening & ending are the perfect interpretations of the book.<br/><br/>In the middle, it meanders a bit and isn't paced too well IMO...However as adaptations go, I can tell the filmmakers truly understood the book & interpreted it accurately save for, as I mentioned earlier, the strong emotional impact the book provokes.<br/><br/>Even if you didn't read the book, this is definitely an enjoyable film, never a dull moment, and you may not look @ the superhero genre the same way again.<br/><br/>6/10"
"it_works_for_me","6","4","8","6 March 2009"," In the Face of the Apocalyse, the Watchmen Fall Short of Saving the Day
","WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH? (HEAVY SPOILER ALERT!)<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed The Watchmen, but I do not feel that it met the caliber of the comic book films from 2008. The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, and The Dark Knight were all extremely better films than The Watchmen.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint with this movie was how campy it became. Early in the movie, during the scenes with The Comedian, I was extremely impressed, but as the movie grew longer I felt that it became less psychological and much more focused on visuals. The costumes took away from the focus on the story and theme and shifted it toward the characters. While the characters as a whole were well developed and unique, some of the characters fell short in my expectations of 21st century comic book film characters.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was with Ozymandias. It wasn't until the last hour of the movie that I was confident Ozymandias was the villain. I also felt that Ozymandias was extremely underdeveloped. What was his motivation? I was under the belief that he was one of the new heroes, taking the place of the 1940's minutemen, but all of a sudden he became the antagonist. How was he capable of making the giant blue nuclear bomb/device that caused so much havoc? What was his relation or symbolism involving ancient Egyptian Gods and ruins? Extremely poor development on the villain of this film was a massive weakness and plot hole.<br/><br/>On the opposite side, Rorshach was spot on for a major character in a comic book based film. His past and present were clear indicators of his motivation. The scene where he tells everyone in prison, ""I am not trapped here with you. You are imprisoned with me!"" had the entire theater standing and applauding (the only point at which this happened during the film).<br/><br/>Overall, I still can't get over how campy this film felt. At times I wished I was watching the Joel Schumacher Batman films, because those movies seemed less ridiculous. This movie was so difficult to understand I started writing notes on my hand. Dr. Manhattan seemed too ambiguous in what he decided to use his God Powers to prevent/change.<br/><br/>Watch this movie, but don't expect anything better than what you've seen in the last year. I would have rather been asleep from 12:00 AM to 3:00 AM than watching this movie."

This year it happens to be one of the most expensive, big budget movies of the year. The Watchmen trailer looked incredible!! Dark, violent, gritty, based on the DC Comic, action packed....the film was an absolute utter bore-fest. There was some very minor positives to the film but it certainly wasn't enough to make me every want to lay eyes on this film again. I should also mention I have never once read the ""award winning"" graphic novel and now I don't think I ever want to. I find it almost mind blowing that there are some fan boys/girls that ""love"" this movie because I simply saw nothing to it period. The best I can say about it that the film is dark, violent and gritty but unfortunately after 20 minutes to a half hour...you just won't care. The action is mixed with far too much sheer boredom and that doesn't bode well given the 2 1/2 hour run time for the film. Watchmen is a giant paint canvas that the film makers and Zack Snyder treat like their own piece of work.<br/><br/>I really like rising character actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan and perhaps an entire film about his anti-hero The Comedian might have made a more impressive solo film but his murder story simply led the crew which were less than impressive. However Morgan is still a great actor and does well making us love him and hate him all at once. I believe the true hero and star of this completely lack luster film is Jackie Earle Haley who plays the twisted psychologically disturbed hero Rorschach and his alter ego. Haley single handedly gives this film ONE redeemable quality and his performance and his hero deserve so much better than what this film offers. I hope Haley goes on to bigger and much better things. Now I will put together nearly the entire cast under one roof because they all equally stink up this ""film."" Matthew Goode is downright terrible as a gay evil villain who turns the entire concept of villains into a joke. Patrick Wilson is annoying, geeky, and a total joke. Carla Gugino has virtually no character depth and is mostly simply there to take her clothes off. Billy Crudup voices and partially plays the mysterious, emotionally void Dr. Manhattan. His character might have an interesting plot but the character itself is lame and very naked throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>Watchmen might be some sort of graphical achievement and might be followed by legions of fans but this film to the layman is lame. Director Zack Snyder was spoiled with the 300 acclaim. Now I think he felt like he had free reign to create this so called piece of art at a fantastic budget. Unfortunately Snyder has turned down any hope at appealing to the mass audience. I don't know how it could possibly appeal to fans of the graphic novel let alone anyone, like me, who had never heard of or seen the graphic novel. This one just plainly stinks and will not be a hit of the year in any way. 3/10"
"sjmailster","2","6","14","27 March 2009"," Only for Watchmen fanatics
","Meaningless. The movie is too long and has no direction. Lots of violence and since there is not much reason to go with it, it becomes gory. <br/><br/>There are several threads that end up nowhere: Ex-superheroes now leading(trying to) normal lives; Different/special people trying to understand relationships and so on. Interestingly, the one thing missing in this group saga is camaraderie - There never really is a 'Team' but only team members. And how the whole thing leads to 'World Peace' (Yeah, no matter how 'different' the movie tries to be, it finally gets to the same point) beats me.<br/><br/>Avoid unless you are a big fan.<br/><br/>PS: If you do want to watch it, look out for the performance of 'Rorschach'. He has some good lines and the actor delivers them superbly. Thats what the 2 stars are for."
"DICK STEEL","8","6","14","4 March 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Watchmen
","It begins with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a superhero once engaged by the government for its missions, and one of two which is sanctioned by the government. As part of the Minutemen, and then later the Watchmen group, we learn of The Comedian's backstory through a series of flashbacks with the members of his team, and we learn he isn't exactly the usual friendly neighbourhood type nor Mr Popular. He comes complete with plenty of skeletons in the closet, and with an extremely damaged persona made worse from the ghosts of war. He continues to do what he does because he can, which will make any human rights activist seethe with rage.<br/><br/>Investigating the murder because he is certain that it leads to a bigger conspiracy of a hired killer engaged to bump off ex-superheroes, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) takes it upon himself to work outside the system as an outlawed masked vigilante, and this narrative arc runs like an old-fashioned detective crime noir. Running around warning his ex-team members, we soon get introduced to all the other characters, like Dan Dreiberg the Night Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Adrian Veidt's Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), touted as one of the greatest brains and now turned into a successful businessman, who's in pursuit of renewable energy which he deems will turn back the doomsday clock because of his belief that man goes to war over finite resources, Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) whose mother was part of the Minutemen with The Comedian, and the only super-powered being Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup), whose allegiance with the USA staves off any potential pre-emptive aggression by the USSR. Quite a list of actors here and it's a smart move in casting a relatively none-too- A-list cast so that none would chew up the screen at the expense of another character or the plot. <br/><br/>Snyder knows how to play up his strengths, since the movie's intelligence gets handed to him on a silver platter. What was once deem ""unfilmmable"" by directors who entered and left the project like through revolving doors, it's no surprise that the studios had turned to the man who faithfully adapted in visual terms, Frank Miller's graphic novel 300. I suppose it's a bit of a no-brainer here to again try and visually adapt a graphic novel, and an Alan Moore masterpiece at that, by sticking true to its form from the comic panels. This of course would garner Snyder plenty of flak for doing what he does best again, leaving some unimpressed by reasoning it doesn't take a genius to do just that, but seriously, who has the balls to stamp their own mark on the story and characters, other than to put in some minor tweaks for the modern audience? However Snyders shortcomings come in the form of the lengthy narratives found in the graphic novel, especially toward the second half of the film, and that between Dr Manhattan and Silk Spectre II, which he failed in bringing out the dramatic qualities in character realization and affirmation, and the only response to being like a deer caught in the headlights, Is to throw in more CG unfortunately.<br/><br/>Action wise, the film medium allows for Snyder to connect the dots and interpret what happens between comic book panels. Granted the action sequences are few and far between, but Watchmen is never about superheroes busting balls. But when they do, it's no holds barred, and although the trailer seem to suggest plenty of slow-motion, the actual film is anything but. Some of the best set action pieces involve both Night Owl II and Silk Spectre II when they team up to reminisce the days of old. The action sequences here are well filmed, without those quick cut edits or too close a quarter that everything mixes together in a dizzy spin and you can't see anything. In a cinema hall with great sound system, you get to feel every whack and punch the character throws, with the bass reverberating right through to your heart.<br/><br/>Now for the gripes. Unless you're really paying attention and can lip read, some of the dialogue may just fly past you so quickly, that you'll go ""huh?"". And that lengthy chit-chat that Dr. Manhattan has with the Silk Spectre II would test your patience a little, despite some graphical effects being overdone in attempting to distract you for a bit from the bore. I suppose that's one of the difficulties faced, in trying to summarize lengthy text from the book into a visual medium - how do you do so without putting your audience to sleep, and yet crucial enough to have to be included somehow? I guess Snyder had yet to find that perfect balance there. Also, while it was a careful selection of songs from the 80s era for the soundtrack, Snyder shows he's no Tarantino in having a ear for great music, and some of the tunes did feel a little out of place. I did like the insertion of Simon and Garfunkel's Sounds of Silence though during a funeral scene. It worked perfectly and gave a very surreal feel to it all.<br/><br/>Watch the Watchmen if you'd like a quick peek and introduction to the complexity and sheer genius of an Alan Moore story, coupled with visuals that pop right out of the graphic novel. With a little tweaks made to the story, purists may cry foul at such a blasphemous attempt. But if you take a look at the bigger picture, and the sacrifices for the objectives that can be achieved (just like how it plays out in the story) it just might win new fans over, and to pick up the source graphic novel. To that, I'd say this comes in recommended, though no thanks to additional edits made in order to cater to the teenage crowd here whom I suspect would be restless if approaching this film equating Snyder to 300."

","Our 19 year old son persuaded us to go to this movie. My husband & I found it disgusting for a multitude of reasons.<br/><br/>I have walked out on a couple of movies in the past, and they were WONDERFUL by comparison, but I was trying to hang with it for our son. Perhaps it was his birthday. I don't remember. My husband also was doing his best to be patient. <br/><br/>About halfway through, our son looked at us and raised his eyebrows, expressing his desire to leave. He was disgusted also. He was not just leaving out of consideration for us. He truly hated this over the top display of gratuitous stupidity.<br/><br/>It was offensive or lacking on so many levels, artistically and morally. It was the most ""over the top"" & boundary pushing debacle of a movie I've ever seen. To make it worse, it was marketed to kids & teens.<br/><br/>I would be more specific, but we saw it on its opening night and the details are fuzzy in my memory, but not the sense of being deluged with sewage & fetid ignorance. Even Idiocracy far exceeds this film in merit."

","What if ""apocalypse now"" had no background story? What if you have had to read ""heart of darkness"" before fully understanding the madness? What would people have said? Orson Welles could not make the movie, and others have tried... Luckily Coppola was a genius who could make the movie! But what if someone preceded him? That is exactly what has happened here. A great novel, very complex, and a challenge to make into a movie. But instead of waiting on the genius that may not be born yet, we let the guy -who thinks shouting the name of the country (sparta, of course) is the best one liner ever- make the movie. So it is ruined. Please don't say 300 was a good movie because it had good action scenes. This one does to, but that is just not hard with such a budget... So Watchmen has gone from a great novel, to a very mediocre movie. and that is sad..."

","One of the worst movies I have ever seen, I think you have to of read some sort of comic book or novel too like this. We went to Hoyts in Sydney on the opening day and for some reason the cinema was half empty but by the end it was about nine tenths empty because everyone had just walked out it was that bad. The Plot was one of the worst ever constructed, it flipped around back and forth without making any sense until the last 10 minutes (shake spear is almost easier to understand). All the Characters were unlikeable and unrelatble to. You did not feel symphony for any of them. The acting felt pretty bad, probably because of the terrible script. <br/><br/>I have never walked out of a cinema from disgrace before but I was so close of walking out of this one and wish I had of. This is not even worth hiring it is that bad. The only good thing in this movie was the special effects but every thing else was downright awful and painful. I am usually very generous with my rating and am able to usually pick out one reason why a movie should not get 1, but there is no reason for watching this. <br/><br/>(10 perfect, 5 not really worth my time, 1 I would rather watch grass grow for 10 hours than watch this movie for 10 minutes)."

"MovieFanGuyy","1","5","11","14 July 2009"," I'm not a fan of comic book movies, and Watchmen is another reason why.
","Watchmen, which was released earlier this year by Warner Brothers was both a critical and financial disappointment. I understand completely why now. The storyline, which takes place in an ""alternate universe"" demonstrates how a group of costumed vigilantes must struggle with themselves to see whether or not humanity is worth saving from nuclear war. The characters are flawed in this film. Nite Owl, suffers from impotence, Silk Spectre, comes from a troubled childhood. Dr. Manhattan, a glowing blue nightmare who walks around fully nude, contemplates the value of human life. Rorshach, is a psychopath who walks the streets braking people's bones and dispensing his own form of justice. Oxymandias, feels that humanity must be saved by destroying it, and The Comedian is a full blown idiot, who serves his own agenda.<br/><br/>Many audiences who in years past have enjoyed many critically acclaimed box office comic book hits were severely disappointed with this film and I can understand why. First of all, much of the music is highly questionable, and some of the scenes such as Nite Owl and Silk Spectre getting it on inside of his owl shaped spaceship elicits unintentional laughter from the audience. Second is the unnecessary graphic violence. There is absolutely no reason to show a prisoner getting his arm's sawed off in a jailbreak whatsoever, other than to shock the audience for cheap laughs.<br/><br/>Plus, the storyline goes off in a thousand different directions, with one storyline choosing a philosophical point of view, the next choosing a violent point of view, and the third storyline choosing a humorous point of view. I'm sorry but with a film going in so many different directions it's hard to maintain interest in the storyline, or many of the seriously deranged characters here. All in all this feels like the dysfunctional family syndrome of comic book movies. I was highly disappointed, and I feel this is one of the weakest comic book movies ever adapted for the big screen.<br/><br/>One and a half stars out of four. One of the worst comic book movie ever made."
"PinoX7","1","5","11","4 July 2009"," Disgustingly horrible
","I never read the comic book or whatever this came from, but that never stopped me from enjoying other films. I even somewhat enjoyed ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", a movie many people did not like for its terrible plot line, But this film was SO bad, For the first time in my life I feel so depressed that I actually do not want to peruse MANY of the goals that I worked myself up to accomplishing. That girl that I was on the fence about working up enough courage to ask out, not happening, she would probably like this film.<br/><br/>That blue dude was about the farthest thing from intelligence. In his world, he would have no trouble boiling kitties alive, because ""well they are practically insignificant life-forms"" His character was so offensive to anyone with a freaking brain on their shoulders. Even most kids know that you don't throw rocks at kids you don't like, and if they do its clearly because they are not knowledgeable enough to understand, SUFFERING HAS VALUE, even if it is not yours. IF there is suffering in the universe somewhere, it has VALUE.... How does some 'all knowing dude' not even have the brains to see that, was the writer going for total irony here?"

","Let's get this out of the way now - Watchmen the movie is better than the graphic novel. And I know I'm going to be slated for daring to say it. But in my defence I have to add I first read the graphic novel twenty years ago and have been a very big fan ever since.<br/><br/>The characterisation was absolutely spot on for all the major players and a great deal of attention went into capturing the essence of each and even surpassing this in some cases. One of those cases being the greatest character of them all: Rorschach. Jackie Earle Haley was absolutely superb in the role and utterly convinced as the flawed anti-hero whose every action was a the worn like a bloody heart on his sleeve. Billy Crudrup was perfect as the understated big blue giant, Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre was just as I imagined her from the page, even down to the perfect look, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian did a fantastic job showing us the depth of possibly the deepest character in the whole film and almost pulled off some pity for the man too. Add to all of this excellent cinematography, pace, direction and not forgetting the soundtrack you have a film I cannot fault."
"mexicospidergreen","9","5","11","11 April 2009"," Snyder has yet to disappoint us
","With tickets sold out the week before it opened, Zack Snyder's visually stunning masterpiece has finally hit the big screen. This movie fought cruel lawsuits (by the Fox A-Holes), release date changes but it still managed to make it's way out of the cutting room floor. It has also already sold more tickets than 300 (which Snyder also directed.) This is based on the comic book created a few years back, which some of you might not have heard of. Now, I'm here with a full page review of it. This takes place in 1985, and the government has no other ideas than to hire a secret organization of superheroes to keep the world under peace. When one of the members is murdered, the others are on a race to find out why, and save themselves before they are all killed. This is a complex, but visually stunning and original superhero tale. I really liked how Snyder designed his own vision of what the 70's looked like, and how he makes all the CGI look real like. You've got to hand it to him, after the hugely successful 300; this will go down as one of his best works as well. However, even if this is a comic book masterpiece it is absolutely not a movie for kids or even the faint of heart. All the themes in this movie are mature, and it's meant for an adult audience. Snyder mentioned in a column for Entertainment weekly ""I wanted to make sure everyone understood: This is not a kid movie. Violence has consequences,"" and true to his words, there's a large amount of earth shattering and realistic violence in this movie. You can count on seeing a man's arm being ripped off, a man's face being burned by hot oil, and plenty more. Like the comic book, the movie has a lot of mature materiel such as government, vigilante, corruption, poverty, and plenty of other themes you wouldn't expect a 13 year to understand. Not to mention there's a lot of mature content and a rape scene where I closed my eyes on. Actor Jeffery Dean Morgan (Grey's Anatomy) also mentioned that some of the scenes in this movie disturbed him, especially the original ending for this. The original ending was edited due to its graphic nature and how disturbing it was to some audience members. I mentioned at my school the other day if I see any kid under my age going or sneaking in to see this, I am going to kindly go out, tell the ticket manager, and pay for their way into another movie. In fact the UK has this rated at M18, which means no one under that age can get in even with a parent. I was only able to get in because I had my ID on me which clearly stated that I'm 18 (which I am.) I went to see this because I read the comic book (even if I didn't understand some of it), I both stunned visually, and plot wise by it. As for the movie, it followed the comic book, and it does a wonderful job of doing so. However the comic also contained some of the content mentioned here so I wasn't surprised by all the violence in the movie, but found it shocking. This is a visually brilliant and impressive movie, but it's not for kids. Instead rent them Iron Man which is a movie for them. work, us fans of the comic book appreciate what you're doing and, for anyone looking for a film that's 100% faithful to the graphic novel or is looking into being blown away visually, this one's for you."
"Fenix82","10","5","11","10 April 2009"," The first superhero movie that goes beyond
","I have to admit I did not know anything about watchmen before I saw this movie. Never read the comics or saw the animated version. I expected just another superhero movie, something like X-Men, Spiderman or hopefully like Ironman.<br/><br/>Let's get this straight. Watchmen is nothing like the movies mentioned before. It's way more than that. Finally a superhero movie that has to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and never implausible. Characters are great and very well developed. Mainly by flashbacks. The acting is decent. Especially Billy Crudup (Dr. Manhatten), Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian) act over the top. Some dialog has to be considered just brilliant. E.g. ""I would only agree that a symbolic clock is as nourishing to the intellect as a photograph of oxygen to a drowning man."" (Manhatten) or ""None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You are locked in here with me!"" (Rorschach)<br/><br/>For the technical aspects of the movie: The editing is good and the special effects are well done and used properly. Some scenes are just beautiful, for example the kissing scene in front of the atomic explosion.<br/><br/>The song selection surprised me too. 99 Luftballons, The Sound Of Silence or Hallelujah are interesting choices but fit in so well. Last but not least, Philip Glass's Pruit Igoe made Jon Osterman's accident scene even more intense.<br/><br/>Overall I'd give this movie a 9,5 of 10. I voted it a 10 because I hope it's going make it to the Top 250.<br/><br/>Kudos to Zack Snyder. Great job, well done."
"gigan-92","10","5","11","9 April 2009"," The Best Film of 2009 So Far!!!
","Tonight I witnessed one of the greatest movies of all time, putting Zack Synder on my Top Ten Director's List. Where could I possibly start? One thing I should mention that it will be a 3-hour sit during this one, but it's worth it because of all the intricate story telling that is both emotional and clever.<br/><br/>Getting away from that, this movie is incredible, matching up to the ""Dark Knight"" in my opinion. The story is incredibly dark and these characters are, if anything, as realistic as superheroes will ever get. Vigilantes and drunkees, set in a real world with common day problems. Unlike other heroes like Spider-Man who is absent during controversial problems, these anti-heroes have to deal with the horrors of war, violent riots and even attempted rape from other heroes apparently. Especially with the best of them all in my opinion, Rorschach, who discovers there is an ugly side to life and deals with it the way a real hero should; simply killing a child murderer right on the spot. It's a dark justice that we see in this film and that's why I like this character so much. When he died it was a moment of tragedy, the best of them all killed because of his stand for the truth. There is no sugar-coating of the real world in this film, as simple as that. Another great character is the Comedian. Jeffery Dean Morgan portrayed the character perfectly as a dark representation of America itself in my opinion. No matter how much you hate him, the anti-hero represents life's demons so to speak. The action is kick-ass and the visuals are even better. Dr. Manhattan himself is a reason to love the film and the 'love-triangle' is great. The atmosphere created by the dark story makes you fear for and actually embrace the characters, as I have. The score is beautiful and Tyler Bates delivers. The ending will leave you stunned to say the least and the dialogue is just as memorable as ""The Dark Knight"" if I do say so myself. Synder did an excellent job bringing these characters to life and I will definitely see this film again. Having read the graphic novel, I can say it's a more than faithful adaption as well and the real way to experience it is the director's cut."
"jfish222","9","5","11","7 April 2009"," Remarkable - The first comic adaptation I've see worth its ticket price and then some
","So much has already been posted here, that I will refrain from rehashing the critiques of others. Instead I will simply leave the reader with a single observation that lead me to leave what I consider to be a high score. I will however say that I have not read the comic, and have no doubt that the comic is superior (I've never heard of an adaptation trumping the original).<br/><br/>I have seen comparisons to the Dark Knight, but frankly I was not impressed with D.K. and found its attempt to look into the ""soul"" of humanity to be flashy and superficial. Granted it was one of the best attempts yet for a comic book rehash, but I honestly felt that it fell flat.<br/><br/>Watchmen, on the other hand, had a far fuller view of the spectrum of humanity, and could more be compared to the first Matrix in its transcendental views. Though the religious/philosophical undertones were not as explicit as in the first Matrix, the first Matrix used these themes as sugar for an otherwise visceral action flick (I'm speaking about time spent pondering the issues, not the depths at which the movie attempted to explore them). The Watchmen did the opposite. The action was fewer and farther between, and often meant to further the character development and commentary of its themes.<br/><br/>I am saddened to hear that it did not sweep the box office (as its budget demanded, and the film rightfully deserved). This was a rare success in an industry that has otherwise failed to remake the comic genre into films with substance."

","Watchmen {dir. Zack Snyder, 2009} (****/****) <br/><br/>Although it loses some luster upon second viewing, Watchmen remains a top-notch movie. It is strictly loyal to the source, and actually improves upon the ending. (Sorry squid-lovers!) Yes, the sex scene is gratuitous, but I'll give Snyder room to take one false move when the rest of the film is this good. Beautiful to look at and interestingly plotted, Watchmen resembles Kubrick in the way it seems game to go against every rule of the comic book genre. Needless to say, we are a long way away from the mindless antics of Daredevil or Ghost Rider. This blockbuster has a brain to match its brawn."

Don't go in and expect a big time Superman or Spider-Man movie because you will only come out with a big disappointment. This is not your average super hero movie. This is about war and the violence we cause. And it's the Watchmen who tries to bring peace by doing justices.<br/><br/>It all begins with an awesome fight sequences where the Comicdian gets murdered. Rorschach, a mask vigilant, goes on to investigate the murder. Later, more of them starts to get murdered. Silk Spectre goes to look for Nite Owl because she had an ague with Dr. Manhattan who later got blame for spreading cancer and went exile. Soon Silk Spectre starts and Nite Owl starts to love each other and they team up with Rorschach to find out what's happening.<br/><br/>Fans of the comic might be a little disappointed with the film because there are some major changes in the comic and movie. Although even if it doesn't live up to the comic it is still a great Graphic Novel movie to enjoy with some great direction from Zack Snyder and his Slow motion sequences. With the mix of a wonderful soundtrack. And my favorite scene in the whole film is the beginning where the Comicdian gets murdered and they have the song 'Unforgettable' playing in the background.<br/><br/>The Characters are all well portrayed by the cast. They're dark, some of them are so called insane, like Rorschach. The comicdian jut enjoy killing everyone. Great job to Billy Crudup who played Dr. Manhattan. The cast are all well picked to portray the roles. Patrick Wilson does look like Dan Dreiberg or Nite Owl.<br/><br/>This is a film fans of the comic would enjoy. And after all those legal issue, is this worth the wait? I would say Yes. This is worth the wait. This is worth the watch. This is one most will be re watching over and over again.<br/><br/>Overall 4/5 Stars"

","I'm a fan of the Graphic Novel (comic) that this is based on and to be honest, I wasn't disappointed with the movie. I was really happy how it turned out, the best way to explain this though, is by talking about how the film was actually made.<br/><br/>After many failed attempts to make this movie by Terry Gilliam and Darren Aronofsky. It was finally given to Zack Snyder to make. What a lot of the fanboys of the book don't realise about this movie, is that when Snyder was first attached, the script had been dumbed down to PG-13. So all the people who didn't like Snyder's directing of it and the amount of effort he put into it should probably have a good long think about what that would mean and go watch the Incredibles.<br/><br/>Now we've got an alternate world to our own here, Richard Nixon is in his third term and America has won the Vietnam war. The story kicks off with a typical Snyder fight scene. Lots of slow-motion and big hits. After the Comedian dies, the credits role, and manage to tell the viewer a whole lot more about the world we are in. Shows the rise and fall of the masked vigilante, the arrival of Dr. Manhattan and the world on the brink of nuclear war.<br/><br/>The story jumps back and forward through time to show how the characters came to be how they are, including the Comedian shooting a pregnant lady (PG-13?), Rorshach cleaving someones head in two with a meat cleaver (PG-13?) and Dr. Manhattan walking around with a blue dick. A lot of people complain about seeing it, but I think its time for people to get over it and it is good point at showing how faithful to the book Snyder was. Some of the most important scenes would have been nowhere to be seen if it weren't for Snyder and the success of 300.<br/><br/>There are only a few criticisms I have of the movie. The use of Hallelujah for the sex scene for one, awful song selection. A few of the fight scenes glorified them as super-heroes when the story was them not being superheros. The last few scenes seemed a bit rushed as well.<br/><br/>I'll definitely buy this one on DVD, I look forward to seeing the directors cut which includes Tales of the Black Freighter (a part of the story to be released on DVD seperatly from the movie).<br/><br/>In the end the movie was a good look at all what life would be like for past their prime superheroes. How it has effected their lives. It was an interesting story that would not have been the same had Snyder not been attached. I'd like to thank have for making it so damn faithful.<br/><br/>8/10 P.S. all the fanboys should think about how much more Snyder seems to care about this story than them. The amount of fighting he did for this movie is admirable and I probably would not have seen it if it was PG-13. He kept in the more important stuff and kept Watchmen feeling like I was watching the Watchmen the whole time."
"preppy-3","10","5","11","25 March 2009"," An exhausting movie but fascinating
","This is an adaptation of Alan Moore's great graphic novel. It takes place in an alternate universe in the 1980s when Richard Nixon is still president. Super hero groups have been outlawed by the president. The former Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is savagely killed. Another hero named Rorschah (Jackie Earle Haley) investigates and notices former super heroes AND villains are being killed. Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) and Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman) also know something is up. And the blue (and frequently nude) Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) sees something apocalyptic approaching...<br/><br/>If you haven't read the novel you might have a problem with this. There's WAY too much happening in the book to cram into one movie so this moves through characters and situations at light speed. Some subplots are dropped completely and the depressing tone of the book is lightened. There's also some pretty funny lines added to lighten things up. My favorites came when the main villain says, ""I'm not some comic book super villain"" and someone says (when it's mentioned Ronald Reagan might be running for president), ""Nobody wants a cowboy as a president"". Even with the changes this might confuse people who haven't read the book. I've read it multiple times so I wasn't confused. I went with a friend who never read it and she wasn't confused either! I guess it just depends on the person.<br/><br/>The movie is 165 minutes--it's long but I was never bored. The visuals are impressive and the special effects are just great. I was exhausted and depressed by the end of the movie but I love it. It's that rarity--an adult film not dumbed down for teenagers. Yes, it involves super heroes in silly costumes (Nite Owl II in particular) but the fights aren't fun. They're violent, VERY bloody and brutal...especially when the Comedian gets involved. He enjoys the violence and the film shows him going full blast. There's also a rape scene which is actually more upsetting than the bloody battles! The only fight sequence that wasn't too bloody or upsetting was when Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II invade a prison and basically knock down about 30 or 40 prisoners in a few minutes! Fights aside this is also a mystery about what's going on and why. It's well-done and keeps you guessing till the end. Then there's nudity--there's plenty of nude full-frontal shots of Dr. Manhattan. But seriously--what's the problem? It's a penis. So what? Every guy has one! Supposedly this has upset people but the movie IS R rated and it fits the character. When I saw it my audience was dead quiet. Nobody seemed bothered or unnerved by it. If you're so prudish that a nude guy bothers you then perhaps you shouldn't see the movie. Great soundtrack too.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Morgan has the hardest role but he pulls it off. Wilson and Ackerman are sympathetic and nice without becoming TOO syrupy. As for Crudup I can't say how good he is. It's his voice but Manhattan is all CGI. All I'll say is that his voice matches the character. Haley is good too but his voice was way too caustic for the character. Carla Gugino also shines in a supporting role. Only Matthew Goode (as Ozymandies) disappoints. He seems to be holding back for some reason...but he's not in the movie much.<br/><br/>So a very violent, long and adult super hero movie. It's not for everybody but I was fascinated. A 10 all the way."
"JasonK78","9","5","11","11 March 2009"," Watchmen is a powerful and deeply intellectual film.
","""Who watches the Watchmen?"" More importantly, who are the Watchmen? Never before has a comic book movie reached this kind of hype featuring characters only revered by its hardcore fan base. The formula for a blockbuster superhero movie is usually concocted with well-known actors playing iconic characters that surpass through different cultural barriers and jolt their popularity beyond the borders of ink and paper from their perspective comic books. With Watchmen, the producers and director are banking on the compelling and intense story from what many consider to be the greatest graphic novel of all time.<br/><br/>It's 1985, but not the 1985 most of us love and remember. Watchmen's 1985 looks like a result of Biff stealing Doc Brown's Delorean time machine, only a hundred times worse. The cold war is stronger than ever between the USA and USSR. President Richard Nixon is on his 5th term. And superheroes have been outlawed. The only deterrent to thermonuclear war is a former Watchman who goes by the name Dr. Manhattan. Due to an accident during a physics experiment, Dr. Jon Osterman is now a being of pure energy, capable of manipulating matter to his will. However as both the US and Soviet's stockpile of weapons grows, faith wanes even in Dr. Manhattan's ability to save the world.<br/><br/>Although superheroes have been outlawed, another former Watchman named Rorschach plays by his own set of rules. He's investigating the murder of one of his former Watchman partners, and what he uncovers will affect the entire world.<br/><br/>Even though many people have never heard of the graphic novel Watchmen, which the movie is based on, it does have a strong and loyal fan base. Unlike films such as The Dark Knight, Superman, and Iron Man, the general public has little to no identity with the Watchmen heroes. The excitement and anticipation levels to see a familiar character come to life are strongly diminished due to the fact that this film is the first time a large percentage of the audience will be exposed to them. Fortunately for Watchmen, it does not rely on the nostalgia of Saturday morning cartoons, lunchboxes, toys or video games. Watchmen's source material is more than enough to elevate it to one of the greatest comic book movies ever made.<br/><br/>The Watchmen comic book is more commonly referred to as a graphic novel. The film takes the word ""graphic"" very seriously. The characters may still be running around in costumes, but for most of them, that's where the similarities with the more revered superheroes end. This skewed reality of 1985 does not have any room for sympathetic heroes. Enter Rorschach.<br/><br/>Watchmen does a phenomenal job giving depth and development to a large cast of characters, but if you had to pick one to be the center of the story, Rorschach would be it. If it were fictionally possible, Rorschach would be the illegitimate love child of Batman and Danny Bonaduce. And for those of you who are fans of the website IMDb, you'll be in for a shock to see that the actor playing this role, Jackie Earle Haley, is no stranger to playing a ""bad ass"" even when he was twelve years old.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder, (300), definitely puts his stamp on the film with his intense ""bullet time"" action sequences, and at the same time keeps everything moving at a steady pace so as not to lose the depth of the characters. Far too often with comic book films, the audience is just waiting until the next scene where the hero once again dons his costume. Snyder does a great job keeping all of the non-conflict and background content just as compelling as the high-energy, costume-clad scenes. A prime example of Snyder's detailed storytelling abilities is culminated in one of the most entertaining and useful opening credit sequences in movie history. Not to mention, the film's transitional scenes are paired up with an unorthodox, yet custom fitted soundtrack.<br/><br/>The most notable difference between Watchmen and its past competition is that it just feels ""bigger"" than most other comic book films. Not because more money was spent or the special effects were better, but because the threat the heroes are trying to prevent was at one time, very, very real. This film doesn't take place in a fictional city like Gotham or Metropolis. The story of these heroes transcend through multiple countries and decades of world history, all in a faux reality that walks a thin line between fantastic imagination and our worst fears."
"craig_c24","3","5","11","9 March 2009"," Yawn
","An embarrassingly poor attempt at translating the Watchmen graphic novel to screen. To sum it up in a few words, this film is devoid of structure, is nigh on plot less, at best the narrative is messy, its far too long and is ridiculously overblown at pretentious. Zack Sneider has taken the source material, transferred it to screen, and left behind any subtext, depth and in fact just about anything of genuine interest. What we have instead is something unfathomably difficult to follow, mainly due to Sneider's horrible scattergun approach to plotting, and also without any real sense of empathy. There are too many characters that are not fully developed, and there is absolutely no reason for anyone to sympathise with them or care about them. In an attempt to imbue characters with a sense of moral ambiguity, we are left to rely on voice overs and shoddy 'flashback' sequences that are lacking in depth and development. Far too often we are forced to rely on characters' words, as Sneider himself appears to lack confidence that the film itself is able to convey anything. He is right to lack of confidence, as Watchmen fails to deliver on just about every level."

The movie didn't make sense the plot was messy basically the movie was all over the place i lost interest in it within the first half hour. It spent ages explaining the generation of watchmen at the start and then spilled into a bad plot with a relatively poor ending this movie had the potential i have to admit to be a great block buster maybe even so like the dark knight... but it didn't! Some people said it was action packed and all there was, was a couple of slow fighting scenes. There was moments where you thought it might pick up but it was just bland right through......."
"artistanbul","5","5","11","7 March 2009"," Confused and trying too hard
","-Minor Spoilers- I just came back from the theater and I'm pretty unhappy. I like watching my movies with low expectations and if I can ignorant about the plot. Both were the case with this movie. At most I expected a good action movie or a CGI fest.<br/><br/>In summary I've said, confused and trying too hard. I felt this throughout the movie. There are movies that make you uneasy, uncomfortable and confused, but in the end it comes together and hits you in the face while pleasing you in an unusual way. This is not that movie. This is just ""what?"" A perfect movie is the one you can't take out anything from, without making it worse. You could take lots of things out of this movie, and it would actually get better. Pointless sex scenes, pointless sidetracks, pointless blue genitalia, pointless and dead end side stories... you name it.<br/><br/>Trying too hard. The movie is trying to break grounds, by breaking some clichés. For example, breaking into a computer by guessing password. The character tries to guess, we think he's gonna get it and get ready to cringe, but he can't. Oooh. Surprise. Well he gets it in the third try. Sex scene where the guy can't get it up, trying to be realistic (why?). Meh OK. But then he proceeds to get the ultimate Hollywood lay. It's like the director said ""let's break new grounds"" without having the need to break them. Just for the heck of it.<br/><br/>OK. Action? Sparse. This is one of the movies with most inner monologue and diegesis. Boring. CGI? Existent. Pretty good. Actors are pretty good overall. especially Jeffrey Dean Morgan.<br/><br/>Watch it with very low expectations and with a lot of time in hand."

It was one of the first comics I read when it came out (I still have the original 12 comics) and as I've grown up with it more over the years I've come to appreciate it more and more. This film isn't a total loss however. The portrayal of the Comedian and Ozymandias are first rate and the feel of the film borrows a lot from 300 which isn't a bad thing, but sadly the bad outweighs the good... Silk Spectre and Dr Manhattan are flat and uninteresting and the pace is so fast that if you blink you miss major plot lines...<br/><br/>Not a total write off but disappointing from a die hard fan of the book"

","I admit i'm not a 'Watchmen' comic fan but if people willing to adapt it as a film then i believe it's must be a good comic in it's way. But this film adaptation is one of the stinky movie i have been watching in a long long long time...<br/><br/>Problem as below: 1)The violent - That's so much violent in the movie from the start, first it feel fresh and raw then it's just get boring, feel like it's doing it for the shock value. 2)No matter how much visual effect you use you can't make a crap movie interesting. Then some part of the movie having the c grade visual effect there, it's just painful to watch... Stop running the comic book please. 3)Why use so much slow motion on the action piece, it's feel slow slow slow. Hit it hard hit it fast, blow me away please... <br/><br/>4)The sex scene is a joke. Yes i can see ass, hot body but the way the director deliver it... it's so so so lame. I don't think even a 15 yrs old boy find it hot. 5)The way the movie unfolding and telling too much detail on the little things just seen too slow and boring for a superhero action film. That's many times leave me wonder and asking the director 'Why you do that for?' or 'Do you have to explain everything in such a detail, what a drag...' Sometimes less is more, this is include the ending of the movie, what a disappointment. In Wikipedia state ""Watchmen is a faithful adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel"" and ""It's the Watchmen film you always wanted to see, but never expected to get"". In this case i'm totally agree because what work on the comic doesn't always necessary work on the film.<br/><br/>6)The music - great choice of music, many great song seriously but i guess i'm watching a movie not some soft of MTV video clip right. The music suppose helping to tell the story not overtaking the moment in the movie. Like if you don't like the movie at least you can buy the soundtrack... shame shame shame. 7)Great trailer but please don't fool by the trailer, because the trailer is at least 100 times better than the movie.<br/><br/>Now i wanna try to read the comic book and for the movie - what a waste of time (2hours and 40mins) and money, even you get to see how they push the button by showing a blue penis in many moment in the film, it's still not worth for you money and time. Mutton dress as lamb. Just because the title of the movie is 'Watchmen' doesn't mean it's gonna be half as good as the comic. Is this another comic book story victim under the shiny Hollywood money making machine? <br/><br/>This is my top three worst movie of all time with such a disappointment, especially with that kind of budget they got (us$100 million). And the first time ever i did boo in the cinema after the movie. No offense to anybody..."

","We live in an era there the superhero genre is big, and since Iron Man (2008) begun the Marvel Cinematic Universe, superheroes have been seen on the big screen more than ever. Marvel and DC are the rivals who dominates the cinematic world, but Watchmen is neither Marvel nor DC.
Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons and John Higgins, the movie adapts the story close to the original source and have a great cast. Especially Jackie Earle Haley as the dark and brooding Rorschach steals the show, the man is born to play dark and intimidating characters.<br/><br/>What I like very much about Watchmen is the unconventional and dark tone. What if superheroes existed in real life, who would they be and would they be so sympathetic and likeable? The Comedian is seen as a hero, but he is a really bad human being and more like a villain. Ozymandias is considered a villain, but feels in some aspects more of a hero than The Comedian.<br/><br/>Some people say Watchmen isn't really a superhero movie, it is more like a mystery and crime drama which happens to have superheroes in it.

","This is Zack Snyder's best film, which is either saying a lot or very little considering that I hold none of his movies in high esteem. The first 45 minutes of this film are fantastic. Probably the best filmmaking Snyder will ever do in his career. It had me intrigued from its first scene to its excellent opening credit sequence to about the part where Doctor Manhatten fakes sex with silk specter (did he?) by using copies of himself. After that ridiculous scene, the film started to drip with cheese and couldn't seem to take itself seriously anymore even while dealing with serious themes. It would have been fine - if the film was adept at dark comedy, but Snyder seems to be inept when it comes to that type of subtle filmmaking. In fact, Snyder never really seems to tap into his characters, or tell a good story. He is all about the heavy themes, but the themes he presents would have hit harder without him hammering them in. Snyder is far too on the nose for this film to resonate. Also, why do none of Snyder's films have any semblance of character development? It's like he is playing with action figures but can't figure out anything meaningful for them to say before they throw down. A mediocre film that could have been a great film if Snyder added more nuance to his vision. Hell, maybe this film will be seen as a masterpiece in twenty years time when people are given a new perspective that I have yet to see out of. The movie had lots of potential, but got lost in its ambitions. 6 out of 10 for what could have been..."
"DanielRobertRoss","5","2","3","17 May 2016"," Better than I remember
","Like most people, I had mixed feelings towards Zack Snyder's Watchmen when I saw it in cinemas back in 2009. But after watching it the other day on Netflix, I have come to re appreciate the film.<br/><br/>The graphic novel is one of the all time greats. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' book took the art to a whole new level, and Zack Snyder, hot after the success of the brawny machismo and violence of 300, seemed like the perfect man to do another slavishly loyal film adaptation. But he was criticized for being too loyal to the source material, and not allowing scenes to breath and take on a life of their own, and while there is some truth to this, I find the positives in the film far outweigh the negatives.<br/><br/>The opening credits montage is rightly lauded as one of the best opening scenes ever. Jackie Earle Haley is brilliant as Rorschach, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian captures the spirit of the character perfectly. The rest of the cast is unfortunately hit and miss. And the running time is still an issue. There are scenes that could have easily been left on the cutting room floor, and other moments from the graphic novel that would have made the film easier to follow for newcomers, but for whatever reason, were jettisoned. And the sex scene in the owl ship? Bleaurgh. <br/><br/>Final thoughts are that I'm glad it was made. It's probably the best version of the story possible, but some diversions from the narrative would've made it more fun. Recently there have been talks about making a TV series based on the graphic novel, and that would probably service such a dense and multi-layered story better. But I give Snyder kudos for tackling a very noncommercial film about serious issues, with no famous actors, a three hour running time and a glowing blue naked man."

","Meh, is pretty much what I can say about this. I finally sat down and watched this. I had only read the graphic novel a few years before at the beckon of comic obsessed friends of mine but found myself really enjoying it.<br/><br/>This movie was a direct and literal conversion with a C+ cast, because you really can't call this an ""interpretation"" of the book as it was a graphic novel. So it wasn't really up to anyone to ""turn it into a film"", merely animate the pages, so as far as that goes: Mission accomplished. However, the pacing, casting, music and cinematography are the elements that the film version had carte blanche to work with so that's what in the end defines my verdict and all I have to say is: Meh.<br/><br/>The Pacing was too slow making the film overly long, the music was adequate as was the cinematography/CGI and the cast was a mix of B and C actors, so the result was some hit or miss dramatic cues and a very clunky and robotic feel to the whole thing. It's hard to not seem biased as a fan of the book and the way it happened in my mind while reading look at it the novel, but it just seemed like everyone was just sort playing the part as a, to borrow some lore, Vulcan would, logical straight to the point and zero deviation, which at the pace chosen would have come as a welcome surprise no matter how minute.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a more film noir ""Sin City"" sort of take on the pacing and cinematography to the bare minimum we got to just essentially animate the pages.

The story is full of such moments where you think ""but if he has such powers, then why doesn't he do this or that...""; or ""yeah sure, if that were true then...""; ...<br/><br/>I tended to appreciate the naturalistic way of showing the different personalities, but also here they don't make sense... all together there's no logic in it.<br/><br/>And finally, I think there's probably too much content that the director tried to put into one movie. Even he made it a long movie it still is overloaded with content (why was it so necessary to tell the whole love- story of Dr Manhattan and so...?). I feel I've wasted 162 min of my valuable weekend. The only thing it taught me is about some comic characters that I had only heard of before, like Rorschach for ex.<br/><br/>Unless you are a comic fanatic with lots of free time, then I don't advice you to waste your time watching this movie. Point."
"Tom6253","5","2","3","12 December 2009"," The Watchmen: For fans only!
","Zach Snyder's latest visionary epic is very impressive, yet ridiculous. It has a lot of elements about it that I loved, and I thought were very memorable and entertaining; There were just things about the movie through its seriousness that were either laughable, questionable, or just stupid.<br/><br/>First, on the positive side, this film is not without its redeemable qualities. For instance, the performances wielded by the cast were very admirable. Especially Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of Rorschach. On a side note: It's nice to see such a familiar face reemerge from the seventies golden-age of cinema, and begin making appearances in mainstream film once again. Haley, if you remember was in the Bad News Bears films and Breaking Away. He was a teen idol from the seventies. Another great aspect was the graphic violence of the film. Scenes of devastation, mutilation, and impressive choreography were very intense and pleasing to the entertainment value. And the story, though complicated and, at times, hard to pick up on, carried with it several surprises.<br/><br/>As far as what weakens the film, I found it to be extremely comical in parts, and also questionable as to certain elements. For one thing, seeing people as costumed heroes interacting in a human drama made it hard for me to take it seriously. That of course is just my opinion and very much debatable from person to person. But that Jon character walking around in a speedo for half the film and with his dingaling hanging out for the other half, I just couldn't take it seriously. Not just his appearance, but the other costumed vigilantes as well. There costumes were almost goofy. Then there is the questionable aspects. If they can be killed by a mere bullet, what was to stop them from being killed already. They call them superheroes, but they weren't too super to me.<br/><br/>I say for fans only, because I think most casual viewers would not appreciate it for what it is. I think unless you are a fan of comic books, you might have a hard time getting past the same things I did. But that is also what I admired about the film. You can literally tell that this is a movie for the comic book fans. It did not compromise itself or its own integrity to suit the masses, so for that, I commend Zach Snyder for the direction, and for the Warner and Paramount hierarchy for staying out of the way."
"sue_popkes","1","8","21","8 March 2009"," This movie was the worst I have seen since the Titanic
","The choppy story was impossible to follow and there were no characters that we cared about because we never found out enough about them in any sort of meaningful way. Since I haven't seen the comic book, I was at a bit of a disadvantage. Was never so glad to see this extremely LONG movie end. Definitely, NOT worth the money unless you are just a special effect freak. The soundtrack and special effects were excellent. The camera techniques were also excellent, too bad all of that fine work was wasted on a really bad story (or lack thereof). The makeup effects were very good also. Complete re editing might possible improve this movie, but it was so bad, I won't waste my time watching any remake. I was disappointed that a movie this bad was better than an eight on IMDb."
"saru2020","4","1","1","13 April 2020"," Strictly for comic fans, I believe
","This is strictly for comic fans, almost half of the movie shows a side storyline in animated version and there seems to be not much comparison with the actual storyline of the film.
The characterisation of Dr. Manhatten(blue man) is designed in a fantastic way, where he's given almost a god-like power but the group where he's placed isn't right at all. Why does a god-like superhero be in a group with powerless & shameless and only superhero-like dressed crappy humans? This is a huge flaw in the writing itself and seeing it as a movie is like treating the treating the audience as bloody fools.
The making was well good enough, the screenplay was engaging enough and the twist in the climax was also satisfactory but the it was lengthy as hell, finally it felt like having watched 2-3 movies in parallel.
Except the blue man's characterisation and an extended sex scene, nothing really stays in mind finally."

"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","31 August 2018"," The ingredients of a great movie, baked into an okay one.
","It's a little hard for me to form a solid opinion on this movie. The only thing I'm certain of is that it could have been better, but I'm not exactly sure how. It just feels like a B-level effort was brought to every aspect of the story, resulting in a C-level story. I think what the movie may be lacking is a cohesive theme. Everything else is in place: decent characters, a fairly interesting world, a villainous plan that surpasses most, and obviously the cool directing style of Zach Snyder. It just needed something to tie it all together and give it meaning.<br/><br/>It seems like this would have worked better as either a TV mini-series or with a simplified plot. Much of the dissatisfaction I think comes from spending a disproportionate amount of time with certain characters and plots. We don't see a whole lot of Ozymandius throughout the movie, which makes the reveal of him as the villain less impactful than it might have been. There seemed to be too much time spent with Silk Specter's relationships with Dr. Manhattan and Nite Owl. And all of the time we spent with the characters felt a little misplaced and pointless, particularly in the case of Rosharch. We learn a bit about each one, but what we learn never really becomes important. I would assume that the characters' and their backstories tie into the plot much better in the graphic novel, but it just felt like they were focusing on the wrong things here.<br/><br/>There were a few things that also felt out of place. The fact that Rosharch takes off his mask about two-thirds of the way through felt wrong somehow, like a betrayal of him as a character. The limitations on Dr. Manhattan's abilities were a little too convenient and ended up complicating things unnecessarily. The most glaring issue was that we mostly viewed the story through Silk Specter and Nite Owl's perspectives when they weren't nearly as involved in the major plot of the story as Rosharch, Dr. Manhattan, and Ozymandius were.<br/><br/>I don't like that all of this review is negative, because there are a lot of good things about this movie. But it's hard to talk about them without acknowledging how they fail to have any kind of satisfying payoff. It's easy to see a movie and point out story problems as an outsider, but it's quite another thing to come up with valid ideas for how to fix them. However, this is a rare case where I feel like I could have written a better version of this movie. It wouldn't be a perfect version, and to be fair I haven't read the source material, but I think that I could put this story together in a way that made more dramatic and thematic sense. This is not to suggest that the screenwriters who adapted this did a bad job, they may have pushed for a different version and did an admirable job with what was surely a very difficult adaptation. I just feel like a story with raw elements as good as Watchmen has deserves to get a better treatment than it got. I did like that the movie had the guts to let the villain truly win and destroy any chance for a sequel, but even this ending seems like kind of a cop-out to developing interesting arcs and themes. Overall Rating: 7.3/10."
"organizm11","8","1","1","25 August 2018"," I personally...
","...Get mad at people that just crap on movies like this. It may not be your cup of tea but if you are a fan of darker superhero movies and comics and maybe painting the superhero in a more realistic light then this is one of the few movies that would give you what you're looking for. I'll keep it short. It's a good movie no matter what you're looking for as long as you like super heroes (with the exception of the campiness of Batman '69 then you may not enjoy it). To like super heroes and to dump on this movie at the same time is an oxymoron."

This is a work of beauty that the graphic novel lovers should not dismiss. Very, very, very good.<br/><br/>Footnote for the naysayers: rewatched this again with 110% attention.

","It is clear that the left won the war in Vietnam and the war on drugs so why do they need to be so overly vehement concerning Nixon and the relatively naive 1960's--or are they simply recounting old glories... However you frame it their treatment of the people and of that time can only be classified as a heavy handed piece of Propaganda."
"tarekshabana","8","1","1","29 July 2017"," It Isn't Just The Dark Knight that Transcends the Superhero Genre
","I was surprised at the way Watchmen viewed its superheroes. It makes them seem more human than the usual idealistic superheroes. Even the idealistic, uncompromising superhero, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), isn't your average ""idealistic superhero."" <br/><br/>It's 1985, and superheroes are banned from society by law. However, one veteran superhero, The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), attempts to bring the superheroes back together to fight crime. His intentions become known and he is quickly assassinated. Rorschach, ""uncompromising"" as he is, takes it upon himself to investigate The Comedian's assassination. What's interesting here though is the plot's revelation, which is more concerned with its characters and their actions as they face certain dilemmas rather than the story itself. Through this new display of superheroes we become attached and caring for the characters here more than in most other superhero movies. Each superhero has their own morale, and to a large degree we are able to at least understand, if not relate or agree, their reasoning, and when you have at least 4 superheroes with their ideals presented so well and comprehensively, you know this is brilliant screenplay. <br/><br/>The action sequences are decent, there's nothing superb about them nor anything flawed. The filming and the costumes are notable for giving the movie a comic book feel with its lighting and CGI. While this does compromise the movie's potential by limiting our emotional attachment (we're constantly reminded that they are ""comic book characters"") it does satisfy comic book fans and movie savvies alike. <br/><br/>The character whom I found most fascinating was Dr. Manhattan. Even though he seems godlike and other-worldly, he's more like how a human would be if he became godlike (which is what Dr. Manhattan is). I've always believed that it's pointless to view our world (Earth, or more specifically our social circle, family etc.) from the perspective of ""the grand scheme of things"" because by doing that you undermine the value of everything that means everything to you, you betray relativity and that's what matters to you. But when you're like Dr. Manhattan, the grand scheme of things becomes your relativity, and knowing this makes you very understanding of his view of our world. <br/><br/>Lastly, I'd like to talk about the last scene of the film. Here is where the film does not compromise, here the film does not attempt to please the audience and allows the characters to truly come alive and deal with the circumstances by their moral codes. I believe (and this may be an over analysis) that the ending shows that there is no ultimate ""right and wrong"" but it is those with the power to force their beliefs and ideals on the world who make the right and wrong."
"wogsurfer","10","1","1","27 May 2017"," An experience that I love going back to.
","As humans, we are drawn to what inspires us, interests us, and tickles our fancy. Human opinion can be a fickle thing, especially when it comes to film, books, and music, due to this the message that is interwoven through these mediums are missed by all of us simply because we won't take the time to watch, read or listen to what is being said to us.<br/><br/>The message throughout Watchman and Tales of The Black Freighter in film and more importantly in graphic novel form is that we as humans try so hard to make the world a better place, but being pushed so far while trying to rid the world of evil we become the very thing we're fighting against, sometimes this a fact we do not see, or we do when it's too late. When Alan Moore wrote the story for the graphic novel, he did so at the height of this planet's greatest threat of nuclear annihilation; The Cold War, The U.S. and Russia at a stalemate over nuclear arms, and Russia's invasion of Afghanistan, had meant that at any moment millions of people on this planet could have met a brutal end.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, this is a concept that has been warped, and manipulated into a alternate universe where in 1985 Richard Nixon has changed the constitution of the USA and made it allowable for him to serve more than 2 terms of Presidency, it's also a universe where in the times after WWII ordinary citizens decided that crime and corruption throughout America, and especially New York had gotten to levels beyond the control of authorities that they would suit up as masked vigilantes, and fight crime head on. By 1985 masked heroes are outlawed, and former ""heroes"" were forced to reveal themselves, or stay hidden, but give up their lifestyle.<br/><br/>The story of the most part is told through the eyes of one character Rorschach (Haley) as he investigates the murder of a fellow vigilante, The Comedian (Morgan). Rorschach is the only vigilante who has not given up the lifestyle, and is wanted by the F.B.I. Rorschach tries to re-engage the remaining ""heroes"" to help him find the murderer, and get to the heart of why he was murdered. The other ""heroes"" are Night Owl II (Wilson); an aging recluse who inherited a fortune from his father and used it to engage in vigilante activities, Silk Spectre II (Ackerman); daughter of an original Minutewoman (Cugino), Ozymandias (Goode), a self made millionaire who has modeled himself and his life on Alexander the Great, and Dr. Manhattan (Crudup), the only real superhero due an accident in a atomic chamber in a lab when he was a physicist.<br/><br/>The film follows pretty closely the themes and tone of the book, much more than any comic related movie before it, thanks mostly to the dedication of director Zack Snyder. The look and feel of the film to date it in 1985 was very well handled, and can certainly be called a period piece due to the level of exact detail through-out. Performances are in general pretty well done, and reflect the emotions of the characters in the book, as this is the Ultimate Cut, the extended scenes, plus the interwoven story of the comic book within a comic book; ""Tales of The Black Freighter"" make for a film that is worthy of its 215 minute length. Having said that they leave well and truly enough of the story in the theatrical cut where the message still shines through.<br/><br/>The credits for this film are the best I have ever seen, using the Bob Dylan song ""The Times They Are A-Changing"", and features snapshots of the highs and lows of the Minutemen and Watchmen from the 1940's through to the 1980's against the backdrop of important cultural and political icons and events.<br/><br/>This movie is easily one of my favourites of the modern age of film, because of the well delivered message, and the uncompromised approach to bring the graphic novel to life."

","I was excited about this movie as I thought it would be another great superhero comic book movie like Spider-man, The Dark Knight, Iron Man, Fantastic Four or the X-men-trilogy. How wrong I was! This movie is the total opposite. Here's why: 1) There is only one true superhero and he is super-boring as he has zero emotions and looks more like a sexual version of the Oscar statuette. The other characters aren't superheroes and thus they are futile as characters - they never seem to matter in the storyline. Also: the only interesting character is a guy called the comedian but then he is annoying in everything he says or does.<br/><br/>2) The action is only impressive in the first scene; everything else is flat and dull.<br/><br/>3) The storyline is wáy too complex. The story switches back and forth too many times and we get too much information of which none of it seems to matter. There is also too much political crap rather than some good superhero-action. The voice-over is interesting to begin with but after a couple of minutes, it feels like some kind of failed, wanna-be Max Payne-video game voice-over. And what's with the music? At times songs play during scenes in this movie that have no substance whatsoever; like the restaurant scene that has ""99 Luftballons"" by Nena playing all of a sudden.<br/><br/>4) The so-called cool darkness in this movie wánts to be like ""300"" or ""Sin city"", but it's just plain boring.<br/><br/>In short: IF this movie will please any fans at all, they will most likely almost be all fanboys of the comic-book. This movie will NOT become a mainstream-success; I can guarantee you that! The characters are boring (even the superhero guy is plain stupid), the storyline is ridiculously complex with nonsense and seems to head for absolutely no point whatsoever.<br/><br/>2009 WILL have a great comic-book movie (""Wolverine"") but it will not be this one ...<br/><br/>Watchmen?

It is utterly atrocious and I hope the people who made it learn that the general public demands some thought and quality control when it comes to story. Only go and see it if you get a kick out of bad bad movies.

Dull as dirt dialog, ridiculous transitions that made absolutely no sense, this may have stuck to the ""graphic novel"" but in terms of good film making, it fell horribly short. The scenes that Jackie Earl Haley were in had a semblance of relativity but as some of the more graphic special effects meted out, they were not enough to create any depth to Jackie's character. I was very excited about the potential of this film after seeing the directors other films, sadly there was never a time during the 2 hours and 43 minutes where I wasn't thinking that I really needed to beat some dirty laundry against the rocky shores of any local river or tributary.

I went to an advanced screening of the film in Orlando on March 2nd and people starting leaving the theater about 30-minutes into the film. Shortly afterward, others followed, and about 15% of the once capacity crowd left the theater by the first hour. The pacing of the movie was a bit odd for an action film. I would actual call this a drama with scenes of action (although the trailers would lead you to believe this is a full on action packed movie). At nearly 2 hours and 45 minutes, this film was too long. Several times in the film, when a scene ended that appeared to be the end of the movie, people started gathering their belongings to exit the theater, and then the next scene would begin. This story could easily been told in less than 2 hours, which would have made the movie more exciting.<br/><br/>This is an R rated movie which made for some great action sequences, with lots of blood and guts. There are also several sex scenes and frontal nudity of Dr. Manhattan every 15-minutes which not only seemed unnecessary but makes the the film even more inappropriate for younger viewers.<br/><br/>The only stand out performance in my opinion was Jackie Haley's performance as Rorschach. When the movie finally ended, the theater emptied in silence, unlike some other recent films I've seen like ""Taken"" or ""Gran Turino"" where the preview audience applauded at the end of the movie. I agree with other comments that if you read the book, you will enjoy the movie more. This is definitely one of those love it or hate movies, and I'm happy I didn't pay to see this.

The movie was a blatant assault on the brain, the senses and the stomach. (And a complete waste of a free movie ticket and 2 hours or so of my life – I'm SO blessed I didn't pay MONEY for it.) WatchFreaks was unnecessarily violent and gory – and I had to struggle to forget about the blood & guts for my ancient Greek dinner that night – I SO wasn't going to let this complete washout spoil my very special $90 dinner. <br/><br/>That said, WashOut Men started off wonderfully with the song ""Times they are a changing."" Showing real heroes with real problems and real lives. The fact that the heroes were anything but was interesting and real people - and it sported to be a good movie, but sadly went downhill from there in a Southerly direction.<br/><br/>And after the novelty of seeing Mr Manhattan completely starkers wore off, his character bugged me, he's supposed to e altruistic and he's blasting the guts out of unarmed people that had dropped their weapons and were running away - so he knows death is a transition, but what right has he to make those decisions for others?<br/><br/>The ending was a surprise, the actually did 'destroy the world' – or a large chunk of it to bring peace, so to speak - so that was an interesting twist - BUT this movie would've been way better sans a greta deal of the blood, guts and brainless violence. At least Rorschach's journal tells the truth.<br/><br/>Our so called heroes seemed so happy to get out of their spandex and lead 'normal' lives and then they couldn't wait to don their costumes again, save people, in Lori's case, flick their hair in the face of a blasting backdraft, kick the crap out of a few nondescript bad guys (and since when do heroes actually *kill* street punks?) That scene was so tagged on. Then the 'heroes' couldn't wait to get out of the lycra again to bang each other Lori (Silly Spandex Girl) was a brainless bint who could never make up her mind finally toward the end she grew a brain cell when she really realized her power and feelings for Mr Penis.<br/><br/>The useless jail scene could have been completely cut out, (save the audience more wasted time) - yet another excuse for more blood and gore and Silly Spandex Girl running about, hair flicking in the jail break. It was also disappointing to see Rorschach's human face then - Would have been *much* more powerful to only show that at the end. Oh well  At least in the end, Mr Potato face and Mr Dicky found their peace.<br/><br/>Despite this, I did enjoy my dinner thank you very much. I may not look good in spandex or have long, perfect silky hair to flick in the face of imminent danger, but I do have the power of inner strength, stamina and being true to myself and do not need to hide behind a mask."

"jaredmobarak","9","6","15","2 March 2009"," The end is nigh  Watchmen
","After twenty years the ultimate graphic novel, a tale many hold to be amongst the greatest stories ever written, illustrated or not, has finally been brought to cinematic life. Warner Bros. needs to be given a lot of credit for taking the chance, rolling the dice, and ultimately paying the price (Fox sucks) to allow it all to be told on screen as it should. With Zack Snyder at the helm and co-creator Dave Gibbons along for the ride, Watchmen becomes a visceral assault on our sensibilities, our morals, and our existence in just the same way the novel did with its dark and cynically written prose. Yes, there are changes, in both the details and the big events, but in the end it all comes down to the same question. What is an acceptable price to be paid for the continuation of humanity? It's a question that one hopes will never be alive to watch the results of, but in a time of aggression, paranoia, and fearnot knowing whether the enemy would strike first, but always ready to strike backwhere oblivion was an inevitability, it begs for an answer, no matter how atrocious the truth may be.<br/><br/>The beauty of the novel lies in the details. With immense scope and mythology, each character was given a complete history, an origin to the man or woman each became. Snyder and company don't turn their backs on this fact, allowing the film to proceed with its disjointed narrative, going back and forth between the present and the past that came before. We catch glimpses of how each evolved into the people they've become, whether that be even more invested in his convictions, (Rorschach), living a lie that the best times of her life were forced upon her by a mother who's limelight was fading, (Silk Spectre), lazy and out of shape from the fear that replaced the confidence when the costume was shut away in the basement, (Nite Owl II), or a self-made millionaire with a grip on business and government, (Ozymandias). Everything shown leads up to the climax in which each member of Watchmen rejoin with the fate of the world on the table and the impossible choice to either be made or stopped.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the cinematic version is flawed because of the exact same issue. With so much detail and intricacy of plot and characterization, something has to be left on the cutting room floor. Personally, I believe the filmmakers made the perfect maneuvers to solve the problem of overkill. However, for someone to come in, without any knowledge of the story they are about to experience, it can be very daunting, very inaccessible, and ultimately unworthy of their time. What becomes a masterpiece of tone and literary adaptation for those familiar with the mythology ends up just a boring, bloated, action-less superhero saga that causes more laughter and headshaking then fervor or intrigue. As a result, Watchmen is more of a companion piece to the novel, something to view in conjunction with what is one of American literature's finest works.<br/><br/>But enough of that small point of contention; there is just too much more to love. You cannot deny the sheer brilliance of the special effects work, from the glowing blue body of Manhattan to the flying Archie to the beauty of Mars. The fight choreography is superb, just the right mix of sharp cuts and extended sequences to show the actual hits and not just the contact. Action fans will not be disappointed with the quality here, just the quantity. And as for direction, Snyder uses the novel as a guideline/storyboard pre-destined for the Cineplex, breathing life into the two-dimensional page. So much is almost exact to Gibbons' drawings and so much is crammed into every frame. Just watching the opening credit sequence shows the care for detail that was taken, showing so much to make the fan cry for joy and the newcomer scratch his head in confusion. I don't even fault the decision to alter the ending, allowing the climax to be more relevant for the real world yet still maintaining the same ultimate end. To stick to the book here would have alienated even more people into dismissing the story as a misguided farce rather then the biting political/social commentary it is.<br/><br/>The one thing I believe everyone can appreciate, though, is the stellar cast. With Malin Akerman being the only weak link, (sorry my dear, you look the part, but just don't quite have the acting chops yet to pull it off), there is little left to be desired. Billy Crudup's passive monotone is exactly what you'd imagine from Manhattan, Matthew Goode's affluent inflection and precise delivery of his words just the right amount of ego and genius Ozymandias contains, and Patrick Wilson's bumbling loner-geek brings Dan Dreiberg to life, showing all the insecurities that vanish when inside the Nite Owl suit. Where the true brilliance lies, however, is with Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach. Morgan's unceasing grin and amorality shows both the loathsome nature of his existence as well as the ultimate mirror showing the world its true face of greed, corruption, and selfishness. He truly is the embodiment of the American Dream. And Haley's Rorschach becomes our entry-point and guide to the tale. His skewed sense of reality and justice makes him a villain, a murdering criminal, yet you can't help but wish you could have his conviction and fearlessness to do whatever it takes. The ultimate badass, his Walter Kovacs might be the most flawed role of the bunch, but that just makes him even more likable and relatable because, in the end, we are all flawed creatures pretending to be righteous and good."

The story line in the movie is awful. The editing is awful. Do not see this movie. 7.6 for total crap. Do not get it. This has got to be one of the worst action movies ever. I do not know why people like this movie. There are so many action movies out there that are well made. This is no one of them.

","Or just watch the trailer and the opening. They're much more enjoyable than the movie. Jeez I'm so disappointed... When I saw the trailer, I thought it would be a good movie. Not as great as the comic (adaptation is a hard exercise), but not that lame... See, I quite liked 300, Snyder respected the original, and it was possible because Frank Miller's work is more graphical, and does not suffer from exaggeration since it is inherent to it. While Watchmen is a much more subtle and intellectual work. and it DOES suffer from trying inadequately to turn its characters into teenage-version of ""cool"". Man, I almost cried when Laurie and Nite Owl dressed up for their outing. Watchmen characters HAVE a sense of ridicule. They wouldn't think themselves ""hot"". And though I can understand the need to add some action scenes to make the movie more attractive to teenagers, there was no need to all those slowing downs... As for the music... urrrgh! cliché upon cliché. I cannot list all the reasons why this movie is bad. Really, it was a painful experience. Awkward, silly, and an insult to the original."
"bluegrace","1","5","12","3 August 2009"," Does C Bale know they ripped him off?
","The kindest thing I can say about this movie is that the actor that plays Rorschach does an awfully great Dark Knight impression throughout the movie. And the music, well, displayed some interesting choices.<br/><br/>The worst - it was about 2 hours too long, and I'll never get that time back, with or without the help of Dr Manhattan. It took over 1.5 hours for significant plot development to occur. One is left with the impression that the editors measured out time for each character, and even if it meant boring the crap out of the audience, those scenes were going to stay.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the graphic novels, you'd probably enjoy this. Otherwise, I don't know why you would waste your time.<br/><br/>I felt angry after watching it. I'm sure this wasn't the point. I was pretty much cheering for the total annihilation of the Watchmen world, and wondered why anyone in this realm or that one would care one way or the other. Let the sequel script burn. It would be better for this dimension if they do."

With all of the good ideas out there in regular books, comic books, manga & graphic novels, THIS is what they choose to make into a movie.

"gangstahippie","9","5","12","20 May 2009"," Extremely underrated, very faithful adaptation and probably one of the greatest superhero movies of all time!
","I honestly cannot believe how underrated Watchmen is.It did not make a profit during it's theatrical release(though it did pretty good).It also seems to have a lot of haters on the IMDb forums.The reviews were mixed.I think it's one of those movies you will have to watch more than once.It has a fairly complicated storyline and I got lost at times when I saw it.However, overall I enjoyed the movie greatly.I picked up the original 1986 graphic novel and have since finished reading it.It was a bit better than the film, but just a bit! Director Zack Snyder made a very faithful adaptation to a comic deemed ""unfilmable"".Yes the ending has changed and there are some other things missing(though these might be included in the extended cuts of the film to be released on DVD).The ""Black Freighter"" & newsstand scenes are gone(though I didn't much care for the black freighter parts), there are also a few other changes.The film is also more violent than the novel.The plot of the film starts off with a superhero named ""The Comedian"" getting brutally beaten and thrown through a window.Then a masked vigilante named ""Rorshach"" investigates his murder, while warning his old superhero friends.The rest of the film involves flashbacks of the superheroes, showing how the 1977 Keene act banned vigilantism forcing the heroes into retirement, as well as a romance between Nite-Owl and Silk Spectre(two other heroes).Watchmen is an unconventional superhero movie.Do not compare it to ""Dark Knight"" or ""Spider-Man"".It's bloody, R-rated, thought provoking and not for young kids.This is another reason why people did not like it, they didn't know what to expect.Anyway, the film is a must for fans of the graphic novel.Others might probably enjoy the thought provoking superhero film.There is quite a bit of action as well!"

I found boring the parts in which Sally Jupiter / Silk Spectre & Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II are together. I think that this movie could have been much better.<br/><br/>Because of the murder of one of the watchmen (The Comedian), Rorschach is going to make an investigation to find the murder who may be trying to kill all the watchmen; and at the same time there is a great probability of a war world 3 between USA and URSS ......<br/><br/>If you like this kind of superheros movies give it a try otherwise don't.<br/><br/>6.5 = regular +"
"megamattw-198-421434","6","4","9","15 May 2015"," More like DontWatch-Men
","Where do I begin. This movie has more padding than a hookers bra. This movie feels more like an instruction manual for the comic than actually trying to adapt it into a film. At times it shows how promising it could have been if only Hack Snyder wasn't at the helm. The biggest let down of the film has to be its lack of color. When I think of watchmen, I think of bright yellows and deep blues. But the only blue came from my extreme lack of interest during this 3 hour snooze fest. Don't get me stares on the whole comic within a comic side plot. I don't care if it was needed or not. It killed any sense of pace this film might have had.<br/><br/>Now I bet your wondering if this movie is that bad why does it get a 6. Well the one saving grace for this movie is the action. Every fight scene is filled with vibrant amounts of blood and fire. It makes a crime scene look like a work of art and it is wonderful. The action is also slowed down enough to give you the sense your watching a comic panel. All in all it is a below average comic movie with a lot of heart but no pay off. Stay away and go watch Heros. It's almost the same plot but with a lot more time to build up the characters."
"ianmitchell-45214","1","4","9","18 April 2015"," I knew I shouldn't have watched it.
","Okay, unlike a lot of the other negative reviews, I had read the graphic novel many times in my childhood. My dad was a very good friend of Alan Moore in their younger days and as a boy I was always captivated by one specific book on my Dads books-shelves of various books. Obviously, I was attracted to the eye-catching images of blood trickling down the book and mysterious masked people on the cover. After reading the book, I'd fallen in love. My dad, being a friend of Alan Moore, had loads of his work such as Swamp Thing, From Hell, Killing Joke e.t.c but my Dad told me he always loved telling Alan that his two oldest children (me and my sis) would always read his Watchmen book (despite us being too young and this did shock Alan that we both liked it). I remember my Dad telling me Warner Bros royally screwed Alan over by taking the rights to his material and making movies out of them. BOY, WAS HE RIGHT? The minute I heard a Watchmen movie was being made, both my Dad and I (and Alan too) knew it'd be crap. You'd think going in with low expectations would make the film better, right? Nope! It was as awful as I knew it would be. My fave character in the book was Rorschach. He had this atmosphere and rawness about his character in the book I'd never seen before. I'd have cast someone like Guy Pearce to play him. Someone who could pull that cold hard stare while delivering frightening dialogue. For me, Jackie Earl Healey came across more like Jonny Rotten from The Sex Pistols. Malin Ackerman was AWWWWFUL. The fight scenes were silly and ruined the original tone. Also, the guy cast for Ozymandius did not have that annoyingly Aryan chiselled good looks. They cast some average looking schmuck for him. I watched the film out of pure love of Alan Moores work. I bet he himself has not even laid eyes on this visual trash and I hope he never does."
"secondtake","6","4","9","28 September 2011"," As an outsider to this world I found it amazing and a bit boring, both. Read on...
","Watchmen (2009)<br/><br/>This is one of those could-have-been movies. It has stunning graphic effects, great gloomy urban mood, lots of wild and curious characters, a superhero plot laden with doubts and human angst, and some ongoing complexity that makes you pay attention.<br/><br/>But there is also an ironic sameness to it all, a similar plodding through, with all the excitement and drama built in all along. There are two large goals to the events. <br/><br/>One is establishing the details of a group of superheroes famous from mid-Twentieth Century America. They meet and they talk, but they talk a lot, surprisingly, when you'd rather see something happen. There are flashbacks, lots of them, and good ones, but the point of them is to fill in the characters, and to suggest some lingering personal problems between them in the past (including relationships that have gone wrong). The point of all this is not only to dovetail plot details, but to make the characters very human, whatever their inhuman powers.<br/><br/>The second is a current problem in a fictional America, set in the 1970s with Nixon enjoying a third term (and Nixon, Kissinger, and some of the other players of those times make appearances). Nuclear war seem imminent. These retired or dysfunctional superheroes are woken up from their withdrawal from society (earlier forced out of service by a government decree) when one of their group dies (the one who dies, the Comedian, seems actually to be a very bad man overall, not a shining good guy). Something is going wrong, and it seems that these superheroes might be required to act, even illegally, to save themselves.<br/><br/>If only their interpersonal squabbles weren't so heavy and damaging. If only they knew who killed the Comedian. If only there was some momentum in this gathering together the past and focussing on the immediate crisis. If only the director had not assumed every viewer was already familiar with the characters, and enamored with them the way you get sucked into comic book heroes.<br/><br/>So even though you can't stop watching because it's so visually interesting, the movie gets ponderous at times, many times, and a little overly simple in its psychology and its Cold War plot. I had never heard of the Watchmen or the legendary graphic novel (extended narrative comic book) that precedes the movie. Diving in fresh, I make associations with superheroes I do know (a lot of them, from older comic books and the many movies in the last decade or two). I tried to learn the powers and flaws of this group (they are ambiguous, beyond their fistfighting prowess, men and women both). And there is the exceptional Dr. Manhattan who seems to have God-like powers, waving a hand and disassembling a tank in mid-air then crushing it into a ball of shards without moving from his stiff, upright position, glowing a nice blue radiation of some kind.<br/><br/>And stiffness? That's a problem all along. As human as everyone is, they have a kind of cardboard or styrofoam acting style. Oh, I know they are cartoons, but still, emotion becomes suggested or told or acted, not expressed. I'm not sure if this is on purpose, keeping the effect like the emotions in a flat, fake character. (If you don't know comic books at all, picture the ""emotion"" of a person in a Lichtenstein painting--it's a symbolic expression of something, not a real expression.)<br/><br/>For me this is all fascinating but not as involving as I would have liked. I mean, if you compare to the obvious, like a Batman or Spiderman movie, you see a different visual effect in much of it, and it's distinctive and very smart and actually refreshing. But it lacks the propelling plot and the compelling characters, period. For me, as a novice to this world, which I assume many or most viewers can relate to. Still, it's really different, and worth at least a partial look to give it a shot."
"epakorrekti-925-19171","2","4","9","13 February 2011"," Who will save us now from these kind of movies?
","I'm one of those guys who didn't read the book before seeing this thing, and I highly doubt I would like to read it after seeing this.<br/><br/>The movie starts with very confusing history reel. We are introduced about 15 characters in few minutes while the opening credits are rolling. Then we jump straight into first action scene, fight between two people. The effects are quite nice and the fight choreography is good, but since I don't know who these people are, I'm not interested at all. After that, the actual story starts and we slowly get some details about the characters, some random details that is. The story telling in this movie is so awful that I cannot tell where to start. Out of the six main superheroes, only two have a background story in this movie. There is a lot of flashbacks to history, but about half of them doesn't bring anything reasonable into the story. There are also some other superheroes who are retired, or something. Actually, some of the main superheroes have also retired, or something. It's hard to tell, since the movie really doesn't explain stuff.<br/><br/>Calling these folk superheroes is bit misleading, since some of them are not super and some of them are not heroic. It is not clear how these folk got their powers or even if they have any powers. In one scene it is explained that they are just regular folk with costumes and in another scene it is explained that it would take an extraordinary person to take them out. Only one character is truly explained in the movie, Dr.Manhattan, that clearly has SUPERpowers. Part of the Rorschach's background is also revealed, making these two the most interesting characters in the movie. Unfortunately the movie decides to focus more on the Nite Owl and Silkspectre II characters, and the background stories of the characters who do not have much to do with the actual story.<br/><br/>There are some action scenes. When Rorschach is doing the action, it is awesome. When Owl-Spectre duo is doing the action, it is repetitive and dull. When these two are fighting, it's just loads of very poorly timed attacks and blocks. Rest of the characters seem just to focus on talking. We do see some action from the past, where our 'heroes' mostly kill and maim unarmed people with very little reason to do so. Nevertheless, it seems that this movie is not so much about action, but about deep characters, intelligent plot and mind blowing philosophic insights. As said, the characters are not presented well enough for the viewer to get into them. When their motivations are not clear, it's hard to understand their actions or whatever they are talking about. That leaves only the plot and philosophy to hold the movie together.<br/><br/>Story in short: There's a threat of nuclear war between USA and Soviet Union. Also, one of the heroes has been murdered. It's quite simple and very clearly presented. The problem lies in the totally ridiculous issues in the plot. First, the Dr.Manhattan is practically a god. He's like Superman and Professor Xavier at the same time. Yet, he seems to be focusing only in whining and his motivations are in several cases unbelievably retarded. Second, the logic behind the denouement is totally absurd. The movie is terrible long and just when I'm getting a grasp what's going on, and getting hyped on with the action, the movie tosses perhaps the most stupidest thing I ever encountered in my whole life on my face. It's hard to explain without giving spoilers, but it's truly insulting if you bother to think about it. So the story is quite simple and ruined with useless ending.<br/><br/>Some claim this movie to have bigger than life elements, and it does. Too bad that all these elements are as thin as a pool of kitty pee on the carpet. I do see that the movie tries to build some society philosophy insights, but only a brainless monkey would be startled with this movie. If you want to see a movie that makes you ponder the life and society, then go see La battaglia di Algeri or Le salaire de la peur. Those movies truly have some deeper meaning, but they also have good storytelling, unlike this mess.<br/><br/>If this movie was all about Rorschach, then it would have been great! But as it is, it's absolutely horrible and should be avoided, especially by those who haven't read the book."
"aakash-karkare","2","4","9","4 December 2010"," Another terrible adaptation
","Alan Moore made an excellent statement while commenting on comic book to film adaptation or book to film adaptations. He said that while reading a comic book the viewer is in control of the viewing experience so he can interpret the scene in his own particular view but the movie shows it one certain way and that is what makes it dull or dreary.<br/><br/>Now I am a huge fan of the comic book. Watchmen is one of the greatest works of fiction of the last century. It is not just a deconstruction of the superhero genre or a parody. It is so much more. It has the capacity and scope of 1984 and Brave New World but takes it to a whole new level. It is visionary and an extremely readable work of art.<br/><br/>I could spend the entire review just nitpicking on what scenes matched or didn't match to the original comic book but I wont or rather I cannot. The movie has just picked up every panel on every page and just made it live action. The dialogue, scenes and everything is the same. It doesn't add anything to the work bu just makes it very terrible.<br/><br/>Zak Snyder though a good director seems to me to an extremely dumb person. I guess he is another one of those directors that cite Steven Spielberg as an influence. Now, while Spielberg is a great storyteller and picks up interesting stories to tell all his protégé turn out to be some of the worst directors Hollywood has produced. Snyder hasn't understood the graphic novel. He must have loved the visually arresting artwork and that is where his admiration ended. He didn't care for the politics or the characters and their turmoils or any of the other important stuff that really matters. It is evident from his movies that he cares more about visuals that substance, more about style than character development. <br/><br/>Now if you divorce the film from its subject matter and watch it without knowing of Alan Moore and his graphic novel I guess you could call it good film. You could justify the acclaim that it got but that is not the case. It owes everything to the original novel by Moore and Gibbons. It owes everything.<br/><br/>Brian. K. Vaughn , the writer of Y : The Last Man was told to write the screenplay for his own work. And he changed a few things and reworked the plot. The execs at New Line were not happy as they wanted to be faithful to the original book. Vaughn said that you cannot be so religious in your adaptation. Things must change from medium to medium. And that is what Snyder fails to comprehend. Even with his Dawn of the Dead. Even with 300. He is Michael Bay with more story. <br/><br/>The stupidity of Snyder is evident when Rorschach's voice-over begins "" Rorschach's journal ....."" Now why would he say that over and over again . Voice-over implies thought and the person doesn't refer to himself in his 2nd person. The book did it because the journal entries were separate. They weren't in the story but were separate from the plot but Snyder couldn't have one intelligent idea of his own. <br/><br/>Overall Snyder's Watchmen is hardly the best movie of 2009. It is hardly a good movie. Snyder further establishes himself as a director who hasn't a single original thing to say."

"MarsBar101","9","4","9","27 June 2009"," Generally faithful adaptation brought down by a few flaws
","Watchmen is, for the most part, a very good film. It examines many different ideologies and allows the viewer to question them self over what is 'right' or whether it is even possible to qualify what 'right' means.<br/><br/>The plot is about a group of vigilantes who, following an investigation into the death of an old partner, uncover a shocking and morally questionable conspiracy.<br/><br/>A number of different and fascinating characters are presented, each with a different view of the world. This brings up a slew of moral possibilities for the viewer to consider. The film is a welcome break from the 'junk food' cinema that seems to dominate the multiplexes.<br/><br/>That said, the film is plagued with a few problems that prevent it from being the masterpiece the comic was. The main flaw is the loss of ambiguity of the ending. In the comic, the reader has no idea what happens after the final panel. This is done so that we can decide for ourselves what we want to happen, leaving it to us to decide what we think is morally right given the situation. The film however, leans much more in favor of one character, almost forcing it on the viewer that this character's world-view is the correct one. This is presumptuous on the part of the scriptwriters and goes against the core concept of the original work, that being that it is up to all of us to decide what constitutes right and wrong.<br/><br/>Apart from that, there are some smaller flaws such as the pacing, the soundtrack and some of the acting (though most of the actors do a fantastic job). These can be overlooked fairly easily though, leaving the one main problem.<br/><br/>All in all, Watchmen is a better film than most others out there now. It is an intellectual work with great atmosphere and some superb acting. Well worth your time."

","Snyder did a fine job with his adaptation of Watchmen. He captured the essence of the graphic novel within the restraints of a 2 hours or so movie. Watchmen was in 1985 a new take on the superhero genre which by then had really degenarated after Stan lee's successful revival of the genre in the 60s. One could argue that Spiderm,an was the first coming of age of the superhero and Watchmen the second one. Watchmen is a a brilliant take on the nature of men and on the nature of evil. We have the almost existentialist Rorschach who is so much lost in his almost absurd struggle against evil that he has lost all personality behind his mask; the completely evil Comedian who finds his place in society because it needs evil people; Dr Manhattan who becomes so detached from the human race that he views them in complete ataraxia; Night Owl and Silk Spectre who represent the Everyman who tries to find the right way and proto-fascist Ozymandias. Essentially the film revolves around his plot to save the world (set in a parallel universe in which the US won the war in Vietnam and Nixon is still President but superheros are outlawed) from nuclear war by wreaking death and destruction on New York. And here lies the moral question: if men is evil or at least incapable of living peacefully, does anyone have the right to force us into living peacefully? Does the end justify the means? The amoral dr manhattan seems to think so, uncompromising Rorschach doesn't and Silk Spectre and Might Owl are caught in the middle. Everyone is flawed excepr dr Manhattan and that's the point: he is not human anymore. All in all the story is incredibly complex but well told up to the final irony when it turns out it was all in vain and a complete moron is responsible for it. I don't know why Moore had problems with the film as Snyder did a really good job. He captured all that was essential to the story. The use of music was very good in the film and a nice substitute for Moore's quotes in the graphic novel. My only misgivings are the drawn out action sequences which at times make the film something in between and art house movie and an action film. The acting is terrific. Each actor really captures the character brilliantly and the fact that they play the characterts throughout their loives is an impressive proof of their acting abilities."
"moviemaniac008","10","4","9","11 April 2009"," Parents, be aware! Watchmen is no kids' movie!
","Wow, am I ever impressed with how superhero films have been lately! I mean, we kicked off summer 2008 with Iron Man (which was excellent), the comical action movie ''Hancock'' then we had one of the most visually impressive movie I have ever seen (Hellboy 2: The Golden Army), the outstanding and incredible ''Dark Knight'', the very good (I'm not talking excellent quality, but just some good, old, explosive fun) Punisher: War Zone. The Incredible Hulk, while not outstanding, wasn't bad and now we have this movie, Watchmen. And besides The Dark Knight, Watchmen topples all of the movies I named, and by far. Not only is it excessively visually impressive, but it is another creative take on the darker side of the superhero genre.<br/><br/>If you have seen Zack Snyder's breakout films, which are Dawn of the Dead (the 2004 film, which has got to be the best remake out there) or 300 (another piece of visual quality), then you probably know what to expect from Watchmen. So while this is a superhero movie, please note (if you are a parent), that Watchmen has it's load of graphic, gory violence, profanity, and shots of blue Dr. Manhattan penises and and of actress Malin Akerman's breasts. Please also be aware that it's based off a graphic novel, and not a comic book. This doesn't matter much to some people, but to me, it's like comparing a Spider-Man or a Superman comic with the excessively violent Sin City, which was later turned into a movie rated ''R'', and earned a 16+ rating in my province. I was in a room with a lot of parents with young children, and there were scenes I was shocked to see young children in the theater room, and believe it or not, some parent dragged his son home before the attempted rape scene with The Comedian and Sally Jupiter. However, while not a children movie, it is more than just a delight for the older viewer.<br/><br/>I won't do a plot summary for this one, as I am scared to give out spoilers, but I will undeniably speak of the artistic quality. The actors were not excellent, just Okay, with perhaps the exception of Billy Crudup (Dr. Manhattan), Jackie Earle Hayley (Rorschach) and Jeffery Dean Morgan (the Comedian), but the visual effects steal the show. Zack Snyder uses again the same slow-motion action as in 300, and believe me, it never gets old. The script is also good quality. It shows us an alternative version of the United States where Snyder and the scriptwriters question themselves on how the History of America would have been if superheroes would have lived with us since the 1940's. Thus, we are shown many events of the American History, transformed with intelligent and creative, yet accurately false depictions of the Vietnam War, or the assassination of JFK to name a few.<br/><br/>Go ahead, people, spend your money. It is rare a movie as visually impressive as Watchmen is released."
"dunmore_ego","9","4","9","8 April 2009"," Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!
","And the fanboys whine like bitches. The ""unfilmable"" graphic novel, WATCHMEN - has been filmed! Cry the beloved comicbook and let slip the dogs of nihilism.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN is epic and sexy and bloody; sensual and visceral and brutal; more than a comicbook, more than a messianic cry of madness; flamboyant costumed heroes, a plot that shakes the world and Dr. Manhattan in full frontal ectoplasm.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN is a triumph! ...Unless you're a fanboy.<br/><br/>The Rorschach Test: One Fan's Classic is Another Fan's Bubastis.<br/><br/>And the writer of the graphic novel, Alan Moore (V FOR VENDETTA, 2005) has once again spat the dummy and insisted his name be removed from the WATCHMEN movie, leaving only mediocre artist, Dave Gibbons, credited as ""co-creator."" There's perfectionist - and there's bitchboy. Alan Moore is the latter.<br/><br/>Directed by Zack Snyder like the graphic novel panels are emblazoned on the insides of his eyelids, WATCHMEN the movie - like VENDETTA - is ardently true to the spirit of the source material and reverently recreates the world of an alternate 1985, where Nixon has been in office continually since the Viet Nam victory (!), where costumed heroes are part of the crimefighting landscape, where colors scream and morals bend and we hit the ground running in thigh-high boots that are not removed for mile-high sex.<br/><br/>The opening montage, showing how the world assimilated these heroes into its culture, is crafted with such care and creativity (with source music from Dylan to Hendrix), I shed a tear at watching the pages of Watchmen come alive. And this was only the opening! <br/><br/>Under the Hood: Battle not with Monsters, Lest ye become a Monster...<br/><br/>WATCHMEN (written by mad prophet bitchboy Alan Moore, drawn by Dave Gibbons, published in 1986 by DC Comics as a limited 12-issue series) is a ""celebrated graphic novel"" because the fantasy world it presents train-wrecks into our reality so closely it hurts our Gotham nerve.<br/><br/>BATMAN BEGINS (2005) portended this trend of superhero films being no longer the provenance of teens vicariously living out fantasies with towels tied around necks; THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) continued this journey; now WATCHMEN takes it beyond the Bubastis, raising the bar into dark adulthood, where every sin is a necessity, every moral an ambiguity.<br/><br/>None of the heroes have supernatural powers; except for the atomic anomaly, Dr. Manhattan (victim of an ""intrinsic field chamber"" accident and able to manipulate molecules at will, and perceive future time streams), they are all versions of Batman and Captain America, well-trained and well-educated athletes with a penchant for vigilantism.<br/><br/>And vigilantism - as in this real world - is only tolerated so long. Nixon outlaws ""masks"" (as costumed heroes come to be called) - after they help him win Viet Nam, mind you! - and we are thrust into this roaring, breathing work of art during the second generation of masks after they are disbanded.<br/><br/>When one of the Watchmen, the abrasive, cynical Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, love-child of Robert Downey Jnr. and Mickey Rourke) is killed mysteriously, the last Watchman on active duty, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), goes on a solitary manhunt to find the killer.<br/><br/>He warns fellow ex-Watchman, Dan aka Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), ""An attack on one is an attack on all of us!"" Rorschach is the nihilistic conscience of WATCHMEN, a sociopath with principles, wearing a mask that shifts its Rorschach ink-blot patterns continually. He considers this shifting palette his ""true face"" - mirroring the ineffable, morally relativistic face of the New York he holds no love for... ""The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout 'Save us!'... and I'll whisper 'No.'"" <br/><br/>As each Watchman entered the equation, I recognized them immediately - the last such perfect casting being X-MEN (2000). There was, of course, Rorschach's wondrous ever-changing mask; the worrisome dweeb with the weak Chevy Chase lips had to be Dan Dreiber aka Nite Owl II (the faux-Batman guy); the bumblebee hooker with the Pert hair and bad bangs must be Laurie aka Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman); the Bowie-thin Brit is Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) and lemme take a guess that the shimmering blue, hung, naked buff is Jon Osterman aka Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup).<br/><br/>And my own chiseled six-pack hardened with delight when I saw Ozymandias's exotic, mutated lynx, Bubastis! WATCHMEN is a wet dream waterfall.<br/><br/>The key to WATCHMEN, the grand concept that elevates it above the jungle of super-beings who bust bank-robbers and petty thieves (which are merely the outlying strands of a much larger sociological problem) is Ozymandias saying, ""I fought only the symptoms, leaving the disease unchecked."" Now, as Nixon and the Soviets edge toward nuclear war, Ozymandias, ""the world's smartest man"" with unlimited resources, takes it upon himself to attack the disease. To save humankind from itself.<br/><br/>Hero? Villain? Spandex-wearing looney? When Spock said ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,"" he was regarded as noble because he was sacrificing himself. Ozymandias plots to destroy life as part of a bigger plot to save life. The Comedian's death was a small cog in this world-shaking coup. And the moral dilemma falls to the other Watchmen to either stop him, or stop the truth being told.<br/><br/>Though Dr. Manhattan is acclaimed as, ""God exists - and he's American,"" Ozymandias's plan to kill millions to save billions is nothing short of godlike. (""...lest ye become a monster."") Superman saving kittens just wouldn't get it.<br/><br/>Thus the graphic novel's slogan: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes (Who is going to guard the guards themselves?), or simply, Who watches the Watchmen?<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber."
"tsancio","9","4","9","31 March 2009"," Excellent Movie from Dated Material
","Many people say that the Watchmen movie had a hard job to live up to its source material, the original graphic novel. But although it's an excellent asset in terms of its characters and philosophical underpinnings, the novel is a liability because it forces the director to create a revisionist historical science fiction movie. I mean, how do you recreate the tension of nuclear holocaust and transmit it to a public that is too young to remember it? How can you remember that it's in the 1980's when you see a flying owl-mobile? (Notice that I haven't read the novel)<br/><br/>When you forget the scenery because you're too busy watching the fight scenes and the 80's background starts to sound like a oldies radio station, you begin to pay attention to the sum of its parts instead of the whole.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Watchmen has great parts that shouldn't leave you disappointed. For example, the relatively-unknown three-name actors who play Rorschach and The Comedian. Their excellent work allows you to contemplate a couple of fully-drawn characters that are more psychopaths than superheroes. If you extract the Rorschach story from the movie, you could have a film that stands on its own.<br/><br/>Dr Manhattan, besides distracting you by being blue, CGI and naked, still has enough lines to make you imagine what it would be like to be a omnipotent entity that gets sick and tired of mingling with humans.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are very 300-like but since most of us forgot 300 and were embarrassed to rent it again, the speed slow-down and acceleration effect is a guilty joy to watch.<br/><br/>In essence, if you haven't read the novel and don't have any expectations for this movie ""changing your life"" or anything like it, you're certainly enjoy it for the visual treat and the sheer effort of each one of the people involved, specially the director and his actors."

The Watchmen tells the story of a group of not so heroic heroes, and as the film states one of them is killed and now the rest have to find out why. The Watchmen is an amazing visual feat that no comic book adaption has ever even come close to before. it has the same feel, the same style that the watchmen graphic novel did and I promise you, fans of the graphic novel will not be disappointed at all by this magnificent film, it's a treat for the eyes and the senses; and will keep you going all the way till the shocking end"

","I went to see this movie with high hopes for a good story with good special effects. I had enjoyed Zack Snyder's other movies. Unfortunately The Watchmen turned out to be a real disappointment and contained some of the most offensive material ever filmed.<br/><br/>What I really found objectionable and exploitive were the scenes depicting a child's body being eaten by dogs during one of Rorschach's flashbacks. Can someone please explain the value of this depiction to me? I am aware that the death and murder of children has been broached and depicted in other movies, Gone Baby Gone comes to mind. But this was far more graphic and sadistic than anything I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I have long felt that movie makers were crossing a line in portraying the terrorizing of and violence towards children. I have always believed that in crossing this line we are doing irreparable damage to our society which already has enough problems protecting our children. I just don't understand what would make a filmmaker sink to the level Snyder has sunk to in this movie.<br/><br/>I have to be candid and say that I would not have recommended this movies anyway. It was pretty tedious in parts and was difficult to follow. The special effects cannot make up for poor writing.<br/><br/>People should be warned to stay away from this film."

","I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I haven't yet gotten around to reading the books (although I still plan to), but after everything I've heard about the depth and weight of the source material, I figured that the movie would carry at least some of those elements over successfully. It so didn't.<br/><br/>What the movie became is a nearly incomprehensible three-hour mishmash of sub par acting, confusing flashbacks, corny dialog, and pseudo-intellectual claptrap. The characters, while very compelling on the surface, are developed so poorly that you never really care about any of them. You don't feel anything for the obvious tension and conflict that the director is trying to create. They're all just gloomy people in costumes.<br/><br/>And this is all particularly sad because at the same time, especially at the end, you get the feeling that there really was a great story in there that was trying to be told. Some very strong philosophical ideas appear, and you sort of realize that during the whole movie you just stammered through, maybe something of substance could have existed, but was completely squandered. The film does come together in the last 20 minutes or so, but by then its much, much too late."
"jm60154","10","4","9","7 March 2009"," I have had enough...
","From the moment I stepped out of the 12:01 a.m. showing of The Watchmen, I have heard nothing but bitching. Yes, the ending veers from the graphic novel's. Yes, this is not a ""POP CORN MOVIE"". And the obvious answer, yes, they are not typical super heroes.<br/><br/>The idea of this story was not to shock and aw the masses at the miraculous feats of strength or valor that these individuals could accomplish. The idea was to save humanity from its own apathetic instincts against all odds. DM and OM took this idea to the extreme, and with results. R and NO bolted down the ideology of a perfect morality of their own, limited results.<br/><br/>Then we come to the Comedian. This is one of the most revered characters' in the history of the DC cannon. If critics think that Zack Snyder gets at least one thing perfect (besides Rorschach), its Edward Blake. The normal viewer of this film should be expected to walk away hating this character. Yet again, Snyder pulls off his magic of allowing the audience to invite this antihero into the heart of the story.<br/><br/>Beyond the fact that the film was visually, audibly, and seamless in its entirety, critics need to take a step back and realize the depth and difficulty of such an adaptation. Yes the graphic novel is a one of a kind. No, there will never be an equal. But, as viewers, we should admire the achievement that we have had the privilege to witness. Alan Moore, with all right, may not appreciate the film because it was never written to be on the big screen. One should revel in the fact that his idea and story has been introduced to a wider audience.

"TheMovieDiorama","5","3","6","4 May 2020"," Watchmen bleakly tests the morals of disbanded superheroes whilst slowly counting down every heavy-handed minute of its overlong three hour doomsday clock.
","Rorschach's journal, May 4th. The year is '85, height of the Cold War. The ominous Soviet Union eagerly wages war against the United States. Nuclear warheads at the ready, to decimate this crime-ridden dark world. Tonight, a Comedian died in New York. Dead, tossed out of his fiftieth floor penthouse. His blood spread across the dank pavement. A yellow smiling badge is all that remains, with a drop of his hysterical blood. Coincidence that a member of the Watchmen had just been assassinated? A home robbery they say. Typical. The world doesn't care for another deceased superhero. That time has gone. The Keene Act made sure of that. ""Vigilantism"". That can't stop me. We are meant to exact justice! Anyway, all that matters now, is who is next on the list.<br/><br/>Snyder's hyper-stylised faithful adaptation of Gibbons and Moore's comic book series, is a dystopian superhero extravaganza reaching for its atmospheric aesthetic. An alternate timeline based on real events, notably the Cold War, ensures the ""costumed vigilantes"" are grounded in overtly bleak realism. Detailing the generational handover of self-sufficient justice, the retired ""Minutemen"" passing the heroic baton to the '""Watchmen"", in a world where violence conquers all. Snyder, along with frequent collaborator Fong's trademark cinematography, seamlessly depicts a gratuitous world where all hope is diminished. New York civilians nervously watching a ""Doomsday"" clock, symbolising the commencement of thermonuclear World War III. Superheroes unable to assist the public.<br/><br/>A blockbuster that touches upon differing tones for each member of the Watchmen. Rorschach, a masked sociopathic vigilant helmed with a black-and-white shifting mask, played exquisitely by Haley, inhibits the excellence of neo-noir tendencies with its shadowed lighting and self-important narration. Nite Owl and Silk Spectre, crime fighters surrounded in advanced technology, embed a blossoming romance amidst the jaded superhero shenanigans. Doctor Manhattan, essentially an omnipotent being, provides the melodramatic love triangle and various fantastical elements for visual grandeur, particularly when on Mars. Then there's Ozymandias, the ""world's smartest man"", whom provides duality to the story and additional moral implications. Essentially, the plot device. Individually these aesthetics work surprisingly well, especially Rorschach's, but unfortunately are obliterated by a brutally heavy-handed narrative.<br/><br/>To put it simply, the story is an abominable mess. A three-hour montage of character backstories, melodramatic reflections on society and weak acting. Let's start with the plot itself. It's an investigative murder mystery involving superheroes. One of their own, The Comedian, is brutally slaughtered. Rorschach, the only character who maintains the narrative focus, operates alone to further investigate a proposed conspiracy against the Watchmen. This all occurs within the first twenty minutes. The proceeding two hours then disregards this central, and impeccably crucial plot, to divulge in a love triangle between three other heroes that all exude the personalities of a swarm of irritating flies. Silk Spectre is moping around wanting to be genuinely loved, despite an imminent war approaching. Nite Owl wants her, and Doctor Manhattan is solemnly walking around naked on Mars constructing a glass clock thing (yeah, me neither...) because humanity offers him nothing. He doesn't see the value in human life anymore. Why? Well, humans are savage. Violence conquers all. Earth is doomed because of us. Walk through a dilapidated alleyway? Bam! Ambushed by thugs. Attempting to save innocent civilians? Bam! You're not the police. Stealing, murder and all things crime. Because, and say it with me ladies and gentlemen, humans are evil.<br/><br/>The screenplay doesn't beat around the bush, so to speak. It wants you to know how despicable this world has become and why these superheroes are so jaded. Yet it disregards the subtlety of its source material and instead beats this obvious thematic presence over your head with a nailed stick. Dreadful heavy-handed storytelling. Casual murders take place, such as Mason's, yet are instantly overlooked to implement a tediously inconsequential third act that then attempts to realign the central investigation. The individual behind the conspiracy is revealed, who then admits to everything through expositional flashbacks and has the audacity to remark ""I'm not a comic book villain"". The painful irony is extraordinary. However these climactic revelations hold zero narrative power, as the preceding two hours failed to capitalise on its murder mystery. Therefore any shocking character reveals or moral ultimatums are relinquished of impact. Akerman, Crudup and Goode were, unfortunately, weak in their designated roles. Chosen for their character resemblance rather than their dramatic prowess. And, lastly, Simon and Garfunkel's ""The Sound of Silence"" plays over a funeral procession. Just in case you forgot how bleak this alternate world was.<br/><br/>That's the type of uninspired choices implemented within Watchmen. Stylistically, it's an impressive splendour of vivid visualisation. Snyder has accumulated a signature style that undoubtedly enhances any and all atmospheric environments, including potential thermonuclear New York. Alas, it's overwhelmingly disjointed. Excruciatingly hollow. Heavy-handedly violent. Overlong. And monotonously acted. This superhero film is glazed with an audacious coat of blood, that attempts to conceal the multitude of narrative clots deep within."
"k_g_barreto","9","3","6","28 January 2020"," Great adaptation of Alan Moore's magnum opus
","3 hours and 30 minutes of pure Zack Snyder at his best is the best definition of the Ultimate Cut. I've watch the theatrical cut as well, both have its qualities, but the Ultimate Cut is really something. I've paused sometimes to check the graphic novel and Snyder really captures the tone, the world, the aspect and the messages of the original work. I liked the inclusion of the Tales of the Black Freighter, back on the movie I was thinking about the pacing, not liking it, but after seeing all the movie, the pacing here is good as well. slow-burning, almost hypnotic, I paused sometimes, wish I didn't, seeing this continuously is a experience. Here you can expect fidelity, it looks, walks and talk like the graphic novel, some changes, but I understand why they changed. Expect a great cinematography as well, the gray look of the film fits the narrative, help to create the admosphere of a world without hope, filthy and about to go to war, Zack Snyde directering is great here, he understands the visual medium, he have his own style, unique and kind of megalomaniac. The soundtrack, the edgy gore violence, distinctive action sequences, you know it's a Zack Snyder film. There's so much great things here, a few I didn't like, more subjective things than objective ones. And this film should be released later. After decades of superhero comic books, Alan Moore created THE anti-superhero comic book, which ironically is praised as the best superhero comic book ever made. If this film released with a established MCU, like in 2015 or even now, the impact of this film would be stronger, since it's a very unique comic book movie and different of all films of its kind, even with Logan and Joker out there, but you can use the argument that this film is ahead of its time, because it is."
"fernandoschiavi","9","3","6","12 September 2016"," The best adaptation of Alan Moore to another media
","It is not from today, Zack Snyder has been highlighted in the film industry. He directed the excellent ""Dawn of the Dead"" and especially praised ""300"", where Snyder can show its ability to adapt, whether in an acclaimed remake of George Romero movie, a genre master, or from iconic comic symbolizing one break from all that had been presented so far by major publishers. Watchmen is an adaptation of the eponymous comic book story written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, published by DC Comics. It was one of the first stories that also managed to attract a more adult audience, with a more serious story, that despite being set in a very fictional and futuristic environment is considered very realistic, because it deals with serious issues of the time and for a cruel narrative and without fear of censorship. The adaptation was very well received by critics and audiences and is considered by many as the best adaptation of a comic to theaters already held.<br/><br/>Like most comic book adaptations to film, Watchmen also has a long, nearly three hours, but at no time prejudice the smooth progress of adaptation due to the quality of the script that director Zack Snyder at hand, he can develop each of the characters, bringing the moral conflict in each of them and also giving importance to a reflective real political plot experienced by humanity, interspersing brilliantly past and present effectively. Written by David Hayter and Alex Tse. The latter, reconfigured earlier versions of the script already written by David Hayter, abandoning the idea of a contemporary atmosphere, entering again the cold of the original story War as the background and this was a more than right decision, not only for loyalty the HQ, but because Snyder has created an amazing solution for the opening minutes of adaptation. Of course there are holes and gaps, especially at its climax.<br/><br/>In the film, instead of acting alone, Veidt involving Dr. Manhattan in an ingenious plan to end the need for fossil fuels and thus prune the human greed that motivates wars. Veidt build a reactor that simulates the energy of Dr. Manhattan and decimating several world big cities simultaneously. Humanity is attacked by Dr. Manhattan and is united against this ""enemy"", nothing more than an unsuspecting supporting Veidt's plan. The concept was well executed, in its proposal. And here comes the greatest of all the changes: the outcome. In the graphic novel, Ozymandias dispatches one ""alien"" creature - created with the help of scientists and artists who are gone the world believing they are on the production of a major film production - playing this nuclear bomb to Times Square, causing millions of deaths, but joining the planet against an unexpected threat.<br/><br/>After showing an opening very well choreographed and full of action showing the murder of a major character, is shown presenting the opening credits to the sound of Bob Dylan - explaining the events of alternative US history from the time of history - becoming one of most celebrated sequences ever seen in cinema. Soon after, the funeral comedian is used as the main event for the meeting of superheroes, and to show a history and relationships with each other between these characters.<br/><br/>Snyder assembled a cast unknown to a certain extent, but that did not attract unnecessary attention and made the audience focus on the characters. Billy Crudup plays efficiently Dr. Manhattan, built with visual impact and emotional complexity. Only hero with special powers, even as a human, is prominent and central role in the plot. Jackie Earle Haley is the narrator and best character of the plot. The actor manages to convey the mystery tormented Rorschach. Matthew Goode, methodical Ozymandias and Carla Gugino, the first spectral (ridiculous when aged, but not enough to compromise). Jeffrey Dean Morgan, perfectly as the amoral Comedian. Patrick Wilson as the hero Nite Owl and Malin Akerman, the beautiful Silk Espectral that although heroes, crave affection, love and reason to live. The couple, in fact, carries one terrific sex scene throughout the film.<br/><br/>For the budget valued at just over US$ 100 million, the visual effects were very good employees, leaving no ill feeling finalized scenes. Already the soundtrack to Tyler Bates, added to Nat King Cole, Smashing Pumpkins, the virtuosity of Jimmy Hendrix, folk rock of Simon & Garfunkel and K.C. & The Sunshine Band guarantee the joy of the audience. The photography Larry Fong, who had previously worked with the director previously is another highlight, the gloomy weather, gloomy and mysterious present throughout the movie, create the perfect atmosphere for the type of developed story and threats presented by the script.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder delivers a film that certainly please most fans of comic books, giving the deserved importance to the work, and learned to migrate to the big screen, the tense, threatening visceral and climate, so much so, that in America the classification was severe taking into account gender due to frontal nudity scenes and sex, beginning of rape, murder pregnant, fractures, bars across parts of the body, much blood gushing. The audience who likes comics, used to the wild action and a somewhat shallow script and obvious, can surprise the lack of a greater amount of action scenes, used here with a lower budget, but who abuse creativity and competence of direction to achieve their goals. The project fully meets its goal to cause reflection, with a strong political bias and is happy to be obsessively faithful to the original material, while having the signature of its competent director. It is undoubtedly one of the best adaptations of DC Comics for audiovisual language. There is no doubt that we are on the best adaptation of Alan Moore to another media."

It wasn't till one of the greatest filmmakers of our time Christopher Nolan stepped into the genre with his Batman films that made people realize that big budget blockbusters can also be an intellectual pieces of art. This is Zack Snyder taking a shot at it.<br/><br/>The film opens up with what is one of the best opening sequences I have ever seen, setting up a mystery that the protagonist Rorschach is trying to solve. In only a couple of minutes Snyder was able to set a tone and atmosphere for this dark and bleak world with some truly awe inspiring cinematography with slow-motions, brilliant sound design and intense and violent cut-throat action. All of the above remain excellent through out the entire runtime of the film. Since then the film slows down considerably however due to its three and a half hour runtime that does not hinder the amount of action in this film. There are some truly great performances in this flick as well and the first one I have to mention is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He. Was. Phenomenal. And easily the best part about the film in a good way. You truly cared about his character. But not just him. Patrick Wilson once again proved that he is very underrated actor. He had a great chemistry with Malin Akerman who otherwise played a less likable character in Silk Spectre II<br/><br/>But really what sets this film apart from other superhero movies is the artistic neo-noir element and Snyder's signature direction. The visual storytelling in this film is truly mesmerizing. This most definitely is not your standard by the numbers superhero blockbuster, this is almost an art-house neo-noir thriller story told in a vain of an action flick. It all concludes in a perfectly fitting and disturbing ending that will keep you quiet for the rest of the evening. For this film Zack Snyder truly deserved a title of an auteur. It's easily his best work. I have yet to see a more stylish and artistic superhero film then Watchmen. Not a film for anyone, but that makes it so much better for other like me.<br/><br/>This is also my very first review that I have ever written on IMDb, as I feel not enough people have paid a proper attention to this masterpiece. This is what happens when brilliant filmmaker that is Zack Snyder isn't dictated by for money greedy studios."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","6","17 September 2014"," Who watches the Watchmen? Watchmen is an awesome movie!
","Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War, a group of mostly retired vigilantes, called the 'Watchmen', investigates an apparent conspiracy against them and uncovers something even more sinister, that come affect the outcome of the whole world. The movie is based off the Watchmen graphic novel by Alan Moore. It took a while, for a live-action film adaptation to come, due to being stranded in development hell, but I have to say, director Zack Snyder really pull it off. The film deem 'unfilmable', finally came out, with such amazing production value. The movie was just beautiful to watch. Everything pretty much work, the CGI, the visual effects, and the costumes. Glad for the fact that Snyder choice not to shoot all of the film using green screens and opted for real sets instead. You really get a sense of depth with real sets. The opening slow motion sequence to Bob Dylan ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"" was wonderful. The music choices were mostly great in the film. You really get the sense of the 1960s/1980s with the tone of the film. Even the trailer song, Smashing Pumpkins -The Beginning Is the End was delightful. Only song, I didn't like was Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'. It was a bit corny, during the love scene. The acting in the film is pretty good for the most part. Malin Åkerman as Laurie Juspeczyk AKA Silk Spectre II, Billy Crudup as Jon Osterman AKA Dr. Manhattan, Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs AKA Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Edward Blake AKA The Comedian and Patrick Wilson as Daniel Dreiberg AKA Nite Owl II were all great in their parts. Indeed, they did present six radically opposing ways to perceive the world, and to give the audience of the film, the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. It's really surprising, that this movie was even made, with a really hard R-rating, due to a lot of sex, language, and nudity. It was very faithful adaptation for the most part. Without spoiling too much, they did change one big thing toward the end, with the writers cutting out the alien invasion part and changing it to Dr. Manhattan. In my opinion, the whole Dr. Manhattan's plot works better. Glad, they didn't used the original draft by Sam Hamm features a vastly different vision than that depicted in the final film with all the assassination plots and time rifts. The pacing is a bit long, and drawn out. After all, it's came from a graphic novel with a Nonlinear narrative. So, there were a lot of flashbacks; that had little to do with the main plot, but was there for the comic fans. Alan Moore was influence by a lot of people to write, Watchmen. Alan Moore got the idea from Mighty Crusaders comic books. When he try to write for the comic book, they reject his storyline, and decide to write Watchmen, instead. William S. Burroughs as one of his main influences during the conception of Watchmen. This is where, he got the story written a story idea, and the use of symbolism. Like the book, Watchmen the film is full of them, like the stained happy face represent the Doomsday clock or the quote, 'Who watch the watchmen?"" political representing warnings to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate. It's a great time, Easter egging all of them like looking for the Nostalgia logos. I also enjoy, looking at all the familiar famous people that have cameos throughout the film like Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy, & Fidel Castro. I love the cultural references from history, slightly altered like Alfred Eisenstaedt's famous photo, Andy Warhol's factory or Studio 54. Even the flag have 51 stars, because in the film's alternate history, Vietnam became the 51st state after America won the Vietnam. This movie has a lot of replay value. Still, much of the story couldn't be fit into one movie in the normal version. Tales of the Black Freighter within the story, had to be its separate film starring Gerard Butler, and the fictional biography, 'Under the Hood', detailing the older generation of superheroes from the film's back-story had to be a DVD extra. If you love this movie, try to find the director's cut with 24 minutes of additional footage or the ultimate cut that has the director's cut of the film re-edited to contain Tales of the Black Freighter into the story as it is featured in the graphic novel, bringing the run time of the film to 215 minutes. Overall: Some people might hate the movie for its slow and nihilism tone, but it's still action packed and have some humor. For me, it was very entertaining. Worth the watch."
"hellraiser7","10","3","6","12 November 2012"," Soul of a Superhero
","Being a Superhero can be fun but the undeniable truth they all know is that their all human behind the mask. Sure I wouldn't mind being a Superhero but I can't do it 24.7 and it's not something I would want to do everyday or even forever for that matter if it interferes with my personal life too much. ""Watchmen"" is my second favorite graphic novel and I'm proud to say it's one of my favorite comic book movie adaptations and one of my personal favorite movies.<br/><br/>Watchmen was never really a superhero epic but more of a character drama which was what made it great, and it was always the humanity of a superhero that I was always interested in the most. We get to know who each of the individuals behind the masks are they all have wants, needs, flaws, fears, feelings and can age which makes them human. The Wam Bam aspect came secondary which was fine by me since sometimes but it's nature it was story filler that can bring the character drama and development to a grinding halt which annoys me in some comics. There is a who dunnit plot that intriguingly develops but the story was never entirely concerned about it.<br/><br/>Everything in this film is great and done right, from the setting they are able to successfully create the alternate America from the book which spans from 1960, 70, and 80. From the technologies which are in between modern and futuristic, what they watched, music, but also the costumes the superheroes wear. The fight sequences are great, the choreography is well done and their pretty violent; along with the special effects. It's true the film is long but the length was just right and I really didn't notice since this is one of those films your highly engrossed in that you don't care.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great characters that are all three dimensional and told in a non linear and multi focus format (similar to the TV show ""Lost"" and movie ""Pulp Fiction"").<br/><br/>Walter Kovacs/Rorshach (Jackie Earle Haley)he's my favorite character in the book and the actor not just looked like him but nailed the persona perfectly. He's sort of a more accessible Batman like character, highly intelligent, enigmatic, spooky, and might have a bit of a screw loose due to his strict black and white ethical belief that everything is arbitrary and has a pattern which probably only exists in his mind. That mask of his is one of the most impressive one's I've seen (how the heck he can see and breath in it is anyone's guess) because it's an ink blot test pattern that constantly changes. Trust me, he may'be a small guy and doesn't look like much but if any bad guy tries to pick on him he'll make them into dog meat. For example, while in prison one big guy goes at him with a knife, Rorshach just hits him with a food tray and throws deep fry grease onto him, ouch.<br/><br/>Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) he is the most complicated of them all because he's the only one that really has superpowers. It almost seems he has the good deal but sometimes with some superheroes all great power has a price. From him it was simply his human identity and mortality. His abilities have literally given him a sort of godhood, he can see multiple possibilities before they happen and has immortality. These things have made him detached from human kind to the point where his former human identity has became a distant untouchable memory. In a way his longing for mortality again is similar to Greek Myth how Gods would watch over mortals but then become mortal themselves once in a while just to get a taste what they don't/can't have or be.<br/><br/>Dan/Night Owl 2 (Patrick Wilson) is another Batman like hero from his inventiveness and all the gadgets in his underground lair. He's laid back and can live a normal life. But deep down once in a while we see he yearns to play his superhero role again because he feels his work is far from done. It sort of reflects the repressed feelings he has carried for Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre 2 (Malin Akerman) for a long time.<br/><br/>Silk Spectre 2 is a sweet, strong, slightly feisty female superhero but is a little troubled herself in figuring out who she really is and what she wants of both her identity and life.<br/><br/>Edward Blake/Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) is an anti hero that you can like or dislike (I'm more leaning toward dislike) at the same time, he is a person that has done some shady things in both personal and professional life, but we see he's a broken person from his eyes there's a sense of shame and regret.<br/><br/>Adrian Veidt/Ozymadias (Matthew Goode) is the smartest man in the world, idealistic and has literally unbeatable martial arts skills but he's a shady enigmatic characters; he's a bit cold and might have developed a bit of a god complex which makes him a bit chilling.<br/><br/>The film shows a superhero is always human, it doesn't matter what unique abilities he/she has there will always be limitations. Sure ""Spiderman"" can shoot webs and swing from point A to B, but he can't fly nor get to somebody in trouble 100 miles away. And he has to go back home and take off his mask to deal with his personal life. Even Superman after a hard day wants to go back to see Lois Lane. There is a conflicting dichotomy as we see humans wanting to be superheroes and stay super for their human lives are limiting and equally despise the role because it keeps them from being human and live life as themselves.<br/><br/>Superheroes behind the masks are made of flesh, blood and possess human souls.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"g-bodyl","9","3","6","29 October 2012"," Not Your Average Superhero Movie!
","Watchmen is definitely not the your average superhero movie you would come to expect. Zach Snyder did a very good job on changing things up and pointing out the flaws in each superhero character. Also, this movie is so much more violent than most superhero films. This film does a good job on showing the gore, blood, and sex.<br/><br/>This film is about a group of retired superheroes who reunite after a death of their own. Once reunited, they find a diabolical plan to destroy the world.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. The people who stood out to me was Malin Akerman and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as ""The Comedian."" I thought he was the best character in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a visually-striking film that is a little bit long. But this film has great action scenes and great character development. Watchmen is not your ordinary Spider-Man or Batman. I rate this film 9/10."
"giggitygiggitygoo451","8","3","6","19 July 2012"," Yes, They Are The Good Guys.
","Watchmen is big. Really big. From the time –span the story follows, to the issues it deals with, the amount of characters and the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just massive, (note that this is a review of the Director's Cut. The Theatrical Cut is a 9/10). But that's only to be expected, considering it's an adaptation of one the biggest, and one of the most critically acclaimed comic books of all time- which was one of the first to define the graphic novel genre and remains one of its great masterpieces-, so being stingy with its scale and the care taken to craft the film adaptation was never an option. Now, people will look down on me for saying this, and truth be told I do feel a twinge of guilt saying this, but I really do feel that the film lives up to it's source work, and personally, I think it surpasses it. I'm sure that's something that no fan of the graphic novel will want to hear, but I truly believe that the film takes all of its best elements and adds its own great touches, and manages to create an incredibly sharp and hugely intelligent experience.<br/><br/>This is easier said than done, which is evident from the amount of time the project spent in development Hell, waiting for someone crazy enough to make it, attracting names like Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam and others, before finally landing into the brave and talented hands of Zack Snyder, an already established pleaser of fan-boys and non-comic fans alike, with hits like 300 and Dawn of the Dead. But with Watchmen, Snyder cements himself as not only being capable of crafting a hugely faithful and worthy adaptation of an acclaimed work, but an incredibly talented and tactful director who isn't afraid to do his own thing. Big as the film is, there's not doubt its everything Hollywood hates, with a running time of over 3 hours, a slow-moving and complex plot, razor sharp satirical undertones and some extremely graphic scenes, it's frankly a miracle it was ever allowed to be made. But Snyder and his creative team, with writers David Hayter and Alex Tse and a team of producers, stuck by their guns, and have crafted a film that even Alan Moore, a notoriously harsh critic of adaptations of his work, would have to admit is pretty good.<br/><br/>The story is gigantic and spans over 40 years of history, and reaches far off to the red planet Mars, dealing with any topic, be they political, social or personal, in between. It takes place in an alternate 1985, where the world teeters on the brink of nuclear war, and where superheroes have been outlawed. When one of them is killed, Rorschach, the last hero still in operation, unknowingly stumbles on a plot that will change the entire world, leading to the re-emergence of other heroes that had previously retired, including Nite Owl, Silk Spectre and others, who must do what they can to prevent a global catastrophe in a world quickly falling apart.<br/><br/>Handling the material with great enthusiasm, and showing huge skill with the slow-moving story and character/theme driven plot, Snyder uses the aspects the graphic novel couldn't to great effect, with striking visuals and incredible colour use, breathtaking cinematography from Larry Fong and a fantastic soundtrack, (opening with one of the best montages ever made), and boasts some incredibly well-made scenes that leads to amazing story development, with not a dull moment in sight, despite an epic and sprawling plot that deals with themes like political totalitarianism, society, humanity, morality and the relevance of existence and life itself. But, believe it or not, at its heart, Watchmen is extremely satirical. True, it's a bleak, razor sharp satire, and its uncomfortable humour is mostly earned through shock value rather than broad comedy. But underneath all the heavy themes and some truly disturbing sequences, Watchmen is a sharply-observed and pitch-black comic satire that delights in deconstructing the entire superhero genre, and cast a glaring eye at what it would be like to actually be a costumed hero, asking questions like what would make real people actually become heroes, how the world would react to them, the impact they would have on society and the impact a real superhero with god-like powers would have on the world if they existed.<br/><br/>But one of the greatest strengths of Watchmen is its 3-dimensional and multi-layered characters that are thought-provoking and keenly satirical of other superhero characters, brought to life by a great cast that all really seem to understand their characters, and who succeed in nailing their performances of them to the wall. Jackie Earle Haley gives a fantastic performance as Rorschach, and depicts his unflinching brutality and expert superhero skills with his paranoid naivety brilliantly. Patrick Wilson is perfect as Dan Dreiberg, and gives a down-to-earth portrayal of a man lost in the mediocrity of normality, and together with Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter, who's Silk Spectre is spot-on and powerful, the two convey perfectly the vital theme of people who once lived lifestyles of excitement and thrills, but are now hollow shells of their former selves, desperate and driven by their need to don their costumes once again. Billy Crudup gives a perfect performance as Doctor Manhattan with his cold, calculating personality and his emotionless mind, and Matthew Goode is spot-on as the dignified yet seedy Ozymandias, but the stand-out performance for me, perhaps just for the sheer strength of his character alone, is Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian, who is so gloriously twisted and sadistic you may cringe every time he comes on-screen.<br/><br/>Watchmen is definitely not for everyone. Its 3-hour length, unusual story/themes and moments of extreme nastiness, probably means that most people won't care for it. But if you want to see a film that really puts a twist on superhero movies, then this is a film you should definitely experience."
"mjsseppl-imdb","5","3","6","30 April 2012"," The Ultimate 911
","This film is based on the American comic book characters. Comic books aren't particularly American, the special thing about American comic book characters is their nature of fighting for justice etc.<br/><br/>Hence this film is about comic book characters rescuing the world. Needless to say, although the parallels to 911 are obvious - the film does not allow itself to be critical of politics and government; it blames ""human nature"".<br/><br/>So the film ends up with that old, perennial mistake which all so-called pragmatists commit - the ends justifies the means, instead of starting as you intend to continue, or as Ghandi said, the means define the end.<br/><br/>The use of comic book super-hero characters, not surprisingly, produces very flat characters. The photography is stark, dull, dark as we know from Batman films and washed out in day time scenes. There is nothing pleasing about either.<br/><br/>The music consists of old pop songs which perversely do not fit in with the particular époque of the scene - though the songs, and their words, are interesting and sometimes fit in with the scene.<br/><br/>The film is gloomy. The subplot leading to the main plot is - who is murdering our super-hero comic book characters? - The film in untangling this subplot shows the comic characters with all their frailties.<br/><br/>Why watch the film then? Because it sets one thinking about how much we are manipulated by people claiming ideals for doing bad things, how ""ideal"" people are just plain people with their quota of desires and character flaws. The people we are referring to not being the ""baddies"", but those we are told are the ""goodies"": ""our"" side.<br/><br/>The film could have been radical in both its message, style and photography - how would Jean-Luc Godard have dealt with this theme using the comic book concept? It certainly would have been amusing. There is no humour or twinkling of the eye in this film - it is as depressing as the exploitation of 911 was. Doom and gloom."
"ashwin-aditya22","10","3","6","9 January 2012"," The killing joke
","Watchmen is one of the most enjoyable movie I have seen in a long time. Story is one of the best work of imagination known to me. Every character in watchmen is so deep and each one of them is imperfect in his own way. The character Dr Manhattan is handled perfectly by Snyder, his character is so deep and disturbed. The flow of the movie is somewhat unsatisfying but get better as the movie advances. Proper emphasis is given to each character according to their darkness and shock value in a limited amount of time permitted by a movie. Nothing in the movie stands out to be boring. I was particularly impressed by the cinematography and sound. Director Zack Snyder has done a fantastic job with the movie and I will be waiting eagerly for his upcoming movies. Overall a treat for those who love very dark and intense movies."

","In an alternate 1985 where former superheroes exist, the murder of a colleague sends active vigilante Rorschach into his own sprawling investigation, uncovering something that could completely change the course of history as we know it.<br/><br/>In 1986, the greatest graphic novel had arisen. The themes, the premise, and everything in between had me adapted to both the story and the insides. So much, in fact, that I read it twice more and fell in love with how much of a masterpiece it was. After that, a movie was announced. Many became skeptical because we all know movie adaptations become horrible, and with something as huge as Watchmen, no one could release something holding everything in. Zach Snyder signed on and fully researched the novel. His stylized directing might make a few raise an eyebrow but his research and love for the novel held some momentum. In 2009, the film was released. I sat down with huge expectations, people around me; the same. From the beautiful death of the Comedian to the highly-constructed main titles, my expectations grew higher. I thought the cast gave something in and the overall aspects would raise it even higher. The film moved on and finished with a run time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. I was shocked. Basically every one of Alan's ideas were projected onto the big screen. Not only, Zach's understanding and style brought more into the project. Everything was impressive, from the acting to the special effects. Watchmen brought my expectations and threw them out and created a bigger, badder one... The acting was overall great, I thought so no cheesiness and stupidity, so everything was fine and dandy there. The special effects, thanks to Zach, gave more and more to the movie and put it up there with the best. The style was overall dark and gritty. The symbolism and premise gave the movie some sort of flair, bringing in new ideas right around the corner. Everything was satisfactory and I have only few complaints. The main people who bash on it only do so because they aren't fans of the novel. If they only understood the meaning and depth and just Dr. Manhattan's penis, maybe they would come to an understanding that Zach and the crew finally gave us the movie we have all been wanting... Then we have the ending. The novel's ending was strong and powerful, and Zach had the idea to ditch it and give us something new; something in his terms ""better."" From the news of this change, obviously fans would bash on the idea. I, for one, found the idea intriguing and this did not factorize my watching. The ending worked in my opinion, but for Zach's understanding of the fan's reactions, he shouldn't have done it. But nevertheless, the ending was new and did it's job, but surely couldn't match up to the power of the novel's. Despite the film's minor flaws and despite the films ending change, Zach did a courageous job. If only people could respect his vision and understand what it is, this could've had better reviews overall. This film has become one my favorites, with it's adaption and power: it sets itself well. I was overall impressed on everything done and the score gave the film some mystifying power. This film surely shouldn't be missed, and I recommend it to the fans and walkabouts. Who Watches The Watchmen? We all do. 10/10."
"nbwritersinbox","8","3","6","19 October 2011"," New Direction For An Aging Genre!
","Bland this film ain't! The tired and bloated ""superhero"" genre is turned inside out, while over a thousand reviews indicate this movie got us all thinking. (A rare accolade for movies in these de-intellectualized times).<br/><br/>But, sorry, nil points to the Hollywood Studios for not awarding Alan Moore a writing credit... Poor form. His literary genius made ""Watchmen"" possible.<br/><br/>Okay: the movie. Well, this isn't family entertainment. It's disturbing in parts, often violent, even brutal. Watchmen takes us to dark parts of the human psyche, then stands back with us amid the chaos as if to say: Judge for yourself! An extraordinary performance by Jackie Earle Haley (as Rorschach) made for compelling viewing. Smooth, seamless direction by Synder delivers absorbing cinema, despite a 2 hour journey. It's unlikely you'll check your watch.<br/><br/>I can see why reviewers mention Watchmen and Bladerunner in the same breath. A few stock characters (""Nite Owl"" is a little too much like Superman, lets face it) and a few all-too-familiar fight sequences in alley and prison yard mean I cannot attribute ""masterpiece"" to this brave, mainstream offering. Bladerunner remains more original.<br/><br/>It's a good film, working hard to take a bland genre in a new direction. Just don't let the kids watch it until they're at college! Favorite Quote: Nite Owl: ""Adrian wouldn't kill anyone, he's even a vegetarian.."" Rorschach: ""So was Hitler. You're squeamish. Leave him to me."""
"LloydBayer","8","3","6","11 July 2011"," Well crafted. Zack Snyder at his best.
","In a nutshell, my review for this move boils down to three words- Clever, complex and complete. Fresh on the heels of his unexpected smash hit ""300"", director Zack Snyder outdoes himself with this comic book adaptation. Unfortunately for Snyder, Christopher Nolan had the upper-hand with 2009's box-office bomb, ""The Dark Knight"". Even so, Snyder's work here is a painstaking and well crafted movie that is targeted at a mature audience.<br/><br/>The story is adapted from Alan Moore's independent comic book by the same name with acquisition by DC Comics for a full blown screenplay. Through the opening credits, we are introduced to caped vigilantes of the 1930s and 1940s. Calling themselves the Watchmen, most of them are now retired after having helped the US government through the Vietnam War and averting the Cuban Missile Crises. Hmmm, so this is where X Men: First Class got its inspiration. After the John F Kennedy assassination and ensuing public outcry, the Watchmen are now disbanded and living on their own. With each receiving proper introductions and ample screen time, they are Edward Blake AKA the Comedian, Walter Kovacks AKA Rorschach, Daniel Dreiberg AKA Nite Owl, Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, Laurie Jupiter AKA Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, the only former member with immense superpowers. Following the murder of the Comedian, Rorschach gets in touch with Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan (now living with Silk Spectre II) and Ozymandias trying to warn each that former members of the Watchmen are being assassinated. With ties to the government and having put so many criminals behind bars, it is easy to see why anyone would want them dead. While Rorschach and Nite Owl investigate the Comedian's death, Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre realizes problem with their relationship with Manhattan distancing himself from humanity. In the meanwhile, the doomsday clock is ticking with the world bracing for nuclear war between the United States and the Soviets. But with the Watchmen retired, unwanted and stalked by a mysterious assassin, who will now save the world from total annihilation?<br/><br/>Set in 1985 with Richard Nixon running his third term as president of the United States, this film is a clever analogy to the cold war crises of the mid 1980s. The essence of the plot is seamlessly grafting historical events with fiction, resulting in a very plausible story. Once again, kudos to Snyder for breaking out a movie other directors and producers have tried and abandoned since 1986. Their failure can be vindicated by the fact that the story itself is intricate enough to adapt on screen. Then there is mandatory character development, alternate history, and the current film making technology that was lacking 25 years ago. Although this film offers ample doses of high-end visual effects and CGI, the main focus is on character development, making this a true character driven film. As such, acting is flawless from a star studded lineup. Most notable are Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Malin Ậkerman as Silk Spectre II and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Dr. Manhattan is entirely CGI rendered but voiced by Billy Crudup. Special mention also goes to Robert Wisden as Richard Nixon and Carla Gugino as Silk Pectre.<br/><br/>All aspects considered, Snyder has truly cut a niche out for himself. But as I mentioned before, this film was overshadowed by ""The Dark knight"" because Watchmen is not intended for a teenage audience and is not your run-of-the-mill superhero caper. Yes, the story is engaging from start to finish, but it's the detail that has gone into the production. Cinematography is top notch and Snyder's frequent use of overhead angles of filming adds an extra touch to the look and feel. There is also something unique about combining slow-motion in heavy rain, and this is complemented by an excellent score. The soundtrack on the other hand takes you back to the 70s and 80s and is a perfect choice for the setting. However, be warned that violence is extreme and brutal. Like ""300"", Snyder is unforgiving with blood, gore and guts.<br/><br/>What is stopping me from rating this film with 5 stars is the unnecessary inclusion of over 20 minutes of animation, which I find has no relation to the already complex plot. Then again, my review is based on the ""director's ultimate cut"" available only on Blu-ray Disk. Had I watched the DVD version containing the ""Director's cut"", I would have rated this film with every star it deserves. I also thought the ending was a bit disappointing in comparison to the rest of the story. But overlooking this inclusion, watching this movie is an event in itself, not because of the two and half hour of engagement time, but due to its epic scale in storytelling. For a truly uninterrupted viewing experience, turn your phones silent and watch this in one sitting.<br/><br/>As a Zach Snyder fan, I eagerly await his next release in re-booting the Superman saga. After what he did for this film, it is just a matter of time before Snyder grabs the whole superhero genre by the horns. For what it's worth, ""Man of Steel"" is rumored to have both Snyder and Nolan working together. Will wonders never cease!"
"damoskees","9","3","6","25 June 2011"," A Great movie
","I watched this film for the first time without any idea of the plot, or expectations. I was blown away.<br/><br/>There has apparently been some controversy about the grittiness of Watchnmen, portraying heroes capable of more cruelty and injustice than the worst antiheroes in cinema.<br/><br/>However, it takes a brave, and more to the point, incredibly capable director to be able to make an uncompromising and refreshingly different film that is nonetheless big-budget and mainstream, and Zack Snyder proves in Watchmen that he is such a director.<br/><br/>This is not a film to put on the TV while flicking through Facebook or doing odd jobs; it's definitely one to sit down, darken the room, put on the surround sound and absorb every detail, every nuance, every plot point. Because it's excellent."
"Mrohnoes","6","3","6","17 May 2011"," Big Bore-fest of a Movie
","I love to see movies based off comics, because I know there will be lots of action to keep you watching and entertained. However, this movie decided to screw the audience and bore them to death. It is likely the most boring movie I've ever seen. ""Oh what do you know? You've never read any of the Watchmen comics!"", you say. That's only half true. Prior to seeing the movie, I had yet to read the comic. However, a few months back, I found the comics and read them, and I must say, I was quite impressed with them. The movie is very faithful to the comics, in that they both have massive amounts of dialogue. In a comic, that's fine, as we are reading the words to get what's happening. The problem is when you adapt that to film, all that dialogue, with little action in between, will bore your audience. The only good parts of the movie were the action scenes, what few there were. If you want to get your fill of Watchmen, go find the comics and stay away from the movie."

","First thing i would like to do is tip my hat off to Zack Snyder, what he has created is a fine example of great adaptation. He has adapted the greatest graphic novel into a gritty, mesmerizing and thought inducing movie. His directing really shines in this movie along with several other key components.<br/><br/>Acting: Almost every actor plays their roles very well and spot on. Patrick Wilson, Matthew Goode, Jeffrey Dean Morgan play their roles extremely well, Jeffrey Dean Morgan mixed his acting between the funny Comedian and the kickass one. The one actor that really shines in this movie is Jackie Earle Haley, who gives a amazing performance as Rorschach. Not only does Jackie provide a intimidating voice under the Rorschach mask, but acts on an Oscar nominee scale when the masks comes off. As for Malin Akerman, eh, its so and so, she delivers her lines and gives a good crying scene at the end but its average. At the bottom of the acting spectrum IMO is Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan. His role as the Doctor was awkward as best on the first viewing. His voice did not match with the large muscular build of Manhattan and all of the Doctors were flat so there goes any emotion, but he gave really good body language through out the film.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot starts out cliché, superhero is killed by shadowy figure, ally tries to figure out what happened, only to discover a large conspiracy on a grander scale. Small clues lead to larger clues and the conspiracy starts to unravel. But the plot then takes a 180 when the conspiracy involves the deathly powers of Dr. Manhattan, the betrayal of one of the heroes and the deaths of millions of people. This ending is not one of those ""every lives happily ever after"", its one of those ""those that were not killed by the nuclear explosion lives happily ever after"". It is a shock to see a SuperHero movie end on such a dark note but this is a graphic novel adaptation rated R movie. However, you must take note of this, this movie requires multiple viewings in order to catch every thing (two if your really sharp, 3 or more if your less sharp). You may not like the plot the first time around, but after several viewings, the movie will start to grow on you (just like it did myself and my bro). <br/><br/>Overall: A very gritty super hero movie with an above average plot. The fighting in this movie is spread out but when it hits the screen, it leaves a lot of blood, broken bones and guts in your faces. But i implore you to view this movie multiple times, it will get better with every viewing. For myself, it was a 6 out 10 on the 1st viewing, 8 out of 10 on the 2nd, and 9 out of 10 the rest of the way through. If you want a hardcore super hero that shows no mercy to the criminals, this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>P.S. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. I cannot express this enough, i do not want some parent throw this movie away because of their kids was scarred by a crooks arm being broken graphically. This movie is a graphic novel adapted Rated R movie. Their are multiple sex scenes in this movie (including a rape scene). Dr. Manhattan is completely naked with his Johnson hanging out for everyone to see half of his screen time. And there even a scene in which a man has his arms cut off with a metal saw (VERY GRAPHIC). So this is just a warning, don't let your little ones watch this. 17+ people only, unless you're more lenient on your kids, then go right ahead but nothing lower then 14 years. I say this because one of my dads friends took his 8 year old daughter to it and had to walk out of the theaters because of the violence."

","This is a review on Zack Snyder's Director's Cut of Watchmen.<br/><br/>So many things you can say about this but you wouldn't be able to fit it all in the one review. Adapted from Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' highly influential comic book of the same name, director Zack Snyder attempts to bring Watchmen to another medium: film. And what an outstanding film it is. Running just over 3 hours, the film will never bore. Your eyes will be glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Containing just incredible performances from nearly every cast member, the standouts are Jackie Earle Haley as Rorshach and Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan. Jackie is pure method when it comes to acting and is instantly unrecognisable as the vigilante. The way he moves, his deep and intimidating voice, his very disturbing back story: everything is perfect. Probably the best casting choice since Naomi Watts in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. Billy Crudup, despite being totally redone in amazing GG, is brilliant as Dr Manhattan. Crudup's hypnotic and enchanting voice is the only reason I love his performance. Every time he's on screen, his voice just enhances the viewing experience. I could listen to him all day.<br/><br/>Snyder and his team have put a ton of effort into re-creating Moore's gritty vision of 1985 New York. The set design is sublime and gorgeous. But it's the films visual look that makes the film even more special. Snyder is known for his highly visual films and Watchmen is no different. Every scene is carefully and skillfully done to create a sense of atmosphere and a stunning look. Such scenes like Rorshach's back story and Dr Manhattan's back story and The Comedian's funeral come to mind.<br/><br/>I remember one reviewer saying, about Watchmen, that Zack Snyder is ""the Stanley Kubrick of comic book adaptations"". I think I will agree with this. So many images stay with you long after viewing. Snyder's style is very much like Kubrick's. Incredible set design, lovely long takes and an atmosphere like no others. So don't expect a run-of-the-mill comic book film. This is serious science fiction and a complex yet interesting look at humanity and what makes us human.<br/><br/>Watchmen is truly special. An intelligent look at heroes, a highly interesting study of humanity and life and a visually stunning film that is one of the very best of the decade. A masterpiece that will hopefully get recognised more in the future. It is important science fiction that should lie with Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey and Mamoru Oshii's 'Ghost In The Shell' as serious works of art to be studied. If not, humanity may fail."
"oneguyrambling","5","3","6","5 November 2010"," A flashy film about a very un-super bunch of supers.
","Watchmen starts with the death of the Comedian, named because, because, because damned if I know - he isn't funny in any case.<br/><br/>The opening credits go for many minutes, I mention this mainly as the movie over three hours long and at times draaaaags. The credits show an alternate version of the 80s with the Watchmen and their background integrated, they are pretty clever and if you pay attention help a little with what follows.<br/><br/>The only active Watchmen (Watchman?) is Rorschach, the rest were forced out by President (in this reality) Nixon. Rorschach believes that the Comedian was targeted for death - and that the other Watchmen are all next - he goes to tell the rest of the group.<br/><br/>Over the next 30 minutes we meet some of the ex-Watchmen, find out that their roles were passed on by others and originated when police decided to go undercover to deal with certain criminals that hid their identities to avoid justice. Some Watchmen are keeping a low profile and their secret identities secret and others are out in the open.<br/><br/>We also find that there is a pending nuclear crisis as the USA and Russia are still not pals, and we learn that looking at our watch will become a common event until the credits roll.<br/><br/>One hour and 7 minutes in (yes I looked) we get our first cool scene. Nightowl and Silk Spectre, well their alter-egos anyway, are set on by a gang of thugs in the type of alley that only exists in comic books and movies, and they systematically kick the snot out of all the bad guys in pretty violent fashion.<br/><br/>Then after we have the cool scene, back to the rest of the movie. Watchmen goes like this Not much happens minor plot advancement backstory not much happens minor plot advancement backstory etc. For 2 and a half hours! Now in saying that the backstories are partially interesting and actually include most of the violence and disturbing events and imagery. And I mean disturbing, there are child murderers, rape and a pregnant woman is murdered on screen. None of this really advances the main plot though which is why it is so annoying.<br/><br/>The plot for the actual events in the film sucks.<br/><br/>Let me point something out, in the entire film not one superhero apart from one, uses their special power to achieve anything out of the ordinary. Read that again, no Spidey-sense, no Hulk-Smash, no Bat-cape, not even any Speedy Gonzales-hotfeet.<br/><br/>I'll leave my main gripe until the end of this review, but the above paragraph runs a very, very close second. When you have a poster/DVD cover with a bunch of superheroes, and 80% of the film has them doing anything but superheroing, it feels a lot like false advertising And it feels dull. Especially a 20 minute scene set on Mars, 20 of the dullest and unnecessary minutes in modern cinema.<br/><br/>Other noteworthy moments include a fanboy sex scene - in full superhero outfits no less, a jail break fight with much hair flying and choreographed slo mo ""action"" and a supercomputer holding the secret plot that is hacked into with 4 password tries.<br/><br/>This film would have been better served had it been edited down to a 100 minutes, even 2 hours. As it stands it would be more accurately named Dull and Duller. There is even an in-joke where a superhero says ""I'm not a comic-book villain!"" Cue 100 nerds chuckling ""Yes you are"" under their breath. _______________________________________ My main whinge.<br/><br/>I have deliberately ignored outlining the various superheroes as they are largely the same, people who punch bad guys, the only difference being their name and outfit.<br/><br/>I saw this in the cinema and went away disappointed, and it was only when asked why I wasn't a big fan that I thought it through and realised that a superhero movie is often only as good as the superhero in it.<br/><br/>Watchmen came with a massive buzz, but mainly because the industry needs something to hype each year, so seldom does the film live up to the hype, (The Dark Knight is a notable example).<br/><br/>This is no The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5 / 10. A group of boring middling superheroes doing largely nothing doesn't add up to a great movie.

"Targe","10","3","6","16 August 2010"," The apex movie of dark superheroes
","I remember reading this graphic novel in high school, and was very excited about this movie. It did not disappoint.<br/><br/>In a refreshing trend began by perhaps Peter Jackson and his Lord of the Rings movies, tributes to past work of authors is being treated to something rare - directors who do not compromise, who present the work as written, who if anything give vibrant life to the brilliant work already done by the author. This is Watchmen.<br/><br/>If the author is too dark, too gritty, then so goes the movie. You are treated to dark alter-heroes who you are not sure if you love or hate. In the case of the Comedian, I love him and hate him all at the same time. You are treated to the dirty naughty sexy trashy world of the pubescent young boy's fantasy supergirl, a world I relish in and still insist on to this day, and you are entertained.<br/><br/>If the author put in ridiculous costumes and far fetched pets and tepid homosexual unlovable anti-heroes, then so goes the movie. He kept everything, and I salute him.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a dark mirror on your society, and the evil of super hero worship, and the fallacy of fighting crime with violence. It is an exploration of the lurid sexuality in comic book heroines, and the horror and futility of war. All of this is capped with a top shelf music score and special effects visuals that blow it out of the water.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies, a brilliant masterpiece of film that I treasure.<br/><br/>Hello darkness my old friend, it's good to talk to you again..."
"dcw-12","5","3","6","22 January 2010"," This fan boy must admit this film didn't work
","The first time I saw this movie I was just happy to see this graphic novel brought to life. I enjoyed the whole film because of this. I got a lot of pleasure out of all the little details in the film. There was a lot of criticism of the film right from the start and as a fan boy I was insulted by this.<br/><br/>However after seeing the film a number of times I am forced to agree with the criticism. The film as it stands now is a giant mess. The pacing is all wrong. The kind of drawn out exposition that can work in a graphic novel just doesn't work here despite the actors best efforts. The story is confusing to people who aren't familiar with the graphic novel. <br/><br/>The story is disjointed. It ranges from completely manic to gratingly slow. Some of the key points in the film are exposed in a few frames while unimportant scenes of padding drag out forever.<br/><br/>Alan Moore, the writer of the graphic novel, didn't give his approval to the adaptation because he said it was impossible to adapt. He had tried for years to do it adequately. To me that was Alan's silent seal of approval for the Director to hack and slash the original story to make it work for the screen. Yes you would have endured the wrath of fan boys but the film could have been something special. Instead the director and screen writer decided to double down on a failed concept: forcing the graphic novel even more directly straight onto film. Alan Moore told you this was impossible Zack perhaps next time you will listen to advice?<br/><br/>The failure of the overall film shows that Alan Moore was right. Many of the effects/action sequences are quite a bit of fun. Many of the intellectual points and ideas in the film are compelling individually. <br/><br/>However taken as a whole the thing fails miserably. <br/><br/>Its really a shame because the concepts in this film are incredibly relevant to today's world. The idea of unlimited resources and how today's greedy society is probably striving to wipe out the concept. That is interesting. Many of the fight sequences are downright cool and convey the brutality of violence really well.<br/><br/>The idea of Atomic power being personified in superhero form is pretty awesome. <br/><br/>However as soon as you encounter a scene that works. Along comes a scene that falls flat, feels forced, or is unnecessary to ruin the party. This ultimately makes the film more taxing than enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Bummer."

","Whats the movie about? Its true I had never heard of Watchmen or the graphic novel until I saw the movie, but tired hard to really get into the plot. It remained largely inscrutable and the movie is perhaps targeted at fans of the comic book or graphic novel. The characters are developed in a one dimensional fashion, and while I sat through the 165 minutes, by the end of the movie, I still couldn't care less about any of the characters. The plot is so choppy, and with so many random turns, that any semblance of a storyline is completely obfuscated. The relationship between the older Miss Jupiter and the Comedian is seemingly a key part of the plot but just seems illogical and out of place. How does this movie get such a high rating?"
"oconnelln","9","3","6","12 August 2009"," Violence, blood, nudity and sex I highly recommend this movie
","I had not heard much about this film or known of the comic book that well. I was however a big Synder fan after the awesome 300 and once i saw the excellent trailer i had to check this out. I went with absolutely no expectations but was completely blown away. I came out of cinema and remember been a bit shocked and after a few hours it hit me what an excellent movie i had just seen.<br/><br/>The movie is visually striking with an intense story that revolves around really dysfunctional but interesting superheroes.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was very good. These actors did such a surprising job playing their characters, and taking them seriously. The dialogue for the film is right out of the graphic novel and you would think it would be unnatural for people to talk the way the characters do in the comic. But it doesn't come off unnatural at all. These actors really became these characters and the performance that blew me away was that of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. I know he has a mask on the majority of the time, but the intensity and emotions are heavy and strong and his growling voice is perfect.<br/><br/>The action in the film was excellent, the fight scenes were choreographed extremely well and brutal as hell. You know exactly what you have in store for the film when the Comedian gets his ass kicked in the opening scene.The music and sound effects for the film were perfect.The soundtrack is great, and all the songs they chose to put in the movie were just right.(sex scene aside that is) The film is long but flows nicely and keeps you gripped from start to finish.Like 300 it is visually amazing with slick style which firmly puts Snyder as a new generation director. Regardless of who you are if you can handle crazy mature content such as violence, blood, nudity and sex I highly recommend this movie."

","Comic books had their heyday from the Great Depression through the fifties. Although they are not as popular now as they were at the time, they still have their devoted fans (the tide does appear to be changing with the rising popularity of Japanese animation, or manga). ""Watchmen"" is considered the greatest graphic novel of all time (and TIME magazine listed it as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century). Having read it (but not being a comic book fan myself), I can say that Alan Moore's graphic novel is very good, but most of its accolades are unwarranted. Many of the themes present have been told before, and seem rather tired (that being said, I read it about a quarter of a century after its initial publication, so maybe time simply hasn't been good to it).<br/><br/>That being said, Zack Snyder's film version is not only excellent, but in my opinion, it's better than the source material. The graphic novel was dense and at times highly confusing, forcing me to go back and revisit past parts of the story. The film version is more streamlined, and less padded, without losing any of the book's impact or intelligence. I don't understand why the audience reaction was so polarized. Of course there are the hard-core fans, who think any film version will be a butchery of their Holy Bible (past attempts at filming hit books have proved them right for the most part). Then there's the writer, Alan Moore, who refused to have his name listed as the author of the book, but he's done that ever since ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" came out (an over-reaction in my book. While ""LXG"" was no ""The Dark Knight,"" it's entertaining to watch when it's on TV).<br/><br/>Speaking of ""The Dark Knight,"" that's probably the film to compare ""Watchmen"" to. This is no ""Spider-Man."" ""Watchmen"" is a dark, violent and menacing world. The R-rating is warranted (for once). Not only does it contain some gory violence (though not as much as the MPAA would lead you to believe), it contains the first sex scene on film in years.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" takes place in an alternate reality. It's 1985, and Nixon is still the President (Watergate is never addressed). In the past, men and women dressed up in costumes with the requisite gadgets and fought crime, or committed it. But legal action has made crime-fighting superheroes a thing of the past, so all the ex-heroes can do is go about their days like everyone else and reminisce about the past. However, for a group of superheroes who called themselves the ""Watchmen,"" a new threat has surfaced. One of their crew was murdered, and the threat of a ""mask killer"" puts them all in danger.<br/><br/>The most apparent change is most of the material regarding the first band of ""Watchmen"" has been eliminated. In my opinion, this was a good move, since that stuff made the story more convoluted than necessary, and never really added anything anyway. Most of the material remains, however, and I swear some of the dialogue has been lifted directly from the novel itself. That's good, because some of the dialogue is brilliant (and not just the catchphrases).<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly good. Malin Ackerman is solid as Silk Spectre II. She's an ordinary girl with an extraordinary past. Patrick Wilson is a big surprise as Nite Owl II. He's an effective lead, despite having a past of flat performances (he has some bland moments here, too, but overall his low-key portrayal works). Matthew Goode is rather flat as Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, although the script's version of the character didn't come out very well. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is good as the gruff Comedian. He's dark and vicious, but The Comedian was never a well-developed character to begin with, and that hasn't changed here. Jackie Earl Haley is excellent as Rorschach, the dangerous psychopath who took the vigilante part of being a superhero to heart. However, the biggest surprise is Billy Crudup. Save for a few feature film appearances, Crudup has laid low with his career, but his Dr. Manhattan gives him a chance to display his true talent. Of all the Watchmen, Dr. Manhattan is truly the most dynamic. He has the traditional superhero origins (a scientific experiment gone awry), but Moore opted for something far less conventional. Crudup (and Snyder) respect that. Dr. Manhattan has become superhuman, and in so doing, he becomes alienated from humanity. This, and the resulting toll it has on his relationships, is perfectly portrayed by Crudup.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder got the public's attention with his re-envisioning of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" but he REALLY burst onto the scene with his stunning and visually arresting version of ""300."" Snyder clearly has a sense of visual flair. It suits him well for ""Watchmen,"" but Moore's comic has a more complex story, and to bring a competent version of the novel to the screen, a director has to have a good sense of how to tell a story. Snyder has it, and that's what makes this film so good. There are times where he borders on overuse with the camera tricks, but it's not excessive. But Snyder can tell a story in a way that is clear and concise, but also involving.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" isn't flawless, but it's one of the best superhero movies ever to come out in a while."
"abenglish-1","Null","3","6","23 April 2009"," Great film!
","I'm a critique of depressing drama by trade... As a child I was fascinated by even the mediocre horror and Sci-fi. Science Fiction filmography has very an infrequent base of release that can be categorized in the top shelf of movie goers ""award winning"" regime. It's often unfair that we exclude such extraordinary film work of various types from Oscar ""best film"" and associated applause. Especially in more recent years, this genre of film has seen tremendous effort and excellence. Anyway... to be blunt,... this film is landmark. To consider how difficult it would be to follow such a great graphic novel is certainly mind-boggling. The DVD graphic novel rendition is very good, and even though the narration lacks differentiation between character narration or gender it is very good. Hence, a hard act to follow. The movie adaptation is eerie and you catch things verbatim from the illustrated version of caption bubbles. Even certain background items leap from cartoon to film, it's SO damned good. Unfortunately for those people hell bent on absolute rendition of graphic novel to movie adaptation they might be disappointed. There are slights to the story to make the movie adaptation more pleasing, believable, etc,... Certainly the cartoon of a grotesque alien is difficult to adapt so the film does a certain makeover to the plot and does it exceptionally well IMHO. This film will stand the test of time. In the ranks of other Sci_Fi films like Bladerunner, Forbidden Planet, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001 A Space Odyssey, etc,... This film distorts the time table and allows the viewer to molt with a wide range of futuristic yet retrospective mind bend. In as much as I wanted to criticize, characters in this movie like Rorschach are simply so incredible and well acted that it would leave you breathless. As the statement goes... ""I'm not in here with you,... you're in here with me!""... And so the story goes. Highly recommended."

So please accept that your own personal view might differ from mine, but i hope this review might help you if you haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>Having found the Graphic Novel just 2 years ago, I've read literature for years, everything from Stephen King, Brett Easton Ellis to Chuck Palahniuk. So i know what a great work of art is, and when i'd read the final page on the GN, i was in love. Well, not really, but almost. So you can imagine the horror when I first heard there was coming a movie, but as time passed by I actually came to look forward to it, and as the months passed to weeks passed to days, I was barely alive. I needed my fix. I needed something that was Watchmen, but yet new. And thats exactly what i got. 2 hours and 42 minutes of pure Watchmen. Sure, they changed somethings, others were miscast, but hey, nothings perfect.<br/><br/>I've heard people calling this movie dull and that it was slow paced etc etc, and i can understand why people feel this way, i mean, it's long, and sometimes nothing happens for long. But for me, during that ""slow"" time in the movie, there was so much detail to look at, that i didn't care, i wanted it to be longer (so guess what, I'm REALLY looking forward to the DVD)<br/><br/>To summon things up. Watchmen is homage to the Graphic Novel, sure it has some flaws, but i still give it a 10/10. The movie has every intent to get people to read the GN.

"Mike_Offerosky","9","3","6","23 March 2009"," Watching The Watchmen
","Watchmen is a rare film and because of that it may scare off some looking for the usual superhero fare. Watchmen packs in a lot in its two hours and forty minutes so it never feels too long or boring. The film is densely plotted and original. Give director Zak Snyder (300, the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead) credit for turning Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel into a film; the project had been long gestating since the late 80's. Terry Gilliam was set to direct at one point but ultimately deemed it to be ""unfilmable"".<br/><br/>According to many Snyder's vision of Watchmen is faithful. Not having read the novel I have to believe they are probably right. Snyder did not seem to want to compromise the integrity of the project. At one point, the studio was in talks with Snyder to make it PG-13 but ultimately Snyder decided it wasn't going to work. Snyder has also said that he is going to add an hour for the DVD and Blu-ray version of the release.<br/><br/>Now on to the film itself, The Watchmen meets and exceeds expectations. The film is set in an alternate reality of the US in 1985. Nixon just won his 5th term in office and the US is in a cold war with Russia and nuclear war is all but on the brink. Masked vigilantes have been part of the culture since the 40's the first group was called the Minutemen and we get a brief synopsis of what happened to them. The latest group are The Watchmen. Some of the Watchmen don't don their masks and fight crime anymore as superheroes are now made illegal. Some decide that its still their obligation. Did I mention someone is trying to kill off superheroes? This brings the group back together. The movie has a lot going on including a very involved mythology which is very engrossing. The film is very satisfying and will leave you discussing and thinking about the film for a long while. Very highly recommended."

It is an action movie, but it's also a drama. The plot is deep, complex, and gripping.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that Watchmen is one of my favourite films and I urge many people to go see it."
"The_Messenjah200","10","3","6","23 March 2009"," A superhero soap opera well deserving of its hype
","Hype can be a powerful thing. It can propel a movie to greatness and expose it to a larger audience (See also: Fight Club), or it can cause viewers to expect far too much and then become inevitably disappointed with the movie's inability to live up to the word on the street. Such was the case with 2008's summer blockbuster/alleged masterpiece of modern cinema, The Dark Knight. While Watchmen may be compared to The Dark Knight due to both films dealing with costumed vigilantes fabricated by the DC Comics company, the comparisons end there. Watchmen is far more deserving of its hype. This film is in no way an average ordinary superhero movie. (And yes, I did just make a Smash Mouth reference, thanks.) Watchmen is set is a decaying alternate reality of 1985 New York City. In the film, Richard Nixon has been elected for a third term (this takes the setting from ""dystopian"" to ""Post Apocalyptic"") and because of this the US and the USSR are incredibly close to destroying each other with all out nuclear war. Meanwhile, the murder of a friend causes a dysfunctional group of retired superheroes, The Watchmen to slowly come out of retirement for an investigation. These two plot points mesh to form a highly interesting, gripping story with good pacing.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is the characterization. Each member of the Watchmen has an interesting and unique back story. None of the characters are without flaws either, which makes them all the more interesting to watch and learn about. Among the most interesting characters are Rorschach, a sociopathic man who narrates the film through his diary composed of misanthropic, cynical commentary on life in The Big Apple; Dr. Manhattan, a Blue-Man Group reject / nudist who takes out his frustration at rejection by accidentally gaining godlike powers in freak physics accident and as such has lost touch with humanity; and The Comedian a ""hero"" with highly questionable morals. A back story is told via flashback for each character that provides clues as to their motives.<br/><br/>The directing was also very well done. I personally do not find Zack Snyder to be a great director and find his style to be aptly described with the phrase ""all fluff and little substance"", but Watchmen proves this wrong. Indeed, this film has far more substance than the average movie. This is due to the multilayered story presented in the comic (excuse me, I mean ""Graphic Novel"") that provides source material. The film explores themes of morality being relative as well as the power of the media. Nothing in this movie happens like you'd expect it to in a traditional superhero film.<br/><br/>However, this isn't to say the film is without its flaws. Some of the story is hard to follow at certain points, particularly the main conflict that leads to the final showdown of the film. This seems highly rushed and almost tacked on. Nothing truly indicates the twist and there is little foreshadowing. Another thing, like any action movie in this post-Matrix world, Watchmen utilizes slow motion far more than is necessary. This could be a lot worse, however. I mean, come on, we're talking about the director of 300 here. Finally, the large length of the film may bore some of the more ADD afflicted members of the internet generation, but the length could please viewers who like films with a lot of aspects.<br/><br/>The film also contains graphic violence and large quantities of sex and nudity that probably shouldn't be viewed by younger audiences. Watchmen is very much a superhero soap opera designed for adults and mature teenagers. Do not imagine it to be as clean as the Spiderman movies. Take your kids to see The Incredibles or something, they probably won't know the difference. Regardless, this film is highly recommended. You should go watch the Watchmen."
"rbpjsg","4","3","6","22 March 2009"," Misleading Preview
","Personally, I didn't like the movie much (although I wouldn't say it's the worst movie of all time) and I did go into it expecting an action movie because of the previews (my mistake). I've never read the comic book so I didn't know I was headed into a movie more centered on human nature than on superheroes.<br/><br/>I like complex characters, although I'm more a fan of reading about then in books than in movies, and there's a chance I might like this movie more if I saw it a second time around; the first time around I was too busy trying to figure out who was who and how they were all connected to each other. However I don't think I will be seeing it again because of all the violence. I'll be the first to admit, I'm rather squeamish and the blood didn't bode well for the state of my stomach. I left the movie feeling rather sick.<br/><br/>It also seemed to me that the time spent on sex scenes could have been spent more on the connections between the different characters. I felt like I needed a road map to figure out who was on which team at what time and what they did, what their superhero name was, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this film could be pretty good for some viewers but I don't think I personally should have gone to see it. I think the preview was misleading and that's probably gotten a lot of people angry who didn't read the comic book, and I think they have a right to be. I don't however thing it was a downright terrible film, just, I don't know, mislabeled maybe would be the right idea to put to it. <br/><br/>To cut to the chase, this isn't a good movie if you're in the mood for action. It is a good movie if you want something thought provoking and don't mind a fair amount of male nudity and quite a lot of blood."

","I went to see the movie this weekend and must admit I ended up almost hating it (yes, I've read the book... several times even). The main cause for me not liking the movie at all, is because almost every message in the novel doesn't come across well because of bad acting or because it just plainly isn't there. Jackie Earle Haley was very good playing Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Patrick Wilson were OK, but the rest failed IMHO.<br/><br/>Ah well, to make my comment pleasantly readable I'll provide a quick summary of good & bad points:<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/><ul><li>The visuals were pretty good (except for Antarctica and Mars).</li></ul><br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/><ul><li>Movie pace didn't feel right... some parts felt dreadfully slow &amp; some rushed;</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Apart from the movie score itself, terrible choice of music that didn't fit the scenes mood-wise;</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The people in the city come across as 0 dimensional characters with no opinion, because lack of dialogue. This has serious consequences for the viewer caring about the movie's ending;</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Overall, the acting reminded me of an average soap opera. The words coming out of some people's mouths didn't sound convincing (especially Malin Akerman did a poor job);</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A lot of important themes in the book were not presented in the right manner, also some were non-present (fe. discrimination); </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Too much unnecessary violence that didn't suit the characters (fe.

"JerusalemFace","7","3","6","18 March 2009"," Mesmerising and monotonous in equal measure
","Based on the graphic novel of the same name, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, 'Watchmen' is set in an alternative 1985 and follows a bunch of ex-masked heroes, as they... try to save... the world? Themselves? You see, it really isn't as straight forward as you might think, so if you're looking for a fast and fun popcorn movie, look elsewhere. Watchmen isn't your average super-hero movie. Hell, it isn't even a super-hero movie, full-stop! <br/><br/>Possibly a strange comparison this, but 'Watchmen' reminds me of 'The Golden Compass', a film which I had awaited the release of for years. If you're not aware, it's based on Philip Pullman's first novel in the 'His Dark Materials' series of books, which is a work of literary genius. The books are dark, mysterious and subtle, and the film is... colourful, mainstream and over-the-top. After watching the film, I was overcome with disappointment, and yet, I still enjoyed it, because despite the many flaws with the film, you could still make out a cracking, wonderfully original story underneath it all. <br/><br/>I'd never read the 'Watchmen' graphic novel, and yet I was left with a similar after-taste after watching this film adaptation. I was bored and mesmerised in equal measure; this is a film which is both insanely pretentious and self-indulgent, and yet rich with the extraordinary imagination and originality of the novel. All of the good parts of this film are a direct result of the novel on which it is based (and which, on a positive note, this film has caused me to start reading), and all of the apparent flaws, are down to the director's taste.<br/><br/>So... the director: Zack Synder... you may be familiar with his work on '300', which I found to be quite ridiculous; a fantastic example of style over a substance; and yet some may argue it changed the face of movie-making. Once the opening 20 minutes of '300' had passed, and the feeling of awe and wonder at the visceral and exhilarating action had subsided, I quickly became bored and confused. Does everything really need to be in ultra slow-motion? Even the bits where it's just a bunch of guys walking? (Mind you, I suppose it did bump it up to the length of a normal feature film).<br/><br/>Sadly, his patented style is still abundant and present in 'Watchmen'. And whilst it is perhaps more justifiable to use this method of film-making in a story as complex and epic as this, it actually detracts from the gritty and stark realism the novel was always meant to imply. 'The Golden Compass' made the same mistake. It's ironic that in trying to make a story more cinematic, and whilst being almost completely faithful to the chronology of the story itself, Snyder has removed the very essence of what makes 'Watchmen' so very poignant. The question, ""what if super-heroes really existed?"" simply never occurred to me whilst watching this, because I was so utterly removed from the alternate-reality Snyder has created. Sticking to Alan Moore's less stylistic vision of America, and more humanistic exploration of the characters, would have engaged the audience far more, and thus forced them to ask the questions the novel clearly evoked.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, despite the presence of some great tunes, is often bemusing. Philip Glass's 'Pruit Igoe' is beautiful and gets me every time I hear it; Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Sound of Silence"", however, is far too obvious to accompany a funeral scene. Moreover, using Bob Dylan's ""Times They Are a Changin'"", whilst again a little ""on-the-nose"" to accompany the opening montage where the audience literally see the 'times-a-changing', is nevertheless an inspired choice; using Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" during an excessively prolonged sex scene really isn't. Speaking of which, both the seemingly endless nature of the sex scene itself, and the choice of music to accompany it, further exemplifies Snyder's unrelenting need to overstate everything.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are some things Snyder gets right. For one, he doesn't pander to the Hollywood formula, and the 'Watchmen' we get to see on screen is just as unconventional and controversial as the version you can read on the page. Nothing in the Watchmen world, from the characters to the story-arcs is straight-forward; nobody is wholly good nor wholly bad; nothing is black or white; everything, like life, is pretty grey. At times the convoluted plot may leave you feeling a little disorientated, and perhaps this is why Hollywood usually rigidly sticks to the tried and tested formula we're so used to seeing, but Snyder and Warner Brothers should be applauded for having the bravery and tenacity to deliver a movie unlike any other.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is the originality and complexity which will divide audiences and is what left me with mixed feelings. Technically, everything is close to flawless; the actors portray the wonderfully diverse characters with aplomb, the special effects and production design are simply fantastic, and I found the plot to be both engaging and thought-provoking. But the whole experience falls short of delivering any kind of lasting emotion and it is this lack of connection with most of the characters, that creates a somewhat puerile atmosphere.<br/><br/>Like, 'The Golden Compass', though, I believe that the strength of the source material shines through in the end and, despite its many flaws, 'Watchmen' is too unique and rich with detail to be ignored. Be warned, it's at times violent, subversive and perverse but this is a more courageous attempt at mainstream film-making than pretty much any other, and for that, is completely deserving of your attention."
"dfle3","10","3","6","17 March 2009"," A masterpiece
","For a few years now Hollywood has effectively been driving a silver stake through the heart of superhero movies by flogging them to death. ""Watchmen"" is a movie which isn't devalued by being released after a spate of superhero movies. For some reason, I've been watching these superhero movies. Sure, I like them, but how many of them have repeat viewing value? Not ""Hulk"", but ""Hancock"" definitely. In children's movies, ""The Incredibles"" was terrific. Not ""The Dark Knight"" either, though Heath Ledger's ""The Joker"" was the sum total of that movie's greatness.<br/><br/>Of all the superhero movies I've seen, ""Watchmen"" is the ONLY one I'd call great. The rest look boys' own adventures in comparison.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" will not be a movie for everybody. It's hardcore in parts. Here, in Australia, it is rated ""MA"". In my view, an ""R"" rating is warranted. There are scenes in this movie that would not look out of place in ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"" or ""The day of the dead"" or ""Taxi driver"". Perhaps its gore is on a par with the terrific ""Sin City"". The camera does not blink-there is much strong and bloody violence in this movie. Apart from the gore, there are also brutal fight scenes. No punches are pulled.<br/><br/>There is full frontal male nudity and sex scenes. ""Watchmen"" is also not an ideal 'chick flick' either, as there is a strong rape scene in this movie.<br/><br/>So, it's not my intent to put you off seeing this movie. Quite the opposite. Just be prepared for something a lot darker than ""The Dark Knight"". And if my preceeding descriptions of the movie have got you salivating with anticipation, then there is the flipside of this movie...it does try and get profound. More often than not, movies which try and do this bore one witless (as a kid, I remember ""Star Trek: The motion picture"" being a terminable bore). However, the intellectual musings of this movie work well...just be aware that it is in this movie, and if it not for you, you will have to wait a while for the 'good stuff'...though the opening of the movie does constitute 'the good stuff' too.<br/><br/>OK, how to liken this movie to others which may be touchstones for you? Think of it as part ""Apocalypse now"" (for the philosophising on the dark side of man), ""2001: A space odyssey"" (for general philosophising and delving into 'The Profound') and ""Sin City"" or ""Taxi driver"" for graphic violence.<br/><br/>No, ""Watchmen"" is not a movie for the kiddies. It is a very adult movie. It can be confronting if you are lulled into a false sense of security about superhero movies based on what you've recently seen.<br/><br/>Without going into the plot too much, it concerns a dystopian world where superheroes are being murdered for some unknown reason, by someone unknown. Having superheroes in a world can't but change the world...in this world, those changes include President Richard Nixon not leaving the White House in disgrace and hence continuing his term for another four years or more.<br/><br/>And the superheroes who do inhabit this world give rise to thoughts in the viewer: what is a superhero? Who is a superhero? As far as superheroes go, there is a colourful gang in this movie. Are some/none of them worthy of the moniker ""superhero""?<br/><br/>About a week before I saw this film, I bought the comic book it was based on. Did not read it before watching this movie. So, I'm unbiased towards the movie in that I have no preconceptions as to what the movie has to live up to. Like ""The Incredibles"", having no great expectations for this movie allowed me to find the greatness in it, without being disappointed by any hype it may have had, or preconceptions. This movie did not disappoint...it exceeded all my expectations. Only a few cheesy glances between some characters struck the wrong note with me. Not enough to put me off this movie.<br/><br/>This movie deserves some Academy Award attention in 2009, I think. Like ""Best film"", ""Best adapted screenplay"" etc. A cast of unknowns does justice to the terrific story.<br/><br/>Unlike other superhero movies, this is a movie that will reward repeated viewings. It's depth assures that.<br/><br/>Essential viewing...for adults. Enjoy the stunning opening to this movie...and the great music which is employed throughout it."

","This is an attempt at writing a review for ""Watchmen"". I can only try to give a comprehensive summary of my thoughts, as it's incredibly difficult to get a grip on this unusual movie.<br/><br/>There I said it: The movie is unusual. Very. That in itself is a good thing. After ""300"" director Zach Snyder delivers yet another visually stunning motion picture. This man seems to be destined to make eye-candy comic book adaptations for the big screen. What surprises me is the fact that ""Watchmen"" did so well at the box office. I would have thought that this lengthy, highly philosophical piece isn't made for mainstream audiences. Well, I was wrong.<br/><br/>So Snyder succeeded commercially but is ""Watchmen"" also an artistic triumph? I haven't made up my mind, yet. Having not read the original graphic novel, I can only judge the movie by itself. As I've said, the visuals are definitely something to remember (except for a few mediocre CGI shots of Dr. Manhattan and the glass building that comes out of the ground on Mars) and the movie is unlike anything I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Just being different doesn't make for a masterpiece, though. And as much as the movie intrigued me, it was also hard to sit through at times. The pacing is just so damn slow and it's hard to figure out what's going on for the most part. The weird mixture of different time periods, leaves you scratching your head. What are the makers trying to say with all that symbolism? Most of the time you feel like when you first watched that scene in ""Matrix: Reloaded"" where Neo meets The Architect, wondering whether you're too stupid to understand the meaning of it all, or if it's all much ado about nothing.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm partial to the latter option. For all artistic value, I still want a movie to be entertaining or gripping. ""Watchmen"" was neither, but maybe a second and third viewing could change my mind.<br/><br/>In the end this movie could either become your new bible or it could disgust you for all its pretentious loftiness. In that aspect ""Watchmen"" is very similar to cult movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix"". If you liked any of the above, then go see this one."

","Why does the one well-written, but extremely negative review of a great movie always get picked for the main page? Trolling...?<br/><br/>I did not read the graphic novel, so I could hardly be called a fan-boy... but I still loved this movie. You will too, provided you are up for deeply flawed, comic book superheroes running around in an alternate reality circa 1980's U.S.<br/><br/>Beware, the film richly deserves it's R rating for brutal violence, fairly graphic sex scenes, and some full frontal nudity. This film is no place for children (or squeamish adults)... but if you've seen (and still enjoyed) movies like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Sin City"", you won't be too shocked.<br/><br/>There's a rich, gritty back story to each of these characters, told in flashback. Despite what some have said, I did not find this confusing at all. This is a sweeping tale which required masterful storytelling which was done seamlessly. I loved the nostalgic pastels and fashions of bygone eras in the retro scenes.<br/><br/>If you're still intent on seeing this movie, do NOT wait for the DVD. This is a sweeping tale that makes for a jaw-dropping film and it really must be experienced on the big screen."
"vrillsharpe","10","3","6","16 March 2009"," Great movie, demanding, uncompromising like Rorschach
","I swear I must have been in a black hole of comic fandom in 1985! After the movie was announced last year, I sheepishly avoided questions about having read the book. (I had not!) Then all copies of the graphic novel that I had missed sold out or skyrocketed in price! As soon as a reprint came out I picked one up and read through it. So the book and movie is quite fresh with me. I thought both were excellent. Watchmen doesn't pull any punches and is largely faithful to the book. Zack Snyder and Dave Gibbons did a fantastic job bringing Watchmen to the screen. Like Rorschach, the movie does not compromise.<br/><br/>But that could be a detriment for some. It's a movie by fans for fans. While fans will love Watchmen, it may be a mystery for the initiated. People who don't like comics may not get it. The good news is that those people are now in the minority! In 1985, when Watchmen was published, the first mainstream comic movies, Superman and Batman had just been made. <br/><br/>Watchmen is a deliriously complicated puzzle of a story. Tough to do in a film! Watchmen succeeds brilliantly without taking itself seriously. Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan and The Comedian are easily the most complex characters in any graphic novel and could have fallen out of the pages of a Dostoevsky novel. The brilliant acting treatment given to them by Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is really top notch and certainly carried the film. The film is well worth watching for Jackie Earle Haley alone. The look is glorious as well. The Artist Dave Gibbons was very involved with the film and in most places it follows the book panel by panel. Sure there were a few changes, but nothing untrue to the spirit of the novel."
"msairio","5","3","6","16 March 2009"," fun but disappointing.
","When I saw this movie a week ago, I walked out of the theater not really knowing what to think. The film definitely had not held up to my high expectations but I had enjoyed it despite myself. Afterwards I told my friends it was worth seeing, although there were some glaring problems. More and more as the week went on, though, I found myself thinking about the movie and how it stacked up against the book and found myself feeling more and more disappointed with what I had seen. Ultimately what stuck with me most about this movie was how not challenging and not compelling it was. For an adaptation of a revolutionary book that really changed the game as far as how graphic novels could be written, Watchmen the movie plays it very safe and comes of as ultimately being tame and kind of awkward even. I'm not so sure sticking to the story of the graphic novel as closely as it did was such a good idea. Sure fans of the book were craving a fidelitous adaptation but it's important to remember that comics and movies communicate in very different ways and that trying to adapt duologue word-for-word and shots directly from the panels, while loyal to the text, wont automatically make a good movie adaptation. I have some other complaints that are pretty specific, but this one is kind of hard to put into words. I guess what it comes down to is that the movie felt like it was missing something - maybe commitment. Watching the movie, it almost seems like director Zach Snyder was so afraid of screwing up, he couldn't bring himself to do anything really interesting or give the audience anything to think about, at least not anything new, which kind of begs the question: why adapt it in the first place? There's an answer to this question, but I don't know if Snyder ever bothered to seek it out. Instead he made a mostly faithful movie of a great graphic novel and wound up with something ultimately mediocre. live and learn i guess.<br/><br/>As far as specific complaints about the movie, my foremost complaint is about the soundtrack. I cant tell you how much a decent soundtrack would have improved this movie for me. As it stands, the music is either clichéd or inappropriate to the point of being distracting. ""The Times, They are A-Changin'"" despite being a little obvious, I thought worked well for the opening credit sequence but after that it just goes downhill. ""Sounds of Silence"" for a funeral scene? ""Flight of the Valkyries"" for the Vietnam war? ""All Along the Watchtower"", ""Me and Bobbie McGee."" Who picked these? a fourteen year old? I mean could the songs have been any more obvious or over-used? And then there was the use of Leonard Cohen's ""Halleluja"" during the already god-awful sex scene. beautiful song. terrible application. I don't think I've ever seen a sex scene try to take itself so seriously and fail at it so badly. ""99 luftbaloons"" is in here too and will confuse the hell out of you as to why it was chosen for the scene it's in. <br/><br/>as far as acting goes, I was most disappointed with the portrayal of Laurie Jupiter by Malin Akerman. For a character with a lot of emotional baggage, she seemed pretty vapid and stiff. I also wasn't crazy about Patrick Wilson as Night Owl. While he seems like a good pick, his performance, with a few exceptions, seemed forced and as stiff as Ackerman's. There were some bright spots though. Jackie Earle Haley was excellent as Rorschach. He even looked the part when his mask was taken off and really overall did a beautiful job of capturing the Rorschach character - he gets a lot of screen time which is good. I also differ from a lot of people i know in liking Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan and Mathew Goode as Ozymandius. Though, they aren't quite how I imagined the characters from the the novel, they both put an interesting spin on the characters and ultimately stayed true to them, which was enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Ad a final, nit-picking complaint, I found the CG Bubastis to be really annoyingly CG looking.<br/><br/>Ultimately, It was a fun movie despite itself but it doesn't really stand on its own. I'll probably see it again but it'll be hard not to think of how much better it could be."
"velcrohead","8","3","6","15 March 2009"," A big blue tallywhacker reigns supreme, but still a decent story
","Watchmen has been one of the movies I've been waiting to see for quite some time now. As a fan of DC comics, I was very hopeful, and given the past history of DC movies I knew it would be either really great or absolutely horrific.<br/><br/>It wasn't bad.<br/><br/>Granted, there were a few things I had to get past. The graphic violence was tough to watch, frankly. Parents do need to know that this is NOT a kids' comic book movie.<br/><br/>I was also distracted initially by Dr. Manhattan's ever-present herculean dong. I'm no prude, by any means, and I have a healthy sex life, but it's just that natural reaction of ""hey, wow, there's that guy's pecker"" and not knowing whether you should look away or what. I get the point of it, but it sort of distracted me from the movie in general. (On a lighter note, it does give new meaning to the term ""blue balls."") Rorshach has been and always will be my favorite character from the Watchmen universe, and he's portrayed here quite beautifully. Jackie Earle Hayley did a superb job of simultaneously making the character an ice-cold action hero and a supremely disturbed psychopath, all rolled up into one big anti-hero. I would've liked to see a movie or series that focused specifically on him.<br/><br/>There's a lot of social commentary in the movie. Frankly, you really should read the book first, because it can be confusing if you're not up to speed on when/where/what universe this takes place in.<br/><br/>As far as pacing, this movie does last three hours, but it's mostly non-stop the entire way. I didn't tire of the movie so much as I did the actual theater seat. Still, I wouldn't cut the movie any shorter or it would completely lose its punch.<br/><br/>All told, I give the movie about an 8, taking away one point for alterations made from the graphic novel, and another point for getting dick-slapped by Dr. Manhattan one too many times."

","Who watches the Watchmen? Well, those who want to be taken on a three-hour thrill ride extravaganza, that's who. This movie never lets up. It constantly pummels you with explosive action, twisting plot lines, steamy romance and first-rate special effects. It's a visual orgasm. It's popcorn for the brain. It's the ultimate superhero flick.<br/><br/>But that only scrapes the surface of WATCHMEN. It's also a dark and intricate story that challenges the viewer to care for a world where Nixon is still president, caped crusaders are real, and nuclear war is imminent. Word of caution: THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL COMIC BOOK FLICK! It's far superior in terms of intellect; it may even require a second viewing to catch all the minute details.<br/><br/>The characters are not all that relatable, they're likable - but they're cold and distant. Hell,they're superheroes  what do ya expect? The manner in which each hero views the world is what brings them together, they understand the evil that lurks in the hearts of men.<br/><br/>The story is pretty deep - it may be very entertaining, yet it is no run-of-the-mill blockbuster. It isn't summertime yet, right? Those experienced with WATCHMEN already know it is by far the greatest graphic novel ever conceived. Translating it to the screen is no easy task. However, director Zack Snyder (best known for his film ""300""), accomplishes this feat and still stays true to the novel's essence.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its flaws, there are important pieces missing that only die-hards will notice and a couple cheesy scenes between Nite Owl and his love interest, Silk Specter, but all in all Snyder does the novel justice and presents a thrilling piece of art. Quite an achievement since many would argue the graphic novel is un-filmable, including WATCHMEN scribe Alan Moore.<br/><br/>Those of you who are impressed by the assertive tone of Clint Eastwood and the vigilante anti-hero demeanor of Heath Ledger's ""The Joker"" will love the soon to be infamous character and Watchman named Rorschach. Expect to see as many Rorschach costumes this October 31st, as there were Jokers last Halloween. Hopefully, no one goes as the Watchman named Dr. Manhattan, it might get a little cold out!<br/><br/>Let's be clear here, the film is not as brilliant as its source material. It doesn't break any new grounds in terms of genre-defining tactics but it manages to up the ante set by the Dark Knight, without following in its footsteps. It's darker, it's more violent, and it's more complex  even to a point where it risks alienating viewers who don't know what to expect. The fact is  some people will leave confused, some will leave frustrated but all with leave smiling :)"

","The comedian is a crime fighting superhero of the mould of Batman or Green Arrow, a mere mortal with exceptional fighting abilities, he is also about to meet his match. As his door is beaten down he is assaulted by an attacker who seems to know and counter all of his best moves, and they are pretty sweet. However after a 30 storey journey straight down to the street level the comedian is no more. This is the catalyst that drives the barely human Rorshach into action to revisit the members of his old team and try and figure out if this marks the start of an attack on all his old team members from the defunct superhero team ""Watchmen"".<br/><br/>Many films these days are over-hyped, dumbed-down or are turned into incomprehensible garbage, and while I heaped praise on ""Batman Begins"" my feelings on the ""Dark Knight"" are well known. Unlike Dark Knight, this hasn't been hyped to hell, nobody died before it came out so people's views aren't clouded by sympathy, and, unlike Dark Knight, I didn't really like the comic book. Yes, you heard right, I was not a fan of ""Watchmen"". Whilst the writing was okay (I preferred Moore's other works like ""Halo Jones"") the artwork was quite static and I found that lack of dynamism off-putting (Gibbons women look like men in drag!) <br/><br/>Add to the that the fact that the film had been branded ""Unfilmable"" due to the size of the original text, and due to the persnickety nature of the audience, it was likely that the books fans would have a go at the film for being not enough like the graphic novel or too much like the graphic novel and you've got a tight rope it is virtually impossible for the director, Zack Snyder, to navigate successfully. <br/><br/>So let's get to the guts of it. Is ""Watchmen"" any good.<br/><br/>If I was Alan Moore I'd start dancing in the street right about now. ""Watchmen"" the movie takes the original ideas, too grounded in a desire to be real in the novel, and lets them take flight on the big screen. The action sequences are awesome, with a great blend of the realistic consequences of violence, which Moore wanted in the original text, mixed with dynamic cinematic editing and framing to make them exciting to watch. Much of the dialogue and the best cinematic shots are taken directly from the source, but look so much better on the big screen. It was like the ideas in the comic-book, belonged here all the time, but on the page, they were too restricted, (the dialogue sounding especially good from the mouths of these character actors.)<br/><br/>Perhaps the masterstroke here though is with the no-star cast we have no baggage from previous roles, no ""oh, that's George Clooney as Rorsharch"" or ""Russell Crowe as Nite Owl"", etc. You accept the actors because nothing tells you that you are watching a movie, you are simply watching a huge story unfold before your eyes.<br/><br/>I went to see this with a friend who nothing of the comic book and he loved it, I knew the original source but was not particularly a fan, and loved it. Obviously there are a few minor changes (In a way the big change is actually cleverer device than what happens in the original story!) but these were of the kind comparative to the subtle changes in Shawshank, nothing worth writing home about.<br/><br/>Is it the greatest comic book adaptation of all time? I don't know, but it was a brave move by the studio and a ballsy piece of direction by Zack Snyder that has put this hype-played-down, superhuman-visual-treat in cinemas for the world to enjoy.<br/><br/>I hope you do, as I know I will again.<br/><br/>Joyous.<br/><br/>Nuff said!"

","Every analysis has already been made on this movie so there's not much left to say, read the other reviews.

Not the worst comic book movie ever but as a movie it's nothing special. I can't blame them for trying and some elements of this film were successful, overall though it just missed the mark by a wide margin. I can't help thinking it will still be viewed as a success, look at it's grossing, that will keep Hollywood afloat for a couple of years!"

","The biggest problem with the Watchman comic is that the nuances only emerge after repeated readings. There's really no way to capture this in a film, where the goal is to be entertained in one sitting.<br/><br/>While faithful to the comic, as a film, it fails. However, if you enjoy ""300"" style fight scenes, this movie will not disappoint.<br/><br/>For me, while I had nostalgic enjoyment at how it followed the comic, and I do enjoy 300-style fights, the film rang hollow and the actual story seemed tinny and archaic.<br/><br/>Overall, while fans of the comic will not be disappointed, I think this story was better told in 1989 than 2009."
"newstarinthesky","4","3","6","9 March 2009"," The adaptation of the book that needn't have bothered
","First things first, I really like the book - not obsessively, I just REALLY LIKE it. I think the changed ending did make sense in the context of what they chose to include in the film, so I've got no big issues with the film, it was just, very... flat. It's mainly a very literal translation of the book, the changes and deletions largely make sense but the denseness of the book just seems to drag on the screen. Rorschach works very well on screen and Niteowl really comes across well too.<br/><br/>But the lurch as the film follows the episodic nature of the comics seems really odd in the film leading to huge gaps between character appearances where you tend to go ""Oh, I'd forgotten about him"". As such I didn't really feel for any of them.<br/><br/>By far for me the worst aspect of the film was the over-reliance on gratuitous and unflinching violence. The book certainly doesn't hold it's punches but it cuts away from the real nastiness because the suggestion is enough. But Zack Snyder seems to have a real obsession with showing every aspect of violence from bones splintering out of broken arms showering the scene with blood to repeated images of Rorschach hitting someone in the head with a cleaver. There was no need for this whatsoever. It was not necessary for the plot, the suggestion would have worked just as well. The film could have dropped a certificate with the exclusion of this and wouldn't have suffered at all. It wasn't in an attempt to be faithful to the book, the sawing of the prisoners arms was neither present or necessary.<br/><br/>Generally speaking great books and great comics need to be changed to be good in a different medium. Film is a different medium and the cut and paste of the book to the screen is moderately successful, but dare I say it as a fan of the book I think the film would have benefited from being its own animal. LOTR wouldn't have worked as a literal film of the book, neither Jurassic Park, etc etc. As such I wish I'd saved £6 and read the book again - Watchmen is the adaptation that needn't have bothered."

","Hmmm? I am not sure what to make of this film. The one thing I know is that I didn't come out of the cinema feeling satisfied but I didn't just dismiss it as a pile of pap like I did with films like SWAT. I am still mulling it over in my head a day later.<br/><br/>It was clearly well made. Great special effects and loads of atmosphere. The characters were very interesting and the fight scenes were great. The studio had clearly set out to make a quality film and not just to rob us of our hard earned cash.<br/><br/>However the timeline jumped about all over the place and I must admit to getting lost. I could not work out if the Watchmen were heroes, terrorists or vigilantes as the end seemed to justify the means. I could not work out if the government supported the Watchmen or not. The film took along time to tell us where and how the characters came about and still didn't explain properly (where did they get their skills, strength and fighting abilities from?). Which is not so bad but I did spend too much time trying to figure them out as well as trying to concentrate on what was going on in the film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack had some great music but they did seem to have put a CD in the machine and hit the RANDOM button. None of it seemed to fit with the action on screen.<br/><br/>Overall I am just left feeling a little empty from the whole experience and I did find myself looking at my watch a few times towards the end (some of the audience did not wait that long before leaving).<br/><br/>It was a story about the paradox of human nature.........I think."
"the_mercer","4","3","6","8 March 2009"," Or I could just read the comic again
","Fist of all I am not that opinionated a person usually, I think I have only commented on like 2 movies before this and I use IMDb every day but... Watchmen the movie really adds nothing to the already very good comic. I was hoping to go watch a movie adaptation that was you know....entertaining. But all I got was pretty much what I had already read except on the big screen. While it is probably easier to turn a comic rather than a novel into a movie I think it is a mistake to do nothing to the comic and just film it as is, especially a comic like Watchmen that was already wordy complex and very loooong.<br/><br/>Maybe the fan boys of this comic who are very precious about the text will approve but I found it (save about 3 scenes) too long and boring, with unusually ill placed graphic violence, which I usually love and weirdly over emphasized sex scenes(guessing some pervy producer was involved there). So many of the scenes could have been cut as they repeated points which had already been made (yes we get it, the blue dude finds it hard to understand humans anymore! OK society is complex and contradictory just get on with the freaken story!).<br/><br/>If the movie really adds nothing to the graphic novel, which already has a massive audience, then why make it? I was really looking forward to this adaptation but I felt I was just reading the first draft before you know...they edit it down and make it entertaining, make it watchable...like a movie. Hmmm maybe I'll just go watch Iron Man again that was not so pretentious and actually entertaining. Anyway I'll get over it :) oh 300 wasn't great either..."
"will2000uk","5","3","6","8 March 2009"," Honestly, who will watch the Watchmen?
","I'm sure Alan Moore would have an ironic chuckle at the superficial treatment of his work. That's not to say it's a train-wreck flop, but I do honestly wonder who it's supposed to appeal to and what the point was.<br/><br/>It sounds odd, but the film it reminds me of most is Daredevil- there is a playful narrative structure, a desire for a ""darker"" comic book film and a degree of campness that is either unwitting or woefully misjudged.<br/><br/>For those who don't know the plot, essentially someone is killing off superheroes and a gravelly voiced man in an ink blot mask (Rosarch) is investigating. The superheroes themselves are now retired (except the aforementioned tar gargler) and suffering various personal issues.<br/><br/>The problem is that things have come full circle- The Comedian looks too much like Robert Downey Jr, the issues of a double life have been better explored elsewhere, and Sin City has already provided us with gaudy, superficial shocks and violence. Granted, none of these film adaptations would exist without Watchmen's subversiveness, but it still feels like an ageing hipster trying to prove he's ""with it"".<br/><br/>And then we come to ""visionary director"" Zak Synder. What is clear is that he loves Watchmen, and tries his best to match it. But it's like a fairground caricaturist painting Mona Lisa- I'm sure he means well, but it's not the real thing. Now I'm sorry, but in my opinion the ""visionary"" tag belongs to people like Stanley Kubrick, David Lean or Orson Welles. Pretty pictures and ludicrously OTT violence doesn't make you an A-list director, nor does the vast sum of money a film might make (though in this case more likely from kids sneaking in).<br/><br/>If this sounds harsh, it's not because Watchmen is a bad film. The Dr Manhattan storyline is well handled, and adds some much needed pathos and tragedy to an otherwise superficial story. As Gilliam rightly predicted, the running time of a film doesn't allow sufficient room to breathe for the other characters, so we aren't give enough to sufficiently care about them.<br/><br/>In short, a good metaphor for the film is its soundtrack- for every clever use of Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel, we get the ill-judged Leonard Cohen Hallelujah (a great song now sadly overexposed) or 99 Red Balloons. If you can forget the comic, if you don't mind excessive violence and slow motion and not that bothered about character development, by all means go and see it."
"emilyweiland","10","3","6","7 March 2009"," one of the best, with some reservations
","First off: I'd recommend reading the comic first, but it isn't necessary. I went to the movie with my sister and she liked and understood it just fine, though there were one or two minor points that didn't make sense (one due to a detail omitted from the movie, another just because she missed it.) From the perspective of someone who really likes, but is not overly obsessed with, the source material, I can say that it is very good, both as an adaptation and a standalone movie. The attention paid to detail by the filmmakers is appreciated, as are some of the changes they made to the story.<br/><br/>The changes range from tiny to massive, really. The ending (the end is the same, but not the means) is changed from the comic, and I think that while it would have been fun to see the original, the one used in the movie functions just as well and is a bit easier to swallow for most people. Something that I both liked and disliked was the omission of a certain character's death. It also slightly disappointed me (and confused my sister) that the origin of Rorschach mask and of his masked identity are never mentioned (if you haven't read the comic and don't plan to, just ask a random person who has to tell you about it. It's worth the two-minute explanation.) The quality of acting runs across a broad spectrum. On one end, we have Malin Ackerman, who barely emotes (even during intense scenes.) Patrick Wilson and Matthew Goode are solid. Also, i you've seen the trailers and Billy Crudup (the blue guy, Doctor Manhattan) seems stiff, his portrayal actually works very, very well. It's not quite what I expected, but the calm monotone really suits, and adds to, his character. And then there's Jackie Earle Haley. Wow. In the words of my sister, ""that guy that played Rorschach is a damn good actor."" Not only is he visually perfect for the role, his out-of-mask acting is awesome (in the most literal sense.) He really brings out the insanity, intensity, and melancholy of the character; his final moments in the movie (and readers of the comic will know what part this is) are nearly perfect in their chilling, electrifying delivery.<br/><br/>Of course, it's also a beautiful action movie with a great score and soundtrack (though it may make you cringe every time you hear Leonard Cohen's voice ever again in your life.) The long run-time feels just right. It's got some killer costumes and it's got gore.<br/><br/>The gore. Though there isn't too much more of it than in the comic, the aggressively realistic portrayal of bones breaking, mouths foaming, arms being severed and heads splitting makes it seem much more excessive. There are some scenes that have been altered to gorier situations, oddly both of them involving the same character (perhaps to make him seem crazier? I don't know.) It's not for kids or the faint of heart (and features a couple of film's most deeply, intensely awkward sex scenes,) but Watchmen is certainly worth the time and functions well both as a mildly thought-provoking story (particularly for newcomers) and a pretty blockbuster. Watch it, seriously."
"tharnax","4","3","6","7 March 2009"," 20% amazing. 80% crammed together butchery of Moore's classic.
","The filmmakers tried their best, but anyone who read the original comics WAY before this became a screenplay can understand that it was badly butchered, a great deal of unnecessary blood and gore. SERIOUS cuts had to be made for time which badly hurt central, CLASSIC characters' development.<br/><br/>I absolutely applaud the effort, it shows real passion for the story and characters. This one-of-a-kind graphic novel and instant classic was never really do-able as a live action film, but no one can blame Snyder and friends for trying! Poorly stitched together, much like Moore's other classic 'V for Vendetta'."
"xah-2","7","3","6","7 March 2009"," The Watchmen falls just short of great
","Lots of spoilers for the film and comic book. <br/><br/>This movie works like a thank you gift from Hollywood to comic book geeks, and it is much appreciated. Director Zack Synder almost makes a true adaptation of the famed comic book series, The ""Watchmen"" (1986-87) created by Alan Moore, writer, and Dave Gibbons, visual artist. The biggest change is that Snyder drops the giant ""alien"" squid. Taking its place are a number of powerful bombs that Adrian Veidt develops by stealing the scientific secrets of Dr. Manhattan. The giant squid is the great surprise of Moore and Gibbons's ""Watchmen."" It shocks the reader both in its bizarre nature and in its consequences. The ""Manhattan bombs,"" if you will, are mainly depressing, not shocking. The film closes on the depressing note of millions of people dying in a mostly conventional manner. The lighthearted happiness at the end of the graphical book series--juxtaposing pleasantly to the shocking climax--is retained in the movie, but the happy closing scenes now stand out jarringly following the movie's depressing climax.<br/><br/>Moore and Gibbons force their readers to question not only utilitarianism (as in ""Do the ends justify the means?""), they also bathe their readers in a deep sense of wonder. Many strange things happen in their world, horrible, incredible, beautiful, and shocking. The shock of their ""Watchmen"" provokes thought. Moore and Gibbons commented intelligently on the comic book genre and society. What Synder had to do, inescapably, was adapt the words and pictures to the screen. Yet, it was simply impossible for Synder to do that in 2009 and simultaneously bring the feeling of the ""Watchmen"" to the screen.<br/><br/>There is an old Roman saying, to the effect that one cannot step into the same river twice. Moore and Gibbons confronted a different world with their comic book series in 1987 than Synder does with his movie in 2009. Synder's smart decision to keep the film set in 1985, like in the comic book series, made unavoidable the sense of anachronism.<br/><br/>Since DC Comics asked ""Who watches the Watchmen?"" in 1987, the Berlin Wall fell, the USSR imploded, communist China converted to capitalism, Al Qaida terrorists murdered 2,974 people on 9/11/2001, the Internet has connected billions around the world, left-wing criticisms of society have become a daily staple on television and in the newspapers, and the comic book industry transformed itself from a punchline to a trial laboratory for multimillion dollar movies that will seriously contend at the Academy Awards. The near-underground nature of Moore and Gibbons' 1987 ""Watchmen"" became a subcultural icon with countless devotees and fanatics. Synder cannot step into the same river that Moore and Gibbons did. Today's river barely resembles the old.<br/><br/>Zack Synder has carried the ""Watchmen"" flag up a hill in the face of the debilitating machine gun fire of film executives, conventional film adaptation traditions, profiteers, and the jaded Hollywood kitsch factories. Synder went to battle and he came up 99% successful. He deserves credit and gratitude for the beautiful, brilliant odyssey that is this terrific film.<br/><br/>Synder could have done only slightly better. The giant squid scene should have been kept. Its key function is to shock the audience. Simply killing millions of fictional people with bombs is not shocking, it's just kind of sad. The presence of the giant squid would not have made a significantly better film, though. The film's other problems could not have been fixed at all. The film runs 2:45, a little too long for contemporary action/adventure audiences. Cutting scenes to make the film shorter would have cut the heart out of the story, however. Moving the setting forward to 2009 to a ""post-Nixonian American dictatorship"" would also have destroyed the film, even though it would have allowed the social commentary to not seem stale. Synder played a nearly perfect hand out of the one he was dealt. Nobody can go back in time with today's special effects, and film ""Watchmen"" in 1988. Yet only that impossibility would have made this movie perfect.<br/><br/>The music challenged the viewers' sense of schlock. The classic rock choices fit, maybe too well. ""All Along the Watchtower"" by Hendrix was the popular choice as opposed to the Dylan version. ""The Sounds of Silence"" during a funeral and ""Hallelujah"" during a sex scene were perhaps too obvious. Snyder didn't get Elvis Costello's original music into the film. The music chose classic rock instead of the indie rock of the comic book series. With the broadest possible musical brush, Snyder completes his portrait of late 20th Century American life, by simultaneously memorializing its most loved music, and opening the door to semi-sacrilegious questions about the value of our modern music.<br/><br/>I love Synder's film. In many ways it is an improvement on the book. The characters come alive and almost become real. I like how Synder kept nearly all the elements of the book that he could. Silk Spectre putting away the disposable coffee cups was 2 seconds of film that put a big smile on my face. I don't know why Moore thought that people would want to drink coffee after escaping a fire, but then, that's the ""Watchmen."" A number of the film's touches made me smile, and even laugh. People who are not already fans of the ""Watchmen"" will probably leave the theater unimpressed. As for commercial success, this film might not sell out in theaters, but it will sell a large number of DVDs. A few tasteful action figure toys would probably also sell well. I can see a lot of geeks keeping a replica model of ""Archimedes"" on a bookshelf. Even as a fan of the movie, and of the original graphical book series by Moore and Gibbons, I have to say the movie is not perfect, but it's enjoyable and unforgettable.<br/><br/>Let's give Zack Synder a round of applause for delivering on a steep challenge, and doing a real service."
"couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn","6","3","6","6 March 2009"," Faithful, but flawed
","Watchmen is Alan Moore's renowned comic series about superheros' attempts to save themselves from obsolescence and to save the humanity from itself. By placing them into a more realistic psychological and emotional context, characterizations point out the perversion of the concept of superheros and the cultural implications of their existence. <br/><br/>As someone who very much appreciated the comic book, the movie was a mixed bag. There are some really great (faithful) translation of parts of the comic book, but overall, I would say that the movie suffered more than benefited from the strict adherence to the source material, as the emotional core of the comics ended up becoming neglected. <br/><br/>(Spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>The biggest failure of the movie was that the nuclear holocaust felt shallow, empty. I generally liked the movie up until that point. The mass killing was served as a linear plot element, not the epic punch to the gut that screamed out the absurdity of the comic book superhero. <br/><br/>Several main reasons why: <br/><br/>-The event is mostly seen through a TV within the film screen, hence making the audience trice-removed from the cataclysmic scale and implications of the mass genocide <br/><br/>-The allegorical pirate story, which mirrors the insanity that drove Ozymandias' actions, is missing from the movie--I did not realize how crucial this was to the understanding of the comic book until I watched the movie<br/><br/>-Matthiew Goode as Ozymandias was not very good--the character Goode constructs is not the super-rational zealot who works toward the ""good"" of human kind, but rather a one-dimensional comic book villain <br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan's reversal in his decision to help human beings avoid the mass killings felt rather clumsily handled as well. <br/><br/>(End spoilers)<br/><br/>The movie is not a waste of time, but it has some deep flaws. If you're going to see the movie to be entertained, it will, more likely than not, succeed. But it doesn't quite deliver the impact of the original work--with the core missing, it's merely a pretty shell of what it's supposed to have been."
"bayside_montauk","6","3","6","6 March 2009"," A good movie in its own right, but that doesn't cut it!
","I know a 6 seems harsh. The movie is good. Well done with good acting. If there was no source material I would have thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a feat not easily accomplished and it should be praised as a movie. However, I simply refuse to give this a higher rating. The fact that this was even made into a movie is appalling to me. Hollywood needs to get over comics and give them back to the people faithful to the medium.<br/><br/>Watchmen was the first comic i ever read and it opened up so much to me. It is so much more than what people see comics as. This isn't Batman, Iron Man, X-Men, Wolverine, Spider-Man, or any of the other properties being whored out to moviegoers. Watchmen is literature and is layered with great characters, compelling story, great writing, infinite references, and themes that run far beyond what comics had ever been. Trying to make this into a movie is like trying to put everything from LOTR into a movie. It's too dense and the subtlties of the graphic novel simply cannot be put on screen effectively.<br/><br/>My other argument is one that people seem to overlook or dismiss, which really saddens me. Alan Moore never wanted movies made from his work. So far four have been made without his blessing. Why? Because DC owns his work. He literally has no choice but to separate himself from his own work. It's like working in a Taiwanese sweatshop. He was just labor.<br/><br/>That said, the movie is seriously flawed in relationship to the novel. So much is missing, it seems like the SparkNotes version of Watchmen. No Black Freighter, no Under the Hood. The density from the comics just isn't there because it couldn't possibly be. Dr. Manhattan looks great, but he is played wrong. Things about all the characters changed in the movie because real people played them. It was doomed to fail. Moore's writing and construction of each character is essential to the story and to all interaction throughout. The ending is changed, and it is terrible. Total Hollywood ending. Veidt still does it his way, but the effect is marred and the characters react differently. Zack Snyder wanted an edgy take on superheroes, but it flops for him. Also, none of the characters besides Manhattan have superpowers, but in the movie they seem pretty super. The whole movie feels like a soulless copy of the original. The choice of music is ridiculous, too. The only good choice was Dylan's at the beginning credits. Overall, it comes no where near what the comics are, a great piece of literature."

","Even in the golden age, not all comics were made for adults – Robin Hood and Davy Crocket still had their audience. Following a trend towards science fiction, they became superheroes.<br/><br/>Some of the early DC material wasn't too bad, but when Marvel came along, the rot set in, the target audience becoming younger and younger, until finally settling around six to eight years (and those of comparable intelligence). To understand, how big this audience is, one only has to look at the budget of movies like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Superheroes are back, but different. Whereas the creators of Superman and Batman were merely bringing a moment's joy to the boy, who was half a man, the people behind schlock epics like WATCHMEN are neither.<br/><br/>They are, quite simply, retarded. While their intelligence hasn't evolved since infancy, their sexuality and aggressive tendencies are those of the adolescent.<br/><br/>Their ideas of heroes and villains may still be those of a child, but the violence that fascinates them is not cartoon violence, and when you add the kiddie version of politics, Nixon and the Vietnam War, you get something very close to Nazism. In WATCHMEN the saint-like hero ""kills millions to save billions"" – you can almost hear Adolf shout: I told them so! After three hours of disintegrating people, you can hardly be surprised. Apparently, superheroes no longer save kittens from trees, and only rescue children from burning buildings as a sexual stimulant.<br/><br/>Human beings, after all, are ""termites"" to be exterminated as part of a greater plan or simply because they're not worth preserving. As always, the only excuse for this kind of Fascism is impenetrable stupidity, which is much in evidence here.<br/><br/>Not even the sorriest retired western hero in baggy underpants can match these idiots in all their transvestite glory, nor will it surprise anyone to discover that the female romantic lead is now no more than a rubber-doll with the intellectual powers of a vibrator.

","Zack Snyder did nothing wrong in this one. Great visionary direction again. In anything other than directing and/or special effects the movie fails on every level. The worst of it is the writing and the job that screenwriters did or maybe is not totally their fault because they tried to stay true to the graphic novel, and maybe It was not written on a very sophisticated or cohesive level in the first place. Dialogues are unwitty but they pretend to be saying something philosophical about human nature or current situation in the States; if you want current situation in the states watch V for Vendetta which cannot be even compared with this Watchmen nonsense. Acting was also not sharp, ""The Comedian"" was the only one who was actually acting and had a charm to his character, but other people were probably too lazy to act since they were often hidden by superhero costumes or maybe they were just not into that movie as most rational people would be. The girl was really bad, how and who cast her, i have no idea. I went to see this movie after being totally amused by the art and breakthrough in cinematography that ""300"" was able to accomplish in big part of Snyder's direction. Here he tries, but he cannot save this 3 hour torture flick (3 hours in a packed theatre with limited access to the bathroom) and the most interesting part is that the music director who provided such incredible music for ""300"" was probably too depressed or not into it that he chose the most boring soundtrack you could imagine. The fight sequences are good, maybe a bit too brutal, but entertaining enough to say that they were not bad. ( Be prepared for a 4 hour unrated DVD version with all even-more-brutal fight scenes footage) The length of the film is ridiculous, but as i said it was the least of its problems, if the movie was 90 minutes long, maybe it would play out better. In conclusion, if you are ""watchmen"" graphic novel fanatic or ""star wars"" junkie its your kind of material, if you neither, went in to see Znyder's continuation of ""300"" visionary art, educated, have knowledge of movie industry and simply wanted to see an intelligent work of visionary movie making, no such luck here, please come again. :)"

Snyder took the un-filmable and created what I can only call, perfection.<br/><br/>Hats off to this gentleman for bringing Moore's masterpiece to the masses."

","Very pornographic with numerous sexual scenes that are gratuitous. Nearly three hours of mostly fights that get boring because they repeat too often, so that 'you've seen one, you've seen them all'. Several vivid sex scenes that you can find at Porno shops and should not be in a movie for the general audience. Gratuitous use of the F word also. Confusing story line that makes sense later with anti-God themes where the secular ideas are set forth as truth, but the hearer remains silent or stupidly replies. The movie had about 15 minutes of good stuff, but most of the movie is depressing from start to finish. Thank goodness I only paid one dollar to rent it.

"Sirus_the_Virus","9","4","10","17 August 2009"," The better comic book film of 2009... Deep is the key.
","In 2009, we've had two comic book films. We had the well-crafted X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and we had Watchmen. Surprisingly, Watchmen was the better of the two films. There are a few reasons why Watchmen is the better of the two. Watchmen has what The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 has. It focuses on these heroes and their lives. It's one of the more realistic comic book films. I know there is a flying blue guy, but this isn't your average comic book film. There sex, blood, nudity, and it's one of the better comic book films. I wouldn't recommend watching it with your girlfriend. It's more of a manly type film, if you know what I mean. Women won't find it that appealing. Watchmen works well as a comic book film. It's dramatic, filled with action, it's violent, and it's great. It's also very deep, and to me, a deep film is a great film. Watchmen is the best comic book film of 2009, and I think you should see it.<br/><br/>The Plot: When a fellow Superhero is murdered, it is up to Rorshach to find out who killed him and this reunites the old superheroes."
"emtiph","1","4","10","11 August 2009"," What a waste of time
","I know there are a lot of very positive reviews of this movie (which is what fooled me into actually watching this film) but I suspect that most of the people that have come out of this 3 hour mess are too exhausted and feel too ripped off to devote any additional time out of their lives to bother to warn others.<br/><br/>This is the warning I did not have.<br/><br/>First of all, there is way too much full-frontal male nudity in this movie. Basically, a scientist involved with state-of-the-art radioactive stuff is involved in an accident. As a result, he's instantly super-buff, has bright blue skin and wanders around the movie buck naked, showing us his blue, radioactive penis every chance he gets for no good reason. Given his ability to manipulate matter, why the hell doesn't this guy manipulate himself some pants, a leaf or something.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, he uses his new found powers and replicates himself (still nude) multiple times to maximize visibility of his blue, radioactive penis for the audience. It is incredibly unnecessary and ridiculous; the director could have at least arranged some furniture or something for the odd 50 or so painfully long full-frontal nudity blue radioactive crotchial scenes.<br/><br/>Secondly, the film is far too convoluted and is nearly impossible to put together, not to mention it simply lacks substance. There are so many pointless scenes (not to specifically mention the full-frontal nudity blue radioactive penis scenes and a random sex scene) and while the visual effects are nice and there isn't really anything wrong with the acting (given what they're working with), the viewer becomes entirely brain-numb. I can't imagine anyone having a good reason to stay in front of the screen other than that you're paralyzed, are held at gunpoint or both. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie is too long.. especially for one that sucks this bad."

"imdb-19548","10","4","10","20 April 2009"," Superb
","I wasn't expecting this to be great given the ambiguous reviews I had read but it was really good.<br/><br/>The acting is very good with all the characters doing what is needed and delivering much better performances than you normally see in a superhero film. Haely steels the show as Rorschach whenever he is on screen although that may have more to do with the script than the acting, he does get the best lines and most brutal action scenes. Patrick Wilson and Carla Gugino supply the more human element with a believable romance and some very simple interaction. Wilson does get most of the jokes to deliver and some of them are surprisingly funny for an action film. Billy Crudup is mostly a special effect with little to do himself. Matthew Goode is fine as the villain although he is the most 2 dimensional of the characters.<br/><br/>The special effects are good with some spectacular visuals and the action sequences are well choreographed although a few of them are over-done to the point of seeming silly and pointless.<br/><br/>The ending is good, consistent with the tone of the film and not a simplistic happy ending.<br/><br/>All in all a great mixture of action, intelligence and humour."

I felt as if I had been given the closest thing to the Sin-City experience I had years ago. The violence was seminal, the gore welcome. The characters brilliantly played (all hail Rorshach!) As for camera-work, what words can suffice! It was artistic and hit every right note as with 300. The color, texture and balance as though carefully and obsessively picked to be beyond our expectations. The camera fulfilled my every desire. As for the music, I'll never hear the song Hallelujah and feel the same way again! Zack Snyder has given me faith in filmmakers.

Dr. Manhattan did look a little stiff (not down there) but the lip-synch did not appear to me to be off. The sex scenes and fight scenes were very graphic, very realistic and very appropriate to developing the characters and stories. The violence was very graphic (blood, burning flesh, severed limbs) it deserves its ""R"" rating. Please, do not bring kids (I saw some there) as the sex scenes were very graphic. I read the book, my wife did not, we both were able to enjoy, understand, and relate to the story. The ending made more sense to me than the one in the book, it seemed more realistic in the story line. They did eliminate Vice President Ford and some other characters and elements that I thought would be important, But as the movie is at three hours I guess something has to be cut.

","I had been looking forward to seeing this at the IMAX for so long. Maybe that made it all the more disappointing, but it's honestly one of the worst films I've seen for a long time. If it was supposed to be a sarcastic parody that makes fun of the juvenile fantasies of sad 15 year old computer geeks, it worked - but I don't think it was. Like most people who've not read the book, I hadn't got a clue what was going on by about halfway through, but since that was after nearly 90 minutes, I didn't really care any more either. I am quite a fan of both cheesy sci-fi (eg. Brazil, Bladerunner, Total recall) and some gritty action (No country for old men, Fight club), but it didn't work on either level. The sci-fi elements were very visually appealing, but emotionless, and the action sequences were some of the most disturbing things I have ever seen on film; apart from the gross-out splatter of dismembering and various executions (can just about deal with that) it was in particular the close-up slow-mo shots of a man hitting a woman very very hard in the face that I couldn't watch. I'm afraid I couldn't see any justification for it in terms of character development - there were plenty of other examples they showed of just how much of a head-case this ""Comedian"" is. Showing that level of violence against women is going to mess with those young boys' heads!<br/><br/>Having said all that, the film did have amazing visuals which make it worth watching on DVD (you can make dinner to get through the boring bits), some really hilarious sex scenes, a nice but totally underdeveloped love story and an interesting political subtext."

"ComicBookMovieGuy","1","21","88","25 February 2009"," Watchmen is easily the worst comic book movie ever made!
","Watchmen, directed by the second rate director, Zack Snyder is easily the year's worst movie so far!<br/><br/>I found the movie to be a too long, too pointless with no point at all.<br/><br/>Plus the movie covers every event in a four decade span of the 20th Century especially since this is an alternate comic book universe with Richard Nixon serving his fifth term as president. <br/><br/>It literally suggests that superheroes (Dr.Manhattan in particular) helped the United States win every single conflict in the last several decades making us the biggest superpower in the world.<br/><br/>From the events of World War II to the Korean War to the Vietnam War to the close of the Cold War, all with nuclear war on the minds of the audience. <br/><br/>My girlfriend absolutely was confused and didn't understand all the graphic violence (especially a murdered girl who is fed to two dogs and one of those dogs literally having it's head cut with a meat cleaver, as well as an ax shoved into the head of a child molester repeatedly) and waited for me in the lobby for an hour and a half.<br/><br/>This film did feel rather outdated with it's nuclear armament warnings.<br/><br/>Not to mention in this recession people are REALLY holding on to their wallets.<br/><br/>Women will HATE it. (At least today's chicks) <br/><br/>Pluses: Rorschach is the best character in the film. PERIOD.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan needs some underwear. (Is this a comic book movie or animated pornography?) <br/><br/>Nite Owl 2, (cracks me up with his erectile dysfuctionality) <br/><br/>Comedian rocks the house, but is killed at the beginning. However his actions are highly questionable and repulsive.<br/><br/>Dr. Voidt/Oxymandias is the worst character in the film, both literally and figuratively. Who cares if he thinks he's the smartest man in the world? (Needs a better actor) <br/><br/>I laughed out loud at the sex scene with Silk Spectre and Nite Owl in his flying submarine, as did the audience and her constant living up to her mother speeches.

"sreeharins","10","3","7","23 March 2015"," One of the best superhero movies of all time.
","First of all, I have not read the graphic novel.And I'm judging this movie purely based on what i saw on screen.And, i give it a 10/10 and regard it as one of the best superhero movies of all time.And there are plenty of others who would agree with me.Now the main reason why this movie stands out among all the other superhero movies we have, is this : <br/><br/>Take the majority of the popular superhero movies.In all of them, the superheroes are cut out from the comics and then they are translated to a real life version and then they are put into our world and then on to the screen.We kinda miss out on the world from where they come.And I think rather than a superhero movie where the central idea is ""what if this superhero existed in out world?"", I think it's better if could go into their world and explore what is going on there. Now this has proved to fail( batman and robin).But if done right, it is way more rewarding. That is exactly what Snyder did in Watchmen.It was breath of fresh air and I think it is very underrated.<br/><br/>The comical style of the movie is very fascinating.It is truly a feast for your eyes and ears.The characters are great.The theme is dark.It does not hold back at all.Even in the supposedly dark ""Dark knight"", they hold back a lot to make it more younger-audience-friendly.Watchmen does not do that.There is blood, gore, nudity and more darker themes.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to all superhero movie fans.If you haven't seen it already, do check it out. And make sure to watch the Ultimate cut."
"proterozoic","4","3","7","29 May 2012"," Watchmeh
","I missed the theatrical release of Watchmen in 2009, and just saw the Ultimate Cut on video. It is 3 1/2 hours long. It wouldn't have run a minute over 2 if all the slo-mo played at normal speed.<br/><br/>By the way, don't watch the Ultimate Cut. It's worse than the Director's Cut, because it includes Tales of the Black Freighter in the film's runtime instead of as an extra. The Tales in the graphic novel were a nice parallel narrative of gathering darkness and insanity. In the movie, they're badly animated, badly integrated, break the flow and lack all sense of visual style, dread and foreboding. The comic uses greens, reds and yellows to convey a look of runaway putrefaction, and shows the protagonist's mental degradation by always playing with the color scheme. The movie version has flat sand, flat blue water, flat green corpses, flat shadows. The protagonist looks like Nathan Explosion, and voiceovers everything he does in a mildly distressed monotone. In the comic, the Tales end simply, with hands stretching out to grab a rope, and yet the horror is suffocating. In the movie, they end with grinning demon pirates with glowing red eyes, straight out of second-rate 80s Disney.<br/><br/>So, what about the live action film? Well... It's faithful. It tracks the source material like a dachshund tied behind a bicycle. The only major change has been the ending  and, mirabile dictu, it's better (well, the concept is better – they ruined it with song, but more on that later).<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley is about as good a Rorschach as we could hope for. Danny Woodburn has a sweet scene or two. Patrick Wilson is a sad nerdy lump in tweed. That's the performances.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is a treat for aficionados of glowing blue penises. Credit where it's due, Zack Snyder doesn't tend to soft-pedal violence, nor did he nerf Dr. Manhattan's nudity. It's good to see a major motion picture that doesn't think seeing a dong will destroy my mind forever.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's about all that can be said about the visuals. The idea of special effects is to make the impossible or nonexistent look real. Snyder has kind of a reverse Midas touch, where even his real sets end up looking phony. Every surface in the whole movie looks like it was rendered with the Doom 3 engine. The worst is the glass clockwork thingamabob on Mars – I almost want to donate some CPU time on my video card, so they can add some radiosity to it or something.<br/><br/>On top, they added a green Matrix tint to almost every scene, except for a flashback to green Vietnamese rice paddies, which are tinted orange.<br/><br/>The music. How can you take so much good music and make such trite and horrible use of it? The opening montage –the only good use of slow-motion in the movie – is set to ""The Times They Are A-Changin'."" Flying to an Antarctic fortress? ""All Along the Watchtower."" Not obvious enough? How about a burial set to ""The Sound of Silence."" The solemn, dark ending? Mozart's ""Requiem,"" bringing you schmaltz since Bunny Lebowski's kidnapping.<br/><br/>The worst was the Vietnam flashback. Quick, what music do you think they picked for that one? That's right. It was ""Ride of the Valkyries."" God, did I hate this movie at that moment! About the only good use of music was Philip Glass's sublime ""Prophecies,"" during Dr. Manhattan's transformation.<br/><br/>Sound effects... It's the Hollywood thing, where every object visible on screen needs to make some sort of a clank or a clink or a shwing, otherwise the stupids won't notice that it's there. Snyder seems intent on doubling even the usual excessive sound environment, just to make absolutely sure that people notice that THERE'S A HAT TUMBLING THROUGH THE AIR!! When a character flicks a smiley-face badge into an open grave, it's the only thing happening on screen. There's no way to miss it. But just in case, they'll make it sound like a Russian helicopter as it falls: ""PLINK!... whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-WHOOSH-WHOOSH."" The action is just as subtle. Everything is in slow motion. Fight sequences are in slow motion. Punches are in slow motion. Rorschach's improvised flamethrower is in slow motion; the Comedian's Army-issued flamethrower is also in slow motion. Silk Spectre walks down a flight of stairs in slow motion. Twice. Getting into a car – slow motion. Getting out of a car? Slow motion. Elevator doors open in slow motion. A blue energy weapon explodes in slow motion. An assassin aims his gun in slow motion, fires it in slow motion, misses in slow motion, and gets his ass kicked in slow motion.<br/><br/>What if we still don't get it? Break the action down even more! Remember the hallway fight in Oldboy, how fluid and awesome it was? Here's the Watchmen version: a bad guy runs towards the good guys. Cut to his face, centered in the frame for a second. It gets punched (with a whoosh before and after). Cut to another static bad guy. He gets kicked. Cut to static body part. It gets broken/blown off/whatever. There is no flow, no sense of motion.<br/><br/>It's like Snyder thinks the only way to make people actually notice what's happening on screen is to center and pause on the action, and maybe also shake people by the lapels. It's like a four-year-old trying to get an adult's attention. ""Mom look. Mom, look what I got. MOM, LOOK. Mom, you aren't looking. LOOK MOM!!!"" Yeah. Watchmen is Ambitious, Personal and Faithful to the source, for all that's worth. It's just not really all that good.<br/><br/>Too bad, because the money people probably looked at the numbers and decided that mature, uncomfortable science fiction doesn't sell, and they shouldn't make any more. The real lesson is that they should; just put it in the hands of Alfonso Cuaron."

","In a nutshell, one of the best movies ever made, if not the best.<br/><br/>Based on Alan Moore's awe-inspiring graphic novel of the same title, the movie does a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of the book, paying attention to the tiniest details and using the book as a storyboard that allows the pages to come alive on the screen and transport, for the duration of the film, to a a darker but fascinating alternate reality while looking at history that never was but, perhaps, could have been.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with a mystery, and the tension keeps building as we meet a diverse cast of characters, enjoy spectacularly filmed, breath-taking sequences, and slowly other mysteries and unanswered questions turn the movie into a mesmerizing Chinese puzzle box in which everything, and I mean everything, can assume different shades of meaning that might at first appear isolated but really are always connected to the main themes of the movie, at times in ways we'll only recognize later on as we solve parts of the puzzle. <br/><br/>The action sequences are fantastic, original and superbly choreographed, but often take a back seat to the depth of character development (often touching but never clichéd) and grander themes that challenge us to ponder mysteries like; time, the corruption brought on by power (who watches the watchmen?) love and the nature of life itself.<br/><br/>A great director, a beautiful soundtrack, inspired performances by all the actors (special kudos to the man under the Rorsharch mask) and creative, stunning cinematography come together to bring to the screen one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking stories ever written.<br/><br/>Any film lover will count it among the best movies ever made, if you haven't seen it yet, enjoy it now, movies of this caliber are few and far between."
"Otterman_MK2","8","3","7","5 April 2011"," Rorschach's Journal: Saw awesome movie today.
","Being a fan of graphic novels I was introduced to 'Watchmen' by a friend and read it almost immediately. Needless to say, it was fantastic. I was aware that this had the potential to be a great movie, but if not done properly it could go very wrong.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Zack Snyder knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>'Watchmen' has a powerful opening that is only seen in the graphic novels as a series of flashbacks. Followed by a beautiful introductory credits sequence showing off the main focus of the time: The cold war, Watchmen continues this excellent pacing to the end.<br/><br/>I am aware that this film has picked up a lot of criticism, but the truth is basing a film of a graphic novel was always going to be extremely challenging, and considering this Snyder does an excellent job. Yes, the film may feel a bit too similar to the book at times, but it balanced this out with clips not seen (or not fully explored) in the graphic novel. To be honest, I think it is unfair to compare this with the graphic novel at all.<br/><br/>The film retains a dark tone throughout the film, so don't expect to walk out of this in a good mood. It will get you down. This film is gory, sexual, violent (and I mean violent!) and contains bad language. Stuff Toy Story, your kids will love this! If you are someone who struggles to understand the story (this is natural as the story is fairly complex) then I recommend reading the graphic novel beforehand. Obviously you will need to be in the right mood to watch this.<br/><br/>I felt that all the acting was perfect (especially Jackie-Earl-Haley as Rorschach), apart from Malin Akerman as Silver Spectre (she was not even trying to act!).<br/><br/>This is an extremely dark movie that you will have to experience for yourself, and while it is not perfect, I highly enjoyed it."

","In an alternate timeline, Nixon is still president and the world is sinking under the pressure of a cold war against Russia. A faded gang of superheroes lay dormant until one of their own is murdered, prompting an investigation that leads to a startling discovery about the future of the world and what the cost of peace and the salvation of mankind may be.<br/><br/>As director Zack Snyder's first film with actual characters in it, ""Watchmen"" takes its time in building a back-story for its broad range of colorful characters and misfits, and is all the better for it. The narrative bounces back and forth between the past and the present (which, as it turns out, is a fictional 1985) and yet, through the 162 minutes the film takes to reach its point, it never lets up for one minute or becomes a chore to watch. Truly, this is one film where you won't want to miss a minute, with each scene carrying as much weight and relevancy as the next. While the material at hand is very dark and mature, and even though it won't appeal to a younger or more mainstream audience, it is certainly a film that functions on multiple levels.<br/><br/>The film is chockfull of excellent performances from its cast, but it is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach who stands out from the pack. This brilliant casting choice creates an iconic character that, many years down the line, the film will be remembered primarily for. As for direction, Snyder flexes his cinematic muscle with enough caffeinated action and jarring visual effects to match wits with the dense plot at hand, in turn, making this his finest film to date. Sure, there is a plethora of directors who could have tried their hand at this material, some perhaps more qualified, but Snyder's film is both classy and stylish and, in a nutshell, as close to perfection as it gets. It's an assault on the senses as well as the psyche, and perhaps one of the darkest superhero tales of our time, translated flawlessly to film.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" might not be enough to pacify one of its creators, but the purists and movie-lovers alike will find it a rare treat in film-making where a film based on a graphic novel or comic book can capture its source material so beautifully while simultaneously stimulating and satisfying those who are not already initiated. ""Watchmen"" is one of those films that, as we look back on this decade in the future, will be talked about and remembered fondly as a definitive film for its era. This is not just one of the finest films of the year, but also one of the best of its kind."
"thebackofmyhouse","9","3","7","1 July 2009"," A non comic reader's take on it
","I'm not much of a comic reader and as far as I know before watching, the story was about a bunch of super heroes. After watching, I can say that I enjoyed it a lot. It's not like any other super hero movie. Unlike other super hero movies where the action is the actual star of the movie, Watchmen has it's story and characters to thank for in making it what it is.<br/><br/>Each leading character has dimensions to them. These are not your standard super hero do gooders. The movie manages to portray them as humans with flaws and all. It's amazing how the movie manages to present so much character development for so many characters, and do it so effectively. At the end of the movie, you feel as if you actually understand these characters' motivation and why they became are who they are.<br/><br/>And the movie's ""feel"" suits the story too. It's very dark story-wise and the cinematography together with the choice of music really contribute a lot in achieving the tone that the movie has. Overall, a very well crafted and original movie that delves into a world where super heroes are very real."

","the first time i saw the trailer for this movie i was mesmerized, i'd never even heard of the graphic novel let alone read it, i still haven't read it but i think that the movie was excellent from start to finish, the story and script were so well written and the actors delivered perfectly, the special effects were to drool over, and the action was no-holds-barred, the movie was slow at times but you never want nothing but violence, it seemed like every scene was important some how, and most importantly it kept your interest, you watch spider-man and daredevil and they fought the bad guys just like you want to see, but the watchmen had no mercy, some might say that Rorshach and the Comedian were sadistic but i think that every thing they did just added to there character and every scene whether it be a sex scene or a violent scene graphic as it may be was another great addition to the characters, the actors turned in a great performance in what is possibly the best movie based on a graphic novel, so thats why i gave it a 10/10"
"Kee_Nim_Mak_Mak","8","3","7","3 May 2009"," In my opinion, movie adaptations are a highly overrated phenomenon
","The beauty of the graphic novel, as Alan Moore and David Gibbons were clearly well aware when they crafted possibly the finest work of its medium in the original Watchmen, are its visuals. The best examples can layer countless clues, leitmotifs and intelligent details into their frames that would take pages to cover in a normal book.<br/><br/>So in that spirit, allow me to sum up this review with one distinct mental image - Watchmen the Graphic Novel is the sweet over-sized cake. The cinematic medium is the undersized box. It's a testament to Zack Snyder's ability as a blockbuster director that he just about manages to squeeze the cake in, for the most part, intact - the taste is there, there's enough to satisfy one's appetite, but don't expect the edges to be smooth or for it to look like it did in the catalogue.<br/><br/>Okay, a little vague perhaps - allow me to elaborate. Watchmen the Graphic Novel has long been considered unfilmable. Terry Gilliam turned it down. Alan Moore's opposition to an adaptation has been vehement and well-documented. On the evidence of the final product, they were right - what made it to the final cut is very much a mangled Watchmen.<br/><br/>Character backstory is cut right back, sometimes even rushed - Rorschach's past, given a whole chapter to breathe in the GN, is cut down to one brief flashback. Veidt's, the poor bastard, is reduced to a PR speech. Only Dr Manhattan and The Comedian's curriculum vitaes make the transition with great aplomb - the former's four-dimensional flashback is brilliant, bordering on art cinema with its impeccably edited glimpses into Jon Osterman's past.<br/><br/>The cast of nobodies and vaguely-recognisable-faces helps to keep the 'comic-on-film' feel of the whole thing - there's no denying that would be lost if we had Sigourney Weaver in a yellow jumpsuit, as opposed to The Girl Who Played Some Boobs in Harold and Kumar Get The Munchies. But equally few of the performances stick out - imagine how the comic sounded in your head, and that's a bit like how this feels. The exceptions are Jackie Earl Halley's monotonous Rorschach (who's badly-in-need-of-a-Locket throat-growling just about stays the right side of Christian Bale's Batman) and a surprisingly brilliant performance from Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, who's as brilliant at being the refreshingly charming macho man's-man as he is on the brink of tears (in a moment of rare genuine emotion).<br/><br/>Key scenes in the GN are almost glossed over completely, which in a work that pays such relentless lip service to its source material leaves the whole thing feeling a little disjointed - the climax, after so much build, seems almost like an afterthought, and the fates of two key characters in the graphic novel get nothing but a passing cameo, making the whole thing feel a bit pointless. Oh, and whilst we're discussing the ending, that big point of contention with the fans - Snyder's new take works. Just.<br/><br/>Perhaps most bizarrely of all is the contribution of the soundtrack guy - it's a testament to the top-notch work a good soundtrack man can do that few reviews will ever need to point out when it works. In Watchmen it doesn't, and some of his picks veer from the flaming obvious to the downright bizarre. Case in point: the overlong sex scene to Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. Evidence B: Laurie's moving reunion with old friend Dan Dreiberg to Nena's 99 Red Balloons. Sometimes it feels a bit like someone on the production team spent a boozy weekend with a couple of compilation CDs - in all fairness, when it hits it hits well, as seen in the stunning opening montage set to Dylan's 'The Times They Are A-Changing' (in a sly wink to the fans that would take far too much time to explain).<br/><br/>On the bright side, and continuing with this somewhat strained analogy, there are moments when our cake is positvively enlivened by its box. The visuals are spot-on, the colour palette is bold and pleasingly walks the line between cartoony and gritty realism. The action sequences, if laden with a little too much unnecessary slow-mo and at times bizarrely inappropriate, are well executed, clear, and entertaining. The editing is superb (a staple of Snyder's films thus far).<br/><br/>Most importantly of all, it's a truly original work - there has never been a film quite like Watchmen before, and whilst it isn't entirely successful, it packs a stiff kidney punch to a genre still reeling from the blow Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight dealt it. It's a long way from perfect, but it is important - it's the mark of a genre maturing, zits and all.<br/><br/>So, got the idea now? If nothing else in this tenuous cake analogy we've learned that sometimes it's better to keep certain things in their own boxes. Be they comic frames or otherwise."
"Hylia","10","3","7","30 April 2009"," Who Watches the Watchmen? I DO!
","This was one of the BEST super-hero movies I have EVER seen! I have read the graphic novel and when I went to see the movie I had some idea of what to expect but even then this great movie managed to make my jaw drop! Never have I seen a movie that is actually ""true"" to its source! Everything in the novel was faithfully reproduced on screen, from Dr. Manhattan's glowing blue visage to Rorschach's shifting mask...it's all there! The acting of this feature was simply superb. The best by far was Jackie Earle Hayley as the murderous, cold-hearted Rorschach. He took the comic-book character and gave him a face-lift like no other. His raspy voice and intimidating appearance was all that was needed to bring this amazing character to the screen. His costume was picture perfect and reminded me of those film-noir detectives of the old days that spent their time solving mysteries in the dead of night. Rorschach is no exception to this as he is the only one to take action and figure out what is going wrong with the world.<br/><br/>The other characters all had their two cents as well. Nite Owl II was great and true to his comic book roots. Silk Spectre II will no doubt be the source of every young man's wet dreams...talk about sexy...WOW! Malin Akerman was absolutely STUNNING! I even enjoyed the Comedian as well...his gruff attitude and scarred face are what set him apart from the other Watchmen. I also highly enjoyed Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). He was incredibly well-made through the dazzling art of computer animation and he seemed very real in my eyes. Speaking of eyes...I loved Dr. Manhattan's pupil-less glowing eyes. Very cool.<br/><br/>As with most action-y movies, this one is loaded with it. Violence abounds and there is even a steamy scene between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre II. Rorschach too provides a good dose of blood and gore. Chopping in a man's head with a meat cleaver is sure to curdle a few stomachs so I warn you now to shut your eyes if you are of the squeamish type.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is sure to become the smash-hit of the year and might be up for an Academy Award or two! Great work Zach Snyder! You pulled another masterpiece out of the hat!"
"xxltmoney","10","3","7","25 April 2009"," The Watchmen was One of the Best Superhero Movies I've Ever Seen!!
","I have never been so impressed (well, maybe for the Dark Night) with a movie like The Watchmen. To know I must feel, you would have to know my background. When the movie first came out, I was going to go to it but my father said I couldn't because it was too inappropriate. By the end of that month, I had forgotten about the movie and was not even excited to go see it. My dad then let me go see the movie. It was only playing in one place in Denver at 9:40 p.m. and I knew I wouldn't get another chance to see it unless it came out on DVD. Within the first 5 minutes, I was hooked. The action was great, the storyline was great, even the opening credits were great. The characters were very well played and I don't even think the book could compare to the movie. You almost felt like you were in the time periods that they were in. The movie put you in some sort of mood that made it feel like you wanted to be there. That's not even half of what I can think of saying but all in all, the movie was phenomenal. Thank you for making it!"
"malikroberts16","Null","3","7","23 April 2009"," Watchmen was such a waste.
","It sucked hard. I couldn't even follow the movie. For a bit, I thought I was watching comic-book porn. Saw it with my dad because we both liked the trailer and thought we might give it a try. Well, it just so happens it was a gigantic rip-off. It was somewhere between shameful and inexcusable.<br/><br/>I just know Hollywood's better than this. They have been, many times, even in my lifetime. I can't believe Warner Bros. OR Paramount would put out something as unbelievably bad as this.<br/><br/>Dad and I couldn't even sit through the whole thing. We walked out about a half-hour before it was over."
"TOMNEL","7","3","7","16 April 2009"," The end result is less than satisfying, but the entertainment value throughout is through the roof.
","It seems as though the result of a truly good movie would be to make the viewer think long and hard about what they just watched. ""Watchmen"" does make the audience think, but not in a good way. It's overly long, with a climax that really isn't that great, and because of this the last 45 minutes drag and go on and on. As for entertainment, there is much to be found, but this mish mash of a movie just isn't the great superhero character study it could and should be.<br/><br/>After the murder of superhero The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), members of a disbanded super group meet together for the first time in years. There seems to be a murderer after these superheroes, but who it is, is a mystery. Many sub-plots ensue.<br/><br/>The characters are all written fairly well. The Silk Spectre (Malin Ackerman) is poorly acted, which brings down the character a bit, but it's just a minor thing. The writing is at times good, and at times too soap operatic and melodramatic, but again this is just a minor thing. The direction is what really stood out, and it was quite snappy, if not repetitive. Slow motion is used every 2 minutes, but it goes unnoticed because of how cool the scenes are being shown in that slow motion. The special effects add to the cool and slick direction, and make this a good looking movie, if nothing else.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie takes these characters that we've grown to like over the past 2 hours plus, and puts things in perspective....this is not a good thing. First off, it compromises the characters, making their morals that were previously what drove them, pointless. Second, the ending takes us away from what the movie is (a character piece), and it focuses on the human race as a whole, something that should have been done long before. Our focus does a complete 180, and no longer do we care about the well developed characters, but instead about the complete strangers who have been hanging out in the background this entire movie. This switch didn't work too well for me.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a stylish and entertaining film, but it is overly long, takes itself too seriously and has an unsatisfying ending. But of course, this is just one person's opinion.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 161 mins. R for strong violence, language, nudity and sexuality."
"sarastro7","10","3","7","6 April 2009"," Not bad!
","Being a comics collector, I usually attend new superhero movies on the opening night, but I have a bit of a strained relationship with the Watchmen comic. And, having decided to reread it before seeing the movie, I had to delay seeing it for a week or two. The comic (not originally a graphic novel; that's the collected edition that people call a ""graphic novel"" now, although it's more properly a trade paperback, only recently also given the hardcover treatment) has always been hard for me to read. Reading it is not much of a pleasure-giving experience for me - it's too dark, too misanthropic, too marred by a negative view of human nature. Which is kinda funny, because a lot of Alan Moore's other work is not like that at all. Watchmen is a singular work, probably intended as an experimental take on what a realistic world with superheroes, who were realistic characters, would be like. As a fan of classic superheroes and science fiction, I'm really not that interested in realism; I'm much more into idealized stuff where it's pretty clear who the good guys and the bad guys are. Watchmen only has relatively grey characters who're neither entirely good nor entirely bad, partly because they live in a complicated world where very few choices can be all-good. That's what this story is, mainly: an exercise in greyness. Even if the world is saved, it happens at the cost of millions of lives. There can be no good here, only a variety of evils, and the trick is how to choose the lesser evils over the greater ones. Of course, in such a world there can't be any proper superheroes, and that is one of the biggest reasons that Watchmen (the comic) doesn't really work for me.<br/><br/>However, as a story containing an intentional message about moral greyness and the immense difficulty of making morally good choices, Watchmen is very successful indeed. It comprises an uproarious contrast to the usual superhero comics, which are morally black and white, never in doubt as to what's good and what's bad. I don't think Watchmen is intended as a scathing critique of the usual type of superhero stories; rather it is simply an exercise in reversal, in doing something different, and in so doing throwing the usual tropes of genre storytelling into sharp relief.<br/><br/>The movie translates the comic into its own medium very successfully - if perhaps a bit *too* faithfully. Since I had just read the comic when I saw the movie, very little in the movie surprised me at all. It was really just going through the motions of the comic, using it as storyboards for the movie, and as such appearing as if any director could have produced an identical movie. The comic, and all its images, have become so iconic that nobody dares make any substantial changes, it seems. Well, all right. I suppose I would have complained about it if it hadn't been like the comic. Still, I do think it looked more like ""a comic book movie"" than a proper movie in its own right. But I enjoyed the images, and found them quite a bit more palatable in this form than in the comic. So, high marks from me!<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was the only thing that was changed from the comic. It was a fairly good change, using a quite convincing substitute idea. But the change also has bigger implications. In the movie, we end up with a world that believes itself to be watched by Dr. Manhattan, who then scares/forces people into submission much like the anti-war robot Gort did in the original The Day The Earth Stood Still. But, what's to keep people from reverting to warlike ways once they discover that Dr. Manhattan is gone? In this way, I think the movie transmits an even bleaker view of human nature than the comic.<br/><br/>The genius of the ending in the comic is that you don't quite know whether Ozymandias' new world order will remain in place, or whether Rorshach's notes will blow the whole thing wide open and throw the world back into chaos and war. This is brilliant because the individual reader will interpret the ending according to his particular political view! If you are a cynical republican (or even just a conservative or libertarian), like Rorshach, you will believe that his notes will reveal the truth and throw off the yoke of Ozymandias' world order, replacing it with ""freedom"", in whatever form. But if you are an idealistic liberal who thinks that Ozymandias actually and heroically chose the least of all possible evils, and in so doing best represented human nature, then you will be unlikely to believe that the publication of Rorshach's notes will make any difference at all. Nice one, Mr. Moore!<br/><br/>By having an even bleaker view of human nature, the movie actually understands the point of the comic, and enhances it by disguising itself even more (also through the Comedian - a ""good guy"" who keeps doing things that no remotely heroic character would do) as cynical and pro-Rorshach, when in fact its deeper attitude is the reverse: The world of this story really has a true hero, and his name is Ozymandias.<br/><br/>Look upon Alan Moore's genius, ye mighty, and despair! :-)"
"andyhise","10","3","7","21 March 2009"," Flawless. But I Had Read The Book...
","I should say that, when I like something, I tend to be completely uncritical. It happens rarely, though. The first time I saw CONTACT, the night I saw DOGVILLE, and AI, the night I was at the London celebrity premiere of THE ABYSS, and when we watched .REC one dark night. There's plenty more, but nowhere near enough. My perfect movie drug is a hard fix to find. When it happens, I'm happy for days afterwards.<br/><br/>Last night, I saw Zack Snyder's WATCHMEN, and it's going to be a happy weekend. Last weekend I finished the WATCHMEN graphic novel for the second time (1st was 10 years ago), and loved it again. NB: I am not generally a fan of comic books, or superhero movies. I thought BATMAN BEGINS was way, way, way better than the hugely over-rated DARK KNIGHT. The only other comic book series I have ever read was SPAWN, fifteen years ago, when I was in the toy business and we were working on the action figures... (still got some in mint cond, and a pair of SPAWN tracky bottoms which I've always been too embarrassed to wear...). But I had a feeling, going in to the movie, and having read plenty of reviews, that once again this was going to be one where I bucked the critical trend ... I approached it ready to experience an uncritical, complete pleasure.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN delivered it all. For me, Snyder is three-for-oh ... DAWN OF THE DEAD and 300 were superb, but WATCHMEN is a step up. I loved every second, but here's the catch: it's because I had just read the graphic novel. IMHO, watching WATCHMEN without reading the original first, you're more likely to hate it. The film is so full of flavour if you've read the book, in almost every scene a character mutters something, or there's a scenery detail, which gives a spark of pleasure to the book's fans...but which would be lost on the unprepared. Me, I was enthralled as, time after time, the movie brought so many key scenes - and tiny grace notes - to life from the graphic novel. Faithful to the source? Hell yes, and brilliantly too.<br/><br/>Let's list the key criticisms which others on IMDb have aimed at WATCHMEN:<br/><br/>Boring - I was wide awake and engaged throughout. Inappropriate music - the music rocks, the only bum note is Leonard Cohen (come on, he's rubbish). The sex scene - trashed as being cheesy and corny...I disagree, you need it, at that point in time, as much as they do...and it ends on a killer, laugh out loud flamethrower joke. Slow motion action - again, why people have trashed this is beyond me, it's part of the film's core visual style, you go with it, it's spectacular. Hard to follow - if you've read the book, it's a piece of cake. Different ending - Snyder's big ending is better than the book's, sorry Alan. Manhattan's willy - I mean really, it's there on screen, what, ten times? And not for long... A few sniggers in the cinema, but the good doctor's willy isn't THAT in your face. Dodgy CGI - Again, for me, part of the film's style, there's some photo-real stuff and some stylised CGI which is clearly part of the cartoon look.<br/><br/>And the actors. Look, I already told you, when I love something I love everything. Kudos to every single one - and special mention for Jackie Earl Haley and Patrick Wilson. And Malin Akerman, as they say in Barnsley, you'll do fo me lass.<br/><br/>I'll stop now, I loved it, WATCHMEN was staggeringly good, the special edition DVD just has to be a classic (come on guys, get it right). I wouldn't change a second of this film."
"DreddMancunian","10","3","7","20 March 2009"," Simply a Masterpiece
","In the 1980s, Alan Moore helped comics come of age. He created adult story lines of great complexity, filled with profound and sometimes unsettling ideas. Hollywood has consistently botched these ideas with the likes of Constantine, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the uneven V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>Until now.<br/><br/>This is a film you must see. Right from the opening tiles, where an alternate history of a USA full of costumed (and sometimes psychopathic) superheroes unfolds to the songs of Bob Dylan, this is Alan Moore's ""Watchmen"" as it was intended to be. The filmmakers have preserved exactly the spirit of the original. If you're looking for The Matrix, you will be disappointed, because this film is better than that. It is at once profound, eloquent, complex and visually stunning, action-packed, gory and beautiful.<br/><br/>The script manages to distill the best moments from the comic books and make the overall theme clearer. Fine acting from all the leads, a brilliant soundtrack that borrows from the likes of Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Leonard Cohen and even Koyaanisqatsi, reveals the true reverence the filmmakers have for the original graphic novel. Forget the muddied philosophising of The Dark Knight, this is Hollywood at its best - insightful, thoughtful, dramatic and exciting.<br/><br/>Go see this film...then go read the book."
"rffp","5","3","7","18 March 2009"," The Sum of Good Parts May Not Add to a Good Film
","I didn't read the comic book, but I had a good expectation on the Watchmen, and it disappointed me. The movie does have good moments, but the problem is they don't add up to a good movie. The movie spends a lot of time focusing on some aspects of the story, but some are just not developed at all. It is interesting to see a superhero movie that pictures them not as paladins of justice but as normal men and women with ""shades of grey"" and psychological problems, but they should do that for the right characters. Roscharch is a very interesting character, well played, but in the end he is not the main character and there is a lot of focus on him when the movie villain is treated very shallowly. Spectre II is presented as a troubled women by her mother's past but not well played by Malin Akerman. The Nite Owl seemed just like a weak guy with no will and completely submissive to Spectre's whims. Dr.Manhattan and the Comedian are reasonably well developed characters. The movie tries to show how the Watchmen interacts with the general population, but it seems a bit loose in the end.<br/><br/>*** SPOILER ***<br/><br/>For a story that supposedly wants to explore in depth the geopolitical conflict between two superpowers in a (not so) parallel universe, the writers could actually have studied history better. In World War II, the USA and the USSR did become allies to defeat a megalomaniac genocidal leader, but even before the war could end, these two nations were already on the path of conflict. For the ""world's most intelligent man"" to overlook this ""detail"" and believe that history would not repeat itself, well I just don't buy it. Whatever ""pluses"" the story had for me as a non-conventional superhero one, that big ""minus"" just blew them."
"jonnygs","3","3","7","14 March 2009"," Watchmen; nothing more than a pretty picture
","In Watchmen, Zack Snyder paints a pretty picture, but after a while the paint chips away, and instead of revealing something deeper, what's left is nothing but blank canvas. It is easy to see why Alan Moore, the author of the graphic novel has disowned the film (he had his name removed from the film). True, the way Snyder frames the shots and the stylized action sequences are enjoyable and a nice departure from most action flicks, but this isn't enough to save Watchmen from becomes a boring and empty film. Whereas the novel is more than an action story (so I am told by friends who love the novel, for I have never read it) the film is simply that. So, why don't I feel at least satisfied about the fact that it's just a good action film? Because it is not. It is overlong, 2 hours and 42 minutes, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Snyder stuck close to the material and the novel's thick narrative requires this length. In order to justify the length the film must be interesting almost throughout. But Watchmen is not. Having absolutely no clue what it was about, the film felt endless. I thought I knew when it was going to end, but it kept going. Glancing at the glow of my watch was an occurrence almost as frequent as it was while I was sitting through Appaloosa (2008). In terms of a film's most important aspect, narrative structure, Watchmen is uneven. At times it is interesting, and to Snyder's credit, the film shows the heroes, with the exception of Dr. Manhattan, as humans effectively. However, often times the film is slow and overly gruesome. This type of film needs violence but overt severing of limbs? What purpose does it serve? To show Rorschach's insanity? We understand his psychosis without these scenes, yet they are included anyway. A graphic novel is not a film, and in Synder's eagerness to stay true to the source, he forgets what medium he is working in, fails to entertain and makes Watchmen a waste of time. C"

"badajoz-1","3","3","7","11 March 2009"," So What! And why did bother?
","160 minutes of fairly shallow, CGI-dominated, at times tediously boring, fare that is supposed to be packed with meaning, deep themes, and action-plus. Forget it - this is another comic book adaptation that takes itself and its material far too seriously. Underpinning it is an interesting thought - what happens when superheroes are forced to retire? Answer they miss the buzz of kicking a**, and when they return to it again, it turns them on like sex, and for real sex too! Wow, it's just like a Fellini movie! A more interesting question, which us oldies who remember comics in the fifties before they were banned for some years in the UK as 'penny dreadfuls,' is why didn't Superman defeat Hitler and Japan in WW2? The question is asked in this film - Nixon (plus false nose) asks Doc Manhattan (Superman) to intervene in Vietnam, and he says 'yes', mopping up the NVA and Viet Cong in a week, with no qualms or explanation! But later on, after a crisis of conscience, he can't be bothered to stop a nuclear holocaust! And lo, the prolonged tedious tortured path to get from one point to the other - supposedly deep and questioning and meaningful - is absolutely boring and extremely shallow. This is a graphic novel/Hollywood movie not 'King Lear.' So any claims of deep interesting material in this film are rubbish. And as for characterisation, feeble and been done many times before in other shoddy comic book adaptations. For example sexy Silk Spectre 2 (doubling for Lois Lane and looking like a young Xena the Warrior) is upset because the blue genie (Doc Manhattan) - and, yes, he repeats a scene from the pre-war 'Arabian Nights' movie when he reaches inside a building for a normal-sized superhero - splits off a couple of replicants of himself when he is busy with nuclear fusion to pleasure her. So she moves on to the Batman substitute, who is more human if rather nerdy (cue the younger male audience for Rogen, Stiller, Wilson rubbish movies and their female fantasies) for comfort and one of the more believable sex scenes of recent times (it's been dubbed porno of course by the serious minded politically correct comic book moviegoer). And Malin Ackerman is worth an ogle if a little under-cantilevered with her kit off! Plot is complicated (read other comments if you want a summary), and not helped by hurried and garbled explanations of what is going on, particularly at the end, which is awful in its' disdain for the audience - almost like 'you got enough action and sex, didn't you, so who cares if the plotting is a bit dodgy and you missed bits.' The alternative 1985 is rushed and not quite believable. The nuclear bust up again is too rushed and does not work. Take it from me, I lived through the Cuban Missile crisis, and it felt somewhat more real than a Spitting Image Richard Nixon saying 'Go to DefCon 1.' The character of Rorschach is just an excuse for some ultraviolent, but gradually dimishing return, action that graphic novels seem to be steeped in - but they are drawings and not real! So when is Hollywood going to do animated graphic novels like anime, rather than spending vast fortunes on these very ordinary pictures that just use CGI to make up for quality and illustrate fairly minor points in the storyline? And it has to be said Americans will not like this portrayal of themselves in the Obama-era. That is a past that resides in the Seventies and Eighties rather than the hopeful end of the naughties which features Guantanamo Bay, Extreme Rendition, and bringing freedom and democracy to 100,000 dead Iraqis! Please can we have some well written and profoundly observed movies about now and the past that are not based on the shallow inanities of comic books. Leave that to TV and shows like Ben10 and the Justice League of America!"

","Me and 10 friends went to see it. 3 had read the novel including myself and loved it. 3 hated it because they went in with high expectations and the rest were neutral. it wasn't hard to follow, but without the subplots like in the novel it was hard for people who haven't read it to follow. except for the end when it was all given away. The long running time does not help this. most people will see the movie before reading the novel. those who haven't seen it I suggest not going in thinking its a who done it movie or its going to be like 300 or it's going to blow you away with something new. It is something new but it won't blow you away. watch, then get your hands on a copy of the novel and then leave your comments if you feel the director did a bad job etc. I think Zack Snyder did well to follow the novel, add his little extras and try and make it appealing to those who haven't read it. with so many super hero movies out and coming out I'm not surprised people where disappointed. they got something completely opposite to what there used to seeing. Will it flop? I don't think so, I just hope that too many people do not let themselves be persuaded by critics leaving negative comments."
"fritzofgalatia","5","3","7","9 March 2009"," Rather bland
","I really had no expectations going in. I did some preliminary research on what to expect short of actually reading the graphic novel (ie talking to friends, wikipedia, fan sites, etc). I liked the idea of more humanized superheroes, but nothing else really jumped out at me.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film very much caught my attention. Rorschach was a wonderfully (or should I say horribly?) interesting character and his internal dialogue was a good way to start. We are introduced to the principle characters and the alternate reality which Watchmen takes place in. All well done, especially for the casual moviegoer. The plot thickened and it looked like the film was panning out well. That was the first 30-45 minutes or so, possibly even an hour. It went by quick and was fairly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The next hour felt like an eternity. I think the film makers were trying to develop the characters a bit, but it was either bland or extraneous. For example, yes the Comedian was a bad dude. I get it. I don't need stupid amount of background story on the guy to understand it. I would have preferred more background on the characters who were actually alive and contributing to the plot. Dan and Sally were very superficially developed, leading their actions to seem more random than intentional. Speaking of the plot, it seemed to disappear during this middle part of the film. Rorschach beats up some prisoners and Dan and Sally sleep together and then put their costumes back on. Dan is somewhat understandable since Rorschach had recently called him out, but Sally I just can't rap my head around. Wasn't she just saying she didn't miss the life and never really wanted it in the first place? The result was a very tedious hour that culminated in soft core porn (which was so over the top I could do nothing but laugh).<br/><br/>Thankfully, with Rorschach's escape from prison the plot returns and rapidly develops (as does Rorschach's brilliant internal dialogue). However it just wasn't enough to rescue the film from the past hour. Perhaps I had just checked out from boredom. Perhaps it's that I don't care for the ultra-pessimistic view of human nature that Watchmen has (although I very much liked V for Vendetta which had a similar style and feel). Regardless, the end was just depressing. Some parts of the movie were enjoyable, most notably Rorschach, but overall it wasn't well done. Oh and if this movie was as true to the graphic novel as some people are saying, my guess is I wouldn't really care for that either, so I suppose the joke is on me for going in the first place.<br/><br/>P.S. It still kicked the crap out of that fiasco that was Spiderman III"
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","6","3","7","8 March 2009"," Too long and too boring for it's own good.
","The first big blockbuster of 2009 is upon us with Zack Snyder's take on 'Watchmen', one of the biggest graphic novels ever. Snyder has made a movie so large, so massive, and so epic that it collapses under its own weight. There is no denying that it is technically brilliant, much like Snyder's previous 2 efforts - in fact, it is probably his most technically marvelous creation yet - but that doesn't change the fact that Snyder's near 3 hour film is too long for its own good, and despite a story that lives up to its reputation, is unbelievably boring.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see this movie with a lot of people who read the graphic novel so I got their opinions as well. We all discussed how we felt about it, and they all insisted that I needed to read the novel...that's all well and good, and I'm sure (more like positive) that the novel is indeed legendary, but it appears as if Snyder has pulled a Chris Columbus and made a direct translation from page to screen. What must be understood is that things that work in a novel may not work on a movie screen. You can have two hours of character development in a novel (or the equivalent, I guess), because books are meant to be that long. In a film, you cannot afford to have 2 hours of character development in a movie that runs just under 3 hours. It simply will bore the viewer to bits, especially when the action is few and far between. Don't get me wrong, the characters are all very interesting people that deserve their screen time - but that's what Extended Edition DVDs are for. I have a feeling I'll love this movie on DVD - when I see the full cut and have the ability to pause. In a movie theater setting, however, 'Watchmen' is simply too boring, empty, and heavy to be enjoyed like other comic book movies of late.<br/><br/>What drives 'Watchmen' would be the allure of the characters. While some, like Patrick Wilson's, are simply boring ripoffs, the others, such as Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach and Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, are phenomenal. Those two are easily the best thing about the movie, while Jeffrey Dean Morgan's take on The Comedian is a close third. Each of these actors gives their character their all, including their heart and soul. Haley's turn as Rorschach could be the performance of a lifetime as the ruthless, immoral, yet somehow good hero with a mask as mysterious as his attitude. No matter how cruel his character may be, it is Haley's convictions that assures us of the true goodness of the character.<br/><br/>I found myself eagerly awaiting almost any scene with Dr. Manhattan, and while women will obviously enjoy him the most (I'll get to that in a minute), I was particularly impressed with Crudup's ability to channel what might be one of the most emotionally detached character's I've ever seen. Crudup's turn is monotone, but never droll or wooden. It is all the more impressive because the only part of Crudup himself that's in the finished product (besides the flashbacks) would be his facial expressions.<br/><br/>While those were the stars of the show, I wish I could say the same for the others. I think Patrick Wilson was confused as to which character he was playing. He played his character as if he was Captain America, instead of trying to carve a niche as a new character. There was nothing I hadn't seen already in this performance. Malin Akerman really needs to stop being like Jessica Alba and being either stupid, wooden, or both. Matthew Goode is the only acceptable one of this bunch.<br/><br/>While 'Watchmen' certainly boasts a number of technical marvels, the film is under-edited and feels extremely episodic as a result. Was this Snyder's intention? Did he want to replicate the feeling that original readers got awaiting the next issue? Whether or not that was his goal, it's something he did, and it really bores the viewer to pieces. I really can't stress how flat out bored I got in this movie. Even the action is so sparse and unexciting that I just really couldn't get invested in the film, because I half expected myself to walk out. Yes, the film's editing is terrible...but it is beautifully shot, and just looks like a dream. 'Watchmen' is one of the most visually pleasing films you'll come across...except one...problem...<br/><br/>Gratuitous nudity. Was it REALLY necessary to show Dr. Manhattan completely naked in 75% of his scenes? I think that one or two scenes of nudity from him would of been enough, once in the sex scene, and once to get across how detached from humanity he is. My friend told me that it was to show how he didn't care about human emotion and embarrassment, so why would he wear clothing? That's FINE when you're reading it...you can skip to the next page. But in this case, you are pulled out of your experience in the film to say, ""Holy crap, it's a blue c~ck"". It's sad when a simple addition of a cloth could have saved me losing my focus and wondering why it needed to be shown.<br/><br/>Is 'Watchmen' the product of a lot of hard work that shows? Yes. Is 'Watchmen' a good movie? In a word, no. It's crippled by a director's need to please a supposedly rabid fanbase with what appeared to me to be a near direct translation from page to screen. I did like the film's ending and story as a whole, but it is extremely hard to become invested in said ending and story because of the fact that 'Watchmen' is a film purely for those who have read the comic, and is extremely boring and overlong. In my eyes, it is a disappointment."
"gerbinator2009","10","3","7","8 March 2009"," Rant
","If you went to this movie expecting another cookie cutter super hero flick you were probably very surprised and disappointed. Watchmen is unique. The hero's are all portrayed as actual people with actual problems. Much of the emphasis of the movie is on characterization instead of having one action scene after another. <br/><br/>If I hear one more person complain about Dr. Manhattan's nudity I will start breaking things. He is not human. He is detached from mankind. He is almost a deity. He was nude in the GN so he should be in the movie too. The movie certainly didn't emphasize it, so anyone who was flustered by his nudity probably just found their eyes drifting toward his dick a little too much.<br/><br/>I don't get it. Do you look at Michaelangelo's The David and giggle like a little girl? 50% of people in the world have a penis. Get over it.<br/><br/>additionally, I don't understand why people get bent out of shape about a blue penis, but no one seems to find the little girl who was raped, then butchered, then fed to dogs disturbing.<br/><br/>Oh yea, one more thing. If you brought a young child to this movie you are a terrible person and a bad parent. A little girl started crying in our theater when Rorshach was hitting the rapist with the meat cleaver, and I don't blame her. It doesn't reflect well on her mother however who brought her 6 year old daughter to a movie with brutal violence and near porn level sex scenes."
"stefanjovanovicmelbstorm","10","3","7","8 March 2009"," A long movie and a worthy ride
","This new adaptation of Watchmen exceeded my expectations. I loved it after the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>For those who haven't read the novel or even heard of Watchmen, the movie is set in a alternative 1985 time-line, where thanks to a successful Vietnam War, Richard Nixon is re-elected for a third presidential term. The ""Doomsday Clock"" is set five minutes to midnight as tensions rise between the Soviet Union and the USA. In the middle of this all, a superhero vigilante, Rorschach, discovers a plot to kill and discredit all superheroes, past and present.<br/><br/>Thanks to the Keene Act, super-heroism is now illegal. Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II have given it up to lead normal lives. Ozymandias has revealed his identity, and is now brandished ""The smartest person in the world"". The Comedian, an aging superhero past his prime, has been hired by the government, and his murder sets the film in motion. Finally, Doctor Manhattan, the only Watchman with real superpowers after a nuclear accident in 1959.<br/><br/>This film develops a sense of morality to the common man, as it shows that some people, especially Rorschach, is willing to do the wrong thing occasionally to do good. Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach left me gasping as his magnificent portrayal of the superhero. Rorschach is portrayed as a man who has grown distant from society and believes the corrupt ways of life people live on will eventually destroy them. He continues superhero work, despite it now being illegal, and even goes beyond the boundaries to discover the truth.<br/><br/>Billy Crudup's performance as Doctor Manhattan also left me nodding in appreciation. Doctor Manhattan is portrayed as somewhat of a nihilist, whose seemingly god-like powers is the catalyst for the start of tensions between the USSR and the USA. He is also dating Silk Spectre II, but as he grows detached from humanity, this frequently causes him to neglect her and she promptly leaves him. Doctor Manhattan also believes humanity deserves to be consumed and destroy by the evil, greed and corruption that has put them in their current predicament. When he learns of Ozymandias' treachery, he finally realizes that humanity is worth saving, but decides to keep Ozymandias' horrific actions a secret in order to remain global peace. He even goes as far as killing Rorschach to keep peace. In the end, it seems he is willing to accept the fact he is now the enemy of the world and exiles himself to create new life, not destroy it.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie deserves 9/10 for its brilliant plot, actors and of course just the movie itself!"
"radiotesla2001","4","3","7","8 March 2009"," Heavily Sexed Up, Disguised, Rework Of Old Outer Limits TV Episode
","First, Spoiler Alert! Secondly, I have never read the graphic novel that, from my understanding, is the basis for this movie. This story, as filmed, is a heavily disguised redo of the Original Outer Limits episode 'Architects Of Fear'. I don't doubt that there are other commentators that have already mentioned this. I just have not had time to read all of the comments to date.<br/><br/>Anyways, the film makers (And I would have to assume the graphic novel authors as well) have justified the redo by somewhat reversing the ending, whereby in the movie, the plot of the 'Architects of Fear', (One person in the film) succeeds in scaring the population of the Earth into Peace and Disarmament. This is contrary to the 'message' delivered at the end of the OL episode, if I remember at all correctly, that if there is to be true peace on Earth, that mankind much achieve it on his own. He can not be frightened into it by real or imagined threats from outside (Read alien, or superhuman).<br/><br/>The brief scene at the end of the movie, where the lead in for The Outer Limits was seen on a characters TV set confirmed to me the real origins of this film.<br/><br/>I admit that it took me a pretty long time to realize what I was seeing in the movie (basically a redo); but once I understood that, it pretty much turned me off of the film for the following reasons: <br/><br/>1: I agree with the ending of the television show; that if we ARE to survive, it will have to be by our own choosing and development as a race, and not the result of fear of an outside, more powerful, agency. A perfect example of this is the United State's response after 9/11. We were all in 'kumbaya' mode for all of about 6 months, Dems and Repubs working together, but it didn't take very long for us to forget about the threat, which is still out there, and go back to bickering amongst ourselves. True peace for all of the human race will have to be achieved from within. Personally, while understanding the difficulties we face, I am more optimistic that the human race WILL succeed in avoiding destroying itself.<br/><br/>2: As I said above, the ending of the movie 'somewhat reverses' the outcome of the original Outer Limits episode. I felt that the last minute of the movie DID leave open a door for mankind's reversion of attitude; which meant that the deaths of millions of people would have been for nothing. Yuck.<br/><br/>3: Too much extreme violence, just for the sake of shocking the audience. All right already, we get it; you can spill blood and break bones in slow mo.<br/><br/>4: The fact that it is a weak revision of something that has clearly already been done.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the Outer Limits episode this story is based on, then it's not too bad a film. If you have seen the original, this is just a flashy, expensive, waste of time and money."

","Alright, I went to the movies not really knowing what to expect. I understood the chance of Watchmen being a complete failure, but I also knew that it had potential to be an amazing movie. Luckily, I had a great time, and I thought the movie was a complete success. There was a tremendous amount of things that made me really enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, I was impressed by how consistent the movie was. Some movies are very good at the beginning and your interest slowly dies as the movie progresses, but not Watchmen. Watchmen kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Halfway during the movie, I really needed to use the restroom, but I was so completely mesmerized, I didn't want to miss a second!<br/><br/>Secondly, I would like to compliment Zack Snyder on putting this graphic novel into a film and also respond to some rants. I truly think Zack Snyder was the best man for the job and respect him completely for staying faithful to the novel and for making this movie amazing. I've recently read some of the comments posted already about this movie and a lot of them have said ""not as good as the graphic novel"" or ""terrible compared to novel"". I myself am a huge fan of the Watchmen comics, and don't understand why all of you are so bitter. You may think the novel was better because of the way your mind perceived the novel when you first read it. Imagination has no limits when you read, so you can make something much more glorious than it truly is. But when it comes to actually putting it on the big screen, things can get extremely tedious and difficult. But personally, I think that all you big Watchmen fans should be proud that the comic book that you read and adored is on the big screen, and you should respect Zack Snyder's hard work and effort to put this into film form.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I thought the storyline pieced together perfectly in the film. Even if you have not read the graphic novel, I think you can catch onto the story of this movie quickly and jump right in the plot. The movie does a great job of introducing the characters and also does a fantastic job on showing the era that this story took place.<br/><br/>Finally, I am very excited that Watchmen took advantage of the ""R"" rating. It was very macabre at times, but it was great! Also, there was quite a bit of sex, and one glorified three minute sex scene! If you were planning on taking your 8 year old son to see this movie, just be ready to cover his eyes up very often.<br/><br/>Overall, Watchmen was a fantastic visual experience that I recommend it to everyone on IMDb. If you haven't seen this movie already, go see it soon, you wont regret it!"
"MovieZoo","6","3","7","6 March 2009"," Watchmen: another so - so reality show
","Right up front, the fact is, this movie was just interesting. The story seems to imply that superheroes are just people too. My reaction is ""so? superheroes aren't real."" I can go to any movie knowing that any person is just a person. Am I supposed to be drawn to these superheroes because they are people? Am I supposed to suffer with them because they acted like people? Not every person is the same and not every superhero is the same. So? Can we get to something substantial please? Guess what? We do. We find out that superheroes are like people when things are good AND when things are bad!. Wow. Another lesson in life - redux.<br/><br/>The special effects were simply OK. I challenge critics of special effects in other superhero movies to give this a higher grade. Dr Manhattan and his ""fortress"" were cartoonish to a fault and should have been given more attention.<br/><br/>While some of the action was enjoyable, it usually felt gratuitous and simply distraction from the slow moving pace. I can say I did not go to this movie for action but some more would have been nice. At one point, I was even imagining Rorschach fighting Batman - that would have been fun.<br/><br/>Rorschach(Jackie Earle Haley) and Nite Owl II(Patrick Wilson) were the most interesting characters and yet were both still underused in my opinion. Malin Akerman was enjoyable as Silk Spectre II, well, because I am a person and I have person desires. While Mr Comedy has the most action, I enjoyed the action the other three provided much more.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the story somewhat for having a different take on what it can mean to be a superhero and some of the characterizations were noteworthy. For the most part, though, it felt too preachy partly because of the extensive narration. Although, in a weird way, because the narration was done by Rorschach it did lend some sincerity to the story as it is Rorschach who really is the bonding agent in the movie.<br/><br/>I know this is a confusing review but the movie itself was somewhat confusing and frustrating because it was only ""just interesting"". It gets 6/10"

","My husband and I went to see ""Watchmen"" last night and I can think of a thousand other things I would rather have done (Including wash dishes, clean the bathtub or even the toilet) for the 3 1/2 hours we wasted at the theater! We were excited, I bought the tickets online to avoid long lines or sold out show and got there early to get a good seat. The best part was the previews and ads that led up to the movie. I'll admit, I was not a comic book reader but, I have seen several other movies adapted from comic books that I really liked and would see again or have seen again already!! Spiderman, X-men, Ironman, Fantastic Four etc..... Watchmen is a horrible movie, I had to move my legs tapping my feet up and down constantly to make myself stay awake and then I just gave in and fell asleep. You spend the whole time waiting for it to get better and pick up speed but it doesn't happen. I warned people on my way out the door not to waste their money. All the nudity was so unnecessary and obnoxious. I couldn't understand how someone could make such a bad movie! We left before it was over and a couple of people followed. I could have easily left in the beginning, not caring that I was out $23.00. I've never written a movie review before because I felt it wasn't that important but I had to this time. If you want to see a good movie, go to your nearest Redbox and rent ""Appaloosa"" That would be worth spending $23.00 at the movie theater!!"

The graphics are pretty bad, and the movie is overly long besides the plot issues. Half of the movie didn't relate to the ending at all.

","There's not much else to say. Probably the most disappointing film of all time. I was really looking forward to enjoying this movie. I love comics, I love superheroes and I love action. Not only did this movie not get anywhere close to my expectations, but it actually sucked huge donkey balls.<br/><br/>There was no followable plot. There was no action. You don't care about any of the characters in it. The movie is filled with a lot of details that have no connection to the story. There is gratuitous violence that has no purpose and does nothing to help support what the director is trying to get across. On top of that, the movie is similar to a vast chasm of boring. God I can't stress that enough.... BORING! The movie is aesthetically pleasing and the actors are good. Despite not caring about any of the characters, they were at least interesting and charismatic. Other than that, whoever worked on this film should immediately be put out of their misery before they ever waste anybody else's money.<br/><br/>Who put their money up for this film? Are you the biggest retard on the planet? Did you honestly give this awful production team millions of dollars to make a film, and watched the final cut of the movie and gave a green light for release. You are an idiot. I understand a director who only thinks in aesthetics may miss having a good story and characters you hope come out on top, but someone should've said ""STOP! Let's rework this before we all make a huge mistake releasing this crap in a can and soil all of our reputations as artists!"" If Ford came out with a car this bad, they would've had a factory recall! This film should be pulled from all theaters and not released until the movie is actually releasable.<br/><br/>Hollywood has failed again and it seems to be happening more and more.

","I did not go to see Watchmen with any great enthusiasm. I am not a comic book fan, never have been (except for MAD Magazine). I truly do not understand the appeal of these poseurs of literature known as ""graphic novels""; aren't they just comic books for college boys?<br/><br/>I have enjoyed some comic book films however. I liked Iron Man, Superman Returns, and Batman Begins, but I hated both The Dark Knight and Sin City. Conversely, I liked Road To Perdition, Art School Confidential and Persepolis and they were based on graphic novels so I guess it has more to do with how a particular film is made than its fidelity to source material.<br/><br/>But there was something about the whole Watchmen phenomena that looked to me like it would be a drag for anyone not initiated into the cult and I can respect that to a point.<br/><br/>I now think that ""graphic novels'' fall into the same category as opera and NASCAR. Meaning that the people who are fans of those activities believe non-fans are all stupid. Think I'm wrong? Go ahead and make a disparaging comment about the Indy 500 in a red state or demean Tosca in a blue state, you'll get straightened out pretty quickly.<br/><br/>The fans of graphic novels simply do not understand how a person can NOT be a fan.<br/><br/>It's pretty simple really. They mostly all suck. And that includes car races and opera too.<br/><br/>Forget that I don't know the back-story on these Watchmen characters (although the film tries to get you up to speed), even if I did, I don't think I would care about them. And by that I don't mean like the characters. I would've have loved to have hated some of them, but there was nothing to them at all.<br/><br/>It's not because the actors didn't all try hard and they are a talented crew. I would have thought it impossible to make Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode and Jackie Earle Haley uninteresting, but they were. I felt bad for them.<br/><br/>They were undone by the thousand little triumphs of the other film-making departments. Like, the special effects guys who worked to get Dr. Manhattan's blue color just right, to the costume folks who got the masks perfect, the make-up people who got the prosthetics to look properly gory and all of this combined with the editing, cinematography, production design, SPFX, digital effects all the way down to the rainmakers and 3rd assistant sound editors; they all did their jobs perfectly.<br/><br/>To what end?<br/><br/>Just because you use the best ingredients, if the chef is an idiot, that soufflé ain't gonna rise.<br/><br/>So, if the 300 ""auteur"" wants to be responsible for another ""Un Film de Zack Snyder"", he should also get the blame when it doesn't work. And Watchmen doesn't work.<br/><br/>But here's a question, did anyone ask why they were making this film?<br/><br/>It's an important question. I understand film as a commercial enterprise and certainly, if Watchmen makes millions of dollars, it doesn't really matter if it sucks as badly as Life Is Beautiful or Forrest Gump, but why was this film made otherwise?<br/><br/>Other than making money (if it even does), can anyone on this film say they worked on it for any good reason other than that?<br/><br/>The fanboys will no doubt blog endlessly in the vacuums of their chat rooms about whether the film is equal to the source comic books and God Bless them for that as long as they keep to themselves and don't bother the adults, but to the filmmakers I ask; what were you trying to achieve with this film?<br/><br/>If you were trying to recreate the world of the comic books, did you succeed? What would that success have looked like on film? Or, is this like asking a Conservative what victory in Iraq would look like, knowing they haven't got the faintest idea.<br/><br/>There were some neat touches; I liked the use of the music from Koyaanisqatsi over the back-story of Dr. Manhattan. I also liked the MUZAK version of Everybody Wants To Rule The World by Tears For Fears that played underneath the attempted assassination of Adrian Veidt.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Watchmen was just a preponderance of pointless action scenes mixed with a retarded view of philosophy and science. I have not seen a film this aggressively stupid since that Ben Stein anti-evolution documentary last year. But at least Stein had the decency to be outright stupid, Watchmen might seem intellectually plausible to someone easily impressed by fuzzy thinking."

Honestly, i do not know why people rate this movie anywhere above a 4, because that's the highest it could ever get. And how this movie can even compare to the titanic ""a waste of 3 hours"" by other reviewers. I would actually watch mean girls over this, being a guy, and not homosexual. Now where to start on how awful this movie is. The acting on the most part is horrible (with the exception of the tenacious psychopath, who had an excellent actor but with the most pitiful character development I have ever seen so much that i don't even remember his name), it has a flimsy clichéd action plot line,and did i tell you? the character development is absolute ****. I swear my drama class can pull a better line of characters out of their asses doing theater ( sports than this. The lead female role especially, she and her mother's make up scene at the end was the most horrid embarrassing turd of a show i've ever seen. I understand that this is based on a much loved old school comic book, but seriously, how blind can anyone be not to see that this was a bad movie. Words can not express.

To add to the ""mystique"" the ""in the know"" geeks who read the graphic novel (code word for comic, used by men who are too old to read comics), kept promoting this movie as the mother of all comic book movies.<br/><br/>The inherent problems with this movie have been well documented here by other reviewers. The characters are undeveloped (we never end up caring what happens to anyone), the story is ridiculous (it all started with the gangs, then cops...), none of the super heroes actually have super powers (with the exception of Dr. Manhattan), laughable dialogue (the writers were more concerned with delivering one liners that could later be used by 2 of the writers of Scary Movie) and above all this movie took itself way to serious. Not even the bloody Passion of the Christ was as pretentious as this turd.<br/><br/>To say that this movie is comparable to The Dark Knight is downright slander. In fact, all of the Super Hero movies in the past year have super seeded this crap. If you end up watching this abomination and still think it is equal to the Dark Knight, then this review wasn't for you...you may fall into the below 18 male demographic. You know the type, the kind that think a smurf with his penis showing, some pseudo pornographic scenes and a few F-bombs sprinkled about for good measure add up to an edgy flick. These heroes are so weak Peter Patrelli from the current TV show would tear these J.O.'s a new one.<br/><br/>In closing, there was one character in this movie with superpowers, as previously stated, the good ole Dr. Manhattan. The man that for no reason walked around naked for a large part of the movie. The negative effect of his powers was that people close to him would develop cancer, due to the high levels of radiation he put off. If not for his acting his superpowers were transcendent of the big screen because after sitting in the theater for two hours, you'll feel like your undergoing chemotherapy."

","Are you serious? The trailers for the movie looked so awesome, but none the less I was let down hard. Wait until it is out on DVD, so you don't have to sit almost 3 hours through a never exciting, no action, comic book drama. At least if you watch it at home, you don't waste $30 dollars at the movie theater. There is no real story line, and if there is, it doesn't clearly define it at all. I mean, I saw the movie and still don't know what it was supposed to be about. Sure there is some blood and sex, but aren't comic book movies supposed to be for kids also? No wonder why the comic book writer took his name off the movie!! What's with all the big blue close ups also? Overall, big disappointment."

","As ambitious as it can be, Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" may have faithfully transplanted its source material to the big screen with all due reverence, but the overlong and overstuffed result of an intense fascination for accurate cinematic replication strips the narrative of emotional depth to mitigate the inherent shortcomings bound to constantly recur in the cinematic version of the highly lauded (and supposedly ""unfilmable"") graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Snyder's craftsmanship handsomely portrays the progression of the American society in relation to its captivation of costume-clad superheroes as exemplified by its nostalgia-tripping opening credit sequence, yet this same technical proficiency for highly stylized aesthetic, of which the director has a marked penchant for, never translates into an impelling force.<br/><br/>The stilted consequence of Snyder's overwhelming mechanisms, however, largely benefits from a premier source material that functions as a deconstruction of the superhero mythos that, through its elaborate narrative techniques, provocatively reflects on the resolute inclination of mankind to topsy-turviness. In an alternate 1985, the antagonism between the US and USSR is running at an all-time high, and Richard Nixon, serving his fifth term as the US president while basking in his dubious victory in Vietnam, has declared all superhero activities illegal. Now reduced to a vigilante, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) discovers that the Comedian (James Dean Morgan), a former superhero and colleague, has been murdered, which eventually rejoins him with other former superheroes including Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman) and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), as they learn of a binding conspiracy that spells catastrophic results.<br/><br/>Snyder's intricate sequence of events is a favorable, albeit patchy, estimate of the graphic novel's multi-parallel narrative structure that upholds dread for the inevitable self-destruction both for its corrupted protagonists and the world at large. Yet despite the almost verbatim adaptation, it's a cinematic abridgment that overall feels lethargic, highlighted to a detrimental effect by a protracted running time that jams as much material as theatrically possible. In part, it's because of its dispassionate characters that, save for Haley's monomaniacal turn as the inkblot-stained mask-wearing Rorschach, never conveys a sense of attachment; and in part, it's because of the sporadic slo-mo-induced action scenes that are less visually dynamic than in the director's previous works. It's ultimately a fanboy-pleasing replica that serves nothing else except perhaps to further provide more groundwork to the argument that the source is better than the adaptation."

Batman should file suit in Gotham small claims court. The problem with this film, as in many bad movies, is not just the bad acting and the cringe-worthy romance but the culmination or ending. The smartest man in the world supposedly has concocted one of the most needlessly complex (if he truly were smart) and ultimately ridiculous plans to ....SPOILER ALERT ... ""save"" the world not conquer or destroy it (though he does a lot of that too.) And the godlike superhero in the film...without whom the plot would not be even possible..SPOILER alert murders the righteous ""superhero"" at the end but lets the mass murder go unpunished...why? BECAUSE he agrees the his Ends justify the Means goal. We're supposed to believe that if he wipes out all of the major superpower cities then Russia and USA will become allies...but only if the god character makes them think he's always watching them. ... Ayn Rand even gets a shout out. ... We're also supposed to believe that without war or the possibility of war there is automatically no anger, strife, corruption, crime or antagonism among countries or within countries...thus making journalism unnecessary. Bottom line this movie is insulting to anyone who can think beyond their popcorn."

","I am one of the folks who really didn't have a clue about the Watchmen before giving this movie a try and I have to say that I am, at least, confused now.<br/><br/>This is clearly a film for the fans more than for a wider audience, which is basically totally fine but of course limits the audience. After two and a half hours of playtime, I still don't have any idea what exactly makes most of the characters different from the surrounding humans apart from wearing a cape. While I'm totally aware and agree that not every comic movie can recap the whole basis it is founded on because that would be pretty boring for anyone who is familiar with it already, I do believe that in such a long movie, one that is the first in its series, you should find time to at least roughly explain around what the series is settled.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" is not a bad movie by any means but honestly it's also not a great one. The milestones of the plot aren't very shocking or moving to me and the action around them is nothing that hasn't been seen in several similar films already.<br/><br/>In my opinion some of the characters do have great potential and some elements of the movie, like the score for example, were brilliantly executed.<br/><br/>Nonetheless it would be fair to make clear that people like me are not the aimed audience. A solid, but not a superb movie."

If you turn the volume up enough to be able to hear the people talking, as soon as there is an action scene the volume will be extremely loud. Too loud!

"roblesar99","10","2","4","8 August 2014"," An Underrated Graphic Novel Masterpiece
","Director Zack Snyder did the impossible when he made ""Watchmen"". The critically acclaimed 1980s graphic novel the film is based off had been once been deemed ""unfilmable."" As I myself had read the graphic novel beforehand, I wondered how the complex and layered storyline of the novel would translate onto the screen. But as the end credits rolled before my eyes, I realized that my worries had been nonsensical, for Snyder had created one of the best superhero films of all time.<br/><br/>Before I go any further into my review, I must say that I fully recommend reading the graphic novel first. It makes the film infinitely better and one is able to catch many small details throughout the film. Another recommendation I make is watching the Director's Cut (which I did for the review) or The Ultimate Cut. They both contain more scenes from the graphic novel, including the death of a notable character.<br/><br/>Now, as I continue with my review, I must applaud the film's soundtrack. Featuring tracks such as Nat King Cole's ""Unforgettable"" and Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"", ""Watchmen""'s soundtrack is fantastic and one-of-a- kind, considering that fact that it's for a comic book movie. An opening credits scene set to the tune of Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" is downright incredible as well.<br/><br/>The majority of the performances deserve praise as well. Jackie Earle Haley gives the performance of a lifetime as the vigilante Rorschach. After watching his performance, I can't imagine anyone else wearing the ever-changing inkblot mask. Patrick Wilson and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are superb as Nite Owl II and The Comedian. Billy Crudup and Malin Akerman also do a great job bringing their characters, Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre II to life. However, if the film does have a minor flaw, it's the casting of Matthew Goode in the role of Ozymandias. He is in no way bad, but sometimes lacks the screen presence that the world's smartest man commands.<br/><br/>However, we now move on the plot, which unlike most adaptations, has remained mostly intact on film. The changes that have been made (particularly in the final act) do not hinder the film, and are ultimately for the better. Some of the graphic novel's content is just too weird for the big screen, but the changes made keep the spirit. In fact, I would dare say that ""Watchmen"" is one of the most faithful adaptations I've ever seen. Although I feared that some of the best scenes from the graphic novel might not have included for whatever reason, the scenes were all there, and just as thrilling. If you've read the graphic novel, the plot keeps you just as enthralled, as the mystery is slowly uncovered.<br/><br/>Props must again be given to Zack Snyder for doing the impossible and bringing the world of Alan Moore's fantastic graphic novel to life. The approaching peak of the Cold War and the countdown of the Doomsday Clock give the film a sense of background tension that stays with us until the conclusion closes. The world is interesting and visually striking, as it imagines a world where superheroes have existed for nearly 50 years. In the same way that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons made ""Watchmen"" appear unique and unlike any other graphic novel, Snyder has done the same thing with the film, making it stand out in a crowded genre.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" is, without a doubt, Zack Snyder's masterpiece. A masterful adaptation of an already superb graphic novel, ""Watchmen"" is unlike no other superhero movie. Deftly blending an iconic soundtrack with a complex, layered plot featuring some great performances and some visceral action sequences, ""Watchmen"" is one of the greatest superhero films out there.<br/><br/>And yet, even five years after its release, ""Watchmen"" is still massively underrated. If you've already seen ""The Dark Knight"" and you're looking for a thought-provoking film that has people dressed up in costumes, than look no further. ""Watchmen"" is your best bet.<br/><br/>10/10"
"adrongardner","5","2","4","11 May 2014"," Large order of Snyder, hold the Apocaloctopus
","It walks and talks like Watchmen, but somehow this is not Watchmen<br/><br/>Look I'm no defender of Zack Snyder - I'm not sure if he's ever made a good movie at all. But as a distant fan of the original story, against all complaints and bias I really wanted this movie to succeed.<br/><br/>It doesn't.<br/><br/>There are a lot of arguments to be made, the biggest is naturally - Can Watchmen even translate to a movie? The question goes unanswered. If there is a good Watcmen movie to be made, this absolutely is NOT it.<br/><br/>A person could sit down with a checklist as Snyder's Watcmen unfolds and click off all the things from the original story that should be in this movie. Well low and behold, just about everything is in there, of course omitting the Apocalyptic Octopus. Believe it or not, I didn't even mind about the ending, but somehow, it's all pantomime and with the exception of two unquestionably fantastic performances, the end product is utterly soulless and thoroughly vapid.<br/><br/>It's hard to pinpoint what went wrong because the cast is almost there. I really have to applaud most of the players, particularly Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Unfortunately Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson aren't up to snuff and I never bought into their characters. Top it off that they are saddled with a laughably terrible sex scene - sure it's ""in the book"" - but seemingly feels recycled from Snyder's 300 with crappier music.<br/><br/>If I was some great Captain Hindsight, I could point out everything Snyder did wrong. But I can't do it. Just like the graphic novel, this all reads great on paper, but what's on screen is just unbelievably boring and forgettable. Alan Moore created a real allegorical page turner with Watchmen, but on screen, this is just a snoozer. <br/><br/>Is it terrible? No, but there's really no downside to not watching it."
"tomgillespie2002","6","2","4","7 May 2014"," When it's good, it's great, when it's bad, it's embarrassing
","Bringing Alan Moore's cerebral and sprawling novel to the screen was always going to a near-impossible task. It's very much an anti-superhero story, where the 'heroes' are merciless psychopaths, government weapons of mass destruction, or sexually impotent. Spanning decades and featuring snippets from books, comics and newspaper reports within the world Moore creates, any film adaptation simply could not match the level of details and authenticity of the much-lauded novel. Zack Snyder, a fan of the original, and a director who was just off the back of the surprisingly excellent Dawn of the Dead (2004) and the shouty, crass 300 (2006), puts all of his heart and soul into Watchmen.<br/><br/>Using a no-name cast, a convoluted and dangerously slow story, and an adult rating thanks to all those snapped bones and a massive blue willy, it's a wonder this ever got made at all. It was in development hell for years, with names such as Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass becoming attached and then quickly detached from the project, and even the nerve-jangling possibility of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the movie's only true superhero was banded around in the mid 1990's. It's almost impossible to think of a more faithful adaptation than Snyder's, often re-creating frames from the comic in the minutest of detail, and even including Tales from the Black Freighter, the comic- within-a-comic from the novel with the voice of Gerard Butler (this is a review of the 215- minute cut, which I feel is the best version out there). Yet, you could still argue that Moore's book is un-filmable. <br/><br/>The 1980's, and President Nixon is running his fourth term in office, and superheroes have been outlawed. Ageing government assassin The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a former member of two superhero groups named the Minutemen, is murdered in his home. Vigilante and wanted man Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) investigates the murder, and brings his theory that someone is hunting down retired superheroes to his friend and former partner Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson), formerly known as the White Owl. With the threat of nuclear war with the Soviets becoming frequently more inevitable, heads turn to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a neo-God with the ability to bend matter to his will. But when he learns that he may have given his friends and loved ones cancer, he flees to Mars, leaving the world vulnerable to complete annihilation.<br/><br/>The Watchmen world is thick and meaty, re-writing history as if masked heroes and super-villains actually existed. In the film's opening titles, we are treated to an impressive collage of famous historical events, such as the Moon landing, but here it's Dr. Manhattan photographing Neil Armstrong. It's a hell of a lot of back-story to fill in, and the movie spends most of it's time filling in the gaps between the 1940's and the 1980's. Luckily, the characters Alan Moore wrote so beautifully, are fascinating, and the extended segments dedicated to portray their personal evolution are arguably more interesting than the movie's main plot. These are not flawed superheroes like Batman or Wolverine, they are complete f**k-ups, getting sexual stimulation from violence, battering minor offenders to a bloody pulp, or, in Dr. Manhattan's case, literally losing every trace of his humanity.<br/><br/>Moore's novel made them a parody of the idea of masked superheroes protecting the weak. The Comedian especially is a piece of work, gleefully frying a Viet Cong with a flame thrower, while a giant Dr. Manhattan stalks the jungle vaporising any enemies in his way, helicopters whizzing by his head while 'Ride of the Valkyries' plays. Like with 300, Snyder way overplays it. The comic itself wasn't exactly subtle, but Watchmen the movie amps everything up to 11, and while this admittedly makes the film more exciting, it makes the themes heavy- handed and sometimes plain laughable. Dreiberg can only get it up for the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) after he's murdered some criminals, but when he finally does, Snyder captures it like a soft-core porn movie starring Shannon Tweed, with the cringe-worthy use of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' in the background. In fact, the entire soundtrack feels as if it's been picked by some stoner student with Jimi Hendrix posters on his wall.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that, after a very successful opening week, Watchmen plummeted once word-of-mouth got around. Audiences drawn in by the possibility of another superhero spectacle were no doubt left baffled by the existential musings of it's characters and the extreme darkness of the film's themes. Perhaps it was what the film deserved, as when it's good, it's the work of a true artist, and when it's bad, it's quite embarrassing. But it's the best that us fans are likely to ever get, and we must be thankful that a director who really knows and loves the source was on board, and insistent that it wasn't destroyed by the studio butchers. Snyder has also rounded up an excellent cast, with Haley and Crudup standing out especially (Akerman suffers from some dodgy delivery occasionally but she sure pulls off that costume). It will continue to divide it's viewers, but it'll be somewhat cherished by it's fans."
"Goodfellasz","9","2","4","13 April 2014"," Underrated
","In my country this movie didn't last long in the cinemas, so the first time I saw this movie it was on DVD. I had been attracted to the story and after a first viewing I was blown away by the CGI, acting performances and the story. <br/><br/>Personally I still believe that this movie remains underrated (even after five years there are only two graphic novel/comic book adaptations that are superior to this movie and these are sin city and the dark knight). Watchmen gives a raw perspective on the lives of different vigilantes. The mixture between the rather unknown actors (and not blockbuster actors) and the perfect CGI makes this movie so great. Add an incredible soundtrack to this mixture and you're in for one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>Personally I have seen both the theatrical version as the director's cut and I have tried to watch the ultimate cut. It must be said that the first two versions are very good to near perfect (especially the director's cut adds some very beautiful scenes to the movie). If you're watching this movie for the first time though it might be better to watch the theatrical cut because most people don't like three hour movies. Personally I prefer the director's cut, but that's only because I'm a huge fan of the movie and prefer a longer version of the story. The ultimate cut though is not for everyone, I have tried to watch this version but had to stop. This version adds the story 'Tales of the Black Freightner' and because this story is an animation 'movie' every scene that is added from this picture forms a kind of a fracture with the main (watchmen) storyline. I think that the ultimate cut is only for the real die hard fans of watchmen (and especially of the graphic novel).<br/><br/>Overall I think that Watchmen should be seen by everyone because it's one of the few successful hero-stories that doesn't show a hope-giving picture of these men and women but that tells a real dramatical series of events."
"illbebackreviews","4","2","4","17 June 2013"," Watchmen is yet another overrated 2009 film
","Watchmen joins Avatar and Up into a list of most overrated films of the year. Zack Synder provides what is considered a faithful adaptation of the comic, Watchmen in an extremely dark, gritty and surprisingly slow way.<br/><br/>Watchmen tells the story of a group of people who vowed to protect their city as Roscharch (Jackie Earl Haley) goes on an investigation following the death of one of the Watchmen.<br/><br/>I found a problem with Watchmen in its pacing which can simply be described as, inconsistent. At times, the film is intriguing yet at other times, it drags along providing nothing engaging. The story itself is overly dark and attempts to visually look impressive, like most Synder films do. The script is rather well written, has some impressive dialogue but the overall execution of the story is where this film ultimately fails for me.<br/><br/>A film with a 3 hour duration needs many things to keep audiences engaged: great characters, a fascinating story all throughout and a well paced story. The characters in this film certainly have plenty of depth in them...but perhaps a bit too much making them rather difficult to follow a first time. The story itself is at times, overly complicated and at other times, presented as a straightforward story. Whilst great to see that Synder can add depth into a film, it is also difficult to take in as much depth as he provides. The story, at times dull and at times intriguing comes off inconsistent, poorly directed and poorly written.<br/><br/>The performances however are great and realistic, providing some good things for the film. That said, the film as a whole simply didn't connect with me. That said, it is most likely to connect to comic book fans as it provides some great action sequences and a deep story, telling us that it is a well adapted film"
"redx1708","10","2","4","11 May 2013"," What a great movie !!!
","Just picked this up the other day from the cheap offers at the DVD store. I seemed to recall that it had gotten some good reviews when it came out, so i figured it would be good to kill a few hours with on my day off. I must admit i never read the graphic novel. Actually i've never heard of the Watchmen, so i didn't really know what to expect. So having no prejudice as to how the movie was compared to the GN, i can just take it at face value, and in my opinion this is not just the best superhero movie ever made, but a movie masterpiece in its own right. I liked the X-Men movies, and Nolan did a great job with Batman, but this is so completely different that it doesn't compare at all. It's not just a superhero story, but a story about what's right and wrong, and can wrong be right ? Does the end justify the Means ? Food for thought. OK, so the acting may be a Little stiff here and there, but it didn't bother me at all, since the Visuals, the music and the Whole concept worked so well. Add to that some dry humor and comments to the Cold war period and what more can you ask ? What a great movie !!!<br/><br/>PS:
Actually went out and bought the graphic novel, and i can see why some had complaints about the movie making changes to the story. However this always happens when they adapt books or comix into movies, and while they left out some stuff and changed the ending, they still managed to get the message across.
Nothing gets people to stand together as a common foe. So i think that the movie stands very well on its own beside the GN, and my rating stands as well."

","Even by the standards of superhero movies, Watchmen is preposterous.<br/><br/>It's very pleasing on the eye with its handsome, elaborately-clad cast and abundance of visual effects. <br/><br/>However, I could identify with precisely none of the characters, most of which were no more than padding. Padding is OK in movies which are fundamentally sound but this one simply isn't. It's as if the writers started with a suite of visual effects and a bunch of makeup artists, then said ""right, what can we do with all this stuff"".<br/><br/>Initially, you may feel you are watching something worthwhile but Watchmen doesn't stand repeat viewing. Once you've stopped gawking at the effects, and start asking ""why?"", then disillusion is likely to set in.<br/><br/>By all means watch Watchmen as a visual spectacle, but for goodness sake turn the sound off to avoid being nauseated and exasperated by the flimsy plot and the totally insubstantial ending. <br/><br/>One to sort of enjoy once, then avoid like the plague."

","During every year, Hollywood makes dozens of movies which in most cases are, well, how can I put this... disgusting.<br/><br/>I'm glad to announce, Watchmen didn't make that list. For the grand audience and judging for the discussions i had with some friends, watchmen was either too long or with too many special effects.<br/><br/>It disappoints me that most of people doesn't see beyond that. Watchmen is so much more than special effects and utopic characters. Watchmen is a painting of an era, an almost perfect demonstration of a way of thinking. It doesn't just illustrates a comic book, it also represents a generation.<br/><br/>And that is proved in so many ways. From the music background, where there's the impressive scene following the comedian's death where there are shown a series of events of American history, with the iconic Bob Dylan playing in the background, to an illustration of USA's government mentality during the cold war, passing through the street's of Manhattan, represented in a scene where a boy sits beside a street magazine shop, just reading a comic book like there's nothing around him.<br/><br/>I got to say it was disappointing for me to see a rating of only 7.6 when this film deserves at least an 8. It's one of the most enjoyable movies i've watched in a long time, and besides the almost 3 hours i spent watching it, i gladly assume i wouldn't have spent them doing anything else."
"lordjord96","8","2","4","23 November 2012"," Who watches the Watchmen? I DO!
","Watchmen is one of those films where you need to find a day where you have NOTHING planned, and then sit down and watch it. This film requires a heck of a lot of concentration. Being 2 hours and 40 minutes long means it isn't the longest film out there by any standards, but the pacing is a tad slow for most people (including myself) and so getting through it may be a bit of a pain unless you have nothing else to do.<br/><br/>I shall start with what I always start with; Director and actors. The actors in this film are, of course, top notch. Jackie Earle Haley as 'Rauschach' worked beautifully. His dark and mysterious tone suits the character perfectly. Dr. Manhattan was also brilliantly played by Billy Crudup as a very cold and unmovable genius was superb. The ensemble is good all round. The best part of the ensemble is, of course, Zack Snyder. Having loved the beautiful cinematography, well-paced and gripping story of '300', I expected great things from this film, and he delivered in most circumstances.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is exceptional. The intro is stunning, and merits as possibly on of the best of all time, and the general atmosphere of cold-war America, tainted by violence and the fear of nuclear war, feels eerily possible. Just brilliant. Every blaze of yellow looks great, every shining blue person is a great addition to the overall feel of the film.<br/><br/>The plot is great, apart from one small thing; the pace. It just seems that the action culminates far too late, which makes the ending a bit iffy. Yes, it works and looks great, but the execution just leaves you thinking ""WAAAAAAAA... oh, that it?"". Not very good considering the outstanding nature of 300.<br/><br/>Therefore, I cannot put this film up there with my favourites. It looks superb, and has some brilliant acting not to mention the label of a brilliant director on it. It is all brought down a bit though by the poor pacing. I simply could not watch this film twice, in a year even. 8.3/10, a noble effort at such a grand concept."
"RecurringNightmare","9","2","4","23 June 2011"," You don't have to be a comic fan to like this!
","I have read that if you're not already a fan of the comic book, you won't like the movie. I have never heard of the comic, I never had any interest in comics, and have never owned a comic. But I liked this movie.<br/><br/>This is far from a typical comic story that are so prevalent today. There is very gritty violence, interesting, dark characters, real emotions, and great effects as well as quite a complex story. What I suppose impressed me the most is that these super heroes weren't really heroes at all. Most of them were more like villains, and their powers were, with the exception of Dr. Manhattan, rather unremarkable. Most of them seemed to have pretty impressive, slightly inhuman strength, or speed, but beyond that, they were just people in your typical superhero outfits.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan was refreshing in that having incredible, unbelievable powers, he had totally lost his touch on human reality and actually said that living and dead matter were really no different since they were structurally the same. Awesome example of weirdness there.<br/><br/>I saw it more as an alternative super hero story than the x-men, spiderman type stories, and I like it a lot more because of it."
"nEoFILM","10","2","4","2 February 2011"," Director's Cut
","I first watched the theatrical cut back in 2009 and though I was impressed, I knew that it required a second viewing to be judged fairly. This didn't happen until a couple of months ago when I was treated to the Director's Cut, a version extended by approximately 25 minutes.<br/><br/>The funny thing about this cut is that it is hard to see the joins, which is obviously very good, as a lot of special editions have scenes shoehorned in and held together with sellotape. But this was a smooth three hour epic, not so much redefining the genre but demonstrating how indeed, it can be done.<br/><br/>That in many ways was my problem the first time, that I was expecting more thrills and spills often associated with the comic genre, but was given an intellectual, character drama, played and directed so very well, that it is hard to peg this in to any particular slot. This is primarily a drama, and as such, is light on action but heavy on emotion and melodrama.<br/><br/>The cinematography is well conceived, though the whole film plays out in a relatively and surprisingly classical manner, sometimes at odds with story and visuals which they are showcasing.<br/><br/>The action, though brutal and at times rightly so, is showcasing the brutality of vigilantism, and at others, leading into a splatter territory. But on repeat viewings this holds up and once you accept that it is what it is, then this is a first class film, as well as a crackingly smooth director's cut, expanding the 153 minute version with ease, adding a few scenes to gain more context, and others snugly fitting into the original mold.<br/><br/>This is a fully developed adaptation of an iconic graphic novel from the 1980′s, though in that sense it is lacking some of the context of that day, but still resonates in many others. I would not have known much about this story if it had not been adapted for the screen and this is a faithful one, but I can understand the view of those who say that it is 'too' faithful, as this could have done well to employ a little more theatrical license, maybe sacrificing some of the accuracy in favor of the truth of the story.<br/><br/>In the end, this is what it is, and it is something special and I believe, potentially timeless"

","After watching series of disappointing superheros movies, Watchmen was a breath of fresh air. The plot is interesting, captivating and all things considering rather interesting. The heroes act and live in real world with all its issues and problems. Nuclear annihilation is looming upon everybody in the world, the problems are serious and the stakes are high. The characters are true to themselves and to the script, they have dark sides and the world is not black and white like in every other superhero movie. The movie shows us the glimpses of the past and how it is affecting the present behavior of the characters. Dr. Manhattan is slowly loosing its humanity and has no interest in humankind. Ozymandias end up saving the human race from itself but. Rorschach unbending princeliness shows us what it means to be a true superhero. I hope that Hollywood would make more of this kind of movies rather then Spiderman 3. I would love to see more of Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre as well."

"jfcthejock","9","2","4","28 November 2010"," A Strong Visual Adaptation of A Comic That Follows A New Trend of Superheroes
","Now personally I have never read the Watchmen comics, being I was to young too and that i've never really been a comic lover. However this film adaption of the comic seems to me a very well done one, and follows like a few Marvel adaptations and also 300. Watchmen incorporates a new trend of superheroes and that is the torn, damaged, and very human superhero. Someone more realistic, and obviously does not have superpowers but does wield training and equipment that allows them to be heroes to the world.<br/><br/>Watchmen follows a different time line, and of course a parallel universe that sees the 1980's pan out a lot different to how they really did. Nixon is still in power, the stand-off between the USA and the Soviet Union is at a boiling point that is nuclear war on the horizon and obviously the end of the world. Afar from the plot of the film, I can greatly appreciate the amount of work, funding and scope given to this epic project. The cast was brilliant and worked well alongside each other on the screen, special effects were top notch and were not cheap looking in which would have made the film also feel cheap.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has done a great job of adapting quite a great but difficult to adapt comic into a film, maybe to some its not what Watchmen should be but its certainly at least close to the truth. At over three hours long, you have to have the threshold of patience to really enjoy this film and open your mind to a new world in the film. For some this is a hard task to do, and for others its just impossible and so it is for the patient group of film goers to enjoy. If you persist its a worthy reward, a dazzling world parallel to our own and also shows us the deep seated fear and paranoia of the Cold War period. How everyone feared their neighbour was a Communist or Soviet sympathiser. <br/><br/>Its also to me, a new look at superheroes. Not those of the Marvel world who have powers and seem to always save the day, but everyday men and women who with training and equipment at their hands are able to at least try to stem crime and corruption. Watchmen is not for children obviously, and so its for a mature viewer with its content but also its scope. Watchmen makes a insightful film to watch, and also just one to let your mind open to on a Saturday night. Cast:9/10 Special Effects: 9/10"
"talkymeat","7","2","4","6 May 2010"," Not Bad, but Please read the Graphic Novel it's much, much Better
","Watchmen centers around a variety of very human super heroes. After a death of a common friend, they all must meet up again and try and unearth a possible criminal plot.<br/><br/>Watchmen is not a complete waste. This is a very faithful adaptation of the Stellar Grahpic Novel, but it manages to loose most of the life of the book. The characters are fairly interesting and unlike most super heroes but as a movie of the book and as a movie in general it isn't particularly great. The only thing that saves it from complete failure is the quality of the subject matter is is based on.<br/><br/>It becomes clear very early that Zack Snyder was not the right man for this job. Virtually all he did was directly put most of the graphic novel onto the screen with no directing technique and then what he added/changed was very weird or just plain bad. If you saw 300 you understand his method of directing: Slow down violence to make it really cool and meaningful. Unfotunately all this does it make it seem very melodramatic and out of place. If the material he were adapting weren't so good he would have completely blown it (Again, 300). But, I do have to give him credit for how little he changed, and for the most part he cut out what he should have.<br/><br/>The acting is kind of a mix bag. At times it's decent(Jackie Earle Haley) at other times it's awful (Malin Ackerman). So I wouldn't say the acting is out right bad, but it's certainly not Oscar worthy. But it's not always the actors' fault, I found some of the casting to be outright mind boggling: Matthew Goode as Ozymandis (WHAT?). I found Patrick Wilson to be a little to young and skinny to be Night Owl as well.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to be that objective as I read the book first, but this movie just doesn't seem to get the same meaning and feeling as the graphic novel did. It doesn't appear that Snyder took appropriate time and care in making this a very cohesive movie. Many scenes seem very out of place and some are just ridiculous (Richard Nixon anyone?). The violence seemed gratuitous and unnecessary oftentimes, as did the sex scene.<br/><br/>So, if your never going to read the graphic novel then see this just so you know the story as it is very interesting and original. But I implore you Please, Please, Please read the graphic novel."

","After watching the movie three times, it still leaves me underwhelmed. I've not seen the book nor had I ever heard of it previously. If the movie is true to the original story, I think I would have probably not finished it. There's a reward at the end of the movie but very little up to that point. <br/><br/>I kept forcing myself to watch a little further thinking that I was going to miss out on some high point and it just never really happened. I found myself actually watching birds on the feeder without knowing that my attention had been lost.<br/><br/>I guess if I were to tell a friend about the movie, I'd say, watch it for the effects but if there's another movie on another channel that you've heard good things about, switch and only come back when you have some time to kill. ...A lot of time at 2 hours and 41 minutes."
"Ziya90","9","2","4","15 February 2010"," After a second view, it just grows on you
","Watchmen has some fresh material that no comic book adaptation dared, so a kind of revolution, but there are some problems in it that make the movie a hard and less entertaining experience. In other words, it is related to you. It is like if your viewpoint about cinema, comic books or super heroes is the same with Alan Moore, Watchmen will be your movie, but if you are interested in rather cinema, entertainment, then it will turn into a hard experience. Mostly, the development of the events makes the movie less engaging, gripping and less entertaining. Visually, Watchmen is very well, dark, but at the same time colorful, some images are dazzling, the plot is astonishing, because inventive and smart, but somehow, there is lack of impressive material (except for Rorschach?) I don't know why, but Watchmen recalls me Sin City, another revolution in cinema. I have not read the comic book of Watchmen yet, but as the people said, the movie is very loyal to the comic book, even some of them say the most loyal adaptation so far. As for the innovations, in Watchmen, super heroes are not as pure as snow, especially The Comedian and Dr. Manhattan. One kills or hurts innocent people and enjoy doing that, the other does not care about humanity and he kills innocent people either. This is also the first movie which we see toys of some super heroes which is good. The movie has some social and political subtexts, it has some great one- liners... A corrupt and decayed world, life and death, a little philosophy, Watchmen has all those and more, but somehow it leaves a ""funny"" taste in your mouth. It seems that some critics and the people who are like Alan Moore don't complain about lack of action or lack of tension or slight entertainment etc. but the poster, the characters, the story prepare you for action and excitement, but the comic book is not about that, so by the loyalty of Snyder, we see a different movie than we had expected. By the way, the movie has some action, don't get me wrong. However, also there are some bizarre and raw violent scenes which I have no idea about. Good news for the people who like such kind of stuff, but that scene which they fight a group of gang was too much! Very luckily, there are not many slow motion shots in Watchmen in comparison with 300, Snyder uses the camera greatly here. By the way, I did not complain about the sex scene at all, unbelievably, many people talk about this and say it was awful, bizarre. It was just a scene, not good, not bad, if you ask me. Yes, as some people think too, the character who 'shoulders' the movie was Rorschach, he has become my favorite character from the movie. A sort of, he recalls Sin City's Marv also. His adventures, his ""face"", a very interesting character from the world of Watchmen. The other characters, especially Dr. Manhattan are interesting too, but Rorschsach was like the only character gets the movie move. However, these are not the things that the fans of the comic book want to discuss (remember, it changes according to what you are interested in) The parts he appears are the most appealing parts of the movie. There are some further problems either. Patrick Wilson is one of the most weird choices for that character or why they used plastic make up for Nixon? I haven't seen, but Frank Langella would be very good. The parts that take place in the huge station/base were uninspiring and a bit cliché and also recently we saw a similar one in Hellboy II. Despite all these things, I appreciate Snyder, because he is an auteur, he has his own style, he is not one of those ""incumbent directors""."
"smr1223","7","2","4","14 January 2010"," ""Watchmen"" is one deliciously dark super psychosis!!!
","The story takes place in an alternate world in which masked, costumed vigilantes fight crime in America, originally in response to a rise in masked and costumed gangs and criminals. In the 1930s and '40s, the vigilantes formed a group called the Minutemen to ""finish what the law couldn't."" Of the eight Minutemen, three died violently, one disappeared, and one was committed to an asylum. Decades later, a second generation of ""superheroes"" attempts to form a similar team called the Watchmen. By the 1980s, however, the Watchmen have been outlawed by Congress after an outpouring of anti-vigilante sentiment in the country, and tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union have escalated the Cold War with threats of nuclear war.<br/><br/>By 1985, only three Watchmen remain active: the Comedian, Doctor Manhattan(Billy Crudup), both of whom act with government sanction, and the masked vigilante sociopath Rorschach(expertly played by Jackie Earle Haley), who refuses to retire and remains active illegally. Investigating the murder of government agent Edward Blake(Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Rorschach discovers that Blake was the Comedian, and concludes that someone may be trying to eliminate the Watchmen. He attempts to warn his retired comrades—his former partner Daniel Dreiberg (Nite Owl II), the emotionally detached Dr. Jonathan Osterman (Doctor Manhattan), and Dr. Manhattan's lover Laurie Jupiter (the Silk Spectre II). Dreiberg is skeptical, but nonetheless relays the hypothesis to billionaire brainiac Adrian Veidt. (Ozymandias), who dismisses it.<br/><br/>After Blake's funeral, Dr. Manhattan is accused of causing the cancers afflicting his former girlfriend and others who spent time with him after the scientific accident that gave him superpowers. Dr. Manhattan exiles himself to Mars, giving the Soviet Union the confidence to invade Afghanistan in his absence. Later, Rorschach's conspiracy theory appears to be justified when Veidt, who had long since made his identity as Ozymandias public before retiring, narrowly avoids an assassination attempt, and Rorschach finds himself framed for murder.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Jupiter, after breaking up with Manhattan, goes to stay with Dreiberg, and the two former superheroes come out of retirement as they grow closer. After they break Rorschach out of prison, Silk Spectre(the beautiful Malin Akerman) is confronted by Dr. Manhattan. He takes her to Mars and, after she asks him to save the world, explains he is no longer interested in humanity. As he probes her memories, it is discovered that the Comedian was her father. His interest in humanity renewed by this improbable sequence of events, Manhattan returns to Earth with the Silk Spectre.<br/><br/>Investigating the conspiracy, Rorschach and Nite Owl(Patrick Wilson) discover that Veidt is behind everything. Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal, which he drops off at a newspaper office. Rorschach and Nite Owl confront Veidt, dressed once more in his Ozymandias costume, at his Antarctic retreat. Ozymandias(Matthew Goode) confirms he is the mastermind behind the Comedian's murder, Manhattan's exile, and the framing of Rorschach; he also staged his own assassination attempt to place himself above suspicion. He explains that his plan is to unify the United States and the Soviet Union and to prevent nuclear war by destroying the world's main cities with exploding energy reactors he helped Doctor Manhattan create under the pretense of providing free energy for the world. Rorschach and Nite Owl attempt to stop him, but Ozymandias easily beats them. Ozymandias then reveals that his plan has already been set into motion: the reactors have been detonated, and the energy signatures are recognized as Manhattan's.<br/><br/>The Silk Spectre and Doctor Manhattan arrive at the ruins of New York City and determine that it must be Veidt's work. They teleport to the Antarctic retreat to confront him, but Ozymandias turns on a news report in which President Nixon states that the US and Soviets have allied against their ""common enemy,"" Manhattan. The heroes are completely helpless to stop it and realize that revealing the conspiracy would only disrupt this peace. Only Rorschach is unwilling to remain silent and, at his own urging, is vaporized by a reluctant Manhattan. Manhattan shares a final kiss with Jupiter and departs for another galaxy.<br/><br/>With the end of the Cold War and the uniting of humanity, Jupiter and Dreiberg return to New York City as it's being rebuilt to begin a new life together. The film closes with a newspaper editor in New York complaining of having nothing worthwhile to print because of the worldwide peace. He tells a young employee that he may print whatever he likes from a collection of crank mailings, among which lies Rorschach's journal.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" is not kid-friendly due to the graphic violence, attempted rape, & extremely sinister mood. Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach is deliciously disturbed as well as Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre II is sexy. Very much in the ""Sin City"" genre, ""Watchmen"" is more than a superhero saga; it is a deep, dark peek into the psychosis of ordinary men & women thrust into extraordinary action with dire consequences. Definitely worth a look!!!"

","The spoilers in this review are minor, but they are spoilers. This is not really a review in a sense that it is more of a defensive argument against the many negative comments about this movie, coming from the divided reviews.<br/><br/>The biggest thing people have complained about with this film is that it's 163 minutes long, a near three hours. Now being a fan of movies that are long, because they give more character and story development, I can say I had no problem, but the reason why I'm defending this is because this is how long it is supposed to be to get the whole story out. Hell, there's a Director's Cut (which I've seen) that's 184 minutes and there's an even longer cut that just came out. So if you don't preferred the running time now, remember it could have been longer.<br/><br/>Another thing that has been said so much is about the character of Dr. Manhattan and the fact that he is nude most of the time he's on screen. For one thing, it is in the graphic novel, so if you have a problem go argue with the guys who wrote the graphic novel and not the filmmakers who adapted it. Plus, it's been mentioned many times that Manhattan has lost his touch with the human race, and therefore, he wouldn't have the need for clothes. And the thing (and I'm not addressing it to everyone) that I find hypocritical is that it's frightening to show the male sex organ, but it's okay to show boobies or occasional female frontal nudity. If you can't handle it, then that's your problem.<br/><br/>And the slow motion has been complained over in this film and in director Zack Snyder's previous film 300. People hate this more than I hate bugs. For one thing, the slow motion was not used in every scene and while it is used, the action is still very fluent and lacks the use of wires. Besides, that's his style of film making. If you want to see bad slow motion, go watch Max Payne.<br/><br/>And some people have even complained about the violence and sex in this movie. Need I remind you that this is an R rated film, and it's that way for a reason. And if you're one of those people that takes they're kids to see movies you want to see without looking at the rating system and the parental guide, you should change that or you shouldn't go see movies at all.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think that the film is a masterpiece, and I don't understand people who bash this film. Sure it isn't Schindler's List, sure it isn't The Godfather, but it's still directed brilliantly and in time, maybe some people will accept it more. It still remains my favorite of the year (even though UP is the best), and the director's cut is even better."
"kelsogw","5","2","4","4 November 2009"," Not as Good as the Graphic Novel
","Before watching this movie I read the graphic novel; I enjoyed the novel thoroughly, and cringed at the film. I probably would have hated this movie, if I haven't read the graphic novel, but like Twilight fans I was seduced by the characters and the anticipation of the plot. Although unlike Twilight fans, I have decided to take a breather before writing a movie review, which unfortunately can't be said for the angry Twilight review I just wrote earlier.<br/><br/>The Watchmen proved to be mediocre at best which reflects in the rating above. Like with most comic book movies there's the good, the bad and the ugly. So let's begin with the good: I liked the opening credits A lot very visually appealing and much better than the actual film AND Rorschach, played by Jackie Earl Haley (also by me on Halloween :)) The Bad: Adrian Veidt, played by Mathew Goode, bad casting really ""grinds my gears"", just watch Channing Tatum as Duke, in She's the man.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The sex scene on the airship. I wish I was able to watch this movie with both my dad and my younger siblings, but unfortunately it's both awkward and inappropriate. It's really a shame that comic book films don't keep in mind the younger and even older audiences. Of course like all action films they go by the basic templates; sex and violence. If it was done well, or even if it was brief I might have been able to stand it, but unfortunately it was neither. It didn't help that before that one there were two previous ones as well. I know it is being true to the graphic novel, but they left out a lot more interesting scenes to throw in that one instead.<br/><br/>MY REVIEW: SEE IT, IT WON'T HURT, BUT NOT WITH YOUR KIDs OR PARENTS. Although I suggest reading the book first."
"tburke85","6","2","4","24 July 2009"," Watchmen A Decent Movie Based On A Graphic Novel
","Let me first start off by saying I've never read any of the Watchmen comics but I thought it was a decent movie based on a graphic novel from director Zack Snyder the man behind films like 300 and the Dawn Of The Dead remake. Snyder does a good job with his attempt to bring this graphic novel to the big screen but a slow pace, the lack of some character development, and overlong running time hurt it the most. Watchmen wasn't the best film I've ever seen but it certainly wasn't the worst either Shutter and The Happening to name a few. The movie takes place in an alternate 1985 America where costumed superheroes are a part of everyday society and tensions with the Soviets maybe leading to a third world war or worse. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre 2, Mathew Goode as Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl 2. The three stand outs in the cast are Jackie Earle Haley who turns in a great performance as Walter Kovacs/Rorschach as a determined psychotic masked vigilante whose on a quest for the truth. Billy Crudup is equally impressive as Jon Osterman a scientist who becomes the emotionally distant Dr Manhattan after a bizarre accident turns into a blue superhuman god with amazing powers and the same can go to Jefrrey Dean Morgan as Eddie Blake/The Comedian a twisted cigar smoking psychopathic vigilante whose death kicks off the movie. Morgan isn't in it that much but he's effective in the small role. The rest of the supporting cast including Carla Cugino as Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre 1, Matt Frewer Edgar Jacobi/Moloch, and Stephen Hattie as Hollis Mason/Nite Owil are okay in their extended appearances but none of them are developed enough like Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan, Dan Drieberg, or Laurie Jupiter. The actor who played Richard Nixon was all right but I think they went over the top with him especially with his nose. People expecting a lot of action maybe be disappointed because there is enough of it but this film seemed to be more about the story which isn't necessarily a bad thing I guess. The action/fight sequences the movie does have are well executed none the less but nothing we haven't really seen before. The eventual twist as to the identity of the one who killed the Comedian I sort of saw coming but you might not. The sex scene between Wilson and Ackerman is steamy but it felt kind of unnecessary and the music playing while they're doing it didn't match at all. But Ackerman still looked great in either a leather outfit or without it. The film had a slow pace and the running time 162 minutes made it feel long which are two things that weighed it down the most. The movie is still worth seeing at least once because of the exceptional performances by Jackie Earle Haley and Bill Crudup. Despite some flaws Watchmen isn't really that bad of a movie it just could've been better. Watchmen has action, fist fights, blood, bone crushing hits, and good performances by the cast who make this graphic novel turned into a movie worth watching at least once as long as you can get past the overlong running time first."
"taifunu","8","2","4","18 June 2009"," great sound editing ;)
","I'm watching the movie and I think 'darn, this guy (Snyder) really has an eye for translating graphic novels onto the screen ! he just makes the drawn panels come to life... ... and then I think better about it and realize I'm somehow disappointed. What he did with 300 and Watchmen was to film the drawings, frame by frame... guess I wanted more than that. guess I wanted a re-telling of the story, not just a translation... But it works. it catches the essence of the comics. Maybe Moore should watch the movie. Don't know what he'd think of it, but he should at least watch it. <br/><br/>And the sound editing is just brilliant! <br/><br/>oh, and people, get over the use of the ""Hallelujah"" song, it was a joke ;) :))"

"GrantKanigan","Null","2","4","25 March 2009"," A long ride into the intelligent world of the Watchmen
","Zack Snyder is an exciting filmmaker to watch. Bursting onto the scene in 2004 with an updated version of the classic Dawn of the Dead, Snyder then went on to create one of the most astonishing comic book films ever created, and one of the best films of the past ten years, 300. With a financial backing and a realized artistic potential, we get Snyder's first all out effort on another beloved classic story, (in the comic book world), Alan Moore's Watchmen. Moore is also noted for creating the graphic novels V for Vendetta, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell.<br/><br/>Watchmen revolves around a group of masked vigilantes in an alternate 1985, (they are not superheroes, only one has actual powers from a research accident), and their investigation into the murder of one of their group of ""Watchmen"" All the while a symbolic doomsday clock moves to five minutes to midnight as the threat of nuclear war between USA and the USSR approaches. The murder of The Comedian, (Jackie Earle Haley), in a beautifully constructed scene of brutality, is the main plot point, and a colorful, well-developed cast investigate the murder and whatever else follows. <br/><br/>What follows besides the revealing of the murderer of the Comedian late in the film is very compelling. Watchmen asks, ""does the end justify the means?"" in a beautiful way. All 163 minutes of the film are well used to hammer home the finality of the last act of the film, and the homicide is ultimately not what the film is about. The characters are also well explored. We see the dark motivations of the sadistic and wholly unfunny Comedian, the grotesque past of Rorschach among others and the horrible throes of participating in vigilante justice. <br/><br/>As always, Snyder has a keen eye for the beauty in horror. Like 300, Snyder uses his unique aesthetic vision here, (the slow motion), only when necessary, like when we see the murder of the Comedian. The most astonishing scene in Watchmen may be the opening credits, which are 5 minutes long. Not only do they introduce the characters, but their history, motivation and personality. We see that the hero ""Dr. Manhattan,"" (Billy Crudup), is a hero who is great enough to shake hands with JFK, and the Comedian is a hero who is soulless enough to later assassinate him and get away with it. All in all, Snyder finds a near perfect balance between style and substance in this cinematic adventure.<br/><br/>Overall the only thing wrong with Watchmen is its complex narrative and its unconventional structure, which make the running time extended, although this will only bother some. It is a very intelligent film and demands your attention to every detail. This is no Dark Knight, although if the latest entry in the Batman series were the ""Godfather"" of comic book films, Watchmen would be the ""Goodfellas"" except with Stanley Kubrick directing instead of Scorsese. <br/><br/>In closing, Watchmen is a phenomenal film, and the acting of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach deserves an Oscar come next February. It isn't for everyone  it deserves an R rating; there is gratuitous gore, swearing, nudity, and other nonprintable acts, but they only exist to drive the story forward. The film is also too long for many at just under 3 hours, but all of the time is well spent. Lastly, don't expect to get Spiderman 4 or another Batman film. Watchmen is very unique, very intelligent and the ensemble cast of characters requires your attention. Watchmen is a film that enlightens first, (or more so just makes you think and question), and entertains later."
"FlorisV","9","2","4","25 March 2009"," Unbalanced but interesting
","This one's definitely worth more than one watch. Not only does it show superheroes far more flawed, in a darker way than Hellboy does, it also shows a meticulously constructed alternative history with Nixon and Kissinger still in the 80s government.<br/><br/>Overall the film is done very well graphically. The action scenes are spares but good while animations and backdrops are gorgeous. Costumes and atmosphere were great. A lot of classic 60s-80s songs used but it was done well. Definitely one to go see in High Definition with the best possible sound.<br/><br/>The Watchmen are each interesting characters. The casting of each of them was pretty good overall and my favorite is Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt, the enigmatic Ozymandias.<br/><br/>Rorschach was too much of a walking cliché, the type of hard nosed vigilante that seems to smoke too much cigarettes to be able to talk normally. While he looks short and thin, he is way too fast and strong to be believable in this film. Earley's performance without his mask is impressive nonetheless.<br/><br/>Like the Silk Spectre II, these characters do not really have superpowers yet they somehow beat the living hell out of any opponent with just their fists and feet. This is where the realism was lost too much at times. At times it would also get overly violent, particularly in the prison scenes related to Rorschach.<br/><br/>Ozymandias has no real superpower other than being exceptionally bright and fast in combat while also being outrageously rich and successful.<br/><br/>Dr Manhattan is the coolest of the Watchmen, actually being the only one to have superpowers like light speed travel, increasing/multiplying himself, manipulating matter at atomic level and what not. He also walks around naked most of the time which I thought was amusing, but does make sense from his perspective: why should he care? The combination of sadness and decreasing care for ordinary humans in his face is done well.<br/><br/>The Comedian is killed early but with all the flash forwards and flash backs he gets plenty of screen time. Good actor too. The most insane and evil of the bunch, he is actually the only one sane enough to use fire arms. It was weird to see so few relying on them.<br/><br/>The Director's Cut is great and pays a bit more attention to the sympathetic first Nite Owl.<br/><br/>Say what you want but I found this film much more interesting than the overrated Dark Knight, it shows more morally grey areas while there's no clear distinction between heroes and villains."

","After seeing the first preview for the Watchmen I immediately wanted to see the movie. The trailer looked fantastic and at the time I did not even know it was a book. I then proceeded to read the book and became even more eager for the movie.<br/><br/>I went into the movie with high expectations and was pretty disappointed. Don't get me wrong the movie wasn't terrible but it just never seemed to hit a climax. As far as the acting went Rorschach was fantastic and the Comedian was also pretty good but that was it. The visuals were great which is something I expected.<br/><br/>Malin Ackerman, sp? was absolutely terrible. The soundtrack was even worse, it seemed like the music never really matched up with the scenes. Honestly, I think that was one of my biggest gripes with the movie. Some of the music would actually make me laugh at what was going on, overall just some really strange music choices.<br/><br/>In my opinion the movie was mediocre, not great, but not terrible just kind of ehhhh. For what it is worth I think the movie was done as best as it could have been....but it should have been left to the pages and never brought to the big screen."

","This movie is based on a 12 issue graphic novel of the same name which was both created and written by Alan Moore. Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of comics (though bias towards Marvel), but I must admit I never read this series so I cannot comment on how great of a job or lack there of (depending on your view) was done by Zack Snyder (the director) and his crew on translating ""The Watchmen"" comic to the big screen but instead I will comment on my take of the movie mostly as that of a regular movie goer.<br/><br/>Heading into the theater I had my reservations and couldn't help but be a bit skeptical and unsure of what I was about to watch but I must admit that 1/4 of the way through the movie my fears had turn to enjoyment and fortunately in my opinion the movie ended up being fun, imaginative and worth watching. The movie was very well done across the board from its storyline, to it being artsy (but in a good way), as well as its characters, action, special fx and so on. I can't help but say that having watched ""The Watchmen"" was like watching a comic or artwork come to life; from the visually appealing colors to the scenes, and landscapes/backdrops which were used (last time I felt this way was with Sin City). I also must tip my hat off to ""The Watchmen"" for the casting job they did of hiring for the most part several small time names (with maybe the exceptions of Stephen McHattie as the original Nite Owl and Carla Gugino as the original Silk Spectre) Vs. the typical Huge Hollywood Name(s). Two of the actors which stood out to me during the movie in fact were Malin Akerman (Silk Spectre II) and Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach). Malin Akerman (Silk Spectre II) who's obviously extremely attractive holds her own as the lone female amongst her peers of predominantly male superheros while struggling to maintain her love life and gaining her mom's approval/acceptance. As for Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach); dag I didn't even recognize him since his days of playing ""Kelly Leak"" (the lone bad ass) on the original ""The Bad News Bears"". For starters; Yes I'm bias towards the ""Rorschach"" character from his appearance, to his hard edge somewhat methodical style. I was truly blown away to see it was Jackie Earle Haley who transformed and brought this character to life; he's certainly come a long way from his days on ""The Bad News Bears"" (I certainly mean that as a compliment).<br/><br/>(Possible Spoiler Alert) My only Nock or Con to ""The Watchmen"" was in it's ending though being translated from the graphic novel (as long as the script writers and Warner Brothers didn't take any liberties with changing the ending for movie purposes) then I can't put the blame on them (the movie) for it.<br/><br/>In conclusion I enjoyed, would recommend and would watch ""The Watchmen"" again. I hope this has been of some help and use. Enjoy."

","WATCHMEN (2009) ***1/2 Malin Akerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Carla Gugino, Matt Frewer, Stephen McHattie, Laura Mennell. Epic big-screen adaptation of Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons' cult-classic graphic novel involving a cadre of heroes in a parallel consideration of America in 1985 (Nixon is in his 5th term!) who are under attack when one of their allies is brutally murdered, sending the surviving avengers into dark and deeply thought whirlpools of existential dread (i.e.: Is it really worth saving the world if you can't save yourself?) Visually amazing and adept thanks to the 'visionary' filmmaker Zack Snyder the film is truly awe-inspiring in capturing the genre down-pact maybe just too much (if that's a caveat so be it) but not to take away from some truly draw-dropping set pieces (one word: Mars!) and stand-out turns by Crudup (as the tragically altered Jon Osterman aka ""Dr. Manhattan"") Morgan (as the amoral slain Comedian) and most definitely Haley (as the vigilante Rorschach), who blends classic Cagney and Ledger's ""Joker"" with a touch of Claude Raines' ""Invisible Man"" as a force to be reckoned with, making for a truly memorable anti-hero."

","Never read the graphic novels, but I'm a geek at heart and have enjoyed many of the recent comic book films, so I'm clearly the target audience. Nevertheless, I cannot recommend this film.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes or so are riveting. The film had me hook, line and sinker and I was ready for more. Sadly, that was it. For the next hour and 45 minutes or so...I was bored to tears. Not just because there were few action scenes, but because the story itself is a flat out bore. I have to admit, I was caught completely off guard by how incredibly boring the film was. I must have looked at my watch 5 or 6 times.<br/><br/>I have to imagine that the only people who will truly enjoy this film are those who loved the graphic novel and will be mesmerized watching this world come to life. For the rest of us...we require a more interesting storyline and far better pacing.<br/><br/>The finale is interesting, but not enough to salvage the film. Trust me folks...save this one for cable, it's not worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>I will say, it's stunning to watch, beautifully filmed and the sound effects/music were terrific. But special effects (much like wars) don't make movies (or men) great."
"public-39","7","2","4","15 March 2009"," Difficult homage achieved; whether it's an enjoyable film or not...
","...will depend on your viewpoint of the original material.<br/><br/>I'll leave the plot line synopsis to others and just focus on my thoughts and what I've gleaned from listening to others opinions.<br/><br/>Storyline: for the fan, 8 stars; for the general public, 5 stars. If you read ""Watchmen"" you'll appreciate the storyline and recognize almost every scene in the context of the book. I'm sure people who haven't read the source material will have a much harder time appreciating or even following the story. <br/><br/>Part of the ""wow"" factor of ""Watchmen"" the graphic novel was the incredible attention to detail that drew so many disparate elements together over the course of the book. Necessarily, much of that material had to be pared down for the movie. (Not all to the bad in my opinion--I always thought the ""Black Ship"" subplot detracted from the pacing of the main storyline, though I understand how it fit into the original work.) Audience members who were most disappointed seemed to have expected a standard superhero flick, and were not familiar with Moore's book.<br/><br/>Fidelity to the book: 9 stars The film does distill that main storyline extremely well: the vast majority of scenes and dialog are taken directly from the book, and the director did a fine job of trimming non-essential material, yet still found a way to include it as set pieces, cameos and homages to the novel. For fans of the book, all the essential elements are there, though many are given short shrift, especially Hollis Mason's tale. I found myself smiling as I recognized devices from the graphic novel given their few seconds of life on screen. <br/><br/>One critique: Though the novel is dark, bleak and violent, the movie is actually much more graphic in its depiction of that violence. Fight scenes are longer and the camera dwells on the blood, broken bones and severed limbs. This enhanced gore is the one aspect of the film that I feel is unnecessary and detracts from the whole.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I think the feel of Moore's ""Watchmen"" shines through this condensed film quite clearly. With the one caveat above, I don't think that could have been better accomplished.<br/><br/>Performances: 6.5 stars In general, the actors turned in good performances, though some of the characters did fall a bit short of Moore's characterizations. This isn't necessarily the actors' fault, as there isn't time to give six main characters equal treatment. I would say that Malin Akerman as Laurie and Matthew Goode as Veidt were credible, but nothing more. I thought Patrick Wilson did more with Nite Owl than what he was given, and rendered probably the most believable and true to character performance. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach also rose above Moore's somewhat purple dialog and his obscuring mask and delivered a compelling character on screen. Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan is appropriately distant and restrained, but that makes it hard to move beyond the dialog and expand the character. Jeffery Dean Morgan played The Comedian as sociopath very well.<br/><br/>Film making: 8 stars The cinematography and special effects brought the setting of the book to life, from the Gunga Diner to Jon's palace on Mars to Dreiburg's Owl Ship. Dr. Manhattan is probably the only jarring element to me. The CG animation was a bit off; the figure's movements weren't quite correct, and I never forgot I was looking at CG enhancement. Others have mentioned the full frontal male nudity as distracting and I have to agree, though I think that's mostly from it's rarity in American films (and perhaps some shared embarrassment from watching it in a crowded theater). I think it's more a comment on our immaturity than a criticism of the movie--what need has an Indestructible Man of clothing, and in the book it's shorthand for Dr. Manhattan's increasing detachment from humanity and it's concerns. In any case it isn't sexually provocative.<br/><br/>Wrap Up: 7.5 stars/4 stars Overall, I think the screenwriters and director have created an homage to Moore's work; given the incredible difficulty of bringing that story to film (let alone as a commercial studio release), I think it's remarkable how well they achieved that goal in a 2:45 movie and worthy of 9 stars. Yes, they took some liberties with the story and certainly some economy in the material, but what would you have them do? Deliver a 15-hour opus that would be unwatchable and unintelligible but for a handful of true believers? Not very realistic, and not a better alternative either, in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you liked Moore's ""Watchmen"" (and you're not an irrational fan-boy screaming about purity), go see the movie--you'll enjoy it on the big screen.<br/><br/>If you've never heard of the book, you should probably skip it--those in the audience so inclined at the screening I attended seemed bored or disgusted..<br/><br/>DEFINITELY, leave your kids at home. This film earns its ""R"" rating, not only for its dark and violent nature, but also for the morally ambiguous tone throughout; the resolution at the end is also something that children would not be expected to accept as appropriate."
"Cajuncrunch2","5","2","4","14 March 2009"," A Clock with a Lousy Craftsman
","Watchmen, as a book, was a fantastic character piece about the dark internal struggles of hypothetical costumed heroes. It was a deep, emotional, and often intellectual piece of art. The potential was always there for someone to take this most celebrated graphic novel of all time, and turn it into a great movie; A movie that would give physical portrayal to the personal struggles and the idealistic contradictions of the Watchmen. A film version of Watchmen would have touched some, and shaken others on a profound emotional level.<br/><br/>So, to whom do we hand this daunting cinematic task? Zack. Freaking Snyder. The freaking creator of 300. Seriously. Let's get the guy who directed The Iliad for dummies, and have him crap all over a dark, emotionally powerful script.<br/><br/>Snyder dumbs down the movie, turning it into an overzealous popcorn flick. He gears the movie towards the same morons that creamed their pants over the CGI effects in 300. The result, of course, is a totally paradoxical movie going experience: a clash between the psychological ambitions of the book, and combination of cheesy action scenes and misguided acting for which Zack Snyder can be blamed.<br/><br/>I have to admit, the first two scenes of the move were greatespecially with the songs that they were put to. The opening act, in which the Comedian is murdered, is made into a great piece of sonic irony by the lighthearted, soulful music that's played in the background (""Unforgettable"" by Nat King Cole). This is immediately followed by one of the best opening credit montages in recent memory, as the book's various appendices (read the book, you'll see) are touched upon to the sound of Bob Dylan's ""The Times They are A-Changin'"".<br/><br/>That's about where any praise for the filmmakers should end. Any brilliance in the rest of the movie is derived directly from the source material. Even Dr. Manhattan's great philosophical dialogs are not fully explored. The ""clock without a craftsman"" quote is there, albeit not in its entirety. Manhattan's ""nothing ever ends"" quote is said not by him to Veidt, but by Laurie to Dan (stupid, more on this later). On Mars, Manhattan tells Laurie that he has realized that her existence is a miracle because her mother hated her father, but that neglects the deeper motive behind his return to earth: in the book he explains that each human is a miracle because it took millions of random chances for each one to result in so specific a form.<br/><br/>The most glaring omission from the movie was the prison psychologist's internal realization of life's fragility. This was, in my opinion, the most important subplot of the book. By neglecting this, as well as Laurie and Dan's passionate exchange on the third-to-last page, the movie almost completely ignores one of the novel's central themes (the fragility of life). Yet another aspect of the movie that scoffed at its own potential.<br/><br/>OK, I'm ready. I'm ready to disclose my biggest beef with this film; the one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. Veidt and Manhattan. THEY CHANGED THE CHARACTERS! THEY CHANGED THE FREAKING CHARACTERS! How is anyone who read the book not OUTRAGED by this?!?! In the book, Manhattan is an all-knowing, god-like figure that has grown emotionless with time. He gradually loses connection with humanity, only to regain an appreciation for it while on Mars with Laurie. The movie made him too human.<br/><br/>On the contrary, the movie completely dehumanized Veidt, to the point that he wasn't even a realistic character. Zack Snyder made Veidt into the robotic super villain that his stupid popcorn flick needed. It, reminded me of every cheesy 80's movie in which the bad guy is some rich, preppy, blonde douche bag with a popped collar, a red Delorean, and no emotion whatsoever. Remember the bad guy from the Karate Kid? That's what Zack Snyder made Adrian Veidt into.<br/><br/>By living with the guilt of killing millions of innocent people, Veidt saved humanity with the ultimate sacrifice. Only the book truly acknowledges this. Veidt did it because he thought it was the right thing to do. Only the book truly acknowledges this. Afterward, Veidt is uncertain and insecure about the actual morality of his decision. Only the book even makes this possible, let alone acknowledges it.<br/><br/>The last scene at Veidt's Antarctic lair, in the book, is of Veidt asking Manhattan if, in the end, he did the right thing. Manhattan replies ""Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends."" Veidt then knows that right or wrong, he must live with the decision he's made. It's the culmination of an entire book's worth of moral, philosophical inquiries. The movie omits it. Zack Snyder knows that, right or wrong, he must live with the decision he's made. Screw you Zack Snyder."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","4","13 March 2009"," Dark - but no ""Dark Knight""
","I don't do graphic novels so I haven't read the 1986/87 ""Watchmen"" comics/book by British writer Alan Moore, but I'm a huge fan of superhero films so there was no way I was going to miss the movie adaptation, especially as it is directed by the young American Zack Snyder whose ""300"" I enjoyed so much. It is certainly well worth viewing since, in many respects, ""Watchmen"" is a true original - a film like no other you've seen before. It is a visual treat, irredeemably dark, outrageously violent, frequently bloody, sometimes sexy, and featuring an eclectic soundtrack.<br/><br/>These are superheros who depart big time from the standard. They may have two identities, which is almost compulsory, but - except for superb fighting skills - they actually lack super powers, with the notable exception of Dr Manhattan who is not so much a superhero as a kind of god, and these are deeply flawed 'heroes', vindictive and violent, who - at worst - rape and murder.<br/><br/>Set in a counter-factual 1985 version of America, it is hard to know which is scarier - the idea of Nixon winning a third term, avoiding Watergate and winning the Vietnam war or the threat of nuclear Armageddon from a US/USSR conflict and difficult to know which is more incredible - that exposing one man to radiation can turn him into a demi-god or that humankind can cope so easily with the nuclear obliteration of 15 million (the largest death toll in any movie in history?). In the end, it didn't quite work for me, mainly because the narrative is so disjointed and the finale insufficiently dramatic. The current benchmark of quality for superhero movies is ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Watchmen"" simply does not have the pacing, excitement and virtuoso acting of that movie."
"narfunkelthegreat","4","2","4","10 March 2009"," It might have been good...
","First, I have not read the comic, nor read anything made by Alan Moore. Watchmen is a film that, for the most part, prides itself on not being made for everybody. With being said, even those who might normally enjoy films like Watchmen should have had a hard time with the film. The film is a test for the average critic since it lasts over 150 minutes at a very slow pace. At the same time, half of the action is in slow motion.Rorshach is the only enjoyable exception amongst a bunch of poorly portrayed, unbelievable characters. <br/><br/>Actors and actresses aside,aren't the plot and the 'adult themes' supposed to be mind blowing for an audience which has been fed sub-par superhero films such as the unbearable Spiderman 3 and Superman Returns? If this is the case, then I must have confused Watchmen with some poorly written college freshman essay. I cannot believe the awful amount of writing in Watchmen. The screenplay is quite simply the worst I have seen in some time and the amount of nonsense is astronomical. <br/><br/>But there were some positives! Watchmen did bring up some interesting ideas about the ideas of justice in a world where a god literally lives amongst us. The visuals were, without doubt, impressive. I can't denounce Zach Snyder because he does movies, generally, pretty well. However, in the long run, I feel he fell for the same reason that kept so many directors in purgatory for so long: they say Watchmen was an unmakeable film, challenging directors since 1989. I agree; the movie should have been at least 2."
"jctundis","5","2","4","9 March 2009"," Adequate attempt at an unfilmable project. Dumbed down a bit.
","I've heard lots of people walked out, so it probably won't be in theaters long even with the blockbuster opening weekend. Friend at work thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen, just couldn't follow it. But this is a visual film best served in a theater.<br/><br/>Overall, I *would* have given it an 8 (the scene on Mars went beautifully) - except the retarded new ending dragged it down to maybe a 5. Worth seeing. Adequate to the task. Great visuals.<br/><br/>Of course many people will like the new ending. It's been dumbed down for the masses. As soon as I heard the ending was changed last year, I predicted it - so it elicited a big yawn from me at the theater (and I don't blame Alan Moore AT ALL for divorcing himself from this project - the re-write is an insult). I can't explain how self-defeating it is without giving too much away for those that haven't seen the movie (but have read the book).<br/><br/>I thought there was plenty of action (and sex), but another problem is that everyone seems to be a jacked up super-hero who can punch through or get slammed through concrete walls, etc - when the only one with actual super-powers is supposed to be Manhattan. Another basic level corruption of the source material.<br/><br/>They changed Rorschach *slightly* by lessening his hrrrrm vocal tick and streamlining him into kind of a Batman-ish bada@@. He still says it a few times under his breath, as if to substitute it for hmmm. Like ""hmmm. that's interesting"" or as a non-verbal response to something seen - not a recurring pattern in his speech that adds to the ""unpleasantness"" of being around Rorschach. But other than that, Jackie Earle Haley did a fantastic job! There are several scenes that seem to have animated themselves straight from the comic page as that is Snyder's strength as a director, not his writing. If the new ending is any indication of his ability as a storyteller, his skills are pedestrian at best.<br/><br/>Overall I did enjoy the film and I am one of those people that was there in September '86 reading Watchmen #1 off the rack. But I can't let that pathetic ending slide, and it brings the quality of the entire film down."
"petsteph1","6","2","4","9 March 2009"," Hmm, not so good.
","I saw this because of the reviews on this site. I had seen the trailer and dismissed it as another DC Comics/Comicon/X Men/Dark Knight/you name it wanna-be and I've seen enough for a while thanks. But the reviews were up there at 8.5 so I spent my bucks and went along expecting to be surprised. I was surprised by the amount of gore. The sex scene surprised me too. It also surprised my kids. Unfortunately those weren't pleasant surprises - and I am definitely not a prude but the sex and so much violence were so blatantly gratuitous that I really wondered what the other reviewers had seen in the movie. The plot was indecipherable for the first 15-20 minutes then finally one of the characters explained something and I got the general idea - ex-super (but not really super) heroes with character flaws...um... retired because of a law forbidding the wearing of masks. Richard Nixon was in there somewhere, too. And now in 1985 - the 'now' - of the movie...with Nixon still President... um right - someone was killing the ex-superheroes. But then the next character explained something else and I lost it again. Meanwhile one of the ex-superheroes isn't ex because he's building some energy thing to save the world while Russia and the US are about to destroy each other... he glows blue and talks like an announcer in a shopping mall and he wants to live on Mars.... It makes me weary just trying to sort that much to write it down and that's just the back-story, sort of... Wow. Well, anyway, I thought it was all just way over the top, way over-produced, some occasional good acting but way too gory, way too jarring for no good reason at all, way, way WAY too corny in the last 20 minutes. And just really a waste of good popcorn. One reviewer compared this movie to Brazil and that prompted me to see it. He must have meant the country because he couldn't possibly have meant the movie."

","I went into this movie hearing a lot of hype, so maybe that is why I rated it a 5/10, but I was not very impressed. Firstly, you should know that this movie should not be compared to other super hero movies because it is much different, but also, it is not as good as the Dark Knight, Spiderman, etc...<br/><br/>It is a different blend of movie, a combination not tried often, and though some may argue that it was pulled off successfully, there were still many flaws in the movie.<br/><br/>Because it was adapted from a graphic novel, too much plot is crammed into a slightly less than 3 hour movie. However, even if the movie was split in two distinct movies, there still are so many emotions to the point that Watchmen feels over dramatized. <br/><br/>If you like violence, go see it, if you aren't a huge action fan, wait until it comes out on DVD"
"Haynerator","6","2","4","8 March 2009"," 'Hello Mr. Snyder, is that another over-hyped mainstream display of laziness in your pocket?'
","The word visionary, is a poor label to slap on Snyder. I would give him credit for it in '300' being that I've not read the book for it, but in the instance of 'Watchmen', I have read and greatly enjoyed the graphic novel. Whilst reading it I was unsurprised that a movie was being made, and was also unsurprised that Snyder would be directing. But from the point I heard his name, my expectations started to drop. Having seen, and been greatly dissatisfied by, '300' and 'Dawn of the Dead' (His biggest previous hits) I couldn't say I was expecting too much directionally from 'Watchmen'.<br/><br/>Often when low expectations are in order, they are exceeded particularly easily. However they were matched, and actually having read the graphic novel, I saw exactly what kind of director Snyder is. He is a lazy one. Pretty much for all of his shots, he used the graphic novel as a storyboard. He used practically no creativity in creating his shots; he just took them straight out of the book and slapped them onto the big screen. This does not make Snyder a visionary; this makes him a very lazy boy, as well as a cop-out. I can only assume this was his vague attempt at appealing to fans of the novel, when fans have already been drawn in by the name of the film.<br/><br/>The film also lacked a lot of the depth that the book had. The film had an onslaught of flashback sequences establishing characters psyche, and the way they are in the present time frame. While somewhat necessary to the depth of character, there are many more inventive ways of establishing the same sense of character, and this is once again laziness, but on the hands of screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse. However, while these flashbacks gave great depth of character to the cast members who could act well, it detracted very heavily from the main story, which is where the depth is lacking the most.<br/><br/>In the novel, the story is a very well executed consistently running undertone. In the film it is a poor one. We start with an introduction to the main plot, and then it seems to be practically dropped for all the flashbacks and character establishment. By the end the main plot is wrapped up far too quickly, with minimal and static development which could easily leave new audiences a little bemused and clueless as to what happened, as well as how and why.<br/><br/>The shining performance here is without a doubt, Jackie Earle Haley. Haley plays 'Rorschach', the darkest and deepest character, and his performance throughout is absolutely perfect. Not only does he portray the character well from the book, but he simply performs brilliantly as an actor. Billy Crudup also gave a fantastic performance as 'Dr. Manhattan', his facial expressions and attenuate display of emotion is executed superbly. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for most of the other cast, in particular Malin Akerman, who plays 'Silk Spectre II'. Whilst she is without a doubt the most stereotypical character in the novel, this is no reason why she cannot perform well. She is greatly unimpressive. Patrick Wilson lacked something too. He's not a terrible actor from what I've seen before, but it feels as if he is lacking something as 'Nite Owl II'. It is possible that this is down to Snyder's direction, but could equally be Wilson's fault.<br/><br/>Whilst overall depth is lost, with only two exceptional performances, and replicated camera work; it can't be faulted that the special effects are stunning. The effects are quite thrilling, but the thrill isn't really felt too much, it's eye candy with no heart. The fight scenes with gratuitous violence, 'Rorschach's unorthodox methods of acquiring information, and almost anything involving 'Dr. Manhattan' (in particular, obliterating Vietcong with a single thought), made for a visually pleasing set of scenes, even if the cinematography is just an uninventive replication.<br/><br/>Though, these scenes are simply not enough. Due to the lack of story depth, it leaves most in-between scenes feeling underdeveloped and a little tedious; perhaps not so much for fans of the novel, but especially for new audiences. It feels like they tried to simply replicate the graphic novel as is, whilst taking odd bits out here and there. For new audiences this will create a feeling of emptiness, due to the fact that there are subtle nuances within the book that might not seem valuable, but add to the character as well as story, and are thus actually important.<br/><br/>As a companion to the book, this is pretty entertaining and works well, being that fans will know what is going on and are able to fill in any blanks. But for new audiences, especially those who've never heard of 'Watchmen' before, this will just seem tedious, undeveloped and perhaps just a little bit messy with some visual high-points around. Added to this, the soundtrack was particularly 'try-hard', including Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' during a notably cheesy love scene. As well as some dreadful rock song over the end credits. This seemed distinctly detached from the rest of the film, especially given the time period.<br/><br/>Overall, this works best as a companion to the book and is mostly fan orientated. But for new audiences I don't really recommend it, for there will be disappointment and emptiness. Personally, I must admit that I was reasonably entertained by the film, but I feel this is because I am a fan of the novel, and therefore know the ins and outs of the story. But it doesn't really do the book much justice to be perfectly honest. I'll be keeping an eye out for Jackie Earle Haley, but I won't be rushing out to see this film again. This is a fairly unimpressive 6 out of 10; an uncreative, lazy, near beat-for-beat replication."

","I entered the theatre with only a very brief notion of what The Whatchmen was supposed to be, 'a group of super heroes that are as confused by the human condition as everyday people are.' But really, even having that bit of information fed to me before hand, I went into the movie with no preconceived notions. (if you can believe that anyone is capable of such a feat) : P <br/><br/>The opening montage laid a great foundation for the rest of the film and explained the setting, era, style and plot basics effectively enough for me to be ready to appreciate 'The Watchmen' and their situation. The first character I was introduced to was 'The Comedian' who became one of my favorites. Even though he received very little of the screen time, the spirit of what he represented was delivered potently and used well throughout the movie. I consider this to be one of the film's strong points.<br/><br/>After the starting storyline was established, the next notable motivation of the movie was a series of developed introductions to key players in The Watchmen organization. This portion of the movie was also very satisfying, continuing to give me interesting and important background information and also presenting the characters in a variety of clever and moving ways. At this point (about an hour into the movie) I was pretty stoked for the rest of story.<br/><br/>It is here that my personal disappointment began. The plot took a turn toward the 'hot super-chick' (who's most efficacious quality turns out to be that she's hot). I know you're reading this and noticing some angst, fair enough, but if you can indulge me for a bit hopefully you will see that my criticisms are beyond mere contempt for pretty people in Hollywood. This movie struck me as an attempt at disenfranchising the super hero in a more serious fashion than a movie like Hancock. However, for me, everything that it built up in originality was deflated by presenting me with a played-out plot dynamic that I can find in any super hero movie: That is, a gravitating twist of the story based on the turmoil that a hero experiences because of his involvement with some girl. Honestly, of all the things that a character like 'Mr. Manhattan' could come to struggle with, it turns out to be a female who's not really developed within the movie as being interesting in the first place. If they wanted to make 'The Silk Spectre II' a character of such significance based on her relationship with Mr. Manhattan, then they needed to show me more than a couple of sex scenes to give her weight to throw around in the story.<br/><br/>While I'm on the topic of Mr. Manhattan, I'll mention that he was a fascinating character for me, who sadly was unable to fulfill what I had built him up to be in my mind. The best I can explain this supposed shortcoming is in this way: In the middle of the movie his magnitude was created from giving the viewer a sense of awe and limitless possibility in Mr. Manhattan. His conflict with The Silk Spectre II didn't really diminish this effect, however he was eventually duped too easily by the movie's semi-villain, and then sold short with a couple cheesy one-liners towards the end of the movie to provide some resolve. I think the writers would have done better to preserve the mysteriousness of Mr. Manhattan, but of course you could always propose the defense that these were intended to be extraordinary beings with all too human problems.<br/><br/>Those are my two biggest gripes with the film, and unfortunately they were too important to the overall project to be overlooked completely. On the good side, the film featured a really cohesive theme all throughout. The successful occupation of Vietnam due to super-human intervention was a cool historically revisionist approach. I like that they kept the revolutionary (hippie) movement and then used it as a prevailing theme to color the story and soundtrack. I also enjoyed the generic, non-commercialized showcasing of the characters. It fit nicely with the 'dethroning' of idealized super heroes.<br/><br/>A side note / conspiracy theory: I don't have much evidence to support this, but I get the feeling that major players in American culture/business are subsidizing film makers to incorporate subtle advertisements into their movies. I noticed it first with 'Constantine' which seemed to be a not-so-subtle anti-smoking ad. I'll cut to the point, for some reason 'Night Owl II' had a problem with erectile dysfunction which was completely superfluous to the story. They introduced us to it in the middle of the movie and then in the end had a mini ED prescription ad when Silk Spectre II asked him ""Is everything alright down there?"" To which he vaguely replied (I can't remember exactly what he said) ""I checked it out and got it fixed!"" Does anyone else detect these weird things in our movies these days or is it just me?"
"a-roque","6","2","4","6 March 2009"," Watchmen gave me blue balls
","The Watchmen gave me blue balls just like Dr. Manhattan's. That is to say I appreciated the effort but I left a little sore. Zack Snyder's film isn't without its merits, there are some good performances and some really stunning visuals despite the some of the CG being about as realistic as a Command & Conquer cinematic. It has many flaws. While this is a very faithful adaptation, perhaps to a fault (I'd be curious to see how Darren Aronofsky's contemporary version would have played out) they sure did throw out the ending. This film's ending diverges from the source material in a very disappointing way. Doing it the way it is written would have probably cost more money, and I think that may have been a concern because I don't think anyone hired a music director. Instead I think Snyder opted to hook his iPod up to the Avid and press shuffle. The music is spastic, and really in cohesive. One piece of music seemed to fit a rainy neon filled night pretty well and it sounded like Vangelis. Where have a heard that before? Oh yeah Blade Runner. This movie is It's borderline satirical when it could have taken itself more seriously. The action is very heavy handed. The fights are way over the top with a lot of wire work. ZACK SNYDER IS AN OVERCRANKING RAMP FIEND , I get it! Things look cool in slow motion; check out the show Time Warp on the discovery channel. All in all this film is entertaining because it is derived from a really brilliant piece of fiction and in a distilled less intelligent way the film successfully brings it to life. It's worth watching the Watchmen, but it is not the film it could have been."
"Cel_Stacker","7","2","4","6 March 2009"," ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?""
","It is...a most interesting version of 1985. Nixon has been president for FAR too long, the Soviet Union struggles with the West over control of Afghanistan, and crime and social upheaval are at an all time high.<br/><br/>And, oh yeah, superheroes exist.<br/><br/>However, superheroes have problems, just like anyone else. The most notable of super teams, the Minute Men, had long passed their glory days and handed the torch to the next generation, whose problems were so severe that they wound up disbanded.<br/><br/>But now, the murder of a veteran member causes these new Watchmen to unite again, with the purpose of solving said murder, and perhaps, saving the world once again.<br/><br/>As different as the source material upon which this movie was based proved to be, I never really liked it. I knew very little of the mysterious writer Alan Moore at the time that I read it (somewhere between high school and college), but he would go on to write works that I enjoyed much more. I gained an appreciation for the dark themes and the social mirrors he explores. But after two readings, I found this particular story somewhat abrupt and naive.<br/><br/>Now, a movie comes along. Surprise, surprise, it proves effective.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting the typical comic book nonsense (aside from Christopher Nolan's take on Batman, and a scant few other examples, that is) to which we've been exposed up to this point. In fact, it's most effective if you attend with no expectations at all. This prompts me to wave a BIG flag before parents--it's rated R for a reason. In fact, there are many reasons.<br/><br/>Some solid performances abound in a cast of actual character actors rather than stars. In particular, talking head followers should enjoy the fine actors portraying The MacLaughlin Group and Ted Koppel. The musical choices pull you in to the narrative, reflecting the troubled era well. (Who would have thought that a Bob Dylan tune would be such a powerful intro?) The film is faithful to the source material to no grammatical fault.<br/><br/>This is one problem critics have had with the film already. One such critic, whose review I thought was rather good otherwise, put forth that the photo-play is so faithful to the novel, that it lacks any spirit of its own. I don't necessarily argue with that, but I do differ with the idea that the story is irrelevant due to the passage of time. (Since there's no Soviet Union, etc.) It's the reason for my title. Some will recognize the classic Chicago Transit Authority tune: ""Does anybody really care? And so I can't imagine why, we've all got time enough to die..."" (Kinda surprised they didn't add that one.) If anything, the social and cultural connotations of a story like this are MORE relevant today than ever.<br/><br/>In a world facing problems like economic downturn, increasing social upheaval, and families being ruined by a whole lot more than just war, perhaps it is the right time to revisit The Watchmen."

","You may not like the movie. I hadn't even heard of Watchmen until one Simpsons episode and even then wasn't sure what the big deal was when they were filming right outside my house. I went expecting loads of action, great story lines and just all around mouth dropping greatness. I was honestly sorely mistaken. I feel as though the previews took every good scene of the movie and the rest were just filler. There are some really good scenes that weren't from the trailer, particularly those of Rorschach but other parts just seemed so useless.<br/><br/>The action was great when it was there, and the graphics were amazing, but that seems like all it was. I felt they were trying to hard with the slow-motion shots and the dramatic effects. It was almost like they were using it solely because it was what made 300 so popular. But it was overdone, I believe. The acting I felt was great, but I could have done without the sex scenes (one in particular) It just felt silly to watch really. Maybe its more of a GN fan kind of thing, because some people really enjoyed it *rolls eyes* The soundtrack was interesting, it was appropriate when you stopped to think about it, but when you first heard each song it sort of made you pause and ask, ""really?"" Overall I suppose its a decent movie (though 3 hours may have been too long), but it wasn't worth getting home at 3:30 this morning."

Snyder's choice to not include the squid may be bothersome to many but I feel it was a good choice considering die hard fans of the novel aren't the only ones who will watch this and it should be easier to digest.

"Alex_Traveller","8","0","0","9 December 2018"," Watchmen - solid superhero movie with a compelling narrative
","The film shows us a glimpse of a world where superheroes identities are known to men as a group of retired heroes take part in everyday life. The story takes off as Rorschach, a costumed vigilante, learns that one of his comrades was murdered and in his investigation uncovers a huge plot to kill and discredit all superheroes. Rorschach gets in touch with his former retired associates and together they fight to save themselves and the world, which is endangered as well. As you see the narrative of this film is quite special, though it contains the essence of every superhero movie - saving the world. However, the take on the costumed heroes in Watchmen is entirely different compared to other similar films, as they are presented broken, retired, old & used.<br/><br/>Regarding the casting, I believe some of the choices were phenomenal. For instance, the performance of the narrator of the film Rorschach, portrayed by an incredibly talented Jackie Earle Haley, was so dark, realistic and convincing that it was a real pleasure to watch him act. Jackie's version of Rorschach goes in line with the noir tone of the graphic novel and shows a vigilante who without hesitation is prepared to sacrifice himself to save everyone else. Another breathtaking performance was delivered by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (portraying the Comedian), an actor so versatile and brilliant. Prior to Watchmen Jeffrey experienced a world in need of saving in a successful CW's TV show ""Supernatural"", and already there showed his devotion to the material. In Watchmen, Jeffrey portrays a reckless and violent hero showing us his dark side, which he does masterly. I even believe that Jeffrey's experience in Watchmen inspired him and helped him years later to deliver such an astonishing performance in ""The Walking Dead"" as a ruthless leader Negan. As for others, Patrick Wilson as a hero Nite Owl, Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II were quite good in their roles. Both brought the essence of their characters very close to the source material, though missed out on bringing such depth and devotion as in the case of Jeffrey and Jackie.<br/><br/>Overall Watchmen with its incredible visual effects, great performances, and a compelling storyline is, in my opinion, one of the hidden jewels of the films based on DC comics."

"alexisbessonmackain","10","0","0","10 August 2018"," An excessive masterpiece
","First off'I would like to say that i have never read the graphic novel so i am going to be reviewing the film on its own terms starting with the director. Zack Snyder is known by many as a controversial filmmaker. I have a mixed opinion of him as well. I am not a huge fan of 300 though i did like man of steel and batman v superman the ultimate edition (both were good but extremely flawed films). However. this film was different, courageous and evoking the style of Quentin Tarantino and Stanley Kubrick. First off, the visuals are absolutely stunning as in most of his films. The performances are mostly excellent with the highlights being Jeffrey Dean Morgan's charismatic and mean turn as the Comedian and Haley""s gritty performance as Rorschach. However what elevates this film above other superhero films are both the complex thought-provoking plot and the graphic content which works for and against the film. The graphic content in the film (particularly the sex scenes) are quite excessive with one being played to the song ""Hallelujah"" which can deter anyone uncomfortable with the content. The complex plot might also dissuade less patient fimgoers and superhero fans from watching the film, particularly those who have not read the novel. The themes of the film are smart and clever as the film questions society, humanity and morality through its alternate reality of the Cold War and its characters who are flawed and sometimes unlikable unlike other humerous heroes like Spider Man. <br/><br/>Overall, I am sorry if my review does not include many details but i am going to summarise this review by saying that Watchmen is Zack Snyder's masterpiece, one of my favourite superhero films, highly underated by critics and i suggest giving this film a go if you like superhero films or dark and complex tales which talk about morality."

It is too prolix and discursive, without any focus on anything. Many things happen, but it does not make much sense and it looks like it does not lead anywhere. There are movies that start slow and even boring, but later everything starts to make sense, but here, even after more than two hours, there's no real plot to hold your attention. Okay, the movie lasts for three and a half hours, so at that moment there's still the duration of the entire average movie left, but two hours of introduction is really too much. After more than two hours story begins to get meaning and movie brings some really impressive scenes. Sex in the aircraft was first thing to wake me up a little and then follow the action scenes in prison and scenes on Mars. If the whole movie was like that half an hour or so, I would probably be thrilled, but two hours of boring introduction to the story at the pace of tectonic movements and over the top ending, with totally redundant pathetic elements, prevailed in the formation of the overall impression. Less than hour of excellent material with everything before it being boring and everything after it being stale. The best thing about this movie is great music (Nat King Cole, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Janis Joplin, Billie Holiday, Leonard Cohen, Jimi Hendrix), and Carla Gugino, who, even in a supporting role, always improves the overall impression and makes me rate a movie at least half a star higher.

Dr. Manhattan's effects and Billy Crudup's port rail is spot on to what Id think Manhattan shouldn sound like. Where the movie falls is in it's Female lead. She was one of the most developed in the comic but she comes of as cold and whiny. Malin Ackerman has the most shoddy line delivery in the movie, right next to Matthew Goode, that may be because he had to do an American accent with his very British one.

The villain and ending could have been more interesting and dynamic, but after more viewings it gets better and better. There is really a lot to think about in the themes the film touches on. What is the true nature of humanity? Are humans really violent at the core? Are we really a flawed intelligence? Absolutely fascinating. Could do without Dr Manhattan's wang in the film, doesn't really add anything and is a point of ridicule. Great story, great music, great characters, fantastic effects, expansive in scope, this movie is the comic book fully realized on screen. What sets it apart from other run of the mill comic book adaptations is the amazing deep story. Complete with alternative historical events it is a world rich with atmosphere and detail. Gritty and dark the world of Watchmen is a confronting critique of humanity and not all of it good. What is human nature and can it be changed, do we really want to know the answer...?

","I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and understanding nothing of what was going on. It wasn't a usual superhero flick with a clear villain. And besides it was weird and graphic, so naturally I didn't like it that much. Now on my first proper viewing of the film I decided it would be best to check out the Ultimate Edition. I can honestly say that I like a lot more compared to what I did eight years ago. It's a conspiracy story that takes place in an alternate version of the 20th century. The visual narrative is gripping and it's what I enjoyed the most. Just the image of Rorschach on a rooftop while it's raining gives me such a great noir feeling. It was kind of refreshing to see superheroes in a complex thriller like this. You get to know the characters decently well even though I'm not the biggest fan of some of them. Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre are OK, but Manhattan's behavior and monotone voice started to bug me. I found myself siding with Nite Owl and Rorschach the most. Their relationship felt the most pure hearted to me. I still think some of the graphicness could have been toned down. But I guess that's because they followed the novel so closely.<br/><br/>The Ultimate Edition is over three hours long. Yep.. Well, I saw the whole thing. It's overstuffed, but the additional runtime gave each character-arch more air to breath. There are definitely some interesting moral questions brought up which I did get intrigued by. The extra animated segment was a good mood-piece, but it's something best left for the curious fans. It's basically a story within a story and it goes in a dark and psychological direction. When it comes to the actual live-action movie I feel that some exposition eventually started to drag. And most of the gratuitous stuff and slow-motion still came out as a sore thumb to me. I'm sorry, but it got distracting. Nevertheless we get excellent cinematography, good action and great visual design. This could possibly be Zack Snyder's best comic book film.

","I have no idea how the comic book original was, but I find it hard to believe that lesbian sex and karate were featured there at that time in the puritanical America. Yet the visuals are quite special, almost nearing the productions coming out of Asia, like the new generation of Chinese (In the Mood for Love) and Korean movies. Also the story is quite dynamic although the violence still feels gratuitous compared with the Korean violent action movies.<br/><br/>Sadly the story background is in sync with the mind of a poorly educated comic book script writer. He does not get much. And he says too much, exactly like the Sci Fi writers of the same generation. Somehow it used to be cool to be an ignorant and use science as a bag for buzz words. Hopefully this trend is off when anybody can check Wikipedia on their smartphone.<br/><br/>Still, the action is good enough to compensate for the shortcomings.<br/><br/>Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"

","Watchmen is a superhero film different from the others, it stands out from Marvels movies but its dark side shows that it is a DC. We are in a period of Cold War and heroes must save the world from a nuclear threat. The script is good, plans are very detailed and meticulous and special effects, especially those of Dr. Manhattan are successful. Here we see unconventional heroes, with no powers, except for Dr. Manhattan, they are only men, they are not invincible and certainly are not angels, the Comedian is the perfect example. However, the film is too long, 2H45 is too much! The character of Rorschach is very interesting, however, I am very disappointed to have seen his face, is what tipped me more for the 7 than for the 8. Note Also that the film has a good Original Sound Track. An unconventional superhero movie."
"scorpio-17","6","0","0","13 July 2009"," Worth watching but ultimately disappointing
","Having been a long-time fan I watched this with an obvious bias and while I enjoyed it, there were far too many moments where my enjoyment was marred by the diversions from the original. While there's been an effort to retain many of the subtexts, this is primarily an action film and has lost a lot of the angry satire of the comic.<br/><br/>If you've never read the comic book then you will enjoy this film a lot more than I did and it will set you up well to go back and read the source but for those of us who have had years to read, re-read and think about the original, this film is full of compromises which, although understandable, leave the end result a bit too empty and sadly unrewarding.<br/><br/>This is no reflection on those involved and the effort has to be admired, especially in the way many of the actors were able pull off the transfer of so many of the characters from paper to screen but again, compromises; Rorschach, Nite Owl II, The Comedian and Dr Manhattan were close to perfection, but Ozymandias was sadly underwhelming (no fault of the actor who did well with what he had - the character had been compromised to fit the film).<br/><br/>The music choices were generally pretty good for a soundtrack which used a lot of existing compositions to fit the mood, although it was disappointing that the use of Koyaanisqatsi, while clever, fizzled out at the end.<br/><br/>I would like to be able to watch this again in a few years and enjoy it for its strengths rather than weaknesses but for now all that lingers are the thoughts of what could have been.<br/><br/>So, overall a good effort but in all honesty the only way to do the original justice would be to turn it into a mini-series rather than a single film - Although many people complained about the length, I personally felt it was too short and painfully so. One good thing coming out of this is that someone has shown it can be done and at least provides a starting point for others to build on.<br/><br/>*edit*<br/><br/>Having had a few more weeks to think about it, nearly everything that has come to mind about the film has been pretty much negative: The violence is so over-the-top that it becomes ridiculous, especially considering that these crime fighters have effectively been in retirement for a number of years.<br/><br/>Parts of the film which probably sounded really cool at the filming stage are laughable, i.e. Dr. Manhattan striding across the fields of Vietnam to the strains of Wagner. The fight between Veidt and the others at the end is just downright silly when you see the way he throws them around, is he supposed to have some kind of power-suit?<br/><br/>The original comics have a grittiness which, although portrayed in a fantastical world, have a grounding in some kind of physical reality - Unfortunately, the film takes too many liberties, and where the special effects should be reined in, they run riot and the substance of the film suffers in restropsect.<br/><br/>I'm sure now that I will not watch this film for a 2nd time and would much rather read the original any day."

Maybe for a 3 minute ad-break...and it probably still make as much sense and have less flaws. For the acting? No, no-one besides Rorschash should have a job outside of an afternoon soap. For the character development? what character development? For the naked blue man? Can anyone explain why he actually wore pants to fight/win the Vietnam War but at no other time? Maybe the army insisted on it. For the sex scene? The puppet sex scene in Team America:World Police is more believable. And the version of Hallelujah playing made it even more laughable. At this point I actually wondered if it was made intentionally funny by the director. Well, he might have realised how badly the shoot was going... The fight scenes probably filled only about 15 minutes of the excruciating 2hrs 45. There is a lot of gratuitous violence but the film was so dull, even this lost its impact. Awful film."

"dbborroughs","6","4","12","7 March 2009"," Good not great film is too faithful to be truly wonderful on its own terms
","n an alternate 1985, when Richard Nixon is working on his fifth term, someone throws former superhero The Comedian out of his high rise window. One of his former allies, a masked crusader name Rorschach smells a rat and he begins to contact his old cronies because he fears that some one is going after former superheroes. What Rorschach doesn't know is that what is going on is way beyond simple murder.<br/><br/>Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's classic comic story has finally come to the screen. This is a story, which along with Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns changed not only comics but culture (all culture) forever. I remember reading the graphic novel version of the comic when it came out and being so floored that I went around giving people copies of the novel. <br/><br/>The film is that its good but not great. It is too faithful and too artificial to truly be great. There are the seeds of a great film here and when they eventually remake it there will be a great film version.<br/><br/>Zach Snyder is a transcriber here. He is far from the visionary director that the ads and some reviews have described. What he's done is essentially take Dave Gibbon's panels and put them on the screen. There is very little original to what he's put on the screen. Much of the dialog seems to be Moore's as well. On some level its almost as if he ripped the pages from the novel and put them on the screen. Yes Snyder and his collaborators have made cuts and changes, but for the most part what you see is the novel. <br/><br/>The problem is that Snyder in being faithful to the comic has forgotten that with a comic the mind will connect the panels and that the mind will add life to material between ""the lines"". Snyder in being faithful to the material never added the life to his tableaux.There is no life past the edges of the screen. I never really became engaged until about half way in when the power of Patrick Wilson's acting lifted the film despite the other short comings. Wilson brought a life to the proceedings that transcended the rest of the film.(This isn't to sell the rest of the cast short. Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Matt Frewer, and Stephen McHattie are Wilson's equals) Snyder's faithfulness to the book has also caused another problem, it shows the limitations of the source novel. This is not to sell the novel short only to point out what works on the page doesn't work on the screen.<br/><br/>(I want to raise questions about plot points not being all that great but I'm not sure if the problem is Moore's or Snyder's so I'm going to reserve picking the plot apart until I see the directors cut and reread the novel- though I will say that some of the Mars material is silly)<br/><br/>Snyder is also too faithful in his shot choices. We don't need all of the shots that are exactly the same as the comic. Set up the situation, and let it play out in real space with out the need to match the comic panels. And while I'm bitching about being too close, we don't need the whole sex scene between Night Owl and Silk Spectre, nor do we need to see ever broken bone, every whack in the head with a meat clever. Less is more. We know the pair is having sex, we don't need a Leonard Cohen video. And didn't Snyder ever realize that when you want to have violence continue to have an effect you show the results once and then you have the audiences attention, since after the third time it becomes silly. <br/><br/>I know it seems like I'm taking the film apart, and I am. I can't help not doing it because this film should have been better, this should have been so much better. I mean the moment when Patrick Wilson suits up for the first time in a long time was magical. but little else is. I blame director Snyder who either just is copying some one else's material or is falling back on tricks- say Slow Motion. to cover his limitations. I think if Snyder had used this script and this cast and had dared to be different in something other than the ending I think he would have made a great film. Lets face it the reason the novel is so popular is that its a great story and when thats allowed to shine, mostly in the second half the film is really good.<br/><br/>I shouldn't be able to pull as much of this film apart as I am. I should have been more engaged and not thinking about what didn't work.<br/><br/>Its a good film but its not a great one.<br/><br/>And I know you probably want to know what about the ending. How is the end of the film as compared to the novel. I think its okay, it works. I don't know that its works as well as the original but it works. <br/><br/>(I should point out that I don't think the film as a bleak and dark as many people have said. I don't see the heroes in the film as any darker than any other hero in comics. They are heroes and anti heroes, and the only difference is that the damage they cause is ""real"". What did people think would have happened when Batman kicked the snot out of someone? The joke always was that Batman could beat someone into a coma but wouldn't cross the line to killing some one...here...things are less clear.)"

","I knew what the early reviews were saying so I thought that at the very least, my expectations would be low enough to be pleasantly surprised by any spark of interest.<br/><br/>The only thing I was interested in was whether it was possible to put a sleeper hold on myself. This movie was excruciatingly long and somehow the action sequences, which tend to speed up any movie, were almost as boring as each individual character's 45 minute back story.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why this failed is the same reason why a lot of horror movies fail; they forget to follow the golden rule. The golden rule is to wait until the last possible moment to show ""the monster"". The monster can quite literally be the monster in the horror genre or, in action, it's the big climactic scene where the escape/explosion/rescues etc. take place. This movie did not follow that rule. They prematurely showed the monster. Now before the geek boys come at me with ""It's the Watchmen... they follow no rules... ooooooh.... it's a graphic novel...""<br/><br/>Just stop it.<br/><br/>With skulls getting cut in half, arms sawed off, pregnant women shot, ""almost"" rapes, bodies exploding... enough already; we get it. The so-called ""line"" was crossed so many times that you were completely desensitized fifteen minutes into it and nothing held any weight anymore. I was literally wondering if they were just running out of things to do. There was no momentum and no build towards the climax and what little investment you had to begin with was more than spent by the time these characters had their big final suit-up moment.<br/><br/>The music choices were jarringly weak: How many times can ""The Sound of Silence"" be used in films these days and still be taken seriously? The use of ""All Along the Watchtower"" was so heavy-handed that it was just lame... Oh, I get it! ""All Along the WATCHtower"" and we're watching ""The WATCHmen"" so clever. Attempts at humor in the music selection were pretty feeble and quite dated. During a scene where big businessmen are arguing over energy resources, elevator music covering Tears for Fears' ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" plays in the background... Ha... Ha....haaaaa.<br/><br/>The only commendable part of the movie was Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach. Haley is probably most recognizable in his fantastic and subsequently Oscar- nominated performance as a sex-offender in Little Children where he played opposite Patrick Wilson and Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that the girls in this flick get no credit in the writing department. Shocker. They are hollow creatures with uncomplicated minds that allow them to bounce easily between a radiating, blue nudist and a geek. I know in action movies girls are there to be rescued or to look good in leather and latex but at least Trinity in The Matrix did it with dignity and a brain.<br/><br/>This movie was awful and the only people who stand by it are the fans who have waited dutifully for its release... much like those who stand by the embarrassment that is Rent: the Movie. The best part of my experience was watching the newly revamped previews for Star Trek, Terminator Salvation, Angels and Demons and Wolverine.<br/><br/>It's too late for me but please, save yourselves."

","'Watchmen', one of what sometimes seems like an interminable number of comic-book adaptations, is fundamentally a very strange film. On one hand, it's a straightforward superhero movie; on another, it's a neo-noir tale of an alternate world where that dangerous peacenik Richard Nixon has enjoyed decades of unbroken power and the world has been ruined by liberal conspiracy. On yet a third hand, it's an over-the-top (and half-baked) piece of science fiction fantasy of wild incoherence. Half of the superheroes in this film are just ordinary policemen and women wearing capes; one of the others transcends all laws of physics. Ultimately, this is a movie about style over substance, but its insane length makes no sense given it has so little integral meaning.

"gavin6942","9","3","8","6 August 2009"," A Movie Adaptation Worthy of the Comic
","In an alternate world set in 1985, Nixon is still president and the two superpowers are on the brink of nuclear war. The only deterrent, Dr. Manhattan, has turned his back on humanity and fled the planet... pushing the doomsday clock even closer to midnight. Can Manhattan be persuaded to return to Earth, or is this the end of the human race? Watchmen is a brilliant comic and a brilliant movie. It explores politics, ethics, deviant sexuality and still contains a great superhero vibe for those who just like butt-kicking. The graphic novel was a landmark achievement, and after years of handing the script from one person to another, Zack Snyder has emerged as the man capable of putting it together, and impressing us all. Few adaptations do justice to the original, but ""Watchmen"" does an amazing job. As an added bonus, largely unknown actors were cast... not creating a distraction of one character over another when all (or at least most) have their own unique, important tales to tell.<br/><br/>The political aspects are numerous -- nuclear war, Soviet versus American aggression, the term limits of presidents, vigilantism and the Keene Act (paralleling the X-Men's ""Days of Future"" storyline). But it is the moral aspect that really tugs at me. ""Let justice be done, though the whole world perish"" is a quote from Immanuel Kant, but it could apply to Rorshach. He is debatably the hero of the story with a strongly defined morality (Kant's consequentionalism) blended with seeming insanity, though he is the only one trying to make the world better one person at a time.<br/><br/>A very extreme utilitarianism emerges in one of the characters towards the end -- can we sacrifice the few to save the many? Rorshach would clearly oppose this, but if the outcome is positive, can the action be justified? This poses a difficult problem for the viewer and the characters, because the action is so heinous yet the outcome so bountiful... is it wrong or necessarily right? (I'd be more specific and address this more, but I don't wish to give away the plot.) While ""Spiderman"" and ""X-Men"" get all the attention, it is films like ""Watchmen"" that leave a lasting impression in my mind (""The Spirit"", too). Even ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Batman Begins"", which are incredible, don't have the power to keep the conversation going hours, days and weeks after viewing them. If you were considering seeing ""Watchmen"" but haven't yet, make it a top priority -- this is a film to end all films."

The sci-fi and fantasy genre is going through its dark ages, we either revive the classics or build completely stupid stories just for kids (Lord of the Rings may be an exception, but think of Narnia and Harry Potter).<br/><br/>As said before, this movie can only be appreciated by two types of folks: - those that have read the book and like it (nevertheless they will complain over and over and over because sequence A did not match passage A of the book: It's and ADAPTATION for Christ's sake, not a point to point copy) - those that come from art school (or those that wish they did) and appreciate those pseudo-intellectual bits of film-making I am neither, and so I feel disappointed because if you look into this movie as a stand-alone creation you can only conclude that the story makes absolutely no sense. Of course that doesn't matter because he (the director) was only adapting the book, so if the script is absurd that is a transcendent matter...<br/><br/>Just to finish, a word to those that comment on the special effects and action scenes: (1) any movie made in 2009 has automatically good special effects if given enough budget, so no need to point it out actually (2) good action is like what you should seek in cartoons when you are 10 years old... grow up.<br/><br/>Scoring 2/10 just because this director is actually talented, but the movie is stupidly over-rated!"

My first thought after I found out what Ozymandias did was, ""Wait... he *did* it?"" Each character has such different moral guidelines, each character is superbly well cast. And the special effects? It's kinda gross, but darn these are great effects.<br/><br/>I can't even put into words how much I loved this movie. It was excellent.<br/><br/>I will say, though, that in the book and the movie Dan Dreiburg is weird. He has an UNHEALTHY obsession with owls. Make sure to pay attention to that. Everything he does has to do with owls. :)"

","Seeing this in the theater on opening day was probably one of the greatest movie experiences in a lifetime. It's unfortunate that this movie had a 75% drop in its theatrical run after a successful opening, but not every movie is #1 5 weeks in a row, right? Watchmen is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It's a very well done adaptation. I've read the graphic novel twice, so I was excited to see this movie.<br/><br/>And what an awesome movie it was! I was a bit skeptical about the almost 3-hour length (I don't have A.D.D), but in the end I was completely satisfied. I saw it with 3 people who hadn't read the graphic novel, and they even loved it too. I was very shocked though that there were kids at this movie, as if the rating 18A for ""Gory Scenes, Brutal Violence"" wasn't enough of a warning? The year is 1985. Nuclear War is a high threat. The doomsday clock has been set to 5 minutes to midnight. And an ex-superhero has been murdered. The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has been thrown out a window to his death. Upon this happening, the minutemen, now called the Watchmen, a washed-up ex-ensemble of superheroes has reunited to to one thing- save the world from nuclear threat.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a brilliant movie. At 2 hours and 43 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. In fact I actually didn't want it to end. The entire cast was brilliant. The movie isn't as humorless as everyone says it is, there's lots of dry humor where appropriate, there is lots of action, and another thing is that it fits the ""problems of society"" feel that the comic created. Also the omissions were not as bad as people are exaggerating it to be- I must admit I liked the changed ending a lot better than the book ending. It's more realistic, and I must admit the book ending made me go ""WTF"".<br/><br/>I shall warn you though, this movie is very violent and gory. I am a gorehound, and I found myself cringing and going ""Ewwwwww"" at a few bits. Do not see this if you are squeamish, because it IS very brutal and gruesome stuff.<br/><br/>So overall, I have not one single complaint about this film, because it's an amazing work of art. This is brutal and and gruesome stuff that if hard to watch, and I love it. Consider it Snyder's masterpiece! I can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray when it comes out!"
"SinglePlex","7","3","8","4 May 2009"," Great cinema!
","This is a wonderful piece of cinema. As a comic-book turned into film, I found it even more satisfying than ""300 (2006)"". Zack Snyder has the rare ability to humble himself before the original artist. He works like a converter, giving life to the comic book pages without adding any interpretation or look-at-me moments of his own. Every frame looks exactly like it does in the books. More importantly, he did not get tempted to ""modernise"" the story. Retaining the Nixon, Vietnam and other references kept the story real for both fans of ""Watchmen"" and people who have only heard of this classic.<br/><br/>The only group that seems to have trashed the movie are journalists (no surprises there!) and people with no prior context of the book-- neither as art, nor as a statement. They tended to equate this with the usual Spiderman and Power Rangers variety of comic-book films, concluding that this movie came out wanting. I came here today when I read a reference in a Wolverine review, comparing its poor reception to the dud that was Watchmen. Gee, how they missed the point!! Wolverine was just lazy film-making, a badly made film with no story/plot/point. Merely squeezing what they could from the stale franchise. Watchmen, on the other hand, is a well-made movie with painstaking attention to detail and incredibly faithful to the source. Comparing the two only justifies the closing of newspapers across the US-- traditional journalists do not seem to go beyond the official Kool-Aid. Whether it is movie reviews or supporting the Iraq war, they merely parrot what appears to them as the ""acceptable"" view.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a great movie and a must-watch. By anyone over 16 :-)"
"The_Rogue_Phoenix","8","3","8","20 April 2009"," Who Watches the Watchmen? We Should
","Personally, I was not anticipating Watchmen quite as much as my friends. They all read the cultish DC Comics graphic novel while I hadn't. It seems that everyone who reads it somehow has a life changing experience. I went to the packed midnight showing of its release, surrounded by college students, with hope that the film adaptation would prove the same for me. I have a personal affinity with comic books and superhero movies, but until Watchmen I'd never seen a true comic book film. Through stunning visuals it goes above and beyond, making the superhero film into the piece of art it always should have been. <br/><br/>It opens with a chilling scene of a vicious super powered fight, backed by Nat King Cole's gentle ""Unforgettable."" The story revolves around the mystery of who killed the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a former costumed ""superhero"" and former member of the disbanded Watchmen. We follow the vigilante Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), another former Watchman, who investigates the murder case. The story behind the Comedian unfolds through a series of flashbacks revealing only more puzzling information. Watchmen takes us to an alternate 1985 in which America won the Vietnam war and Nixon is in his fifth term. The story does not raise this film above the standard by itself, but it does so through the themes, issues, and questions it calls to mind.<br/><br/>The film contains excusable infractions from the poor makeup job of Nixon's nose to the awkward and laughable sex scenes. I couldn't stand the use of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" to score the sex scene between Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) and Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson). The context of its use turned a sweet ballad into what sounded like a sexified, Barry White-esquire rendition. If anything the audience found amusement at the awkwardness of the creative sexual encounters; it's uncomfortable but entertaining.<br/><br/>Underlying the film are thought provoking themes other superhero movies don't dare to explore. It redefines the ""superhero"" from savior to human, not only in the realm of making mistakes but the capacity to do wrong. Other films barely touch on this idea from Spider-man's human weaknesses to Batman in Dark Knight straddling the line between hero and vigilante, but they're both inherently good. The audience doesn't disagree with their actions or motives. The ""heroes"" in Watchmen prove that though they save the day, they can be just as selfish, unforgiving, and murderous as those who oppose them. It makes the point that every hero is one choice away from becoming a ""villain."" Heroes can't always make the right choice. As Rorschach says oh so poetically, ""Humans are savage in nature."" I'm afraid that some casual viewers of Watchmen didn't quite appreciate or grasp the concepts that I found so intriguing. They were too distracted by Dr. Manhattan's glowing blue penis, the apparent ""randomness"" of the music choices, and the lengthiness of the film. I barely noticed the nudity because I was too distracted by the characters and social commentary. The music suited the time period and captured the intended emotions, and I never once wondered when the movie was going to end. I suppose this extreme thematic exploration is a little out of its time for some, especially for those who have not read the original graphic novel.<br/><br/>Viewers agree that the look of the film made an impression. Even if they don't enjoy the mystery or the damned but redeemable characters, the visuals are truly stunning and hypnotic. Director Zack Snyder caters to comic readers by striving for artistic mimicry in imitating specific panels from the graphic novel. The drastic color scheme creates a mesmerizing, innovative style, pleasing to the eye and reminiscent of comic art. The visual approach is apparent from the opening credit sequence. Through iconic, almost photographic stills Snyder elegantly presents the superheroes' history. It effectively introduces the audience to the world of the Watchmen. Brutal violence is beautified through split second slowmo shots to enhance powerful punches and emphasize the bright, agonizing gore. The fight scene choreography feels like watching a comic book in action, showing the audience every hit, every bullet wound, every blood splatter. The film utilizes its parent text by truly capturing the comic book on screen.<br/><br/>Whether it's colorful, chilling scenes of graphic violence, various ex-superheroes representing the best and worst of humanity, or a whodunit mystery, Watchmen proves to be a ride of pure adrenaline. It'll make you squirm, laugh, gasp, and most importantly think. In a flashback, the Comedian says, ""I thought I knew how the world was"" but none of us seem to know. Watch the Watchmen and maybe you'll feel enlightened, maybe disturbed, but it'll make you feel. Not only is it a must see; it's worth re-watching."
"classicsoncall","10","3","8","14 March 2009"," ""In my opinion, the existence of life is a highly overrated phenomenon.""
","In anticipation of the movie, I read ""Watchmen"" just about a month ago, it was my fourth time. Each time, I came away with a greater understanding of the characters and story, in no small part due to the extensive narrative offered as backup to the panels one most closely associates with the comic book medium. To enjoy the movie, I don't think it's a prerequisite to read the book first, but I will say this - a viewer going in cold will have no idea that some of the scenes in the opening montage preface events in the story, like the young Laurie Jupiter watching her mother argue with her then husband (who wasn't revealed by name in the movie version). I think having that insight only brings a greater satisfaction to the viewer who has an insider's understanding of where the story is going.<br/><br/>What most impresses me with the film adaptation was director Zack Snyder's attention to detail, reminiscent of the same way he approached ""300"", another graphic novel by veteran writer Frank Miller. Granted, the ending, which many devotees of Moore will find fault with, is somewhat different from the original, but I was left entirely satisfied with the way the movie handled it. So much so, that I was left wondering why Moore hadn't come up with a similar ending himself, it seemed to make a whole lot more sense given the attention to Dr. Manhattan's self imposed off planet exile. Even in the graphic novel version, the alien creature construct ('the squid'), seemed clunky, perhaps more so in the artwork then in the concept. I say this after the fact of course; upon an initial reading, the story flows quite logically in regard to Ozymandias' scheme to defuse tension between the world powers.<br/><br/>What truly amazed me about the movie was how the entire back story of the characters meshed perfectly with events happening now, with no disconnect to the chapters of the original graphic novel. That, and the virtually perfect casting of actors for the lead roles. The only character that I had some trouble with was Matthew Goode's portrayal of Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, I was expecting someone a little older and perhaps a bit huskier in physique. But Billy Crudup, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, and especially Jackie Earle Haley were perfect choices for their characters. Put Heath Ledger's Joker up against Haley's Rorschach and I think you'd be hard pressed to come up with a clear winner. The role of Laurie Jupiter could probably have been handled competently by any number of current young actresses, but with all said and done, Malin Akerman did just fine. <br/><br/>As for the run time of nearly three hours, I might be in the minority on this, but I didn't have a problem with the length and pacing of the picture at all. In fact, I'm looking forward to the extended version when it eventually comes out on DVD. I don't understand why movie goers seem to have a problem with anything much over ninety minutes or so; for my money, as long as the quality matches the content, more is always better by me. I mean after all, I'm going to a film to escape for a brief time from some of the lunacy going on in the world, so keeping me in my seat for an additional hour isn't the worst that could happen. <br/><br/>With minor nods to the present, the ""Watchmen"" set in the mid 1980's doesn't seem like it would be much different from a fictional universe set in the present day. I'm thinking specifically about the notion of super power rivalry over finite resources and energy supply, and the ever elusive concept of a just and lasting peace between the major players on the world stage. In that regard, I'm reminded of a similar theme at the center of a movie that came out more than a half century ago. In ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" (1951), the Earth's major powers were faced with the threat of annihilation from an alien source if they persisted in continuing a rivalry that might lead to nuclear annihilation. The Ozymandias solution, for all it's intended 'good' effort to sacrifice millions to save billions, in the end would never achieve success for the simple reason posited in the graphic novel by Dr. Manhattan, and in the movie by Laurie to Dreiberg in a closing scene - Nothing ends, nothing ever ends..."" For all his effort, Adrian Veidt achieved only a temporary goal."

","I can't say enough about Watchmen. There was moments in the movie where i was a little confused on why things were happening and what was going on, but it all makes sense in the end. I have not read the GN yet, but just as a movie, I thought Watchmen was phenomenal. I went with four of my friends. We are all about 18. Three of us are into movies and pretty mature, and the other two aren't so much. The two immature kids walked out of the movie saying ""That was F^$%#&# weird!!"" The other three of us however loved it. In the words of my one friend, ""it is more philosophical than The Bible"" (exaggeration). Some things i would've changed about it. The beginning when they are showing all the old Watchmen as the credits are going. It seemed like it was meant to be comical and that really wasn't the vibe of the movie, especially the music that was playing. Also, the sex scene was about five minutes too long."
"band_animal_09","10","3","8","10 March 2009"," This is one Amazing Movie!
","I must say that I in fact loved this movie. A lot of my friends at school had been talking about it and I had seen the book pop up a few times. I never really thought much of it until I went and saw a movie with my fiancée and we saw the preview for it. And better yet, it came out on my birthday! I eventually got hold of the book and two days before the opening of the movie, I read and finished it with only an hour left until I was going to see it. I was pretty much bouncing up and down in car with excitement to see the movie. Once I got in the theater, I couldn't look away from the screen throughout the entire movie. Everything about it made me sit on the edge of seat and it kept my attention during the entire 2 hours and 43 minutes. Ever since I saw it, I can't stop thinking about it and I can't wait to go and see it again this weekend!!"
"mazmorrero02","8","3","8","9 March 2009"," A new perspective of vigilantes
","If you got tired of movies in which only special effects are the attractive, Watchmen is a suitable option. The film reflects that we can never entirely leave our past behind, because sooner or later we'll have to meet again with it. The main characters are very realistic, because they don't fight crime because it's their responsibility or for defending justice, they do it because they're as twisted as the enemies they fight, or because they have serious self esteem issues, so they feel better killing and fighting, even torturing. The heroes are the villains at the same time. Particularly, Rorschach is the best character. He is a psycho-vigilante that won't be tolerant with the scum that surrounds him, so he behaves extremely violent with it because he knows the society is doomed. As a plus, the violent fight scenes are greatly filmed, just like in 300. It will probably be one of the best films of 2009."

However this thankfully did not affect how I saw the movie and in fact exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>I originally walked in thinking I was going to see a movie like Spider-man and Batman. However, I actually saw something beyond that. It's actually more political than an action movie and I think that's what made the movie enjoyable. It's nice to see a super hero movie that's not all about crime fighting.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I must say that it was well worth sneaking into seeing. It is also worth your butt going numb.

Personal opinion, the action sequences in the trailer are the only action sequences in this 3 hour movie. Huge disappointment.<br/><br/>I gave it 3 stars because the acting was good. Maybe if I knew going in I would be watching a drama I wouldn't have been so disappointed.

"princein_cantor","9","3","8","8 March 2009"," Thumbs up from a fan of the novel
","Zack Snyder gives us a faithful comic book adaption, but the only problem is it's not a comic book. I know it's ridiculous to assert that a 2 ½ hour movie doesn't go deep enough, but that's just it, he stretches himself too thin. By trying to cover every facet of the novel he reduces the movie to a rail road of stylish events and set pieces. He has all the threads; he just doesn't weave them into a satisfying story. In terms of craftsmanship, it is one of the best movies I've seen, surpassing the Dark Knight in cinema photography and set design. Add to that an awesome sound track and powerful performances and you have a marvel which will stick in peoples' minds for a long time.<br/><br/>What makes this movie unique is not only is it well adapted, but the stuff that Synder adds in is on par with the original content. The opening fight between the ""Comedian"" and an unknown assailant is a prime example of this. Also his interpretation of Rorschach's mental breakdown is chilling in how graphic it is.<br/><br/>The cinema photography was excellent given the fact each shot was done individually to assure quality. The set designs are nothing short of perfect, leaving plenty of Easter eggs for fans of the graphic novel to find. Note: Did anyone notice the file on Veidt's computer that said ""boys""? That was strange.<br/><br/>The sound track is the best I've heard in awhile with songs that include ""The Sound of Silence"" ""All Along the Watch Tower"" and ""the Times They Are a Changing."" Of course you can find any of these songs on a mix CD; the point of a sound track is to compliment the visuals. While for the most part each song sets the mood and era, there are times where the audio doesn't quite match the pace or tone of a scene.<br/><br/>Jackie Earl Haley gives us an unsettling performance as the deranged masked vigilante ""Rorschach"" and actually ends up being scarier without his mask. Billy Crudup is next in line for best performance as the eerie blue super god, ""Doctor Manhattan."" His reserved manner and powerful presence is often betrayed by subtle facial twinges that remind us he is human. Although lacking in screen time, Jeffery Dean Morgan's ""Comedian"" gets honorable mention, he plays an obnoxious son of a bitch you can't help, but respond to.<br/><br/>In the end the movie collapses under the weight of its own scope, by taking on too much it did not say enough. We get glimpses of complex characters and snatches of plot to keep it coherent, but the audience never feels included. While this sounds negative rest assured it's not, read: Zack Snyder made the best adaption possible. Had he decided to focus on just Rorschach or just the Nite Owl it would have had more focus, but then it would have ceased to be a great adaption. Like a friend of mine said it's not ""the Rorschach movie"" or ""the Nite Owl movie"" it's ""The Watchmen."" And Zack Snyder gives us just that."

That were the 2 1/2 hours of my life wasted. Such a weak script and very bad editing. I mean it was like watching some armature film maker work which just didn't seem to end. Cant believe that Zack would make this after a decent film like 300. First half hour of the film were spent arguing with myself that this film was going to get better and during the last half hour I was about to pull out my hair, out of disappointment and disbelief. I mean talk about mindless sex scenes and aimless violence.<br/><br/>God help us all."

","There are three kinds of people in the world. 1 - People who haven't read Watchmen 2 - People who have read Watchmen and understood the complex philosophy that goes into it. 3 - People who have read Watchmen and liked the film.<br/><br/>This is a comment section for people who have read and loved the graphic novel. Zack Snyder is not the right director for this film. I think it would be fare to say that he butchered the 'dawn of the dead' name when he turned George A. Romero's insightful look into a materialistic 80's America into a gore fest for cretins. '300' was, and shall remain Snyder's masterpiece. This is because it played to all his strengths, being only a beautiful series of scenes involving slow motion. All those fan boys out there, like I was when I went to see the film, will be sick to hear this film has been given the same treatment.<br/><br/>Snyder manages to not only substitute plot and story for CG effects, but also good actors for a pretty face. I challenge anyone to watch this film and tell me that they think Malin Akerman (Silk Spectre 2) was even half good. Her wooden style of acting pulled me out of the experience every time I managed to get past the irritating soundtrack and rubbish blue Dr. Manhattan (who looked incredibly superimposed and like a Pixar character).<br/><br/>However, maybe I am judging this film too harshly. I knew along time ago that this film would never been as good as Watchmen the Graphic novel. Maybe I need to lighten up and take it for what it is, an action film with a super villain. Maybe? No. I don't think people would be so accepting if '300' were changed so that it was an intense political thriller rather than a blood bath. Watchmen therefore shouldn't be treated as a simple mystery action flick. Sure it has the clever ending twist that asks the most interesting philosophical question in the book, but the whole story is thick with questions like these, all of which are by past to make room for slow motion fight scenes. There is actually a scene where Dan Dreiberg puts out a fire with a mini gun! Does this sound like the work of Allan Moore to you? No, it sounds like the work of Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>Again I apologize for turning into a comic book fan boy. If I'm being completely honest I didn't hate the film. It's just hard to watch something you know could be done so much better. This little review thing if for fan boys only. If you've not read the book, you're missing out. If you have and you still think this film is on the same level as it, get your head examined."
"canadianradio","10","3","8","7 March 2009"," What Watchmen Means To Me
","I first read Watchmen my senior year of college. I hadn't really read comics at any earlier point in my life, and it was one of the first dozen books I bought when I got into them. Warner Brothers took a chance on this film that took so long to happen and I applaud them and Zack Snyder for their efforts, but by the pure nature of the medium an audience member simply doesn't get as much information about the characters as they would if they sat down and read the book, and in a one-of-a-kind superhero story like this, character development is everything.<br/><br/>It seems that the film has generated a love-it-or-hate-it reaction all over the internet. Whenever I read a review by someone that didn't like Watchmen, their complaints are generally about events and characters they didn't understand, mainly Dr. Manhattan.<br/><br/>Most films about superheroes these days have some kind of plot device to explain to the audience exactly what these people can do, i.e. Lois Lane listing off each and every one of Superman's powers. Therefore, when an omnipotent being like Dr. Manhattan is shown hovering clothes in the air one minute and teleporting to Mars the next, the unsuspecting viewer can react unpleasantly because it is not a concept they've been trained to understand. They argue that it isn't believable that a character would do that. As it turns out, people like that don't often become storytellers.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan's limitless power completely separates him from everyone else on Earth, and feeling no connection to it, he initially has no incentive to stop the planet's self-destruction. After eventually learning about love and humanity over decades of destruction, he decides to intervene but finds that he was too late. Ultimately he decides to travel to another galaxy and create life on his own. But where does he go and what happens next? What happens to Earth? What becomes of Manhattan's world? Could it be our own? It's possible, seeing as how the Earth depicted in Watchmen is clearly not the one we live in. So if you're desperately trying to find a way to relate to this movie and would like an easy frame of reference, just keep this in mind: Watchmen is an origin story for God."
"imdb-10463","6","4","13","4 March 2009"," Too much material for one film
","Watchmen opened in Switzerland today and I caught one of the first screenings in Geneva.<br/><br/>It was a disappointment.<br/><br/>Those who've read the book will find it a shallow reflection of the original graphic novel. Some scenes are taken almost panel for panel from the book and a number of these are done very well. But the fundamental problem remains that even with over two hours running time there simply isn't enough time to explore the depth of the book. Major themes are heavily modified or completely absent, and equally often short cuts are taken. Much of the moral interest is lost and relations between the characters are hastily compressed into two or three lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>The same hasty treatment of the themes and characters are likely to confuse those who haven't read the book. Time and location changes quickly, both forward and backward, but with little clue to the viewer as to what is happening. We're given no reason to care about the characters, and the plot is tediously slow until it is suddenly explained in exposition at the end.<br/><br/>It evoked a couple of short laughs but for most of the film the audience was silent. As soon as the film finished everyone headed straight for the exit. Not a good sign.<br/><br/>Maybe a new, longer cut will repair some of the glaring flaws in this release. Until then, you'll have more fun reading the book."

","I haven't read the original graphic novel yet but I sure hope it's better than the movie! All movies are of course contrived but the trick is not to make it obvious. This production is one dimensional, unimaginative and predictable. The characters are thin, unengaging and unlikely to encourage any empathy. There is no subtlety and the movie is heavily reliant on stylised violence. A successful film surprises us but Watchmen is embarrassingly predictable. Instead of an impressive, creative interpretation of a story we get something that is all technique and no substance. Immediately disappointing and ultimately immature."
"asda-man","2","3","9","16 August 2011"," Made by nerds, about nerds, for nerds
","Superheroes aren't my things at all, I like ""Spiderman"" because it's fun nd doesn't take itself too seriously and I like ""Batman Begins"" for the opposite reason that it's very dark, realistic and adult-like. So I heard about ""Watchmen"" how good it was and how bloody violent it is and decided to give it a go. The opening was absolutely incredible, the cinematography and stylish directing blew me away. The title sequence was also really great, directed flawlessly. I have seen Zack's version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and really enjoyed it and so my hopes were suddenly rising for our dear ""Watchmen"" with it's beautiful opening shots but it all ends there.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the comic of ""Watchmen"" I have never read a comic in my life apart from the funny ones in the newspaper, but not Fred Basset he's crap! So I didn't know what I was letting myself in for, I'm all about trying new things and I always go into a film with an open mind but either my mind wasn't opened enough or the film was simply a load of rubbish! Darren Aronofsky my favourite director was up for directing this but turned it down along with other countless directors for it's complicity and now I can see why. A man with an inaudible croaky voice jumps up wearing a mask with moving black splodges and I'm meant to take this seriously? When the blue man came on I began to really doubt this film.<br/><br/>Call me crooked but ""Watchmen"" did have the potential to be really fun. From the opening scene I was expecting complete ""Sin City"" style action throughout! Which would've been really fun. But instead it had been ruined by taking itself dreadfully seriously. No one can't say they didn't have a chuckle to themselves about the glowing blue man with the ridiculous animated penis! He moved it moved! The whole film was ridiculous really and we'r meant to believe all this. I can list countless things that are laughable like President Nixon looking like David Walliems as Omar from ""Come Fly With Me"" but that would be a waste of time, because I don't think the word count is big enough.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" does look like it's meant for kids, but it clearly isn't with it's violence (sometimes insanely!) and themes such as rape and paedophilia along with a very untasteful sex scene. Yet it can't be for adults because were watching men dressed up as superheroes! I look at ""Watchmen"" as a confused child, it doesn't know what it wants to be or what it's trying to do, so it just lingers annoyingly by your feet until you want to kick it in the stomach. The screenplay just crams far too much in the already frighteningly long running time (it feels longer) so you just don't know where you are or what's going on. The flashbacks were the only thing that interested me in the film, it seemed as it ""Watchmen"" would've been a hell of a lot more compelling with the back-story being told instead of this confusing and depressing lark about the heroes reuniting! It's also quite sexist, with the women superheroes being dressed in tight leather swim suits just so the geeks who are interested in the film can weirdly drool at her. There are strokes of interest, some of the action is stylishly filmed but for an action film ,there is hardly any action in it! It then decides to be brutishly violent for the sake of it, just to remind us this is meant to be an adults film.<br/><br/>With a complete mish-mash of plot (is there a plot) and absolutely ridiculous dialogue such as when the lady is sleeping with the blue man as multiple blue hands caress her mouth she says ""it's like tasting a battery"". It's depressing Hollywood rubbish. It reminds me of ""The Incredibles"" with all the fun being completely sucked out of it. ""Watchmen"" is something that can't be fixed because it seems as if the original comic was already smashed to pieces. The opening seemed like it had potential (which is why I'm giving it a 2/10 instead of 1) bu then fell flat on its face. ""Watchmen"" is unwatchable."
"rhykid","2","3","9","11 July 2010"," How could a film be this boring?
","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>OK i just wanna start with asking; how can so many people like this film? I really did believe this film would be good. Action, superheros, violence and dark themes.<br/><br/>What it ACTUALLY turned out to be was a film about some blue guy with god-like powers who walks around with his tiny, radioactive, flaccid penis hanging out almost the whole film continuously changing his opinion on the human race. Not to mention the monotone narrator; Rorschach who has a voice that sounds as if he has been smoking for 80 years and has had throat cancer 10 times. Already these things together make the film horrible but no, there's more!<br/><br/>Other main characters include: A cowardice, nerdy ripoff of batman, a complete douchebag who has a cigar with a seemingly infinite amount of tobacco in it and a woman with pretty much no unique characteristics who, after her partner; Dr. Manhattan (the blue guy) tries to insert one of his multiple penises into her anus, cheats on him with the nerdy batman wannabe.<br/><br/>The script was the most cliché'd boring thing I've ever heard in my lifetime, the characters sucked as none of them actually had super powers thus pretty much rendering this 'Superhero' film into a mere 'Hero' film.<br/><br/>With the exception of Dr.Manhattan who isn't actually a hero. Actually if anything; he is a villain because he makes people get cancer. This indecisive character goes from being a scientist and trying to benefit mankind to being upset and feeling bad for giving people cancer to then having a strop and sitting on mars living in his random, giant, floating... Thing and saying he doesn't care about mankind to killing Rorschach to give peace on Earth to then having another strop and saying hes leaving and never coming back. If Dr.Manhattan can do everything, why cant he cure the people of cancer? Oh yeah i know why; because the film is terrible and the script writer completely sucks and doesn't know what a plot hole is.<br/><br/>Rorschach, who is debatably the main character, is basically a criminal as he ends up in prison somehow, who seemingly has a serious throat disorder, a messed up childhood and is now someone who has no friends at all who constantly talks non-stop about his crappy life and wears a mask that has a moving graphic on it. Well thank god for the mask because when he takes it off you see his true face which is basically like a ginger, junkie who hasn't bathed since he was 9. Although i hate this character more than some, he does actually have the privilege of having the best.. No... The ONLY good scene in the whole film. Yes, brace yourself... An ACTION scene. I know right! An action scene in a movie about hero's? How strange. Yes this scene where Rorschach breaks out of prison is actually GOOD. Wow thank god. 10 minutes of good in a film that is 2 and a half hours long. That is of course assuming your watching the kindest version of the film. There is believe it or not, two other versions. One of which plays for 24 minutes longer than the original and another which should be called 'The Nightmare Edition' which plays for a total of 215 minutes long. Yes. 3 hours and 35 minutes long. I didn't even know the human brain could endure such boredom without shutting down. Then again, i have seen the film Joshua, which was undoubtedly much more boring.<br/><br/>There is so much more i could say but i don't want to waste anymore time even thinking about this atrocious piece of crap.<br/><br/>I know my opinions are very strong but i seriously hated this film with such a burning passion that i had to share my opinions somewhere.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, i thought this film was painfully uninteresting and boring, annoyingly bad characters, too long, had only one good scene, good mood setting screenplay but overall just plain terrible. And for that, i give it two stars out of ten."
"Homeric","10","3","9","21 May 2010"," Two Kinds of People
","There appear to be two kinds of people: those who love this film and those who hate it with a passion. I am in the former group. That said, I do think that the film could have been better and that it has one flaw: the ending.<br/><br/>Let me state, I have not read the graphic novel so my views are based solely on what is on the screen.<br/><br/>The ending is basically this: the world's smartest man, and the world's only indestructible man who can transport himself anywhere in the universe and can alter matter at will, can think of only one way to save the world from nuclear destruction...by the mass murder of some 15 million people. That's it? That's the best these two near gods can come up with? How about this....let's see, the indestructible guy tele-transports himself all over the world to wherever there are nuclear weapons, missiles, etc. and then turns them all into ice cream cones. How about that? And the world's smartest guy actually uses his brains to communicate with ""the people"" and convince them that Nixon and others are leading the country to the brink of destruction. How about that? I mean if I take these two characters at face value, then the ending presented is absurd.<br/><br/>As I said in the beginning, I love this movie. It holds my attention all the way through. I love the two main characters who ""find one another"" and wind up as a couple. But the ending sucks. I still give it 10 for 10 because it is so much better than most of the crap being made these days.<br/><br/>As for those who really really hate this movie I think I understand...the movies you like I would probably hate...people have different tastes, nothing wrong (or right) about that."
"tyranid_slayer","9","3","9","13 April 2009"," Never compromise, Not even in the face of Armageddon!
","So last year in 2008 after seeing the spectacular super-hero movies Iron Man and The Dark Knight you could only worry that the next super-hero movie, Watchmen, could live up to the expectations that the fanboys like me craved. So yeah i'm a watchmen fanboy. And its finally here on time after all the court debates. So Watchmen the movie is essentially like Watchmen the graphic novel but played out in motion. It's like Sin City in that it is the perfect adaption, all dialouge and scenes are pretty much intact or unchanged which is good. Zack Snyders reach doesn't exceed his grasp he knows what hes doing it and does it for the fans. He knew whether or not to change certain things or expand on them. The cast was something of a mystery. When the first photos of the characters were released i looked rather bewildered. The only really recognisable name in the credits was Jeffery Dean Morgan. But the cast choices (like all comic book adaptions) were very spot on. Matthew Goode was okay as ozymandias and Nite Owl was okay too. Malin Akerman, aside from her obvious good looks, was pretty good and could handle her role well enough. But special acting merit really go to Jeffery Dean Morgan, Jackie Earl Haley and Billy Crudup. Rorscach is my favourite character from the book and you cant help but worry that an actor might screw up your favourite character (ryan reynolds if you screw up deadpool i will kill you) but Jackie Earl portrayed rorscach the way the fans know him. Jeffery Dean Morgan as the comedian was an excellent choice, he really captured the craziness and instability of the character.And Billy Crudup as Dr.Manhatten. Dr.Manhatten is an odd character, he is never actually with the humans he sees outside the human realm of existence in a sense. And Crudup managed to capture the characters sense of ""out of the box"". The book was never action packed. But the trailers kind of made the film out to be. How disappointed the lesser minds would have been. Zack Snyder, like i said before, knows what hes doing, he added in action scenes where necessary and didn't blow them completely out of proportion. And in watchmen the book the story and characters are just the bones of the greater fiction, the meat of the book is the themes and messages of humanity and vigilantism and how they affect us in modern society. These themes and messages remain unscathed. The one problem i had with the film was the changing of the ending. While the change wasn't amazingly drastic and kept in the same vein of the book it was still quite a departure. I don't see why they couldn't have kept the ending from the book anyway. At around 3 hours long it has good pacing and builds and creates its scenes well and doest waffle around with unimportant plot devices. So all in all this is a great movie for the fans but even my friend who hasn't read the book loved it so it may even appeal to some total wacthmen n00bs. Peace out"
"Samiyagenyo","9","3","9","9 March 2009"," Well, hmm. . . Yeah!!!
","Since the very first murmur of ""Watchmen"" being made into a movie, there has been doubt and excitement running around my mind. Doubt, the graphic novel, as many have said, is cruel, down to earth, incredibly dense, and a lot to take in. I heard it described as the riskiest super hero movie, ever to be made. Plus the ending of the film is not for the ""Spiderman"" and ""Fantastic 4"" lovers. It's incredibly (love that word) dark, and esoteric in its own sense. Those were my only doubts. My excitement, coming from mostly Zach Snyder, possibly one of my all time favorite director, which each of his films play through my mind constantly. I sometimes watch each one several times a week, just to psycho-analyze it. (yes, I'm a film maker)And he makes a lot of smart moves in difficult places. The other thing, getting me pumped was. . . well. . .Rorschach, I know, I'm a sucker for a bad ass, but he was one a huge part of me seeing the movie. I didn't even pay any mind to the ""R"" rating until the movie started and went ""Woah, how Snyder-esquire"" And Snyder used the crap out of his ""300"" style fighting. Bad thing? not necessarily, it's almost his signature in a way. . . Before I go any further, I just have to ask. . What the hell is with the soundtrack. I don't think I've ever seen a soundtrack. . . as unique as this. I can see what was trying to be done with it, and I'm all for dark humor, and that form of Sarcasm, but the silly music got old after a while. There could have been a better soundtrack for this movie, obviously, me, being a metal-head, could have definitely used a little metal, and heavier music. But seeing as it didn't happen, I'll stop with the ""What If's"" and move on. The Special effects were jut wonderful, if I ever get excited for a movie, I usually look up info, and videos prior to the release of said film, and I sometimes learn a lot about how it's made. And I have to say, Zach Snyder has always been very revolutionary with his tactics, but this film took it to a new level. The whole time before the movie came out, I was wondering how they would do Rorshach's ever changing mask. Or Dr.Manhattan's. . . glowiness. . .ess. One thing about Manhattan, erm, nudity, was that it wasn't overly accentuated, or wasn't trying to be made vague either, which was very well done. It was a subtle mix between ""in your face""(hahaha) ""Don't look at his wiener"". The violence can be described only as. . . gratuitous (another great word). Again, staying true to the Snyder mantra. It was at time, a bit over done, the prison arm-cutting scene. Made me cringe and smile at the same time. Not a lot of violent scenes can make me cringe. (I'm a Saw fan. . .soooo)Manhattan exploding people was a little twisted (loved it) and Rorshach's less than heroic tactics of disposing of villains. This all spelled ""R"" ( Not to mention the porno-like ""300"" style sex scene)But, then again, I don't think a film adaption of Watchmen could be any other rating. In the end, I'm not going to go to deep into it, but I was very impressed with it, not only as a standalone film, but also as a wonderful adaption. Zach Snyder, my good friend. . . Keep it up. :D -Sam Miller"
"gort-8","10","3","9","9 March 2009"," Amazing!
","When I saw WATCHMEN I had a reaction that I sadly seldom have with films today. My mind raced with a single burning question - ""When can I see this again?"" I'd been hearing of Alan Moore's graphic novel for years. People would talk about it in reverential tones. When I'd confess that I had never read it they'd give me a piteous look and, with the passion of true believers, urge me to read it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Three years ago I did. When I finished I thought that, if anything, their praise simply wasn't lofty enough! This is a masterwork.<br/><br/>I held me breath at the prospect of someone trying to catch that lightening in a bottle. The cinematic road is littered with the bones of worthless suitors who've taken on the name of great works but not the heart.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder captured it completely. I have tried to describe it to others who haven't seen it. I'm frustrated at my lack of vocabulary in appraising this film. I keep using the word ""amazing"" over and over. Across the pages of a thousand thesauruses there must be other more adequate words. None come to mind.<br/><br/>See this movie. It's amazing!"
"iso-kincses","10","3","9","6 March 2009"," Almost Perfect
","I have already shared some of my sulky after-movie rants here when I expected more from a comic book (or graphic novel) adaptation, and I thought while they are making films for profit they wont allow to lose megabucks in favor of some graphic violence. Never mind four letter words or sexually explicit scenes, which probably fall under more strict classification, maybe because they make a character more realistic (and Hollywood wouldn't want to be blamed for some kids getting mixed up between reality and the virtual universe), or more likely it's just the usual hypocrisy. <br/><br/>And now we can see it in full blow: aged ex-heroine boozing at two in afternoon, a physicist turned into a god-like creature who starts to develop god-like aloofness towards mankind, and a violent macho symbolising America's usually concealed or denied fascism and superiority complex. Mind you these are some of the good guys we're talking about! There are some more good guys with a little more touch of the boy scout creed of an average superhero but they wont be caught feeling squeamish about shedding blood and wont say crap instead of f**k, either. (They even do it not just say it!)<br/><br/>The cold war's atmosphere is captivating, but there's even more to it than the paranoid fear of a once highly potential nuclear holocaust. One of my favorite lines is when Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias) goes about solving the general problem of mankind. In brief, he puts it this way: we don't need to declare war on any nation or anything more than 'the evils that beset' men. And this thing is the artificially expensive energy (sources like fossil fuels and oil) that is being used for the only sake of maintaining the economy. This way of thinking wasn't new in the eighties but nobody gave it a f**k, and now it is still vastly ignored on high levels but this is the very reason I am really glad they cared to give it some place in the movie. For the usual moviegoer a bullet in between Lee Iacocca's eyes wont say much but it was my secret warm spot :)<br/><br/>Apart from the deep thoughts there is what we can expect from a director like Snyder: beautifully choreographed fighting scenes every now and again. And not just in the third tier (as it's usually the case in this genre) but we're welcome with one great fight in the first few minutes. I felt ever so satisfied that there was only one character that could do harm by supernatural means, as the others had to perform some real exquisite stunts. This is what I call comic book on the screen, and Snyder proved that 300 wasn't just an accident. <br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the story, but the endgame is a real treat too, without any of the usual Hollywood cheesiness or ignorant spoon-fed moral. Something to think about and at the time of writing I have to admit it is even more. It's a magnetism that I feel very rarely: I simply must see it again in the movies, as I can't wait for the DVD release. Let's hope it'll be a major blockbuster and also a critically acclaimed piece and so we can hope for a long awaited beginning of the adulthood of comic book adaptations. Keep up the good work Zack Snyder!"

However, they did not see the big, huge letters on the screen pointing out it was from a graphic novel.<br/><br/>That is just my assessment, and opinion. I just hope folks heed it..to some degree.

","This movie was one of the most anticipated films of 2009, but unlike The Dark Knight it does not live up to its expectations. Watchmen stays way to loyal to the comics. One of the problems with The Dark Knight was because of its 2 and a half hour long movie, but Watchmen doesn't care about that problem because its 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Watchmen is crammed shut full of everything that was in the comics and is taken slow, but the ending is rushed and not similar to the comics. Now does this make sense? I can go on and on about how bad Watchmen was, but I don't feel like wasting more of my time on this awful movie. So long story short Watchmen isn't worth paying money to see and is barely worth watching for free. Don't go see Watchmen it is terrible."
"darkshadows1981","5","2","5","6 January 2019"," Could have been better
","This definitely was far from JDM's usual roles and he definitely bombed it in a bad way. Good thing his character doesn't last long otherwise I'd be cringing throughout the entire film instead of his terrible scenes.<br/><br/>This movie is basically a bunch of subplots thrown together to form a nearly three hour movie. You can't really figure out what the main story is. You just have to connect it all together. Honestly, this would have been much better as a trilogy or even a TV series. The subplots were all red herrings that took away from the main story of the world being on the brink of annihilation.<br/><br/>I don't particularly care for the political, social, and amoral tone of the movie either but I understand the purpose of using it. The action scenes were pretty cool and short-lived. The film has romance and what appeared to be unintended or possibly intended dry comedy.<br/><br/>Anyways the Watchmen have been around for a long time with their roles being passed on from one political era to another or from one social generation to another. I'll let you interpret that, but either way they are supposed to be humanity's keepers until one of the watchmen goes rogue (or not depending on how you see it). You should definitely understand American exceptionalism and compare the Watchmen as operating within the culture of a police state, hence the whole Who is watching the watchmen tag you'll see early on.<br/><br/>There is a lot of symbolism in the film so I definitely recommend watching it more than once but the more you watch it the more your view of the film's quality will decrease because the plot is masterfully represented in a symbolic way but the screenwriting is so bad that you don't catch the actual story unless you watch it more than once or is a fan of the comics and understand the actual story."
"tiodonfrancisco","3","2","5","1 November 2018"," A bad movie with good scenes
","It is difficult to say if it is a good or a bad movie, since it has so many good things as bad, but I think that bad things are much more powerful than good ones, Watchmen gives a poor reflection of the main theme of the comic which is what would happen with the superheroes in the real world, instead of showing it in an innovative way, they decide to copy exactly everything they do in the comic, and this does not only happen with the themes that they play, but also in the action and the script, they just copy what the original work did, what could be rescued from the film are the performances of jackie earle haley as rorschach and jeffrey dean morgan as the comedian, the performances of these two seem out of the comic, but not in the bad sense as with the script and action, if this were the only thing that could be said of the movie would be an acceptable film, but the big mistake that zack snyder made was to try to adapt ALL the comic in only one movie, and although this lasts two hours the original story is too complex, it would have taken about 3 films to adapt the plot well, but shortening it in only two and a half hours is like a lot of events that do not lead anywhere, anyway, if you see this movie without haberte I read the comic probably does not seem at all bad, but if you're a fan of the comic as I, probably notice these errors.<br/><br/>PD:This is my first review, if there is a spelling mistake it is because I am translating this from Spanish to English, because I am from Chile<br/><br/>PD2:this is just my opinion, not an absolute truth, thanks for giving you the time to read everything"

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","5","2","5","30 August 2015"," It's a unique film but it is equally confusing
","With the creation of superheroes and comic books, the imagination of various artists and writers has endless boundaries. Once Hollywood proved to people and fans that adapting such works to film was doable, more and more studios began to hop on the gravy train looking for the most profitable opportunities to franchise. Whether it was mainstream or indie related, more and more comic book properties are being adapted to film due to the sheer craze that is consuming the movie business. For the majority of these cases however, very few productions involved adapt a graphic novel by the page. When it comes to this group of loyal fans, Watchmen (2009) is probably one of the few fans will say played it by the book (literally). Fresh off the critical and financial success of the Dawn of the Dead (2004) remake and 300 (2006), director Zack Snyder took on his second comic book adaptation (the first being 300 (2006)) and it performed just as well as Snyder's other projects.<br/><br/>Lots of fans and critics were pleased with Snyder's visual direction and the writing handled by Alex Tse (his first theatrical credit) and David Hayter (X-Men (2000), The Scorpion King (2002) & X-Men 2 (2003)). There are a number of good parts but for the average viewer, this film is just as confusing as it is watchable. The setting is in an alternate universe in 1985 where Richard Nixon was voted president for a third term. All superheroes must remain hidden and the cold war between the US and the USSR has escalated to where a count down takes place for when everyone fires nukes at each other. It's definitely new because honestly where would the world be if Richard Nixon continued his presidency? The plot is a crime mystery about a superhero named The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed by unknown assailant. Upon discovering this, the angry ink-faced detective Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) makes his mission to find out what happened while talking with his partners Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) and Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson).<br/><br/>Now, if this were just a crime thriller or a superhero Vs government debacle or a cold war fight, then the story structure to this would be a lot easier to follow. Unfortunately Hayter and Tse's writing tries to infuse all these giant plots together and it becomes quite difficult to follow for a number of reasons. A big problem is a constant shift in focus. There is nothing wrong with having multiple main characters as long as they are properly developed, and they are in this film. The issue is, the way each character is developed is so detracting from one another, and it begins to get confusing on what the main point of the scene was all about. Another flaw is the unequal tone in its storytelling. Frequently the way at which scenes and characters are shown dramatically swap between serious and comedy in almost surrealist like viewing as if the audience is supposed to laugh. Was this supposed to be a partially black comedy? Some of the sick humor is clear while other times not. The continuity related to time feels all over the place as well.<br/><br/>There are certain main characters that have a picture taken in 1940 and at that point they look like they're in their 30s. Jump to the current period and some of them look no different while others aged. How is it that some aged and others not? This can throw off viewers because they can't tell if they're watching the current or past time. It's not even that frustrating that the film is 3 hours long. It's just that with all this run time, perhaps something would feel in order? There are some areas that pick up for these errors. A big plus is the acting by all actors. The actor who looked like he had the most fun and who many people enjoyed was Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. The trench coat, fedora, the Rorschach ink blot mask and the gruff angry voice is makes the character so memorable. All the costume designs are unique in their own way as well. The special effects to Rorschach's mask and Dr. Manhattan look great too. <br/><br/>The action is another important key note. For most mainstream comic book movies that belong to logos like DC or Marvel, most are kept PG-13 for the sake of wider audience distribution and better ticket sales. By 2009 Marvel had a number of R rated films in their library like the Punisher, Blade and Man-Thing features. As for DC, this would be their first R rated superhero film and it is gloriously graphic. Maybe not bucket loads of blood are dropped but some scenes can make the viewer wince at just the thought of what is displayed. The cinematography by Larry Fong is decently crafted. Being that he worked with Snyder on 300 (2006) only seems familial and his work is well integrated in with the CGI. Sadly the film score composed by Tyler Bates and the soundtrack was disappointing. For one, Bates does not have a main theme for the protagonists so that's a bit dumbfounding to start off with. Any other tracks in between aren't really developed and mostly overshadowed by all the soundtrack songs that include various 1980s artists. Again, the music adds to that strange offbeat tone that shows its face time and again. Is it supposed to be hilarious?<br/><br/>It has well designed special effects, gory action set pieces, effective acting and good-looking camera-work. However, its good doesn't make up for the bad. The film score is minimally empty, the soundtrack library of songs and part of its writing don't mix well and create an uneven tone in overall seriousness. There are timeline continuity errors and the focus alternates too much with an overabundance of main plot lines."
"Clockwork_Orange55","8","2","5","12 July 2015"," ""...the flawed masterpiece.""
","Director's Cut<br/><br/>If crime cinema has its own ""The Godfather"", then superhero/comics would have accomplished ""Watchmen"". ""Watchmen"" does not win a point on terms for cinematic quality as much, but the narrative depth that it offers is thoroughly similar. Alan Moore's Watchmen is a complex story, with complex characters, in troubled times. Set in the cold- war era, ""Watchmen"" undertakes a visual scope of the darkest universe, with whores and wronged politicians dwelling.<br/><br/>'Watchmen' is a group of costumed vigilantes, working for a sole purpose – to eradicate crimes completely and attempts to make the world a 'better place'. They are Rorschach (Jackie Earle Harley), Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup), Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) and Ozymandias (Matthew Goode). ""Watchmen"" is probably similar to the batman universe. The only contrast would mainly be that Watchmen's has six, but Batman has one.<br/><br/>Mostly during the course of the story, ""Watchmen"" shows retired superheroes (except Rorschach). Those being crime-fighters are merely a past. It is a national law called 'The Keene Act', which is being released during that point of time which made any form of vigilantism illegal.<br/><br/>The story begins with the murder of The Comedian. His comrade, Rorschach, was being made to be wary, and immediately warned other Watchmens that there might be a formidable enemy intending to annihilate the group. Rorschach understands that The Comedian is not an easy target, and he deems the murderer to be no less than 'extraordinary'. The story then moves forward with Rorschach, the only active vigilante, striving to unravel the mystery by disclosing the identity of the killer, and the reasons of it.<br/><br/>Even if it abruptly charges with a mystery, ""Watchmen"" never stays in that direction. The film continuously digs deeper- into the implications from the murder, and also into the characters. ""Watchmen"" shows competence in character development. For instance, Dr Manhattan is flawed morally, despite being the only person who is gifted with superpowers. He betrays his lover, lacking care for people and blindly obeys orders from the President to interfere the Vietnam War and mercilessly murder people. Perhaps amidst enduring the unparalleled abilities which none other will have, he loses touch with humanity.<br/><br/>Ozymandias is questionable. A villain, an anti-hero or actually a hero? He is responsible for the peace made between nations in the world, but consequently, millions are killed. Ozymandias setting up exploding energy reactors in major cities to eliminate conflicts completely, reminded me of the efforts made by the American to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to bring an end to Word War 2, and ultimately to carry peace to the world. If the world never condemns USA, then I don't see the need to put Ozymandias down. What he does, is actually similar to what American had done during the Second World War –kill millions, to save billions.<br/><br/>Roscharch is most loyal to a set of principles he clings on. A fixed devotee of vigilantism he is, although he is actually the least merciful of the six. The Comedian has his story to tell, Nite Owl is a naïve-nice guy preserver and Silk Spectre II, the only woman in the team, shows weaknesses and shares unwell ties with her comrades. ""Watchmen"" shows strength in showing that all the characters play pivotal parts to bring the story forward. None of the characters is wasted, and if one goes off, the adventure will never work.<br/><br/>I could imagine seeing ""Watchmen"" on a big screen and experience wonders.

","Watchmen (2009): Dir: Zack Snyder / Cast: Billy Crudup, Malin Akerman, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Jackie Earle Haley: Visual extravaganza comic book adaptation regarding watchers of evil. It regards a group of superheroes that are slowly dying off as someone wants them gone. Directed by Zack Snyder with a long yet detailed screenplay that concentrates on the relationships. What Snyder does is bring mortality to superheroes and renders them flawed, which works brilliantly. Billy Crudup plays the distractingly naked Dr. Manhattan who can heighten, multiply etc. He works for the U.S. Government and has genuine powers. Malin Akerman plays Laurie Jupiter who was once involved with him. Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl who joins forces with Jupiter to continue fighting crime. Jackie Earle Haley plays an intriguing character with a mask named Rorschach who is framed for a murder and tests the limits the prison with graphic results. His mask has shape shifting black and white patterns that take on an ominous appeal. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the Comedian who is deceased early but past revealed through flashbacks that pull his moral code in two directions. While it runs nearly three hours, the special effects are outstanding. Its examination of flawed superheroes is quite intriguing rendering it one of the best of superhero movies. Watchmen is worth watching. Score: 9 / 10"

","Watchmen is a film I believe has been given a hard time by a lot of mainstream American critics, while common viewers seem to be really divided, about the film's quality. But as far as I am concerned, this is an amazing film; not only personally, but also for objective reasons.<br/><br/>What most people can agree with is that the characters are magnificent, which I completely agree. Everybody in this film is simply magnificent; their complexities and views are amazing, and very engaging. Nevertheless I believe Malin Akerman's acting abilities are not the best, then again her character is the most bland in the graphic novel, so it is not entirely her fault.<br/><br/>The aesthetic look of the film is also amazing it looks very gritty and somewhat disgusting, but also stylish and colourful. A common complaint about the film, is that the imagery has no symbolic meaning. This complaint is pointless; the imagery is there to look good, while the story of the film, is what holds all the intellectual importance.<br/><br/>People also complain that the film, is not focused and that it is far too long. I will agree that there are times in the film, where it does feel a little unfocused, but not enough to distract you from the film. And the complaint that the film is ""too"" long, just makes the critics sound like little children. The movie is long, but it is never boring, because there is always something smart, important, or just cool being shown.<br/><br/>The story of the film is great, mainly because of the amazing way the characters portray the themes of morality, human nature, vigilante justice, etc.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a great film and people who dislike it, are most likely people with little interest in out-of-this-world aesthetic look, complex plots, and the exploration of themes through complex characters."
"dromasca","4","2","5","4 July 2012"," beautiful expensive nonsense
","I am no fan of the super-heroes films genre, and 'Watchmen' did not change this. The film tries to build a sophisticated intrigue which gives to several superheroes a past and some dilemmas to deal with (beyond saving the world) in a revisionist version of history where the Vietnam war was won by a super-heroes helped America and Nixon won four consecutive presidential mandates. Actually this alternate history landscape and the beautiful cinematography are the best parts in the film, which otherwise I found to be a pretentious and long nonsense.<br/><br/>Now my son points to me that איק graphic novel the film is based upon is one of the best and most known modern literature works of our age and is studied and read even in academical institutes. Maybe, but this still could not make me believe for one fraction of second the view of the latex-costumed heroes dealing with relationship traumas. The level of the cinematographic realization was also uneven. Splendid computerized effects (like when Dr. Manhattan finds himself on Mars) coexist with what looks like bad make-up of the main heroes. Was this intentional? Maybe, but I missed the intention.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, one more grouping of sequences I loved - the scenes with the plethora of generals in the situation room surrounding the old venerable president Nixon ready to decide on starting WWIII based on a 54% estimation that the whole Soviet Union will be nuclearly annihilated, while 'only' a few big cities on the US East Coast will be hit in the retaliation. This looked like an homage to 'Dr. Strangelove' and was superb. But not enough."
"tsrtrhs","6","2","5","25 February 2012"," Wasn't bad, but wasn't that great.
","As a fan of the graphic novel, I was very excited to find a cheap copy of this movie and see it for the first time. But, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. I didn't hate the film, but there were flaws that kept piling up. For instance, in the beginning, the script was pulled straight from the book, and while I appreciate the effort to stick to the source material, that was not the way to do it, as it made the dialogue forced and feel unnatural. The actors did a fine job, but places like that made me wince at the way they delivered lines. Another problem I had was the lack of character development. it felt like they tried to build up each character in about five seconds, with minor flashbacks and with silent scenes in the opening credits, whereas in the novel, much more effort and time was put into each individual. The last big problem I had was the music choice. There are times when a non-obvious choice for underscoring fit in the movie (The opening with Bob Dylan's ""The times, they are a-changing"" or near the climax, with Jimi Hendrix's ""All along the Watchtower""), But there were some points were the music didn't work at all, like when Jon (Dr. Manhattan) was in Vietnam, the choice of underscoring made it seem cheesy and cheap. I do have to say though, almost everything else was good. The costuming, the sets, the cinematography, however, when you miss on two of the big ones (writing and score) you're missing to much in my opinion. All in all, I'm glad I watched it, and if you're into darker, grittier super heroes that are a bit more twisted, I recommend you see it, however, I do believe it's been over-rated."

","After having seen this movie, I am left puzzled, speechless, lost in thoughts, left with many questions about the characters.<br/><br/>I have not read the comic series; in fact I was not even aware that this movie was derived from a comic series, and due to the somewhat ""strange"" movie poster, I prepared myself to watch another Hollywood flick about heroes, with cheesy lines, half-hearted acting, horrible storyline, men with a fetish for costumes and pseudo-identities, etc.<br/><br/>I was surprised in many ways. 1st, that Hollywood was actually capable of delivering something so thought provoking, so deep as I could have only expected it from books. I personally have only read very few books in my life, as I do not have the patience, loose concentration and interest very fast. Hence, as I am sure my previous comment labels me for my generation, I consider movies my ""book collection."" <br/><br/>Having read several reviews of this movie now, it is hard for me to establish credit either to the comic series write Andy Moor or the director of the movie Zack Snyder. In my opinion Andy Moor deserves great respect for packaging a bizarre presentation of reality, in the form of men in costumes, labeled as heroes, in order to deliver a message, making it more appealing for the masses. On the other hand, I am very happy that there are directors out there with such a keen eye for detail, understand the message, transforming it in another form. Zack Snyder in my opinion is just as gifted as Andy Moor."
"kevin-miller447","10","2","5","5 August 2011"," A visual masterpiece
","Every one in Hollywood considered the graphic novel Watchmen unfilmable. Zach Snyder who is well known for his visually impressive film 300 too the novel and made an impressive adaptation that far exceeded my expectations. Before seeing this movie, I had not read the graphic novel. After viewing, I bought it and compared. I was surprised at how thorough he had been. Watchmen is visually immersive, story and character driven with an amazing amount of SFX and VFX. The cast all around is fantabulous and no one does poorly. This movie also got the careers of a few actors going which doesn't surprise me. For anyone who is hesitant at watching this epic movie, just go in for Rorschach because man oh man is Jackie Earl Haley a great actor. He was my favorite character and I loved the way he moved and talked. The movie is set in an alternate world where certain things differ from ours and the city looks very dark and gritty. This is a very long film, however, it is required in order to do justice to the lengthy novel and all the characters inhabiting this world. The story is complex to the extent that you'll need to watch it a few times but that isn't a bad thing because it is a fun movie to watch in general.Snyder also uses plenty of slow motion in order to enhance the breath taking action and fighting scenes which are choreographed brilliantly. I really have no negatives for this movie because every time I watch it I get sucked into this fictionalized world and really invest in these very flawed but awesome characters."

The saw/jail scene was maybe the best one, and The Comedian is just awesome! at the end I was feeling like one of those teens that can't find another word and repeat AWESOME so many ways it lost any sense.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was great, even with the boring girl who played Silk Specter II (who did a great job) and lame kid who played Nite Owl II(who actually did great).<br/><br/>Now, about the second Nite Owl, the problem is not the actor but a previous role he played, Hard Candy ruined the poor dude, just like Sleepers ruined Kevin Bacon forever more.<br/><br/>I haven't thought once that they ruined one of the best comics ever, as I screamed they have when I first heard a movie was on the making I was prejudiced against this for so long, and now lets just remember that saying ""keep your words soft and sweet in case you have to eat them"" I give it a 9/10"
"Pinky_Powers","9","2","5","31 December 2010"," Could not have been done better.
","When I read that Zack Snyder was to take on Watchmen I rolled my eyes. I mean, sure, he did a great job with 300, but that book lent itself to film like a cheap hooker to a wealthy jon; it was cinematic before cinema even touched it.<br/><br/>The Watchmen graphic novel is not cinematic. Even though it is composed of images that could be shot with a camera, it's slow and deliberate and rebels against any notion of shortening or getting to the point with pith. Alan Moore would hate you for even asking... and so does his book. While modern editors would call this a weakness to any story, those of us who've read Watchmen know it is an honest strength.<br/><br/>So how could a beast like that be adapted to film and call itself a Comicbook Movie, and sit beside others like Iron Man and X-Men and Fantastic Bore... And how could Mr. Snyder's experience on 300 and Dawn of the Dead possibly prepare him for something like this? Well, how could Peter Jackson come off Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners and make Lord of the Rings, my all-time favorite book and film (they're all one, don't ya know ;^)). It's just not possible! But it happened.<br/><br/>And it happened here, too. Zack Snyder rose above merely making excellent films and made something that shouldn't have been possible. Watchmen is slow and deliberate and utterly dripping with potency. It retains the pacing, style and quality of the Alan Moore book, and does it all in 162 minutes.<br/><br/>Henceforward this weird creep shall sit high and proud on my short list of favorite directors whose movies I'll always see opening week. May he live there forever along with Peter Jackson, the Scott brothers and James Cameron."
"kimi_layercake","9","2","5","1 August 2010"," Most Unconventional Superheroes Movie Ever Made
","First of all, I didn't have the faintest idea about the comic series calling it ""Watchmen"". All I heard about the movie prior to release was that it was not a conventional superhero movie and this movie has been initiated several times in the past until someone felt it was ""unfilmable"". Now, that really aroused my interest in the movie.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder, the visionary director took the reins and deliver a movie experience never seen before.Yes, it was a very complicated movie, with lots of side stories and too many characters, none of whom demanding less attention. But Zack Snyder does it all. The costumes, set design, art direction are just flawless. The end result is a movie so unique, so visually stunning, so exhilarating, so brilliantly edited that one will always cherish this experience.<br/><br/>Castwise, just perfect. Relatively little known faces, but what a job each of them delivers. I guess the cast was a masterstroke handled superbly by Zack Snyder. The characters of Rorschach, Comedian, Nite Owl, Dr.Manhattan, and Silk Spectre are so exciting and so well depicted by their protagonist, it's just impossible to find flaw in the whole cast.<br/><br/>Lengthwise, the movie does stretches itself beyond 2 and 1/2 hours, but that's admissible considering the ""unfilmable"" materials. I recommend this movie to everyone, even those who are not aware of the source materials. This movie is possible the most unconventional, most difficult superheroes movies ever made.<br/><br/>My Verdict: 9/10"

","I'll start by saying that I didn't read the comics. I understand that those familiar with the comics find the movie a lot better, and I can appreciate a movie that works for fans. I don't think it works well for creating new fans.<br/><br/>I don't remember the last time I saw such a bunch of bland heroes. The movie didn't make me care for any of them, and the only one who was interesting (or at least fun to watch) was Rorschach. Live, die, save the world, destroy the world, I just didn't care.<br/><br/>The movie started slowly, and dragged for about an hour, until I almost wanted to stop watching. It did pick up once Rorschach got arrested, and the plot started moving towards a conclusion. Even then, the conclusion didn't have much of an emotional impact.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a 6 because the Rorschach part and action sequences are decent, but in my opinion that's not a good enough reason to watch this otherwise uninteresting movie."
"beatnick49","10","2","5","14 May 2010"," Snyder's best so far
","The superhero/superhuman has often been scrutinised, parodied, or brought down to earth within the world of the comic book or movie screen. The Incredibles looked at how superheroes would cope if forced into civilian life. The Civil War posed the question of whether superheroes are subject to the law or, by virtue of the work they do, immune from it. The Civil War also looked at how superheroes and superhumans would react to the question. Kick Ass, showed what would happen if real people decided to become masked vigilantes. Watchmen, even though based on a graphic novel written before either The Incredibles or Civil War, takes the scrutiny and parody in a different direction.<br/><br/>In what is Snyder's best movie to date, the superhumans are ""super"", their abilities beyond other humans. However, their ""hero"" status is dependent on the public's perception of them. Masked vigilantes, with abilities, are popular when they first emerge in the pre-war America (1920s-1930s); they can pose with the police, they smile for the camera, they are depicted on war planes and can act gay in public in early post war America, and are also happily received if they reveal their secret identity. Their ""hero"" status is only sustained because of positive public opinion. The Comedian a sadistic, racist, womanizing, rapist, who shoots his pregnant girlfriend (all unknown to the public) is a hero because he fights for his country. Whether people know or even care about his tendency to delight in burning Vietnamese alive is another matter. Ozymandius, is popular because he has given up heroics, and is the Bono of the movie. Roarscharch is hunted and regarded as a criminal because he is a masked vigilante, even though he gives low lifes the what for.<br/><br/>This movie, also questions, just what is the hero. The person who saves people, the person who protects, the person who punishes? The Comedian protects his country, but has no altruism about him. Roarsharch still has childhood issues, and still holds a grudge to women, even though he is incensed at the murder of a girl, but inflicts punishment on crims and we may say, good, the guy deserves it. Ozymandius decides to protect people, by killing people, sacrificing lives to preserve life, and honestly believes he is doing the right thing.<br/><br/>In the 1970s they become unpopular, possibly seen as thugs without oversight. In the 1980s, any superhuman who acts outside the law is regarded by the public and listed under the law, as a criminal. This deconstrunctionist approach to the super hero mythos is one of the strengths of the movie. The characters are just so interesting to watch. Even if they're unsympathetic, this makes the ""heroes"" a joy to engage with, and a help make the 2 1/2 hour length more than worth it.<br/><br/>The other joy in this movie, is seeing ratbags suffer. There is a certain joy in seeing muggers, child killers, and prisoners, mutilated or dying in gruesome. I actually laughed Roarshach gave the child killer what for, tossed cooking oil on the inmate, shove the guy in the tilet, and when the priosner got his arms sawed.I reckon inside a lot of us, there is a desire to see people like that, to get it, and get it good.<br/><br/>Another good thing about the movie, is Silk Spectre II. Snyder had strong women in his last films, and he keeps up the trend in this one.<br/><br/>Another point of this film I like is the twist it puts on the portrayal of communist and American leaders. Breshnev is not the fat, balding stibble faced gorilla, and Castro is not pudgy, with a bushy beard chomping on a fat cigar. They are tall, well built, serious, and know what they're doing, Nixon and Kissinger by contrast are fat, bloated, balding, slugs.<br/><br/>The other strength in this film is it's solid story, even though may predict the twist, it's well told, and has momentum and keeps it going, it balances action, character development, story, and background, and it has few if any loopholes. It also looks at the inherent violence, and self destruction of humans.<br/><br/>This whole movie, is just all round engaging. I was never bored when I watched it a year ago. Interested all the way. Only looking away to make comments about it, to my friends.<br/><br/>Snyder has made great films in his career; Dawn Of The Dead, 300, and now this; his best one yet. I'm looking forward to Suckerpunch.<br/><br/>Thnak you Snyder, for Watchmen."

","""Watchmen"" could be the best superhero movie has ever adapted from comic books, even thiz could be better than ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). The Director is Zack Snyder, the man behind the extraordinary visual movie ""300"" (2006). He also directed the simple but effective horror ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 2004. Snyder is a young Director whose his track record never flaw until now. The cinematography in thiz film is still stunning, every scene made with great details. The Watchmen's original material comes from a graphic comic which is written by Alan Moore. Every character in Watchmen is very unique. The most unique character maybe is Dr. Manhattan who is played by Billy Crudup. The other Cast members are Malin Akerman, Jackie Earle Haley, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Goode, Carla Gugino and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. ""Watchmen"" tells a story about how a group of superheroes deals with the society on alternate world in 1985. One side, they are needed to maintain peace. But on the other side, they are shunned because of their oddity .The Soundtracks support very well to give a precise atmosphere during thiz movie. The conflicts are in order and proportional. In my opinion, Malin Akerman's physical appearance as Silk Spectre II is the best presentation of superhero character so far. The posture and shape how superhero should looks like is appeared perfectly. The climax of thiz movie is also very fair, where we could be blurred for defining who are the bad guys or good guys.

","Watchmen 2009 is set in an alternate 1985 America in which costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, & the ""Doomsday Clock"" - which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union - is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. Based on Alan Moore's cult graphic novel, Watchmen is an action-adventure mystery set in the mid-1980s, in a mythical USA, where a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union looms large. Government-controlled, costumed vigilantes are an accepted segment of society, but independent crime fighters are no longer allowed to work their magic. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill & discredit all past & present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging & disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past & catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity- but who is watching the Watchmen?"" There have been so many big budget blockbuster films in 2009 that Watchmen kind of passed by the way side. I went into the film not expecting anything great but I found it an excellent entertaining comic book film. It is a good as several of the Batman movies. Snyder approached the material with enough reverence that fans of the comic will appreciate the film. Superheroes: cannot live ordinary lives but are fated to help mankind. Watchmen took comic books to the next level as almost literature. The R-rated, nearly-three-hour movie packs a lot of punch exciting scenes visuals & sounds. The film is really intense & leaves a memory with you long after you have seen it. The film is not the story of the triumphant reunion of a band of superheroes but of its blow up & self-destruction. Not all the Watchmen survive the film, & the world may have reason to be grateful for that. The film was made after a publicized rights dispute between Fox and Warner Bros. Rather than a comic book masterpiece it is really a dramatic compression of the Hugo Award winning novel. Fans of Alan Moore's landmark sci fi novel will love every pulpy line of dialogue and bloody act of retribution kept in director Zack Snyder's faithful and film-wise lavish adaptation. But most of us who are unfamiliar with Moore's bleak subversive comic book fiction may get lost due to multiple flashbacks. Its still a good and exciting comic book film 3 or 4 stars."

","It's interesting how I got to finally watch this movie. When I saw the posters for the movie, the six main characters didn't appeal to me for some reason. I just thought ""this is another superhero movie"". Man, was I wrong. So, fast-forwarding to the last month, I decided to check it out online. The stream was so slow I barely saw around the first third of the film. I was so enticed by it I decided to buy the DVD without watching the whole thing first; not an usual thing I do, I only buy DVDs of movies I saw and liked. I wasn't disappointed. It turned out to be quite a nice surprise.<br/><br/>Some people go as far as comparing this film to The Dark Knight. I can certainly see the ""cynicism"" and the dark overtones of both films. Both films also depict superheroes (except Dr. Manhattan) as fairly normal human beings (well, with physical prowess of top athletes though; some think like supercomputers). They are both philosophical and crude. However, The Dark Knight somewhat sticks to the good-bad formula (Batman never becomes corrupted, for instance). Watchmen goes way further into depicting heroes as more complex and morally ambiguous, like... human beings! Amazing, the first time comic characters come as close as real people.<br/><br/>The story is also very interesting, full of layers of background history and symbolism. It has many twists and it depicts many bad choices made by the characters (they are no longer perfect). Hell, they even depict one moment of sexual frigidity! That was hilarious, and it is yet one example of how this movie rocks. It becomes a statement in itself: a human, realistic statement. Rorschach is by far the most interesting character for me; an underdog who undergoes several life changes, and becomes a ""no-bullshit, all-go"" detective type of person who, in his own words ""never compromises, not even in the face of armaggedon"". His practical approach is the best, and so is his amoral ways.<br/><br/>Well, I've got nothing else to say that hasn't been said a thousand times before. All characters have a role and a personality (well, they could have developed Silk Spectre II more, she's kind of generic), and it mimics real history with flawed characters. A giant step in Hollywood films! 10 out of 10, without doubt."

It is very close to the novel but obviously a more cinematic and exciting experience than the novel (but still a good adaption). Amazing, amazing film."

","OK, first things first if you want to watch a good superhero movie, this will do, it's not as good as either of the recent Batman films, but it is better aesthetically than a lot of its contemporaries.<br/><br/>As a major critique though, it starts off very well and just feels quite rushed and a little ham-fisted towards the end, the action seems overdone and a little glib and the dialogue scant, kind of rushed.<br/><br/>BUT - please bear in mind I do consider this to be better than a lot of things that are out there currently/recently.<br/><br/>Now as for a critique/comparison to the graphic novel/comic... Fffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu - youtube the extended Black Freighter segment and you get a comment by one of the guys in the creative team who says something along the lines of ""I didn't get it the first time I watched it, but on second viewing..."" - dude, why are you even involved in this? You didn't get it? ""...many layers"" - I'm doing my incredulous face - yes Hollywood is that stupid, no we can't watch a 3 hour film, should've clocked in at about 4, yet I guess cinemas are too cash-hungry to allow an intermission.<br/><br/>Realistically, it's rushed, even losing the Black Freighter, which many would consider integral to the story as a (very good framing device) - the film still needed to be an hour longer, so much characterisation was missed out, so much undeveloped, unexplained... instead of getting a potential Citizen Kane, we get a quite good development/extension of the Suoerman ideology, like the 1st movie where it's all nice and then in the following they try to develop character, it's a weird mish-mash of the two, yet terribly one-dimensional. Unlike Sin City where Rodriguez decided ""screw this"" I'm truly treating the source material with respect, this (sadly) is just a bastardisation of the original material, that ultimately is sadly and sorely lacking.<br/><br/>A disheartening experience, especially as I considered Zak Snyder to be a decent up and coming director - who I thought would treat his material with more respect."
"Gunn","9","2","5","9 August 2009"," True to its source!
","I saw the graphic novel/comic book version of this story first. I enjoyed it as I do most all film noir movies. I wondered how can they possibly transfer this to a live action film, especially Rorschach's mask. Wow, did Zack Snyder and crew deliver! This was a stunning, engrossing film. Page by page there was every scene from the book. The casting was perfection with Billy Crudup (Dr. Manhattan) and Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach) leading the pack. Jeffrey Dean Morgan as (The Comedian), Carla Gugino and Malin Akerman (Silk Spectre I & 2), Stephen McHattie and Patrick Wilson (Night Owl I & II) and Matt Frewer (Moloch) and the rest looked like they just jumped off the pages of the comic book. The special effects were terrific as were the cinematography, music score, art design, sound effects. The acting was very impressive as was the script. Snyder kept things moving along nicely and that made a lengthy film seem go by quickly. I don't know how this will sit with those unfamiliar with the novel or comic book, but if they take the time to check out the book, they will enjoy the film."

","There were so many things to get upset about it this film I almost became bored of hearing myself express them.<br/><br/>Almost.<br/><br/>From lovable, misunderstood rapist ""The Comedian"" and the defence of him somewhere along the lines of ""Yeah, but all humans are animals"", to the unnecessary use of a small girl being kidnapped and thrown to dogs (this is a comic book film, hardly the time for that sort of brevity) I only laughed once during the film and that was during the hilarious sex scene (which whilst being totally inappropriately porny also kind of reminded me of how it feels to walk in on your ageing parents shagging) To make sure that this was definitely the worst sex scene of any movie, ever, they used the beautiful track ""Hallelujah"" which is something akin to if they they played ""always look on the bright side of life"" at Diana's funeral. Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.<br/><br/>On the plus side, its also depressingly long, so you have enough time to fully appreciate quite how crap a film this is."

","A great all star cast is just the beginning of Watchmen, quite possibly the greatest superhero film ever made. The film starts out with a superhero being thrown through a plate-glass window by a mysterious man. Later, we figure out that man being thrown through the plate-glass window is the old version of The Comedian. Now, there is a new Comedian, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. He is not in very big touch with his superhero pals. The world is having a lot of trouble. People are dying left and right, and Richard Nixon is still president. The movie has a lot of visually stunning moments, and you can't help but to like all the characters here. They are superheroes in their own way. They do not have any desire to prove that they are efficient superheroes. You admire them for that. I was dying to see this film since I heard about it about a year before it opened. The film not only exceeded expectations, it was more amazing than I thought it would be, and I thought is was gonna be a pretty damn amazing film. The three hour film length is actually good because nothing needs to get cut out, everything is too good. Also, the soundtrack choice is perfect, playing songs in the background you would not expect to be played in the background, but they play perfectly with the movie. Definitely check this amazing film out...it's great."

","When I saw this I hadn't read the graphic novel and was expecting a good superhero movie. Ya know like the Dark Knight, or Iron Man. But I was surprised to find that it more than just a good superhero movie, in fact it transcended the superhero genre! It revealed the darker side of the superheroes, it showed us why they were invented, they were right-wing, pro-American propaganda figures. We kinda reflect on that with brutal superheroes (more like superanti-heroes!) like ever vigilant Rorschach and the nihilistic Comedian. That scene where The Comedian burns the one-legged Viet Cong soldier alive, shocked the hell out of me! Along with the expose on superheroes, these are some of the other pros of this movie. The visual effects were amazing! I couldn't believe it them! The soundtrack was great! Simon and Garfunkel, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, all awesome! It goes for 3 hours and it doesn't get boring. I needed to urinate for half of the movie, but I didn't wanna leave the theatre it was so entertaining. The acting wasn't really what I'd call Oscar worthy (in fact those top-knot thugs were terrible actors) but most of it wasn't bad. The film style was awesome. I nearly cried a few times throughout the movie, like the first scene with the superhero days rising and falling to the tune of ""The Time are Changing"" and the scene in which Hollis has the flashbacks I loved it. It was one hell of thought provoker, especially with the ending where you can't tell who's good or bad.<br/><br/>Now I'll leave the rest to you thank you for reading I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did."

There is blood, but I don't mind that. The action is well done, the story telling was good, and the cinematography was really well done I thought. The running commentary with Rorshach's journal was very well done. Of course, one of the greatest twist's in all of comicdom was done well. <br/><br/>Personally, I don't think it's Shawshank Redemption, LOTR: The Two Towers, or Patton.

","I couldn't be more pleased with the film adaptation of Watchmen. I was blown away when I looked at the graphic novel again and saw that exact frames from the book were put on the screen. I also think that it was one of few movies where all the actors were perfect for their roles. All of them seemed to understand the part and do a wonderful job. I would especially like to commend Jackie Earle Haley on his performance as Rorschach. I hope Watchmen goes to the Oscars not only for the incredible acting, but the amazing visual ride that you go on. Such detail went into the sets and costumes. Watchmen really deserves to be recognized by the Academy. In my opinion, it's Zach Snyder's best film."
"gina-baker71","8","2","5","17 July 2009"," Topical
","Nearly three hours and careful plotting. This is not th average standard of summer action film. Zack Snyder has clearly made very exacting demands to make this film meet his expectations having to deal with Alan Moore's dismissive of previous attempts to film Moore's graphic novels.<br/><br/>Taking the graphic novel's story of an alternative history with Richard Nixon being repeatedly reelected and using this alternative world for a cynical commentary on the media and society, Watchmen are vigilantes who the government are threatening to outlaw. Instead of chases and explosions this intelligent adult film used character development and dialogue to drive the plot.<br/><br/>The cinematography is outstanding and makes this film even more enjoyable."
"Christian-Loescher","9","2","5","17 July 2009"," A New Kind of Superhero Movie
","I must admit, I really wasn't expecting this. I had anticipated seeing yet another ""superhero movie"" and being visually entertained for a couple hours, but this adaptation of the allegedly legendary graphic novel Watchmen far exceeded my initial expectations. David Hayter, who last wrote the first two X-Men movies, really outdid himself in writing this epic 160-minute film.<br/><br/>Set in the 1980s, Watchmen focuses on a handful of superheroes whose servitude to the world neither seems wanted nor necessary, with the exception of the enigmatic and omnipotent Dr. Manhattan. When one of the Watchmen is murdered at the beginning of the movie, it sets the stage for a jam-packed tale centered around questions of revenge and the human condition. Unlike other superhero movies I've seen in the past, not only do you have dazzling special effects and a multitude of action sequences, but the accompaniment of blood, gore, nudity, sex, and swearing. This, coupled with the dark imagery pervading the film, does a fantastic job of making the movie an adult feature, rather than a just torrent of guys and girls in tights kicking each others' butts. Heavily emotive and extremely interesting flashbacks show the history behind the characters if you, like me, am not aware of the details behind the graphic novel (which I believe gave me a distinct advantage).<br/><br/>The plot gives the feeling of a true crime type of movie, which further allows one to view the story as more of a tragedy than a simple action movie. The acting is particularly well done, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Jackie Earle Haley as one of the main characters (his last performance that I saw in Little Children made this role even more unexpected). The aforementioned special effects, though fantastic, don't overshadow the movie itself, and the mysterious orchestral score adds suspense and trepidation. To further the impression of a dark drama set in the past, the score is peppered with songs from Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Jimi Hendrix, and others. Though the movie was nearly three hours long, I was never bored and yet was consciously aware of its length.<br/><br/>All in all, I hope (and believe) that Watchmen will open the door for more mature and adult-themed superhero films with R ratings, and being the first one of its kind, does a darn good job of setting the bar for those of its kind yet to come. If you're looking for superhero action mixed with Dark Knight-styled imagery and lots of extras, you simply can't get any better than this."

It's really a waste of such a good crew of actors and graphics.<br/><br/>I was really disappointed.<br/><br/>Summary: there are a number of superhero's (which btw rape each-other) and they split up. Later, one of them has an plan to save the world. He does this by blowing up several cities and blaming it on another superhero, a blue nekkid guy who sees and knows everything, but still feels attracted to young girls. Than, when all these cities are blew up, the US and Russia have a common enemy (blue-nekkid-man) and stop fighting each-other. End of story. Isn't that super-crappy?"

All this functions as the back drop to the investigation which eventually draws some of the team back together. The film excels with dealing with moral grey areas and the decay of society in general.Overall the watchmen is about sacrifice and the greater good, can their be a greater good if the smaller goods get trampled on? Do the ends justify the means? This film intelligently asks the questions and invites the audience to form their own opinion rather than force some cheesy moral down their throat"

","For starters, let me just say that i am a big fan of movies based on comics/books as they provide insight and action to the pictures/words and aid one's imagination.<br/><br/>When I went to see watchmen it was so hyped up before hand that it would have had to be stunning to merit a good review and for me, it wasn't stunning.<br/><br/>I like the way that the dark, complex characters were portrayed, but this was quickly contradicted by the startling almost comic moments (such as Dr Manhattan's unnecessarily large blue genitalia.) As far as superheroes go, they weren't all that well portrayed individually. It seemed that they all had the same, boring power - super strength, with the obvious exception of the antagonist and Dr Manhattan.<br/><br/>I usually enjoy subtle movies, but this movie was so subtle, you would have to watch it about 3 or 4 times to understand every small, intricate detail that occurred, and the plot was far too complex to last for the somewhat enormous length of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all i would definitely say this is worth a watch, but it could have been so much better and achieved so much more."

I am enjoying this ride"" After the second hour I was thinking ""Hey! When did this turn into the Fantastic Four 3?"" (Not a good thing by the way).<br/><br/>After the third hour I was thinking ""Wasn't this only meant to be 2.5 hours long?

I'm not locked in here with you - you're locked in here with me."") is utterly menacing. The breakout scene is dazzling. The visual effects are stunning, especially Dr. Manhattan's Fortress of Solitude (sorry, the comparison is irresistible) on Mars. Flashbacks tell the back story effectively. And then it fizzles like a balloon with a slow leak. They can generate tachyons which can travel backward in time. So why can't Dr. Manhattan time travel and prevent the catastrophe? And so the world thinks it was attacked by Dr. Manhattan and puts away all its differences and everybody joins hands and sings ""We are the world."" Uh-huh. For a couple of months max, then what? What I was really hoping was Dr. Manhattan would travel back to 1972 and switch over to our own time line. And please spare me the argument that the ending is faithful to the graphic novel.

","I loved this movie. I have read the graphic novel (several times), and, as is the case for any film adaptation of a story originally presented with another medium, some changes had to be made. The film-makers did a really good job in picking out the important stuff and keeping true to the feel of the comic. It's a fairly dark story and has some moral ambiguities that neither the comic nor the film attempt to resolve... which is great. It's a story about people who happen to be ""costumed adventurers,"" i.e., well-trained normal humans who fight crime in costumes. Something happens, a mystery is presented, they try to solve it, and along the way, we see where they came from and how they evolve as people. I've heard a bunch of criticisms, but in all honesty, I have no idea what these people were expecting when they bought their tickets. If, by the vague description above, you think you'll like the movie, I recommend it highly. Below are some comments that contain spoilers. <br/><br/>SPOILERS to follow: <br/><br/><ul><li>Two big comments I heard was that Dr. Manhattan's exposed penis was distracting and that the sex scene between Dan and Laurie was awkward. Neither is true. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some thought that the fighting skills of the heroes were inaccurate. Sure, OK. But, they weren't that over the top, and just about every single movie ever made with a fight scene presents that scene implausibly. Get over it. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Malin Ackerman's acting. I've never been a great judge of acting, other than extremes. I thought she was fine (yes, she could have been better, but so could everyone). Also, and I'm sorry to say this so bluntly, but she's really hot. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There were plenty of things left out, like the pirate comic, many back story scenes, and many present-day scenes.

","Fanboys beware... You won't like this review... OK, so here's what happened, I've been a comic book fan for a long time, but I never got my hands on 'Watchmen' I did know how important it was, I did know who Alan Moore was and I did know some college professors even made a textbook out of this graphic novel but I never got a chance to read it.<br/><br/>So I went to see it knowing what I knew and couldn't got out of the theater more happy, confused and depressed... I know, weird.<br/><br/>Just like the graphic novel set out to do, the movie took everything I knew about superheroes and threw it out the window, with heroes breaking bones, killing, raping, maiming, etc. and not just criminals!<br/><br/>The human side of it all, so to speak. Then I came back home, thought about it and finally got my hands on the graphic novel and then I watched the movie again and wow... they really made a home run with that movie... the adaptation was incredibly loyal and the ending was better! (I felt the squid in the graphic novel was anti-climatic and didn't made sense for Dr. Manhattan to leave earth, fanboys, begin to bash...) Truth be told I hated 300, but Zack Snyder really got it right with this one, the acting, the photography, the costumes, all of it! <br/><br/>I was more intrigued by the Nite Owl character than any other (even Rorschach) and loved the costume! how come it took a non-batman movie to finally make a decent-cool looking-realistic Batman costume!? the hood came off easily (just like batman's comic book suit does) non of that magic marker around the eyes, it didn't looked like his agility was compromised by the suit and it looked sweeter than any costume in any batman movie ever! (fanboys, continue bashing...) So all in all this is a good movie, if you didn't read the graphic novel you may have to watch this movie two or three times, the second time around you will enjoy it more since you know what it is about and the 3rd time you will notice things you didn't notice before (very few movies do that) Also so few comic book movies deserve an Oscar for best adaptation...<br/><br/>Watchmen is a theatrical experience that if it's not recognized it will regain immediate cult status, either way this movie will remain deep in the hearts of this and many generations to come.<br/><br/>$0.02"
"farleyflavors10","10","2","5","23 March 2009"," I'll Watch The Watchmen, Over, and Over Again
","I have to salute Warner Brothers for taking to obvious gamble on producing a film which was not a guaranteed sell for mass audiences. They choose to stick as close to it's source as possible without compromising the integrity of said source. Doubly so I have to salute Zack Snyder for bravely throwing himself into a no win situation in taking on this project. He knew that he was damned by the purists of the graphic novel in lieu of the fact that he strove to stay as close as possible to Alan Moore's masterpiece. He also knew that he would also be damned by the uninitiated. The people who have never read the graphic novel. For the popcorn munching, soda-gulping crowd who were expecting another Dark Knight, and instead found a film which is abundant in psychological complexity, and jam packed with political satire. Watchmen was always meant to be a story where action takes a back seat to character depth.<br/><br/>In this age of cinema, we all seem to be plagued by the belief that things can't be done. We find ourselves to be discouraged to take risks, and attempt to think beyond to sphere of the current social consciousness. In the case of Watchmen, everyone concerned with the making of this film decided that this kind of cynicism is damaging. Warner Brothers decided that instead of joining the line of studios that rejected the project for fear of whatever backlash may occur, WB instead decided to be the one's to say ""We did it, and whether you like it, or not, what matters is that we had the guts to say it could be done.<br/><br/>After reading Watchmen I knew deep down that a film was possible, and that all it needed was a Director who had the right sensibility, and comprehension of the material to make it work. Zack Snyder, though not the obvious choice, was definitely a great choice. Some may call him a director who is all flash, and no substance, but after watching his prior work on Dawn of the Dead, and 300 I just can't agree with those claims. Snyder simply knows how to make the most of every scene by capturing it at every angle. He knew that the way to make any film memorable was to insure that every frame is an iconic image that'll be burned into the subconscious of the viewer. With Watchmen he struck a gold mine. Every frame of Watchmen is gorgeous to behold. He brings out the grimy streets of 1980's New York with unflinching passion. When Dr. Manhattan exiles himself on Mars, Snyder makes you feel the blissful solitude. Having read the book, I was able to see the same story from new and exciting aspects. I loved seeing familiar scenes achieve a kind of emotional impact that cannot be achieved with 2D images alone.<br/><br/>I do agree with Alan Moore that the graphic novel format is a medium all it's own, but I also agree with Robert Rodriguez (re: Sin City) when he said the mediums are similar. In the realm of movies, comics are storyboards, and Snyder, like Rodriguez, followed the imagery every step of the way. All the while knowing how to pace the story in all the right ways. <br/><br/>The differences in the adaptation are seldom but they are still appropriate. Never once was something cut or changed that I was left lamenting it's omission. I'm sure a lot of it will be in the promised director's cut. As for the squid. I'm sorry but even if Zack Snyder, and the screenwriters could find a way to fit it in, it seriously would have been a hard pill to swallow on film. Even with Snyder visual talents, it still would have looked ridiculous, and would have overshadowed the impact of Ozymandias' intent. The ending is different, but still the same. You still feel for the tragedy of what Ozymandias has done, but you still feel the conflict that all the Watchmen feel regarding their decisions afterward.<br/><br/>The only shortcomings I could say this film had was that Malin Akerman was lackluster, and seemed unable to reach the core of the part. Also the inclusion of Ozymandias' pet Bubastis is great for fans, but is quite confusing for the uninitiated, so it may mean a lashing from the fans, but since there's no prior scene explaining Bubastis' origins, as a fan I'd feel no remorse for losing the cat. I just hope that the director's cut explains her more thoroughly. <br/><br/>In the end I will boldly say that Watchmen is a masterpiece of ambitious film-making, and in the long run people will look back and realize what all the hubbub is about."
"Vic_max","Null","2","5","22 March 2009"," See it in IMAX...
","I never heard of the ""Watchmen"" before seeing the movie trailer. In fact, after seeing it, I thought that this would be like more like the Fantastic 4 (which wasn't one of my favorite movies) than Dark Knight.<br/><br/>However, the critics and user ratings are right - this is an amazing movie - if you see it in IMAX. This is how I saw it. I seem to have had a very different experience than many of my friends who saw it on normal sized screens. The IMAX rendition is so striking (both visually and audibly) that any problems in storytelling are shunted into the background. As such, I strongly recommend making the effort to see it on the huge screen if you have that option.<br/><br/>That said, it was well-acted, visually stunning and the pop-art references are fantastic. It is 2hours and 40 minutes long - and, in huge screen mode, just about every darn minute there was something amazing to look at.<br/><br/>It's basically a mystery story about the death of superhero ... in 1985. Although in this version of 1985, the existence of superheros is a part of life (even though there are only a handful).<br/><br/>Whatever you 'think' a superhero or comic-book movie can be like, this movie will challenge that (like Sin City did). It's not a kid's movie by any means. There is intense and graphic violence, explicit nudity and adult themes throughout. My advice is a big thumbs up if you've got an IMAX theater showing it. Since the critics and user ratings for this movie are both in positive territory, I say that indicates it's good flick no matter the screen size."

","I've never read the Watchmen comics, so I don't know how the movie compares... but the movie was excellent. It's 1985, Nixon is still president, prostitution is legal, and the USA won Vietnam. I completely fell in love with this alternate 1985 universe, a world where they face their problems. As for the reason the movie was made, the plot, it was well written and the actors did a great job. Great underlying message in the end too, and the movie has a punchline that would make Heath Ledger's Joker jealous.<br/><br/>DO NOT TAKE THE KIDS TO GO SEE THIS, there are some very graphic sex scenes and extreme gore scenes. They don't dominate the movie, but they are a part of it.<br/><br/>I'm not the kind of person who likes a movie just because it's ""gore drenched"" or because it's ""sexy"", or even ""action-packed"". This movie could easily fulfill all of those criteria for anyone who does love that stuff while still satisfying the plot mongers like myself. I'm tempted to go see it again."

","... Tricky and the other kind. It is funny at first but distracting and mildly irritating later on.<br/><br/>Otherwise, some great performances (Jackie Earle Haley especially) and an interesting, if very dated premise. Alternate histories end up being fairly restricted to the narrow line of what changed to cause the principle effect (in this case, Nixon winning 5 terms instead of resigning) and the immediate vicissitudes that result. They often make overblown assumptions about what would have had to have changed (Woodward & Bernstein's assassinations instead of, say, an ounce of professional prudence on the part of Ben Bradlee) and what might have resulted (the end of the Cold War!!!) That might have been pretty ponderous stuff in 1985, when this was written. A few short years later the entire premise would be obsolete and remain so two decades later."

","Zach Snyder was able to conquer the impossible- adapting the popular graphic novel into a major motion picture. Many actors have attempted but Snyder has proved to be the most successful. Even die-hard fans of the comic can appreciate the movie. <br/><br/>Although Snyder had to omit sections of the novel due to time constraints, he was still able to adapt the comic in a concise manner. Most of the alterations Snyder made only allowed the graphic novel to translate appropriately to the big screen. <br/><br/>The movie is packed with attention-keeping visuals and the soundtrack is AMAZING. <br/><br/>A must see by all means."

","First up, an acknowledgment. I've never read the graphic novel. So my review is entirely based on the movie. Short version, 10/10, and simply brilliant.<br/><br/>For a starters, this movie --is not kid friendly--. This is a story for the adults, and it is well worth it. I've taken my nephew to see Ironman, The Incredible Hulk etc, this is not a movie in the same league, not even really in the same genre.<br/><br/>To describe the movie's plot, I feel, is to subtract from the whole. There are many things going on at once, and when talking to a friend I described it as ""Pulp Fiction"" in a comic book universe. On reflection, this really seems to me an accurate description. Whilst there are some 'comic book' moments of action and fighting etc, this movie is all about the story. There are a handful of stories going on at the same time and, honestly, each and every one was great.<br/><br/>Do not be fooled by the 'comic book' nature of the movie. The story line is one of the greatest I have seen in a while, where, at the end of the movie, I left wondering which 'side' I would choose. There is virtually no 'good guys and bad guys' situation, each character is a 3 dimensional person with flaws, good points, and bad.<br/><br/>Will be seeing again two or three times. Simply brilliant."
"C-Ant","5","2","5","13 March 2009"," Review By non-comic Fan
","OK, first up I wanna make it clear that I'm a movie fan, not a comic fan! I say this because the majority of reviews on this title seem to be from comic fans who are overwhelmed by the fact their favourite comic has been put onto film, and that seems to cloud their judgement - scoring it 8-10 and complaining about the ending and making huge reviews about how it varies from the comic! Fact is, tons of films are taken from literature, whether it's a short story, novel, comic or whatever. It's not about comparing material, it's about the film. OK got that off my chest.<br/><br/>So here it is, nice and short....the film is very average. Stop spitting on me! I say it how I see it! Not going into the story.<br/><br/>The film starts off very dark, a refreshing change for a 'super hero' yarn, and the characters are certainly interesting. The main story kept me gripped, the who 'dunnit' theme keeps it very interesting.....then it falls apart! It turns from a 'real-life' super hero flick, into something that resembles 'Power Rangers', I liked the 'Dr. Manhattan' thing, but it got very silly, very bad.<br/><br/>I read the comic book ending, and the argument about a different ending is negligible, it's proper geek turf, the ending is basically the same.<br/><br/>If this didn't kill 2.5 hours of my life I'd score it 7/10 But since it did, it's a 5/10 for me.<br/><br/>back off all you comic jockey's.........and get a girlfriend!"
"Whispery_Warrior","7","2","5","11 March 2009"," Who Walks Out of 'Watchmen'?
","Lest some of my comments to follow be overly negative, I will preface this review by stating forthright that I enjoyed the film overall and do appreciate the efforts of everyone involved to adapt material that's definitely not so easy to condense and for creating another ""mature"" comic book movie. Director Zack Snyder is about as faithful to the source material as could be expected without making the picture twice as long.<br/><br/>As a lifelong comic book reader and collector, it shames me to say I finished reading the graphic novel for the first time only a day prior to seeing the movie. Knowing how critically acclaimed Alan Moore's and Dave Gibbons' limited series remains almost 25 years after its initial release, I wanted to familiarize myself with the source material beforehand. While their work met my admittedly astronomical expectations, the film adaption failed to do the same in many regards.<br/><br/>Moore's and Gibbons' work stands as a brilliant deconstruction of the modern superhero, with stimulating commentary on relationships, contemporary sociopolitical issues, and human nature. Snyder's visually arresting piece does not critique or revolutionize the superhero genre to such a degree, but what it does do is present superheroes in a darker, more morally ambiguous light than most moviegoers are used to.<br/><br/>The most likable character in the movie is easily Rorschach, though even he is not quite as complex and intriguing as his graphic novel counterpart. Snyder's Rorschach comes across as an enigmatic, hard-nosed grinder who still manages to retain a morsel of sociability and humanity, whereas Moore's version struck me as a sociopathic loon. Nonetheless, Jackie Earle Haley does an excellent job in the role. The inkblot effects on his mask are very impressive.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian is spot-on. Would've been nice to see him in the gimp mask at least once, but no biggie.<br/><br/>Other than possibly Kovacs, Dr. Manhattan is my favorite character. I've heard a lot of complaints about his exposed penis. Osterman being nude is in keeping with Gibbons' illustrations. I had no problem with it, nor any qualms with Billy Crudup's portrayal of the physicist-turned-demigod. Then again, I am a fully grown adult who doesn't feel the need to cover his eyes or snicker at the mere sight of nudity.<br/><br/>Although Malin Akerman bears a strong resemblance to how I'd imagined a real-life Laurie ""Jupiter"" Juspeczyk would look, I didn't connect with Silk Spectre II on the silver screen nearly as deeply as I did while reading the graphic novel. There's something lacking in the character development department. Sweet eye candy, sure, but her performance leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>I felt similarly detached from Night Owl II despite Patrick Wilson giving a superior performance. Can't pinpoint exactly what intangible made it hard for me to connect with them, perhaps the missing or truncated Dreiberg/Hollis Mason and Laurie/Sally moments? Even with the gray hair and wrinkles, the original Silk Spectre, played by Carla Gugino, looks more like Laurie's sister than mother.<br/><br/>Matthew Goode's performance isn't as bad as I'd expected, but Ozymandias needed a stronger on-screen presence. Even though I knew his nature going in, I dislike how obvious Snyder makes it from the outset that Veidt is the diabolical mastermind. A brief explanation of his genetically altered pet Bubastis should've been included somewhere, because I know those unfamiliar with the background story must have been scratching their head about that (among other things).<br/><br/>With the exception of Dr. Manhattan, all the Watchmen are overpowered; these supposed normal human beings appear to possess superhuman speed/agility/strength/reflexes, which made me wonder whether they'd taken the Super Soldier Serum. I believe that Kung Fu and Matrix-style wirework don't really suit gritty, ""realistic"" street-level vigilantes. Unless the intention was to parody typical action movie fight scenes, the fights are way over-the-top and at the same time inconsequential, since none of them ever seemed to be in serious danger (except when fighting one another).<br/><br/>I didn't care for how violently Night Owl and Silk Spectre dispatched of their would-be robbers in the alleyway. It seemed totally out of character for them to maim and kill perpetrators so callously. You'd expect such methods from The Comedian or Rorschach, but not Dan and Laurie. A few other scenes might've been excessively gory as well, such as Rorschach's handling of the child kidnapper and his prison escape. Don't get me wrong, I'm not terribly squeamish about seeing blood and gore in movies, and the source material itself is quite violent, of course. It simply never struck me as excessive or only there for shock value, yet certain things sort of felt that way as I watched.<br/><br/>Clocking in at just under 3 hours, portions of the picture somehow manage to feel simultaneously drawn out and rushed at the same time. Jon and Laurie's conversation on Mars, for instance, lacks the dramatic impact it should have, due in part to its abruptness and abbreviation, yet I found myself wishing they'd breeze through it to keep the story moving along. Likewise, the final showdown is somewhat convoluted and anticlimactic considering the brevity of what transpires.<br/><br/>Technical issues keep this one from being a masterpiece: muddled storytelling and poor pacing chief among them. There's a baffling amount of flashbacks for a motion picture. Granted, said flashbacks are also present in the original work, but what works in one medium does not always work in another. I imagine all the jumping around between different decades and characters/situations would be a little confusing to the uninitiated.<br/><br/>Did I forget to mention the uninspired score? Songs in the trailers actually fit the movie's tone better than the soundtrack they used.<br/><br/>Hopefully the director's cut addresses some of these criticisms. Like '300', ultimately I found 'Watchmen' aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable but not wholly satisfying. Mr. Snyder clearly has a love for the material, though, so I can respect his enthusiasm and ambition."
"cyberpulse","3","2","5","11 March 2009"," The End is Nigh.
","I was excited for this movie after seeing the preview over the summer last year. I waited in anticipation for it for almost six months, reading everything I could about it on the internet. Keeping my fingers crossed that they would stick to the story. Zach Snyder disappointed me and a lot of other fans by changing the ending from the one in the book to one so ridiculous that I can't put into words how angry I was when I walked out of the theater. The details he deemed good enough to put in the movie that stuck with the original plot were well executed, but he tried to make it his own story and he failed miserably. Alan Moore's worst nightmare came true. One of the greatest stories ever written was dumbed down for the masses that had not read the novel. In trying to compress the story into a three hour movie there was so much of the original story left out."
"trevor-bath","10","2","5","10 March 2009"," It was a great movie
","I don't see what people are harping about. This was a great movie. Its repeat viewing material. The cast was STELLAR! The action was great, the effects were awesome, the pace was perfect, didn't feel like 2.5 hours. That is a sign when a movie is good, you don't check your watch. People single out Malin Akerman, and I don't see why they didn't like her performance. It was on par with every other performance. Jackie Earle, you are Rorschach.<br/><br/>I've read the comics. The ending in the movie was fitting. What is the perfect ending? This came very close. I'm sorry, but this was just as good or better then The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>I want to watch it again, I want to see the directors cut. I want to own it on Blu-Ray and watch it in IMAX. This was a movie lovers version of a comic book lovers story. Mr. Moore, it was film-able.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't complicated to follow. How can you get lost? The score was great, the music was great, the opening credits were fantastic.<br/><br/>If I had to complain, I wish I could watch it all over again and experience it again for the first time."
"Darth-Furious","9","2","5","9 March 2009"," A - for effort but really...
","What did you expect to see? It's just a movie.<br/><br/>There are some major quotes gone. No Kitty Genovese. No Hollis murder. No book stand and comic book kid. No Black Freighter. No minute long Ozy monologue. No homo reference neither (I like the idea of Ozy being a gay bad guy and the baddest prettiest mother on the team.) No real Rorshack/ Doctor Long exchange. No Manhattan tech-no-babble. Oh yeah and no squid. Get over it, I like this ending better, save for Ozy's final scene.<br/><br/>We all need to remember the ground rules.<br/><br/>1.A hero is not a superhero.<br/><br/>This ain't the book. It's that simple. It's damn good but not great. Somehow this work straddled the fence on what it wanted to give us. The film was not enough like the comic yet as faithful to the source material as any work I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Watchmen was a story I hadn't been witness to before a month ago. I had no idea. The fan boy neurotic exam that envelopes every fine step of Zack Snyder's effort has eluded me. I'm a newbie here. What I've seen in the book and in the motion comics (put out by Warners prior to this) was simply... beautiful. There is a complex, layered story. There is a pacing issue. There is a lot of talky talk. There is also clear cut and dried differences between the characters and an ambiguity of various moral, legal, and consequential dilemmas that sit with us long after our trip with the book is over. I read it and felt... dirty.<br/><br/>The film reveals each character in his or her own world, sets their stories in a swift effortless motion and keeps it moving. Almost in a paint by numbers manner but still good nonetheless. It felt like rolling thunder. You could feel the power, the build up and... and then... something stalled, plodded and choked the pace. That's when you realize - <br/><br/>2.A superhero is not a vigilante.<br/><br/>The attention to detail, the subtle character nuances, the voice work, the staging of scenes and arrangement of establishing shots is incredible. The costumes, the props, the production design, the slime and grit and filth on the streets. Like the city was sweating with anxiety all the way through. It's all there.<br/><br/>There are exact panels, full tilt, that are transferred onto film and laid out here. Indeed, this maybe the corrective nature of a story that seems to dip and dive through it's own plot and double back. Hollywood screenplay structure is null and void here. That's okay, there are moments of greatness that stride through the imagery and presentation. This is something special here. No doubt.<br/><br/>The Comedian was spot on, even through the two main (curiously) over-lit scenes of rotten sick indulgence he performed in. I say performed because he KNEW the futility of his will, their work as ""superheroes"" and everything they stood for.<br/><br/>Most other characterizations were (choose one) lost/ edited/ joined/ switched, ad libbed to screen - but non more so than Rorshach. Walter Kovacs IS NOT Rorschach. Kovacs is Rorschach's disguise, not the other way around. In the book that was the gospel... in the film, not so much. Everything looks swell and engaging but let's face reality here: Nite Owl was a loser, Laurie was a poser, Ozymandias was hanging with village people, arrogant, rich and sick with an accent (yeah, he must be the bad guy) all the while Dr. Manhattan could give a crap less. Oh yeah, and the world is on the brink of nuclear war, so...<br/><br/>3.A vigilante is not a hero.<br/><br/>Really. There's a difference. He's not a cop or a fireman or a doctor. Vigilantes rough people up, enjoy it for the most part and move on. That's what this film does. There are bone splitting, hacking brain, blood splattering moments that gut you like a fist BUT... to some, it may be too much. When you come to the realization that NO ONE could undoubtedly conjure the souls of mystic Moore past to indulge us with the girth and filth and fornication of Watchmen. It's too much like a good bottle of wine bred and strewn like a classic vineyard fine wine, aged twenty three years that has been sipped and savored by millions before. It's just not as good as the original.<br/><br/>But it never claims to be. This is an homage. There's no preliminary excuses or demoralizing analysts or deconstructing anecdote's to moan about. Snyder knows that. We all do. A lot more is done with a lot less in our own imaginations when we take in the book. What a mind screw for a comic book story? Even comparing the odd music cues, running inside jokes and many lost opportunities against the haunting score, stilted animation and scene editing of the motion comics is a task. So enjoy this for what it is - a movie.<br/><br/>Watchmen is supposed to be a character study/ deconstruct of the modern day superhero and it destroys our childish fascination with men and women in tights.<br/><br/>For the most part, Snyder gets it right. The meat of the tale is there. The psychological gray of what they believe and what we see them as filters through every scene. Inevitably some of the mud and filthy disgust is lost in translation but it sure is fun to look for it.<br/><br/>A hero is not a superhero.<br/><br/>A superhero is not a vigilante.<br/><br/>A vigilante is not a hero."

","I saw a screening of Watchmen today, and I knew walking in that the reviews were a bit mixed because of the idea of it being based off of a graphic novel. So I walked in forgetting that a novel existed, and I watched it as it's own individual movie. In this case, I happen to enjoy it very much.<br/><br/>Why I liked this film: First off, Zack Snyder is a genius when it comes to artistic film making. His idea of fast motion to slow motion fight scenes, and artistic motion capturing is phenomenal. It felt like 300, which I assume what going to happen when they said ""Visionary director of 300"" in the trailer. Along with an artistic environment, I also enjoyed the idea of a whole bunch of new faces that Hollywood hasn't paid much attention to. It was good to see some fresh new unknown faces on screen to play these roles instead of out commonly own overused actors today. They all did great with their roles and brought some fresh blood to the movie. Overall, what keeps this movie on the positive side is it's artistic value (Just like 300).<br/><br/>The negatives about this film: Yes I enjoyed the film, but the most important base of a film is the plot. The movie was way too plot heavy and had too much going on at once, I lost track half of the time. I also don't think they spent enough time on the past of the Watchmen, like how did they all learn to fight and get their high tech gear? truthfully, I think this film should have been split into 2 films. there would have been a lot more room for plot explanation, and a lot more could have been done. It was just too plot heavy. That's the major criticism Overall this is a good film. HOWEVER, you WILL NOT enjoy this film if you go into the theater expecting a perfect adaptation of the graphic novel because to be honest, it doesn't follow it that well. Take it for it's own movie. Go and watch it for the soul purpose of seeing it as it's own movie, not to relate it to the novel, otherwise you will not enjoy it for silly reasons."
"Markbruinekreeft","8","2","5","9 March 2009"," A pleasant surprise. Not perfect, but still good.
","Long story short: I thought this was a pretty good film, and a relatively faithful adaptation of the comic. I'll be the first to admit that the story has been dumbed down a bit, in the sense that quite a lot of the finer points and intricacies from the comic have been omitted (no Black Freighter, for example). I suppose it was either this or let this film bloat into an impossible-to-watch 8-hour behemoth. But the main points, themes and plot have been translated onto the big screen quite faithfully, however. The main characters still ultimately fail to become ""true"" heroes and the writers resisted the temptation to tweak the story so there'd be more of a ""Hollywood-style"" happy ending. (Thank god!)<br/><br/>Acting is also pretty good. All characters come off as three-dimensional, believable and as real, flawed human beings. Which was one of the major points of the comic. Even the more outlandish characters, like Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan come across as believable. And yes, I do realize that I'm talking about a naked blue demigod and a misanthropic cynic in a mask here. <br/><br/>The one major thing I disliked was the stylized way fights and action scenes were depicted, and the tweaking of most people's costumes to make them look less ridiculous. After all, the ""superheroes"" from this comic weren't designed to look cool. This makes me wonder if the director somehow just didn't get that part of the joke. Either that, or he decided to stick in jazzed-up fighting scenes and less stupid costumes to draw in lovers of more regular superhero flicks. Admittedly, said action scenes do look quite impressive; well choreographed and engaging. But as said, they do seem to contradict some of the more essential points of the comic's story; the main characters are,ultimately, (arguably) failures and not butt-kicking heroes. <br/><br/>All in all, a pretty good effort. Don't go watch this film if you're a die-hard Watchmen purist, or if you're expecting a normal superhero film in which the guy in tights saves the day and gets the girl. But if you're familiar with the source material but not too narrow-minded to check out another artists' vision of it, or just a film lover willing to get a bit off the beaten track, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this film to you."

The pacing is odd, the climaxes are off, blah X 3. I can so understand why some audiences feel ""undecided"", ""meh"" or even ""torn"" about the film.... To Zack Snyder-- ""slo-mo/ panning/ etc."" alone does not make a scene more exciting/ important/ beautiful/ etc., you need to ""set it up"" (with directing/ scripting/ acting/ etc.).<br/><br/>So there is only 1 really good thing I can say about this movie-- it made me want to read the graphic novel (which I haven't).

","Seeing Watchmen has sold out tickets, has had long lines and has already received several reviews on websites, the film appears nothing short of a success. While I do agree that the ending does bog down a tad with its over-dialogue--all the while confusing novel readers alike--the comic book labeled ""unfilmable"" has been completed to near perfection.<br/><br/>For lack of naming actors, the performances of Rorschache and Nite Owl were arguably the best, while critically-bashed Silk Spector II and Ozymandias were much better than given credit for. I thought Silk was the center of the film's sense of humor (as well as the sex, obviously) and Ozymandias was not given the proper back story to build up his character: the Alexander The Great-influence; his family's wealth; how did he become this ultimate ideal of such strength and intelligence? And so sure, he doesn't look like Robert Redford, either. Oh well.<br/><br/>Watchmen excels with a great opening credit sequence (one of the best ever), beautiful set design and costume (they nailed it), cool tunes (other than an unneeded Tears For Fears instrumental) and outstanding cinematography (didn't rely on lame camera tricks). Director Zach Snyder's use of CGI within the film was especially great, none better than that of Jon Osterman a.k.a. Dr. Manhattan. It's true, if you haven't read the book, you're not going to be nearly as amazed with how superb Snyder captures Jon's presence and dialogue within the movie. Film critics have also claimed that the Mars' sequences look cheesy. Are you kidding me? It was beautiful. The working gears of Jon's new home nailed the reference to the outer realms of time and space. Maybe the newspapers were cutting the budget, not allowing critics the IMAX treatment. Really, Watchmen has some of the best CGI ever put to film.<br/><br/>The fight and action scenes (i.e. the opening death, the alley fight with Dan & Laurie, the prison break sequence) were excellent. They did include Snyder's signature slow-motion, extreme gore, and sheer violence (ala 300) without making it a farce. The black humor and sensitivity of the novel (i.e. Comedian's breakdown, Rorchache acknowledging friendship) gave new fans that much needed balance. Being a hardcore graphic novel and comic book geek, it was even easier to understand more of the Watchmen's analogies, themes and messages from seeing it in live action. That's a plus.<br/><br/>It wasn't hard to receive goose bumps and anxiety from watching the Watchmen. If only those feelings remained towards the end of the film (it's a little different, yes, but the overall meaning is still there), I would say Snyder's adaptation of the Watchmen is perfect. There's no fault in being ""too faithful to the book."" There is a fault, however, for not giving this outstanding achievement in cinema a few hours of your time.<br/><br/>****"
"timdoggiedreams-1","9","2","5","8 March 2009"," A breakthrough film for the comic book genre
","I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say this: Watchmen is to comic book movies what The Clash's ""London Calling"" was to music. Not brand new... or I would have referenced The Ramones. Sin City, 300, and The Dark Knight are all precursors. But the movie is such a new amalgamation, such a new spin on an old genre, that it is kind of stunning.<br/><br/>It's long, involved... a lot happens, and yet in other ways, very little happens. A friend told me to bring no-doze, he was so bored by it. So maybe you'll be bored, too? But if The Dark Knight got it's foot in the door on reinventing the comic book movie? Watchmen kicks the door down and deconstructs it into a gory, fascinating, piece of modern furniture.<br/><br/>One interesting side-note. I thought as I came out the film, despite all the good work done in the past 10 years by directors like Alexander Payne, Clint Eastwood, Paul Greengrass, and others... the movies that are likely to draw the most ink or future twitters about this era - and surprisingly, with the most to say about our times - have actually been SF or comic book movies like the first two Matrix films, X-Men 2, Revenge of the Sith, TDK, and Watchmen. If I'm wrong on this, challenge me. But when was the last time you saw an indie or foreign language film with political or cultural commentary as involved as any of the aforementioned films? With the possible exception of Slumdog Millioniare, which was visually stunning. But in many ways, was almost a traditional Capraesque throwback film.<br/><br/>Don't wait for Watchmen on DVD. Go see this in the theater and be mesmerized by everything good and bad about it. It will take you somewhere, though I can't guarantee everyone will like that. But you won't see or feel anything else like it in the theaters this year."
"bondgirl6781","5","2","5","7 March 2009"," Fascinating graphic novel. movie droning and too long, but more Rorschach
","I am a fan of graphic novels and some of the films inspired after them. I loved Sin City, 300, and yes, I enjoyed The Spirit. I never have high expectations for films but I left the film slightly disappointed. Based the graphic novel and made the filmmakers of Sin City and 300, ""Watchmen"" is the anti-hero comic book/graphic novel film. I don't mind lengthy films but I do mind lengthy films that drone! ""Watchmen"" is visually striking and action sequences are graphic but exciting however the film had too many subplots and kept jumping back and forth between stories within the main story itself which is suppose to be about solving the murder of a superhero, Edward aka The Comedian Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the reemergence of the heroes called the Watchmen. Narrating the story (or stories) is Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) and he attempts to reunite the other Watchmen: Nightowl (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre (Malin Ackerman), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), and the main hero, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Cruddup). The only saving grace this film has are the performances by Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Haley as the deep-throated and enigmatic Rorschach is absolutely remarkable and exciting. He became the only character in the whole film that I actually cared about. About two hours into the film I begged for the film to reach a conclusion. I think after Watchmen I will lay off the comic book inspired films until a third Batman movie comes out. This one really will wear you out and not even the stunning visuals will help except for the performance of Jackie Earle Haley. I would definitely love it if the filmmakers made a film about Rorschach only."
"michael11391","9","2","5","7 March 2009"," Watchmen is a visually, eye-catching great movie.
","Let me start off with the visual effects. The visual effects are amazing to say the least, the visuals for Dr. Manahattan were exhilarating and very well-made! One of the best visual effects ever put on film and for fans who loves Dr. Manahattan, will not be disappointed. Which brings to performances, Malin Akerman was absolutely bad ass as Silk Spectre and was awesome in this, in the next few years people are going to remember her for this role, look for more of her in the future of movies. Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg/Night Owl II gave a very good performance, good actor. But the highlights of the film are: Billy Crudup and Jackie Earle Haley. Billy Crudup was absolutely perfect and wasn't just playing Dr. Manahattan, he was him. Jackie Earle Haley had my favorite performance in the movie, let's just say he OWNED as Rorschach and was just as good as Heath Ledger's amazing performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight only difference, he wasn't a villain. Both Crudup and Haley gave Oscar-worthy performances, they both should get the nod. And last but not least, Jeffery Dean Morgan did a great job as The Comedian but I expected it more from him.<br/><br/>Who do watches the Watchmen? I do and i'm telling you to watch this spectacular film, you won't be disappointed. Watchmen is indeed a very long movie but that doesn't matter because the visual effects, performances and action-packed cool sequences won't bore you at all. The movie is complex & doesn't have any villains, there's just good guys/bad guys all around and that's the brief spoiler I will give you. P.S., another spoiler: those who are expecting crazy & unnecessary slow-mo's are wrong, the slow-mo's were awesome and wasn't used that much, Snyder put those slow-mo's at the right and perfect scenes."

","This movie is mixed bag. The plot is intriguing. The special effects are well done. The acting is decent. The movie's creators were very faithful to the source material-almost slavishly so. <br/><br/>I think it was mistake to set the movie in the same era as the comic. The comic took place in the 80's, but that is when it was written. Perhaps they could have updated the story as ""Iron Man"" did last year. All the old music and cultural reference made me fell like I was watching one of those TV movies like ""The Sixties"" or ""The Seventies"" that NBC did a while ago. They should have toned it down a little. Not only is it the 80's, it's an alternate 80's where Nixon is still president. (What is with Nixon being so prominently featured in movies lately?) If they took the Nixon scenes out, I would not complain. That aspect of the movie might have been very confusing if I hadn't already read the comic. <br/><br/>The violence and the sexual content in the movie were graphic, even more so than in the comic from what people have said. I don't remember because I haven't read it in a while. The characters are all morally ambiguous for the most part. Some of the nihilism and reductionism(probably from the comic itself) just seems silly, particularly Dr. Manhattan's comment about living and dead organisms being indistinguishable because they have the same number of particles. <br/><br/>I though the complex interplay of good and evil was much more well done in the Dark Knight. On the other hand, Rorshach's devotion to truth here is more admirable than Batman's was at the end of the latter movie."
"tmann450","8","2","5","7 March 2009"," If you've read the book you'll love it...
","... Otherwise I don't know if it would work so well. I have read the book and as far as book to movie adaptations I was fairly surprised at how well this movie accomplished it. The problem is that the book was very long for a graphic novel (a great read but there was just more too it than most) so this forced a montage of back story in the beginning of the film that makes sense if you read the book but probably not as much if you haven't.<br/><br/>I thought the cast did an amazing job portraying the characters in general but I give special props for Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) and Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) for really becoming their characters and giving impressive performances each. I also give them credit because they had possibly the two hardest characters to play in the story. Rorschach is essentially a crafty bad-ass, not like Terminator bad-ass but more subtle, as well as being psychologically damaged from a rough childhood and past experiences fighting crime. He doesn't seem deep at first glance but anyone who read the book would probably agree he's by far the most interesting character. Dr. Manhattan is also incredibly hard to play because he's a person who started out as a human being and was turned into a being who could form/rearrange matter. I thought they did a great job explaining his back-story. Everything from how he became what he is, to how the name was chosen, and even how he used his powers or how others used his powers.<br/><br/>As far as story goes Watchmen has one of the best. It is a great character study and is really a deeply philosophical question of what is right and wrong. The big question raised at the end of the movie as well as the book is whether the end result justifies the extreme means to get there. The best part about the whole story is to this day I still don't know who I think was right and who was wrong because both sides of the story have valid arguments. Forgive me for not going deeper into this but I really don't know how to explain it without giving it away so my advise would be to read the book first if at all possible but the movie is certainly worth seeing."

","I saw the prescreening on Tuesday night in Minnesota with about 400 other excited viewers. The scene was quite a spectacle. As this film is an adaptation of a highly followed graphic novel there is a lot of pressure for Watchmen to adhere to its roots and for the most part it has done a very good job doing so. In regard to the integrity of original characters, plot, action and point of view. The exception being the a few original characters left out and a different ending. We need to remember this is an adaptation not a remake and this adaptation is in a different medium and is trying to reach a larger more broad audience so naturally, there are going to be differences. This difference(s) become amplified if you are expecting very precise mold of the original.<br/><br/>What I found to be a curious parallel between the graphic novel and its film counter part is, in the graphic novel a large message or concern is the growing desensitization of the public to sex and violence. The interesting part is that the film ""Watchmen"" holds so much violence and sex that is it actually serving as one of the instruments that desensitizes Americans today.<br/><br/>In all, this film has wonderful cinematography, great action, brilliant special effects, and a good story. So if you can put down you Watchmen novel and not over compare the two so closely, this film should raise dialog and and conversation prove to be highly entertaining -"

","Watchmen was a brilliant adaptation of Alan Moore's limited series, containing enough of the original material to satisfy a dedicated Watchmen fan, but with enough variation to justify the $120 spent on filming it. It achieves the perfect balance of loyalty and creativity.<br/><br/>I have only two problems with the film. Firstly, the film relies to heavily on the viewer having read the book. I have read the book, but I cannot imagine anybody who has not really understanding the film--too much material is cut from the film, though I look forward to seeing the director's cut when it is released on DVD.<br/><br/>My other problem has to do with the action sequences. I felt they were too unrealistic, and that a simple introduction to Newton's laws would not only make the movie more enjoyable, but would probably be easier to film. (For example, in many of the action sequences, a punch or a kick from one of the characters will send the person being hit across a room, while the attacking character remains firmly in place.)<br/><br/>Overall, I felt Watchmen to be an excellent adaptation of an excellent book, but I feel that it will probably only appeal to readers of the original series. (Thad doesn't mean you shouldn't see it if you haven't read the book--it means you should read one of the greatest books ever written and then go see the movie.)"

","The reviews have been mixed, and therefore it was with some trepidation that I went to see this. Despite being a lifelong comic book fan and having read the original book back in 1986. Oh wow! As good as if not better than Blade Runner. This film will run on forever just like that one. Everyone was excellent. Especially Rorschach. If there is no Oscar for Jack Earle Haley playing him, there is no justice at all. Malin Ackerman too. Awesome. Not 'eye candy' like some clowns have said. Her character is the central role in the story, so she had to be more than that. She played it brilliantly. Also extremely well acted was Patrick Wilson's take on Night Owl. A middle aged man with problems some fifteen years older than the actor himself. Now that is good!<br/><br/>90% faithful to the book which seems impossible, but true.I loved it all except the guy playing Nixon's rubber nose which was a tad silly. <br/><br/>The only thing could really fault was the horrendous Bob Dylan cover by My Chemical Romance played at the end. I agree with other posters that this was out of context and in the wrong film. Not only that, but it is probably the worst track they have ever made. It sounded like it was made in one afternoon's jam session - it was crap! Why put this this incongruous awful music on the end ? Was it done to make the goths go to the cinema to boost takings ? What possessed the Producers to throw red paint at their otherwise beautiful movie ?"
"bobsgrock","8","2","5","7 March 2009"," For what it's worth, it's astonishing.
","Prior to going to see this film last night, I was overlooking some critic reviews ans was rather surprised to hear their response. A good bit of them were panning the film calling it superfluous and plodding. Going into this picture, I knew I had to take some of these elements very lightly as this is based on a graphic novel with not a real sense of reality along with the 160 minute running time. Still, based solely as a piece of film making, which is how I viewed it without comparing it to its original material at all, I found it to be visually stunning as well as occupying a heart, something usually lacking in superhero flicks.<br/><br/>To surmise the plot, the year is 1985 in an alternate universe where Richard Nixon is president for a fifth term, the US and Russia are on the brink of nuclear destruction, and superheroes are a part of everyday life and culture. Here, they have been around since the 1940s and continue to evolve and fit into the society that changes constantly. Now, one of their own as been viciously murdered and the most mysterious of the Watchmen, Rorschach is on his own manhunt to find the killer. He comes across his old pals including Nite Owl II, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan. Together again, they now must fight the world that will end without them, their own personal demons and each other amidst a nearing apocalypse.<br/><br/>Again, going only on the film aspects, this does triumph in more ways than I think people are giving it credit for. Despite the running time, director Zack Snyder gives adequate insight to each superhero showing their past in flashback as well as what has led them to this point. This is wondrous to behold as we get to see a variety of people who have been called upon to save the world when they need saving from themselves or the situation they find themselves in. The acting is mostly great with Jackie Earl Hayley as Rorschach, the narrator, perfectly capturing his brutal manner and grisly voice. Patrick Wilson is also terrific as an overweight, mild-mannered geek Dan Dreiberg who once masqueraded as a superhero but now is reduced to working in his basement. Malin Akerman, I can't really say is that convincing as an actress but she does look good in tights. Perhaps the most sympathetic character is Jon Otterman, also known as Dr. Manhattan, a glowing blue superman who is almost like a demi-god in the fact that he isn't limited by time and space. Because of this, caused by and accident in the lab, he is also in his own world and unable to connect to really anyone outside of himself.<br/><br/>I know why some people would really not like this film as the tone is incredibly grim and the plot is sometimes convoluted. Still, there is not doubt in the visual effects, which are ground-breaking and beautiful at the same time. As I said before, the acting is mostly great with some characters not cast for talent as much as for looks. Director Snyder handles this material, which I am told is unfilmable, with a deft hand and is mostly successful, save for a completely unnecessary sex scene in the middle set to the song ""Hallelujah."" Of course, no one else will complain about that, but despite that and several plot holes, Watchmen is astonishing and although it's much too early, is probably the best film of 2009. Enjoy it for what it is and understand the movies are headed in this direction. Change is coming to all of us, no matter what we do."

","Saw this uber-hyped movie about 3 hours ago & was left with mixed feelings...<br/><br/>Most reviews seem to be anchored in the debate between rabid fan boy adoration of the graphic novel (or COMIC) & anticipated failure of the filmic adaption - how many times can reviewers say ""Unfilmable"" ? I wont even attempt to go there - enjoyed the comic, hoped the film would do it justice - but its a film & should be reviewed as such.<br/><br/>So its late, I don't feel intellectual & frankly cant compete with some of the more in depth reviews available: The acting was (mostly) excellent. The effects were excellent. The music was excellent (though sometimes inappropriate). 2 hours plus is a big ask from an audience in cramped cinema conditions but the interest & curiosity factors fared well.<br/><br/>For me, I admire the movies braveness more than any other factor - the length, violence, male nudity, grim & twisty ending....cant explain without blowing it for Watchmen virgins...all add up to what must be one of the greatest movie gambles of recent years. Cool.<br/><br/>Loved The Comedian - Dirty Harry meets Randall P McMurphy by way of Wolverine. Would love to see a film about this guy on his own but of course is not to be..... Loved Rorschach - Perfect transformation from page to film & perhaps even improvement..... Doc Manhattan - fine performance if you can see past the swinging schlong ! Silk Specter 2 - I may be the only guy alive left unmoved by her latex & generally annoyed by her presence. <br/><br/>I left the cinema thinking I had seen a very good film - impressed. But...I didn't want to see it again, buy the DVD, soundtrack etc. Well, maybe a directors cut...<br/><br/>Mr. Snyder did a fantastic job of covering the story & the actors did a fantastic job of bringing those great characters to life - but somehow emotion got lost during the trip - I was appreciating the film more than enjoying it. Sorry, cant nail down the reason why but that's what I was left with.<br/><br/>A very honorable & honest 8/10"
"jdesando","Null","2","5","4 March 2009"," Cerebral and entertaining
","Dr. Manhattan/John Osterman (Billy Crudup): ""Why would I save a world I no longer have any stake in?"" <br/><br/>It's not difficult to see why geeks all over the world love Alan Moore and David Gibbons' Watchmen graphic novel heroes if the complex, cerebral, and entertaining film of the same name is any indication. Heroes filled with angst, lust, and revenge rummage around the screen trying to make sense of their existential lives while figuring out how to save the world from nuclear holocaust. As he did in 300, director Zack Snyder makes memorable images surrounding challenging ideas.<br/><br/>It is an alternate world of 1985 when Richard Nixon has a third term facing the awful decision to use nuclear weapons against Russia rather than allow it to bomb us first. That the ex-Mask superheros Watchmen are variously found to cause the nuclear tension while they come back to save the world is the delicious complication of this challenging film.<br/><br/>Long it is at 161 minutes, but satisfying it is in the range of human emotions and conflicts befitting bickering gods of Greek legend and Star Trek fantasies. In fact, the godlike Dr. Manhattan is an authentic superhero, a scientist transformed by bad experiment into a superman deficient in the emotions the gods, from Browning to Roddenberry, have traditionally coveted.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach/Walter Kovacs, providing the voice-over narrative about the return of the heroes, has a mask with floating inkblots, appropriately signaling the ambiguity of the hero and the world he is saving. But besides the satisfyingly ambiguous roles of the advanced X-Men like heroes, is a musical score equally spot on for meaning but also ironic in the extreme.<br/><br/>For instance, after failing to rise to the occasion of intimacy with Silk Spectre II/Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman), Night Owl II/Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) eventually responds by being aroused after heroic activity with her accompanied by the strains of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, both a sensual accompaniment and a send up of heroic seriousness. Additionally, Philip Glass's accompaniment to Dr. Manhattan's back story is close to perfection. <br/><br/>The pure goal of all superhero stories is best described by Ozymandias/Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode): ""And so began my path to conquest. Conquest not of men, but of the evils that beset them."""

","""Watchmen"" is an obviously ambitious movie. They are gathering of superheroes in the fictional modern world where Richard Nixon was still US President well into the 1980s. Director Zach Snyder (who burst into the scene in a big way with ""300"") ups his ante with more violence, gore, bloodshed and a considerably more complex inter-weaving multiple story lines.<br/><br/>It is really overwhelming for someone who has not read the so-called ""best graphic novel in the world,"" and thus have no idea who these characters are at the start. But you know what, the innovative title credits sets the mood right off. And later on, you do learn about each character very well enough to care about them towards the middle and end.<br/><br/>I am still not really clear on what the superpowers of the mysterious Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) and innate good guy Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson)up to now, but I would know what kind of person they are by the way these topnotch actors have essayed these complex characters. Mr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is a buff and unabashedly naked blue CG image almost throughout the whole film, yet it was still very effective in conveying this super-being's thought processes, despite his blank eyes. The raw physicality and conflicted character of The Comedian was very well limned by actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan.<br/><br/>The main antagonist Ozymandias I felt was the weak link in the cast. As played by Matthew Goode, he did not really look like a menacing super-villain nor did he even look like ""the smartest man"" on earth that he supposedly was. Malin Akerman had a lot riding on her as the main female character Silk Spectre II. She is quite sexy and all, but somehow her performance as a superhero was not too convincing.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good enough introduction to the ultra-violent world of the Watchmen for the uninitiated. But this movie is not really for everybody. The younger male demographic is definitely the target audience, despite the overt frontal exposures of Mr. Manhattan. As far as graphic novels go, I still prefer ""Sin City"" and ""300"". I have to confess that the violence content of ""Watchmen"" went a bit beyond my comfort limit."
"glaaaaadiator","5","4","15","5 March 2009"," You'll Watch The Watchmen - Once.
","A case of staying a little TOO faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>While it's cool to see some of the images translated directly to the screen (and in IMAX), the script also borrows a bit too much of the dialogue directly from the page, which doesn't always work - the movie fails to flesh out the characters enough to fill the big screen for nearly three hours. Only Patrick Wilson manages to evoke any real sympathy and hint at a person who might be three-dimensional under the makeup/costume. I also liked Billy Crudup's performance as Dr. Manhattan, but since he's essentially playing an emotionless time bomb, our empathy doesn't lie with him. As in the source material, it's pretty easy to predict who the ""villain"" is, though his motivation here is muddled and unconvincing - hinging on the typical last-minute ""bad guy explains wicked plot"" exposition (which didn't work so well in Moore's book, either, but suffers even more in the movie). Rorschach once again provides the dark heart of the story, though I wish they hadn't made him deliver all his lines in that Christian-Bale-as-Batman voice. He's supposed to be a twisted take on Raymond Chandler-esquire gumshoes, but all that growling makes it hard to take him seriously.<br/><br/>As expected, there are a few terrific action sequences, though the film could have used more of them, and expanded upon what's in the book. Some of them seem too short. It was refreshing to see very adult-level sex and nudity in a comic book film - although I have to say it, the constant presence of Dr. Manhattan's penis gets incredibly, almost laughably, distracting. It should come as no surprise that the director of 300 lingers most on the graphic violence - but without the weight and depth of the book, it comes across more like torture porn than Moore probably intended. The gruesomeness of the graphic novel always seemed to be serving a larger, cautionary purpose - here, it's much less tasteful.<br/><br/>That's the crucial shortcoming of Watchmen the movie - Zack Snyder's inability to grasp the meaning behind Watchmen, and why it was so groundbreaking in the first place. He doesn't quite seem in on the joke that this is a sendup of the greed and violence present in American culture - and the heroes we invent to cope with that. He's much more interested in bringing the violence and images to life than he is the insight into human nature and larger themes. The graphic novel made doomsday feel imminent and terrifying, but here it's just a plot device - the tried-and-true ""Manhattan in peril"" formula. This works overall until the third act, which feels forced (and not merely because of the one major deviation from the source material - I'd say the last few chapters of the comics is where Moore's storytelling faltered a bit, too, though not to the extent it does here).<br/><br/>Watchmen deserved a visionary filmmaker to expand upon the daring, revolutionary genius of the graphic novel; instead it got one who is merely faithful to it, without making the additions necessary to translate it to the silver screen. It's fun to watch, but it doesn't get under your skin like Alan Moore's comics or give you much reason to care what's happening. Worth watching once for the overall coolness factor, but doesn't nearly pack the same emotional punch as the graphic novel."
"Baldrick44","10","3","10","5 March 2009"," Zack Snyder's Watchmen, not Alan Moore's or Dave Gibbon's
","As a guy who has read the comic book and thinks it's the most influential book ever written in the genre ( though I actually don't think it's Alan Moore's best work- I think that title goes to V for Vendetta ), I was both excited and worried. Excited that these larger than life characters would get their shot on the big screen, but worried in that I wondered how such a densely layered text could make the transition from comic to movie without losing its soul.<br/><br/>Fortunately though Zack Snyder has done an excellent job keeping the spirit of the book intact- but what must be remembered is that it is his vision of the Watchmen world. If you are looking for Alan Moore's dialogue cramming every scene you'll be disappointed ( though the movie amply borrows lines straight from the text ) and the same goes for the artwork.<br/><br/>Acting wise this movie is very good, with solid performances by all the actors- but 2 standouts are from Jackie Earle Haley as the sociopathic adventurer Roarsharch and Jeffery Dean Morgan as the nihilistic, cynical Comedian. Both actors have tough, complex roles but convince you completely ( Earle's voice as Roarsharch is particularly...compelling ). Unfortunately, Matthew Goode as Ozymadias just doesn't manage to pull off the right amount of pathos for his role, which as the movie continues, lets it down slightly.<br/><br/>The other little wrangles I have is with the soundtrack which is at times great and at times...mystifying. I like All Along the Watchtower as much as the next guy, but when it begins to obscure the dialogue, it's a bit much. On the other hand, the montage at the beginning with the Times They are a Changin' was wonderfully done; a beautiful piece of cinematography. Again though, the song in the credits sort of ruined the last moment slightly for me. Also the sex scene in the middle went on for too long. I don't know if Zack Snyder was trying to be arty or just trying to express how much they had been aroused but it became boring to watch.<br/><br/>This is not my favourite superhero movie of all time- the Dark Knight still holds that title- but what it does achieve is a remarkable attempt to make a truly fantastic novel more accessible to people. There are flaws, mostly due to the changes that have been made in order to make it more accommodating to the film medium, but out of all the Alan Moore adaptations, this is by far the best."

","I was lucky enough to view an early screening of the movie and when I sat down with my popcorn I was hyper as ever. The aspect of the movie that shocked me most, which was not advertised in the trailer is how many comedic scenes that are going to be present. This element did not damper the experience I had too much because most jokers were funny but I went in believing that this movie was going to be very dark (have not read the GN). This addition of comedy for me immediately takes it out of the legendary film categories.<br/><br/>The film has brilliant action with gore that stands up to the likes of Saw! CGI present was also on par with what film goers are used too. The music from Tyler Bates certainly tries to recreate some of his brilliance from 300 in this film and when you recognise this while watching it reminds you that you don't have to take this piece of art so seriously but too enjoy that same brilliantly choreographed scenes and that standing up out of your seat shouting ""YAH, you just got owned!!"" feeling that you received from 300. <br/><br/>The film did drag on a bit too long and the side affects of this are looking down at your watch every so often as well as reminiscing the adrenaline pumping fight sequences earlier in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall I very much enjoyed the film which entertained me thoroughly and appreciated the beautifully created scenery present. I recommend you see this film in the Cinema the way it is meant to be seen."

","In an alternate 1985, superheroes and costumed vigilantes exist. They formed the Minutemen in 1940 but the . Nixon is the president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed by a skilled assassin. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) thinks that somebody is trying to kill all the heroes. Dan Dreiberg aka Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is semi-retired and thinks Rorschach is too paranoid. Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a wealthy celebrity. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the all-powerful all-seeing indestructible superhero. Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) had put away her Silk Spectre identity and trying to maintain a human relationship with Dr. Manhattan. Her mother Sally (Carla Gugino) was the original Silk Spectre but is now a drunk.<br/><br/>It's a dark ambitious world that Zack Snyder and friends have created. It may be too ambitious but they really gave it their all. It's got a great style. Some may complain about changes from the graphic novel. That's always a failed argument for me. I do have some minor complaints about the ending but I'm not saying there are easy solutions. It oversimplifies world politics and distorts human nature. Malin Akerman does a good job despite the naysayers. Dr. Manhattan digs into some existential questions. I like everybody especially Jackie Earle Haley's performance. There are many great aspects that they easily smooth out any bumps in the road."

","Hello.<br/><br/>My concerns with this film are many. I was incredibly upset that Billy Crudup was cast to play a glowing man. Billy Crudup is a great actor and he is better when he is not glowing. Or blue. This seems to be a huge oversight by the casting team. I am however amazed that an emotionless, big, blue, glowing man can maintain relationships with women.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I do like bag face man, however I wish his voice wasn't 'exactly like Batman'. Equally, boring glass wearing geek man has a suit 'exactly like Batman'. I remember at university they were pretty big on plagiarism, so I'm quite surprised that the same marking scheme does not apply in Hollywood.<br/><br/>My favourite thing about this film was probably the HUGE translucent clock machine on Mars. I really feel like I could connect with that, and it allowed for a rare moment of calm and aesthetic beauty. Meanwhile, the horny tiger was a bit much, and I wouldn't be surprised if that is the reason that this film was rated 'R'.<br/><br/>In summary; bag face man = good. Blue glowing man = emotionless but good with women.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time."

","I rented the bluray edition of this movie which meant that I had to sit through over three hours of a plot that kept jumping from present to past and from boring character to boring character. For a non-comic-book-reader like myself, I could have used more character background--I was totally lost, and as a result, uninterested. I kept waiting for the good part to happen because the previews were great. I thought I was getting to that good part (about two hours into the movie), but it was short lived. How is it that you cast someone as gorgeous as Carla Gugino but you put her in old person's makeup for most of the movie? I don't know how anybody could give this movie a 9/10 or a 10/10 rating. I reserve those ratings for movies like Million Dollar Baby or Schindler's list. This movie was nowhere near the level of other comic book films like Spiderman, Batman, or even the original Superman."
"drqshadow-reviews","5","2","6","28 March 2012"," A Valiant Effort, But Ultimately a Failed One
","This may be the most literal film adaptation of a print property we'll ever see, but that alone can't make it half as successful as it could have been. Having grown up with the trade paperback by my bedside, a holy grail of sorts for comic book fanatics, it's almost a religious experience to see these themes, characters and visuals represented so loyally on the big screen. As he did with 300, Zac Snyder has absolutely nailed the look and feel of the comics, breathtakingly, but underneath that dazzling surface is a terrible lack of soul, conviction and character. With the exception of Jackie Earl Haley, who is absolutely magnificent as the mentally teetering vigilante Rorschach, this is a large collection of miscast characters which never really seem to buy into what they're saying or doing. The words are right, ripped line-for-line from the bubbles and narrative boxes of the comics, and of course everyone looks great, but bland inflections, bad interpretations and a hectic, compressed timeframe strip away the power of the plot's weightiest moments. In a way it's TOO loyal, as it's surprisingly the one major moment that steps away from the guiding hands of the source material - a significant tweak to the story's conclusion - that works the best. Snyder was ambitious to tackle such a booby-trapped property, and to do so with such a passionate love for its roots is admirable, but there's a reason it was dubbed unfilmable for so many years. There's so much going on at any given moment that even the most familiar reader runs the risk of being bucked, and even at three hours, a large portion of the story is left on the cutting room floor. And for Watchmen, those seemingly-dispensable character moments are every bit as important as the heaviest plot developments."
"leo-pontinen","Null","2","6","11 October 2011"," Just let it be surreal violence. Don't pretend it's something more.
","Violence has always been the source of entertainment whether we are talking about movies or video games. The dramatic change occurred when the the people of today, apathetically feeding out of entertainment, actually found violence without drama or philosophical bases boring and insulting. That was when we started to have movies that were/are made for people wanting to see that usual content but which were this time filled up with more intellectual stuff. Watchmen is one of these examples.<br/><br/>Judging from the evolving level of our current society here, I have always assumed that we know where violence stands. Entertainment is entertainment and I respect that. To each his own. Taking a look at the director Zack Snyder's previous two films you can easily predict how the film is going to be. That was what I did. I expected to see lots of physical harm, limbs moving around or something similar and got prepared for it. So, why had they seen so much trouble trying to make the movie be more than physical harm, limbs moving around or something when it clearly was about that?<br/><br/>When you have two people hitting themselves for almost a minute, don't try pretending the fight itself wasn't your interest. There is a difference between violence that is the part of a bigger story and violence that is just there for itself.<br/><br/>The final indication of this movie's true target audience is the way they handled the philosophy. Every time I could have had something to think by myself, the characters in the movie explained those things to me so fundamentally that all I needed to do was drool. Maybe the scriptwriters knew that the ethical questions were too hard to be just visually presented to the audience for pondering.<br/><br/>Positively, this movie did feel somewhat refreshing, maybe because of it's surreal content and it's tone changing ridiculously often. I don't think this movie is the best example of an action movie desperately trying to pass off as a serious masterpiece. If you want better alternatives of those, you can go see Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>So, how will you enjoy this movie? Just put popcorn in your mouth, let your brain cells go and try to ignore the fact that you might be deluded to actually use them during the movie."
"Sisiutil","6","2","6","27 December 2010"," Faithful to its source, visually compelling, but lacking emotional depth
","(Please note that my comments are based upon the director's cut DVD.)<br/><br/>Zack Snyder was either extremely brave or incredibly foolhardy--maybe a little bit of both--to take on the unenviable task of adapting Alan Moore's and Dave Gibbon's Watchmen to the screen. Many people--including Moore himself--considered the source material impossible to transfer to film, and after viewing this well-intentioned, mostly faithful, but emotionally flat version of the graphic novel, I'm convinced that they were right.<br/><br/>Still, it's not all bad. Snyder, cinematographer Larry Fong, and their teams give us a visually rich feast that fully realizes the world of the graphic novel... and then some. The acting is, for the most part, top notch, with Jack Earle Haley's Rorschach and Jeff Morgan as the Comedian being the stand outs. Everyone else carries their roles well, with the exception of Malin Ackerman, who while easy on the eyes doesn't bring enough emotional depth to her role as Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II.<br/><br/>And to me, it's that same lack of emotional heft which is the main problem with this film. Snyder et al attempt to be as faithful to the graphic novel as they can, but inevitably they have to leave some things--actually, a lot of things--out. By packing the film full of all the characters of the source material, they do justice to none of them, leaving their stories feeling shallow.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm not some fan-boy decrying the loss of his favourite scene from the comic, like those who criticized the Lord of the Rings movies for leaving out Tom Bombadil. It's just that all the characters' stories feel rushed; even if I hadn't read the original material I would have sensed that there was a lot, too much in fact, that we weren't being shown. We don't see enough of Dan's and Laurie's relationship developing; we don't get to see enough of Rorschach's past, nor the growing horror of his therapist as he's slowly dragged into the vigilante's world; we don't see enough of Dr. Manhattan's gradual disconnect from the world and the people in it; we don't see enough of Laurie's repugnance for the Comedian. As a result, I felt interested but unmoved as events in the film transpired. I wasn't bored, as Watchmen is almost always visually intriguing, but I never felt emotionally involved.<br/><br/>Ironically, it's when Watchmen strays from its source material that it's at its best. For example, the best action sequence in the film was when Silk Spectre II and Night Owl II take on several prisoners during a riot--a scene that doesn't occur in the comic, not to that extent. Also, in the film, Hollis Mason, the original Night Owl, goes down fighting (a scene which I think was added for the DVD version), which is true to and evocative of his past as a masked adventurer, making his death all the more affecting, because he's not just fighting a group of thugs, he's combating an enemy he can never defeat: old age. And the film's ending achieved something I would not have thought possible: it improved on Alan Moore's original finale. Watchmen's concluding plot twist is a logical outcome from all that transpired before it, and it seems like it would have been more believable than the graphic novel's mock alien invasion.<br/><br/>However, without a proper investment and anchor in the lives of the underdeveloped characters, the ending, as good as it is, leaves one feeling flat and unmoved. There were too many characters for us to get to know, so we don't really get to know any of them; as a result, we don't feel deeply about what happens to any of them. I mentioned above that Watchmen is often at its best when it departs from the original. Perhaps it fails because it didn't do this often enough. Perhaps Snyder should have been even braver and focused on a smaller number of characters and fewer plot points. The result would not have been as true to the graphic novel, but it probably would have been a better movie."

","This is the movie that made me realize that regardless of how much you stress your opinion about something on other people, and whatever fancy words or metaphors you use, whether they will share your opinion about said thing depends entirely upon them: their preferences, personality, and intelligence.<br/><br/>Watchmen is like Fight Club, Memento, the recent District 9, and 2001. You either think it's weird, boring, or disappointing and hate it. Or you find it fascinating, ingenious, and extremely misunderstood.<br/><br/>I fell into the latter category. I didn't think much of it the first time I saw it, but the second time, when I watched it with my brother who explained to me some of its many allusions and metaphors, I was speechless.<br/><br/>The image of the blood drop falling on the Comedian's badge suddenly became my favorite image from any movie. Rorshach's death now makes me cry like a baby and Dr. Manhattan's speech on Mars about miracles is the most brilliant thing I've heard in a film, ever.<br/><br/>Yes, Watchmen is the best movie I've ever seen, but it's also proof that no movie, regardless of how incredible you find it to be, will ever be able to please everybody. People will always have their differing opinions, and we should all just accept that and quit arguing about it ""cough, Avatar, cough""."

It didn't capture my attention.<br/><br/>Unlike 300, this movie lacked charisma, stunning visuals (300's was eerily surrealistic) a coherent plot, and characters you care about.<br/><br/>The story begins when one of the ""superheros"", the Comedian is killed.<br/><br/>Some superhero, the guy is a rapist, he also shoots down in cold blood another pregnant woman carrying his child....and in the midst of all this and other mindless violence, we're treated to the philosophical ramblings of a big blue genie, who, starts out wearing a thong, and then goes down to nothing; stark naked! The point of this escapes me. Since I haven't read the comic, I don't know whether this is the way the character is. At any rate, if titillation was the goal, then give equal time and have Carla Gugino go in the buff.<br/><br/>Am I supposed to take the guy seriously??? Oddly, Dr. Manhattan (the blue guy), reminded me a lot of Data from Start Trek TNG in his facial expressions and voice.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really don't know what the filmmakers were shooting for with this.

"flozone","9","2","6","18 August 2009"," Great adaptation
","If there is a problem with Watchmen it is that people unfamiliar with the original novel will expect a superhero story. Watchmen is almost an anti-superhero story and if you are expecting something similar to Superman, X-Men or Fantastic Four you will likely be both confused and disappointed. The whole idea of Watchmen is much too epic to get across in less than three hours.<br/><br/>For starters, the ""superheroes"" do not have any superpowers, except for doctor Manhattan. Night Owl is wealthy from his inheritance so he can afford some nice toys like Batman, but apart from that the so called heroes are real human beings with flaws and sometimes questionable motives for putting on a costume at night and going out to beat up the ""bad guys"". Unlike regular cartoon heroes they do not all have full confidence in their own judgment and neither does anybody else, except for Rorschach making him the main driving force in the plot. Like a psychological dissection, they all have different aspects of a superhero character.<br/><br/>It all takes place in a nightmarish version of the 20th century where right-wing politicians like Nixon can be elected for five consecutive terms, gangs roam the streets and the population is in a bad state of cold-war paranoia.<br/><br/>Alan Moore has crafted a brilliantly complex plot featuring psychologically deep characters in a world that mirrors the darker parts of human nature. Both the Comedian and Rorschach understand just how dark that can be, but naturally only the Comedian sees the humour of it. Translating this depth to a feature film is almost impossible as has been predicted, however Zack Snyder has succeeded surprisingly well and has kept very close to the original storyline and graphical style.<br/><br/>The acting is very good for the most part, Rorschach and Night Owl are acted with great respect for the characters in the novel and really come to life. I was slightly disappointed in Ozymandias, not because of the acting, but I believe the actor himself could have been better chosen since he does not have the physique or charisma of Ozymandias in the novel. Other than that it was impossible to develop the characters any better.<br/><br/>The ending was the only major alteration but it does not alter the outcome much and was needed not to over complicate the climax.<br/><br/>I will probably watch Watchmen again and enjoy it more with each viewing. It is not for those who want an action packed battle between good and evil because this if far from it, but if you enjoy depth and realism then it could be a very enjoyable two hours and forty minutes. It probably helps a lot to read the book first to get a better understanding of the Watchmen universe but it isn't necessary, although I would highly recommend it in any case!"
"i-am-not-an-emo","10","2","6","14 August 2009"," One of the best films of all times.
","As I sat down at my PC, Watchmen disk in hand, I was a little apprehensive towards it as it had scored roundabout 7 on IMDb. After watching the film however I begged to differ. The general plot matching in creativity only to that of another of my recently viewed films, 'Changeling'. My utmost thanks go to the writer of the original comic books, Alan Moore, to the artist of the original comic books, Dave Gibbons and to the colourist, John Higgins for making this film a possibility.<br/><br/>The film was, in many respects, similar to The Dark Knight in the sense that it is a dark thriller about superheroes. It could also be compared to films like The Matrix. However not only is that an abominable understatement but if you are put off by the previous comments, then please reconsider as this is most definitely not your average superhero flick. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around a group of Heroes loved by the public for their undying efforts to help the police. When, however they start to fall apart for reasons which become clear, a new generation of heroes take over. The new Watchmen fight in much the same way as the previous generation but find themselves amongst a traitor whose morals are not only slightly misunderstood but which aspire to have the best intentions. I wish not to delve too deeply into the twists and turns of the plot as that would defeat the point of watching. <br/><br/>The outstanding succession of this film (in my view), is highly surprising as many a director have tried to create the perfect 'superhero movie' but have failed in futile attempts at shoddy stories and poor attempts at recreating classics. This film however uses set, lighting, costumes, CGI and of course actors to their absolute full potential. Whilst using classic special effects such as fire some more modern techniques are put into play. Effects such as the excellent use of 'slow-motion', work brilliantly in this title. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is absolutely one to go down into the 'Superhero Successes' pile. The combination of unrivalled special effects, kick-ass fight scenes, brilliant acting and a fantastic plot, make this film into a must see for anyone (who can cope with some rather stomach-turning gore) and who like action/thrillers and who, upon seeing a very cleverly placed setup to kill a villain think to themselves ""God damn. That was FRICKIN' AWESOME"". I rate this film without a shadow of a doubt a 10 out of 10. <br/><br/>I hope you enjoy watching this film as much as I did and if you have anything you disagree with or especially like then e-mail me at i.am.not.an.emo@live.com <br/><br/>Thank You."
"AlecBaldwin","10","2","6","23 July 2009"," The Mythology is Translated with Elegant Perfection
","Notorious for its 24 year, serpentine path to the big screen, Watchmen has finally, and definitively been realized as the astonishingly complex piece it was originally conceived as. There is elegance in the moral ambiguity of the source material, and it would have been a desecration to forgo this in order to bring yet another cardboard ""Comic Book"" film to the theaters (e.g. The Fantastic Four, The X-Men, last two Spiderman films, etc.). The Watchmen was never a comic book, but a deconstruction of the superhero mythology. Deconstruction is not just a fancy term for ""things are gonna explode"", movie patrons. Jerry Bruckheimer's name is not attached to this film. This is brilliance.<br/><br/>With no shortage of thrills the action, like that in ""The Dark Knight"", has a point. It is reassuring that a director understands the difference between pyrotechnics and plot. The Blu- Ray Director's cut provides extra footage which enhances the story for the uninitiated. <br/><br/>And for the record, Jackie Earle Haley defines the role of conflicted freak as only Heath Ledger had before."
"ZekeRage911","4","2","6","2 July 2009"," Zack Snyder is a 13 year old boy
","I held off on watching Watchmen for a long time. This is Alan Moore's epic, and you'd think that having a storyboard already worked out for you would help even a hack like Snyder get it right. With three hours to work with, even this complicated epic should be able to be competently told.<br/><br/>The first five minutes included an unnecessary fight scene. Then there was the opening title that went on forever with a song that served to insult the intelligence of anyone over fourteen years old. The soundtrack is hideous, completely failing to capture the mood of any scene. Scenes that should have been subtle and understated were overblown and expanded. Scenes that were expanded and intense were shortened and robbed of depth.<br/><br/>The rape scene was extended for no visible purpose other than, apparently, to beat a woman up. The single coolest moment in Rorschach's history was changed to be more brutal, and less intelligent. In the first two hours of this movie, a full forty minutes could have been cut and nothing would have been lost.<br/><br/>Too much emphasis was put on sex, gore, visual effects, 'cool' shots, and insulting our intelligence with extra scenes and back story that changed a LOT of the characters motivations. Important lines and scenes were left out.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 4 out of ten for at least getting the basic story right, and giving good visuals to some scenes that actually do make an impact. But overall... don't watch the Watchmen. Read the graphic novel. Ironically... it's less graphic. But it has a better ending."
"ozymandiaskingofkings","9","2","6","1 July 2009"," A different sort of superhero film
","To say that Watchmen is a film that I have anticipated for a long time would be a bit of an understatement. I, like many others, am an enormous fan of the graphic novel and was extremely conflicted about the prospect of a big screen adaptation: excited about it finally happening and deeply worried that whichever director eventually got the gig would screw it up.<br/><br/>There were two main concerns about the adaptation: that it would miss a lot of detail out that was in the novel and that some of the roles had been miscast. Neither of these are true, and in terms of transplanting the novel to the screen it's brilliant, very faithful, visually perfect and clearly the work of someone who respects the material as much as I do. There are a few niggles which I will come to in a while, but mostly everything is almost spot on.<br/><br/>For those who have been living in a cave for the last year, Watchmen is set in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is still president, the world is on the brink of thermonuclear war and costumed heroes have been outlawed. When one of these heroes The Comedian is outlawed, Rorschach (who refused to turn himself in) contacts his former colleagues and they begin investigating the murder, stumbling upon a vast conspiracy to assassinate former heroes in the process .<br/><br/>The main thing that should be stressed is that the central performances are, on the whole, excellent. Jack Earl Haley is an absolute revelation as Rorschach, a psychopathic vigilante with a warped sense of absolutist morality. He's practically Travis Bickle in a mask, complete with bitter misanthropic voice-over and misplaced sense of nobility. Also especially excellent is Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, an amoral mercenary who had been employed by the government to carry out black ops. Imagine if Captain America was a symbol not of freedom, but of American imperialism and you're halfway there. The Comedian is in theory a totally reprehensible character, selfish, violent, sexist etc, so it is a tribute to Morgan that he ultimately becomes sympathetic.<br/><br/>Rounding out the Crimebusters are Nite Owl, Silk Spectre and Ozymandias. Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl is doomed to be overshadowed by the larger characters played by Morgan and Haley, but deserves just as much recognition as the other two. He really nails the character of Dan Dryberg, a nerdy, slightly overweight loser who longs to be a hero again. Dryberg is much more Clark Kent than superman, a slightly awkward, but noble character, who is probably the only character in the film who comes across as both normal and likable.<br/><br/>Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre is regrettably the weakest link. She's very attractive and looks great in the costume, but she's not a very good actress and doesn't really convince on any of her line readings. Also, in the key emotional scenes where Carla Gugino plays her mother (the first Slik Spectre) she isn't very believable and all you think is that Gugino is a much better actress.<br/><br/>Finally, we have Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, in many ways the hardest of the characters to portray as he is meant to be basically perfect: hyper intelligent, very athletic and confident without being arrogant. Goode's casting was widely criticised before the film was released but to be honest, he does a pretty fine job. He definitely looks the part, and while I don't necessarily agree with his affected accent or quite how aloof he portrayed Adrian, it is to his credit that I still felt I was watching the character rather than an actor and if anything, my frustration was that there weren't enough scenes to properly establish Veidt as there could have been.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning, and is very close to the graphic novel bringing all the stunning aspects (Manhatten's crystal Mars palace, Karnak, the Comedian's death) to life. The sets, direction and cinematography are all wonderful realisations of Gibbon's artwork while the action sequences are actually in many cases better than the book, especially the assassination of The Comedian, the attempted hit on Ozymandias and the whole last act in Karnak.<br/><br/>But by far the best part of the film is the opening credits. Now, I know that sounds like an insult, but it isn't, as Snyder presents us with a visual history of superheroes in the watchmen universe from the foundation of the first heroes in 1940 to 1985 when the story takes place. This sequence is a montage of beautiful slow motion images that are almost like moving photographs, a shimmering 50s style gleam standing against the darkness of what the images actually mean, all scored to Dylan's ""the times they are a-changing"". It's a brilliant combination of myth and history and condenses almost all the novels back-story fantastically, which allows the rest of the film to concentrate on the main plot without interruption or digression.<br/><br/>So, what are the problems with Watchmen? Well, the main one was actually prophesied by Alan Moore. Whereas in the comic you could flip back to a previous page if you were confused about something, the film is pretty fast moving and while those who have read the book will have no problem following the labyrinthine plot, newbies to Watchmen may be confused, especially about some of the things on the periphery which aren't really explained, such as why the heroes were outlawed and the nature of Bubastis (Ozymandias' genetically engineered pet lynx). The first 3/4 are pretty much perfect, but the end is handled a little too quickly and is potentially confusing.<br/><br/>Overall though, it's a very faithful, fantastically realised adaptation of an incredible novel. If you are a fan anyway, you'll probably love it. If not, still an amazing experience, but probably worth investing in the novel too.<br/><br/>I really look forward to the extended cut on DVD."

","A great action graphic novel (by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons) brought to film by Zack Snyder (also directed 300). Oh and for the record, yes this movie is indeed graphic, from protruding bones to well, you'll just have to watch to see what else is showing. Now I know this movie is been for what seems like a while and I actually watched it when it first came out (Midnight, CST), but the first time I was pretty caught up in the action and other graphic scenes, and may have missed some of the dialogue, but the running commentary coming from my right. This, by the way, was OK because I was able to have addition details to fill in some gaps without having to read the actual novel, WOO! Watching Watchmen, (to me), was just as entertaining as watching Iron Man and The Dark Knight, it showed people using their talents in a ""constructive"" manner, while humanizing them (unlike Superman, a good superhero, but unrealistic) with good days and bad days. So enjoy the movie, if you feeling a little squeamish, just rememberÂ…it's only a movie and that goes the same for those wishing their man was just a little bigger."

","""Watchmen"" is a graphic-novel-turned-movie about a group of superheroes who are outlawed by society. And then after one of them is killed, they must band together to earn their place in society when a war is on the brink.<br/><br/>Overall, this was incredibly disappointing. It was too long, and there were sequences that were really unnecessary; sexual sequences. Now, I know that this is rated R, but still, ""Watchmen"" could've been fine with out all of the sex. Also, I didn't feel much of an emotional connection with the characters, save Rorshach and Dr. Manhattan. Also, one other character I liked less and less was the Comedian. After seeing all of the things that he did to women, I just thought, ""Am I supposed to like him?"" I don't recommend this to people."
"captelephant","8","2","6","19 March 2009"," Too close to the comic for its own good
","THE GOOD: Watchmen does 90% of everything it tries right. It's beautiful, intelligent, well-acted and beautiful again. Rorschach is AMAZING and Dr. Manhatten is spot on. Most of the dialog, often word-for-word from the comic (yes, sorry, graphic novel), is razor sharp, and the plot, while imperfect, is still head and shoulders above the norm.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the 10% it does wrong is probably the stuff that will stick with you.<br/><br/>THE BAD: I respect Snyder for his determination to follow the comic to the letter, I really do, but he has to learn when to step back and let a movie stand on its own feet. For example: the story could and should have been restructured to avoid the cluster-bomb of flashbacks crammed into the first hour. And Bubastis seriously had to go.<br/><br/>Then there's the terrible, embarrassing-to-the-point-of-movie-damaging porno scene dead smack in the middle. Why!? If there was ONE place to stick with the comic (where this scene is short and tasteful) this was it.<br/><br/>Finally, the sound track is distracting. It's not that the songs are bad, but the placement, volume and arrangement of said songs makes it all too clear that many are only here for commercial tie-ins. There are of course exceptions (loved the intro and the comedian's funeral).<br/><br/>Overall Watchmen is an achievement in many ways. It's not perfect (nor was the comic to be honest), but it's damn good. Highly recommended."
"ryan-1438","6","2","6","19 March 2009"," Left the Cinema So Disappointed!
","Firstly, what everyone needs to do is to stop comparing this to the graphic novel, as Zack Snyder said himself this film was more for people who hadn't read the novel rather than those who had. I myself haven't read the novel yet, i was going to but opted to see the film first so that my experience wasn't tainted by trying to refer back to the novel as others have done. So i feel i can write an unbiased review based solely on the film! Here are a few points of where i felt the film went wrong! The film never shows the watchmen as the watchmen, except for the group picture, the film never shows you the watchmen at their height working together fighting crime and subsequently doesn't show why the people turned on the them? The tag-lines of 'who watches the watchmen' really intrigued me and it was something that wasn't explored.<br/><br/>Every scene lacked emotion, when New York was destroyed and 15 million people died i didn't care, when Rosarch was splattered all over the snow i didn't care, when Night Owl and the Silk Spectre where getting it on i didn't care, when Dr Manhattan retreated to mars i didn't care and when America reached Deafcon 1 and Nixon was about to destroy the world i actually couldn't have cared less. It was all done so nonchalant, it seemed as if there was more emphasis and attention paid to the unimportant parts of the film rather than the bigger picture. When spectre and Manhattan are on mars and the camera pulls away to reveal a smiley face i thought surely this cant be the end but then again i actually don't really care! The movie is slow and sluggish, painfully moving from one scene to another, for a 2 1/2 hour film they crammed it full of unnecessary crap and left out explaining or elaborating on certain parts of the story.<br/><br/>For a film that was meant to reflect the emotional turmoil and darkness thats in us all and at the end of the day these superheroes where just human i felt that the film lacked any depth whatsoever.<br/><br/>The plot was so linear and the SHOCKER that ozymandias was in fact a villain failed to keep me from nodding off never mind keep me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>I was so looking forward to this film i watched the trailer a dozen times and read all i could about it on the net. In the end i was left very disappointed, i thought it was going to be a film to rival the dark knight but it just isn't, cinematography wise it ticks all the boxes but in terms of the plot, character building and emotion it fails miserably."
"sijones","5","2","6","12 March 2009"," This superhero film is as flawed as its characters
","Watchmen takes place in an alternate reality version of 1985 in which superheroes not only exist, but have also changed the course of American history. However, superheroes have been outlawed due to the fact that they have caused more problems than they solved. After the murder of a vigilante known as The Comedian, a group of retired superheroes try to unravel the mystery while simultaneously dealing with their own personal baggage.<br/><br/>At least this is what the marketing campaign would have us believe. In truth, the majority of the characters in Watchmen have all the depth of the average soap opera caricature, and their problems and psychology behind their motives ignored for the most part. A passing mention is given to how Laury Jupiter was forced into becoming a costumed adventurer by her mother, Dan Dreiberg's costume fetish is barley alluded to, and Rorschach's origin story fails to fully explain exactly why he chose to don his inkblot mask in the first place. The character who gets the biggest blue shaft is Adrian Vedit, a superhero turned industrial tycoon. He plays a very pivotal role in the film, but he is given a criminally small amount of screen time, and what little of the film he is in doesn't flesh him out satisfactorily.<br/><br/>The major problem most of the characters confront is that they are written about as consistently as a bowl of grits. For instance, it's established at one point that The Comedian's mind was broken at one point, but in a scene which chronologically follows the incident, he is in charge of himself. Laury also suffers from this; it is established that she distastes the whole crime-fighting thing, but she acts enthusiastic about engaging in violence almost to the point of blood-lust. At one point she brutally murders a gang member with all the remorse of a sociopath (an impression that is not dissuaded by the actress' deadpan performance).<br/><br/>Zack Snyder keeps reminding us that Watchmen is not meant for youths, but his methods end up backfiring on the film. Rather than focusing more on mature themes and telling a good story, Snyder constantly shoves wanton sex and bloody violence in the audience's face. For instance, the action scenes present in Watchmen are so gorily cartoon-like and ludicrously over the top that I kept expecting to see words like PAIN!, SNAP!, and DEATH! typed across the screen like some perverted tribute to Adam West. The gratuitous prolonged shots of a sex scene are also bungled. What should be a moving scene comes across as a parody of really bad porno set to Hallelujah. In the end, it is made clear that kids have no business seeing this film, but it also feels far too immature.<br/><br/>Acting performances are mostly average all around, except for the woman playing Sally Jupiter. The only way to account for her hammy performance is to assume that after hearing that he wouldn't be in the new Star Trek film, William Shatner dressed in drag and covered himself up in some of the most hilariously bad makeup (almost outdoing a laughable Richard Nixon with a nose that will fuel phallic jokes for years to come) to get some work. Billy Crudup's performance as Doctor Manhattan is good, but the choice of Snyder to have him act slightly emotional doesn't fit with his image of being detached from humanity as dictated by his dialogue. The only actor who gives a consistently good performance is Jackie Earl Haley as the uncompromising sociopath Rorschach. Everything about him is terrifying, down to his maddeningly broken monotone.<br/><br/>With all that said, Watchmen isn't devoid of merit. Some of the dramatic moments are amazingly moving, and the visual design of the world of Watchmen is gorgeous. OK, it looks like all of the exterior scenes were shot on a sound stage in front of a green screen, but the film never feels as fake as 300, and even when the scenery isn't technically strong, the sheer artistry prevails. There is one glaring flaw that nothing that all the artistry and imagination in the whole film can't begin to make up for: the music. Don't get me wrong, I love 99 Luftballons as much as the next guy, but the soundtrack feels like it was done by having someone pull random songs out a hat, and most of them turn their respective scenes into unintentional comedies. The film's creative opening credits are full of somber scenes that clash abysmally with Bob Dylan's Times Are a Changing (one scene showing a man in a moth suite being committed in slow-mo elicited the most jeers from the audience I was with).<br/><br/>Despite all the flaws I saw, I liked Watchmen. Sure, the narrative is so disjointed it risks losing the audience and Snyder's direction has all the subtlety of HIRED!, but the film kept me interested until the end. Sadly, it was at this point that the script jumped the shark with in a way so bad it would make George ""Fridge-Nuker"" Lucas cry. It's hard to explain just how unbelievably dumb the end is without spoiling the film, but all I will say is that anyone in the government with half a brain could easily uncover the plot (no 'military intelligence' jokes, please), and even assuming that the no one ever did figure out the Scooby-Doo plot, the aftermath is less convincing than an issue of World Weekly News.<br/><br/>All in all, Watchmen is not a good film, but nor is it a bad film. Its heart is in the right place, and the film is fairly stunning to look at, but Zack Snyder's inability to direct actors or interest in telling a well structured story ultimately sink the film. If you really feel the urge to see Watchmen as soon as possible, you might want to catch a matinÃ©e, but everyone else is better of renting it."
"Travixius","10","2","6","11 March 2009"," Superb... but only for certain sensibilities.
","It is true that what you take with you into a cinema is more often than not what you take out. This is absolutely the case for Watchmen. Not since perhaps Bladerunner or even The Matrix has a film bisected audiences so cleanly. The spectrum of opinion on Zack Snyder's Watchmen seems incomprehensively wide and weighted at both ends, even among Science Fantasy lovers and casual viewers. I first read what they now call the graphic novel in 2004. Since that time I have revisited it possibly 3 or 4 times. It remains among the top 5 of my favourite works of literature ever and certainly the best comic. After obsessively reading dozens of reviews I thought I knew what to expect but I was not prepared for what I was about to see and hear. Watchmen is a superb piece of film, lovingly realized and faithfully translated to the screen by people who care deeply not only for the written and drawn material, but for the emotion that it has evoked over the last 24 years. I had read some reviews that suggested the dialogue, visuals and storytelling overall deviated considerably from Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's work, but the truth is the film could not be a more faithful adaptation if the actors were dripping with ink from a printing press. Yes, costumes have been changed, but the overhaul was necessary, as with Batman in Nolan's films or Iron Man. Yes there were changes to dialogue and minor details omitted and added, but they served to streamline Alan Moore's multi layered narrative into the linear structure of film. Pacing and dialogue mirrored the comic to over 90 percent. As far as making you feel you were in the Watchmen universe, the film did not miss a beat. The look, feel and sound of the 80s was palpable to the point of smelling the era. The acting ranged from more than adequate performances to flashes of brilliance. Case in point, Jack Earle Haley who turns in a performance nobody could deny is at least as strong as Heath Ledger in that Batman movie people seem to be partial to. He inhabits Rorschach so completely, that you walk out just a little more cynical about life than you were when you sat down. I enjoyed Patrick Wilson's measured performance as Nite Owl, and Malin Ackerman who certainly looked the part as Laurie did a good job. The negative comments about her performance in reviews are not warranted. Visually there is no faulting the film. From the rain soaked angel statue at the Comedian's funeral to the pan out of his badge on the street, it's a feast served up straight from the pages by Gibbons. The score and soundtrack to the film are for me a gamble that paid off. It goes a long way to establishing that the story is a decade transcending piece, and often juxtaposes what we are seeing, a clever choice. I can never hear Unforgettable by Nat King Cole again and not think of The Comedian and that window. Now lets discuss that changed ending which has so polarised filmgoers. It works, not as a substitution but as a remedy. Ponder it afterwards and you may just conclude it's an improvement. So far I have been discussing this as a Watchmen fan but let's talk about the artistry of the film. Like the aforementioned Blade Runner the film has it's own unique signature, certainly the first two thirds of the film. It has a foreboding noir edge I have not seen in a while which will win over some not intimate with comics. However the uncompromising violence which does not occur as often as you might guess will turn some off, as will the unrestrained sexuality. I also believe the opening montage, which encompasses Watchmen's end issue extras and delves deep into backstory, will throw those unfamiliar from the start, although it's beautifully executed. It was a bold endeavor to put to film but ultimately, it is a triumph that will be misunderstood and hated for the wrong reasons by many, and for perfectly valid reasons by the more astute, yet one cannot deny it is a masterpiece of modern film craft technically and visually. Superb. The wait for the extended cut later in the year will be very gruelling indeed."
"javaman-7","9","2","6","10 March 2009"," Watching The Watchmen at Midnight in Lakewood, Ohio.
","Java Man Reviews ""The Watchmen."" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com March, 2009.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>The year is a nightmare version of 1985 with Richard Nixon in his fifth term as President. The era of the superheroes (which started in 1940, as sort of costume club) is coming to an end. Nixon has used the awesome power of Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Crudup) to subdue the Viet Cong, and is now riding high as the world's most powerful man. But the superheroes begin to disappear one by one, starting with the amusingly cynical Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Is Tricky Dick behind this conspiracy too? All of the events are being recorded in the journal of Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), whose mask is a constantly shifting pattern of blotches.<br/><br/>A tender love story emerges between Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), each of whom has the romantic notion that they can make the world a better place. Silk Specter I (Carla Gugino) is II's shrewish mom. The other superhero who figures in the plot is Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), whose power is that he is ""the smartest man in the world."" (And I always thought that was Henry Kissinger, who, incidentally, is still Secretary of State).<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java Mugs <br/><br/>This film opened Friday, March 6, 2009, and The Detroit Theatre in Lakewood was one of the first to show it with a screening at midnight. When I heard that Richard Nixon was in this movie, and that he was still president in 1985, I thought it must be a horror flick. Actually, it is a very engaging adaptation of a graphic novel, complete with complex superheroes, a captivating plot and a fascinating collection of real-life pop icons (such as Ted Koppel, Truman Capote, Mick Jagger and Andy Warhol, in addition to Nixon and Kissinger).<br/><br/>Probably the most intriguing of the superheroes is Haley's Rorschach who is investigating the disappearances and recording everything in his journal. He's even better when he takes off his mask. Just the opposite is true of Nite Owl and Silk Spectre II, who only captivate when in costume. Other watchable characters are Crudup's Dr. Manhattan and Gugino's Silk Spectre I.<br/><br/>Though the film is long and the narrative a bit rambling, it never gets boring. The special effects and computer wizardry are excellent, but the film doesn't lean on them too heavily; something is happening all the time, and most of it is character driven. Everything looks just right, too, from the epic depiction of the planet of Mars to the small detail of the over-sized eyeglasses everyone used to wear in the '80s.<br/><br/>While most of the action takes place in 1985, the filmmakers have made the surprisingly effective choice to comment on the action by way of songs from the '60s, including key classics from the songbooks of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Paul Simon.<br/><br/>As I stroll home after the bars have closed, I look forward to more midnight showings at the Detroit Theatre."
"ronniej962","9","2","6","10 March 2009"," Worth The Wait
","I've never been a big comic book reader but always enjoy superhero movies regardless of whether I'm familiar with the superhero or not. As technology improves and advances, so has the story lines surrounding the lives of the superhero. Overall, this movie did not disappoint me. There could have been more crime fighting than explaining the history of crime fighting. I didn't think the movie was for kids obviously as the MPAA didn't think so either by the R rating. If you've seen the movie Sin City, then you should have an idea of the types of scenes that could be shown in this movie and trust me, there was no deviation from that style.<br/><br/>I have a thing for slow motion scenes in movies and think that was the greatest discovery since sliced bread. There were plenty of slow motion scenes that captured the action the way I love to see it. I know there are just as many ""thumbs down"" as there are ""thumbs up"" which part of the problem, from what I understand, is related to the connection of the movie to the comic book. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not a big comic book fan and therefore cannot relate the movie back to that source. I only had to rely on the storyline to entertain me and I was truly entertained. As I'm sure you are aware, the movie is very, very long and some parts where it gets into the history of some of the crime fighters can be a bit challenging if you haven't had your Wheaties. That doesn't take away from the movie; it just means that you have to pay attention to what's being said so that you can understand the psyche of some of the characters.<br/><br/>I didn't want to give any parts of the movie away so I kept it brief. I think this movie is worth the almost 3 hours of downtime it takes. I'm sure you'll be entertained to some degree. So, bring an extra $15 to buy yourself a large bag of pop corn and a large drink and set back and enjoy."
"formicidae","9","2","6","10 March 2009"," Watchmen delivers
","I can understand why Alan Moore wouldn't want his name attached to Zack Snyder's Watchmen. His original material is more nuanced, complex, and, well, just original, and probably can't ever be replicated in another medium as well. But man, if ever an effort was to be made, this version of Watchmen is as good as it's going to get. It doesn't pull punches, doesn't sugarcoat or shrink away from what Moore imagines, and while some details are left out, far more was left in than I expected. Kudos for everyone involved in this movie. I can't describe what a joy it is to see a movie that doesn't talk down to its audience, and isn't, unlike adaptations of fellow graphic artist Frank Miller's work, just about men behaving badly. Watchmen is a beautiful, thought-provoking piece of work, deserving of the name."
"collector256","9","2","6","10 March 2009"," Cant get much closer to the book
","Since I read the book first its hard not to review the movie without comparing it to how close it was to the original. So I'm not sure how I would review it had I never read it. The book did not blow me away when I read it, but I thought the murder-mystery story was interesting and had some cool characters and an original spin on the lives of comic book heroes. Just seeing things like the comedians death, owl ship and Dr. Manhattan brought to life almost exactly like the book was pretty amazing. I am glad they went with unknown actors so audiences do not focus on what star is in the role and take away from the believability of the characters. For the most part the actors were convincing, especially Rorschach, with the voice and visual effects ended up being way cooler than what I would have thought. The films visual effects were top notch which made me wonder why they didn't spend as much time on the horrible Nixon makeup. Aside from the Minutemen, the costumes were made to look a little more modern and I believe the change was good, since the original designs were a little ridiculous looking even for the time period. As for the music, I personally am not a fan of folksy protest songs that made up a large part of the soundtrack, but I guess they were appropriate for the mood the director wanted to set for what was going on at the time. I also feel the movie should have been NC 17 with a lot of unnecessary nudity and very brutal violence which was in the book, but not to that extent. To me the ending explanation was more believable than the space squid, which just would have been silly looking after going through this serious story line for 2.5 hrs. The director said he wanted to make this movie before someone ruined it and by pretty much copying the look & dialog of the book word for word this really cant get any closer."

"eastbergholt2002","9","2","6","9 March 2009"," Great Movie
","The movie looks great and has excellent production values. It's an ensemble piece, with no main central character. The Watchmen are a band of superheroes who live in a violent and corrupt alternative 1980s universe. The film starts with an explanation of the bizarre world in which the story is set. A retired superhero called the Comedian is murdered. A former colleague, Rorschach, investigates his death. The back story of the main characters is explained and the plot slowly unravels. The film takes a while to get going, but it's worth the wait.<br/><br/>The Watchmen as a group are flawed but fascinating. Some of them are not much better than the bad guys they are trying to stop. Having grown up reading Marvel and DC comics in my pre-teen years, I found the Watchmen strangely compelling and more complex and interesting than any superhero movie I had seen recently. Batman and Spiderman seem like angst-ridden teenagers when compared to the characters in the Watchman.<br/><br/>The film has intellectual pretensions and poses some interesting philosophical questions. The acting is superb and Malin Akerman is very hot as Silk Spectre. It's a film that sticks in your mind and I'm looking forward to watching it again. Highly recommended."
"Michael Fargo","4","2","6","9 March 2009"," Stink-oh
","Right now, the only graphic novel that's made it successfully to the screen--for me--is ""Road to Perdition."" ""Watchmen"" has very little energy and that's reserved for the soundtrack. Visually, it's dull and cheesy with action sequences so derivative that they pass without notice.<br/><br/>The plot is one of those things you do sitting around when you're stoned and you think it's all funny and relevant and really smart. The next morning, you replay the tape recorder and you wonder what you were thinking. Oh, you forgot, you were loaded.<br/><br/>I sat there wondering, ""What the hell are these people talking about?"" The make-up is so retrograde that I wondered why did they even bother to make someone ""kinda"" look like Richard Nixon.<br/><br/>Whatever this is, I wished I would have skipped it. Even the Imax format didn't jazz it up any."
"socrates99","9","2","6","9 March 2009"," Not my favorite movie - but way up there
","The opening credits are pure gold and probably the best ever, in my opinion. But it's a shame to have to say this as it means the rest of the movie isn't quite as spectacular. But it's still a level higher than anything else out there though light and breezy it's not. In fact in some ways it may be the darkest movie I've ever seen. Even darker than Sin City mostly because of the way Sin City was realized in black and white. This on the other hand is a real action movie for the most part. Only Billy Crudup's somewhat distracting but still quite well done Dr. Manhatten is always CGI though the action itself is often digitally enhanced. My favorite superheroes were The Comedian, Rorschach, and Ozymandias though Nite Owl II and Silver Spectre II were more endearing than I expected. In some ways these last two are the heart of the movie. They set the tone which is off beat and create the focal point. By its end I could see why this somewhat odd movie's underlying novel was so revered. It makes some points that few other films have made and for that I have to give it high marks."

The visuals are surrealist and impressive, and the Fox brings to life the godlike character Dr. Manhattan, mars, Vietnam. The actors (some) are fantastic jack Earle Haley shows a scary Rorschach, Jeffrey dean Morgana is perfect as The Comedian.

"MaxBorg89","9","2","6","9 March 2009"," Rorschach's journal: March 2009
","Watchmen is a film most people approach with an equal amount of excitement and fear. Excitement, because it's been wildly anticipated since 1987 and feels perfectly at home now, its themes of trust, paranoia and the true meaning of heroism being a suitable companion piece to Chris Nolan's The Dark Knight. Fear, because the original graphic novel is considered by many to be the best comic-book ever written in the English language, and given Hollywood's habit of screwing up anything created by Alan Moore (who preemptively had his name removed from the credits and swore he's never going to see the picture), there was a fairly big chance even director Zack Snyder's best intentions were overcome by studio reasoning. The truth? Watchmen is, to this day, the closest any movie has come to capturing the core of Moore's thoughts, one of the smartest comic-book movies of the decade and a visually rich blockbuster.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated (in case there are any), Watchmen takes place in a very bleak 1985: Richard Nixon is now in his fourth term, there's a constant risk of nuclear war with Russia and superheroes have been outlawed. This means the titular group no longer exists, at least on paper. Then, one night in New York, a murder is committed. The police rule it off as standard business, but a masked vigilante named Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) begs to differ: the victim was Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), aka The Comedian, the most violent of the Watchmen, and whoever offed him might be after the others. However, the others aren't that interested in Rorschach's theories: Dan ""Nite Owl"" Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) and Laurie ""Silk Spectre"" Jupiter (Nalin Akerman) are too busy catching up, Adrian ""Ozymandias"" Veidt (Matthew Goode), self-proclaimed ""smartest man on the planet"", prefers exploiting his own image and seeking alternative energy sources (okay, maybe he's got a point there), and as for the group's only real ""super"" hero, Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup), aka Dr. Manhattan (a living atomic weapon after a lab accident), well, he's so all-powerful he no longer cares about the world. But what if Rorschach's right? What if someone wants to destroy the world and is making sure no one gets in the way? As Bob Dylan says during the beautiful opening montage, the times they are a-changin'...<br/><br/>Watchmen was, ad is, a lot more than a comic-book: it's a mixture of poetry, politics, visuals, sex, violence, psychoanalysis and much, much more. Like all of Moore's work, what matters the most is the subtext and symbolism, starting with names like Rorschach (the famous test), Ozymandias (a poem by Shelley and, like the quote by Juvenal which gave the graphic novel its title, a warning against the abuse of power) or Dr. Manhattan (Project Manhattan is what led to the creation of the nuclear bomb). In a way, Watchmen was also a reflection on the superhero genre in itself, and Snyder retains some of that aspect as well, most notably the multiple generations subplot (the current Silk Spectre is the original's daughter) and the significance of the costumes (in Nite Owl's case, it's a substitute for Viagra). Of course, he couldn't include everything in a 160-minute feature, but the key story is left intact (save for the theory that two of the ""heroes"" might be gay) and brought to the screen word for word.<br/><br/>The same goes for the images: using the original panels by Dave Gibbons as storyboards (and convincing Gibbons to design the one scene that differs from the graphic novel), the director repeats the miracle of 300, bringing Moore's bleak world to life the exact way it was first conceived. Even better, he has managed to dodge the problem of not including the poetry and philosophy quotations by working extra hard on the soundtrack, picking a series of defining tunes that accompany the live-action treatment of Gibbons' illustrations. The result is visually and aurally striking (exhibit A: the Dr. Manhattan-centric segment), and the main reason Watchmen works so damn well on the big screen.<br/><br/>And now, the ""but"". It's only one, but it's rather significant: although he's done a terrific job with the casting, why did Snyder insist that poor Matthew Goode, a bona fide Englishman, speak with a German accent? Sure, the character has a German-sounding name, but those speech patterns make him less charismatic as the picture progresses. Everyone else does a fine job, though, even Malin Akerman who is still best known to audiences as Ben Stiller's heinous wife in The Heartbreak Kid. Standing out - inevitably - is Haley's Rorschach, one of literature's (and cinema's) most credible psychos, a creepy yet strangely relatable vigilante who sums up the story's moral ambiguity to perfection.<br/><br/>So, is Watchmen the best comic-book adaptation ever? Of course not. Okay, but is it the movie fans and casual moviegoers alike deserve? Oh, yes. It's ambitious, complex, dark and uncompromising. And yes, it's based on the Citizen Kane of comic-books, which makes it a must-see in any case.<br/><br/>8,5/10"
"haydntarr","8","2","6","9 March 2009"," A fan written review
","After reading the comic book shortly after the film was announced, I deliberated about writing a review this soon as I would have liked to have seen it a second time. Like the many reviewers of this title; I have read the comic book, and I promised myself before watching the movie that I would try to not compare the comic and film too much whilst watching it, so I watch whilst appreciating Snyders creativeness with the characters and filming. I could compare the two versions after.<br/><br/>The movie had received a lot of negative press in the months running up to the release, one which I was upset to hear was that the film was to be an adaptation.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was what I expected; a lot had been cut out, and many scenes shortened and squashed together to shorten the film down to appease a wider audience. It would be hard to write my comments further about how the novel differs the film, as it would spoil the film immensely.<br/><br/>The first scene opened the film perfectly, with the intro credits providing a brief history of the Minutemen and the foundations of Watchmen. I was sceptic about Snyder's trade mark slow motion effects being added in, especially as this was one of the only things that I didn't enjoy too much in '300'. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see these added to 'Watchmen' nicely.<br/><br/>Haley was outstanding in this film, I hadn't seen him in any other films until now, although I've been told his performance in 'Little Children' was very good. I think the majority of the audience will find Rorshach the most likable character from the line-up. The casting was perfect, the awkwardness of Dan Driedberg was perfect, and Dr Manhattan's detachment from human civilisation was played out perfectly, in particular; the watchmaker scene.<br/><br/>Although a great film, I feel as though more could have been added to describe the history of the Minutemen a lot more, as I think a lot of people would come out wanting more. I would highly recommend reading the comic, or even reading the 'Under the hood' sections.<br/><br/>I am eagerly awaiting the directors cut, in the meantime I will just have to settle with watching it again."
"precious8387","5","2","6","9 March 2009"," Not a movie for kids or teenagers
","I was rather bored during the first half of the movie, and I was not expecting the amount of nudity that it obtained. I don't recommend that teenagers under the age 17 see this movie, as there is a pretty graphic sex scene within the movie.<br/><br/>Once the superheroes came out of hiding, I was immediately drawn in. The special effects used were awesome, especially during the mars scenes. I was pretty mesmorized during the second mars scene, when Miss Jupiter is convincing Mr. Manhattan to fight with her. I am not sure what they were flying around mars on, but it was pretty cool.<br/><br/>The costumes were very good for this movie, so the costume designer did an extremely great job.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a pretty good movie and I would recommend that you see this movie."
"johnnymacbest","10","2","6","8 March 2009"," Snyder has done the impossible and achieved it.
","What Zack Snyder (of 300 fame) has done is nothing short of amazing brilliance. He has taken one of the most iconic pieces of literature which was impossible to film, and made it possible!! He's done it and done it really well he has. Having never read the original graphic novel, I was pleasantly surprised with this film. This is one of the best films I have seen this year and I'm pleased to learn that it's one of the Top 250 movies of all time. Watchmen is truly something special with dark themes, brooding atmosphere, deep emotion and dark violence mixed with political and social commentary that bites so deeply into humanity it almost becomes a mirror image of our times;especially now with all the wars, economic collapse, violence that's prevalent in today's world. But none of this wouldn't be done without the sharp, tight direction, editing, and well-written script with beautiful performances with everyone involved.<br/><br/>With last year's The Dark Knight, lighting has struck twice for DC Comics and Warner Bros for bringing Watchmen to the big screen. It's not only a great film, it's an achievement. One that could've ended up less than the sum of it's parts but not here. Not now. Not ever. Congratulations, Mr. Snyder. You have done the impossible and achieved it. Another film worthy of praise in the same league as The Dark Knight."
"Lord_Crypto","9","2","6","8 March 2009"," All depends on how you go into this movie!
","I will make this review short and sweet cause I can sum up this movie in a short and efficient manner. You all need to know something about me. I am a huge movie fan, but first and foremost, I am a comic fan. And I am completely capable of drawing the line between comic book and film. What makes a great comic book film is its ability to keep true to its origins while transforming it to the real world. I have always been skeptical to making a Watchmen movie because I have always sided with Alan Moore on this topic. I think Watchmen delivers its most powerful effect in its true medium and that is the world of comics and not the movie industry. That being said, Watchmen is a phenomenal film for us comic fans. It sets a new bar for the phrase ""Sticking true to the comics."" However, for some people who have not read the comic, it will be filled with a lot of twists and plot turns which may make the film confusing. It may be very convoluted and dense to some. This was proved by my friends who asked many questions throughout the movie since they never read it. The costumes and dialogue may seem cheesy at times. So, if your a comic fan, you'll love it. If your a regular movie-goer, you will have mixed interpretations. But if you are a comic AND movie fan like myself who keeps the two mediums separated from one another, you will both like and dislike it at times. But nonetheless, it is a great film. Kudos to Jackie Earle Haley and his performance of Rorschach. I could not have been more pleased with this performance!"
"seawalker","8","2","6","8 March 2009"," Possibly the best adaptation that could be made
","Hollywood cannot please all of the people all of the time. Hollywood cannot please Alan Moore any of the time.<br/><br/>... And it's a real shame, because if Alan Moore had not chosen to distance himself from the movie adaptation of ""Watchmen"", and made it clear that he had no intention of seeing the movie, he would realise that ""Watchmen"" was a very good movie indeed. Possibly the best adaptation of the legendary comic book that could be made.<br/><br/>True, ""Watchmen"" wasn't perfect. The dialogue was more comic book than movie. Carla Gugino and Matthew Goode were underused. Some of the popular music cues were misplaced. (Simon and Garfunkel's ""The Sound Of Silence"" is a beautiful and evocative song, and was used well, but appeared in the wrong time period in the movie. Compare and contrast with the perfect use of Dylan's ""The Time's They Are A Changing"" over the opening credits.) There was a tad overuse of slow motion action sequences. Some of the density of information of the original book was missing. (Then again, to have fitted it all in, how long would that movie have had to be?)<br/><br/>When ""Watchmen"" worked, it worked perfectly. Excellent period detail, realistic violence (so brave of Zack Snyder to not compromise on showing the hard violence of the original book to get a more audience friendly certificate), massive scope and beautifully pitched performances. (No better performance than that of Billy Cudrup. A walking, talking special effect, to be true, but his calm serene voice hinted a unknown reserves of power and philosophical intelligence. He was the perfect Dr. Manhattan.)<br/><br/>There is a small part of me that feels sad that he will now never see the Gilliam/Aronofsky/Greeengrass versions of ""Watchmen"", but Zack Snyder made a great film. It was a hard movie to pull off. He should be proud."
"joestank15","8","2","6","8 March 2009"," Not all of it meshes, but very entertaining.
","Watchmen - Zack Snyder's much awaited treatment of the Alan Moore saga has vigilante Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) on the hunt for the person responsible for another superhero's death. In a sweeping epic that spans several decades, we see an alternate world where the U.S.A won Vietnam, Richard Nixon serves as president for three terms, and America has Dr. Manhattan, a man turned demi-god with unfortunately the same amount of vested interest in our human affairs.<br/><br/>Goodness, it took an ordeal to bring this to the cinema. I hope those who have waited far longer than me for Watchman are satisfied with the results. More than satisfied in my case. I enjoyed the graphic novel, loved Rorschach and Ozymandias, but didn't acquire quite the same level of adoration as millions of other comic book fans. I can safely say that Zack Snyder and screenwriter David Hayter did a fine job transposing the enormous source material into something fitting for the cinema. Is it perfect? No. But it's as good as anyone could hope for, and I had a really good time.<br/><br/>First off, Jackie Earle Haley deserves much props, if not some sort of nomination for bringing this excellent portrayal of Rorschach to the screen. He is an inspired choice, though I will always wonder how Daniel Craig would have done. Patrick Wilson brings the persona of Clark Kent to a very Adam West Batman (costume-wise) version of the second Nite Owl. Billy Crudup's voice is soothing and appropriate as Dr. Manhattan. Matthew Goode was intellectual and intimidating as Ozymandias. I hope to see more from him in the future.<br/><br/>I won't nit-pick about what was left out of the film because that's a fairly useless way to go about things on what is a FILM review. I learned my lesson when I was 13 and would not stop nit-picking about what was left out of a Harry Potter film. What is important is that this film contains much of the spirit of the original source. Watchman is still very much so a thinking comic book fan's film. Whether it appeals to audiences outside of that group is up to the box office figures to say.<br/><br/>I won't deny there are some cogs that don't mesh. For the love of God, could our make-up and prosthetics teams come as far as CGI has in the last 17 years? Some of the agings are fairly unrealistic. The violence didn't need to be quite this graphic, which is not to say the fights weren't entertaining. They are, but some of the bone crunching would have been more effective had it not been so splattered in our faces. The fights are lovely and visceral, but more befitting of current superhero films than of Moore's original work. Hence my being on the fence about that subject. There's also the heavy hint of Snyder's slo-motion work, which was really over-used on 300 and borders on being so at times here.<br/><br/>Not all of Watchmen meshes as a whole, but it's still an entertaining film that I'd gladly see again. A must for fans of comic books, philosophy and history, Watchmen gets a B+"
"Ajd01","10","2","6","8 March 2009"," Who watches the Watchmen? Me. And I'll do it again.
","Whatever your views on whether or not this film ever should of been made, the beauty of the finished article is something that can not be denied. Though Alan Moore will never acknowledge the project, what Snyder has produced is a tribute to Moore's imagination and a near perfect homage to his work. Though there are some changes, other bits missing and the occasional bit of artistic license used, the movie is about as faithful a translation of the novel as one could realistically wish for. It looks sublime, the action is incredible and the general atmosphere absorbing. I loved the novel and loved the film, proof that the two needn't be mutually exclusive. <br/><br/>Despite it lasting nearly three hours, perhaps the biggest compliment I can give this film is that upon leaving the cinema, both my girlfriend and I looked at one another and said ""We need to go see that again - very soon!"" <br/><br/>A wonderful achievement and a fantastic film."
"Polaris_DiB","8","2","6","7 March 2009"," Quelle surprise!
","Well I did my civic duty and went to watch the Watchmen. Gotta say, this is some good adapted cinema. Zack Snyder plays it close enough to the original comic book that only die-hard fans will nitpick, and he manages to make a movie that can be enjoyed over some three hours and counting that doesn't feel all that long while sitting in the actual theatre. Considering the last thing he did was that real stain 300, we can tell that the really significant difference between the quality of one comic book film and the other adapted by him is the source material. Watchmen is a classic, and the movie does it a fair bit of justice.<br/><br/>I can't speak to what people who HAVEN'T read the original source material will think about it, except that there was a disturbing amount of children in the audience attending the screening. Note to parents: comic book movies don't mean friendly all American superheroes. Actually, that's the image that this movie deconstructs, and with lots of disturbing material even by today's standards. However, for the REST of the world going to see it with no expectations, it tells the story quite well and hits the major points fluently, which is refreshing, and it is well-paced and entertaining, though in some places dark. Can't wait to hear what people who haven't read the comic have to say about the ending... gotta be good.<br/><br/>Even the acting is pretty true to the original characters, which is surprising. Seems the actors did their research and feel those characters, which is a change in form for many adaptations, I must say. If Snyder leaves a personal print on this, it's in the music. Some of his choices work... some of them are unintentionally funny. Oh well.<br/><br/>I'm sorry I'm writing this review as a comparison to the novel, which I'm sure there is no end of all across the Internet. It's just hard, when having experienced another version first, not to compare the two materials, and Snyder sticks so closely to Moore's ideas (if maybe not his specific vision... credit removed, yet again!) that the movie almost begs cross-reference. I for one miss the primary colors of the graphic novel, but that's just me. I'm sure other fans have their own personal beef with the movie, but I think in the end it is the audience who aren't previously acquainted who will really show how effective this movie is.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"webbwerx","6","2","6","7 March 2009"," Meh it would have been better to leave Alan Moore on the cutting room floor.
","I never liked the comic. I've always thought it was way overrated. It has some premises that are interesting and seemed innovating in 1985. But I have always thought the characters were ""over the top"" poor imitations of cliché super heroes. That's why I never dug it. With this film adaption I had hoped that they would ""hollywoodize"" it a bit and make it better. In some ways they did, all the characters in it are superior to the comic's versions, including Dr. M's wang. The film in many ways was near frame to panel with the comic. There were a few subplots dropped, like the newsstand thing, the cops chasing Rorshach just two steps behind, and the giant alien monster! However all those losses did nothing to hurt the film and honestly helped it in my opinion. I mean the new ending is actually superior to the comics ending and probably will save the film for audiences that are unfamiliar with Alan Moore's work. But the film is too close to the comic still, it frames like the comic, too tight, and follows the original plot too close which in all honesty is boring and a has long drawn out moments where it just fizzles.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes of history lessons that introduces audiences to Alan Moore's twisted world. Part of me says you could probably walk out after this and be satisfied with the price of the movie. It really is that good! Finally, and this was unexpected, but really the reason I just don't hate the movie, Night Owl... I hated this character in the comic and often times skipped over scenes with him in it... which easy to do since his relevance in the comic seems only a cliché marker to the batman like character of comics. But in this movie the actor brings him to life. I mean he shines in this. With all the fizzle points in the film I often found myself longing for the film to return to his plot. To be completely honest the movie would have been great if it has just been a Night Owl film.<br/><br/>What I didn't like was the sex scene in Archie (Night Owl's Airship), ugh it was a horrible awkward uncomfortable moment that was drawn out and made me and the people around me want to walk out. Sadly earlier in the film the two characters have a similar scene where they are suppose to be awkward and I found that scene cute romantic and original. Over all though the sex scenes in the film were nothing more to me than poor superhero porn. (and for god sakes that song was awful it was like they were just trying to make me hate sex.)<br/><br/>I HATED Dr. M in the Comic and I hate him in the movie. Period, game over. I know he is needed in order to make sense of the final plot, but I wish they would have given him less scenes and cut him back. I dreaded every scene where his blue began to shine. The actor was fine, Dr. M just annoys me to no end.<br/><br/>In the end, if Zack Snyder hadn't tried so hard to please Alan Moore this would have been a better movie. I honestly think Alan Moore should realize that Film is another medium for his character to live in. He should respect that film makers take him and his characters seriously and that Snyder made a masterpiece version of Moore's graphic novel that by all rights would have been better if he had left more of Alan's work on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Alan Moore should buck up, go see it, because it is eye candy, accept that it is a movie, walk over to Zack Snyder, thank him for bringing his characters to life for so many people who will fall in love with this movie (and hate my review). Then thank the guy who played Night Owl II... It is rare and unique to see a character made better by an actor and Patrick Wilson does just that. It left me wanting more Night Owl and Spectre.<br/><br/>Yes I will go see this movie again Monday and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD. Because for all that fizzles in this film, Patrick Wilson, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jackie Earle Haley, Malin Akerman and Zack Snyder make it Shine! Special note to Alan Moore and his loyalist: SHUT UP! You people are so lucky to see your characters brought to life with so much respect. Countless writers and their fans would kill to have people take their work as seriously as Zack Snyder took Moore's. Go pay some respect, because they have paid you all plenty with this film. And in many ways hurt their own craft trying to make you happy.<br/><br/>Note to Alan Moore and his loyalist: SHUT UP!

","By seeing the title you might believe that I tend to over exxagerate. But I have only said that the movie I have seen is the best ever twice. After The Dark Knight, and after Watchmen. Pre release hype had been very big for the movie, and it lived up to it. It was gripping, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. For something that was meant to be unfilmable Zack Snyder has done a pretty good job. The ending is also completely caught me off guard. It wasn't what you would expect to happen. I think this is also a rare movie that it's too good to be fully appreciated by critcs. I knew some fans would hate it because thats the territory that comes with an Alan Moore adaptation, but critics? Its such a good film. And it doesn't seem as long as it is. When I was watching Benjamin Button, I was aware that I had been in the cinema for a very long time. But this movie went by so quickly, and it's longer. It was like it took me away from the cinema. I think the main problem critics have is a blockbuster movie that cost over $100m actually delivers intelligence and makes you think (when has the theory of time been mentioned in a film that cost that much money before). To sum up, a movie that is intelligent, looks incredible, has great action sequences and justifies such a long length needs to be watched. I would recommend that everyone watches Watchmen."
"aaproductions07","10","2","6","7 March 2009"," 'Watchmen' is a movie that leaves you, ""WOW!""
","""Watchmen"" is the first movie of 2009 that will leave you at awe. It's visually stunning, well acted all around, terrific direction by Zack Snyder, and overall pleasing to see & experience. Now, for the geek critique stuff. Yes, there's NO squid ending, but this new ending works in more ways than you could possibly imagine. It truly is an incredible ending, and frankly I wish Alan Moore thought of it. It ties everything together about human nature and why we're a race that wants nothing more than control. Also, there is no murder of Hollis Mason, but from what I read it will appear in the Directors Cut. No, Black Freighter, saw that coming when the movie was being made, lucky for us, it comes out on DVD in a couple of weeks and will intertwine in the ""Ultimate Directors Cut"". I guess the 2 little things that erk'd me were the following, the old age make up (wasn't too convincing) and second, Matthew Goode as Ozzy. He just came off too much like a douche. I don't know, anyway, overall the movie is Astounding! It gets a solid A grade! As a manic fan of the graphic novel, the movie was pretty much a great adaptation and I don't think anyone else could've done it better, way to go Zack Snyder!"
"dvc5159","8","2","6","7 March 2009"," Completely blew me away.
","""Watchmen"" is a visual feast from start to finish. But not just that; it is also an excellent film overall, because of a terrific screenplay, stylish direction and great acting. It is one of the VERY best superhero movies ever made.<br/><br/>The actors are rightly cast as their respective characters. Akerman is drop-dead beautiful as Silk Spectre, but she shows that she can act, too. Patrick Wilson, as Nite Owl, perfect for the part. Billy Crudup as the haunted and mysterious Dr. Manhattan, emotionless and chilling, is just spot on (and daring, he's naked in almost every scene he's in). Matthew Goode as the brains of the Watchmen, Ozymandias, quite right for the part. The standouts, however, are Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian. Both are the two most interesting characters in the movie, and, having such flawed backgrounds and human traits, pull off their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>Very rare have I seen a mainstream film having such complexity in it. It has slow moments, but they're gripping. The story is devoid of any superhero movie cliché, and (especially for newcomers to the graphic novel) steering away from audience expectations and going for surprises. Be warned, the film has several ""what-if"" questions presented to the audience, so it may be hard to digest for some. It is deep, it is fascinating, it is gripping from start to finish. True, it is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore which I haven't read before. In fact, I had absolutely no idea of what ""Watchmen"" is all about until this film. Which is why I was completely blown away by the film.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliantly executed with style by director Snyder. This is Snyder's film, his personal project, and he really puts his heart and soul into making his dream come true. All I can say is, his hard effort paid off in full and he made the film into his own. Most of the action sequences are chock-filled with dazzling visual effects. Snyder also adds some classic songs to synchronize with what's happening on the screen, and it is done perfectly. Instead of the rapid-rock music and fast pace we got in 300, here Snyder allows us to enjoy the beautiful visuals due to the slow but absorbing pace. The film has a dark theme (thanks to the direction, the beautiful cinematography and Tyler Bates' brooding score) from start to finish, and there is graphic bloody violence (not to mention sex) in some scenes, so this film is definitely NOT for the kiddies and NOT for the squeamish. It is a full-blown movie MADE FOR MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY.<br/><br/>Newcomers will have to be open minded to fully appreciate the raw power and sheer brilliance of the film. It can stand on the ""podium"" along with ""The Dark Knight"". A viewing in the local cinemas is a MUST. This film is destined to be an instant success, so skip the Satan-like Jonas Brothers 3D crap-fest and show he kids what REAL ADULTS go to see. I'm not sure whether it is loyal to Moore's graphic novel since I haven't read it, but I did read his previous ""V For Vendetta"" novel, and I think he would be pleased with this film. I see a huge future for all actors, with Akerman, Wilson, and Crudup getting mainstream Hollywood success, while Haley and Morgan would get Oscar-worthy roles.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10"
"Hockeyo92","8","2","6","7 March 2009"," Makes you want to watch silent films again.
","First of, I read watchmen the week before I saw it. It was damn near perfect. The ending is... indescribably perfect. So with great expectations, I sat down in the cinema to see what Mr. Znyder could deliver, or if he could deliver. <br/><br/>He did. Mostly. The film starts off excellently with the killing of the comedian(played to perfection by Jeffery Dean Morgan), and is a superbly shot scene. Then, as the opening title appears, Bob Dylan is played. Yes, that is right. The opening title itself is a terrific, funny, helpfull and cool. But for god's sake, a man was just thrown out the window, Bob Dylan is not appropriate! <br/><br/>The film continues, Roarshach is introduced & played perfectly, and the plot evolves. Just a wee bit slow. We get introduced to all the characters, most of whom play their part excellently. The only one I didn't quite like was Ozymandis. <br/><br/>As the film progresses it look gorgeous, and contains all the key scenes and quotable comments. But also dreadful music. The most obvious scene that springs to mind is sex scene with Nite Owl & Silk Spectre, with a horrid verison of Hallelujah in the background.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, the movie looks and feels like true Watchmen. They DID manage to film it. But, despite the promising music in the trailer, it chose poor music at vital moments, making it feel a bit campy. <br/><br/>Yet, Watchmen is worth watching."
"psychogoatee","8","2","6","7 March 2009"," I watch the Watchmen, and I love it.
","Watching the Watchmen is a satisfying experience. I'm a fan of the comic, and this movie lived up to my lofty expectations completely.<br/><br/>I love the visual style of the film, and the music choices suit the mood nicely. It's kind of reminiscent of what Scorsese does with music in his films. The highly stylized look of the film, the use of CGI, I dig it all. Right from the very impressive opening credits, the movie pulls me into its world with the visuals and music.<br/><br/>The cast is great all around, they deliver the goods. Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl II, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, and Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre all resonate very strongly with me. Some folks have said that Malin Akerman's performance as Silk Spectre II is weak, I have no complaints personally.<br/><br/>Pretty much every artistic liberty the movie takes is fine with me. The villain comes across as more creepy in the movie than in the comic, I do enjoy this interpretation of the character as well. The various other changes also went smoothly with me. I feel that they did a perfect job adapting a very dense work into movie form.<br/><br/>The characters are as likable and flawed as ever, and the feel of paranoia and helplessness of the cold war is thick. The action is spectacular, brutal and satisfying. The tender moments are handled quite well also, giving us the full package of sex and violence.<br/><br/>Pretty much, Watchmen is a modern fable about vigilante heroes trying to fight the feeling of powerlessness during the Cold War. It's an uncompromising ride I plan to take many more times over the years."
"bubbathom","10","2","6","6 March 2009"," Purely Amazing
","I went into Watchmen with seemingly unreachable expectations, but miraculously they were met. Snyder somehow basically transformed, nearly word for word, the book into a movie.<br/><br/>The visual effects were spectacular. To those who said the violence was over-the-top, I agree, but I think it just added to the incredible effect of the movie. One thing I didn't like was the sound effects during the fight scenes. It sounded like martial arts, but that's just quibbling, so I'll just stop right there.<br/><br/>The actors were awesome, Especially Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffery Dean Morgan. The atmosphere was very well done, giving an excellent 80's feel with the music and such. The tone set in the first sequence was held throughout the entire movie, which is great.<br/><br/>One thing though that scares me is that those who haven't read the book may be very confused. I went with my friend who had not read the book besides like 10 pages before we left, and he said he was pretty confused for some of the time. But this is better than having it made mostly for those who haven't read the book. I just hope the people who haven't read the book won't dislike it because they were confused most the time.<br/><br/>Many people complained about the ending, and personally I like the ending in the book better, but it was a good move to change it because the audience that hadn't read the book would've been totally confused if the original ending were chosen. I showed my friend the ending and he said he would have been laughing if the original ending were in there instead. Plus, the effect is basically the same, so it doesn't REALLY matter.<br/><br/>So, this has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen, especially being adapted from such a great and complex book. I respect Zack Snyder much more now, he has proved that he can direct great movies. Watchmen earns a perfect 10 for me, a wonderful movie!"
"DonFishies","8","2","6","6 March 2009"," A breathtaking motion picture event
","Director Zack Snyder has done the impossible. He has made the ""unfilmable"", legendary graphic novel, Watchmen, into a film. But Watchmen is not merely a film  it is a motion picture event, unlike many that have come before it. The stakes were high, and the furor of fanboys worldwide would cause anyone a touch of anxiety over such a beloved property. But after the reverence and blood-splattered brilliance of 300, did anyone actually think Snyder would do a bad job?<br/><br/>Featuring a plethora of a cast, Watchmen takes place in an alternate 1985, where Richard Nixon is in his fifth-term as President, America won the Vietnam War, and costumed heroes have been banned. The film picks up with Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) investigating the murder of Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). He finds out early on that Blake is actually another costumed hero, The Comedian, and gets it in his head that there may be a ""mask killer"" on the loose, and Blake was just the beginning.<br/><br/>What unfolds of course is the stuff of comic book legend. Mixing intrigue, action, suspense, romance, horror, and pitch black comedy, Watchmen is a tale that is not for the faint of heart, and may leave more than one person baffled. The reverence for the source material bleeds right through each frame of the film, from the obnoxiously bright yellow opening to the colourfully drab finale. It is clear that Snyder, writers Alex Tse and Solid Snake himself, David Hayter, and the rest of the crew had the graphic novel close by at every waking moment to ensure authenticity to the book. So much of the graphic novel's twelve chapters have been reproduced here, and with such a heavy attention to detail that it is nearly a carbon copy.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some changes here and there, but many nuisances will only be picked up by the most avid of fans (the most obvious is the ending). They are simply well concealed, or have been modified so casually that it should not matter to anyone that it has been altered. The filmmakers even improve on a few of the flaws of the graphic novel (and still wallow in a few as well), almost complementing it as having a stroke of originality to it. Yes, some things have been outright removed as well (and should appear in the future, already announced Extended Cut DVD releases), but again, many of these removals are for the better.<br/><br/>This is of course, due to the editing of the picture. At 163 minutes, this movie is a touch gargantuan in nature. But after sifting through the lengthy backstory moments early on in the film, the film practically flies by. For such densely loaded material, Snyder and company have managed to address practically everything, and have not sacrificed the film's pacing. There are a few slow spots, but never do they feel as drawn out as the likes of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. I was genuinely surprised by just how fast it flew by, and how new the material felt even though I knew every beat that was coming. They just make the material so interesting that it becomes too difficult to bear looking away for any instant.<br/><br/>But the film's pacing manages to still be an issue. The filmmakers managed to make the film accessible and understandable to readers and non-readers alike, but at times it may feel a little overwhelming for anyone new to the story. It is clearly not to the point that the film is for fanboys only, but there is a certain aura about the film that stalls it from immediately registering for everyone. I even had to second guess myself on more than one occasion, and imagine I will be explaining this film for a long time coming. The film is incredible either way, but I think a few extra minutes of explanation could have helped the film go a long way.<br/><br/>The acting is great across the board. Haley is an absolute marvel as Rorschach, exhibiting an even greater performance than his Oscar-nominated turn in Little Children. He plays him with just the right amount of psychopathic touch that the audience is still able to feel pathos when needed. His attitudes are so twisted and his personality so convoluted that it is almost like watching two different people, instead of just him. He is so in tune it is downright frightening. Much the same goes for Morgan. He does not get an immense amount of screen time, but he does an amazing job with what he is given. This character is the worst kind of scum, but Morgan still makes him likable, and brings a gritty edge totally missing from the graphic novel. It will be hard not thinking of his portrayal anytime I read the graphic novel from here on out.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast, no matter how significant, are overshadowed or downplayed because of these two overbearing performances. Despite being on screen for a significant amount of time, I just could not latch onto Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl II. He just lacks the right strength and looks, to make something of this character. Malin Akerman does a great job with Silk Spectre II, as does the heavily CGI-ed Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan. But the two of them never seem to be totally immersed in their characters like Haley or Morgan. Their stories and dialogue are there, but they lack the intensity of the original work. Matthew Goode is simply not given enough to make the impression he needs to as Ozymandias.<br/><br/>Watchmen is not perfect, but then it never was going to be. Despite this, Snyder and company have crafted a truly reverent work unlike any other we will see for a long time. With breaktaking scenes, and amazing performances from at least two cast members, Watchmen needs to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>8/10."

","After all the hype I was really excited to go watch Watchmen tonight. The cinema was packed, lets say the WoW servers must have been empty tonight! :) To admit in all honesty I found the movie very boring and I think that was the same response from a few people there. The actor performances were very poor and so were the special effects. Very lame sex scene and perhaps a bit too much 'silly nudity'. What I feel they could have made a really interesting movie, just ended up being a product of poor production. Very predictable and dull. I wouldn't recommend people to see it in a hurry unless you are a die-hard fan of the book."

","I prefer the theatrical cut.<br/><br/>Good movie. very different from typical superhero movies. i hated this when i first watched it in theaters, partially because i thought it was going to be an action movie which it is absolutely not, and partially because it's for more advanced viewers. there is a lot of good in this movie. so many cool-looking scenes and beautiful shots. aesthetically pleasing as usual from zack snyder. but it was long and requires patience. and it's lacking in some areas. some of the casting was way off. i didn't like the girl or night owl. rorshak or however you spell it was awesome, and dr. manhattan was intriguing.

all the stuff that happened at the end was cool, dr manhattan killing his friend after siding with the villain and how that all played out. and also the very end which shows that rorschach is going to get the truth out, which may lead to the end of the peace and the restarting of nuclear escalation"

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","9","1","2","13 July 2017"," Watchmen is the Blade Runner of Superhero Movies!
","Watchmen is one of the most underrated superhero movies to come out in the 2000s. It's the somewhat beloved, somewhat hated, somewhat misunderstood adaptation of the classic graphic novel of the same name. It's a Zack Snyder film, so unfortunately its reception was destined to be divisive among the public. But what he achieved here was remarkable: actually taking the Watchmen comic, a graphic novel long thought to be 'unfilmable', and making a comprehensive movie out of it.<br/><br/>The movie is very faithful to the comic, but sometimes it can come across as being a little TOO faithful at times. It's great seeing the classic story finally getting the film treatment it deserves but there's only select creative-liberties Snyder decided to go with. The ending is a little different from the book, and Ozymandias' design is a parody of the infamous Bat-nipple-suit from Batman and Robin. Besides these changes, it's still very watchable and the pacing is on-point here.<br/><br/>Bottomline: if you're a superhero buff, give this one a shot."
"xXenomorphx","7","1","2","22 August 2016"," An okay attempt at adapting one of the greatest graphic novels of all time
","The 1986 graphic novel was amazing due to its depth, complexity, darkness, it being timeless, and its realistic attempt at the superhero genre.<br/><br/>The 2009 movie, is good on its own, but only because it copied the graphic novel, but just did it worse. The dialogue, story, and even some of the imagery is ripped straight on of the novel. The movie is a faithful adaption, but none of the credit can be given to the movie. This movie has depth, is dark, and complex, but not nearly as the same level as the novel. Any of the themes you can find is just a result of the script that was copied from the book. Something that it doesn't copy from the book is the action. The fighting is brutal, violent, and fun to watch, but extremely unrealistic. It misses the point that the story is supposed to be realistic. The ending, which I won't spoil, is a lot worse, and doesn't really resolve any problems the way it was supposed to. Overall, almost anything good about the movie is just copied from the graphic novel, and everything else it does is just bad. If you haven't read the book, the movie gives no effort for you don't understand or enjoy what's going on.<br/><br/>The directing, cinematography, and visuals are amazing, but the acting is very mediocre at some moments. <br/><br/>The movie is okay, and worth a watch if you've read the graphic novel, but if you haven't, just read the book. It is miles better than this."

With the exception of a few scenes, namely Rorschach's ""You're locked in here with me"" scene and the scene in which Dr Manhattan kills him (6/155 minutes), the film did not stay true to the point of the graphic novel. I wanted to see more Walter Kovacs as ""The End is Nigh"" guy, more mundane life, more old washed up masked vigilantes..Dan wasn't fat enough, Sally wasn't old enough, we plain didn't see enough of Hollis. The Watchmen didn't deserve to be compacted in this way, it needed to be 3 or more movies or no movie at all. Skip the movie, read the book. The Watchmen as a graphic novel is a loaded post modern object that can be read into in a plethora of ways.

The dialouge was taken straight out of the comic and came off really cheesy. Also this movie had horrible acting the good actors were Rorsharch and the comedian. And where was the original soundtrack if you are going to make an epic superhero movie you cant just pick some random songs from your ipod. And right when i was getting interested in the movie he throws in a 10 minute sex scene and i was ready to leave. Snyder makes a descent attempt at watchmen but it can definitely be better.

","Watchmen is a truly mediocre film. From the moment the pseudo-historical montage reels to the movie's lengthy, inconclusive ending, it provides the viewer with a sharp displeasure. To begin with, the film is too long for its own good. At 2 hours and 41 minutes, it oozes with excessive musical montages, gratuitous sex scenes, and frankly disgusting levels of gore and violence. Although these elements are supposed to contribute to the nostalgic sentiment and superhero mood of the film, they weigh the film down, so that one is consistently bored throughout the entire, cumbersome movie. Second, the movie is a rank pustule of sensational photographs and hit-you-over-the-head literary references (e.g. Ozymandias). But these aspects of the movie are not what make me mark it 5 stars out of 10; it is rather the hopelessly tangled fragmentation of events. The scenes oscillate from one washed-up generation of superheroes to the next and ultimately comprise a confusing, incomplete storyline. Many of these perplexing scenes are flashbacks to the past or visions of the future; none of them satisfy. Redeeming points include: good acting jobs all round, a fun portrayal of Nixon-era politics, and an excellent soundtrack that includes 3 Bob Dylan songs. These can't make up for the inherent averageness of the movie, but it isn't unwatchable. p.s. that large floppy blue object really is his penis."
"knives123","10","3","12","5 March 2009"," A Fan's Dream Come True
","I'll start off with the fact it is about 85% loyal to the comic. 10% of this are having the comic itself transform into a workable script, adding and removing minor bits, altering dialogs a bit and turning some info from Under The Hood and such into actual text in the movie. The remaining 5% are altered scenes, including the so-called different ending, and I'll get to that.<br/><br/>The movie itself is insanely faithful, and in a great way. Many scenes, like the Mars flashback or the fight in the alley interwoven with cuts into exposition work as seamlessly as they did in the book. A lot of notable quotes made it into the movie, and a lot of notable quotes were added. Rorshach's journal is, if memory serves, verbatim. The order of things and a significant amount of images are precise, which doesn't just go to service the geek fandom - it looks genuinely good, and works genuinely well.<br/><br/>Some scenes have changed - remember the scene that Saw shamelessly ripped off from Watchmen, and earned it it's name-sake? Well, it isn't in it's original form in the Watchmen movie... and for good reason, I guess. Nobody wants all the Watchmen rookies going ""Har, that's from SAW!"" Besides, what happens in the scene in the movie makes a little bit more contextual sense, so I'm alright with it. The ending is different, yes, but in a way that does indeed work better for a movie. In fact, it would've worked better in the comic-book, too, in my opinion.<br/><br/>What would the lay-men think of this movie? I think some will see it as a stunning, relentless and ultra-violent masterpiece like we have known the comic-book to be for years, whilst some will simply stare blankly at it and won't know what to make of it. It's fast, super-fast, and raises so many questions and has so many details and asks so many philosophical inquiries, that, in book form, are a lot easier to handle. When John drops the ""no god"" bomb, when Rorschach reveals his depravity, when Dan is... unable to step up to the plate, it's all so... fast moving. And that's how I read it, and how I understood it, and how I enjoyed it. I'm simply not so sure about everyone else. The masses probably won't love it to bits as much as they liked the Dark Knight. But I know I love it so much more.<br/><br/>It is gory, it is unrelenting, it is beautifully crafted. The soundtrack is spot-on. The slow-motion, the choreography, the sets, the design, the colors - it all works perfectly.<br/><br/>So, hat's off to Zack Snyder. You are a good, kind and wise man. You have done an excellent job. Everything I second guessed you for, I was proved wrong. Your new ending is a lot more compelling to those who found the squid ending a bit weird, and indeed works much better in a movie.<br/><br/>Watchmen is an amazing film. It is not quite as riveting as it is in book form, but dammit, it seems like one of the best comic books I've ever read makes a really damn good movie, too. An excellent one, even. It is by far the best comic book movie ever made, and it's near perfect in adapting one of the best comic books ever written, and with a final director's cut on the way with The Black Freighter and Under the Hood, I can't freakin' WAIT."

But I liked it, actually I liked every choice he made (even small costume changes, like the one Night-Owl went through) and I liked the actors in it too. Because I wasn't aware of the novel, the movie began with quite a ""Bang"" for me. I only had seen pictures of the characters up to that point and was kinda shocked, with how the movie began. In a good way of course. I can only recommend this movie, even though I know that not everyone enjoyed the movie (my niece and her friends weren't too excited about it, as they told me later). But if you like your movies to be daring and controversial, not to mention mature and at least a bit thought provoking, then you should watch this or at least read the graphic novel!"
"Quebec_Dragon","9","2","7","24 May 2009"," Powerful and complex, definitely not your typical super-hero movie
","I'm wondering whether I should restrain my enthusiasm for fear of raising expectations too much for potential viewers. Keep in mind that Watchmen got mixed reviews and that it's not for everyone. I'm a huge fan of the original graphic novel, I had my doubts but this movie really impressed me. The director probably did the best adaptation that could have been done and I still wonder how he got away with it, how it did not get more ""hollywoodized"" in a negative sense. Throughout the projection, I was in awe at the world that was created and any negative aspect I could find here (because no it isn't perfect) would be nitpicking (one of them being the choice of music during the owl ship scene in a soundtrack which I otherwise found quite good). Watchmen is great in so many ways: rich in plot, visually stunning, smart, original, philosophical food for thought, shocking unpredictable twists (for those who didn't read the book), exciting action scenes, very good performances and memorable anti-hero characters (especially Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan) to name a few highlights.<br/><br/>It's far from your typical super-hero movie; it's a bold, dark, complex and magnificent of work that will certainly become a cult film if not the masterpiece of the director Zak Snyder whether or not it's a financial success. The opening montage showing the history of this alternate world where costumed heroes appeared is not only useful but bloody brilliant and deserves special recognition if not an award of some sort. The storyline itself is fascinating and very well told through layers of flashbacks and a personal journal (heard as the narrator) while also being a murder mystery. More interesting though are the characters themselves, portraits of what multi-faceted costumed ""heroes"" might be like in the ""real"" world. You might not like them but you'll likely find them interesting. Some might find the film meandering, confusing and too long but to me it's because there's so much good material and there's no way you can catch everything with just one viewing (another incentive to get the DVD). From a cinematography point of view, it's a wonder with amazing camera work, brutal yet graceful action choreography and atmospheric set designs. It's peppered with beautiful visual signatures (the first being the iconic smiley face in the puddle) that often are hommages to comic book panels.<br/><br/>I only hope that this film and Dark Knight (which I also loved) doesn't usher in a tidal wave of super-hero movies that are dark, gritty, violent without the depth, heart and ambiguity that makes them work, especially for characters that should not be as dark (like Superman!). This negative influence happened to the comics after Watchmen and the Dark Knight returns were published in the mid-eighties... (by the way Dark Knight Returns is about Batman but has nothing to do with the movie Dark Knight except perhaps they're both for mature audiences) There are a few warnings to go with my praise though. If you're allergic to graphical violence (there's a few quick gory scenes), expect something similar to Spider-Man or Batman, want something family-friendly, want typical ""super-heroes"" (notice the quotation marks) or can't get beyond seeing a blue penis (which by the way is faithful to the graphic novel), then you won't like Watchmen. If you want to see an original intelligent dramatic superhero action film and excellent adaptation of a seminal work in the comic book medium (originally published in 1986-87) that was extremely influential and changed the perception of what super-hero stories could achieve, then you might like it. You don't need to read the book to appreciate the movie but you'll appreciate and understand it more if you do read it either before or after (I would suggest after so the movie is more visceral and surprising to you). The movie is self-contained and will not have sequels. It's definitely worth getting but choose your edition carefully so you don't end up buying it twice and encouraging the publisher's money grabbing. There's a 5 disc Ultimate edition coming up before Christmas 2009 Rating: A very strong 9/10"

","Once the protectors of the citizens on the run down and dirty streets, now themselves threatened by scandals and darker forces that want to eradicate them. They are watchmen. They are in a danger greater than any danger that ever threatened the people they swore to protect, and they are unwatched, except by themselves. Times are dark, crimes are running wild and the citizens have learned to distrust these former heroes.<br/><br/>Based on a graphic novella this film is very different from what people may think it to be after watching the trailers - the trailers show what seems to be a more or less mindless science fiction action flick that has little worth thinking about. This film proves to be a lot better than just that. In fact, this film might be classed as a drama in a science fiction surrounding. A lot is done to work out the different characters and some of them come of the screen very well. My personal favorite would be Rorschach who depicts the classical warped mind that has gone beyond all borders of normality, living in his own world with his own rules. There is a great deal of special effects in this film but none of them work against the film - they add to the story in the good way. I have never read the novella so I don't know how well the conversion was done, but from what I heard it isn't too bad of a conversion. For me this film could have done a small bit better by working out the characters some further still, and the ending story is a little too much of a classic cliché. Still, worth a watch.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 fallen heroes"

Yes, the scenes are so carefully fabricated and I bet a second time viewing would still be full of fun by discovering the previously-unnoticed.<br/><br/>Then, the metaphor and the philosophy...omy, how could so many conflict and sophisticated mindsets and concepts be so perfectly merged into one story and so naturally to be presented?

"statistician_t","9","2","7","19 March 2009"," The first well-made film of 2009
","One of the few films I admire. I really admire. And that take you away already in the first few minutes, when the highly cartoonish and stylized front credits pass. Wow, what sort of film is following that crazy introduction? Are they going to keep that promise? The film never let me down, not during one single minute. The scenes featuring Philip Glass' ""Prophecy"" and ""Pruit Igoe"" were eerie, Dr. Manhattan was a believable character, the romance between Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl something I really liked because they were so true characters.<br/><br/>I loved the stylized violence in the fight scenes because they showed what imaginative movie makers are capable of, similar to ""A Clockwork Orange"" which would not be discussed and praised that much without its foundation  the depicted violence.<br/><br/>It's difficult finding anything negative about ""Watchmen"". I do not know the underlying graphic novel, and so I found Veidt's/Ozymandias' lair in the Antarctica something weird. Why something so far away? Why something so elaborate when he could have built his dungeon somewhere in a rain forest which would have been much nearer to his New York? But I agree Veidt is very egoistic and lone figure, and that he wants to be as far away from populated areas as possible.<br/><br/>Something else I have to attest is the high self-confidence and maturity with which ""Watchmen"" referenced the 9/11 attacks, without having been intended so by the novelist (the comics came out in 1986 and 1987). But because I felt that the film weaves in the course of history so well  especially when the plot touched the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the ongoing tenure of Richard M. Nixon  I was very, very willing to forgive the ""pun"" made on the 9/11 attacks. The same city devastated, and the same city having a gaping hole which is being filled again by erecting a new structure. These images were a little scary, yes.<br/><br/>In sum, let me thank the movie makers for delivering the first *good* film of the year 2009!"

"flowsnobordr","9","2","7","9 March 2009"," Amazing Movie
","First I would like to get one thing straight... This is the WATCHMEN, not a 300 follow up. Why is everything done in this movie directly compared to 300. Snyder has done another work besides that known as the remake of Dawn of the Dead. I mean no one bashed 300 for not having the same feel as DotD. Everyone feels like 300 is his only good work due to the cinematography and the visual presentation. My God no one that is a director wants to do the same thing over and over and if you are someone looking for that just start 300 over after you watch it.<br/><br/>Now for my own review... I felt this movie was amazing. The alterations from book to movie did not disappoint. Such as how Jon became Dr. Manhattan and the ending itself did dignify the novels original events. The music was amazing from Dr. Manhattan's time on Mars to playing Bob Dylan for the opening credits. Also the fact they had Veidt's ""Nostalgia"" playing in the background during the Comedian's murder. The movie itself cut out stuff that makes one think there will be a much more extended edition DVD. People complain about time but, if this movie was cut any shorter it would not allow for any character development or a plot to develop. The couple things I feel they should have explained better was the Keene Act, Manhattan's past, and Rorschach's past. Also taking some scenes and expanding them with action that was called for was something Snyder saw was needed and was perfect. Perfect examples were: Rorschach beating up the cops after falling out of the window instead of falling on his face and Veidt's associates being used as human shields as he made his move on killing the assassin instead of just taking him down after he shoots just Veidt's secretary. Last, my favorite shot in the entire movie was the ending, when Rorschach was killed by Manhattan, and his blood made a trace of an angel... Great visual Snyder.<br/><br/>Snyder is a director to be recognized as both amazing and one to make graphic novels take new beautiful form."
"howell-adamz","10","2","7","8 March 2009"," Great movie
","Let me preface this review by saying that I am not a long time fan of the graphic novel, having never heard of Watchmen until I saw the preview for this movie. Having said that, I think this was an absolutely brilliant movie. And yes- it was almost three hours long, but to me it didn't feel like it. It's not your typical ""feel good"" super-hero movie. It's more that that- I found it to be thought provoking, and I think those who have stated that it was boring are so used to being entertained by mindless action and sexuality, that when action and sensuality are coupled with plot that requires thought and concentration, they probably are not sure which portions of their brain to engage. It is definitely a movie worth seeing, but make sure your brain is turned on from the very beginning. The story is dark, the characters are even darker. I found it to be delightfully different from anything I've ever seen. That, to me is a very positive thing. I see people comparing to 300 and I don't understand why. Same director, different movie- different kind of movie- entirely different subject matter. Is it any wonder that it would be handled differently?? Honestly, people. I didn't have ""warm fuzzies"" when I left the theater after seeing this movie, but I don't think that's a bad thing."
"Neenee-b","10","2","7","7 March 2009"," Watch it
","After worries of legal battles and murmurings of delayed release dates Watchmen finally arrived on the 6th March but I will confess that up until one year I ago I had never heard of the Watchmen. It wasn't until I discovered that Jeffrey Dean Morgan was cast as The Comedian it caught my attention and forced me to read the graphic novel.<br/><br/>I had never read a graphic novel before the Watchmen and thought I would struggle through it but I read it in a matter of days. I couldn't put it down. The initial excitement for JDM turned into genuine excitement for the movie itself and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved everything about it. The characters were exactly how I imagined them to be. Jackie Earle Haley was superb as Rorschach, my favourite character in the novel. His story was the one I enjoyed reading about most and it transferred so well onto the big screen. If it had of been a Rorschach movie I would have been happy. The prison scene and Rorschach's back-story were my favourite parts of the book and also the best parts of the film One teeny tiny grumble (I feel that I should had at least one complaint) is that the first time I heard his narration I thought it was Christian Bale's Batman talking. The gravely voice sounded so similar but within one scene that was quickly forgotten about.<br/><br/>The other characters were also very well played. Night Owl(2) (Patrick Wilson) and The Silk Spectre(2) (Malin Akerman) played well together on the big screen. I wasn't a big fan of Laurie's when reading the novel but I warmed to her in the movie version although the same cannot be said for Dr Manhattan. I totally understand the point of his character, I can see how he began to lose touch with humanity and I appreciate the irony of the only ""super"" hero not wanting to get involved but there is something about the character that I just don't like. I really detested the conversation he and Laurie had on Mars in the novel and I disliked it just as much in the movie. The fact that he was constantly telling her ""you will go to Dan"" or ""you will cry at the end of this conversation"" really just angered me. He is just one of those characters that you come across at times that you just cannot warm to.<br/><br/>There has been criticism of Matthew Goode being cast as Ozymandias, but once I just accepted that he wasn't that great at an American accent he was fine. As a Supernatural fan, of course seeing JDM play The Comedian was a major part of going to see the movie. He was awesome. The Comedian is has essentially all the ingredients for a super villain but by the end of the movie you cant help but like him. The rape and the Vietnam scenes were uncomfortable to read about and just as uncomfortable to watch. You know you have got a major bad-ass on screen when someone can fire a few rounds from a shotgun and not blink - JDM did just that in the riot scene on the streets of New York and I was very impressed.<br/><br/>The action was also very good. Perhaps there wasn't as much action as some people were expecting but when it arrived it came with a bang - and it was very graphic in parts, especially one scene with a chainsaw that even Leatherface would have flinched at.<br/><br/>The ending differed slightly from the book but I thought the movie ending was actually better and easier to understand but other than that it was faithful to the original text. Although it was left completely out of the movie Tales of the Black Freighter has been filmed and will be on the DVD and I am satisfied with that as it was almost as engaging as the main plot.<br/><br/>I would give the movie 10/10. I had been waiting for the movie for months and when it arrived it did not disappoint on any level - even the soundtrack was awesome. I would recommend it to anyone but I would also suggest that you read the novel too."

","This is not your ""normal"" comic book movie by any means. There is a LOT going on in this movie...even the opening credits need to be watched carefully to see how some of the main characters have developed in the past. There are also a LOT of flashbacks employed in the movie, which can be confusing for some...but they try to fill-in reasons why some of the main characters are acting the way that they are. The Rorshack character actually appears (without his mask) quite a few times in the movie, if you know what to look for. Watching this movie more than once may be a given if you really want to take in everything.<br/><br/>There is also a LOT of frontal male nudity from the Doctor Manhattan character. Why that guy can't morph himself some undies I'll never know. You'll see his manhood in various forms of being flaccid...so be prepared. For the guys though, expect to see some topless shots from at least one of the main female characters.<br/><br/>It would help when watching this movie if you had some basic knowledge of the political history of the USA (and the world in general) in order to understand exactly what has unfolded in this alternate Watchmen universe.<br/><br/>Watchmen is good, not great, flick, and it's definitely worth a view in the movie theater if you can catch it."

","In the late 1980's my dad arranged the first Comic Book festival to be held in the area. Having sold comics for years,my dad asked fellow traders if they knew anyone who could be a guest,which led to my dad getting Alan Moore's home phone number.<br/><br/>Taking a gamble,my dad phoned Moore and found him to be extremely friendly,with the only ""payment"" Moore took being a bundle of old British comics that my dad gave him. When i heard that Snyder had been hired to make this,i had some mixed feelings,but after seeing it,I am now thrilled to say the Snyder has made the film which reveals who watches the Watchmen.<br/><br/>
View on the film: Note i am reviewing the ultimate cut.<br/><br/>The first thing i have to mention is the inclusion of the Tales of the Black Freignhter into the film,which has a rough Anima look and a very morbid story,that helps at unrolling some loose links and making a stronger foundation of understanding the moods that the characters are feeling.<br/><br/>The voice of the film,Jackie Earle Haley gives a tremendous turn as Rorschach,with Haley giving a huge amount of dept,and expressiveness to someone who is (mostly) behind a mask in the film,and he also has a deep 1940s film Noir style voice. Billy Crudup gives an unnerving performance as Manhattan,,whose voice Crudup keeps calm,and his attitude collected,whilst the eye-catching Malin Akerman brings the sensitivities and frustrations Spectre has towards her fellow superheroes.<br/><br/>With the violence in the film,Snyder stylishly mixes the rough style action of Bourne films,with the smooth- slick refined Slo-Mo action . Although there are a few small flaws with the action, (The prison scene had way too much slow-mo)the main thing Snyder does well is being able to handle such a complex story and still keep it cinematic,even with ""strange"" edges in the panels (Manhattan sees hope in mankind,due to a girl forgiving an attempted rapist,and having a child with him!) Snyder grips the vast story in a strikingly confident manner, with the story going back-and-forth between the 1940's and 1980's,Snyder gives each era a different appearance,with the 40's having an ice cool post-WWII shine,and the 80's having a bit of a bright neon crisp,as the Watchmen find out who watches them."

"nferlisi","7","1","3","18 March 2020"," Looking at and past the divisiveness, so I can see more
","Among all films adapted from the world of comic books or graphic novels, this one has been considered one of the most divisive of them all, however, among the divisiveness I believe there is still something quite enjoyable and entertaining about this film. The divisiveness is understandable and I can get while people give this film a hard time. One of most commonly heard reasons behind the divisiveness is its faithfulness to the graphic novel or attempt at it. While there are maybe some problems with it, I can't help but admire some the positives in it.<br/><br/>I have to admire Zack Snyder with his effort to make this adaptation a reality. Comic book and graphic novels are not always very easy to do so, especially when it comes to something as highly regarded as Watchmen. I admit that I saw the film first before reading the graphic novel, but it did give me push to go and read it. The graphic novel is one of the best things I've read- massive complexity to its plot, thematic depth, dark/gritty comic book world, interesting use of colors, and dimensional characters. A lot of these elements can be seen in the Snyder's film adaptation- some are achieved while others are partially done, yet we also get some of Snyder's distinct cinematic style adding a new element to this adventurous adaptation. Going back to the general complaint about the film being ""too faithful"" to its original source material, I find that partially true. While the majority of the film does greatly resemble the graphic novel on a visual and narrative standpoint but does stray away some. The graphic novel is full of thought provoking themes and ideas the story involves itself with each page you flip to next, however, Snyder's film does try to invoke those same elements I mentioned a second ago, but only goes to a short distance when telling them. Another way of saying it could be that it's only on the surface level rather than wanting to dive deeper. Another thing I would like to mention since we live in the time of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, Watchmen doesn't try to sugar coat itself or lessen the darkness of it simply to fit a wider audience- mainly family and kid oriented target audiences. Just because it comes from a comic book doesn't mean it needs to sacrifice what made it so infamous and groundbreaking in order to fit a traditional formulated type film so that it pleases a general audience/make a quick buck.<br/><br/>Snyder manages to find a way to somewhat balance itself in its plot in order to get as much of Moore's original storyline but not feel like its leaving out too much or obviously rushing. The color I will say does tend to differ a lot from the graphic novel, in which it appears more colorful while the film goes for a more darker tone in the sense of color with the occasional pop of color(mainly from Dr. Manhattan). Following Zack Snyder's trademark use of slow motion, several moments in the film are enhanced by the visually impressive technique allow audiences(more for those who have read the graphic novel) to mentally visualize moments from the graphic novel as if they literally leaped out of their panels/coming alive. Production value exceeds very well in capturing the right look and feel of the world the Watchmen inhabit. Like any other comic book related film, when it comes down to the costumes and outfits for the characters there are a lot to consider or discuss. In the case of this film, the costumes for some characters remain identical to the original graphic novel's designs drawn by Dave Gibbons, while others were changed, some of it border-lining on campiness, yet it doesn't feel like it's done without good taste. The major addition to the film by Zack Snyder was the opening title sequence, which I found to be such an immersive visual tool throwing the audience directly into the world they are about to see. Not just the sheer visual images being presented on the screen are immersive, but Bob Dylan's song ""The Times They Are A-Changin"" perfectly compliments each moment in the sequence showing that times are changing both literally and metaphorically. This sequence I'm glad is in the film and strongly believe that the film wouldn't be same without it.<br/><br/>The main ensemble cast consisting of Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup, Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Goode, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan- come together to bring their characters to life right out of the graphic novel. The one character I'm most impressed with and found to be an awesome portrayal was Dr. Manhattan played by Billy Crudup. Out of the main characters Dr. Manhattan is by far my favorite of the Watchmen. There's such a rich emotional complexity and depth to the character, which Crudup completely immersed himself as that god-like figure struggling to balance his humanity and intellectual understanding. I think throughout the film a considerate amount of time was given to developing Dr. Manhattan character, which gave us the opportunity to see all his dimensions(sides). Besides the performance itself, the effort put into making Dr. Manhattan visually impressive as he comes off as an actual person/character on the screen rather than appear as just another one of many visual effects.<br/><br/>Watchmen is definitely something to admire about when it comes to adapting such an infamous piece of work from another medium. Again it does not completely matchup to Alan Moore and Davie Gibbon's graphic novel, but it does have a good number of positive qualities worth cheering about. Overall Star Rating: 7.6-7.7/10"

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>First of all, this review is based on the theatrical version of Watchmen. Usually, Director's Cuts or Ultimate Editions are not preferred over the original release. Few films benefit from them, and most are simply an extended cut with a bunch of deleted scenes. It's only fair and rational that a reviewer watches the version which the whole world saw at the theaters at the respective time. With that said, despite knowing the story of the source material, I never indeed read it. Having in mind that most of the ""hate"" that this Zack Snyder's movie received is from comic-book purists (basically, every book/comic/game/whatever-lover who defends that any cinematic adaptations of any of these sources MUST be 100% the same, with no modifications whatsoever), I'm certain an unbiased perspective is the way to go.<br/><br/>And overall, this is a good feature. Watchmen isn't just another CBM (comic-book movie). It doesn't just follow one hero vs. one villain. It's a whole world (in today's standards, it's really a cinematic universe) of ""superheroes"" meant to be explored in fine detail (hence the release of a TV show today... reviewing that later). It's an extremely complex world that needs to be thoroughly explained in order to deeply understand how it works, and what's everyone's role in it. This is the film's main problem: it struggles to juggle all of its different storylines and distinct characters. Even with 163min of runtime, it's impossible to squeeze in all of the necessary information.<br/><br/>So, as expected, Snyder and his team of screenwriters had to simplify, shorten, or even wholly dismiss some story elements that would only stretch the runtime to an unfathomable length. Some of the adaptations work brilliantly, but some fail to give a character its importance or offer no interest to a subplot. However, it's still easy to understand everything, and how the ending is going to unravel, which leads me to my second issue with the movie: its final act's heavy exposition.<br/><br/>Like I wrote above, there is a lot of information to deliver. What Snyder did very well was to tell most of it through flashbacks or captivating conversations, but in the final act, where everything was self-explanatory and in no need of more exposition, there is an excess of redundant dialogue that doesn't really add anything relevant. What the characters are saying is significant, yes, but we, as the audience, already know all of that way before the film's climax. It's ironic how they make a joke about villains telling their masterplan to the hero and how this villain isn't dumb enough to do it, but then proceed to carefully explain everything (that we know already) through exposition.<br/><br/>Sincerely, these are the major problems that I have with the movie. However, I love so much about everything else. From the appropriated and fun soundtracks to the beautiful production design, Zack Snyder and his crew really do a fantastic work technically. Snyder's style captures Watchmen's world perfectly. It's one of those films that carry a ""feel"" due to its stylish cinematography. I love how little CGI is actually applied (I'm obviously ignoring the big blue guy), and the abundance of practical effects and real sets that are used. The action sequences look spectacular, way better than a lot of blockbusters nowadays (10 years later!).<br/><br/>Despite the terrific technical achievements, my main compliment is actually connected to my number one problem. Even though the storylines are incredibly hard to balance, characters like Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) have extraordinarily captivating and entertaining stories. There might be a few missteps here and there, but Snyder made ONE movie from a material that's worth a whole TV show or at least two films. And he delivered a GOOD one! Probably a better job than 80% of the directors working today could ever achieve. Finally, the social commentary is still quite relevant for this new generation, and if the so-called ""source-material-purists"" didn't exist, this movie would be a lot more appreciated.<br/><br/>All in all, Watchmen is as good as it could be, having in mind it's just one film with already a long runtime. Its narrative was always going to be extremely difficult to tell in a solid yet compelling manner, and Zack Snyder does struggle with balancing all of the storylines and its characters. However, he and his phenomenal team still delivered a good flick. Technically sublime, with a distinct style, brilliant production design, and gorgeous cinematography. Characters like Rorschach and Nite Owl have amazing moments, filled with excellent action sequences, but also with emotionally powerful scenes. If it could be better? Maybe. If it could be split into two or three movies. As it stands, as one and only film, it's really impressive even with its flaws."

","THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT READ THE NOVELA.
This movie began with a brutal pg-13 fight scene which did very well without showing too much gore. I think it was the song (Unforgettable) and the shot sequences in and through the high rise apartment. Definitely a hook and sparked my interest as to the who's and why's.
Then the movie followed Rorschach- the character with the most depth (In my opinion) as he is tying together exposition
Then it carried on with slow scenes that expected us to sympathize with these characters we did not know.
Followed by some more Rorschach bold sequences.
The only ones who seemed to care about the nuclear threats were these super heroes rather than the general public who were more curious of controversy AND this could be reflective of society but it wasn't devised that way I assure you . And in the midst of all this Laurie is destroyed when she realizes that her father was actually The Comedian. Her reaction didn't ring true as she seemed more broken up about this compared to the real world nuclear risks."

","The movie is almost a word for word translation from the comic, but through a clear misunderstanding of the source material and directorial incompetancies it somehow manages to be unfaithful. Both Silk Specters are are not at all like they are in the comics, again this is without changing a word. Absolutely impressive actually. Dr Manhattan, Nite Owl, and Rorschach are done well though. Zack Snyder is a 50 year old 12 year old and any good performance given by the actors is more than likely in spite of his direction."
"nyzeenews","7","1","3","7 May 2017"," This movie is good, but has problems. Many, many problems.
","Watchmen is good. It's undeniably good. However, there are many things that keep this film from being great. These are those reasons.<br/><br/>Firstly, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach is fantastic. He gives one of the best performances in a comic book movie, such as Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Hugh Jackman as Logan, and Heath Ledger as The Joker. He is a very dark, mysterious, layered character. He is great. His character development is done so well that when he is eliminated by Dr. Manhattan, it makes you sad. He is missed(for a very short time since the movie quickly ends after). <br/><br/>Jeffery Dean Morgan as The Comedian is also really good. He is very good at playing a terrible person. The Comedian is a terrible, terrible person. He is very good at doing so. He does some pretty awful things. I assume, based on the flashbacks after these events, that he becomes a better person. Even though he is does very, very bad things, he is still somehow likable. He knows that superheroes are going out of culture and people are starting to revolt against them. The Comedian bluntly states this to Ozymandias, and gives this message to Night Owl during the aftermath of a ""we need the cops, not superheroes"" rally. The Comedian overall is pretty cool. Jeffery Dean Morgan is great. <br/><br/>Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl is good for what he's given. He is the average nice guy who just wants to help. He is like if Superman didn't have any powers and wore Batman's costume. He doesn't much stand out, he's just good. <br/><br/>Matthew Goode as Ozymandias isn't great. He's a bit bland. He doesn't really give the same amount of emotion that the comic gives him. Overall, Matthew Goode is fine. Not as good as Patrick Wilson, but not as bad as Malin Ackerman. <br/><br/>Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II is just terrible. She seems like a nice person, but she is just bland and makes me cringe. Her acting is terrible. That's all I want to say about her. <br/><br/>Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan is pretty good. He gives a very monotone performance that is perfect for his character. <br/><br/>Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre I is okay. An old whore. Nothing much. Stephan McHattie as Hollis Mason(the first Nite Owl) is also fine. <br/><br/>So my ranking of the performances go like this: 1. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach 2. Jeffery Dean Morgan as The Comedian 3. Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan 4. Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl 5. Matthew Goode as Ozymandias 6. Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II<br/><br/>The plot is split into many different sections. My ranking and explanation is as follows: 1. Rorschach's Investigation 2. The Comedian Flashbacks 3. Dr. Manhattan's Trip To Mars 4. Tie - Ozymandias' Plan/Laurie and Dan's Love<br/><br/>Rorschach's Investigations are extremely interesting and cool to watch, especially since Rorschach is the best character.<br/><br/>The Comedian Flashbacks are nice to look at how every character remembers the likable piece of crap that was The Comedian.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan's trip to Mars isn't very plot relevant but still gives some nice imagery and some insight into Manhattan's inner sorrow.<br/><br/>The tie is due to these things: Plot vs Story. Ozymandias' Plan is more plot relevant but Laurie and Dan's Love is more story driven. They both aren't great, they're just fine.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie is the comic it is based on and Zack Snyder's directing. An unpopular opinion is that the comic book graphic novel, Watchmen, is not very good. It is a averagely drawn and terribly (as least character wise) written. I think it isn't great. The movie is much better. However, Zack Snyder tried making a perfect adaptation of the comic book, that he does a pretty poor job. At least at perfectly adapting it. If Zack only took plot, character, and some iconic images from the comic and disregarded everything else, this movie could have been great.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie with a lot of problems. I very much enjoyed watching the film. I even have a handmade Rorschach costume. I'll give this movie a 7/10."

"Jithindurden","10","1","3","14 August 2016"," The greatest superhero or comic-book or graphic novel based movie
","I am someone who don't have any experience in reading Superhero comics, due to that the only Superheroes I knew about were the ones I was introduced to through Cartoon network in my childhood. Because of that I've never heard about the comics Watchmen. That's why I was this late to watch this movie.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>This movie is based on the comics Watchmen created in 1986-87 by Alan Moore and Dane Gibbons for DC comics . I think its right to call it a graphic novel for matured readers rather than calling it a Comics. Terry Gilliam thought it was unfilmable, Darren Arnofsky and Paul Greengrass tried to reinterpret the story into a contemporary time line but the studios didn't wanted that either and ultimately Zack Snyder was chosen to be the director.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The story begins in 1985 at the peak of cold war. By this time most of the superheroes are retired by the request of the government due to protests from a section of people. A retired superhero The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) gets killed in this situation. Even after the retirement of every other superheroes Rorchach (Jackie Earle Haley) who's still fighting crime as a vigilante tries to unravel the secrets behind the murder and also warn his old superhero buddies his theories about the murder. <br/><br/>Everyone in the old superhero team Watchmen were living an ordinary life . Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Mathew Goode) is a successful business man who has revealed his superhero identity to the world .The most powerful living being Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup) helps American government in many projects and stands as their biggest nuclear war power .His girl friend Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II (Maline Akerman) works along with him.Technical expert Daniel Drieberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) also lives a retired life . <br/><br/>Going through these characters we are also introduced to Minutemen the first generation of superheroes through flashbacks. <br/><br/>The mysterious story unravels conspiracies and turning points into a morally complex ending.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The depth given to each character gives the movie an extra darker edge to it. <br/><br/>We get more familiar with the Comedian through flashbacks. The Comedian who was the only superhero to be in both Watchmen and Minutemen is portrayed as a very cruel and heartless person. But even though there is no scenes trying to justify him, the viewers doesn't hate him as much for the cruelties he has done . He can be seen as a nihilistic character .<br/><br/>The name and mask of Rorschach itself shows much of his character. His mask with ever changing black and white patterns reminds the Rorschach ink blot test pictures used by psychiatrists. Rorshach is ready to go to the limits for justice.He and Comedian felt like two sides of same coin. Rorschach who will give no mercy to culprits has already left his real identity, in his mind Rorshach is the only identity he's got left .<br/><br/>Rorschach and Comedian seemed to be two people who condemn the state of the world . When Comedian embraced the darkness for the sake of an end,Rorschach fought the darkness through darker alleys .<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>There is nothing impossible for Dr Manhattan who got his super powers through an accident in between an experiment . The story becomes more of an alternate history when America uses Dr Manhattan to win the Vietnam War.America's biggest weapon in the cold war is also Dr Manhattan himself. Dr Manhattan's character contain almost every power imaginable by a human being. With his power his intellect and mindset were also grown beyond human comprehension . To think that human race is nothing at all in the universe and that there would be more peace in some other planet without any humans he must have grown into a thinking capacity of Gods .<br/><br/>Laurie who tries her best to live with a person thinking like this ultimately gets close to Daniel who liked her from the beginning<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In between all this mysteries gets unraveled and chances for a nuclear war rises.<br/><br/>Through all this we see lots of dark sides of America and how it affects the world and societies.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Just like in 300 Snyder uses comic book as the story board here .With great visual effects, we get a visual treat that stays true to neo-noir super hero movie genre . <br/><br/>-<br/><br/>In the starting credits sequence the history from the beginning of Minutemen is shown through photographs and news clips .Through that many historic incidents are referenced by slightly changing them for superheroes. A lot of famous photographs and paintings comes to our mind watching that credits .<br/><br/>In the Minutemen retirement party photo Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre I (Carla Gigino) is sitting in the middle and to her side is The Comedian . This picture is very similar to the painting of The Last Supper by Da Vinci .In the painting Jesus is sitting in the middle and many believe it is Magdalena Mary sitting right next to him , if you have seen the movie and know about the Da Vinci code you can read it together .<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>The Comedian's badge of smiley and the blood spread on it is a recurring image in the movie and it shows the mood of the movie. Amidst all the tragedies there is also comedy a twisted sense of humour."

","I cannot begin to express my thoughts about this movie. First of all i must say that i am a big comic books fan and i like most of superhero movies from either universe. So let's just say a few words about watchmen. I'll start with the cast.Jackey's(Rorschach) narration is top notch.He also did an amazing job bringing the character to life.Every other actor did equally amazing,i just mentioned Jackey since he is more like a main character. The movie is quite long but it is necessary to explain the plot.The movie unfolds like a charm. i wont spoil anything from the plot.it would be a crime.Just trust when i say it's got one of the brightest plot twists i've seen in any movies not just superhero-comic book ones. i will say nothing more.Just watch it. i feel so bad that i missed it when it was in the cinema.It's such a shame this diamond of a movie didn;t sell well."

","First of all great job to Zack Snyder for directing this movie! This was the perfect movie adaptation for the Watchmen Graphic novels. It was as if the characters were stepping out of the pages to the big screen. The Graphics of this film are absolutely stunning and gorgeous. I really enjoyed the dark and complex plot of the movie. In my opinion Rorschach and the comedian were the most interesting characters in the movie. Not everyone can understand and get the darkness of the movie and the violence might be a little to much for some people. Since the movie was a little too long, and I found some scenes between Laurie Jupiter and DR. Manhattan boring, I gave this movie an eight out of ten. But this movie is really good and I recommend it to people who like complex, dark and violent movies."

","My review of Watchmen. <br/><br/>This is based on the graphic novel by the same name, everyone back in the day imaged that this can't be done. When watching Watchmen (By the way I watched the extended edition which is nearly 4 hours) I realized that they are wrong. Most critics want you to believe that the movie is bad and on and on and on. But I liked it. The performances are petty good from the cast. They all play their part very well. This film is also directed by Zack Snyder (Man of Steel, Legend of the Guardians and 300) did a good job on this film. Special effects are not bad. And the best part of the film is when Rorschach appears in the film. That character is the reason I gave the film a score. The film is nasty as hell. Like bones are coming out and blood etc.The character I didn't like in the film is The Comedian character. He's a jerk every time I see him and the actor put a idiot performance. The story at some points doesn't make sense. Zach Snyder's old trick are in this film like slow mo. <br/><br/>Overall I loved this Movie and that's why I give this a solid, 8/10 By the way, how did I know about this movie. I remember seeing the trailer for this film when I had a holiday at Queensland in 2008. But didn't remember it in till I watch a 5 part in depth review of this film. Really got me interested. So I waited for 2-3 years to see this film and I really glad I did.<br/><br/>Thank you Geekvolution for the recommending this film for me 2-3 years ago."
"que1169","8","1","3","2 March 2015"," This was well done,
","For the most part. Definitely not like some other adaptations of printed material. Mayhap it was helped along by the fact that this was originally a graphic novel, nee comics series. In any event I applaud the directors and technicians involved. First Moore, then Gaiman, Morrison-- the UK has provided a number of artists in that medium who are in a class of their own when it comes to interpreting stories from a societal critique perspective, and mythological one, respectively. Where to begin? I don't believe it was necessary to read the GN before viewing, though it did help. Again, the story and background were well crafted to the screen, filling in much which otherwise would have been lost. Nixon's nose, oooohh the NOSE!!! LOL! All the real-life characters were well portrayed, imo. The ending, as they tend to do, was somewhat anti-climactic. But then, endings are very difficult things to pull off, even under the best of circumstances. All in all, this one is an A, perhaps -, but still top shelf. Of course, I've seen some stinkers lately, so my op is likely biased due to gratitude."

","I have watched many movies in my life but very few of them are 10/10 movies, true masterpieces - The kind that you will remember for a life time, talk about at every chance, recommend to everyone, will watch many times etc..Watchmen IS one of them. You really need to watch the director's cut of this movie in order receive the full experience. This is not your typical superhero ""blockbuster"" movie, there is a lot of violence, gore and some sex. The bullshit level is very low and most of the events are logical and make sense. <br/><br/>Watchmen does the best job in transferring how it feels like to be a superhuman that his powers and senses exceed human reality and captivity. Dr Manhattan's story will fascinate EVERY superhero enthusiasts out there, with emphasis on science/physics geeks.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder did an amazing job in transferring the comics into the big screen, the soundtrack in also incredible..3 hours of joy. A must- watch 10/10 for me!"
"bowmanblue","10","1","3","22 October 2014"," Not for everyone (but definitely for me)
","'Watchmen' is based on one of the most popular DC graphic novels of the eighties and it's been kicking about in (film) production limbo practically ever since. Many people have even gone as far as to call it 'unfilmable.' Therefore, many of its die-hard fans were sceptical when Zack Snyder took on the job of bringing it to the big screen.<br/><br/>The result: a faithful adaptation and - in my opinion - a good one. However, that doesn't mean that it hasn't attracted more than its fair share of criticism.<br/><br/>For a start, you have the fans of the graphic novel. They claim it's still not as faithful as it could have been. Yes, there are a few changes here and there which may leap out at the faithful. My counter argument is that - yes - the source material was so filled with sub-plots and excessive narrative structures, that all of it was never going to make it to the big screen. What we're given is a story that - while being complicated - is also accessible to the masses (and therefore commercially more lucrative - hopefully) and easier to follow.<br/><br/>Then you have the people who have never read the graphic novel. They may not like it because they may be expecting something else entirely. If you look at the promotional poster, you may think that you're going to watch an 'X-Men' type film, filled with lots of superheroes fighting it out with various weird and wonderful superpowers. Warning: Watchmen is NOTHING like X-Men.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a multi-stranded narrative which is more of a conspiracy-thriller-who-dunnit than an action movie (there's only two real action sequences in the whole film). Yes, the film happens to be about superheroes, trying to decide whether there's an assassin killing off their numbers one by one, but only one of the superheroes actually has superpowers (the rest are just basically good fighters in masks).<br/><br/>So, if you're expecting either an exact replica of the graphic novel, a straight out action movie, or something like X-Men, you will probably be sorely disappointed. However, if you're wanting to watch a violent, visually-stunning thriller which twists and twines while it introduces various damaged ex-heroes, give this a go. It's dark, moody and certainly different enough to be appreciated for not adhering to every superhero clichÃ© around right now. This is nothing like the 'Marvel universe' which is currently so popular!"
"Antagonisten","8","1","3","30 July 2014"," Loved it
","I can start out by saying I'm not a fan of graphic novels. It's not that I dislike them, I simply don't read them. I have tried a couple of times, but it has never been my thing. When they get transferred to the big screen though, I find them very appealing. Something about the borderland between realism and unrealism attracts me. Not always of course, but surprisingly often.<br/><br/>As you might have gathered from the above, I haven't read the Watchmen graphic novel. But I still find this movie hugely appealing. I love the different characters and I especially love the feel of the movie. I don't mind calling it poetic, and not a little nostalgic. I have to admit I'm not a fan of Zack Snyder otherwise. 300 put me to sleep with it's endless and tedious slow-motion scenes, Man of Steel violated the Superman-legacy completely. This however, is genuinely good.<br/><br/>Of course, a lot of the kudos has to go to the actors. A bunch of them are doing a bang-up job, not least Billy Crudup who has one of the more difficult roles as Dr. Manhattan.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect, there is a strange amount of gore which doesn't really fit that well with the movie in general. The plot is slightly unfocused and the ending felt slightly like a ""Meh"". But the movie is vastly enjoyable throughout, and I would rate this as one of my favorite among adaptations of graphic novels. Sin City for instance is more visually appealing and coherent, but this movie has a lot more interesting characters with more depth. I realize though that for fans of the graphic novel, this might be open to another interpretation completely. I also realize that this will not be for everyone. But I urge anyone to give it a try."

","I started watching this movie without even having heard of Watchmen. I expected this to be like the many other comic book/graphic novel movies I had seen, it certainly wasn't, it was certainly the deepest and longest I had seen. <br/><br/>An hour into the movie I was wondering if anything was going to happen, then I saw that there was still another 2 hours to go! At around the 1 hour mark, things do begin to speed up. I think the movie could have been an hour shorter if it wasn't for all the drawn-out, slow-motion scenes.<br/><br/>I had a bit of a love/hate experience with this film, there were times when I was really enjoying it, and times when I wasn't. All-in-all, it was a good movie - some level intelligence is needed to fully appreciate it though.<br/><br/>The only thing that confused me was the fact that Matthew Goode's accent starts off being American and ends off being some weird British/Russian/American mix."

","Without doubt I consider ""Watchmen"" one of the best American comic books I've ever read. I got round to reading it at the of 17 in 2009, and found that its large amounts of praise in the industry is actually pretty deserving. Alan Moore's dissection of the characters in this alternate Cold War time line has gone on to be both influential and hilariously parodied in the mediums growth. To finally see it hit the screen after hearing that it has been in development since 1986 was a dream come true, yet how well could Zack Snyder pull this off?<br/><br/>""Very well"" would be my two cents. Zack's films have always been more heavily focused on visual flair than strong narrative, and although it takes small, yet certain liberties it carries itself well throughout the movies lengthy running time. It would have been amazing to see the book's finale on the big screen, but script writer David Hayter (""X-Men"", ""X2"") does admirable service to the source material. An ""Ultimate Cut"" also incorporates the story within a story narrative, and runs at an astonishing 215 minutes. Not many comic book movies get such privilege.<br/><br/>In an alternate time line where powerless heroes fought crimes in the 1940's. Nixon won the election in the 1980's thanks to the intervention of the Vietnam war, where an individual with super powers ended it swiftly. This caused worse tensions between the Russians during the Cold War, and causes an act to be passed banning vigilantism. However, a certain paranoid anti-hero believes a conspiracy within the lines that may also involve the fate of his old allies, and could effect the overall fate of the world's situation.<br/><br/>Surprisingly dark and very well acted, the movie without doubt has some very unique set pieces. Rain drenches the city, popular music of the time blares throughout, shadows look menacing and overall every actor delivers solid performances with what they have (The movie does well at avoiding big names). I think my main concern with the movie is that a large amount of information from the book feels missing, or is overshadowed by the visual flairs and I just cannot determine whether they were suitable or not. Of course Alan Moore has been very open with his thoughts upon movie adaptations of his work, I myself hated what has been done with all of them. As of 2015, I think that Zack is a fine filmmaker who has done well working on comic book movies for the last decade. But all in all I find every narrative he has worked with underwhelming compared to his visual style, and as I said earlier I'm just at this bizarre crossroads the more I analyse and reflect back on them. I would have preferred a preference on story given this particular source material, but talents such as Terry Gilliam, Darren Aronofsky, Arnold Schwarzenegger and even Robin Williams had been approach throughout the years and somewhat had difficulty breaking down elements of the story and trying to make it work.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: The opening with the incredible rendition of Nat King Cole's ""Unforgettable"", is a stunningly well choreographed introduction I never tire of seeing. ""Watchmen"" was the best superhero film of the year, and although it didn't make large amounts of money on the original box office run, it has gained a large cult following and hopefully introduced more people to a stellar book I recommend reading. 8/10. I do not think that the book is ""Un-filmable"", and given that Hollywood seems to be rebooting everything much sooner these days, who knows what the future holds for adapting ""Watchmen""?"

","Before I start: I have seen the director's cut version, so I can only talk about that.<br/><br/>I was always curious about this Zack Snyder film, but somehow I did not watch ""Watchmen"" (haha) until now. The tone of this masterpiece is like a mixture of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Sin City"". The plot is pretty complex and diversified but not that hard to follow. The character development is very good, the directing is great (good job Mr.Snyder). The symbolic meanings are understandable for everyone (at least I think...). In my opinion this is one of those movies where the casting is perfect. Especially Jackie Earle Haley is marvelous as Rorschach but I could not imagine any other actor than Jeffrey Dean Morgan for the role of the Comedian either. Also I have to mention the soundtrack, which is also excellent. It is a really unique film with a message everybody should think about. <br/><br/>It is really hard to preoccupy the viewer for 3 and a half hours, and sometimes there are not so exciting scenes in this film too, but no that much, and even those scenes are worth watching because of the directing and the tone.<br/><br/>All in all, I think that this is one of the most underrated movies ever, and I really did not think that there could be a better comic book adaptation than ""The Dark Knight"". But I was wrong."
"mgruebel","7","1","3","7 February 2014"," Screams ""Comic Cult!""
","Having seen Watchmen twice, I must say it does not improve with age, but it does hold its own.<br/><br/>The film presents a dark urban future, with Nixon in his fourth term in a war-room that looks awfully familiar from ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and sex and death in the streets of America, and in the bars of Vietnam. WW III with Russia over the invasion of Afghanistan is imminent. Against this backdrop, an aging gang of all-too-human superheroes are getting killed one by one because they may be onto the world-salvation plan of one of their own, which has a small hitch: millions must die so billions may live. A familiar theme, also used in the more recent ""CA: The Winter Soldier.""<br/><br/>The characters are exquisitely drawn, all of them: the main ones, whose formative superhero stories we see in flash-backs. The cameos, like a hilarious Henry Kissinger who looks and talks just too much like the real thing. And the victims - of criminals and of the Watchmen, for in this film EVERYONE is a victim. I have a soft spot for ""formation and decay of superhero"" stories, so A+ for that.<br/><br/>The film makes great use of songs, and of gratuitous violence, although I don't think it quite rises to the heights of ""The Crow"" in that genre. But a film whose lead actor is killed for real in a killing scene (it was an accident, nonetheless making the Crow a Hollywood-condoned commercial snuff film) will be hard to beat on that account. I don't even think ""Watchmen"" has something to beat the cigar cutter scene at the beginning of ""Darkman."" Still, I had to cringe many times, probably at exactly the times director Zack Snyder wanted me to.<br/><br/>The film is sometimes too heavy-handed - think orgasm and flamethrower. Hitchcock pushed that one to the limit in North by Northwest, and here it went over the limit into corny territory. Some of the character motivations fall apart towards the climax. As the world's best quantum mechanic, surely Dr. Manhattan can see that every single human being, including the evil ones, is a coincidence as special as the love of his life. The film falls short of a masterpiece, but it is darn good."
"higherall7","9","1","3","4 February 2014"," An Elegy to Comic Book Mythology
","THE WATCHMEN presses all the most hallowed cultural buttons with its imagery, and even takes some of the charge off having to grow up in the optimistic sixties only to be gradually disillusioned from there on out. It is brutal and violent in a way that the Comics Code would never approve of, but it leaves no doubt that it is about the death of heroes and perhaps even the deconstruction of Modern Western Mythology. These are heavy, adult themes for a medium ostensibly advertising itself from its very beginnings as being primarily for the amusement of children. You could easily say the adults have hijacked the Comic Book medium for the sole expression of their own angst and concerns and you would not be far from right.<br/><br/>I leafed through the graphic novel by Dan Gibbons and Alan Moore, but I am afraid that the aesthetics of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee have probably prejudiced me in my view of other Comic Book universes. I found the novel dense and difficult to get through and not visually stimulating enough to compel me to make the effort. My intuitive understanding of the Comic Book medium is that the visual is the primary emotional carrier wave and the written text serves to underline and give a thought context to the action being presented. I always thought of Comic Books as storytelling on the cheap; something that was highly derivative and unashamed to borrow heavily from other mediums like film and television. But this was alright, because in it's derivative thinking it was gently pointing to deeper experiences of its subject matter once you were more mature and adult. I fondly remember the trauma of reading 'The Death of Superman' in the comic book and then discovering years later that the ending came pictorially from a movie with William Holden and Jennifer Jones entitled 'Love is a Many Splendored Thing'! <br/><br/>Zack Snyder's film version of THE WATCHMEN is satisfying to me because it makes this constant reference between the surfaces that the medium so successfully explores, and also exploits in many cases, and the darker objectives that often manipulate the display of these surfaces for mass consumption and indoctrination. Nowhere is it written that the employment of words and images must serve the aims of Manifest Destiny or cultural domination or be used to launder the dirty activities of covert operations, but in the universe of THE WATCHMEN this is implied from the first frame onward. The heroism of THE WATCHMEN is flawed and corrupt from the outset and is shown to accrue a force that eventually eats away at itself. This is not your father's Superhero Team, and we come to find out eventually that even they were not all they were cracked up to be.<br/><br/>I liked the ending merely because it makes the subtle suggestion that the truth is not to be found ultimately in the physical forces of this world, but in the voice that resides on the printed page and refuses to be stilled.<br/><br/>This is still a cliché' that I find palatable and amusing when freshly presented."
"ajping","8","1","3","9 January 2014"," Very well made but somehow much darker than the comic
","This film is extremely well done considering the difficulty in getting the beloved source material right. However, the violence and depravity of the comic was somehow manageable in print - it didn't sting as much because it was just pen and paper and words on a page. But the film brings this world fully to life and it is a disturbing universe that shocks and startles. This film overwhelms the viewer a bit as the characters confront the age-old question of ends versus means head on - is it right to save the world if you must wreak havoc to do it? Is it villainy or heroism? The Watchmen wrestle with this question - there is no answer - only a choice of which side to take or to even take sides at all."
"houseofballoons","9","1","3","3 January 2014"," A Faithful Adaptation of One of the Best Graphic Novels of All Time
","I know, I know. This film came out almost 4 years ago and I'm just writing a review now. Oh, well. For what it's worth, I saw it in theaters the first night it was released. <br/><br/>Being one of the many fans who loves Alan Moore's and David Gibbon's critically acclaimed graphic novel, I can say that this film does not disappoint me. <br/><br/>It is almost as faithful as it can be, and yes, I believe that to be a positive thing. <br/><br/>""Watchmen"" was a very polarizing film for most people. I don't think I came across one person who said ""it was alright"". It was either ""awesome"" or ""it sucked."" I was the former. Having not watched it since 2009, I put it in over the holidays, and my opinion of the film didn't change.<br/><br/>Snyder's knowledge of the source material is obvious, and I prefer this to his latest comic book outing (Man of Steel)<br/><br/>The standout for me is definitely Jackie Earle Haley's performance. I mean, how do you capture Walter Kovacs? How do you manage to portray Rorschach as well as he did? A very great performance that deserved a lot more credit in my opinion. <br/><br/>Make no joke about it - this film is dark, violent and, once again, dark. It's not for everyone, and I can see why some people may have disliked it, especially considering most people probably went in thinking ""Oh! A superhero film! Looks fun!"" Plus all the promotional posters may have lead you to believe it was a superhero film. It's not. It's a vigilante film, and one that is a lot better than people seem to think. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Snyder catches the world of ""Watchmen"" perfectly, and Haley's Rorschach is something to behold, in what has got to be the best possible adaptation of Watchmen you could have envisioned."

","For decades, comic books have offered an insightful view on how superheroes and masked vigilantes could impact society. Yes, they help wipe out crime on the street level, but what then? What happens when the super villains emerge? What happens when countries go to war? What happens when the human race treads across the edge of oblivion, and can only be saved by making hard decisions that normal people can't make? The Watchmen comic was published to show an alternate 1985, where history is severely altered by the presence of such heroes. A film adaptation was in the works as far back as 1986, but scriptwriting and budgeting issues would make it an unfeasible project until 2009.<br/><br/>To fully encapsulate the broad scope and scale of the story, this film runs for well over two and a half hours (or, a full three hours for the director's cut, three and a half for the ultimate cut). Action occurs in short sporadic bursts, but is never really the film's highlight. It's a drama for the most part, but it is a stylish and evenly-paced one. The imagery is often really fantastic and impressive. The character conflicts and discoveries drive most of the picture, building a coherent mystery and plenty of psychological dynamics. Even though this superhero movie doesn't have a whole lot of super action, it is consistently engaging.<br/><br/>The story follows the original comic practically word-for-word and frame-by-frame, save for a few small changes (most of which involves the ending, which some fans have criticized for ""missing the point"" of Alan Moore's work). The downside to adapting the story so closely is that the film doesn't really add or expand on much creatively, and the most critical of viewers would say that the filmmakers have made something flat and lifeless out of the material.<br/><br/>As for myself, I was always intrigued by the story, and I believe all the strengths of the comic are effectively ported over into the film. The plot gets a little random, but it all builds up to an interesting anticlimax that offers some really challenging ideas of morality and ethics, especially by superhero standards. Throughout the picture, themes of human nature permeate strongly, always hinting at the darkest, most violent, most primal, and most self-destructive aspects of society. Parts of the film are quite grisly and violent this way, and it makes for a really dark and bleak experience. This film features a plethora of interesting characters, each with their own unique characteristics, backgrounds, and issues.<br/><br/>This film uses very stylish photography. Slow-motion effects are used quite liberally. Other times, the film uses some really cool camera moves and angles. Editing is solid. Acting is generally good: the entire cast does their best to bring the comic's characters to life. Writing follows the comic very closely, and is generally good in spite of that. This production uses quality sets, props, costumes, and awesome special effects. Music is really distinctive too.<br/><br/>Aside from the theatrical cut of the film, there is a director's cut available on DVD and Blu-Ray, which offers twenty-four minutes of new scenes that are seamlessly cut into the feature, and do add a little more to the story and characters. The ultimate cut is also available, which includes the Tales of the Black Freighter cartoon cut into the film, to best represent the original comic.<br/><br/>This film is a very close adaptation of the Watchmen comic, and that is both the film's blessing and curse, ultimately making it a love-it-or-hate-it film. I personally love it, because I love watching the story unfold with such vivid visuals on screen. It is a dark and cerebral experience that few, if any, other superhero films can offer.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"

","The great masterpiece of comic books by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ""Watchmen"": the great revolution of comics in the 80's giving the world a darker and mature vision of ""Heroes"", can truly be Zack Snyder's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Zack, with the help of David Hayter and Alex Tse (writers) could bring ""Watchmen"" to the big screen in an impressive way. The story of 12 chapters, about a world where superheroes really exist since 1930, all of them taking as inspiration the hero Superman. Each with their own abilities and ""powers"". In this world, the U.S. won the Vietnam War thanks to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) the most powerful of all heroes, powers to controls the atoms (this means he control everything), he is considered by world's population one true God. After that and the third re-election to the presidency of Nixon, the police begins to strike and civil unrest against masked vigilantes. With that Nixon is forced to sign the Keene Act in 1977 which consisted of all ""costumed adventurers"" to register with the government. With this most vigilantes decided to retire, some revealing their secret identities mostly to win cash thanks to the media's attention, that was the case of Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), the ""Ozymandias."" Others, such as ""Comedian"" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and ""Dr. Manhattan"", continued to work under the supervision and control of the government. The vigilante known as Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), however, has operated as a renegade hero and out-of-law, frequently pursued by police.<br/><br/>Years passed and the cold war ravaging the world, ""The Comedian"" (the hero most despised of all) is found dead in his house, having his secret identity being revealed. This draws attention to Rorschach begins contacting his former colleagues for clues, considering almost everyone as possible suspects.<br/><br/>All 12 chapters were transported in an impressive way to the cinema, the Adaptation of Snyder is fantastic and can be very loyal to the comic. The entire cast was perfectly chosen for the heroes, all with excellent performances, but who stands out for me is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He was always my favorite character and the film also manages to show me this, Rorschach is more BADASS than ever was, as the movie it-self, not only Badass (as most of Snyder's movies) but it manages to be the best adaptation from a comic to the screen ever made! P.S: Do not even know why that Alan Moore says he does not like the movie (or even seeing), saying that his work had been ruined, it seems that Dave Gibbons was the only one to congratulate Snyder and his Excellent work."

It explores morality and spiritual thinking properly. Watch it at least once.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>The film will appeal most to Adolescents. It has action, sex, philosophy and questions about morality. The beauty of the film lies in its slow motion editing. I loved the cinematography too. The ambiance of the film is so nice that you definitely will feel that it is some kind of an alternate time. Praise to the art director. The songs used in the film are more compelling than the soundtracks. The character of Rorshack will remain unforgettable always. The running time is a little too much but then you will bond with the characters nicely because of this. Ending was unexpected and never thought it would be like this. Hats off to Zack Snyder for the masterpieces like 300 and this he has given.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Truth should be overlooked sometimes."" <br/><br/>VERDICT: ""Most recommended."""

But two recent re-viewings provoke the same odd attention from me as did The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: There be Acting here.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley is superb as a masked vigilante who feels faceless without the mask. Given what she has to play off of, Malin Ackerman keeps your attention throughout...sometimes that's all that's needed...and her scenes with a crudely made-up Carla Gugino remain special. And given what the FX crews do to him Billy Crudup's portrayal of a godlike being is singular and striking.<br/><br/>Matthew Goode is spot-on as The Man Who Has Everything (If No One Interferes). Patrick Wilson is quietly hilarious as a conflicted and at times distracted Clark Kent who truly needs ""the suit"".

","First off, during my first viewing of Watchmen, I hadn't read the graphic novel beforehand. A big mistake on my part, but I thought the film was great anyway. I watched it twice more and my opinion hadn't changed, even after both the mix of overwhelmingly positive feedback and the negative backlash. I know a lot of people complaining about how ""boring"" the movie was, and how much they couldn't get the infamous blue penis out of their mind. Their opinions didn't phase me, they had no appreciation for true cinema. I mean, these are the same brainless automatons that gave praise to X-Men Origins: Wolverine and 2012. One day, whilst spending time with my girlfriend at the mall, I stopped at Borders to check out some novels, comics, and manga. There I saw it, amusingly enough, adjacent to V for Vandetta (another comic that had a film adaptation I really enjoyed). I bought the graphic novel and was amazed how thoroughly the movie adapted the comic (for the most part).<br/><br/>The casting is extraordinary, its like the characters stepped out from the comic, into live-action. Major kudos goes to Billy Crudup's performance as Dr. Manhattan (of course named after The Manhattan Project which gave birth to the A-BOMB), and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Silk Spectre II could honestly be played by numerous actresses, she isn't very deep, I was glad that she was a little more cheerful for the film, whereas in the comic all she did was complain. Patrick Wilson was great as Nite Owl II, not much to say besides that, and Matthew Goode gave a surprisingly solid performance as Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias) despite his (lack of) physique.<br/><br/>Of course the movie had to take out certain elements, but to be honest, some of those elements weren't necessary for the film (i.e. The Tales of the Black Freighter, the ""alien""). The only major disappointment to me was the exclusion of Hollis Mason's murder by the Knot-Tops. I also wish Veidt had more screen time than he did. Though I understand why certain things were cut to meet demand. But wait! There was a solution to that issue anyway, after I read the graphic novel, I bought The Ultimate Cut on DVD. I was astonished by all the things they included that were missing the first time around. I mean, the original cut was about 2 hours, 42 minutes. The Ultimate Cut however, is about 3 hours, 35 minutes. The Tales of the Black Freighter subplot, the Knot-Tops, Hollis Mason's end, and overall a lot of extended scenes helped the overall impact, and The Ultimate Cut is the true film in my opinion. Watchmen is the ""Citizen Kane"" of comic book films, in competition with The Dark Knight and V for Vandetta before it. This is also competing with my choice for favorite movie of all time."
"DragoonKain","10","1","3","20 August 2010"," The Ultimate Edition is A Lot Better
","I first reviewed this movie after having seen it in theaters in March of 2009 when it was first released. I had a mixed reaction to it. On the one hand, I loved how faithful Snyder was to the source material. But on the other, in trying to squeeze all 12 issues of the comic book series into a single movie, the film felt strangely paced, and seemed to lose a lot of viewers who weren't already familiar with the source material.<br/><br/>Since that time, three different versions of this film have been released on DVD and Bluray. The theatrical cut, which is the shortest version, and by shortest I mean 2 hours and 40 minutes. This is the version shown in theaters, and the version most people reviewed. At the same time, they also released a 3 hour long Director's Cut. The Director's Cut added a few nice scenes that improve the movie somewhat, but don't really improve the pacing, which still has the problem of feeling like an episodic story told awkwardly as a single film.<br/><br/>Several months later, however, a third cut of the film was released. This one, called the Ultimate Cut, is over 3 and a half hours long and includes an animated version of the graphic novel's comic within a comic ""Tales of the Black Freighter"", a pirate comic that mirrors the struggle of the main characters of The Watchmen. Ironically the addition of these animated segments, that periodically interrupt the flow of the main storyline, actually improve the pacing the film.<br/><br/>Whereas the previous cuts felt more like slow plodding action movies that often lost itself in its exposition, the Ultimate cut doesn't feel like an action movie at all, and instead feels more like a philosophical deconstruction of our own moralities and commonly held beliefs. This is closer to what Alan Moore had in mind when he wrote the series, and the Ultimate Cut captures this essence, where the original theatrical version and Director's Cut fell short.<br/><br/>The movie is brilliant, mainly because the graphic novel is brilliant. Moore's writing, influenced by Nietzsche's ideas of existentialism, is beautifully worded, and Snyder was wise to stay as close to the source material as he did. There are a few minor flaws, mainly the scenes with the Silk Spectre, whose acting was good, but did not measure up to the task. Also, I didn't like the vomiting scene cutting into the beautiful ""Sound of Silence"" funeral procession. But these are minor nitpicks that are more than made up for by a brilliantly crafted and well paced film.<br/><br/>I have to give this a 10/10, a great improvement over my initial reaction to the theatrical cut. It's too bad this wasn't the version released in theaters, it may have gotten a better critical reception. But then again, I'm not sure many would have been able to sit through a 3 and a half hour movie."

","I never read the graphic novel, but I've seen the film several times now and I can hardly get enough of it. For those of you unaware of the plot, it is a compelling film noir mystery thriller about a group of people who become superheroes, are then used by the US government to fight its enemies and are later discarded by the US government. One of the group was murdered and the others start investigating we he had to die.<br/><br/>Interesting about the back story is that both the socio-political climate and characters are well-developed and realistic. The use of superheroes by the US allowed the Sovjetunion and US to become more polarized than in our reality, making the US government far more conservative and bringing the world very close to nuclear holocaust. The superheroes all have their own unique character traits, each based on real and flawed human beings like I've met in my own life. What's most interesting about the plot of Watchmen is the way these different personalities interact with one another and how they set themselves apart from the rest of humanity.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from other films, however, is an audiovisual style few people besides Zack Snyder could actually pull off. The visuals are simply breathtaking throughout the entire film and the audio adds to the atmosphere the way only a few other films can. Watching the film, I feel immersed in a surreal dream and the first time I sat glued to my chair for the entire duration because of the sheer beauty of the visuals, the interesting plot and the fascinating characters.<br/><br/>Maybe the graphic novel was even more compelling as the film plot-wise, I don't think anyone could have done a better job making a film based on the graphic novel. Please remember that graphic novel and film are two different media and you'll never be able to tell the entire story of a multiple edition graphic novel into a single film, however you'll also never be able to control the pacing, acting and soundtrack of a graphic novel. It is my opinion that those who didn't like this film either ignore the differences between the two different media and are frustrated by the film straying from the graphic novel more often than they would like or simply didn't get the story and lost interest due to their confusion. After seeing this film several time, I can't really find anything not to like about this film, which is why I give it a maximum score (something I rarely do)."

","A friend of mine had been so disappointed by this one that he wrote so as to spare me from wasting the cost of a cinema ticket and three hours of my life! Having finally caught up with it myself, I could not disagree with him more – not just that but, due to the film's essentially muddled plot line (despite an overgenerous running-time of 162 minutes), I even went so far as to acquire the mammoth 215-minute ""Ultimate Cut"" of the film immediately afterwards! To me, this is easily one of the better among the recent flood of comic-strip-inspired blockbusters – with, unsurprisingly, perhaps the one to have the biggest heart. Given Heath Ledger's somewhat over-hyped performance as The Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT (2008), Jackie Earle Haley's turn as Rorschach here (with his classic faceless, yet sentient, mask and mouthing the film's one outstanding line to a bunch of angry jailbirds i.e. ""You don't seem to understand: I'm not locked in here with you – you're locked in here with me!"") proved no less memorable or genre-defining. Incidentally, before the project was announced, I had no prior knowledge of the source material (let alone its quasi-legendary status) – so there were no preconceptions about the rigorousness (or not) of the adaptation involved on my part (the result features both uncompromising violence and surprising, albeit vaguely laughable, sex scenes). By the way, having watched all three of Snyder's films (again, this is clearly superior to the others), I would like to see him tackle an original subject next – since DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) was obviously a remake (of a horror title held in very high regard by many, though not myself!) and 300 (2007) was both that (of the 1962 Rudolph Mate' spectacular) and, like WATCHMEN itself, a cinematic rendition of a graphic novel. What I really liked about this one is its blending of outright fantasy (apart from the typical sci-fi elements of a scientist rendered superhuman in a freak lab accident, there is the gleeful re-write of history – where, among other things, America has not only emerged victorious in the infamous Vietnam conflict but Richard Nixon is still 'serving' as U.S. President in 1985!) with an oppressive noir mood (in which the volatile, cynical Rorschach operates – traded in the climax for an equally forbidding icy wasteland). Also notable is its expert use of music (bafflingly criticized by some) highlighting giants in the field such as Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Leonard Cohen and the intricate but admirably fluid editing wherein, at various points, an incident recalls some past event of particular import. Though, at first, I felt this was going to be undercast, most of the actors involved (many of them new faces to me) acquitted themselves well enough under the circumstances – including Malin Akerman as the sensuous Silk Spectre II and Matthew Goode as the deceptively anodyne Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (who seem to have received the lion's share of the flak in this regard). That said, another aspect which was not properly defined here for the uninformed is the individual quality of each 'superhero' (for instance, the Jeffrey Dean Morgan character known as ""The Comedian"" is quite the antithesis to what is expected of one, even if only Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan – nobly bearing the potential hilarity of his naked blue appearance[!] – is really prodigious in the normal sense). A dense, dazzling and surprisingly satisfactory effort, then, but one that actually leaves the viewer asking for morewhich is why I took the, for me, incongruous plunge of getting hold of an even longer version."
"tubby1","7","1","3","1 January 2010"," Watch the time
","Jack Snyder has created a well-crafted if overly-long film with Watchmen. The artistic and glossy comic book style are well delivered and the performances are on the whole good. However, it embellishes characters too much when the film could have been cut or more time provided to drive the story.<br/><br/>The opening credits are wonderfully produced to bring a quick but timely impression on the background to the film we are to follow. There is no denying Snyder's flair and all-round artistic quality in this sequence and throughout Watchmen.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley is the star performer as Rorschach with a bitter and violent edginess. For me Watchmen spends too much time in its own self-pity, wallowing in the bleakness of the world. Characters are introduced but are dragged out to long when more exposition should have been given to driving the plot. The unfortunate 'love-triangle' is a ticking hindrance to the story and may have been a cinematic tool to provide a respite from the bleakness.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a dark and brooding film with great artistic and creative merit. However, Watchmen kind of gets caught up in its narrative a little too much, and this is its achilles heel."

","The most loved Graphic novel of all time is brought to the big screen. Not all of it makes it but most. The ending is changed but it's still keeping the theme. The only way to comment on this film is to view all of it. So.<br/><br/>The writing was correct all of it was there. The directing was strong. Emphasis on creating a mood. The costumes were garish and mouldy at the same time. Which was what the comic was all about. The score was superb creating sorrow and heroism at the same time. The soundtrack featuring the original version of Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen. And more oldies for everyone to enjoy. The sets were spot on. Pause every shot to get a view of all the little stuff there. A reference to everything. The visual effects, lighting and camera work were steady and great creating the mood. Everyone was on top form. Which brings me to.<br/><br/>Acting.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the book. And the film was great. Crudup as Manhattan was great i believed he was perfectly cast. His voice was as i imagined it to be. Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman as Nite Owl 2 and Silk Spectre 2 were brilliant there odd romance was something quite fresh from the whole Peter Parker/Mary-Jane Watson thing. Carla Gugino and Steven Mchattie as the original Nite owl ans Silk Spectre were brilliant as i love them as actors. I must comment on how good Mathew Goode was at playing Ozzymandias my least favourite of all the characters.The army folk were good as were all the smaller roles. Helping build the world. But really i have to give most acting credit to.<br/><br/>Jeffery Dean Morgan as The Comedian. Fantastic. He was funny. He was sad. We actually felt sorry for him which you don't really do with arseholes. But he worked wonders.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Hayley as Rorschach. To understand how it works you have to see it. He is fantastic seriously.<br/><br/>GO OUT AND WATCH IT!"
"wladimir_a","9","1","3","2 December 2009"," You did a great job Zack
","First of all I have to say that I'm one of the biggest fans of the graphic novel, that's why I think this movie would be a monumental effort to being faithful to the book, a task impossible to many directors out there (say, great director Terry Gilliam was attached once to this project) plus you know that geeky fans ALWAYS are impossible to please, but no for Zack Snyder, in this movie everything fits like a glove, specially the actors that were chosen, I really enjoyed each and every performance ( specially J.E. Haley as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl). IMO Zack Snyder did a great job, he did what a good movie director does: adapt a great material into a movie, like say, Pete Jackson did with LoTR. Forget League of the Xtraordinary Gent or V for Vendetta, like Alan said that was pure merchandising crap, if some graphic novel or comic book needs to be translated to a movie Zack Snyder is your man, even I could dare to say that Alan would enjoy this adaptation of his awesome workgreat job Zack."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","3","30 November 2009"," As Good As Anyone Could Expect It To Be.
","Given the variable quality of recent super-hero screen adaptations – from adequate to incompetent – this big, bold version of Alan Moore's legendary comic book is as good as anyone could realistically expect it to be. I read the compilation comic book (called a 'graphic novel' so that grown-ups didn't have to feel embarrassed about buying it) more than 20 years ago and was impressed by its sour, jaundiced view of the world – but then, I was only in my early twenties. And while I was impressed, I came away still thinking it was a good comic book and nothing more. Certainly no literary work of genius as some would have us believe. The makers here were left with something of a quandary: stay faithful to the book and you please the fans but get destroyed by the critics; make it more appealing and understandable to an audience with no knowledge of the book and you won't be able to hear the critic's praise over the howls of protest from the fans. Thankfully, they stayed (mostly) faithful to the book – even Rorshach's clipped way of speaking is retained.<br/><br/>As I prefer film to cartoons, I prefer the film to the graphic novel. The film can – and does – create a depth of mood and atmosphere that the comic book has no hope of matching, and as I watched the terrific opening shots of an alternative past unfolding beneath the credits I started feeling really pleased I'd bothered to pick up a copy of the DVD. For the most part, the characters in Snyder's film (and until now I've considered him highly over-rated) are no cartoons come to life but real flesh and blood characters. They're not deep, full-rounded characters, admittedly, but they at least have a measure of depth lacking from comparable flicks. The film retains the dark, noirish atmosphere of the comic, and even though it's a long time since I read the comic, I'm pretty sure that many shots are exact replicas of the comic-book panels they're adapting.<br/><br/>The violence, while difficult to take at times, is also in keeping with the comic – where gory scenes of mutilation can never be as shocking as when it's recreated on celluloid – and it's again credit to the makers that they didn't bow to the inevitable pressure to tone things down in order to get a lower age classification rating and so boost their profits. Remove the violence and you remove the guts of the story and all you're left with is a companion piece to the adventures of Peter Parker.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book you're probably initially going to struggle to understand what's going on – even though the film takes a long time filling in the back-story (which is why the running time is so long). Sadly, in this age of the post-MTV generation, this means a level of patience is required on the part of the audience that may be beyond the capabilities of some. However, if you've read the book, I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy this. Let's just hope there isn't a Watchmen II"
"miscellaneous411","6","1","3","19 October 2009"," Almost Perfect, One Big Silly Flaw
","This filmmaker seems to have made the same grave error in judgment that he did with The 300.<br/><br/>As others have stated, so eloquently, this screenplay is filmed beautifully, with rich depth and darkness that captivates the viewer from the opening scene. It could have reached heights of classic and epic proportions...but it had to include that silly gratuitous sex scene. Seriously? Like The 300, Watchmen could have maintained its integrity WITHOUT that 3 minutes of laughable nonsense. It did NOT need a sex scene at all, especially one so blatantly cheesy. This kind of immature approach will keep his films out of the Oscars and archives as true classics.<br/><br/>What a shame to have an otherwise stunning piece of work bruised and therefore ruined by such an amateur misjudgment."
"bobmichelga","10","1","3","25 September 2009"," A deeper, more mature comic book film
","Having read the novel not long before seeing the film for the first time, I approached Watchmen with very high expectations and it certainly didn’t disappoint. While some may get hung up on plot changes or complexity, I think it’s worth remembering what the film needs to do. Plot changes come because some things in the original material just wouldn’t work as a film, and so Director, Zack Snyder, altered it to fit its new medium. Complexity is down to the original writer, Alan Moore, who is renowned for his very complex and unconventional story lines.<br/><br/>Watchmen is set in an alternate history, which disbands from our own around 1940, when in the Watchmen universe, the world saw its first masked heroes. Instead of approaching superheroes in the way we expect where there’s a wide margin between good and evil, where the heroes are praised and the villains get their comeuppance, Watchmen treats its heroes in a way which is more like the real world would.<br/><br/>This film shouldn’t be approached by those who are looking for yet-another-comic-book-film, but by those who are looking for a deeper and more unexpected plot like that of the Matrix or Fight Club – you’re not greeted by scene after scene of action as you would expect, but more by a series of questions given to you as the plot twists almost constantly.<br/><br/>For the most part, brilliant cinematography is accompanied by a spectacular choice of songs; an absolute highlight is a montage towards the beginning of the film which outlines a brief history of what has lead to the present to the tune of “The Times They Are A-Changin’” by Bob Dylan. This is, quite frankly, one of the most mind blowing pieces of cinema which I’ve seen to date, it sent a shiver down my spine.<br/><br/>As wonderful as this film is, a huge amount of credit has to go to the original writer, Alan Moore, whose storytelling ability is critically acclaimed, and has been for many years. That said, no superhero film has ever been done in quite such a mature, groundbreaking and fascinating way as Watchmen. While writing this review I’ve had it playing on the TV to my right and it’s taken quite a lot to draw myself from it."
"RichardKleiner","10","1","3","21 September 2009"," Not your average group of Super Friends
","Several critics who have read the comic book series have made an endeavor to dismiss this movie as an over-reverent praise to the source material without doing anything new. And while that has been rather accurate for those who have actually read the comics, I'm part of a narrow margin of individuals who not only didn't read the comics, but didn't even have the resources to buy such an expensive limited series. So I'm writing this comment with no prior knowledge of the story. <br/><br/>Set in an alternate storyline, the story focuses on what would happen to the United States politics and sociology had costumed vigilantes would actually existed. And so, this is not your family-friendly superhero story, where the good guys and the bad guys are easily differentiated and the consequences of their heroic deeds are always rewarding and lauded.<br/><br/>Some people hoping for an action ride may be disappointed with the film's pacing, as it's primarily a mystery plot, starting with the brutal assassination of former vigilante, The Comedian. As the mystery unravels, we learn back stories, motivations and events that are pertinent to each of the Watchmen: Rorscharch, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre Dr. Manhattan, Ozzymandias and The late Comedian. This, in turn, makes an even more complex set of superheroes than your average super friends. With just one glimpse of The Comedian's back story, you'll begin to wonder how on earth did this man can be considered a hero. I mean, he assassinated JFK. <br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan, although the second coolest character, is quite inexpressive. But that's justified as he grows more detached to human emotion, including empathy, resulting in an ultra-powerful being but a flawed protector that has lost its faith in humanity.<br/><br/>By far, my favorite character is Rorschach. His mask already has a personality, and his twisted but morally accurate sense of justice make him the most interesting character. Without his mask, or his ""real"" face, he isn't that fascinating. He still is cool, with a particular line ""I'm not locked in here with you, You're locked in here with me"".<br/><br/>Nite Owl was also a great character, but Silk Spectre II was rather expendable. SPOILER: Her importance came when it is revealed she is The Comedian's Daughter, even as her mother was raped by him earlier. Even with this, though quite hot, this female character didn't achieve much other than staying with Nite Owl, in a totally impertinent and unnecessary sex scene, which is done exquisitely, by the way.<br/><br/>The movie most certainly is not boring, as the action is there, though it starts late. Highlights are some quite graphic fight scenes. Just saying that several bones are broken on screen in various sequences can warn over-sensitive eyes. Also, the sight of a man being poured hot oil all over him (while seeing his burning skin) and a goofy fat man having his arms sawed off (I kid you not), this may turn off quite a percentage of the movie going demographics, but that's the way real comic books are now. Again, not your average super friends.<br/><br/>Still, by the time you get to the ending, where the conspiracy is unmasked, it's all worth while. The morality contest that ensues between the always justice seeker Rorschach and the intimidatingly brilliant Ozzymandias' plan for a better good is truly a controversial but enlightening one.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the other characters are not interesting either. Facts abound about several characters and some important events from the comic book that were edited out of the picture, but it's commendable with the amount of footage they managed to include in the final cut.<br/><br/>The soliloquies may be overbearing if you're not aware that comic books are mostly narrated this way. Besides, this is one of those movies where most anything the characters say can turn into a memorable quote. ""I will say: No"". ""I can't see the whole future, just my own"". As for the performances, coming from a cast of unknowns, they're really good. They don't touch the realm of average. They're miles above average. The only known face I remember is ""Mickey"" from Seinfeld, which was a pleasant surprise. Even he delivers an excellent performance.<br/><br/>Needless to say that the visuals are impressive. The comic book frames in the big screen make twice the edgy effect.<br/><br/>The political dialog and references can seem like your classic college anarchist essay, but the political scenario is so properly constructed that it's truly the work of a visionary. Not just a philosopher, but a true scholar.<br/><br/>As much as this revolutionary piece of film is wonderful, 80% of the credit has to go to Dave Gibbon's graphics, and most especially, Alan Moore's brilliant storytelling. And while that remaining 20% could go to Zach Snyder's religiously respectful directorial effort, it should really go to the execs and producers that green lighted the project with Snyder's proved style in mind. Instead of altering the story to their likes, they really let the filmmakers do their thing. And the filmmakers have the better vision and intentions.<br/><br/>No superhero was, is or will be as fascinating, mature and groundbreaking as Watchmen. They're most certainly not your average super friends."

I have seen a LOT of movies, drama and fantasy are 2 of my favourite genres, and this one has both of them in such quantities that it's hard to describe. In few words, this movie is the best and the most truthful fantasy movie i've ever seen. Many will say i've seen only a couple of movies - I don't care about their opinion. I'm just saying what I feel about this movie at the moment I've finished watching it, and the feelings are strong. The main thing in a movie for me is the story and the byplay, and this one has got them both so true I almost cried."
"joshi_3592","Null","1","3","27 August 2009"," The story was great, but the filmatisation was not very good.
","I've decided not to rate this film at all. I would personally call it a film that can neither be seen as a success or a failure. The story was great, but the filmatisation was not very good.<br/><br/>The story really captivated me, each character represented one of the many sides of the human race, and they all handled the world in they're own way. No ones way was neither the right or the wrong way to do it. And in the end, although you can question they're means of accomplishing it, they succeeded in world peace.<br/><br/>The characters were both dark and deep, and they were all different form each other, they were both friends and enemies. The comedian was the dark side of humanity, he realized its true face, and took it with a smile and humour. Rorschack was the bad cop character, he had no mercy for evil, and punished it with they're own brutality. NiteOwl was the good cop, a mixture of Clark Kent and Batman, he was the boy scout, and followed the rules. Dr. Manhattan, was the godlike character, he perceives existence in a different way and he struggles to understand humanity in his new form. And he fails to see if a brutal and corrupt world is worth saving. Silk Spectre, I didn't quite catch, She just seemed to be the person that kept lurking into past events, which eventually led to convincing the Watchmen to reunite. Perhaps she was the consciousness and heart of the story, eventually bringing them all together. <br/><br/>Despite good characters and philosophy, I personally didn't think the 'film' itself was any good. I liked ""300"" but this film was slaughtered by Zack Snyders unique directing. The movie was to focused around violence, gore, sex, and slow motion effects. Not only were several scenes uncomfortable to watch, but all in all it took away the attention from the main story. It had its good moments but I felt it was watered out in an exaggerated attempt to make the film ""cool"" and action packed. Maybe a re-cut and a slightly censored version had been better, but the film we have now doesn't give credit to the real story.<br/><br/>So I have no rating and I can simply say I liked the Watchmen, but I didn't like the film itself.."

","I read Watchmen 6 years ago, and absolutely loved it. I had heard through the websites that the movie was going to be made, but never thought that it would happen. Then I saw the preview at ""The Dark Knight"", and I knew it would be pretty close to the novel.<br/><br/>Now I've finally seen the movie, what I can say is this: Great rendition of the novel, but the appeal that the graphic novel had is still lost on screen. Watchmen the novel took what we who read comics knew as convention and spun it on its head, while taking a piece on how superheroes would function in ""the real world"", and presented the adult themes in comics, with a lot of ""annotations"" and symbolism. Watchmen the movie pretty much took the functionality part of it, while portraying superheroes as semi-flawed (which the novel does); however, these ideas have already been made into movies (maybe not good ones, but it's been done). The result is the audiobook equivalent of the graphic novel--one person's abridged interpretation of a masterpiece. Now, to give the movie credit, the effects are beautiful, and the acting (esp. Jackie Haley as Rorsharch) is good; heck, even the climax/end is more plausible/convincing than the novel's. However, as I watch this movie, I think that if this had been made 20 years before, it would have been to movies what the graphic novel was to comics. Definitely nice watch, but not earthshattering."
"MrHarley","8","1","3","10 August 2009"," It's not an action flick - but it is a very watchable hybrid of SF and film noir with actual character development!
","I never read the original graphic novel, but I lived through the period covered by the film as a child and then a young adult. They have the seventies and eighties, and an alternate believable history, down very well. They look at the impact that have a living a breathing Superman level superhero might have had on the world of that time, and they do it very well.<br/><br/>Don't expect and action flick, nor your typical ""superhero"" movie. If you do, you are going to be disappointed. Most of the characters are ""Batman"" level superheroes, not the Fantastic Four or the Hulk. This is more a cross between film noir, alternate history with a touch of Science Fiction, and a film on the human condition. It is incredibly violent at times, and it feels like a couple of the scenes were added just for the action. Sort of like comic relief, they keep the film from feeling totally claustrophobic. They avoid the utter hopelessness of Blade Runner. Then again, that is one of my favorite films.<br/><br/>The movie is more about personalities, and both about being human and the extremes. Two of the main characters represent the extremes of the human condition, and it is interested to see how the film develops both. Even though the ""happy"" ending scene may serve to hide it, the film is very much a classic tragedy. The ending begs for a sequel, along the lines of ""be careful what you wish for."" If there is sequel by the same writing/directing team, I'll go to see that one at the theater."

","First of all I would like to inform you that as soon as I saw the trailer for Watchmen, I located the graphic novel and started reading it. The novel was by far one of the most intriguing I have read in a long time, save Hellblazer and Sin City. Halfway through I realized that I must watch the movie and so I discarded the novel, lest it spoil my movie experience. I must say that they have stuck to the theme of the Novel, the movie is equally Noirish and sinister. The casting was spot on, even the dialogs were exactly as they were in the novel. That is a good thing because in keeping with the spirit of the graphic novel, they have done a measurable amount of Justice to 'the Watchmen'. Toning down or adding anything more to it would've made it a far less satisfying experience. I appreciate it when Directors do not compromise on the levels of gore, profanity and nudity to be shown on screen. I just hate it when compromises are made. Thankfully, with 'watchmen' none were made. My advise is first see the movie then read the Graphic novel."

","Few days back I watched the movie ""Watchmen"". I had picked that movie purely for lack of other choices because I didn't want to see another super hero movie. To my pleasant surprise I loved this movie.<br/><br/>To start with, I was taken-in with the concept that all the super heroes no more than mortal humans with imperfections embedded in them. They were mere vigilantes dressed up in funny costumes. There is of course one exception to them, Dr Manhatten, who out of an accident in a nuclear laboratory becomes something of a super human with quantum mechanical powers.<br/><br/>To truly love this movie you need to have some knowledge of 1970-1980 history. You need to know about President Richard Nixon, Secretary Henry Kissinger, the cold war tension between US and then USSR and about the Vietnam war. You also need to have some idea of quantum mechanics. The movie stands out from rest of super hero movies in its portrayal of characters. There is no evil-minded villain from whom the heroes have to rescue the world. The heroes do not subscribe to the idea that every human life is equally valuable. But they all in general try to have rational and moral view of their own albeit the minor differences in opinion. Although I would not totally agree with the ending, I would still prefer such an ending to a run-of-the mill childish super-hero saved the day ending.<br/><br/>To summarize, the movie is not for the regular super-man or spider-man loving fans. This is for somewhat more rational fans who are perfectly OK to accept imperfections in their heroes."
"rsa5387","9","1","3","29 July 2009"," Good Adaption...Brilliant Film
","An adaptation of a highly influential graphic novel, touted as the best of all time, certainly has a lofty set of expectations to meet when being adapted into a film. Whether it is an inferior product to the novel is debatable, in any case, Zack Snyder mostly succeeds in adapting Watchmen into an incredibly daring, thought-provoking, entertaining film. Turning the traditional superhero story on its head, it's one of those rare comic-book translations that diverts from merely an entertaining action movie into a real piece of cinema. The acting, dialogue, and cinematography are outstanding. The dialogue, especially, hits all the right notes. While the best are certainly reserved for Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan, the rest of the cast get their bits with some hard-hitting dialogue of their own. The exceptional acting, especially by Walter Kovacs (Rorschach), Billy Crudup (Dr. Manhattan), and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian) create the believability the exceptional dialogue needs to make an impact on the audience. When the backstories of the main characters were developed, and the main plot of the film finally began to take it's course, Watchmen had already succeeded in having the depth and resonance of a dozen other films. While it's not an all-time masterpiece, not a moment of its nearly 3-hour runtime is wasted. Every scene serves a purpose to advance the plot, and nearly every dialogue has substantial meaning. The flashbacks with the Comedian, Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach's backstories, the Mars scenes, and Rorschach's monologues are the most resonating. Even the opening credits are exceptionally crafted, summarizing 50 years of an 'altered' American history. In the end, it's hard to describe how well-made this film is, you can tell that every frame was a labor of love. At some points, however, you could also tell where studio execs tampered with the film to make it more appealing to the masses. Nevertheless, that risky, meaningful big-budget films such as The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and Watchmen exist at all show that mainstream cinema has the ability to be the best of both worlds, pieces of entertainment that also stimulate us to think and question. Those are the real blockbusters."
"brando647","9","1","3","29 July 2009"," Excellent Adaptation of Moore's Novel
","I really don't understand where all the hatred for this movie is originating from. I've read a lot of negativity about Zack Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's amazing graphic novel but I completely disagree. Based on his 12-issue series, the film is set in an alternate 1985 where President Nixon is in his third term in office, America won the Vietnam War in less than a week, and the world hangs on the brink of nuclear war between the US and Russia. In a world where masked vigilantism has been outlawed, a former ""hero"" is murdered and what starts as an investigation into his death leads into a greater world-threatening conspiracy. It's an epic movie rich with interesting characters and a complex story; in other words, not your typical ""superhero"" movie.<br/><br/>I had first read Moore's novel back in 2007 so I was exposed to his work a bit before the movie came out. I absolutely loved the book and I was not disappointed by the movie at all. A lot of the book-fans have claimed the movie isn't a faithful adaptation but I feel Snyder did a fantastic job of capturing Moore's story and characters and Dave Gibbon's visuals. Seeing as how it's only a 3 hour movie, there were some cuts to the story for time constraints but all of the important aspects were left intact.<br/><br/>The cast did a fantastic job of capturing the characters from the novel, especially Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Doctor Manhattan looked amazing with the blend of CGI and motion capture. You could tell Snyder used the novel itself as the storyboards, as some scenes seemed ripped right from the pages. What audiences do need to realize is the movie is rated R for a reason; this isn't the normal superhero movie aimed at families and teens. The film has enough mature content, violence, and sexuality that some people may feel the need to avoid the film; I recommend against it because you really would be missing out on one of the best films of 2009. The runtime is a bit much but the movie is fantastic and it's sure to provoke discussion afterwards."
"grendelkhan","5","1","3","27 July 2009"," Music Video version of the story
","I'll preface this by saying I have an inherent bias; I read the comics when they first came out. No movie can compare to that experience, nor to reading the complete book. It was specifically designed to exploit the unique strengths of comics as a storytelling medium. Trying to leave that out, how is the film as a purely cinematic experience? Enh.<br/><br/>The film is nicely shot and staged, but the performances vary from great(Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan), very good (Billy Cruddup), uneven (Patrick Wilson, Malin Akerman) to lifeless (Matthew Goode). The film is more of a string of music videos, with dialogue in between, than a single narrative. Many of the line readings are flat, which detracts from otherwise fine scenes. The Nixon make-up is laughably bad and distracting. Those scenes come across like a bad SNL skit. The historical montages are very good and the most effective pieces.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan really bring their characters to life, which is good, as they are central to the narrative. Billy Cruddup manages a fine performance, even while dealing with effects rigging for the CGI visuals.<br/><br/>I have only viewed the director's cut on DVD, so can't really comment about the theatrical cut. Suffice to say, it's a long 3 hours. It is engaging at times, but it's like riding in a car with a manual transmission and a brand new driver; there are a lot of fits and stops, with occasional smooth moments.<br/><br/>Ultimately the film is disappointing. It does attempt to bring the source material to life, but it gets bogged down by the weight of the material, and is unable to capture most of the subtext. At the risk of fan heresy, I would say the film would have been better served to depart more from the source material to make a tighter story. For a full on adaptation, a mini-series would have been a better vehicle, as the time to properly translate each chapter would be better used. As a theatrical experience, it doesn't flow well.<br/><br/>Anyone looking for a pure action movie would be disappointed by the source material, as well as the film. Watchmen is about the concept of the hero versus the reality of the world's problems. It does have action scenes, but they are not at the center. The film does convey the jist of those ideas, without really exploring their depths. Really, you could have gone two ways with this film and been more successful. You could go the Kubrick route, ala 2001, and explore the ideas presented; or, the pure action route and just focused on the murder mystery/conspiracy. This film tries both, but succeeds at neither. It's a worthy attempt, but, ultimately, a failed one."
"cheekiegrapes","6","1","3","25 July 2009"," Entertaining enough, but a little disappointing.
","I was very excited for this movie, as I had read the graphic novel it was based on, and loved it. I went in realizing that it would be different from the book of course, but this movie made some serious mistakes in casting that really took away from how great the story was.<br/><br/>They paid a lot of attention to the camera-work and effects, which were excellent, and kind of reminiscent of Sin City. They also followed the storyline really well for the most part, and did a great job portraying the journal entries and flashbacks featured in the book to explain more about the story and the background behind the characters and the setting. The worst part about this movie was the casting. Decent enough actors, but a lot of them, especially Night Owl and the Silk Spectre just didn't connect very well to their characters, which really took away from the whole movie and made it hard to enjoy. Some of them just seemed like they were reading lines, without any real emotion or understanding of what they were about. The book is a very complex, emotional tale, that really intertwines with the development of the different characters' lives, backgrounds, and psychology, which just wasn't captured the way it should have been by these actors. I've seen some of them in other films which were really good, so I don't necessarily think it was a lack of talent... just a major disconnect with the meaning and feeling of the storyline.<br/><br/>It's still an entertaining movie, and I'd probably watch it again, but overall, I was pretty disappointed that it wasn't as good as it really should have been."
"flingebunt","6","1","3","13 July 2009"," What have they done?
","It is the 1980s, but in an alternative reality with 2 major differences, one masked heros (not super heros exist) and one god like super hero does exist (Dr Manhattan).<br/><br/>It is the 1980s, the doomsday clock is moving closer and closer to midnight, nuclear destruction is close.<br/><br/>It is hard to review this movie. On one hand it is a literary master piece. The comic book (I won't use graphic novel, because while it is one of the first graphic novels, it wasn't published that way) is visually boring but tells the story in a multilayered manner.<br/><br/>Transitioning to a movie the layers are gone, but in a masterful way which suits the movie medium.<br/><br/>Unfotunately made today it is a period piece, and not enough has been done to remake the movie as a period piece.<br/><br/>The visual style is up-to-date not part of the 1980s, the action scenes which involved ordinary people seem more like the over the top kungfu or super hero pieces. There is no colour or lighting styles from the 80s. The clothes chosen are timeless. Younger viewers might get confused by the alternative time line, not really being able to fit things together as not enough back story is included.<br/><br/>In addition the comic book's original visual style doesn't stand up against modern comic books and graphic novels and provides no visual inspiration for the movie.<br/><br/>Story wise, it is still up there. It is hard to really say, because I found I was filling in untold pieces from the comic book, rather than them being retold to me.<br/><br/>In addition many elements are only really understood by children of the 70s and 80s. In the 70s the caped hero become an icon (Elvis wore a cape on stage). In the 80s these heros were not so popular and the events in the alternative time reflect this.<br/><br/>In addition, only those who grew up in the 1980s, where we would often have serious conversations about surving nuclear holocaust, can really get the core of the story. This is something that was not fleshed out in the movie version.<br/><br/>But then maybe audiences are smart enough not to spoon fed every part of a story (unlike modern movies).<br/><br/>In the end the positives out weigh the negatives.<br/><br/>Something, different, post modern, interesting. I suspect it may become a cult classic as viewers return to the original comics, or review and find the layers inside the story."
"dennis-77","7","1","3","20 April 2009"," Could Have Been So Much Better
","I liked this film, despite the negative tone that this review will take, but it could have been so much better. I put most of the blame on the director, who seems to be passionately in love with the slow-motion button on his camera. The film could have been at least half an hour shorter with the pointless slow-motion scenes taken out. The pacing was one of the problems, the other is that the opening 15 minutes or so (basically 'The Times They Are A Changing and the first fight) are so very good that the rest of the film has to live up to them, which it sadly only does sporadically.<br/><br/>The acting was uniformly good, and on several peoples's parts, excellent, as was the set design. My problems with the stunt choreography would probably have been solved if they hadn't had to fit to the director's whims.<br/><br/>The make-up was variable, with the make up on the original Silk Spectre being distractingly bad, which was a shame as Carla Gugino was brilliant as Sally Jupiter.<br/><br/>As an adaptation it had its bonuses and its flaws, but I think that the change made to the ending was definitely a good idea. There was however something lacking, but I have no idea what the something was, hence the possibly mildly unreasonably low rating. A re-watch may move this up to 4 stars but there were too many flaws for it to be anything better than okay."
"demonchessmaster","7","1","3","3 April 2009"," A nearly flawless rendition--but not for everyone
","When I first heard that Zack Synder was on board to direct this film, I thought to myself 'hey, this couldn't be too bad'. After all, the 300 film was faithful to the comic, so I was interested to see how this would turn out. When I did see the film, I was completely blown away by how amazing close to the graphic novel it was! So, it's safe to assume this is a good film, right? Well... yes and no. Baring in mind, I'm coming from the point of view of someone who has read the comic Watchmen (one of the greatest stories of all time), so naturally I'm being a little biased to the film. As a comic fan myself, it really winds me up when film companies get comic book adaptations wrong. Most of the time, they just take the basic plots of the book and then end up doing their own thing, ruining the story and character. But in Watchmen, it's practically like the book--albeit a heavily edited version of it. While I'm sure fans of the comic will really enjoy this film, those who haven't read the comic may struggle with it. The long running time, slightly complicated story lines, graphic violence and some rather unpleasant central characters will probably put off a few film goers who aren't that big on epic comic book films. Though the film has a running theme of nuclear war, it's more a character driven film--and every character seems to have a story to tell, so this film may feel a little drawn out to some people. My advice is that if you want to see this film, I'd suggest reading the comic first--that will make the film a little easier to follow as it has some character development and back story left out in the film. But if you are a fan of the comic, you will most likely think this film does the story justice. Overall, it's one of the better comic book adaptations in recent years. Not quite as groundbreaking as The Dark Knight, but nearly as dark and with an ending that is both bleak, but hopeful at the same time."
"wackyjacky54","7","1","3","27 March 2009"," Too much story too little time
","If you think about it, most great novels never make good movies, in fact I can't think of a single one. Maybe the writers and directors feel too much pressure to include everything or maybe it's just too hard to beat the original. I mean, it wasn't intended for the screen, so what do you expect right? Well, anyways...I think this film had a lot of good elements in it, but it just didn't come together perfectly like an original screenplay would have. Don't get me wrong, I actually liked the film...It was only towards the end I began to enjoy it, I felt the first hour was pretty hard to watch. I think the Snyder had a lot on his hands, and maybe if he spent a little more time with the script, and a little more time editing it, the film would have come out much better. I thought that the star of the film was Rorschach, with his Clint Eastwood style presence, he was interestingly played out. The action was good, story was good, visuals were good, everything was good. But nothing was excellent. Maybe my expectations were just too high. The novel and trailer nearly blew me away.<br/><br/>But, I've gotta admit, Snyder has got some balls trying to make a film like this. I was surprised he got away with the violence and the studios were OK with it. I respect him for pushing the edges of what can or cant be done in this type of genre. Snyder is one of the few directors out there right now that have potential to be great, but I'm afraid it's probably not going to happen anytime soon. A lot of lessons to be learned from this one. Either way, good luck with the next film."
"boe_dye","10","1","3","21 March 2009"," boe_dye sez: It wasn't until someone explained it to me that I understood why so many fanboys were jacked about this movie...
","I will be honest. This movie was a great film. Visually stunning, gripping, story and flow. This movie was a great film.<br/><br/>So much in fact that, and I will be honest, I like many posers out there went and read the original comic.<br/><br/>And in many cases this is scene for scene the comic. Dialogue almost identical. But where it fails with the fanboys is that it lacks the spirit that was Alan Moores ""Watchmen"".<br/><br/>Mostly subtle character traits were flawed. The subtle nuances that this film could have easily captured were completely abandoned.<br/><br/>The book was not an action packed adventure story. It was a philosophical character study. A dark look into the behind the scenes workings of heroes, or more appropriately an answer to a question of what is the extreme a person with unlimited means can go to achieve world wide peace.<br/><br/>Now of course, most American audiences would rather see something go ""boom"" as opposed to something that makes them go ""huh..."". A movie like ""2001 a space odyssey"" or more recently ""The Fountain"" is usually met with scorn and dismay simply because the audience did not understand it.<br/><br/>This movie upset just about everyone to some level. Parents who were stupid enough not to notice the ""R"" rating, and think that this movie was some kind of cute super hero movie like Spider-Man or Fantastic Four were met with a very unpleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Fanboys were upset because it missed the Spirit of Watchmen.<br/><br/>Then you have the childlike whimperings from the simpletons concerning Dr. Manhattans genitalia. Of course Silk Specters tits are perfectly fine to oogle, but a large blue penis attached to the perfected enlightened man is not.<br/><br/>I have come to learn that with movies based on comics, you have to be able to separate the two. Like an alternate reality, or marvel's ""What If?"" series. This isn't cannon. This isn't the comic. It is a movie based on the comic. It is a re-telling.<br/><br/>Is it a good retelling? I believe so. But this story wasn't close to my heart like it was with so many people. I did not read comics when this originally came out.<br/><br/>As a movie it was superb, and in the end, that is what I spent my money on.<br/><br/>***Edit*** Second Viewing on DVD The Directors Cut<br/><br/>After watching it again, and only after having read the TPB, I can now say that I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It really does the comic justice, and does in fact capture the spirit of the original Alan Moore tale.<br/><br/>Admittedly there is much for graphic action then in the comic, however if the movie lacked the slightly exaggerated action then it wouldn't have done well in the end.<br/><br/>One of the biggest gripes that I have argued against is that in fact the ending was changed. Of course when it was written we lived prior to 9/11. Today we live in a post 9/11 world. My contention is that the comic book ending simply isn't big enough for the story to be effective in today's day and age. Never the less, this film is superb and the directors cut is even closer to the TPB then the theatrical version. Ultimately though, I do believe that have the conversation with Jon and Adrian at the end would have been more prolific then having Lara utter the lines ""nothing ends, nothing ever ends"", however with all of Alan Moores works his endings are a bit on the meledratic side and tend to be difficult no matter how you portray them.<br/><br/>Otherwise this is a fantastic film and even more so after having read the original comic that it was based upon."

","I wouldn't consider myself a Comic Book Geek, nor would I consider myself one of those Graphic Novel Fanboy Types. What i would consider myself is a Moviegoer! simple as that! I am a fan of all genres and know what to expect from them. I first heard of Watchmen about three years ago when it was originally being helmed by Paul Greengrass, the Idea of a Superhero movie about Non-Powered SuperHeros sounded interesting. I then got hold of the Grahic Novel and read it within two days, wetting my appetite for the Movie, and also sharing the same views as other Fans ""How the hell will they film this?"". Now when this question was asked, it wasn't because the visuals were complicated or even the characters impossible to adapt, it was sheerly the detail and depth the story arc had, that was going to prove a problem. But I am happy to report, Zack Synder (300), the Director has just about pulled it off.....Just!<br/><br/>The Theatrical Version stands at a mega 163 minutes, but bear in mind this is roughly the same running time as The Dark Knight and a few Harry Potter Movies, and to be honest it does feel it, but thats not to say thats a bad thing. With so much information to cram into 163 minutes it does take things slow and attempts to ease you in slowly. This does allow your Brain to take everything in and keep you up to date with what is going on. Watchmen is the Thinking Mans Superhero movie, a film layered with Mystery, Depth and all set in a world that is both Unrealistic and Realistic in equal measure.<br/><br/>The Characters vary from Spot On ( Rorshach, Night Owl and The Comedian ) to Under-developed and Clichéd ( Silk Spectre ) to Incredibly Subtle ( Dr Manhatten - Which special praise goes out to Billy Crudrup ). You can't help that the Characters are let down by the simple medium of movement. On page their characters emotions and feelings are shown through subtle expression, but on screen it's hard to concentrate on them purely when the background is beautifully shot. This is not to say any bad acting has occurred, actually far from it, but this was a battle that was never going to be won, and I think the Makers knew that<br/><br/>The Movie is Brutal, holds no punches and Dark, but gets away with it due to it's Comic Book Stylisation. Its like Magnolia written for the screen by Stan lee!<br/><br/>Stand Out Scenes almost all involve Rorchach. whereas the less exciting scenes involve Silk Spectre. Now lets not begin to think The Silk Spectre ruins this films, because she doesn't ( She is very sexy! ) its just that, with all thats happening, she kind of gets sucked up and almost blends in with the scenery<br/><br/>The ending will split Fans! Whether its down the fact you miss the Squid? Don't understand it? or simply think it's pretentious and Over-thought is your Opinion. My Opinion is that The changes from the Novel, benefit better on screen than they would have on paper<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A Movie for Fans of the Novel. Non- Novel readers,will struggle to take it all in, first time round. A film that will make more sense long after you've left the cinema.<br/><br/>9/10"

I didn't mind sitting through the 3 hours even into the opening credits I knew I was going to like it. The way they took famous photos and altered them to include the Minutemen was great. I liked watching the movie simply to see the twists they put on American history. As i expected, the special effects were amazing i look forward to watching it on Blu-ray.

"PeterRoeder","8","1","3","17 March 2009"," Fairly good adaptation
","It was an impossible job to adapt the graphic novel to a movie. However, this film does a fairly good job. ""300"" was also a very powerful movie, and ""Watchmen"" seems to be loyal and fair to the novel. ""Watchmen"" as a comic-book made a great impression on me when I was a teenager, so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It didn't disappoint me, and I am probably going to watch it again. Especially Rorschach was quite impressive. I, perhaps, had a problem with some of the music, putting in Leonard Cohen and Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"" doesn't necessarily capture the essence of the Watchmen comic book. Why not put in the quotes by Nietzsche and Jung then? And there's a quote from the ""book of Job"" as well. These were left out in the movie. Also I thought it was a bit funny that all the heroes fight in the martial arts style taken to the big screen originally by Bruce Lee. Very nice - sort of reminded about the science-fiction movie ""Equlibirium"". Some things were changed in the movie. Sometimes for obscure reasons. But anyway it would have been impossible to get it all in a 2-hour movie. Unlike other Alan Moore adaptations such as ""V for Vendetta"" the changes in this movie still keeps, I think, the essence of the graphic novel intact. Others might disagree about this. I don't know what Alan Moore thinks about this movie. Apparently he doesn't want to see it and I don't think his name was mentioned at all in the credits. However, it was very interesting to see this movie and I cried several times because of the intensity of the drama. I've heard that there is a Watchmen computer game out also. I don't know if it is any good though. Anyway, I am probably going to watch this movie again."
"supramaxx","9","1","3","17 March 2009"," Watchmen Movie Review
","Watchmen Movie Review<br/><br/>Watchmen was yet another film I came into the theater knowing nothing about, except that all my friends had seen it and told me it was excellent. I was expecting something like a mix of Sin City and V for Vendetta. While it did borrow certain elements from both movies, it was something totally unique in its entirety. The accurate 1985 setting and the masterful depiction of this alternate world and its history throughout the 20th century and the story of the heroes that are center to the movie and the undergoing nuclear detente that was the definition of the cold war between the Soviet Union and the United States was done well. In going with the backdrop of the threat of Nuclear Holocaust, we also see the conflicts and character studies of the Watchmen who are several heroes with their own deep history. As well as the internal conflict the intriguing God-like hero Dr. Manhattan undergoes in which he struggles to understand human nature and if humanity is actually worth saving.<br/><br/>Genre: Action/Sci-Fii<br/><br/>The Good: The first thing that struck me with this movie is the excellent cinematography and the excellent musical score used throughout the movie. The history of this Alternate United States is told exceptionally, with numerous scenes striking the heart, such as JFK's assassination. There are also many images that will stay burned in your head throughout the movie, from the scenes in Mars, to the rape scenes, to all the bloody and gory scenes. The setting of the movie was perfect depicting a gritty 1985 New York where even though the United States is a police state with Richard Nixon as president, still greed, corruption, and crime still run rampant. Dr. Manhattan is a wonder to watch, he has so many amazing powers that truly make him like God, yet has a calm detached demeanor as he struggles to understand humanity. All the other characters are well done, esp. Rorschach a conflicted hero that may be insane who has a mask that has Rorschach ink blots that are constantly shifting, to the all American do-gooder Nite Owl, to the ""villain"" of the movie, golden boy Ozymandias (Veight). The story itself while very long and complex could have been a bit better, but is satisfactory to me. The constant news of the world being at the brink of nuclear holocaust really captures the sentiment of the Cold War. Overall a great movie with many positives.<br/><br/>The Bad: The weakest link might have been the story, the main gripe was that it was way too long and complex with many heroes to follow. But I liked it. The conclusion to me was sort of weak, but I guess it was a nice surprising twist but I think it was unnecessary.<br/><br/>The Ugly: There are so many bloody, violent, and gory scenes in the movie that it may turn off some. But I enjoyed it, it showed humans at its worst. Also Dr.Manhattan is naked most of the movie, but I don't think it was ugly, it was amazing!<br/><br/>Overall, one of the better hero films I have seen in recent memory. I loved the history of this alternate United States and the depiction of the Cold War. Dr. Manhattans powers were mind-blowing, there were also plenty of philosophical points as Dr.Manhattan struggles to understand humans and their natures. The Cinematography, Setting, and Musical Score are worth the price of admission alone. There are also many scenes which depict the ugly side of humanity all in making the movie more real. The story could have been a bit better, but it was satisfactory to me.<br/><br/>Supra Score - 8.5/10"
"Monotreme02","4","1","3","16 March 2009"," Entertaining and well-made, but some major issues with the plot
","It's impossible to write a review about a movie like this without mentioning its visual aspect, so we'll get to that now. Like his films or not, it's hard to deny that Zack Snyder knows how to direct a movie and especially make it visually appealing; there's no doubt that he's a rising star in contemporary cinema. If there's one thing that even detractors of Watchmen have to admit, it's that this film looks GOOD! And by good I mean absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. The production/set and costume design both exquisitely capture the comic book feel of the movie, but keep it dark and gritty, like it's supposed to be. It's highly stylized, but this is more like the evil twin brother version of Dick Tracy rather than like Dick Tracy itself. The special effects are, for the most part, top-notch, and Dr. Manhattan in particular serves as yet another example in the ever-improving motion capture technology, used so well in The Lord of the Rings but with mixed results since. With an exquisitely expert ability to know exactly where to place the camera and how to move it, light the scene and utilize special effects, Snyder is definitely turning out to be one of the most visually talented directors of his generation. Although his work so far has been as glossy and commercial as it gets, it's impossible to say that the man isn't creative, or that his films aren't works of art.<br/><br/>While I immensely enjoyed and appreciated the film's thoroughly in-depth development and portrayal of its fascinating characters, rich back story and the whole Watchmen mythology in general, I still had some fundamental aspects with the actual plot, specifically with the third act. Without giving too much away, I will humbly ask how many times have we seen the ""twist""/character revelation that initiates the finale/confrontation at the end of the film? It's an old, tired plot technique that we've seen countless times before, and almost takes away from the wonderfully high quality of the first two thirds of the film. Speaking of the ending, I think it would be appropriate to address the major issue amongst fans of the graphic novel regarding the finale. Again, without giving too much away, I have been informed about the nature of the finale as it appears in the original comic by friends of mine who HAVE read it, and although there seemed to be a pretty big controversy amongst die-hard fans irrationally demanding precise and total accuracy and adherence to the source material, in my opinion, Zack Snyder made a very wise decision in changing the ending. In essence It's the same and serves the same purpose, but although the film had its fair share of supernatural and fantastical elements, mainly in the Dr. Manhattan character, all of them worked and made sense in the context of the film, and I feel that had Snyder gone with the original ending, it would have thrown the film into an entirely different direction in terms of its supernatural elements and would have been totally out of place. In general, there were a few aspects of the film that really polarized me. I thought that the best scene was actually the opening credits sequence, featuring an incredibly well-made and gorgeous looking collage of still and moving images depicting the historical setting and history of the Watchmen/Minutemen and of some of the characters, all combined in different layers with the camera sweeping through them, while Bob Dylan croons ""Oh the times they are a-changin'"" on the soundtrack. On the other hand, I absolutely hated the scenes with Richard Nixon, and felt that his make-up was ridiculously over-the-top and completely out of place. I know that Snyder was just trying to capture the essence of the exaggerated, caricature-version of Nixon as he appears in the comic book, but it was just so preposterous that it completely took me out of the film.<br/><br/>Big, event, blockbuster movies have never been the same since we entered the internet age. Unlike the blockbusters of the past  Star Wars, E.T., Batman, Jurassic Park  which we knew nothing about prior to their release except what the posters and trailers showed us, now audiences seem to know every little detail about a movie's content and production months before it is even released. The internet is not only an incredible advertising tool, what with hype and anticipation for movies increased tenfold with the help of internet message board chatter and word-of-mouth, but is also an unlimitedly powerful source of pressure, pressure on filmmakers, directors, producers and everyone involved in these projects to meet fan expectations and stick to the beloved source material, whatever it may be. Many projects recently seem to attempt to stay closer and closer to the source material, usually comic books in this case, with mixed results. Watchmen seems to fit somewhere in between the two camps of The Incredible Hulk and The Dark Knight. On the one hand, it benefits from sticking to its source material, Snyder having chosen not to skim over any of the details and aspects of the incredibly rich mythology present in the graphic novel. On the other hand, by sticking so closely to the original comic, Watchmen suffers slightly because a graphic novel, or a novel in general, will always be far richer and contain far more details, sub-plots, and in-depth character development than a movie would ever be able to fully encompass, and so I feel that Snyder may have slightly overreached in order to be faithful to the comic keep the fans of the graphic novel, which include himself, happy. Still, it's an immensely entertaining movie, incredibly well-made, fascinating and in-depth, and although I had some major issues with the plot, I still quite enjoyed it."

","Watchmen, one of the best graphic novels finally came to the movies pleasing all its fans around the globe. It is a frenetic, mind blowing film full of action, adventure, suspense and some nice black humor. Directed by Zack Snyder, the also director of 300 made a very good job with the adaptation along with writers David Hayter and Alex Tse. The movie is long, maybe I would cut some unnecessary parts and at the beginning it has a slow rhythm but the second part runs a little more fluid. The soundtrack is excellent, each song selected to in every scene fits to the perfection. Another thing that was quite good and interesting was the references made of people or some event of each decade shown in the movie for example Ozymandias outside the Studio 54 with a person supposed to be David Bowie. The special effects are so stunning you'll get with you mouth wide open. The cast is very good, each actor delivers and outstanding performance specially Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. In conclusion, Watchmen is so astonishing that it can be consider one of the best movie of the year."

","If I wanted to see a porno I would have rented one. I was disillusioned by all the hype and expected more. When the fight scenes occurred I felt every emotion that I believed the creator wanted to be shown. The digital graphics were outstanding and the audio selections were spot on. The details of each character seemed to just miss. I don't feel that I had enough character background since I was not one to read the comic books in this era. I don't feel the rating for this film was high enough since there was two 18-19 year old boys sitting in front on me giggling thru the whole movie about a blue male organ. I would not recommend this movie for any one under the age of 25. Nor would I recommend it to members of my family or friends."
"TheDarkKnight12","9","1","3","15 March 2009"," Watching the Watchmen
","First things first; I read the graphic novel prior to seeing this movie. I, personally, think this is a necessary step. Obviously, I cannot comment on the experience from the perspective of somebody previously ignorant of the source material, but due to the depth and detail of the graphic novel which incorporates several mediums of communication such as excerpts from biographies, other comic books (comic within a comic) and journal articles. That being said, this is a movie review.<br/><br/>The movie is very similar to the graphic novel, a lot of the script retains dialogue taken directly from the novel; several of the shots are literal translations from paper to screen in a very impressive manner. This movie is a very faithful adaptation of the novel. Some elements are changed, and it is common knowledge that the end is changed fundamentally, which I will not discuss here in my hopefully spoiler-free analysis. Any changes have been made out of necessity, to reduce the still-long length of the movie, and in some cases, made out of convenience, not detracting any meaning from the story itself; essentially, de-bulking the story to fit a movie.<br/><br/>I thought the casting was brilliant, Rorschach is very similar to Christian Bale's Batman at points, such as his husky voice, and unquestionable resolve. That being said, Rorschach still holds his own, and some, making him a modern legend. The cinematography was breath-taking, the drama fast-moving, which, with such a large amount of dialogue to go through, never seems slow or stuck.<br/><br/>One thing which did surprise me was the amount of violence in the film and the graphic nature of these scenes - admittedly, all present in the graphic novel, albeit, some changes have been made.<br/><br/>This is not your average superhero movie - it's grimy, it's real, it's dirty, it's violent, it's pain-stakingly psychoanalytical explaining several means, not necessarily converging on similar ends. This is a movie of morality, war, conflicting attitudes and resolve where the audience truly empathises with some characters and finds others utterly repulsive.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this movie was excellent. I am glad I read the graphic novel before it, but even so I believe the movie could stand on its own; however, I recommend reading before seeing to get the most out of it."

"wittzi","9","1","3","15 March 2009"," Epic film, epic cast ... VERY adult
","First off, I never read comic books as a kid and had no idea who The Watchmen were. I just knew that there were major issues in releasing this film and that a friend of mine saw it and all he would say was that ""it was worth seeing"".<br/><br/>I was completely blown away, although you don't leave the cinema on a high, but rather reflect on all sorts of issues that the film addresses. It's amusing to see the number of people that have given this film a bad rating saying that the acting was poor or the story didn't make sense. I do entirely sympathise with these people, because they obviously weren't born with enough furniture in their brain to understand the multitude of complexities that this film contained. I don't think that a film should get 1 star because ""you don't get it""!?<br/><br/>The acting was first class for most of the cast; noticeably Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Billy Crudup as Dr Manhatten. I'm sure that the majority of people that have watched this film were hanging off their every word (or punch / kick) and I loved Rorschach's mask! The noticeable exception here was Matthew Goode who I thought was extremely weak as Ozymanias, actually making any section of the film that he was involved with much more mundane than the rest. I also thought that Malin Akerman was a little out of her league compared to the other cast members (and I didn't think she was a fit as everyone made out)!<br/><br/>However, the story was interesting, involved and the flashbacks really kept me excited about who these watchmen were and what they were about. Additionally, I thought that the extreme violence was a significant part of this film. It was clearly adult in nature from the beginning, but some of the character's gruesome endings and the bone-crunching fight scenes kept the film firmly in the fantasy realm, even though much of it was about the gritty, uphill struggles of human life and human nature (albeit with a glowing blue, quantum physics superhero)!<br/><br/>In all, I walked out of the film a little bewildered about what I had just seen in regard to every aspect; the story, the acting, the effects (which were all amazing apart from the Mars scene which was unusually very poor) and the overall theme of the film. However, this was a good thing. I had an hour's drive to get home as I was visiting friends that evening and after that time I concluded that this was an absolutely epic film that was interesting, bold and very adult. However, this was in a mature way (unusual for a superhero film) and not purely through extreme violence or sex (of which there was plenty also)!<br/><br/>This will definitely be one to buy on blu-ray when it's released to take another look!"
"TheGautamMathur","9","1","3","14 March 2009"," Snyder gets it right!
","Whenever I read a book, in my mind, I try to picture it as a screenplay and how it would translate on screen. It was an exercise I had tried with Watchmen as well, but couldn't see it through... there is so much going on in the novel, that it always seemed an impossible task to get it done. On the other hand, if there was one piece of literature begging for a movie adaptation, it was this. Its good news then that the team did that so wonderfully! <br/><br/>The movie was as layered as a movie can be without it getting too boring. It gave us an insight into every major character by exploring their back-stories/motivations/arcs enough to give it enough substance, so that it all makes sense, even to the uninitiated, without getting too slow or boring. <br/><br/>Even though I see the book more as a philosophical treatise more than an action piece, Snyder does enough to raise the bar on the action front to make it enjoyable in that sense as well, by inserting engaging action sequences where there is scope.<br/><br/>Also the camera work is absolutely stunning, and for the most part hits it spot on. There has been some criticism of the music though, but I think the soundtrack sums up the movie very very well. <br/><br/>Of the performances, Patrick Wilson is the pick of the litter with a nuanced and sensitive portrayal of the character and his emotional depth. Jackie Earle Hailey as the super-cool Rorschach is awesome as well... I found Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan and Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian extremely engaging. I don't think Matthew Goode can act as well as he thinks he can, and Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre is absolutely horrible, Its like she's in a school play! <br/><br/>Overall, I was very happy, right from the phenomenal opening title sequence, right down to the ending, with a few hiccoughs and gripes in between, they're too insignificant to complain about... <br/><br/>Watch it, its for anyone who likes their movies deep, layered, and more than just about men in masks running about, trying to make the world a better place."
"sonick_yooth","6","1","3","14 March 2009"," Trailer for novel
","Watchmen the film is a gorgeous 3 hour long trailer for Watchmen the novel. Yes, it is a faithful adaptation of the plot of the novel. All the ""important"" characters are there, moving from one memorable scene from the novel to another. They are speaking in paroles, one memorable sentence following another, replicated from the script of distilled ""plot-related"" word bubbles of the book. In theory, this should work just fine, serving multiple purposes of broad appeal and money that comes with it, that are expected from modern mainstream blockbuster. In all honesty, I wish it does well on the box office, just so long it doesn't tarnish it's future evaluation. But, for now, film is just not adequate. <br/><br/>Watchmen the novel is a work of art, transcending not only it's medium, but even reader's comprehension of it. It is a massive achievement of words and images, crafted with a watchmakers precision. Multiple story lines mix together from one panel to another, words dance and intertwine, one word bubble commenting on actions of different characters chapters back. It is an experience like no other and achievable only in it's own medium. <br/><br/>When it comes to the film, that experience is non existed. Narrative technique, the most important part of the novel, is reduced to simple, straight forward plot development. There is no meat on the bone, no lushness of the novel, the way every frame was crammed with details and information. For example, Rorschach's prison experience is a story within a story of a man becoming ""strange"". His mother, the boys in the street, Kitty Genovese, dogs..., are all little pieces inside of him, memories, imprinted in the very fiber of his being, into his very face. In the film, dr. Malcolm, his interrogator, is a mere ""easter egg"", the ruination of his life at the realizations Rorschach brings ""is not important enough"", obviously. And that is the problem with everything in the movie! Almost every character is an easter egg, a nudge towards the fans. Dan and Lauires path of emotions just some regular Joe comedy and awkward slow motion sex. It is inexcusable that slow and sexy moments of the novel (like the whole ""I think I caught the title"" part) are transformed into an ironic parody, a self aware likable awkwardness. <br/><br/>Novel loses it's meaning the moment you think it's plot is relevant. Watchmen's plot is one of the least important aspects of the book. The whole plot of dr. Manhattans chapter is that he is sitting on Mars. And yet, it is long, deep, sad and powerful meditation on life. All the movie offers is a translation of some scenes to the screen, with the best lines as narration. And that in itself is absurd. There is no substance, especially not ""Watchmen-experience"" substance. <br/><br/>There are parts that are terrible, meaningless and pointless. The narrators of the whole story, news papers vendor and the kid with the comic are non existent, their death at the end present (it is a MEMORABLE scene, after all) and lacking any sense or any kind of emotion. And that should have been at least a part of the f*ing point.<br/><br/>There are numerous gorgeous parts, even some fine alterations to some elements (docs studio confrontation), but they only serve the plot. Something that should have been just a part of the experience. <br/><br/>All in all, Watchmen is an OK film. They had the makings of Godfather greatness in the material, they chose to make a film with pointless plot out of it. They stripped everything, they sterilized every scene, they reduced the intricacies of the narrative to string of scenes that don't amount to much. It's mediocrity is it's biggest fault."

","When I first saw the trailer of watchmen I thought what the hell is this; a blue guy, couple of superheros. Then I read about the what the movie is about and it wasn t bad. I decided to see it.<br/><br/>The movie is action but beneath it there is political things, that makes the movie more realistic. The opening scene of the movie was probably the best one I ve seen so far. The action is slow motion that makes the scene ten times better. Throughout the movie has an idea of how people are violent and even the superhero ""the comedian"" (the most violent superhero out of the others feel really bad about what he has been doin and about the things he has done in the Vietnam war. In the movie it always talks about the cold war, how American s want to make renewable energy and the idea of that there always can be a miracle. The visionaries throughout was great and i really liked how the movie tells about each characters past.<br/><br/>The movie goes on like that but the ending is too long there is too much talking. Even though we get the point story goes on with more and more talking. The ending is great but too long.

"webhead54","9","1","3","14 March 2009"," Now this is how you do fight scenes!
","I've never collected comics or graphic novels, and never spent much time reading them. But I like a lot of the movies that are based on them. Batman, Spider-man, X-men, The Fantastic Four--the list seems endless. Movie adaptations of comics is a genre that seems to pretty closely adhere to the plot/action/special effects basics. Where Watchmen sets itself apart from the pack is first with the uniqueness of the original comic. I had never heard of Watchmen until the media started reporting about the studio legal issues. Reading about the Watchmen story--superheroes who have been cast out from a delusional, pre-apocalyptic world--got me interested.<br/><br/>Beyond the unusual background/setting of the Watchmen world, you have a movie that breaks away somewhat from the strict formula that has been established. You get a lot of character development as the movie spends large chunks of time on dialog and background story for the individual characters. Having not experience the original comic, I liked the added information, but at times it caused the movie to drag, particularly in the middle, and I would say this is largely responsible for the 2.5+ hour runtime.<br/><br/>Despite the unusual amount of time spent on character development for an action/adventure movie, and the slow story development particularly toward the middle, the exceptional cinematography and action sequences more than makes up for it. This movie is simply visually stunning. And, on top of it, it's believable. I get so exasperated with the close-in, shake the camera around, action filming that directors in recent years have resorted to when filming fight scenes, car chases, etc. Look to Bourne Supremacy (2004) for a perfect example of this--it gives me a headache. Kudos to Zack Snyder for taking the time to film fight scenes that look like real fight scenes. In fact, Watchmen has the best action fighting I've seen in a big budget film in years.<br/><br/>Along these lines, one of the things I like best about Watchmen is that in an unreal science fiction world of superheroes, Watchmen keeps the filming real. What do I mean by this? I like movies like Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and Transformers (2007), but they are classic examples of overdoing it. Must the action build up to impossible feats that defy not only the laws of physics, but also the boundaries of willing suspension of disbelief? I think the biggest plus for Watchmen is that it doesn't fall victim to the age of computer generated graphics. Everything looks real and plausible. It does not go over the top into the realm of the fabulously ridiculous. Unlike Wanted (2008), another graphic novel to movie rendition, when miraculous feats occur, Watchmen provides a believable context for how the miraculous is accomplished.<br/><br/>The same media which piled up the unrealistic expectations for Watchmen is already kicking dirt on this film because of the modest box office showing. The critics are blathering about the convoluted plot and plodding pace. I don't get it. Yes, maybe too much time was spent on character development, but the plot is as straightforward and simplistic as it gets--the superpowers are about to ignite a cataclysmic nuclear war, and a rouge band of forgotten superheroes have to prevent it. That's it. Don't get distracted by all the hype, side bars, snide comments, and whatever other garbage the media generates.<br/><br/>The bottom line: If you enjoy movies like The Dark Knight or even Hancock, there's absolutely no reason you won't like this film."
"poikkeus","4","1","3","14 March 2009"," Asleep on the Watch
","WATCHMEN may be the most ambitious, sweeping superhero movie yet produced. It combines an almost painfully realistic social viewpoint, clearly drawn characters, and more than enough sound and visual effects to fill in the cracks. But at 163 minutes, the plot is often bogged down in flashbacks, and the plot itself can be flabby, at times. As for the action...I can't recall the kind of bristling excitement as for BATMAN RETURNS or IRON MAN; there are several strong sequences, but they lack a dimension of detail.<br/><br/>The action occurs in an '80s alternative historical context when Richard Nixon is going through his fourth term - a terrifying idea for any movie - but the make-up for nearly all the characters, including the commentators from Washington Week in Review, seem doughy and unreal. Only Henry Kissinger seems comes off as relatively realistic.<br/><br/>This was maybe the first time when I've been underwhelmed by an IMAX adaptation. In fact, both sound and visuals seem identical to what one would expect from a standard digital screening, with a dimension that at times seems almost analog."
"Eumenides_0","5","1","3","14 March 2009"," Fails as an Adapation, Fails as a Movie
","I have some difficulty judging this movie. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' comic book has become one of my favorite books. I've been rereading it for some six years now, always reveling in the new things I find out or just enjoying the dialogue, action and characters. It's a dense, multi-layered, delightful piece of literature.<br/><br/>So I dreaded the adaptation, and yet I couldn't resist watching it. I knew no movie could do justice to a work that was crafted so finely for the comics medium. We live in an age in which so-called writers write garbage that looks like scripts waiting to be shot. Dan Brown's novels come to mind. Watchmen was not that: every page had the language of comics on it.<br/><br/>Mr. Zack Snyder evidently doesn't understand that medium nor the one he has decided to work on, for he confuses both. His confusion begins with treating the panels of Gibbons as storyboards. What works in a static medium doesn't work in another in which movement is the key-word. Obviously the movie sounds flat and lifeless, a bit like Sin City, another movie which just turned comics panels into frames.<br/><br/>Then Snyder, being a mediocre director, can't even use his medium to good use. Someone should tell that man that just because cameras have an option called slow-mo it shouldn't be used. Everything stops in this movie: a guy jumps, there's a stop; a house explodes, a stop; a kick, a stop. I guess that's meant to be dramatic, but it's just silly.<br/><br/>The costumes are mostly appalling. Most seem non-functional, too heavy and hardly suitable for superheroes. And some must have come straight from Batman & Robin's wardrobe; thankfully the nipples are absent. In an age in which superhero movies have come a long way since this awful movie, and has given us great costumes in Spider-Man, Batman Begins, X-Men, Iron Man and Superman, it's sad the costumes of Watchmen look so awful. Exception goes to Rorschach, whose shifting mask is great. Dr. Manhattan is also amazing, but then in this day and age CGI characters are hardly remarkable.<br/><br/>The script is god-awful, and I guess David Hayter takes responsibility for that. The characters are one-dimensional (but then the actors aren't that great either) and the plot runs at a frantic pace. Patrick Wilson did a great job with Nite Owl, and I liked Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian. But most seemed to be spouting their lines just for the paycheck without ever believing their characters.<br/><br/>In the end it's a fun, campy movie that takes itself too seriously without having any artistic substance to do so. A friend told me the fans won't like it, and the average viewers will find it boring. I don't agree: I think it can be enjoyed by either group, but for anyone who's read the comic it disappoints; and for anyone who likes cinema in itself, it disappoints too. But it entertains and I don't regret the 160 minutes I spent watching it."
"debjyoti1981","8","1","3","13 March 2009"," Zack's Dream Project Could Have Been Better.......... Director's Cut is Better than Theatrical Release........
","Because of the publicity put up by the aggressive marketing by its distributors, I had decided to read Alan Moore's Graphic Novel first before watching the movie.<br/><br/>Alan Moore's 'Watchmen' had been one of the unsurpassed graphic novels I have ever read in a long time. Those who have not read the novel, the story of 'Watchmen' exist in an alternate reality where Americans have won the Vietnam War, Nixon had been elected three consecutive times for the successful drive in Vietnam and the Superheroes/Vigilantes are the part of the Society. This story originated at the peak of the Cold War, and what kept the Russians form launching an aggressive campaign against U.S. was due to the presence of Dr. Manhattan (enacted by Billy Crudup). Due to the violent methods of providing justice, the superheroes had become detested among the public, thus leading to pass of Legislation Act which outlawed them. Though most of the heroes accepted forced retirement, two of them had been kept of the book 'Dr. Manhattan' & 'The Comedian' as they were working on Government's surveillance. Only 'Rorschach' was one of the vigilantes who had not accepted the act and continued his work undercover.<br/><br/>The story starts with the murder of one of the vigilante 'The Comedian' followed by an independent investigation taken up by Rorschach; likewise we get introduced to all the other Superheroes who were given the name 'Watchmen'. First half is mostly flashback which introduces us to the characters at the same time it slowly carries the story to the core Novel's Climax.<br/><br/>This movie could have been way much better. The entire novel was full of intensity. Some of the characters seemed to be less developed in this adaptation other than Rorschach, which was done marvelously by Jackie Earle Haley. Even Dr. Manhattan's tone didn't seem true. Though most of the content had been taken directly from the novel still some segment looked consciously altered to mesh with the alternate ending. Even 'Tales Of The Black Freighter' was not included within the movie which I think can be justified with the limitation of the time constraint.<br/><br/>Visually this movie is stunning packed with slow paced action which we have already seen in Zack Snyder's 300, with some of the musical tracks of the late 80's. Unlike other Comic based movies, this movie had been too brutal for which it got easily 'R' Rating.<br/><br/>There could have been lot of potential to make this story a magnum opus keeping true to the content of Alan Moore. Anyone who has not read the novel will not be able to realize what have failed actually while recreating this into a big motion picture.<br/><br/>Looking at the efforts undertaken I would prefer to give it a solid 6.5/10.<br/><br/>New Update: Director's Cut<br/><br/>Well on seeing the Director's Cut I felt good, may be this was the better adaptation compared to the Theatrical Release.<br/><br/>It seems that after each viewing this Movie is really turning out to be good. Its strange that on the first screening I had been very skeptical but later on it did click for me. May be I should have given it more chance.<br/><br/>New Rating: 8/10"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","5","1","3","12 March 2009"," Uneven
","I will mainly review Watchmen as an adaptation, and while supporters of the film can make the valid argument that it should not be judged this way, Zach Snyder has taken great pride in its supposed loyalty to the graphic novel, therefore I believe this method is also valid. Watchmen brilliantly recreates scenes from the graphic novel, but these moments are greater than the sum of its parts. Snyder muddled some of the key themes in order to appeal to a wider audience.<br/><br/>Superheroes have been outlawed since the mid 1970's. The first real superheroes appeared in the 1940's and declined during the 1950's, along with the supervillains. Then came Dr. Manhattan, the first (and only) superhero with powers. Dr. Manhattan is a living God, with the power to do almost anything. He leads the United States to victory in the Vietnam War and gives them the edge in the Cold War. Dan Dreiberg, aka Nite Owl II and Laurie Jupiter, aka Silk Specter II (named after her mother) retire after the Keene Act is passed. Adrian Veidt, aka Ozymandias, the smartest man in the world, reveals his identity and becomes a successful corporate businessman.<br/><br/>Watchmen begins like the comic, with the murder of Edward Blake, aka the Comedian, one of the last two superheroes working for the government. The vigilante detective Rorschach investigates the murder, and suspects someone is picking off costumed heroes. A Bay of Pigs situation develops in the Middle East when the USSR invades Afghanistan, and everybody panics about a Nuclear War breaking out. Rorschach suspects someone wants the old superheroes out of the way so they can't stop it. What proceeds is essentially a character study of all the superheroes I have mentioned thus far. What would these superheroes be like in the real world?<br/><br/>The Comedian is portrayed brilliantly. He is essentially the antithesis of Captain America. He sees the human race as savage and selfish, and sees the world as a joke. Rorschach is the most memorable character in the movie. Jackie Earl Haley delivers the best performance, even though his face is covered for most of the film. He is what Batman would be like in the real world. Patrick Wilson gives an admirable performance as Nite Owl, the most normal and relatable of all the superheroes. Malin Akerman is a bore as Silk Specter. Billy Crudup is good as Dr. Manhattan but his performance is overshadowed by the special effects. Manhattan sees the world on a Quantum level, and sees time as simultaneous. He is so existential he loses touch with the way humans see the world. Matthew Goode does not resemble Ozymandias at all and doesn't leave a strong impression. <br/><br/>I must commend Snyder for meticulously recreating the look of the comic book. Everything looks just like the comic. The opening credits outline the history of the first superheroes very well in a short period of time. The choice of Bob Dylan's ""The Times they are a changin"" is very appropriate. I particularly liked the recreation of the JFK assassination. <br/><br/>I think Watchmen's loyalty to the source material is part of its downfall, unfortunately. It follows the structure of the comic almost to a tee, but I don't think it works in movie form. The plot develops very slowly because it keeps stopping to give us more background story for the characters. This in part creates a conundrum for any filmmaker: the background is essential for the story, yet it slows down the pace considerably. I feel like a mini-series or a two part movie would have been more appropriate for Watchmen than a single film. <br/><br/>The novel was brilliant for its execution of the story, and if one element is removed it has a big impact on the rest of the story. For example, I think the film lost the atmosphere of panic and impending doom by omitting scenes with New York's citizens that were so great in the novel. To create this atmosphere Snyder relied on ineffective scenes with a Richard Nixon actor in laughable makeup.<br/><br/>Watchmen still has many problems that do not stem from the complexity or enormity of the source material, however. Some of Snyder's choices of music are embarrassing or simply distracting. The film is gratuitously violent for no good reason. Snyder sticks in Matrix style action scenes with annoying slow motion that certainly make the film longer than necessary. This style contradicts the very premise of the source material, the deconstruction of the superhero genre. <br/><br/>I had some major problems with the ending. Considering how slow they built up to it, the ending was very rushed. It comes across as an Independence Day action scene rather than a tragedy. Even worse, the changes to the ending exhibited a misunderstanding of the characters, which is strange considering how accurate the movie was up until this point. *Major Spoilers* Dan tries to protect Rorschach from Dr. Manhattan, delivers a clichéd ""NOOOO!"" and proceeds to beat up Ozymandias, thereby reinforcing the notion that these are typical superheroes, a total deviation from the source material. Rorschach dying alone symbolized his estrangement from reality and reminds us that while he may have had the moral high ground in this instance, he was still not an admirable person. Dan and Laurie comforting each other after the tragedy made them more vulnerable, realistic people who need to put aside their vigilante duties once in a while. But no, Snyder made them angry because that is how the audience would feel. Ozymandias does not express any shred of doubt like he does in the comic, which would have helped his character. Snyder did not have the guts to portray the characters this way because it was unconventional.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Watchmen is loyal to the comic in many respects, but it suffers from bad pacing and conventional direction."
"barryjaylevine","7","1","3","12 March 2009"," Pretty good film (and I'm not a fan-boy)
","Just came home from the show. I haven't read the comic novel nor knew anything about this except the teasers which I've seen on TV (or before feature films in the theater). So all I'm going to comment on is what was presented to me on the screen this afternoon.<br/><br/>Very interesting characters; the back story on each was necessary and well done. While there were a few minor details that were left unexplained, my son (who did read the comic novel) explained them to me after the movie and I felt the director was correct in leaving them out of the movie; they were unimportant.<br/><br/>However, I will state the obvious: This movie is w-a-y long; probably too long, IMHO. As I'm not carrying the baggage of the fan-boys, I could see a few ways of cutting 30 minutes out of the film and making it even more compelling (although I'm not saying the film was painfully long - except maybe for my bladder). But The Dark Knight was also a bit on the long side yet compelling so these directors have a vision and that's why they're hired, right? I don't want to give away any secrets or ruin any surprises. The characters are (mostly) very complicated and Rorschach...wow...Jackie Earle Haley is wonderful in that role. Let's just say he's the roughest, toughest SOB I've seen in the movies in a long time. I'd nominate Haley for a Best Supporting Actor award; and I think that's what I will remember about this film.<br/><br/>The producers should be happy that all of the money they spent (well, except for that nonsense about who actually owned the rights) was right up there on the screen. Lots of special effects, plenty of red paint (y'know, blood) and it didn't feel like anyone phoned in their acting.<br/><br/>So, from an old guy who's not a fan-boy (of this franchise, anyway), I'll recommend you go see it but DON'T BRING ANYONE UNDER 13 as this will definitely give them bad dreams."
"Dragonsouls","10","1","3","11 March 2009"," Spiritual and motivating film depicting superheroes as gods
","I am a science fiction author and the timing of this film couldn't have been better. I am currently working on a superhero story and after watching this spectacular film, I find myself going back to the drawing boards because the stories are very similar.<br/><br/>Enough about that, lets talk about this phenomenon. It is groundbreaking film directing and Zack Snyder is now officially a genius. After watching 300, I gave most kudos to his video editing software, but now it's official, he is the next Kubrick. Big words yes, but coming from a Kubrick fan, and I really mean it.<br/><br/>The acting here is good enough to draw you into feeling for the characters. The problem is that there is too many of them, and the film should be a bit longer even though the theatrical cut is long for some. Personally, I would have sat in the theater for another 2 hours. The film gives you great special effects, set design, and most of all atmosphere. Snyder wraps this all together in a package filled with philosophical debate, centered around the nature of humanity and our imminent future. A dark future it is, mostly because we are destroying our planet with primitive energy sources, and if we develop free energy, we might save the planet but destroy ourselves, because humanity isn't mature enough to handle such power.<br/><br/>I wanted to talk about the soundtrack, which is excellent. Lots of eclectic music, mixed in with some Rock and Roll. Some bashed the idea of including such popular songs, but I loved the songs and the music adds to the film's emotional scenes. Most of the film is in the past, showing how the watchmen came to an end. Each character gets a backdrop story, and in the end, all the drama intersects and all the characters find their judgment day. Even the all-mighty Dr. Manhattan will face his demons in the end, and proves that even a perfect man is never really perfect and perfection doesn't really exist permanently.<br/><br/>I don't recommend children watch this film because of the violence and gore. Some of it unnecessary and I guess Snyder needed to be free with his R rating. I do recommend this to everyone above 18, it's a must watch because people need to keep their brains on when watching a film, not shut them off. If you disagree, go watch the Fantastic Four! 10 out of 10. Groundbreaking visual masterpiece, and a story on par with Clash of the Titans, Jason and the Argonauts, and even the Ten Commandments."
"seanduffy98","9","1","3","11 March 2009"," Awesome Cinema!
","OK, let's get this out of the way......I have not read the much lauded graphic novel and went to see Watchmen from a completely neutral perspective. I thought Zach Snyder's two previous movies movies were awesome. The re-imagining of Dawn Of The Dead was brilliant (and I love the original Romero film) and '300' was like nothing I've ever seen before. So I went to see his celluloid version of Watchmen with a sense of trepidation and excitement. Firstly, those people who have posted negative reviews probably think films like 'Armageddon' and 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop' are cinematic masterpieces! The visual style of this film is stunning and surprisingly the use of CGI is limited (apart from the obvious portrayal of Dr Manhattan). The main characters are superbly realised and the acting is top notch. The standout characters for me were the aforementioned Dr Manhattan( a superbly understated Billy Crudup), Rorschach (a stunningly psychotic Jack Earle Hayley) and The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). The rest of the superheroes are also superb and I really cannot fault any of the actors all playing difficult roles. Much has been said of Malin Ackerman's 'botched' portrayal of Silk Spectre II......don't buy into this, she is good and super sexy in this pivotal role. I also thought Patrick Wilson was excellent as Night Owl II and Matthew Goode was superb as Ozymandias, the so called smartest person in the world. This film makes great use of the period music and is brutally violent in places but don't let that put you off! Having not read the comic, I found myself drawn in by the characters and plot and didn't find it confusing at all. There is a great twist that I didn't see coming and the much maligned 'alternate' ending fits so well with the film that the ridiculous space squid ending in the comic would have been misguided. This film is nowhere near perfect....there is a ridiculously OTT sex scene which drew lots of unintentional laughs and Richard Nixon's make up is pretty poor but overall the film was as good as I expected, if not better!<br/><br/>All I can say is kudos to Zach Snyder for tackling a movie that was initially deemed unfilmable and I don't think ANYONE could've done a better job! Go see this film with an open mind and don't expect a Spiderman or even the ultra-successful Dark Knight type superhero flick and you won't be disappointed."
"Grant_Price","8","1","3","11 March 2009"," I don't hear the Comedian telling any jokes. Even Rorschach told one.
","A mere twenty one years after the comic book was first published, the screen adaptation of the greatest graphic novel of all time (obviously I've read them all) is here and, with the exception of the entirely fatuous sex scene and questionable soundtrack choices, Watchman rules. The direction and cinematography is amazing; each scene has been expertly crafted and lavished with colours to mirror the panels in the comic book to such a degree that it would be pretty much impossible for any idiot fan boy to complain Alan Moore's original vision has been changed at all. There is only one major change to the story, the climax, which actually makes more sense. Plus, director Zach Synder hasn't slowed down two thirds of the film just to go ""Hey, you guys overtly suppressing their homosexual urges through sporadic outbursts of testosterone fuelled violence! Check out this action sequence! You can literally see everything that's happening, just in a slow and incredibly boring way!"" as he did for 300. Instead, every scene flows perfectly and the slow-motion is only used when necessary, like for an unprovoked murder. Plus, the cast personify their graphic novel alter-egos meritoriously, particularly Jackie Earle Haley who takes the iconic character of Rorschach and somehow makes him illimitably cooler than he was in the novel.<br/><br/>However, there is a noticeable problem. It lies in the story. Oh gasp. What resonance does a story involving the impending apex of the Cold War and mutually assured destruction for all have in today's society as it did when it was written amidst the end of détente, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Olympic boycotts, billion dollar Strategic Defense Initiatives, nuclear stockpiling and so on? It doesn't have any. While there are indeed still problems such as nuclear stockpiling, further wars in Afghanistan and communist threats (referring to the metaphorical abortion that is North Korea), there is conversely nothing like the paranoia that gripped people with regard to these issues twenty years ago. Thus, Watchmen is unfortunately caught in a Catch-22 situation. If it had been made in the 1980s, it would've looked like Howard the Duck. Probably. Being made today, it can offer no substantial critique on society and is merely a series of pretty pictures set in a time that the majority of the audience know nothing about. It doesn't ruin the film, it is just frustrating to see that a film with a story as intelligent as this has had its message reduced to the same comic book level as The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Returning to the good stuff, it is refreshing to see that Zach Synder has not compromised his film in any way with regard to length and violence. At nearly three hours long the running time may alienate a lot of people but is incredibly rewarding for those who do choose to see it as Watchmen does not become boring even once. Not even the aforementioned sex scene is tedious as it is dealt with so badly (including the use of the pervasive 'Hallelujah' which never needs to be heard by anybody ever again) that it makes you glad Synder tried (but failed) to ruin the film with it. Concerning the violence, it isn't the typical comic-book standard. Incarnadine fountains of life force are routinely expelled across the screen, ivory shafts of splintered bone protrude from bodies like colonial flagpoles from an antediluvian age and people get blown up real good. This is accompanied on the whole by an underlying dark humour which goes some way to validating the gratuity. Pleasing.<br/><br/>As a screen adaptation of an 'unfilmable' graphic novel, Watchmen is visually perfect. Every nuance on every panel has been studied and transferred to film. Everything fits except the story, with the Zeitgeist having little relevance today. But, in answer to the immemorial question ""Who watches the Watchmen?"", I would say ""hopefully anyone who doesn't find a two metre long blue penis funny."" So nobody."
"Stevebuerk","6","1","3","11 March 2009"," Another example that 1:1 adaptations of comic books don't work
","I would love to give ""Watchmen"" a better rating than I did. I really would.<br/><br/>All the love for detail, the great casting (except for Matthew Goode whose mumbling clearly betrays portraying the ""smartest man in the world""), you can see how much effort went into the attempt to create an exact adaption of the graphic novel.<br/><br/>But that's also the problem I see in this movie. The dialogue seems artificial and campy at times. Some of the best lines, this movie has to offer are in moments when Snyder lets his writers step away from the novel. (""I'm not locked in here with you! You're locked in here with me!"") It was just painful for me to watch the movie constantly returning to the back-story of the characters when I longed for development in the main plot. Even in the end, a secret in one of the character's back-story is revealed, that is of absolutely no interest, because of the main plot's magnitude.<br/><br/>As I said: I'd love to rate this one better. Just for the guts to make it. But that would betray the feeling I had when watching the movie an afterwards. And that was mostly boredom. Mixed with disappointment."
"LoneWolfAndCub","8","1","3","10 March 2009"," An ambitious adaptation of a seemingly impossible to adapt graphic novel
","Zack Snyder, the man behind 2004's Dawn of the Dead and 300, is a brave man. Alan Moore, who wrote the Watchmen series, created something truly original with his series and in doing so received huge acclaim and a legion of fans. This movie was always going to be hard in many ways, and I do not just mean creating an alternate world with so many characters, but pleasing fans and newcomers as well. Personally, I think he's mostly succeeded but falls just short on both fronts. Before going to see this I made sure I had read the series so I could make fair comparisons after so I did go in expecting more than some may have. Although the film runs for 163 minutes, Snyder has left a fair amount out from the novels (mainly character development) and although this is understandable to keep the running time reasonable many interesting and important parts have been left out which is a slight letdown. For the uninitiated Watchmen may seem to convoluted and complex at times but honestly, it should not prove too difficult for its target audience.<br/><br/>A brief rundown for those who do not know; Watchmen is set in the 80's in a different world to ours. Richard Nixon is serving another term as president and costumed superheroes are a part of everyday life. The U.S.A. is on the brink of nuclear war with the Soviets, which is kept track of by the Doomsday Clock, which is set to 5 minutes to midnight when the film starts. Amongst all this, someone is trying to kill the Watchmen, and they start with The Comedian/Edward Black (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Rorschach (Jackie Earle Hayley), another Watchmen, is determined to unravel the mystery and catch the murderer before the others are killed as well.<br/><br/>I will not go into anymore detail as that would spoil the intricate and layered story. David Hayter and Alex Tse have done a very good job with screenplay, mixing in many genres and great dialogue. Action, drama, romance and film-noir are blended with a mix of violence to make for a riveting cinematic experience which is entirely original and authentic. It is not often a film comes along and is so different to everything else at the time that when it does many people will rave about it. Please, do not raise your expectations at all as that will risk disappointment. Go in neutral and come out blown away as many people I know have.<br/><br/>For those that are worried that this will be like all the other superhero movies and follow the same formula of: good guy battles villain while chasing a love interest and facing personal demons. This is in a league of its own; all the ""heroes"" are normal people with their own agendas and their own way of dealing with situations. The ""villains"" are not paper cut-outs, they are more complicated than the other ""let's destroy/rule the world"" clichés. Yes, there are personal demons within all the heroes and villains, but they are much deeper and darker than any other character you will find in any other comic book. Of course, the characters are brought to life by a bunch of incredibly talented actors. Patrick Wilson (Nite Owl II) is excellent as an average guy who can't get it on with the Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman) unless he is costumed. He's man who longs for the days of crime-fighting. Ackerman is quite good in her role as the only female fighter who has a dark family history. Billy Crudup (Dr. Manhattan) does very well for a man who spends the movie as a naked blue man who actually has powers (teleportation, duplication) and tragic past. He brings depth to a character who could have been nothing but a ""guy with powers."" <br/><br/>Before I end the review, a word of advice, do not take the children to see this movie, because unlike X-Men, Batman or Spiderman this is not as kid-friendly. Similar to 300, Watchmen contains a LOT of stylised, brutal violence with loads of blood and gore. Think broken bones, graphic stabbings and shootings, exploding bodies and severed limbs.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has created a unique and simply awesome movie in Watchmen, and although it is not going to please everyone, it is definitely one of the best movies of the year so far and the most original of the past decade. Go see this one soon! 4/5"
"rjyelverton","6","1","3","9 March 2009"," A fascinating misfire
","Some of ""Watchmen"" is brilliant. Set in 1985 in a world where Richard Nixon was elected to multiple terms and men and women with super powers helped us win the Vietnam War, the US is on the brink of nuclear war with the Soviets. Those with super powers have not made the world better--we see this in ""The Dark Knight"" as well--and, in fact, have helped make it worse. In this plot point we see an argument against the still going weapons race--it leads to escalation, increased danger instead of safety--played out on screen. The development and eventual weaponizing of the the super powerful Dr. Manahattan, able to reconstitute matter at will, raises tensions with the Soviets leading us to the brink of annihilation.<br/><br/>This is the game and stakes as ""Watchmen"" opens. A costumed hero will be murdered sending the Travis Bickle-like Rorschach into action as he sets out to solve the mystery. Rorshcach sees the world in black and white--mostly black--and he the avenging angel giving no quarter to the ""scum"" of the city. His investigation leads him to interview other costumed heroes and in this way we witness a host of origin stories and learn the dark secrets of many of the superpowered. Unfortunately, the film telegraphs its villain a little too clearly so then we are only left with trying to discern motive.<br/><br/>Snyder's theme, by way of the Alan Moore novel, seems to be that the superpowered are not heroes and so much ability consolidated into only a few individuals is good for none and leads to the emergence of a fascist class. Snyder seems to be be bringing this theme to the fore as he shows heroes mangle the bodies of the unjust. They burst limbs open and hack into villains with seeming ease and glee. The scenes are repulsive and I'm willing to go along with the director if the harrowing violence is meant to show how depraved these heroes actually are. It's an invigorating, if not pleasant, reimagining of the super hero genre.<br/><br/>But then Snyder tips his hand and it becomes clear that the bloodbath and wallowing in the gore is, as in the ridiculous ""300,"" meant to be violent ballet. And it's not so much the violence that bothers me--I loved Snyder's unsentimental ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake--but how its inclusion lays waste to all the nuance that has come before. This fact crystallizes in a prison scene where Rorschach, the Silk Spectre, and Nite Owl escape from a prison riot and are clearly having fun as they hack off limbs with power saws and beat enemies to a pulp. The movie then tries to return to profundity, but it is now clear that Snyder's slo-mo, bone crunching is the point of the film. The Moore novel provides Snyder a pretext for heroes beating the snot out of their inferiors.<br/><br/>There is brilliance in the film, however. The opening credit sequence is a wonder as it lays out a dense backstory in just a few minutes. It reminded of DeVito's incendiary opening monologue in ""L.A. Confidential."" The set decoration and costuming bring the world of the classic novel to life and this is sure to please its most ardent fans. Jackie Earle Haley, unsettling in ""Little Children,"" nails Rorschach and Billy Crudup as the god-man Dr. Manhattan is sufficiently cold and distant. Dr. Manhattan's transformation from man to weapon is tragic and the movie's high point.<br/><br/>So much works in the film, but its stylized violence undercuts its themes. A fascinating misfire not for the squeamish."
"Kasimagj","5","1","3","9 March 2009"," Well done, but highly overrated
","Alright, I am very open minded when it comes to watching movies but this one had me cringing to walk out the door 20 minutes into the movie. The special affects are very well done, along with the cinematography. I strongly believe that IF you haven't read the novel or are familiar with the story line...you will be confused for 90% of the movie. If you plan to go see a movie similar to a Marvel or DC superhero movie with intense action of fighting villains...THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. If you are on the fence about this movie, I recommend waiting until it's on blueray because this movie is for a very select crowd. Another reason for waiting to rent this movie: it's almost 3 hours long. If you're not impressed by the first half hour of the movie, you're going to be in for a long painful ride. I must have seen a dozen people walk out of the theater before the movie ended. BOTTOM LINE: A long, confusing, well done movie for a very select crowd."
"David_Frames","6","1","3","8 March 2009"," Less is Moore
","Alan Moore's beef with Hollywood is that it's a crudifying monster  its arms entering the spectator's mind through the eyes and once inserted, frenzied and aimless, pulping the grey matter contents into a kind of wit resistant batter which is no more capable of processing the dense psychological and social preoccupations of his work than wood can hope to ferry electricity.<br/><br/>For Moore, willfully ignorant in an effort to protect his own authorship, cinema just isn't up to it. The detail of each panel within the humble comic book is a gallery of ideas and story specific detail that you, yes YOU the grateful reader, pore over at your leisure, like the fine art connoisseur plotting their time through a superb exhibition and breathing in each piece in turn. This notion that film, by its very nature, is reductive in translation and confected on delivery, has lead the co-author of Watchmen to suggest that his 1986 graphic novel was ""unfilmable"". For the record, that's senseless toss but this adaptation isn't going to change his mind. It's not the mode of translation that's at fault  film is a perfectly viable tool for the job, it's the way that tool has been used.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a fascinating view because it vividly illustrates several of the problems transferring material between two visual art forms that rely on significantly different patterns of consumption and interpretation to work.<br/><br/>Dave Gibbons, who illustrated the 12-part series on which this is based, was, unlike Moore, happy to be credited and that's hardly surprising because Zack Snyder has used his art work like a storyboard, compensating for the rapidity of the moving image where appropriate, with fits of slow motion, designed to recall the experience of forensically eyeballing those all important panels. It is, superficially at least, a good technique, reverent to the original and designed to fluff the fanboys who will have envisioned it thus and will be in a furious masturbatory frisson as a result. Were this the only barometer, Watchmen would be a qualified success but its problems are manifest in those areas that required an artist rather than the fan at the helm  a director rather than a acolyte - narrative, backstory, tone; the elements of the graphic novel that, somewhat counter intuitively, may have benefited from a less straitjacketed approach.<br/><br/>Watchmen the graphic novel acknowledges the limitations of the medium, whether it knows it or not, by fortifying each part with written extracts from various fictional sources  a former super heroes autobiography, a police report, a magazine article  all of which add texture to the characterization and flesh out the stories alternative timeline. Inevitably the three act Hollywood picture isn't the easiest framework within which to add these deets, so what to do? Émigré directors of the 30s and 40s working in Hollywood (and a few of the natives), overcame these sorts of problems by investing scenes with expressionistic composition and shadow, which married with incisive, witty dialogue, hinted at what couldn't be shown or seen, and consequently your imagination became the bridge and added the depth. The result? Film Noir  the perfect fusion of artistry and suggestion and some of the finest American films ever made.<br/><br/>Snyder knows he has a problem in this respect but sentimentally in thrall to the source, is incapable of making the decisions that might have saved his bacon. It's a matter of hitting the same psychological points in the story but with greater subtlety than a word for word transfer allows. Much of the dialogue is lifted from Moore's script, but what works within the context of the comic book, feels clunky and coarse when it exits the mouths of real human beings. Rorschach is the case in point. On paper he's brooding, introspective and psychotic  on screen he speaks the same words, does the same things but has a pantomime quality that errs toward the ridiculous. Too often, when unable to mark out his roadmap to the story's political and socio-satirical cues, Snyder's instinct is to go for crunching violence and spectacle (as well as adding inches to Doctor Manhattan's flaccid penis not a bad metaphor for his approach), perhaps hoping to overpower the viewer's undernourished cerebellum. He'll say the noise is all on the page of course, and it is, but what felt cutting in the novel's more fully realised world, looks like a blunt instrument on screen. It isn't that you can't film it, you just can't do like this, but it's another case study to add to the files on the issue of how the filmmakers best equipped to replicate the EXPERIENCE of these stories, are seldom the ones who actually have an interest in doing so."
"SiPayn","8","1","3","9 March 2009"," Who will watch Watchmen?
","Firstly I'd like to dwell on the things that I really enjoyed about 300 director, Zack Snyder's epic adaptation of Moore and Gibbons seminal classic novel Watchmen.<br/><br/>From the initial brilliant opening montage set to ""The times they are a'changin"" by Bob Dylan, Snyder establishes the mode and tone of Watchmen, and manages to convey the feeling of dread that humanity is living under, the threat of nuclear war. The casting for the most part is excellent, the main actors bringing their comic counterparts to life and each of them helps define and convey the deconstructed super hero archetype that they are meant to portray well, and Snyder has remained remarkably faithful to the source material. Visually the film is stunning to look at, and with the notable exception of Hallelujah during Laurie and Dan's shagfest, the score is excellent as well, including some witty touches like a muzak version of ""Everyone wants to rule the World"" by Tears for Fears during the assassination attempt on Adrian.<br/><br/>It is perhaps this last bit that causes some of the issues that I have with the GN. I will admit as a complete fan-boy of the source material that I couldn't see how one could remain too faith to the GN, but here because of several sub-plots that have been necessarily axed, and Snyder's want to remain as faithful as possible, I as the viewer felt somewhat detached from the viewing experience, rather than being immersed in Watchmen's story. I found myself listening to dialogue lifted from the page, which in the context of other material sounded fine, but with some of the other back story and sub-plots lifted felt forced and clunky.<br/><br/>I do think that this detachment will be helped greatly by additional material which will be in the director's cut of the film, which will become available on DVD later this year.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a flawed, but ambitious and wonderful attempt to get the source material on screen. The acting is good and in JEH and JDM's cases very very good, and Snyder has delivered the world of Watchmen to our screens brilliantly. I would recommended people see it, but frankly I'd wait for the director's cut which I think will iron out many of the quibbles I had about the film.<br/><br/>7.5/10."
"bjohnt","9","1","3","7 March 2009"," Visually and psychologically stunning!

All of the actors were phenomenal, Jackie Earl Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Billy Crudup, and Patrick Wilson. The only actors who I thought lacked a bit was Malin Ackerman and Matthew Goode, they weren't bad, but weren't the best compared to the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The bad.

"lancestlaurent","8","1","3","7 March 2009"," Among the Most Fantastic Adaptations Ever Produced
","The experience of viewing Watchmen on the big screen has stuck with me since the beautiful opening credits graced the screen set to the soft sounds of Dylan's The Times They are A'Changin. I'll be straightforward, Watchmen is, at least to me, a near-masterpiece that will satisfy the expectations of even the most scrutinizing fanboy, but still is accessible enough for an intelligent general audience to enjoy.<br/><br/>If your reading this, you probably are somewhat aware with the plot of Watchmen, so I won't waste words trying to explain the deep complexities of this film or the graphic novel on which it is based, but, I will try to analyze the individual aspects of the film. Since I'm on story I'll start with the screenplay. David Hayter and Alex Tse have done the impossible. They took one of the most densely packed pieces of literature and managed to whittle it down to a brisk two hours forty- three minutes, and in doing so still capturing the spirit of the book. Even the most scrutinizing Watchmen fan could not notice most of the changes to the book. Some are slightly more obvious, *coughSQUIDcough*, but most are incredibly subtle and do not detract from the story. Nearly every character big and small was able to develop into fully-fledged human beings that one can identify with.<br/><br/>This leads me to my next subject, the acting. The cast is mostly unknown outside of the realm of film geekery. This is to the film's advantage as it lets the actors connect more with the characters. Nearly all of the performances were spot-on with special mention going to Jackie Earl Haley for completely embodying Rorschach body and soul and to Billy Crudup for taking the character of Dr. Manhattan and making him his own. I have only minor quibbles with the duo of Carla Gugino and Malin Akerman playing Silk Spectre I and II respectively. Gugino has a tendency to overdo it a bit with her portrayal, while Akerman has the opposite problem, occasionally sounding whiny or apathetic. Nevertheless, Watchmen's cast goes above and beyond expectations.<br/><br/>Next, the music choices. Tyler Bate's original score is reminiscent of Vangelis's work on Blade Runner, but is often times underused in lieu of period appropriate music. These choices range from stunning(Nat King Cole, the aforementioned Dylan) to questionable(Leonard Cohen' Hallelujah seems out of place), but are mostly effective.<br/><br/>Finally, the biggie, how is Zack Snyder? Some have called his previous works sophomoric and immature, but boy did Snyder put on his big boy pants for this one. Maturing in nearly every way, but still with the distinctive flair for visuals, Snyder creates scenes with pastels you would swear were drawn by Dave Gibbons. But, the man is still a perv for slow-mo. But fear not, he restrains mostly restrains himself, using the speed ramping sparingly to create a living comic feel at times. The gore in this movie seemed significantly stronger than in the book, and this is sometimes to the movie's detriment, but most of the action scenes are beautifully choreographed and not excessive in their violence. But the true strengths of Watchmen lie not in its action, but in its characterization and its creation of a completely separate universe from our own. The detail throughout the movie is incredible to almost OCD levels. This can all be traced back to Zack Snyder's love of the source material and his affectionate handling of it.<br/><br/>To be honest, I want to watch Watchmen again to take in the many layers of this story. Like last summer's The Dark Knight, Watchmen transcends its genre to create a lasting piece of art that sends speaks inherent truths about us as a society. It is not for everyone, but I believe that everyone should see it at least once.<br/><br/>Lance St. Laurent 9/10 <br/><br/>P.S. If you get the chance to experience this film in Imax, do so. It is stunning on the big, big screen."
"dee.reid","9","1","3","7 March 2009"," Watching ""Watchmen""...
","I felt that a near-impossible feat had been achieved: that director Zack ""Dawn of the Dead remake/'300'"" Snyder had been behind the camera of an adaptation of the ""Watchmen"" graphic novel series co-created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, and ran for 12 issues between 1986 and 1987. That Snyder was even able to bring the comic book series to the big screen was an achievement in and of itself, since many have felt that a ""Watchmen"" movie would be, for lack of a better word, impossible; I'm inclined to agree. So read on.<br/><br/>As a comic book reader, and ""Watchmen"" fan, ""Watchmen"" has the distinction of being the only comic book to appear on ""Time Magazine's"" 100 Best Novels List, and likewise, it's been hailed by comic book fans as a milestone in comic book fanfare, while philosophers, writers, and essayists have taken it upon themselves to dissect this epic tome of graphic literature for their pleasure, education, and amusement - all for our sake. The series is world-renowned for its incredibly and crudely realistic (and sometimes satirical) portrayal of superheroes in the real world - many of the main characters were sexually and emotionally frustrated/confused, while others were psychotic and socio-pathic - how they perceived themselves and each other, how they were perceived by the world at large, and the futility of vigilantism in an out-of-control world, as well as building up a chilling expose of Cold War-era fears and paranoia in a world that lay on the brink of nuclear war.<br/><br/>Does all this translate well into Snyder's film? Yes. But there-in potentially lies the film's greatest flaw: that's all it is, a translation, nothing more. It brings nothing new to the table in terms of characters or story, or the series' deeply engrossing subtext. Don't get me wrong. I liked ""Watchmen""; on one hand, the movie is a visual splendor filled with terrific special effects and portrayals of the main characters that are faithful to the series. The dialogue, for the most part, is well-written and equally well-delivered by the actors. And the length (162 min.) didn't bother me the way that it should have. It kept me interested throughout (like the comic book), unlike the problem I had sitting through ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), which was only about 10 minutes shorter than this film.<br/><br/>On the other hand, as I stated earlier, the movie brings nothing new to the table as a means of trying to draw in new viewers (e.g., people who don't read comic books). It seems as if Snyder and company looked at Moore and Gibbons's graphic novel, put it under a magnifying glass, and just directly translated what was on the page to the screen (specific frames from the comic were replicated almost exactly in the film - right down to the littlest, finest detail - you'll know which ones they are when you see them). Moore has been against the idea of a ""Watchmen"" film from the get-go (I've been largely skeptical myself since first hearing about an adaptation), and his name didn't appear in the opening credits, just as I had somewhat expected.<br/><br/>Set in an ""alternate"" 1985 in New York City in which Richard Nixon is about to be elected to a third term, the story gets underway when disgraced former superhero Edward Blake/The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is thrown out of his apartment window and makes a big red stain on the sidewalk below. Investigating his murder, is the socio-pathic masked vigilante - and my personal favorite Watchman - Walter Kovacs/Rorschach (the perfectly cast Jackie Earle Haley). As the mystery deepens, he begins to suspect a conspiracy to off ""masks"" (superheroes), which leads him into something even more terrifying, something in which the fate of the world is at stake, and he takes his findings to megalomaniac and former colleague and fellow superhero Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), now the most respected scientific mind on the planet.<br/><br/>Calling upon old allies such as Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) and Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre II (Carla Gugino) is out of the question because they're currently involved in their own troublesome issues at the moment, a love triangle, to be specific. Sally begins an affair with Dreiberg because her current lover, the almost god-like Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), is unable to satisfy her either emotionally or sexually. So Rorschach is forced to go it alone most of the time, until circumstances force both Dreiberg and Sally to dawn their costumes one more time to save the world from certain doom.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" is an astounding visual feast; it's a live-action comic book. This is probably the best-looking new feature I've seen this year (in fact, it's the first movie I've seen in the theater this year, period). The special effects, as you would expect, are top-notch, and the makeup and costumes for the actors are first-rate (Rorschach's mask!!!). The problem is with the script. David Hayter (""X2"") co-wrote this vehicle, which takes a few nods in the direction of the thematic complexities of the graphic novel by playing up some of the satire and establishing the main characters and their back-stories rather faithfully. In doing so, a number of the smaller sub-plots (the earlier Minutemen and ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" were engrossing favorites) have been excised, presumably for timing, but the movie's already 2 1/2 hours long; how could a little bit more story hurt? In the larger scheme of things, this might seem like needless nit-picking, so that's all I'll say about that.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" is not a failure in any real sense, but I did expect something more from a comic book film as eagerly anticipated as this one. Rorschach was awesome beyond words, but I wish the filmmakers had been watching these Watchmen just a little closer, but not so much that they wouldn't have the real room they needed to grow off the page and into our imaginations.<br/><br/>9/10"

","By now pretty much everyone knows the story of Watchmen and also the story behind the making of this film, so I feel no need to retread old ground, what is most important here is whether or not the film was a good film. Sad to say that while Watchmen started out with a ton of promise, towards the middle half of the film it begins to fizzle out and become a film full of some simply put obscure artistic choices.<br/><br/>Watchmen, which was directed by Zack Snyder, is first and foremost a well made film, there is no denying that, but where the film finds its problems is in the odd artistic choices made. The film began with an uber serious tone in which I was digging, but towards the middle of the film it began to become almost an obscure comedy that just made no sense with the tone in which they had established so early on in the film. For this reason alone, Watchmen never seemed to recover for me. Even still with this nitpick I found a lot to enjoy with the film. <br/><br/>It was as I said well done as a whole, where at certain spots the cinematography and production design stole the show. As well the heavy thematic material of the graphic novel is still as relevant in its film counterpart as it was on the page. So what's the final verdict?<br/><br/>Watchmen overall is an entertaining film that is worth seeing, but was short of true superhero film greatness due to some just obscure artistic choices.<br/><br/>I give Watchmen a slightly disappointing 7 out of 10!"
"maxsappa","9","1","3","6 March 2009"," 'Watchmen' super-antiheroes with super super super problems!!!
","Snyder's 'Watchmen' is without any doubt a very powerful love letter to the original comic book. Other people have commented on this but it's true: there could not be a more faithful version than this one.<br/><br/>But let's start from the beginning The film is pretty much seen by the point of view of Rorschach (real name Walter Kovacs but don't call him like this or he'll chop you into pieces) a superhero who when investigating on the death of THE COMEDIAN and gets way more than what he bargained for. He, ironically like the other superheroes in this movie, is an anti-superhero. Actually, every single one of these so called 'heroes' are lunatics in their own rights. The aforementioned Rorschach a 'good psychopath', Nite Owl II with his 'sex problem', Dr. Manhattan apathy regarding the livings and hopefully you'll watch this movie so you'll see how colourful and disturbing (or colourless if you want) this list can be.<br/><br/>The story is a very complex thriller which involves every character's past with all of their twists and turns. The combat scenes (which have The Matrix feel to them) are absolutely spectacular  as well as the special effects. When you think that you got it, well you'll get it wrong (unless you have already read the comic book but hey this is cheating) Some characters will seem black and white and then you'll be surprised, shocked, appalled and even pleased when you find out why they behaved in a way or another. The best character is the dark psycho Rorschach  Alone he's worth the whole movie. Although you can't justify what he does you cannot understand his pain. Ah! And let's not forget that he gets the best lines. Well, when at one point in the movie he's in prison one of the prisoners confronts him. Needless to say that he ends badly for the opponent - he gets covered in boiling oil. When the guards (many!) take Rorschach away he yells to the shocked prisoners: 'I'm not locked in here with you! You're locked in here with ME!' 'Watchmen' is far from perfect (no doubt!). The problem is in the middle where the film really drags and the plot doesn't really move anywhere. Some could argue that it is an important moment because a huge number of important details of the story and characters backgrounds are fleshed out  fair enough. Let's mention the sometimes painful over use of the music/song which for many moments made me think that I was watching a series of music videos rather than a film... Fortunately Zack Snyder's doesn't linger too long on these moments andOK, OK I can forgive him because at the very beginning of the flick the history of WATCHMEN's parallel universe/world is told (yes beautifully) with a clever montage and (YES!!!) the song 'The Times They Are A'Changin' by Dylan is perfectly added. What about the sex scene between Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II well let's forget about that one it was definitely more absurd than sexy.<br/><br/>There is not doubt that the universe depicted in this movie could not been handle by pussy cats like Spider Man, Superman or even Batman  the Dark Knight right?! This story is as hyper-real as it could get: Nixon serving is third term in the 80's, cold war between USA and USSR and the true meaning of peace on earth. Is it true that harmony amongst men can be only brought by fear, threats and lies? Watch WATCHMEN and find out..."

All the other characters are dysfunctional as well; as they closely resemble DC comic characters (DC was run out of business by Marvel, who devastated them in a nuclear attack in 1960). These leftovers from the DC universe make the Marvel characters look good by comparison; and I hate Marvel superhero movies. After Superman, its all downhill for me. Thank goodness AI and singularity is coming soon to replace all this kaka of superheroes. The film is an endless parade of senseless violence with no resolution; and my observation is exactly the same as one of the characters portrayed in the film: Bernard, the comic book reader who wasted an hour on some silly, violent pirate fantasy and came to the conclusion ""This makes no sense"" .

","I never read the graphic novel and ended up seeing the movie twice because I enjoyed it so much. The second time I caught the nuances I missed the first time around. This movie was truly thought provoking with its ""Who's Watching the Watcmen?"" theme and questions about the meaning of life itself. The meaning of life question was really embodied in the character of Dr. Manhattan, who was so powerful that he evolved to the point where mankind was less than nothing to him. He had a great line to Ozymandias, ""the world's smartest man"", at the end: ""The world's smartest man is no more a threat to me than its smartest termite."" Ozymandias takes extreme measures to save mankind, such as giving people cancer, killing a former teammate, and obliterating 15 million people and framing Dr. Manhattan in order to ""save billions""! This begs the question raised in the beginning of the film: Who's watching the Watchmen? Who was he to judge which lives could be sacrificed to save mankind? Dr. Manhattan raised even deeper questions: If mankind did get wiped out, would the universe care or even notice? I recommend this for people who enjoy thought provoking movies and not just mindless drivel like the Fantastic Four or Transformers. There's plenty of action (Rorschach was my favorite character)...I would call this movie a cross between the Matrix and Sin City."

","The Watchmen was an amazing piece of cinema history. Never has such a film shown the true nature of mankind,socially,politically, and with such somber honesty. Snyders' visionary take on a classic novel is one of the most powerful re-tellings in a very,long time. The novel focuses on a twisted version of the mid-80's,without Reagan. A group of powerful, and driven heroes are forced to deal with day to day life, war, love, loss, and everything else we as humans face in our lives. The ""heroes"" don't always do the right thing. Sometimes they do the wrong thing for the right reasons, at other times, they do what has to be done,or they make the right choice, for the wrong reasons. For the fans of the Alan Moore book,it captures the essence of the story,and the visuals are simply breathtaking. For non-fans, this movie is powerful, and thought provoking. There is no need for source knowledge, although it helps. As most reviews have said,this is not Spiderman, or Superman. It is dark,heavy, and emotionally taxing (much like the""dark knight."") The characters have an honesty,and depth to them,forcing this movie to be more of a crime/drama, and not another comic book movie. Under different circumstances, the important changes of the 1980's, could have destroyed the world as we know it,not just in a physical sense, but socially. The Watchmen will stand the test of time.(a whole lot more than Spiderman 1,2,or 3) The effects,and costumes could easily have been removed, and you would still be left with a beautiful, hard hitting film,that deals with the true nature of mankind."
"the-movie-guy","5","2","10","5 March 2009"," Not your standard comic-book superhero movie
","(Synopsis) The year is 1985, and the world is on the brink of nuclear annihilation with the ""Doomsday Clock"" being set to 5 minutes before midnight. The superheroes have been retired for many years, when ""The Comedian"" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is murdered by being thrown out of a window to his death. The psychopathic ""Rorschach"" (Jackie Earle Haley) who wears the ever-moving mask begins to investigate the murder and discovers a conspiracy that someone wants to kill the other superheroes. Rorschach goes around warning all of his former costumed colleagues, but they dismiss his warning until Ozymandias ""The World's Smartest Man"" (Matthew Goode) is almost shot by a hit man. The beautiful ""Silk Specter"" (Malin Ackerman) and the ""Nite Owl"" (Patrick Wilson) team up to find the truth. They uncover something much larger than they ever expected.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This is not your standard comic-book superhero movie in which the bad guys are brought to justice and sent to prison, but they are beaten so bad that limbs are broken, brains exposed, and blood is splattered everywhere. You see that not all superheroes are always good, but some kill for the greater good, especially, Rorschach who maliciously uses a meat cleaver to kill a child killer. There is a high level of graphic violence and plenty of gore. The super-powerful Dr. Manhattan just annihilates his enemy. Usually, the world is on the side of the superheroes, but in this case, the world labels them as vigilantes and gives them no respect. Actually, Dr. Manhattan is the only immortal superhero with real superpowers; the rest are human with expert fighting skills but can be killed. The film drags on a bit too long and some of the film feels outdated since we know the real history about Nixon and the Russians. The acting, fight scenes, and special effects were good, but I still left the movie underwhelmed. This is not a kid's movie, and there is a reason it has an R rating.

After watching 300 though, I found this movie a little slow considering all the slow-motion (which got annoying after a while,) the effects and action were still well-done. To me, this movie is the kind of movie where you have to watch it on the big screen before you watch it at home. I saw an early screening in a regular theater, so I plan on watching it again in iMax, even though this is not one of those action flicks you can watch several times like spider-man or transformers. Either way, if you've read the Graphic Novel I can assure you you will possibly enjoy this, like I did, if not, you might be thinking ""where's all the action?""

","Jesus Christ, what an epic movie. THIS is how you do a comic book adaptation.
Watchmen is a three hour film-fest of gritty, alternate-universe, dystopian 80's America. Watchmen takes no shortcuts in storytelling and world-building. Following Alan Moore's original, this film is a faithful adaptation.<br/><br/>Showing a darker side of superheroes (before Amazon's The Boys), Watchmen plays like a detective whodunit. Progressing, Watchmen goes deeper and deeper into the underbelly of this alternate universe. Though there are ""superheroes"" in the movie, very few are ""heroes."" Each character is nuanced and multifaceted. Drama between each of the characters exists and feels real.<br/><br/>How can I even begin to review this epic of a film?<br/><br/>Let's begin with the plot. The plot twists and turns into different directions but all explorations are appreciated. One of the things I use to judge a film is by its antagonist. The villain's motivation in Watchmen feels real and believable. Stuck between a potential nuclear threat with the US & USSR, the villain does what he must to save humanity.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film adds to this dark, seedy underbelly of alt-NYC. Rainy, dark, and gritty scenes dominate this film throughout. Visuals are absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>The action is pure eye candy. Where most superhero films nerf their violence, Watchmen leaves little to imagination. Teeth are broken, legs are blown off, and people blown to bloody bits. I've rarely seen a film like this before.<br/><br/>And the music? Awesomeness in every sense of the word. Could not have thought of better musical options for this film even if I tried. Kudos to Zach Snyder and his crew.<br/><br/>But, there are downsides. I found myself more annoyed at the audio more than anything. The audio ranges from ultra-quiet dialogue to monstrous booming action sequences. While watching this film, I had to reach for the remote many times trying to capture dialogue and turning down the volume during periods of loud violence. Definitely could've been more care done here. But the other aspects of the film make up for this in many other ways.<br/><br/>4.5/5. This is a film for fanboys and newbies alike. Groundbreaking and ahead of its time."
"eeluksw","5","1","4","25 November 2019"," Faithful To A Fault
","I feel pretty confident in saying that the book was better. I don't remember who said it, or where I heard it, but there's an argument against comic book adaptations because while yes, it's a visual medium, the images you see are carefully constructed. They are designed to convey power, weight, and emotion all within a single, efficient, story-moving frame. You do not need to see the connecting actions between frames because your brain fills them in for you. Imagine how a comic book would portray a noggin-smashing uppercut. On the page, you would find the punch at its most kinetic. All that is captured is the climax, and that's all that is needed. Comics are albums of photos all taken at precisely the right moment.<br/><br/>In a film, you have to deal with the wind-up and consequences of that uppercut. There's more room for error. The images onscreen don't match up with the ones constructed in your head. That's no criticism of the film itself, but it's an example of the inherent folly of trying to directly adapt a comic book page by page, as Zack Snyder did here.<br/><br/>I do think Watchmen deserved to be put on the big screen but I also think it deserved something more than a close copy. The comic is wordy, heavily rooted in its own philosophy, with frequent divergences to various characters' backstories. It is, quite simply, a novel, and copying that into a film without jumbling the structure up a little or inventing new scenes for the screen is a risky business, even if it is 3 hours long.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that anyone who hasn't read the story is going to know what the hell is going on for large stretches of time, as there is a ton of world building to do and no time to do it. There's no time for the audience to just sit with the page and take in all the details of the images, as you can with the comic. Things come and they go, as movies do, and this one feels a little overstuffed with detail.<br/><br/>It felt like the film was talking at me for 3 hours instead of easing me into the world, even as a book reader. I just think that could have been cleaned up.<br/><br/>When the performances are decent, the movie can settle into a good rhythm. But Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan is too weak to convey his power and disaffection with humanity. Similarly, Matthew Goode, neither in his appearance nor his performance sells Ozymandias as his physically perfect, frustratingly intelligent comic likeness.<br/><br/>There is a major change in the story's climax that strikes me as wholly unnecessary, but it keeps in line with the themes so it isn't outright sacrilege, but it's pretty lame.<br/><br/>I'm glad this exists. The original story is truly a masterwork and no amount of Zack Snyder can keep that brilliance from shining through. The film is just a bit tiring on the brain is all, and for that I am thankful I didn't decide to go with the Ultimate Cut on this viewing."

"Ziglet_mir","9","1","4","20 December 2016"," A Question of Humanity
","It's been well over 7 years since the release of 'Watchmen' in movie theaters, and as I write this I'm thinking of all the graphic novel and comic book adaptions that have been made in recent years and which ones truly stand above the rest. Of course, there is then the argument of DC's content vs Marvel's, and sure, there will always be devoted individuals who will stick with their preferred company and writers, but some stories are just better than others. Straight up. <br/><br/>I had the privilege of finding the time to get a ticket and see the film on opening weekend, and I'm really glad I did. After watching it the first go around I was surprised how close to the material the adaption stayed, usually a path directors and screenwriters don't walk down frequently, but you can tell the love that Snyder has for the material; how scene after scene there are frames that match the graphic novel to a tee, and nearly every line verbatim. Amazing stuff. After perusing through the 'Watchmen' IMDb page I realize pretty much everything has already been said, but I figure what the hell. On the re-watch and after reading the graphic novel an additional two times over the span of 7 years I have come to appreciate the material even more. <br/><br/>The coolest thing about the Watchmen, and really the highest quality, is the varying dynamic and character philosophies that make each character fit so well into the grand scheme of the film's (and graphic novel's) message. It truly struck me how the 'give-no-mercy', no compromise morality of Rorschach and the leveling-the-playing field, ultimate compromise mentality of Ozymandias makes you think beyond the one dimensional good vs evil. So many arguments can be made for both sides, and we leave the film asking and pondering, ""Wait, what? Who's right? Did he really get away with that? Did he really save more lives by killing others in the process?"" It's like picking the lesser of two evils and this story and its characters (whether in the film or novel format) makes you think, and I effing love that about the 'Watchmen.' It is one of the ultimate dilemmas of humanity--one of the greatest philosophical questions... Just like the old situation goes: You are working at a rail yard. A train is coming in, but you notice there are people ahead working on the track and they don't know the train is coming. On the second track there is one person working and they don't know the train is coming either. The train is coming in way too fast and can't stop. What can you do? No one else is paying attention and you're the only one close enough to the control switch. Do you let the train continue and take the chance with the group working at one end? Or do you divert the train to where the one man is working so less lives are lost? It may seem like an easy answer at first, but there's a lot of content there. I assure you. And as if that isn't enough the allegory and allusion is brimming too. All thanks to the genius of Moore.<br/><br/>Of course, the film misses pretty much all the scenes between the young kid Bernard, and the Newsie old guy Bernard and everything about the Black Freighter, and the plot is slightly altered (which slightly changes the end), but ultimately the message still gets across, and I applaud Snyder and the writers for doing that well. Because in most cases films lose out on the changes that are made, and many loyalists to the original material can never forgive that, but in the case of the 'Watchmen' I think it can be forgiven since so many other things are done incredibly well.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm getting more lenient as I grow older, but the 'Watchmen' jumps from a 8-star rating to a 10--strictly for having excellent story and character study while not giving up on style and original material. A movie that makes you think is always a keeper. I can understand Alan Moore's hate toward adapting written material to film, but I hope one day he can appreciate the same love Snyder has for something he created. It's a job well done, slight changes and all."

This can be attributed to the incredibly smart and cerebral screenplay by David Hayter(Snake?) and Alex Tse, ultimately adapted from the very popular graphic novel. The setting, tone, characters, soundtrack, cinematography all are just spot on. The cast does a great job, I love how real and gritty their performances really were, each cast member played their role perfectly, albeit maybe excepting a few. Some characters were just so well portrayed(Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan) I was baffled at how real these people really were. Rorschach reminded me of a more hateful, less suicidal Travis Bickle, and was played wonderfully by Jackie Earle Haley. But this movie does sometimes wear on the mind, it isn't very accessible or fun(not counting that as a negative). I did watch the Ultimate Edition which had the extra Tales of the Black Freighter, and it was mostly exhausting. The movie also has some very out of place scenes, that made me go, ""huh? why was that there?""<br/><br/>Ultimately, I enjoyed this movie a lot, the duo of Zack Snyder and Larry Fong produce some truly ""Unforgettable"" scenes."
"sebbystone1","7","1","4","5 March 2016"," Snyder does Moore's classic graphic novel justice.
","I was really worried that Snyder's Watchmen film would fail. I started watching it, and throughout the first half an hour I was dreading the possibility of failure. It certainly felt as though Snyder would not live up to expectations.<br/><br/>But when Watchmen got going, it was amazing. The characters were as interesting and complex as in the novel, and in particular I'd like to praise the performance of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. His performance for this film has the same kind of impact as the late Heath Ledger had as the Joker in The Dark Knight. He is not in the movie. He is the movie.<br/><br/>Based on the novel, the story is unsurprisingly very good, and the script can hold many surprises for those who haven't read the comic. The effects aren't ground-breaking, but look the part. The themes of duty and justice work in this film, and I just can't deny the pride I feel for Snyder upon having made this. I'm not his biggest fan, having only seen 300 besides this (and that wasn't especially great).<br/><br/>If you love super hero movies, dystopian futures and gloomy, apocalyptic settings, you should enjoy this. It isn't for everyone; it's pretty violent at times, the soundtrack won't appeal to everyone, and its a long and complex yarn. But nearly everything worked, and I feel that it's a loyal, worthy adaptation of Moore's novel. Read the book first, and if you liked this, give this film a go."
"bradmanson-35549","8","1","4","24 February 2016"," Dark tones and adult content and superheros do we need anything else?
","Yet another entry in the comic book movie genres Watchmen is probably one of the most faithful adaptations that has come out in regards to it's source material. You can literally see the pages of the comic come out on the screen in glorious scenes of political drama, super-powered fist fights and dark, gloomy tones that are accurate to the graphic novel. Watchmen takes place in alternate reality where superheros are outlawed and are forced to hang up their capes or work on project with the government. It shows what would have happened if the Cold War had reached a climax and we were forced to see the worst possible outcome of that era. Watchmen brings forward interesting characters and an interesting premise to make one of the better non DC or Marvel comic book movies and definitely one of the longest. Watchmen allows for dark tones and adult scenes that we don't always get to see in superhero movie due to the kids in the audience. Watchmen has an R rating and definitely deserves it."
"eragonshurtugal-359-806893","9","1","4","8 October 2015"," Excellent
","In preparation for the movie, I read a lot background materials that don't spoil any plot details. After watching it, I don't really think I needed to spend that much efforts. Details of the movie are delivered so clearly and logically that they make sense of themselves without efforts. To the laymen I would still recommend doing a bit of background research though because you might not want to keep grinding your metal gears while enjoying fantastic visuals. Action scenes, though a bit spared, are also top-notch. Overall the movie is excellent. I'm gonna start looking forward to the director's next products."
"joshuadrake-91275","8","1","4","14 September 2015"," The best superhero movie that I've seen in years
","WATCHMEN is a 2009 American neo-noir superhero film directed by Zack Snyder and it stars a supporting cast of Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and also Carla Guigino is in the film as well.<br/><br/>It is an adaptation of the 1986 - 1987 DC Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Gibbons.<br/><br/>The film is set in an alternate history in the year of 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as a group of mostly retired superheroes investigates an apparent conspiracy against them and uncovers something even more grandiose and sinister, while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances.<br/><br/>I love the action in this film and the director stayed true to it's source material and it is really amazing and fantastic to see. It took nearly a few years to get this movie on to the screen and finally principal photography took place in 2007 and concluded on 2008. As with previous film 300, Zack Snyder closed modeled his storyboards on the comic, but chose to not to shoot all of this film using green screens and opted for real sets instead and the film was released on March 6, 2009 and was released on DVD and Blu-Ray on July 21, 2009.<br/><br/>The acting is great and my favorite character in WATCHMEN is Rorschach, played by Jackie Earle Haley and he did a very good job in the part. Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson did struggle in a few scenes, but they were really great and entertaining in this film as Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II.<br/><br/>Matthew Goode plays the perfect hero and villain as Ozymandias and his performance was amazing and spectacular. Billy Crudup plays Doctor Manhattan and his performance was so emotional and sad as hell, but was really great. Carla Guigino is really amazing as Silk Spectre I and she is really great and fantastic in her part. Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian was really amazing and he does not have a lot of screen time, but he is really good and dramatic, but it's a shame that he died in a scene in this film, not the actor, but the part that Dean Morgan plays.<br/><br/>I think the CGI and visual effects were really interesting in this film, along with 300, which I will review soon, this was really amazing for 2009 and this film really did good at the box office, but got a polarized reaction from critics and audiences. Some critics gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews for the dark and unique style on the superhero genre, the cast and the visual effects, while some reacted negatively for the same reason, as well as the R rating for ""strong graphic violence, sexuality, nudity and language"" and this film got a 65% ""fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes and on Metacritic has an averaged score of 56%, but I don't think it should have gotten a mixed and polarized reaction from critics and audiences.<br/><br/>I don't think that is really bad as critics said it to be and it is really good, but the love scene between Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II is a little too romantic because we're seeing their chests and everything, but I just skipped that scene and went on to the next scene, so I would not have to see that part.<br/><br/>Critics also liked and hated this film because of it's run time. The theatrical version is 162 minutes long -- 2 hours and 42 minutes -- and that is an hour and a half long. The director's cut is 186 minutes long -- 3 hours and 8 minutes -- and that's over three hours and a half long. I have not seen the other versions of this film, but I do think that the original version is really cool. In November 2009, a four-disc set was released titled ""Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut"" and this included the director's cut version re-edited with an animated cartoon as featured in the graphic novel, bringing the film's run time to 215 minutes long.<br/><br/>Tyler Bates' musical score is a little confusing to describe because I like it and hate it, but he could have done better, but no hard feelings, right? The rest of the story is really amazing and awesometacular and just really cool as hell.<br/><br/>Overall, WATCHMEN is not the best comic-book film adaptation in the world, it could have been bad, but Zack Snyder and Company did a really great job and I could have not been more pleased. So, I will give it a 8 out of 10."
"ionbatir","10","1","4","11 August 2015"," Review: Watchmen Film Straddles Line Between Loyalty, Heresy
","One could call bringing Watchmen to the big screen a thankless job. In finally adapting the greatest comic ever written, director Zack Snyder has triumphed under pressure where true visionaries like Darren Aronofsky and Terry Gilliam have failed. He has successfully turned Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' brilliant comics mini-series into a must-see movie for every Watchmen fan boy in the land. If only it were that simple. <br/><br/>As a devoted fan of the comic and its writer, it is hard for me to call Watchmen a great film. Caught between its loyalty to the source material and a desire to carve out its own legend, the R-rated epic is a bloody mess with its still-beating heart in the right place. But its head isn't in the game, unless that game is all about marketing blitzes, product tie-ins and raking in Dumpsters full of cash. If those are the stakes, then it's game over: Snyder has locked down the championship win. <br/><br/>Turning Watchmen into a fan-pleasing film was undeniably a daunting task. It could be argued that no one could make a movie that would live up to the comics' dense, meta fictional, inter textual triumph, which effectively deconstructed the superhero genre through its tapestry of flawed characters and bold political themes."
"hallpatt","10","1","4","19 June 2014"," By far, my favorite movie of all time
","I tend to like movies that have a deep and meaningful story to tell, and this one easily takes the cake. It simultaneously challenges people deepest conceptions of superheroes, righteousness, historical purpose, psycho-social behavior, and ultimately ethics/morality. There are so many plots and subplots interwoven nicely in this movie. There are even multiple subtle philosophical interplays that encourage multiple viewings of this movie. The action and suspense are done with glistening polish, and there is the perfect portion of humor interwoven into it. Everything one could ask for is in this movie, and may even change the way you think about your life and role in society.<br/><br/>Of course the comic does do it far better, but a movie may only have a certain runtime (it is not happenstance that my favorite comic and movie are the same). It is indeed unfortunate that the creator (Alan Moore) has refused to watch the stuff that the WB has churned out since he left DC comics, but it is true to his work.<br/><br/>*As an aside, the people who complain about the ""blue penis"" thing, you are playing into the challenge presented by this movie and you failed it. Try to be less narrow-minded, and understand why it was placed there in the first place. There is a lot to unravel here, and you have to think because it will challenge even the most open-minded of sorts, but THAT IS PRECISELY WHY THIS MOVIE IS GOOD. I won't ruin anything by saying why you need to read into its meaning, or what there is (that's in the eye of the beholder). Try to see these things as a sociological challenge, and you might be surprised at what you'll see on the 1st or even 15th viewing."
"theperfectmarysuekiller","10","1","4","9 April 2014"," This is one of the greatest of all superhero movies
","A few weeks ago, this movie happened to cross my mind and I decided to watch it. It turns out that nothing could make me regret this decision.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck me was how the movie began. The comedian is thrown out of his high rise apartment by an unseen assailant. The scene that follows traces through time to show an alternate time line and was incredibly well done. Later, we see the origin of Dr. Manhattan in flashback, and we see his relationship with Janie Slater before he becomes the energy being he is in the movie's present. There is an emotional energy here rarely seen in most other movies, and the cinematography is perfect for the film.<br/><br/>Another thing that really stood out to me was the realism of the story and how it played seriously all the threats that the US faced in the time line of the story. The vigilantes play an important part revolving around this part of the story, investigating the Comedian's death and discovering the conspiracy.<br/><br/>This movie stands out most, however, because of the story and how it handles several heavy moral issues. The characters are smart and competent, but rarely heroic and often flawed, selfish human beings. The villain isn't clear until the end, and even works with one of the heroes. In the movie, Ozymandias works with Dr. Manhattan to create a sort of machine that would solve the world's energy problems and supposedly eliminate the threat of nuclear war. However, Ozymandias realizes that a source of energy is too little, too late to stop full blown nuclear war, given that the doomsday clock is four minutes to midnight and ticking. He knows that Dr. Manhattan sees his own time line simultaneously through the past, present and future, so he uses the machine as a weapon to create particles that travel backwards in time and disrupt his unusual perception of time. <br/><br/>When Manhattan finds out,he is too late. This conveniently allows Ozymandias to pin the blame on Manhattan to unite the world against the perceived threat of Dr. Manhattan. He succeeds in averting nuclear war, but at the cost of millions of lives. Manhattan is also forced to incinerate Rorshach, who threatens to reveal the conspiracy, which would negate the aversion of the war because of his stance: ""Even in the face of Armageddon, never compromise."" The end shows cities being rebuilt and humanity having a better hope for the future.<br/><br/>This movie is undoubtedly dark, with no completely clear right and wrong. The violence is brutal and sometimes disturbing. But there is so much more than what I just described here. It is also a detailed character study and a much more realistic take on the superhero genre. The characters and their personalities are diverse and contrast well. The plot involves all characters at some point and you are likely to get more out of this with every view. In conclusion, this movie does something rare for superhero movies and works as an incredible addition to the genre. Being visually striking, having great music, performances by a talented cast and incredible action are only the tip of the iceberg here.<br/><br/>Also, you may hear that this movie is ""just a needlessly violent, sexual and depressing knock off of The Incredibles."" First, this is based on a graphic novel that was released long before Pixar was formed. Second, this actually takes an unflinching look at tough moral and ethical questions without providing the answers. Third, the kind of people who say that kind of stuff just glanced at the movie but refused to acknowledge any deeper meaning while priding themselves as supposed authorities on what the superhero genre can and can't be. But in reality, the superhero genre, other than having superheroes, can be anything the writer and director wants as long as it is done well. Watchmen not only does it well, but does it in a way that is unforgettable."
"Alexxanderluthor","10","1","4","23 August 2012"," GREAT movie - should not be compared to the graphic novel
","That said, I'm about to make several references and comparisons to the graphic novel.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN is a film about costumed superheroes in the ""real world"". The Disney/Pixar equivalent of this is The Incredibles. You can also add Kick-Ass, Super, and Defendor to the list of films with similar concepts.<br/><br/>This film is dark, sexy, mature, violent and very well made.<br/><br/>Certain parts of the story were easier to ""get"" in the GRAPHIC NOVEL, yet other parts of the story were given more ""wow factor""(?) by being in a very well directed film. They two art forms are (obviously) not the same. I think this is basically what certain people meant when they described WATCHMEN as being ""unfilmable"" - that a director could not tell exactly the same story with film as the writer and illustrator could tell in the graphic novel.<br/><br/>This film gets a 10 out of 10 from me, not because it's the most perfect movie ever made, but because of the sheer number of things about it that are fantastic - far too many to ignore.<br/><br/>I will say this though - if this particular style of story-telling doesn't fit you, there are many scenes that will throw you off and you'll have an equal number of reasons to not like this film."
"kluseba","6","1","4","3 July 2012"," A great starts that leads to a mellow flick with many lengths
","Here comes another superhero movie after all those Supermen, Batmen, Spidermen and so on. Many movie experts simply start getting tired of all these quite similar movies and I only watched this one because somebody told me that this was a standout of its genre. The story is indeed interesting as somebody tries to murder a gang of retired superheroes that all have their dark sides in this atmospheric movie that has some film noir tendencies and a couple of solid ideas.<br/><br/>This all sounds promising but the movie is simply way too long and has many lengths. The film kicks off very well and especially the narrative parts of Rohrschach, the best character among the superheroes played by the best actor in this film with Jackie Earle Haley, is highly addicting. The movie simply develops too many flashbacks and uninspired side stories that slow down the starting dynamics after a while. Especially the typical Hollywood love story stereotypes bring what could have been a different kind of movie on a more commercial and ordinary flick for the masses. The dialogues are quite cheesy and there are too many of them. The characters are not sympathetic enough to really care about them. If they had all died, I would not have been unsatisfied. In my opinion, there is quite a waste of time and potential in this film.<br/><br/>The acting is not bad but not outstanding, the action sequences are the same and the story has its ups and downs so that the only solid thing are the special effects but they can't save this movie from mediocrity. Another letdown is the ending of the flick. I've waited for more murders, chasing scenes and the proposal of diversified possibilities to guess who's behind the crimes. In the end, there aren't so many murders and the final solution doesn't come as a big surprise and what happens in the big boom just won't come. The conclusion is not that standard and can be described as courageous as it differs from your usual happy end but I disliked the movie's philosophy and would have expected something more emotional, engaging and surprising.<br/><br/>In the end, I would only recommend this movie to those who like superhero movies and would like to see a darker side of some heroic characters. Anybody who likes Hollywood cinema and modern special effects will surely adore this movie. Anybody who's expecting something gripping, original or profound should simply avoid this kind of movie."
"champjohnson29","4","1","4","24 June 2012"," ConfusingMen?
","I've never read the graphic novel. In fact, I've never heard of Watchmen until I saw the movie trailer and learned it was a book after I saw it. To say the least, the best part of this entire movie blue penis and the alley way fight scene which took a full hour to happen. Other than that I found this movie beyond boring. I thought it was a good concept and I'm sure the book is great to have such a faithful and large following but the movie missed the mark for me.<br/><br/>It seemed like the movie was more focused on allowing to understand every single one of the heroes which is perfectly fine, but the actual plot of the movie was lost. I guess this is what happens when a filmmaker makes the movie exactly like the book was written. All of the back story is needed because when all you have are words on a piece of paper, you have make sure the reader understands and is invested. But when it comes to film, it's all visual. I felt like I was overwhelmed with information after information after information. The movie was entire too long for nothing to be happening. <br/><br/>If Dr. Manhattan is so powerful, why do these other heroes even exist? How in the world does that face mask guy have a kaleidescope on his face? How in the world are these heroes so powerful if they have no powers? It's just confusing. In a nutshell, the movie spent too much time trying to connect the audience to each and everyone of the characters with a flashback story for each of them. LOL can you say overkill. I honestly fell like Watchmen should have been a series and not a movie. Too much ground to cover for one film. The entire idea is way too abstract and big. <br/><br/>I'm a big Zack Snyder fan but this movie didn't do it for me."
"RorschachFTW","10","1","4","22 November 2011"," One Of The Best Comic Book Movie Ever Made
","You know, even through all my whining and moaning of the smallest changed details from the source material and cheeseball moments, this is about as close as an adaption comes to perfection. Unlike with Sin City, this allows itself to slightly break free from the comic panels while also being faithful to the general idea and look. Stylistically at least, Zack Snyder's direction is pretty flawless here. It takes the dialogue heavy story and makes it acceptable as a fast paced action movie worthy of the genre. By and large, the cast is well put together with only a few bad moments here and there in some of the performances. I still feel that Patrick Wilson's performance was the standout here, even above Billy Crudup and Jeffrey Dean Morgan's dean-on Comedian. Nite Owl was a character that wasn't essentially on most people's mind going in, but as he Is my 2ed favorite character from the book Rorschach Is My Favorite, it was hard for me not to get sucked in. He just plays the character so unbelievably well and, for me, represented the heart and soul of the movie. Now this will never go down as the greatest comic book movie or anything, but I feel like it has really become something of a standard in terms of what you can bring from the comic book world. In addition, I feel that the Director's Cut is the way to go. It ties up all those subplots and gives more time for characters to shine. The story is such a huge compilation of sets, characters and ideas; it's only fair that we get a full three hours to explore. The Soundtrack Is Simply Awesome My Favorite Song From This Movie Has To Be ""The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning"" By The Smashing Pumpkins That Is In The Trailer I Have To Give This Movie A 10/10 5/5 4/4 100/100 You Know What i Mean.

"raduz123","9","1","4","13 November 2011"," A truly amazing adaption a super hero film with real substance
","The Watchmen takes place in a world in which Nixon is still president and the world is verging on all out war. Within this world are a band of former super heroes who are drawn together after the death of one of their own.<br/><br/>I know two years is a little late to write a review but after watching the film again recently I felt I had too as I feel it really is a stellar adaption. The Watchmen is the deconstruction of the super hero genre with plenty of nods to some of the most popular heroes in comic culture, Nite Owl for example has some clear character references to the pre 80's Batman. What it does with these heroes is present a series of questions,mainly what would the world be like with super heroes?<br/><br/>In this world a hero who holds reverence amongst his peers is mysteriously killed. A feat so impressive that it catches the attention of Rorschach, the only hero still donning a mask and who is unequivocally uncompromising when it comes to crime and punishment. Rorschach is my favourite character from The Watchmen universe and is perfectly portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley. He plays the brutal hero to a T. In fact all performances are great. What they bring to the screen is the implications of supers in a real world. <br/><br/>It is these implications that set The Watchmen apart from almost all super hero films ironically I also feel these are also partly to blame for some of negativity towards the film especially amongst the general populace. I think people expected a film with a simple premise, some cool characters and amazing fights. The film does contain these but more time is spent on developing these characters then most superhero flicks, despite having some bad-ass martial arts skills they all posses very human feelings. This is great I couldn't help but empathise with the characters. <br/><br/>The film is presented beautifully with great cinematography and an art style that doesn't stray too far from the source material. The music is good but I feel there are some odd choices that felt a little out of place for example the Jimi Hendrix track during the snow setting. <br/><br/>I know there are many fans of the graphic novel who were displeased with some of the changes made for the movie but after reading the graphic novel I was actually left more impressed by the film, there is so much going on in the book that the film managed to fit as much as it did into two hours is amazing. Some people feel it would have made a great HBO mini series and am inclined to agree as I feel people who haven't read the book would better understand the significance of each character and their actions.<br/><br/>I prefer some of the changes the film made, the biggest and most controversial being the ending. *spoiler*<br/><br/>In the book Ozamandias knows that Dr Manhattan is the only power keeping the world from all out war and the only person who could probably stop him. Manhattan posses godlike powers like time travel and the manipulation of matter. Being the worlds smartest man Ozymandias uses the last remnants of Manhattans humanity against him persuading him to leave earth thus leaving Ozymandias able to exact his master stroke. A common foe in the form of an alien creature engineered by Ozmandias that destroys an entire city.<br/><br/>To be honest I was a little disappointed with this ending in the book. The film instead made Dr Manhattan the common foe by having him seemingly destroy half of city. This made so much more sense and after reflecting on both greatly preferred this ending. After building on the significance of Manhattan throughout both mediums it seemed as the outcome could only really hinge on him alone.<br/><br/>Well it's hard to review a film with so much substance and knowing where to stop I have already wrote a lot so to sum things up I highly recommend this film, great acting and cinematography all round and despite missing some of the great moments from the graphic novel really is one of the strongest adaptions I have ever seen.<br/><br/>9/10"
"KineticSeoul","8","1","4","1 March 2011"," Not the typical superheroes movie
","Despite some reviews that give this movie a mediocre rating, I really enjoyed this movie and kept me entertaining from beginning to end for the most part. I got very slightly bored when the movie seemed to drag a bit although just about every scene is crucial to the story. What I really liked is how Zack Snyder stayed true to the graphic novel, I mean of course he had to cut a few parts because of the length and since the graphic novel is so long and he wanted to fit in everything important into one movie. But besides that this is a very good adaptation from the graphic novel, it's almost as close as ""Sin City"". The actors in this movie is flawless, the actresses in this is alright but the actors were phenomenal in portraying the graphic novels superheroes. Especially Rorschach(Jackie Earle Haley) who is all about justic, The Comedian(Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who is a mix of just and unjust, and Nite Owl II(Patrick Wilson) sort of a boring but nerd like character or just a very stereotypical superhero but plays a big part in the plot. Like I said these guys did a phenomenal job of portraying these characters, especially after I read few pages of the graphic novel I could tell they were flawless. Some people complain about the music in this movie, but I thought it fit right in nicely especially the time period the story takes place well except one of the sex scene. What is unique about this movie is that it doesn't mainly focuses on a superhero or a group of superheroes that is going after a villain or villains, but much more than that. I never even heard of the graphic novel until I saw the trailer to this movie, but bunch of nerds were claiming the graphic novel is a masterpiece and it's brilliant. From watching this movie, I still am not sure if it's a masterpiece but it was brilliant superheroes movie. The ending however is different from the graphic novel and I could tell why Zack Snyder, would decide to change the ending to something else. And I can understand why some fans have a problem with this, since if you think about it. It just doesn't make any sense, since human nature does not work that way. I would also like to add that there are critics that make fun of Zack Snyder's use of slow motion in his movies, but the thing is not only does he use it to make the scene look more cool it's effective so there really isn't anything to complain about in that department. The story is magnificent with the superheroes having their own flaws and two them having completely different direction and there was almost no dull moment and the ""what if"" scenarios in this movie is done very well. Now this really is a must watch superheroes movie, naw scratch that this is a must watch for anyone that is into watching movies. There is a lot to digest in this movie so I suggest repeated viewing and my hat goes off to Zack Snyder for doing a great job in putting a graphic novel that most people said was impossible to be adapted into a movie into a movie. He did it and what a great job he did, must have been a difficult task. The director's cut version is also worth seeing as well, the extra minutes added some more enjoyment factor.<br/><br/>8.8/10"
"carcar-759-676336","7","1","4","7 June 2010"," I wish I could rate this higher, but...
","Now I really really enjoyed this film, but a few things pulled me back from rating it higher. The excessive gore. They have VERY EFFECTIVE action scenes, what do they need all the gore for? Do we really need to SEE some guy's arms get sawed off? Really unnecessary in my opinion. What about cheek skin getting bitten off? Way, way too much.<br/><br/>I love the character development, it was so excellent and well done. I have never read the comics, so they did a marvelous job at allowing me to understand the characters a bit more with the amount of time they had. This film was very artistic, the music score was thoroughly enjoyable and the action scenes (the non-gore ones) were excellent. The plot was effective as well. It's just the unnecessary gore that really lowered my score.<br/><br/>I don't like so much gore in my action flicks, I tend to expect that more so in horror films. I've seen less gore in some horror films than this had."
"joshkaplan2","8","1","4","5 June 2010"," Newspaper Review
","A Different Breed of Hero <br/><br/>Although casual moviegoers were probably looking forward to seeing Zach Snyder's new graphic novel adaptation for about a month or so, devotees of Alan Moore's original masterpiece have been eager to see it for far longer than that. The recent work of cinema known as Watchmen has drawn people (admittedly mostly males) from all groups of society, probably in part because of the skill with which Snyder forged his last epic, 300. What some of them don't know is that Moore is also the author behind a handful of other great movies, including V for Vendetta and From Hell. But many of the people who spent the cost of a theater ticket may have been surprised and possibly disappointed, as Watchmen is far from being a standard ""superhero"" movie.<br/><br/>The film takes place in an alternate 1980's America, where Richard Nixon is elected for a third term, and vigilantes in costumes protect citizens from the criminal element. The story, told primarily through flashbacks, revolves around several of these ""heroes,"" including the socially-inept Night Owl, the psychotic yet surprisingly winning Rorschach (played brilliantly by Jackie Earle Haley), and the luminescent, omnipotent, and nearly omniscient Dr. Manhattan (portrayed by Billy Crudup). The action is set off by a fight scene in which an aged, but still quite powerful member of the Watchmen called The Comedian is thrown out of his twentieth floor apartment window by an unidentified attacker. Rorschach, a film noir-style hard-boiled detective, spends the rest of the film investigating the crime and searching for what he believes to be a ""mask killer"" who is out to murder former heroes.<br/><br/>Unlike the more recognizable heroes of Marvel and DC, none of the Watchmen, as the team is called, seem particularly heroic in any portion of the film. Rorschach maims and kills multiple people, and the Comedian is revealed to have been both a murderer and rapist. The brilliant thing about Moore's work in the book as well as the film is that it's almost a dark satire about what kind of person would want to dress up in a costume and ""beat up the bad guys."" The viewers who ""don't get it"" are too used to the standard superhero formula: a normal person suddenly gains new powers and uses them responsibly to fight for truth, justice, and other unrealistic American ideals such as those. Watchmen, however, intentionally goes against that stereotype. Instead of flawless protectors of the peace, you get a group of crazy people in long underwear who commit many of the crimes that the public expects them to thwart. It may sound somewhat disingenuous, but the truth is that ""heroes"" are defined by what they do, not what abilities they have, as best illustrated in the character of Night Owl. Daniel Dreiberg (Nite Owl's secret identity) is irritatingly timid and romantically inept, but when he dons his mask, he becomes, at least in his mind, something more than a man, and is capable of committing great deeds for both society and his girlfriend. His companions are realistic as well, because for every shy guy who has to wear a mask to be a hero, there would be at least two or three psychopaths under similar guises. Then there's Dr. Manhattan, a true superhero who can manipulate all matter in the universe. But unlike Superman, a champion whose most prevalent weakness (other than Kryptonite of course) is that he cares about humankind, Dr. Manhattan has little interest in our race and its everyday problems. This lack of sympathy is not particularly surprising in someone with the powers of a god. Manhattan is so aloof from the rest of humanity that he doesn't even feel the need to wear clothes (if you don't want to see Billy Crudup's obviously computer-enhanced physique, close your eyes).<br/><br/>Alan Moore derived the title from the Latin phrase Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?—translation: Who watches the watchmen? The expression questions who should have the highest authority, a theme explored in this film, as you observe those who should be humanity's protectors and what they would really do with the powers they possess. So who watches the watchmen? According to the first few weeks of ticket sales, apparently 500 million Americans. Overall, the movie was very interesting, both in the way it nit together real historical events and fictional comic book heroics, and through the intelligence it carries through most of the film, including the new climax. Still, Moore makes you question the superhero genre, forcing you rethink how well the whole ""masked vigilantes"" thing would work for society, and leaves you pondering a deep philosophical conundrum about whether the ends justify the means. But even for (or maybe especially for) fans of the book, it would have to be considered ""ok"" rather than ""good."" Visually it was somewhere between 300 and Sin City, but its tone, which flits between subtle contemplation and ultra-violence, may remind you more of V for Vendetta. Unfortunately, there wasn't a really strong sense of who each of the characters were, due primarily to the absence of several essential scenes from the graphic novel, including a final conversation between Dr. Manhattan and another important hero named Ozymandias that brings some closure to story. Still, if you're interested in comics, their movie adaptations, and American culture, I certainly recommend Watchmen in the theaters. If not, save your money and watch it on TV (just not with a parent or younger sibling)."
"Xm-sellnerX","9","1","4","11 May 2010"," A great film that reminds me of Nietzsche
","I didn't read the novel, and I somehow missed out the whole movie when it started in the theaters. Today i finally watched it, expecting nothing special. The genre of the ""superheroe-movies"" really bores me, but the alternative would have been a an old CSI-episode ;).<br/><br/>I expected nice effects- nothing more. Ever since the great Song: The sound of silence, started, i realized that this movie, was kid of ""different"". It surly is edgy, and forces the viewer to ""think along"". After an hour i had to press the stop button- taking a time-out. I was stunned, confused, and delighted. How come that such a gem was hidden under the cheesy wrap of ""superheroe-movie"". In fact, 99% of all films, are a panegyric ovation of the world ""as we know it"". In any other movie, Adrians plan would have been prevented in the last second. Not in this one. The viewer has to face the situation and decide for himself, how to judge it. As you can read in lots of comments, some people are unable to cope with that situation- and seek refuge in a bad rating ;). An absolutely unjust act, but considering the state of mind of the average ""cinemagoer"", the imperfect valuation, wins watchmen just more honor. The movie is great. A feast for an educated, open mind. An upset for those who like films like Gi-Joe. Its full of metaphors, symbols and allusions. F.e.: Dr. Manhattan, the super-human, turned into a uniting enemy image, benefactor and archenemy of the human- a clear allegory to Prometheus/Lucifer. <br/><br/>Since ""Fight Club"", I haven't seen a movie, that deals, in such a great way with the question: Is an ""end of history"" (Francis Fukuyama), that the intellectuals and abstract thinkers yearn for, an appropriate goal? Or lies the meaning of life within the chaotic, eternal state of war- the diversity itself. The classic struggle between Heraklit and Parmenides. <br/><br/>While John represents, the abstract idea and universalism, Adrian is the heroic narcissist, megalomaniacal and ruthless enough to enforce what the idea just stands for. Dan is the obsolete moral of the bourgeois- unable to make a clear decision- while Rohrschach is the Anarchist, the Individualist, Nationalist, Extremist, the Chaos itself, that rejects, the abstract, global rationality. (Like Nietzsche killing ""god"") In the final scene, when his diary i found I involuntarily remembered Nietzsches poem: Unter Feinden - Among enemies.<br/><br/>""Unnütz, unnütz, mich zu hängen! Sterben? Sterben kann ich nicht!<br/><br/>Futile, futile hanging me. dying? dying? I can't die!<br/><br/>Chaos prevails!<br/><br/>A film that reminds me of Nietzsche is accepted in the inner circle of my all time favorites."

","I bought the DVD director's cut but I wasn't expecting much of a movie. I'm not into teen silly superhero movies like fantastic 4 and etc...so I really wasn't expecting much of a movie.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. It's a dark superhero movie, with a very interesting story and character development. Maybe you could say that it's Sin City meets Dark Knight.<br/><br/>A lot of people will tell you the movie sucks, but believe me that if you are not expecting your typical lame superhero story you will love it. It's a movie for people who actually want to think while watching the movie, the action scenes are brief but very well made.<br/><br/>It's very unusual for me to like this kind of movie so much but this movie it's already on my top favorites movies list.<br/><br/>If you want a powerful movie, with powerful performances, without the typical good hero catches bad hero movie, watch it and you won't be disappointed. And remember, I don't recommend for people to take children to see this movie, I've only watched the Director's Cut, so I'm not sure about the theatrical version, but the violence was pretty strong and graphic.<br/><br/>I rate it 10 / 10. I will be watching this movie several times over the years."

","The storyline presented in the movie was very deep and complex, wonderful if you're into the background psychology of people. You get some interesting ""prequel"" story lines to explain the current situation arising in the movie, which points out that even ""superheroes"" are often merely human. The one disturbing part of the movie for me was the sometimes blatant, drawn out violence in some of the scenes, including one in which one of the characters is seen repeatedly hacking another character to death with a meat cleaver. It might have been more artistically effective to ""suggest"" such violence than to so directly present it.<br/><br/>This is definitely an ""adult"" film, due to the extreme violence. I would have rated this movie as NC-17, and I definitely would NOT take anyone under the age of 18 to see this movie."
"madbandit20002000","10","1","4","1 January 2010"," It's Midnight: Do you know where your superheroes are?
","It's 1985. Richard Nixon's still President of the United States, after the country's victory in the Vietnam War. New York City's still a cesspool filled with street gangs and whores. The Cold War's brewing to an apocalyptic climax in Afghanistan. Costumed crime fighters have been banned since 1977.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's 1985, but the one's that makes up the monolithic comic book mini-series/graphic novel, ""Watchmen"", scribed and sketched by fellow Brits Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons and John Higgins. Along with ""Maus"" and ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"", ""Watchmen"" is part of the Holy Trilogy of sequential literature and has been long sought by Hollywood power brokers to be cine-adapted. After two decades of development hell, false starts and eleventh-hour legal tactics, the film version has become reality. Though not ""to the letter"", the film's still a beautiful, brilliant, self-conscious and satirical example of adult-themed fantasy, rightfully turning the typical comic book film, let alone blockbuster, upside down.<br/><br/>USA-sanctioned masked trigger Edward Blake/The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of ""Grey's Anatomy"") is violently killed in his penthouse apartment. The NYPD have no clues and are out of their league, but the misanthropic, ink-blot masked vigilante Walter Kovacs/Rorschach (an intense, Oscar-nominated Jackie Earle Haley of ""Little Children') isn't deterred.<br/><br/>His fellow compeers get intertwined: humble, polite Dan Drieberg (Patrick Wilson, also of ""Children""), the second man to be the masked hero Nite-Owl; hero-turn-corporate titan Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode of ""The Lookout"") government-sanctioned nuclear deity Dr. Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup of ""Almost Famous"") and his femme fatale concubine Laurie Juspeczyk/the second Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman of ""Heavy Petting""). The investigation, however, leads to Jon's self-exile by scandal; Adrian being nearly killed and Walter being framed for murder, leaving Dan and Laurie to find comfort with each other and ponder who's behind their neutralization while Armageddon looms.<br/><br/>Of all the cuts, the film's 215 minute cut works. Director and fan Zack Snyder (""300"", the Dawn of the Dead remake) has a ball and a half with the smart-as-a-tack script by David Hayter (the first two X-Men films) and Alex Tse (""Sucker Free City""). All three are graffiti artists with college degrees. It shows in the film's opening sequence: a collection of snapshots detailing the tale's alternative history. It's quite the trip. The societal conflicts, present in the GN, are preserved while the violence is extended, fast, brutal and consequential.<br/><br/>Working cat actors play the story's main characters, due to Mr. Snyder's plot protection against any A-lister's rep. Mr. Morgan's the embodiment of American arrogance, apathy and machismo who gets his come-uppance, despite a vaguely vocal penance to an arch-enemy. Mr. Crudup has a vox deus and the power along with it, but loses his humanity and his connection with human beings. Mr. Goode's a calculating power broker, intellectually castrating his peers, not knowing he has doomed himself.<br/><br/>The rest are my favorites for their humanity. Mr. Haley's reps humanity's ""ugly truth"", a rabid dog that got poked too many times and bites back. His sense of justice is uncompromising, yet leaves him vulnerable, alone. Like the adapted screenplay, Mr. Haley deserves an Oscar nomination, portraying an odd embodiment of fanboy immaturity.<br/><br/>As Drieberg, Mr. Wilson counters Mr. Haley with hope and fanboy maturity. He doesn't look for trouble, but the old kind, trading old war tales with his precursor/de facto guru Hollis Mason (Stephen McHattie of ""300""), a noble ex-cop turn auto mechanic/author of the masked hero memoir ""Under The Hood"". However, his demeanor's anachronistic in a world of predators, cynics and war hawks, despite his mandatory retirement. Bad enough he's sexually innocent.<br/><br/>Played with modesty yet echoes Lynda Carter, Bettie Page, and my kindergarten teacher (don't ask!), Ms. Akerman's Laurie is a perfect match for Dan. Though looking like a hippie dominatrix, Laurie resents being a ""tart"" for Jon or an object of unattainable fame, manufactured by her mom, Sally Jupiter, the first Silk Spectre (the impressive Carla Gugino of ""Frank Miller's Sin City""), a compeer of Blake and Mason's in the Golden Age troupe, the Minutemen. Laurie's anxiety exists, due to her mother's early-bird feminism, being a ""pretty gal"" who can throw a hard right. However, Blake's attempted sexual humiliation turns Sally into a bitter, booze hound matriarch from a 1980s prime time soap, bad plastic surgery and all.<br/><br/>Other cast members are fun: Matt Frewer (""The Max Headroom Show"") is a pointy-eared ex-felon, dying from cancer. Danny Woodburn (""Seinfeld"") is a locked-up midget mobster, whose vengeance towards Rorschach ends up gory and gallows funny. Bob Wisden gets Tricky Dick's arrogance and paranoia comic right as he's under aging make-up.<br/><br/>There's also the Bernies, an odd street Greek chorus made up of a cranky newsstand vendor (Jay Brazeau) and a streetwise but coy fanboy (Jesse Reid, who emotes modest black geekness), who are given more time here, due to the segmented presence of the animated ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" short. Based on the comic book Mr. Reid studies, ""Freighter"" tells the gruesome acts a marooned sea captain (Gerard Butler of ""300"") must perform to save his town and loved ones from a pirate ghost ship and its' undead crew, beautifully allegorizing with the main tale.<br/><br/>Maybe Alan Moore not wanting his name on this adaptation, after disliking past adaptations of his work, was ill-thought because Watchmen: The Film is an art house cake with blockbuster frosting. As the ""Wild Bunch of superhero films"", it deconstructs and matures the superhero archetype, gives a big hug to a medium that's been mistreated and misunderstood in its' home country, and stands a subversive fun house mirror, exposing society and questioning it. Not all of us will like it, but it exists, no matter what.<br/><br/>Like its' infamous sigil, a blood-stained ""Smiley Face"" button, the story's adage's here: ""Who Watches The Watchmen?"" Rorschach answers it during a session with a prison shrink: ""We do."" Why? We are them and vice versa."
"basrutten","9","1","4","2 October 2009"," It really grows on you
","I have to admit...it took me a while to grow to appreciate this movie. I knew next to nothing about it before I went to see it, except that it was ""a superhero movie"". I was very tired when I saw it in the cinema, semi-slept through a part of it, and the projector broke down to even further disturb my viewing. As such, I really didn't know what to think about it, except that I liked the general idea well enough to try reading the graphic novel (which is an absolute masterpiece) that it is based on.<br/><br/>Some months later I saw the director's cut, and now I can say with certainty that this is an excellent movie, both as an adaptation and on its own right.<br/><br/>The Watchmen graphic novel is extremely complex, and of course some things had to be altered and left out to even turn it into a very long movie. The good news is that, for once, that very little essential things are left out, and the alterations (i.e. the ending) are mostly for the better. It still does justice to the source material, and it works as a movie. A rare combination.<br/><br/>On its own right, Watchmen is a very dark, very dreary, but also occasionally very funny movie. Make no mistake, this is nothing like standard superhero movies, in fact it aims to deconstruct the super hero myth, by showing them as very flawed and/or outright evil, and poses interesting questions about how far people are allowed to go when taking matters into their own hand and how far one is allowed to go for ""the greater good"". Like ""The Dark Knight"", this is actually a superhero movie with depth and significance.<br/><br/>Also, this is a very violent and depressing movie, and this is one of my minor gripes. While the novel is also pretty violent, a lot of things that are implied in the novel are shown much more explicitly in the movie, which only detracts from the deeper themes and feels very gratuitous. It's not ""300 Part 2"", thank god, but it's still a bit too much.<br/><br/>Secondly, not all of the characters are that well played. While most of the actors do an OK job and while the Rorschachs character is an instant classic, there are some dud performances, most notably the Silk Spectre II (utterly clueless) and the Comedian (far too much over the top for his own good).<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" will not be for everybody. It's one of the most mature mainstream movies in years, and it goes utterly against the stereotypes we expect of action movies. It's also sports some less than stellar performances and a bit too much gratuitous violence. But it's also a beautifully shot movie full of interesting ideas and characters, and a successful adaptation of an ""unfilmable"" classic"
"spam-1606","8","1","4","28 August 2009"," An excellent adaptation marred by some exaggerated graphic violent scenes
","As a long time fan of the comic I was really looking forward to this movie adaptation and boy, did it exceed my expectations! The movie was true to the book where appropriate for film and even has a smart, new ending which suits the film a lot better.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, whenever there's a fight scene, the level of graphic violence is increased quite a lot compared to what's in the book. We're talking, arms breaking open, blood splattering and even downright, plainly visible dismemberment of limbs by grinder. This was very distracting and seemed like scenes from a splatter-movie (Saw and the like) pasted into an intelligent thriller, just for the heck of it. This mood shift was so noticeable that even my wife, who haven't read the novel, remarked on it. Given the director, one could perhaps not expect anything less but still, this doesn't add to the quality of the movie and story at all. Furthermore, the violence also detracted from the experiences of Walter Kovacs, making them seem less significant for the shaping of his character and personality.<br/><br/>Even so, this is a massive achievement and well worth watching.<br/><br/>But read the novel too ,:)"
"TxMike","Null","1","4","26 August 2009"," Super heroes in an alternate universe.
","I find that to appreciate this movie it helps to think of it as a presentation of an alternate universe, similar to, but not the same as, the one we know.<br/><br/>For example the president is Richard Nixon, in his third term in 1985. In our universe Nixon was president briefly, and resigned in shame in 1974.<br/><br/>But in this universe there are a group of superheros known collectively as ""Watchmen"" but for political reasons Nixon has banned them from duty. So part of what we see in this movie are the superheros ""in retirement."" But their desire to fight crime is still there.<br/><br/>The rather long, but never boring, movie involves a somewhat complex plot of one former superhero plotting to destroy a large part of humanity as a way to unite the USA and Russian factions against nuclear war. But most of the fun in the movie is being a part of their universe.<br/><br/>Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan is the most visually fantastic character. In an unfortunate lab accident years earlier he was transformed into this being that in bound neither by space nor time. We see him as a muscular and naked blue figure. Quite an imposing sight.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley, the skinny kid of ""Breaking Away"" fame all those years ago, is good as Rorschach. I love his line when in prison and being taunted by the others, ""You think I am in here with you, but you have it wrong. You're in here with me!"" What a menacing little guy, who wears a mask that is a Rorschach Test in constant motion.<br/><br/>My favorite is Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg, and the retired Nite Owl II, a superhero much like Batman, with a similar costume and a flying, indestructible vehicle that he hides in a cave underground. His requires some dramatic acting and he pulls it off well.<br/><br/>His girlfriend is Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter, and she is quite a figure with nothing on. They have a couple of nice scenes together.<br/><br/>Carla Gugino is one of my favorites, and here she is Sally Jupiter, Laurie's mother, and the retired Silk Spectre. Even with old makeup on, Gugino looks better in her 70s than most look in their 30s.<br/><br/>Overall a fine and entertaining movie, in a style that reminded me much of ""Sin City"", another movie with Gugino."
"melfeena","10","1","4","6 August 2009"," Easily the best movie of 2009 so far!
","There were many of comic books adaptations lately (some good, most below average) and I was expecting something of the same quality from Watchmen, boy was I wrong! It's been weeks since I've seen the movie and I'm still under impression.<br/><br/>To start I must say I don't like comic books in general. Most of them use simple plots, camp humor, unrealized sexual fantasies of the author, cheap tricks, deus ex events and half-intelligent punch lines to deliver their message (if there is any at all). But put some red ink-splash and write ""BOOM"" here and there and you get a bestseller.<br/><br/>Watchmen had none of it! <br/><br/>The plot, the depth, the sub-stories, the characters, the premise, the impact of choices, the moral questions, the setting and environment had a quality of those found in the finest literature masterpieces this world has to offer. I was especially impressed by the actual amount of the ideas you can find in this movie. Too long? I still think it was next to impossible to put all of them inside such a small period of time.<br/><br/>I realize that the plot is mostly amazing because the graphic novel itself was great (the first comic book I liked and I read it after watching the movie). But you can't doubt the talent that brought it on-screen and turned static frames into moving pictures. Visually it is outstanding, soundtrack and sound effects are simply mind-blowing. Actually any part of the movie I can think of is of the highest quality.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a great event both for your senses and for your mind alike. It is one of those few movies that deserve to be called art.<br/><br/>P.S. The ending in the movie made way more sense and I applaud for the courage it took to alter it."
"croutonsofdeath","8","1","4","29 July 2009"," A pleasant surprise, though it's flaws are quite glaring.
","I did not think Zack Snyder could pull of Watchmen. Dawn of the Dead was... OK, but nothing special. 300 was an overrated pile of crap. It should've been entitled ""Testosterone: The Movie."" Plus it's ""style"" of slowing down and speeding up time was overdone to the point you couldn't call it a style. I still queued up in line to see the film, but I went in expecting the worst. My wife and my brother were a little more enthusiastic, though they had not read the graphic novel. I came out of the theater with a pleasant feeling, I had proved myself wrong. Zack Snyder could adapt The Big Joke and he did it well. That's not to say its flawless. It has a few problems, and they are quite glaring.<br/><br/>Firstly, but without spoilers, the ending. If you haven't read the graphic novel, you won't notice the change. The change is only a little tweak, but if you've read the graphic novel, it will seem like a big tweak and it didn't seem.. fair, to say the least. It didn't fit the theme, and it caused some contradictions in the overall product.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting. While Jackie Earle Halie pulls of Rorschach brilliantly, masked and unmasked, the others are fairly mediocre. Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson are OK, but they don't seem to put much effort. The worst though falls into the hands of Billy Crudup. His acting as Dr. Manhattan is so poor that it actually ruins and changes the character in a crucial way. Rather than being the tortured soul trying to hide his emotions from humanity, he's simply an emotionless machine spouting out theories. The only bit where his character showed his true face was when he was on Mars telling the story of Jon Osterman and the creation of Dr. Manhattan, here Crudup's calm voice actually fits, and you get a small feeling of emotion from the silent puppets in the phantasmagoria of his past, all set to a moving and eerily haunting ensemble of Phillip Glass's ""Prophecies"" and ""Pruit Igoe."" Matthew Goode is rarely seen as Ozymandias, and he's like the others, he's decent but doesn't put much oomph. The rest of the cast fills out nicely though.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Zack Snyder's ""Style"" rears its ugly head once again. The man clearly has a penchant for violence and misogyny, as well as slow-motion. While he thankfully doesn't over play the Slowmo/Fastmo thing quite as much as he did in Testosterone: The Movie, he still did it at seemingly pointless places. He also liked to give rather close up shots of the violence, when Adrian Veidt's assassin takes his shots, Zack Snyder makes sure we get a drawn out segment in which, rather than focusing on the fact that there's an assassin with crappy aim in the room, he focuses on the fact that a woman gets her fingers blown off! Or how about the fat guy who gets a bullet to the head! That's more important than the assassin going after a majour character, right? It also seems that time slows whenever a female character pulls her breasts out, even a random stand in on the street slows down time just so her breasts can be on screen a little longer. The sex scene between Silk Specter and Nite Owl is also dragged on a little too long, and the worst part is other than a small funny touch, it's not erotic or interesting in any way. The actors couldn't look like they were enjoying it if they tried.<br/><br/>Despite these problems, the film plays out much like the comic book, while it doesn't have any tales from the black freighter or segments from Under the Hood, I didn't expect them too. It would be rather hard to condense those into a film. However, the style and groundwork set in the comics was faithfully recreated. The shots were done well enough that it really was like the graphic novel coming to life, and as someone familiar with the graphic novel most his life, I could spot where each issue would begin and end. The cyclic motif of the comics is carried very well, and just like the comics it is not bound by linear time. Ultimately, it plays out very well and when Zack Snyder isn't wanking slow-mo and fast-mo, the films style is pronounced and beautiful. Seeing the film on an Imax screen was quite a visual treat. This is not a complaint, I for one think that the length helped the film, but if you are an impatient viewer: Watchmen is not for you. The theatrical version clocks in at 2 hours and 46 minutes, and if you watch the ultimately superior Director's Cut on DVD, it's a sizable 3 hours. The length is probably the films best attribute in my eyes, as it allows them to tell the story properly, but I do know some people who are weary of such lengthy films.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Watchmen faithfully recreated on screen. I didn't think they could do it, but they proved me wrong. That's not to say it's perfect, but I don't think there ever can be a ""perfect"" adaptation of Watchmen. They did their best, and even my brother and wife who had yet to read the graphic novel, enjoyed it just as much, if not more, than I did. Whether you've read the graphic novel or not, Watchmen is an incredible picture. It's flaws may glare in this critics eyes, but the film makes up by being worth more than the sum of its parts. Stunning, well told, and mostly well made, Watchmen is one of the greatest films based on a Graphic novel (Not counting comic books, such as Batman. There is a difference people!) ever."
"garrettderose","8","1","4","27 July 2009"," Very WATCHable
","I've half-read the graphic novel before seeing this film. It's a worthy adaptation.<br/><br/>The music is a little silly, but I guess that just adds to the dark quirk of it all. The visuals are amazing and stylish. Rorscach was well casted, as well as my favorite character in the movie. Him and The Comedian.<br/><br/>The Comedian understood things a lot better than the rest of the team. He was a product of the evil nature of the human race. It wasn't his fault. He did some atrocious things, but in the end it really didn't mean anything. Millions of people are wiped off the face of the planet, all out of merit to the human race. Using death to assure life. Life and death is so natural, the process of how it happens doesn't matter. This becomes clear with Dr. Manhattan's change of heart, when going over the hard truth about Silk Spectre's relationship with her mother and her biological father.<br/><br/>There's a lot of eye-opening philosophical themes that float around watchmen. It's heavy in drama, and great dialog.<br/><br/>The action is BRUTAL and intense.<br/><br/>If you like the candied superhero movies of today, there's a chance you might not like watchmen. It's a very anti-hero story. There's nothing glorious about these heroes. They play out not as saviors, but mere spectators of the events in the story. ""Watchmen"" Check it out if you like something with depth."
"wlee08","6","1","4","24 July 2009"," Ultimately a boring and uneventful movie
","The first five minutes lays the foundation for an interesting plot which is not handled in any noticeable way for two hours. Things get increasingly frustrating with every flashback as the viewer is further educated on the history and motivations of all the characters. These techniques, which seem to make up more than half the movie stunt any forward momentum. The violence is over the top, unnecessarily gory. The music is some of the greatest music ever written: Dylan, Simon and Garfunkle, Leonard Cohen, etc. But it feels almost too mainstream, like it's '60's awareness time children, put down your Brittany Spears!'. Sure it's great but way too obvious. The fight scenes are typical Asian choreography, strings attached, nothing new here, the usual dancing. So, all in all, I was left feeling bored for most of the movie. There was some excellent and convincing acting in the Rorshack character, who is likable for his uncompromising views, his fearlessness, and his humour."

One thing about this director who also made 300 is that he is pretty relentless and politically incorrect which I find to be very refreshing.<br/><br/>Its maybe a touch longer than I would have liked but all in all I can't complain it was probably one of the 10 best of this year, at least thus far."

This is ultimately where Zack Snyder fails with Watchmen. He adheres to the source material so faithfully that he alienates all but the hardcore fans. He didn't have the guts to tamper with it and make it into a movie. After all, things that work in books don't always work in movies. The Harry Potter series of films are successful because they take careful consideration when making the movies, but always remembering that some things in the books will have to be tweaked if they are to be used to full effect on the big screen. Watchmen is sure to be loved by people who are already familiar with it, but for people who don't know the difference between Night Owl and Dr. Manhattan, it's a frustrating experience.<br/><br/>Of course, this doesn't mean that Snyder and his team didn't still make cuts to the story in order to shorten it into a motion picture length (still a robust two hours and 43 minutes). Many acclaimed directors (Terry Gilliam, Paul Greengrass, and Danny Aronofsky) have tried to make this movie before but ultimately gave up because they considered the source material ""unfilmable"". Many felt it would be served better as a 5 hours miniseries. It's weird to find out that Snyder and his team found a way to make it into a motion picture when other, more experience filmmakers, couldn't grasp it.<br/><br/>Instead of spending a lot of time going into story specifics, I'll just layout what I feel is important. It's 1985 and the US and USSR are still heavily going at it, with the threat of nuclear war very much on the minds of everyone. The ""Watchmen"", or superheroes, helped in World War II and have been our protector's since the 1940's. There are newer members of the Watchmen and the original members, who are still alive but very old. Superheroes have been outlawed and asked to lay down their secret identities and go back to living normal lives, but one of the original members of the group, The Comedian, is thrown through the window of his apartment and murdered by an unknown assassin. Meanwhile Rorschach, not laying down his alter ego, is living out the life as a vigilante and believes someone is trying to take out costumed heroes and feels he needs to warn his fellow members. What they don't know is that the plot is far beyond what they originally thought.<br/><br/>The cast of Watchmen is a mixed bag. Jack Earle Haley plays Rorschach well and makes the character his own, while Patrick Wilson does a solid, but somewhat bland job as Night Owl. Malin Akerman on the other hand, is pretty detached from her character and just doesn't nail the emotional moments of Silk Spectre. She's all sex appeal and little else. Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a great job as The Comedian, but his screen time is very limited and ultimately his talents are wasted. Billy Crudup plays Dr. Manhatten as detached from emotion and reality as possible, the complete opposite of the character in the graphic novel. Those are the characters that take up most of the screen time, while the rest of the cast is serviceable.<br/><br/>One thing Zack Snyder does very well in Watchmen is built spectacular set pieces and brutal action sequences. They dazzle the senses like he did with ""300"", but there aren't as many in this movie as there are in other adaptations. Watchmen is more about exposition and story than it is action, which is another reason I don't think Snyder was the right person for the job. He spends far too much time on the less interesting characters, and not enough time on the ones people will care about because of the performances (Rorschach needed fleshed out better). The pacing is very sporadic and needed some tweaking. Watchmen also isn't for people who can't handle blood, guts, and sex. The movie is very graphic (including male nudity throughout thanks to Dr. Manhattan and a prolonged sex scene that is 2 minutes long and awkward to sit through).<br/><br/>One of the aspects I think that was done very poorly was the music. It all felt out of place and just plain weird in some spots and throughout the movie several people made comments to me about how bad it was. The visual effects are top-notch though, but that is too be expected of a big budget motion picture like this. It's become something that's less an accomplishment and more obligatory in this day and age.<br/><br/>Watchmen was never boring and since it's almost 3 hours long, that's a testament to its entertainment value. The point though, is that I was frequently detached from characters and frustrated at how hard the story was to follow. This is a movie that will reward multiple viewings, but since it is 3 hours long, some won't have the patience for that. It's a disappointing, but still entertaining adaptation that would have benefited from someone that had the guts to take liberties with the story. Caveat emptor."

","It's taken me some days to decide about Watchmen. I enjoyed it far more than I'd expected, given the indifferent reviews and the vivid descriptions of graphic violence and spraying blood that a friend had given me. So I waited for the hype to die down and approached it with an open mind and an empty stomach. I haven't read the comic book (graphic novel or whatever's the current politically correct appellation.)<br/><br/>I gave Zack Snyder's last creation 300 a straight 10/10, but possibly for reasons he'd not appreciate (all that beautiful muscular male flesh) and I think as a creative force, Snyder is best described as feverish. But Watchmen is well executed, well edited, creatively made, briskly camp and occasionally witty with a few (but really not enough) one liners. It's also overly long, somewhat pretentious, occasionally daft, ever so slightly racist and very bloody. But more about the gore later.<br/><br/>It's the 1980s in a parallel universe. Nixon is into his third term having won the Vietnam War for America, the normal rules of government abandoned. A retired superhero The Comedian (who reminded me vaguely of Robert Downey Jr.) is murdered. Is it a plot to annihilate the last of the superheroes? Were they out of control? Public opinion turned against them, so they've been living quiet lives out of sight - especially the big guy, Dr Manhattan, who is a very fetching shade of blue from the top of his bald head to the bottom of his feet and all points in between. Dr M, product of a nasty lapse in lab HSE rules, is all ponderous technobabble and hands. He's lost touch with his humanity and sounds like a mating between Data from Star Trek and HAL from 2001. This is a guy who can grow in size at will; I like him. <br/><br/>Rorschach, masked Invisible Man style and asthmatically husky, investigates the death while Dr M wrestles with his inner demons. M's girlfriend Laurie - the daughter of another superheroine and played by leggy Malin Akerman - leaves him for Nite Owl II who is the Watchmen's Clark Kent. They decide to get back into the old tights (very tight in Laurie's case. Can one only be a superheroine in groin splitting leotards and a garter belt?) and start righting wrongs, while Ozymandias, the brains of the gang (bearing a striking resemblance to David Bowie) makes a fortune and may well be killing humanity to save it from itself. With me so far? Good. He lives in an Antarctic reconstruction of the Temple of Karnak with a genetically modified tiger. Dr M lives on Mars, and with poor Laurie tortured by her love for him Venus style, you don't have to be a genius to understand Snyder's agenda. But I don't have a problem with that, this is a fantasy and it's not subtle stuff. Nite Owl and Laurie get it on quite nicely and both look suitably buff and perky naked. Patrick Wilson has a nice butt. Watchmen works its way to a not unexpected conclusion in a fairly entertaining way with enough sex to keep me interested.<br/><br/>Now, that blood and gore, which ruins the camp allure. We see an axe splitting a head open, a guy getting his hands taken off by electric saw, the remains of a kidnapped female 6 year old fed to dogs, a woman's face as she's beaten up and then splayed face down over a pool table as a prelude to doggy style rape (but she must have enjoyed it, right? Apparently she went back for more later and got pregnant with Laurie. Now doesn't that bring a lump to your throat?) There's a guy getting boiling cooking oil in the face, others set on fire, beaten senseless and the usual routine shootings. All vital for that important 18 – 30 male demographic without which we are led to believe the movie industry wouldn't exist. <br/><br/>Watchmen is an R certificate in the USA. Which actually means that small kids can watch it as long as a 'guardian' is with them. I saw it 3 weeks into its run, quite late at night, which meant, thank goodness, a fairly grown up audience. My friend saw it a few days after it opened and much earlier in the day and the theatre was full of kids. Now I blame the parents when children see a totally unsuitable movie, and I don't especially blame Snyder who is out to make a buck like all corporate execs. But I'm less enamored of Warner Brothers marketing machine. They know that a movie this expensive will not return a healthy profit unless a large number of under 18s go and see it, so they market it as a Superhero movie (watch the trailers) when it's borderline horror in places. The R rating allows everyone to be totally disingenuous and say ""Well it's all down to parental supervision."" But the truth is far too many parents can't be bothered to censor what their children see, or to hire a baby sitter, so young kids sit through this stuff, munching popcorn and sodas while little girls are ripped up by dogs, women get raped and men get their hands chopped off. And we wonder why so many are dysfunctional? <br/><br/>And what is it with Snyder and the irritating narrations? We got one in 300, (in slightly off kilter Queen's English. Why? The actor's Australian. I assume the Spartans spoke some kind of ancient Greek dialect so why not just do the narration in an Australian accent and be damned? It's just as (in)accurate.) Here we have Rorschach's hoarse narration which is intensely grating after 2 hours. I am deeply suspicious of any movie which requires a voice over to explain the plot. <br/><br/>But on the whole, as a consenting adult, I actually quite enjoyed Watchmen. I'm just worried about the non consenting kids."
"wynonasbigbrownbeaver","8","1","4","26 March 2009"," My opinion swings like blue dong.
","I was first introduced to the Watchmen graphic novel when I was about 12 years old. I thought it was the coolest thing because this comic didn't hold back any punches. It had blood, nudity and profanity unlike our Marvel Superheroes of that time. I was into this novel, and I was the geek who had a closet love for Watchmen and who was also in a flock of other kids, who thought Wolverine or Spiderman was so F-in cool that they looked at me funny whenever I brought this cult classic up.<br/><br/>18 years later, as the great Watchmen novel slowly went to the back burner of my memory, I hear and anticipated the movie to be released by Zack Snyder. and I said to myself:""No way. I thought I was the only one and maybe like a dozen or so around the world who know about Watchmen."" Now everybody is on the bandwagon to anticipate Watchmen's greatness or flop. I hyped myself so much for the Watchmen to be my all time favorite. I was walking around thinking: ""Yeah, this movie is going to cure my nearsightedness and make me psychic or prophetic or something."" Well none of that came true. <br/><br/>After viewing Watchmen, I realized that what when I was young I missed out on the story and the adult situations that enveloped this classic. I think it was because I was too young and immature to comprehend its complexities at that time. This movie did me a favor by making me want to reread the graphic novel and bypass the blood, nudity, and violence in order to actually enrich my life by understanding the underlying story of Watchmen.<br/><br/>I admire Zach Snyders attempt to match his grandiose direction against Alan Moore's concept, even though it doesn't compare to the novel. Hopefully Alan Moore, can at least give Zack Snyder credit for making this attempt. The director did his best to match story and style in a live sense. And for a movie that is two and a half hours, of course it would leave a lot of that story out. His director's cut on DVD promises the movie to be over 3 hours long. Some people who hated this movie, hated it because of 3 things. 1) They were bored because it was too long, 2) they didn't understand the movie, or.....3) (the best reason)... it is no where near the greatness of the graphic novel. If they hated this movie for any other reason. Well, they don't go out much...<br/><br/>On a technical note, special effects and CGI were there and convincing. Acting was okay all around, (Even Silk Spectre and Ozymandias weren't all that bad). Sorry, I didn't go around looking for flaws in this movie. My only complaint was the multiple story lines felt a little too forced and that some characters weren't developed enough, namely Ozymandias and to a certain extent Night Owl 2. I know, I know, it would have been a three and a half hour movie if it did. And yes, the ending was rather disappointing and I thought the climax should have been more moving than just a brief explosion. <br/><br/>I didn't like this movie as much as I did 300, which had a simpler story line.<br/><br/>On a positive note, this movie left me with some nagging questions and I am willing to see this again on DVD. But I will turn back to the graphic novel before anything. I still strongly recommend it. If this movie did any thing, it reinforces the marketing of this great great novel."
"frederik_meuwissen","10","1","4","24 March 2009"," a kick in the nuts
","In my experience, the best and most rewarding films to watch are those that completely take you by surprise. I heard a lot of great things about the graphic novel but still expected to see a somewhat typical action movie with a (pretty good) story crammed in between the action scenes...<br/><br/>To my extreme satisfaction, Watchmen is another proof in a recent sequence that 'comic books' too can be enriching reading material. Behind the latex costumes of some of the least fashionable superheroes that ever appeared on screen, a sublime story unfolds, in which the characters are of the deepest gray i have ever seen in a movie. Although the context and the characters may not suggest it, the film contains some of the smartest dialogues and most overwhelming ideas i've seen since the Matrix. Apart from the evident questions a godlike character like Jon provokes (how do you use such enormous powers, what is human life worth to a godlike creature that is able to see the bigger picture,...), the sardonic content of the other dialogues raise some interesting questions too. What made Watchmen really exceptional to me (apart from the sublime characters) was the ending. Precisely at the moment where you think it's going to reach a climax in the typical, all American fight between good and bad, it kicks you right in the nuts... MUST SEE!"
"jdkraus","9","1","4","24 March 2009"," Visual Splendor+Plot=Success!
","I had never read the graphic novel by Alan Moore so I did not know what to expect. It piqued my interest, particularly being directed by Zack Snyder. I knew this movie was going to be a feast for the eyes. <br/><br/>Yes, this film has a lot of excellent visual effects, probably the best I've seen since ""Transformers"", but the grand CGI does not make this movie, but the plot. I enjoyed ""300"" for the visual splendor, but it lacked a great plot. ""Watchmen"" makes up for it. Since the graphic novel was written in the 1980s, the story revolves around the Cold War. It almost makes the statement, what would have happened if we had superheroes on our side? How would the world be? Rather, how would the Cold War turn out? For one, it takes a historical event like the Vietnam War and combines it with the advantage of the superheroes (primarily Dr. Manhattan, who helps the U.S. take over Vietnam in a week with his super powers). <br/><br/>Despite the fact that there are superheroes on the American side, the film depicts the nation as a dystopia, the masses are driven by violence, and the politicians are corrupt and power- hungry (I personally love how the movie portrays Nixon-who has been in office for 5 terms) who use the superheroes to their advantage, such as muscle work on the rioting population and the production of weapons of mass destruction to use against the Soviets. <br/><br/>But when one of the superheroes is brutally murdered, hell breaks lose and the heroes wonder who is targeting them while trying to maintain some form of stability in the world. Without giving too much more of the plot away, the movie almost holds an anti-war message. It is understandable that this wasn't released some 20 years ago (for one the visual effects issue), but also the fact that it depicts the world what it was back in such a time, as well as what it could have led up to. This film could also be considered a satire on the Cold War, the fact that it exaggerates certain things, specifically the depictions of the politicians.<br/><br/>As with the cast members, all of them added diligence to their roles. Even though Billy Crudup was probably in a green suit for the majority of the movie as Dr. Manhattan, he delivers his lines fluently. But the real genius in acting is Jackie Earle Haley. I cannot recall in seeing him in any other film, but he makes himself into the mysterious character Rorschach. If I were the academy, I would definitely consider him for a nomination in the actor in supporting role. <br/><br/>His acting though isn't the only driving force about his character, but how the director portrays him. By his clothing, with the hat and heavy coat, Rorschach is a pure superhero image of the incorruptible film noir detective. The use of the deep shadows and unique camera angles (as well as Haley's voice-over narration) adds more to the film noir genre. The only thing missing is the dramatic music. Snyder also squeezes in other genres and their elements into the particular characters in the film such as science-fiction for Dr. Manhattan, romance with Silk Spectre II, and drama with Nite Owl II. Each character also has their own unique story, which add layers to themselves as well as how they play their part in the plot, leading to the big finale. <br/><br/>The other works such as: photography, editing, sound design, costume and set decoration were all well-crafted and taken into considerable care to make such a unique film. These talents are perfectly shown during the opening titles, in which there is little dialog, shown through visuals that illustrate the events that happened from the 1940s to the 1980s, including: archive footage of the Vietnam War, and a reenactment of the J.F.K assassination. There is so much told in this opening that it is both incredible by its visual splendor but also of reminding us what had happened in the twentieth century. <br/><br/>There was one thing though that I did not anticipate in this movie, and that was its depiction of violence. It does say rated R for ""strong graphic violence"" but I only shrugged thinking that it'll be stylized and unrealistic like in ""300"". Yes, some of it is very cartoonish and even at times comical and over exaggerated, but also much of it is quite disturbing such as: a graphic rape scene, beatings and killings of innocent people (including a pregnant woman- though off screen) and other forms of brutality. <br/><br/>Such material may have been in the comic book or thrown in for shock value, but in either case, it seemed random to me, and did not benefit to the story. If anything, it seemed to distract from it. I am not a squeamish person, but some of the stuff in this film bothered me. ""Watchmen"" is a great movie, and I would see it again, but it's not for kids nor is it for those who can't handle violence. Because of this, I give this movie a solid 9/10."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>For many years, the 'Watchmen' guarded society and took care of the bad guys, until public opinion turned against them and they vanished from the public eye. Now, in 1985, former frontline member The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is found murdered and the old team start to wonder why. When an even bigger conspiracy to maybe murder more of them is unraveled, former members and some of their off-spring team together to search for the culprit before he strikes again, taking them down a deadly path where people they thought they could trust may turn out to be their deadliest enemies.<br/><br/>300 director Zack Snyder's take on the apparently (I don't think I was around when they came out!) hugely successful graphic comic books puts a subversive slant on the comic book genre. This market, almost exclusively aimed at the younger end of the cinema going population (and understandably so) is here given a lengthy, back story trouting treatment, saturated with blood splattered violence, graphic sex and strong language. The fantasy characters, with their masks, capes and costumes can't help but keep the viewer entrenched in the child like world the comic book is aimed at, and getting it such an adult rating is a risky gamble that could backfire as much as it could pay off.<br/><br/>Despite running in at nearly three hours and having little in the way of a discernible plot, Watchmen still managed the trick of never keeping me bored or looking at my watch during it. The visuals, special effects and action sequences are fantastic, and by the end you've certainly stuck with it long enough to feel thoroughly immersed in these character's histories, emotions and memoirs. But the film is following a modern trend by deviating away from the main story and taking up a lot of time digging up the history of the main characters to keep us involved in the story at hand, which only ends up serving the exact opposite, weighing the audience down with long winded mouths of dialogue that fail to flow off the tongue properly.<br/><br/>Comic book movies, even if they stretched in just over the two hour mark, used to be simple escapist entertainment which required no brain power, mainly for the under twelves who's minds were more suited to the fantasy element. Now they're all trying to be deep and meaningful, with most of the focus on back story and trying to be all clever and cynical at the same time. If they carry on like this, there's a real risk they could alienate some devoted followers who'll feel their market has been violated. ***"
"Aaron1375","8","1","4","23 March 2009"," Good movie, but certain parts of the film seemed to keep me in the dark.
","This movie was really quite enjoyable...its long runtime was a no issue for me. The main problem I had with this film is that I have never read the graphic novel that it is based on and certain parts of the film had me going ""huh, what, who?"". Do not get me wrong though, still a good movie and I got it enough that I was not totally lost or anything. The movie starts with a bang with the murder of a former superhero known as the Comedian. Well not to super as you will see through flashbacks this guy was a bit brutal, yet he also seemed to get it in ways most do not. He was the Comedian, a punchline of the American people almost a caricature of its worst. Through the story you meet others from the days of superheros as for some reason they are outlawed during the time of this world a strange 1985 parallel world where Nixon is the president still and the world is on the brink of a global nuclear war that would seemingly end most life. The only thing that seems to prevent this is one of America's strongest superheros a person who is seemingly close to being a god, Dr. Manhattan. Well he and another former superhero, Ozymandias is trying to create a limitless amount of fuel that would help rid the need for war. Well the death of the Comedian does not sit well with another superhero known as Rorschach who is a rather brutal hero in the same mold as the Punisher. He warns Nightowl, and Dr. Manhattan and his girl the Silk Specter. Through all this you know all is not as it seems and you are heading to some strange revelations at the end. Good action scenes as I loved watching the opening battle and the Rorschach prison escape...actually I loved everything about him being in prison as he was by far my favorite character cause even though he seemed the weakest of the bunch he still persevered and even though he seemed a tad off he still kept to his principles. Suffice to say I did not care for the ending to much. However, this was a very fun ride and my main complaints come from the fact this movie could have actually used a longer runtime. There was this cat that was with Ozymandias that came out of nowhere and talking to some who have read the novel was actually a lot more developed. I wanted to know why superhero vigilantes were banned as well. I have so many other stuff I wish they had developed as Ozymandias is almost a no show in the movie especially in the flashback scenes, I would have liked to see him in action as a superhero. So I liked it for the most part, I do want to read the graphic novel that I am told is a lot better than the movie."

","I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, just like I did the comic-book. Zack made a masterpiece! From the scenes, to the acting, to the action and to the visuals it was just a joy to watch. This is what cinema is all about for me. What I especially love about this movie is the eye for detail. It's simply amazing how much detail Zack (director) have put into every single scene, it's so much in fact, that at times it can actually seem distracting because you're eyes are constantly scanning the backrounds. To those who have not read the comic, I would imagine that this would actually be a bad thing, because you have to follow the storyline pretty close not to miss out on details. Well there is simply nothing bad I can say about this movie, and I've tried finding some flaws (you always do), but not even the much talked about sex scene in the owl ship was bad, funny but not bad though (how can Malin Akerman nude be bad?). Ahh heck, I just want to see this movie again!"
"zetes","8","1","4","22 March 2009"," Very good adaptation
","This might be the only movie that interested me so much with its previews that I read the book on which it was based before the movie was released. I had always heard about Watchmen, and, though not a comic book guy, I checked it out. It was good, quite good, though I balk, more than just a little, whenever anyone refers to it as great literature. That it was included in Time magazine's top 100 best novels of the 20th Century seems ludicrous to me. I found it rather sloppy overall and so in tune with its non-literary medium that I don't think it was an especially good work of literature. But I did like it. Now I've finally seen the movie. And I liked it. Very much, in fact. I thought it was a cracking adaptation of the comic book, and it moved along seamlessly. Its screenplay is surprisingly well adapted. Many of the film's flaws are inherent in the source material. There are some incredibly stupid scenes, like the sex scene and Dr. Manhattan's interview. Both are identical in the book. I might complain that the violence is a little more in focus in the movie. I wonder how well someone who hasn't read the original would understand this. The friend I saw it with said he had no problems, so maybe it's just in the details that it becomes obscure. The end of this film is far better than that of the original work, which comes out of left field and makes little sense. Actually, I did kind of like that, because it was enjoyably weird, but the film version works much better. As for the cast, I was surprised by how well Patrick Wilson played Night Owl II  I didn't think he had it in him. As everyone seems to agree, the weakest link was Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter. Akerman comes off as kind of a bimbo, at least with how she speaks, which is nothing like the book's Jupiter."

","I don't know how many ""F"" words I can put in front of ""Awesome"" to describe this movie before I get arrested or banned from IMDb, which would terrify me. Watchmen has got to be the most exciting, wonderful, and F'in awesome movie since never. Why is that? No movie I have seen has beaten this movie. I used to think the Dark Knight or War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise were the greatest movies of all time. Now, I am wrong. I am more wrong than wrong itself. I couldn't be more wrong than someone comparing this movie to the infamous Bratz movies or Barney movies with the damn egg.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most was the suspense and Dr. Manhattan. I don't even want to look at pictures of Billy Crudup, like I do with many movies I think, because after watching an intense movie and seeing pictures of smiling people at the premiere, you just know that Billy Crudup's mind isn't as complicated and complex as Dr. Manhattan. Most likely, he's a snotty jerk like most of the celebrities. But, since Watchmen was such a great movie in my opinion, I don't want to see any pictures because it would most likely ruin my perspective on this movie, and give me the impression that behind the scenes of my favorite scenes in Watchmen, people were acting like Paris Hilton or these other celebrities, and ruin my experience.<br/><br/>Well, let me continue. I enjoyed the idea of Nixon, everything seeming like it's 2009 when it was actually the 1970s or 1980s, world peace, Dr. Manhattan's complex mind, Rorschach (needed IMDb.com for the spelling of the name.. and pronunciation which is still hard), and the superheroes coming back together. As tragic as the ending sounds, I really enjoyed it. I just really felt a mix of emotions seeing my favorite character, Rorschach, who is tough and full of anger but yet, still mature and calm about everything die. I was also disappointed to see Dr. Manhattan leave the galaxy. It made me waiting for what's next to happen, even though there is nothing next.<br/><br/>I can't really explain the plot, so I apologize a little. But, you will enjoy this. The beginning may be confusing and seem like Watchmen was a sequel to another movie (unlike Pirates of the Caribbean 3 which seemed like it was a 4 and they forgot to release the third movie) but it will go great. I didn't want to see this movie in theaters with my mother because of the R rating and sexual scenes. Let me tell you something, the only penis you see is on Dr. Manhattan. There is a sex scene, but you don't see the penis. There is some breast shown. In fact, quite a lot but I haven't really seen the nipple. If you feel awkward seeing this with your son/daughter or father/mother, don't see it. If not, then go ahead."

We find out bits of the story through memories, conversations, and photos on walls.<br/><br/>The main conflict is that The Comedian, one of the former Watchmen, has been murdered. Rorschach, our narrator, is convinced that someone is targeting the Watchmen and picking them off, one by one. He sets out to discover who it is and to warn the rest of his former teammates.<br/><br/>As usual, the others either mock him or ignore him. While he is trying to solve this mystery, Dr. Manhattan gets accused of causing his former colleagues to get cancer. He chooses to separate himself from the human race and abandon Earth, which leaves the United States feeling defenseless against Russian attack.<br/><br/>The Watchmen pose a problem. They don't act or talk like superheroes, but that is the position they were given in society, at least for a time. Now, as retired superheroes, they live like a bunch of cast-off toys. The world has no use for them anymore. None of them seem happy, although a few tell themselves it's better this way.<br/><br/>The potential evil of a human soul is fully explored. We see different ones of the Watchmen cheating on spouses, murdering pregnant women, and shooting civilians as a way to calm them down. The most loathed act is done by the murdered Comedian, who tries to rape one of his fellow superhero friends. Are we supposed to like them? Is there a hero in this story at all? Or is the problem the world? In our modern world, with weapons that can cause so much destruction, is it even possible to be a hero? Do the Watchmen do horrible things because they are horrible people or because they live in a horrible world? These are the types of questions this movie presents as we watch the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is a sight to behold. The camera gives equal love to both full-screen panoramic views, such as when Dr. Manhattan sets up his own city on Mars, and the tiniest detail, such as watching a drop of blood fall and spatter the yellow smiley face pin. Yes, the action scenes include lots of slow motion shots (Director Zack Snyder is well known for this after ""300""). The tone is dark and beautiful. The soundtrack reflects the historical time periods shown, featuring artists such as Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Simon and Garfunkel, and Jimi Hendrix.<br/><br/>The acting is well done, not outstanding, with the exception of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He completely steals the show. He is our narrator, so we get to know him the best, and his character is one you won't soon forget. Whereas some of the Watchmen have gone slack or lost their passion for the work, he continues to live life with utter conviction. He never backs down, even up until the end. We might not agree with his actions, but we know what he stands for, which is more than I can say for most of the crew.<br/><br/>I would not recommend bringing children or even younger teens to this movie. It includes graphic violence, rape, sex, profanity, and disturbing images."
"Good_Will_Harding","7","1","4","16 March 2009"," ""Why should I save a world I no longer have any stake in?""
","You know you're in trouble when one of your biggest selling points is labeling Zack Snyder as a visionary.<br/><br/>Surely, quite a few people already know the basic idea behind the 'Watchmen' phenomenon, but for those who don't, allow me to fill you in quickly: It's basically a darker version of 'The Incredibles'. It takes place in 1985, and superheroes used to be all that and a bag of chips, but have since then been outlawed. For the film's opening sequence, we're treated to a beautifully choreographed fight/murder scene of The Comedian (one of the original masked heroes), whom is later shown to be quite a douche bag, which really takes away from the impact of his death. That event leads to another retired hero, Rorschrach, trying to solve his murder, which leads to him uncovering a whole other plot to destroy humanity or some crap like that. Unfortunately, the opening murder is the high point of the film.<br/><br/>You know you're in trouble when the best scene in the film is the first one.<br/><br/>The acting in this film isn't exactly 'The Dark Knight' caliber, but it's much more preferable to the inaudible shouting of '300'. The performances here are serviceable. Nothing exceptional, but the actors do their jobs well. Patrick Wilson leads the film as Nite Owl. Jackie Earle Hayley also has a major role as Rorschrach, whose face is hidden under a mask for a large portion of the film. Matthew Goode has a smaller, yet equally engaging part, portraying Ozymandias, the world's smartest man (not really sure how that makes him a superhero). We also have a glob of blue C.G.I. pixels, voiced by Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan. Last but not least, newcomer Malin Akerman plays as the obligatory female foil to the cast, although she does so with much more personality than her character was written with.<br/><br/>From what I've heard, some 'Watchmen' enthusiasts have been claiming that the graphic novels this film is based off of couldn't be done, or done well at least. As far as I'm concerned, they're yet to be proved wrong. Alan Moore, the writer of the graphic novel series, is notoriously known for not liking what Hollywood has done with any of his other works prior to 'Watchmen', and I quote: ""I'll never watch the f_cking thing"". But I can't really blame him for that, because what we have here is not what he made at all. It lacks the emotional depth, the message, or anything he intended with the graphic novel. Now, having said that, I do think 'Watchmen' works to a certain extent, as it's own film, if you don't really have any connection to the source material, or just don't associate the two with each other. Now, I've only read about half of the original graphic novel, but I'm willing to bet none of them contained an uncomfortably drawn out and oddly boring sex scene. One of the advantages of reading the graphic novel is not having to listen to ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen while the two lead actors awkwardly hump each other for two minutes.<br/><br/>You know you're in trouble when a sex scene with somebody as unbelievably hot as Malin Akerman is boring.<br/><br/>Overall, this is not the faithful adaptation the graphic novel deserves, but it's still pretty entertaining. Is this as good as the comic without comparing the two side by side? No, it's not even in the same league. But I have to commend Zack Snyder for reflecting the tonality of the source material, even though he tried to make it his own, which is where the film falls short of being a satisfying experience. It's not a must-see, but it's decent enough to at least give it a try."
"matz1036","6","1","4","16 March 2009"," If you don't know the story, it's great; if you do, it's an okay homage
","I don't think there are spoilers, but just in case, be cautious.<br/><br/>I read Watchmen 3 years ago. Great novel! I heard about the movie, got excited but also nervous. Not sure how I felt about ""300"" guy handling a not-so-violent graphic novel. My girlfriend was excited to see it. I showed her Watchmen: The Motion Comic a week before we both saw Watchmen in IMAX.<br/><br/>It's all true about weird music cues, hyper-violence, and borderline pornographic love scene. Please tell me that I'm not the only one starting to get nauseous at action/horror movies. Mr. Snyder, I loved what you did with 300, violence suits the story and borderline porno fits the feel of Frank Miller. But this is not Frank Miller. The violent scenes you added are unnecessary. The new ending was a strange choice but kinda worked, but you can tell early who the ""bad guy"" is. The first half was paced well but a lot of the second half was rushed. My favorite plot twist went from about thirty minutes to read to 2.5 minutes on screen.<br/><br/>Of course the book is better, I knew that going in. But my girlfriend and I feel this is a good homage, not an adaptation to the book.<br/><br/>She had a few choice words about it that I won't repeat. She didn't like it as much as me, I was a bit more forgiving.<br/><br/>Overall: Good: Rorschach, he looked and sounded the part, best aspect of the movie. Comedian was done very well, but deserved more screen time. The overall feel of the novel glimmers through, which I'm glad about. The ending, while altered, still seems to make the big point, and Nite Owl's reaction to the end was better than in the book (that always bugged me about Dan) Bad: Some music cues, but not all. Dr. Manhattan's high voice (didn't seem to be right). Weak acting by Carla Gugino, who usually is a good actor in my book. Hyper-violence and overly explicit sex scene (I ""liked"" it, but it took away from the seriousness of the story) Speeding up the ending.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Forgettable.<br/><br/>I give it a 7, girlfriend gives it a 6."
"EUyeshima","6","1","4","10 March 2009"," Visual Dazzle Not Enough to Elevate the Revered Graphic Novel
","I should preface my review by admitting I have never read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' 1987 graphic novel upon which this movie is based, and from my understanding, quite faithfully, at least until the end. Without such context, much less the fan-boy enthusiasm, this 2009 comic-book extravaganza is hamstrung by the limitations of conventional film-making despite a marathon 155-minute running time. The story is quite dense and multi-layered at first exposure, and while the alternate universe presented has strong entertainment value, there is less of a case for the frequent use of gratuitous violence to punctuate the nihilism of the story. Director Zack Snyder is an inspired choice to lead the character-driven mayhem given the visual invention he brought to the Battle of Thermopylae in 2007's ""300"". His sharp eye for detail is evident throughout this elaborate production, but the movie has problems with pacing and more critically, a palpable absence of soul that would have made it more directly comparable to Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"".<br/><br/>Set in an alternate-reality 1985 with Richard Nixon in his fifth term, the story has the Cold War moving into high gear with the Soviets willing to test our country's resolve with the potential of a nuclear strike. The opening credits effectively trace the semi-familiar history that brings the plot to this point with golden-era, costumed crime-fighters giving way to the next generation of superheroes in the 1970's. Snyder goes as far as recreating the Zapruder video of the Kennedy assassination with the smoking gun held by the morally bankrupt Comedian, one of the Watchmen who moved from WWII-era pop icon to reviled vigilante three decades later. Looking like the dark side of DC Comics' Justice League of America, the Watchmen had long disbanded by the time the Comedian is murdered in his apartment. This sparks at least some of the confederation to reunite albeit with trepidation. They turn out to be a motley group of psychological misfits beginning with Laurie Jupiter, a.k.a. Silk Spectre II, hesitant about wearing her latex suit again to fight for justice like her now-alcoholic mother, and Nite Owl, a fallen man reduced to impotence by retirement.<br/><br/>More interesting are Dr. Manhattan, blue-skinned and nude with the power of a god thanks to a Hulk-like paranormal lab accident; and Ozymandias, now known as Adrian Viedt, the world's smartest man and a billionaire captain of industry. However, the most intriguing Watchman is the appropriately named Rorschach, who wears a face mask with constantly shifting ink blots. A true loner in the tradition of Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"", he expresses a visceral loathing for mankind's dissoluteness that manifests itself into the film's goriest scenes. All the characters feel disconnected from humanity, and their warped perspectives drive the story. While Snyder pulls few punches in his depiction of them, the primary problem with the film is that he can't seem to pull it all together to make a dark-hearted adventure that can soar. Except for a clever use of Bob Dylan's ""The Times, They Are A-Changin'"" over the opening credits, Snyder's use of period music simply feels intrusive and out-of-sync without adding any texture to the film.<br/><br/>Much of the comic-book-level dialogue also feels stilted, and unfortunately, few in the cast seem to know how to deliver it with conviction. The best of the bunch are Billy Crudup as the eerily becalming Dr. Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley constantly seething with Eastwood-level rage as Rorschach. Jeffrey Dean Morgan registers with conviction in just a few scenes as the Comedian. However, their contributions are offset by the miscalculated performances of a too-bland Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Matthew Goode looking overly metrosexual as Ozymandia, and Malin Ackerman who plays Laurie in a petulant manner that trivializes her character's ambivalence about being a superhero. Granted there are good set-pieces like the bravura fight scene right at the beginning. Unfortunately, saddled with some surprisingly substandard CGI, the final scenes wring dramatically flat given the build-up to them, and they dampen my appetite for a sequel with the survivors. Even with all its flaws, the film boasts a visual audacity that is hard to pass up, especially if your appetite has been whetted by the novel. Clearly, Snyder has put greater priority in maintaining fidelity to the source material rather than making a movie that could resonate for the rest of us."
"wolfm72","10","1","4","10 March 2009"," Hell of a movie
","I have to salute Zack Snyder for bringing Alan Moore's graphic novel in this beautiful and gory way to the big screen. After his success with 300 I hoped that Watchmen would open to similar figures at the box office like his previous work. Unfortunately it didn't, but what can you expect from an audience, that throws over 40 Mio. $ to movies like the really WORSE Friday the 13th remake. It would be great if the Americans would go to the cinema and see some good stuff than this boring, useless and mindless remakes. I'll hope that with word of mouth the movie will life up to the expectations of the producers (especially at the box office). So guys, get up and watch a GOOD film instead of bad ones. Thanks for this epic movie Mr. Snyder and keep up your visionary work."
"jmclachlan-666","6","1","4","9 March 2009"," Went from interesting...to bland...to a raised eye brow ..to why bother? possible spoilers
","OK let me get this off the bat, I've never read the GN...i had heard about it. I knew from the get go that this movie was going to be story driven, it's just a shame the story held no interest at all for someone who isn't familiar with the GN.<br/><br/>Directed by Zack Snyder who did the enjoyable 300 has tried his hardest to out do his last film, but in my opinion has drowned in the complicated story arcs.<br/><br/>The acting isn't bad, all performance were strong for the material they had to work with. The visual flare didn't click with me, 300 looked amazing (even if after an hour it got repetitive to look at) This movie claims to be visually original, but honestly i couldn't even pick it, most scenes looked like any other drama movie.<br/><br/>There is action, but unfortunately they suffer from repetition and are nothing that has been seen before (Most of the action scenes are broken up also, consistently change back and forth between characters that really slows the pace. e.g silk spectre 2 and night owls alley way gang brawl, good fighting, decent gore but unfortunately undone by the shifting between the fight and Dr. Manhattan's press interview.<br/><br/>A lot of the character development is serverly under developed and by the end of the movie it felt like half of them had done nothing at all.<br/><br/>A lot of people will love this movie (But mostly fans of the GN), people who aren't familiar with it like myself might find it a tad confusing.<br/><br/>The movie is far too long running at almost 3hrs, and it is very stop and start story and action wise. This is successful to some degree tho as the most, Graphic comic/GN movie filmed, but unfortunately a lot will be repelled by a lot of the subject matter, which ranges from, Rape, Murder, to pedophiles, too frequent CGI nudity and sex scenes.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel Zack Snyder wasn't having much fun with this movie, and if it was a little less story and more Turn your brain off (like 300) it would be a lot more appealing.<br/><br/>To close, Not by any means the worst movie....just too target selected and not filmed to appeal to a broader audience."
"asdodge","5","1","4","9 March 2009"," Comic Book Blood & Porno fest?
","Well, a convoluted comic became a convoluted movie, with gratuitous sex and violence added.<br/><br/>Here's the plot: It is 1985 and society is very different than the 1985 many of us lived through. Richard Nixon has just been elected for his 4th term in office.... how, you may ask? Well, the USA has the one super-powered hero in the world on its side... Dr. Manhattan. After a freak accident in an atomic experiment, he is given god-like power (and gradually develops god-like notions). Although there have been costumed heroes before (The Minutemen) and a second generation (the Watchmen), none were super-powered... they were merely highly-motivated normal humans with costumes and gadgets. Anyhow... in 1971, Nixon requests that Dr. Manhattan intervene in the costly Vietnam War... after 1 week on the job, the Viet Cong surrender and the war is over. The fear of Dr. Manhattan and his power accomplish two things: (1) The USA becomes the dominant super-power... backing off China and the USSR and allowing Nixon to basically seize power for as long as he wishes, and (2) it creates a backlash of anti-hero sentiment among the population, which eventually leads to the outlawing of costume heroes (except a couple who do work for the US government secretly). Now, in 1985 again... the USSR (and the rest of the world) are sick of the iron-handed policies of Nixon and the constant threat of Dr. Manhattan's powers. The USSR begins a policy of provocation against the USA and stockpile nuclear missiles with the thought of forcing the US into an Armageddon showdown once and for all. The world is on the brink of nuclear annihilation as the Doomsday Clock ticks down to midnight (meaning nuclear war is imminent).<br/><br/>Now the background: in 1940 the first team of costumed avengers is formed, called The Minutemen... it consists of several heroes... Mothman, The Comedian, the Silk Spectre, the Night Owl, and many others. As time goes by, the Minutemen grow old and a new team, The Watchmen (which includes The Comedian and The Night Owl) is formed. Another generation goes by until a last version of The Watchmen is formed including The Comedian, Rorschach, Silk Specte II (daughter of the first), Night Owl II, Dr. Manhattan, and Ozymandias (the smartest man on earth). The Watchmen's heavy-handed style of law and vengeance, along with the fear of Dr. Manhattan's god-like powers lead to protests and outcries, until they are banned, forcing the team to go into retirement. Now, old heroes are being murdered. Rorschach has refused to retire, continuing a vigilante form of justice, and begins to investigate how and why The Comedian was murdered. He eventually contacts the other surviving members of The Watchmen who more or less aid the investigation, although they prefer to stay hidden. Ozymandias (Adrian Veidt) has become a billionaire using his brains and skills to form a multi-national corporation and seeks positive solutions to make humankind's existence better. As the threat of nuclear annihilation deepens, Dr. Manhattan (who has the ability to see the future) claims he is ""blocked"" and assumes the world will be destroyed but no longer cares. His emotional detachment- including his relationship with Silk Spectre II, and her subsequent fleeing to the arms of Night Owl II- is one of the many soap-opera subplots in the story. Eventually, as things deepen even more, the surviving Watchmen come out of retirement and help Rorschach trace the clues and unravel a plot to save the world which would kill millions. The surprise villain and the eventual decisions made by the team to avert nuclear destruction lead to Alan Moore's favorite theme- the convoluted sense of right and wrong and the gray areas of morality. Each hero is supposed to represent a different philosophical/moral school of thought from the nihilistic misanthrope Rorschach to the amoral Comedian and so on.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, four main issues prevented me from enjoying the film... 1. the hectic time pieces. Unless one knows the book, the bouncing back and forth could be really confusing to ordinary viewers. 2. The empowering of the heroes. They were not super-powered, and the movie gives them advanced strength and speed beyond human abilities. 3. The added scenes, not in the book, that change some of the themes and try to put a happier spin on some things. 4. The blatant graphic sex and violence. I am so not a prude, but this movie had too many unnecessarily graphic sex scenes and blood. A Freddy Kruger movie had less blood and gore, and the sex scenes were just too explicit. This movie easily should have been an NC-17 rating. From Dr. Manhattan constantly presenting his large blue schlong to the several sex scenes of Silk Spectres I and II with various characters (including the rape of Silk Spectre I by the Comedian). The movie was rated ""R' but the graphic sex was not in the book- just hinted- and it is, to the general public, a ""comic book movie"" and many people brought their 9-11 year-olds and left the theaters. I understand the director wanted this to be graphic and really get behind the masks of the heroes to show they all have human issues and needs (the book was a super-hero soap opera on many levels)- but it just did not need to be done so thoroughly here. We just don't need to show things. It was excessive and took away from the movie. In the end, while it tried desperately to capture the themes, edginess, and depths of Moore's story... it tried too hard and failed on several points and presented an overly-complex superhero movie that bordered on being a porn movie in many places. I am sure some fan-boys are just giggling in joy at the greatest graphic novel finally reaching the big screen and probably enjoying all the spandex sex and nudity- but, having read the novel 25 years ago the movie really did not accomplish anything positive for the book."

","The movie itself is adapted quite well.Only some scenes are changed somewhat.Some scenes are almost shot frame for frame as they appeared in the comic. My only real complaint is the music.The movie would have worked so much better with a symphonic score.Instead Snyder chooses to put pop music in that really has no relevance to the on screen story.That is,aside from the opening credit music,which kind of worked. Hopefully,Snyder makes some changes to the soundtrack when we get the epic director's cut.The movie could be improved if he does. Other than that,the movie is an interesting,well filmed piece of art.I'm definitely interested in seeing the extra footage.And will be waiting patiently for the director's cut.

","I went into this movie unbiased, as I have read and heard many mixed opinions. Prior to attending the film I started reading the first few chapters of the graphic novel. I'm glad I did not finish it before watching the movie.<br/><br/>The parts I read were frame by frame the same as the graphic novel, which left that part of the movie spoiled. But after getting past these parts; it was amazing. The movie was beautifully shot. The plot had me thinking about the natural destructive behavior that all humans instinctively have. The ending in the movie was perfect, it brought morality into play as Ozymandias chose the lesser of two evils. Ozymandias' decision brings light to the fact that all decisions are not black and white but varying shades of gray; there is not one absolute right answer. I loved the ending because it worked very well, and was more understandable than a giant squid; portraying Dr. Manhattan in a role that resembles a Cold War Jesus of Nazareth, sacrificing his self image for the greater cause. Snyder's interpretation of Watchmen is a masterpiece which achieved bringing fans and the average movie goer together on a dark journey through one of the most celebrated graphic novels of all times. Oh one more thing that I found surprisingly ironic and intriguing was the fact that the movie is also a parody of itself portraying sex scenes while the character Rorschach disproves of such behavior.<br/><br/>I give Zack Snyder's Watchmen 10/10 stars, a must see, but keep in mind the movie is almost three hours long, and not for the sufferers of low IQ and zealot evangelicals."
"uhchilly","5","1","4","8 March 2009"," Alan Moore was right...
","One way reading (books or graphic novels) differ from movies is that they don't rely on motion. Continuous motion. With books you can digest the words and pictures and absorb their meaning at a pace that permits you to develop your own understanding at your OWN pace. Its how really complicated stories get told very well. Watchmen as a graphic novel is second to none and both in its original monthly format and in its compiled form, lets you go back, re-read, examine the art, embrace the connections and the meaning. Movies can achieve a similar feeling but because they are slave to time (unlike Dr. Manhattan) the information is ALWAYS coming at you, never giving you any time to really appreciate the gravity of any particular scene. I have to agree with the folk who couldn't stand it, even though I think it was very well made, sadly it fails completely in providing the gravitas that the graphic novel does because its creators fail to realize that you cannot just translate these things shot for shot. It just doesn't work. Neither does this movie. (and the violence was just pointless and groan inducing, way too much and it totally detracted from the high-brow story.) Bleh."
"michaelblum","10","1","4","8 March 2009"," Terrible movie...
","... for your average movie-goer. It's got 'splosions, guns, sex, bewbies, punch'n and kick'n. But it also asks the viewer to reconsider the hero archetypes that they've been ""learning"" for years. This may be too much to ask of the unwashed masses who desperately need their characters to be carbon copies of simple types they've seen in every other movie, doing the same things and participating in the same stories they've been told thousands of times. And so they may find themselves challenged when they go to see this ""superhero"" movie. They may lash out angrily to their lack of comprehension of what they see. They will be distracted by blue genitalia and a plot that actually dares to stray from the stock Hollywood formulas. But if you read at least one book a year and you have highschool level reading comprehension, there is a chance you might like this film. The other 70% of America should steer clear of this movie."

One of these things is Dr. Manhatten just smiling at his girl and just like that they are in love, another thing to mention are of course the stunning visuals and fighting scenes. they are quite reminiscent of the movie ""300"" what is no coincidence as you all probably know ;).

"macey37","10","1","4","8 March 2009"," ""I Watch The Watchmen""
","One word to define is this film is incredible. I read the graphic novel of Watchmen and let me tell you this is just as good as the graphic novel. In 2008 we received the Dark Knight one of the greatest comic book movies ever made and this year we have received ""Watchmen.<br/><br/>When I first heard about Watchmen was now officially coming out in theaters I was excited. When the cast was announced I was shocked. I thought that A-list actors were going to be cast instead they're was C-list actors but the whole cast was phenomenal. Jackie Earle Haley was awesome as Rorshach, the way how he talked with the raspy voice, his every movement was great. For the small part he played Jeffrey Dean Morgan was good as The Comedian. Malin Akerman was great as Silk Spectre II, good acting and she was very hot. Patrick Wilson was a perfect choice for the Nite Owl II, how his every emotional feeling was spilled out in the movie. Billy Cudrup was awesome as Dr. Manhattan for how the character can tell time and for what the future awaits. Matthew Goode was amazing as Ozymandias how he is a gentleman but intense as anything in certain scenes.<br/><br/>Zack Synder was the perfect choice to direct this film. After the success of 300, why not Synder to direct this masterpiece. How he made the scenes from the graphic novel in to life. How he made the action scenes were incredible.<br/><br/>There was only one difference from the novel was the ending, there is no giant alien in this one. The ending in this one made more sense in my eyes. Other than that the classic graphic novel is finally brought to life. I recommend to go see this film. 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Macey37 P.S. I watch the Watchmen!"
"fosterino","5","1","4","8 March 2009"," Unsurprisingly Incomplete
","Let me start off by saying that I HAVE read the novel. I'm not one of those people who went to go so see it because 300 was ""awesome"" and it has super heroes in it.<br/><br/>That said, this is one of those movies that was destined to be somewhat incomplete. There really is no way that any film adaptation could have possibly included all the elements from the novel, like Tales of the Black Freighter and Under the Hood, for example, but there were just too many omissions and glaring inaccuracies for the film to capture any of the novel's genius.<br/><br/>WIthout spoiling anything, I feel like I have to list at least some of the stuff from the novel that I liked the most that was, for whatever reason, not included in the movie. Along with the aforementioned ""Tales"" and ""Under the Hood,"" there is no back-story of the Minutemen. the previous generation of heroes (which includes Sally Jupiter and the Comedian), none of the converging subplots revolving the newsstand guy, the comic book kid, the detectives, the psychiatrist and his wife, no Laurie back-story, no Ozymandias back-story, etc., etc. I suppose the film works as a direct adaptation of the Watchmen story, as in the events between the Comedian's murder and the cataclysm in New York (which is changed in this version). However, the novel's strength, in my mind, is the way it supplements the story of the costumed heroes of the present events with all the events and characters that surround and preceded them. <br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me but probably won't bother anyone else, is the degree to which the movie is so ""popcorn-ified."" The novel didn't really have much fighting. There was violence, but not huge brawls. The movie has the same over stylized fighting from 300, sometimes using totally random slow motion that does nothing but look really stupid. There are a number of fights/battles that are either fabricated or embellished to the extreme, with 4 marauding thugs turning into dozens, presumably to satisfy brain-dead moviegoers who expect a high body count. The level of violence for violence's sake at times reaches fetishistic levels. I just didn't enjoy watching it all that much.<br/><br/>For all its faults, though, the most prominent in the film HAS to be the soundtrack. With the exception of the awesome opening credits sequence, this has to be the most bizarre and inappropriate collection of songs in a film I have ever seen/heard. Not only that, but the way the film is edited to the music is really jarring and abrupt, either for effect or because of time considerations. For example, during one of the climactic scenes between Dr. Manhattan and Laurie, probably one of the only scenes to work well in my opinion, the moment lingers for about 1 second before a smash cut to Dan and Rorschach in Antarctica, flying along to Jimi Hendrix. This one moment irked me most, but the same sort of stuff happened through out the whole movie.<br/><br/>I hate to be so negative, but I have to say that the acting was mostly pretty bad, the worst being Malin Ackerman. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach is really fantastic though. When you see him without his mask, you see his face, and you see that he twitches and seethes with anger. It's kind of hard to buy BIlly Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, probably because he is computer generated, and I couldn't get over his kind of insubstantial voice. I always imagined Dr. Manhattan as having a deep, booming voice more in line with his ethereal presence. Whatever.<br/><br/>One of the things that I found most puzzling, not necessarily in a negative way, was how the film ignores some of the most obvious and effective visual cues from the novel. I would have to spoil stuff to explain a lot of them, and I don't want to do that, but if you read the novel you would probably also see that some of the most dramatic and iconic images and panels don't make it into the film.<br/><br/>Like I said, there was probably no way any filmmaker could include everything in a movie version of Watchmen and keep it under 5 hours. It probably wasn't as bad as my long list of its perceived problems and inadequacies might suggest, but its not really that great either. I feel like it was made for people who haven't read the book to understand, and that's not me, so I can't support it wholeheartedly."

","Maybe it was low expectations, but I thoroughly enjoyed ""Watchmen"". It ranked up there with the first Matrix movie.<br/><br/>Even though I have become jaded with movies of the action genre (I was not a great fan of the Batman movies, nor the Superman movies, except the first one), Watchmen was well done, great action scenes, and some plausible people. It was a good ""alternate universe"" (genre) of movie. <br/><br/>So, if you have not seen the movie yet: please go see it without reading about it, and be prepared to follow a complicated story line. <br/><br/>And, yes, if you have NOT seen the movie yet, please rate this a good review that was helpful to you, and then see the movie, but don't read the rest of this review. Okay?<br/><br/>**Spoilers below** <br/><br/>I was surprised and glad that they had male nudity: somewhat a first for such a series. I guess part of it was the opposite of gratuitous violence: most action movies throw in violence, and most US movies do not show nudes, even when it is appropriate. And like the ""Southland Tales"" movie, sometimes low expectations and surprises can make you appreciate something even more. <br/><br/>The movie, by the way, is a bit too long, but you know, it's worth it. There's a lot of good stuff in the movie, and the irony and plot twists are great. <br/><br/>Some things are a little strange: the dumbness of some of the characters, their incredible skills, and some great technology. Examples of that are: 1) female super-hero pushing buttons without thinking 2) one character's weird Chinese style way of speaking (dropping the word ""is"" and articles ""a"" and ""the"") -- but that fits in with the original comic book 3) their ability to fight -- although a bit more realistic than Kung Fu movies 4) Gee, I want to list some of the technology, but I feel I can't without ruining the movie for those who haven't seen it. 5)Rorschach's totally appropriate name.<br/><br/>I read the comic book, and it was okay, but not great. The movie (for whatever reason) is great. Maybe I took too long and couldn't follow the comic, but I could follow the movie, with its twists and turns."
"reneemarie2000","9","1","4","8 March 2009"," Watchmen looks deep inside us, and sees darkness
","Perspective of a 20-something female that's never read the Watchmen (or any other) graphic novel: <br/><br/>My conclusion at the end of watching Snyder's ""300"" was that it was a movie made for men. It was full of violence, ""manly"" displays of strength and strategy, and was an artist's visual portrayal of an historic event with little supporting storyline or depth of character. In contrast, Snyder's ""Watchmen"" had a much deeper storyline. By keeping the runtime at almost 3 hours, the filmmakers were able to tell a story without reducing it to just a series of violent encounters.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, the movie was violent. Violent, twisted, and dark. However, the fight scenes and graphic grotesqueries were supplemented by a somewhat-complex story about humanity at its darkest, and the conflicted ""heroes"" that are supposed to ""save"" us.<br/><br/>The characters' personalities and back-stories were well-developed, and real moments in history were modified to create an altered reality centered around the cold war. The characters were all both ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", each contributing both positively and negatively to the outcome.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" is no typical superhero story, and paints a grim portrait of human nature. It is a very adult movie, and I felt bad for parents that brought young children along. Not only because of the graphic scenes, but also because many of the historical references would resonate better with older adults. Some people in the theater were laughing at inopportune times, I suppose because the movie would make a less-introspective viewer uncomfortable. It also contains quite a bit of nudity, and seems to aim to portray a ""raw"" vision of human beings.<br/><br/>The acting was good enough, and the action was great (I dislike pictures that show such ""close-up"" dark fight scenes where you can't even distinguish who is hitting who - this wasn't like that). Similar special-effects techniques to those used in ""300"" were used in ""Watchmen"", though in a modern urban setting, which gave it a different ""feel"". The music was great and supplemented the storyline well, and offered selections from a variety of genres, from Jimi Hendrix to Simon & Garfunkel to Wagner.<br/><br/>Because it seemed people leaving the theater hadn't just seen what they expected to see, I think the current 8.5 IMDb rating will drop lower as more people weigh in. Don't go see it if you're expecting a comic book superhero story like ""Spiderman"". I can't say that the movie was ""enjoyable"" - in the sense that it is a bleak portrayal of our worst characteristics and is therefore difficult to watch, but on the other hand, I couldn't look away. I will say that it is a very well-made and unique movie, and worth seeing for its masterfully dark storytelling and departure from the stereotypical ""hero"" character."
"NeilCreates","9","1","4","8 March 2009"," Everyone watches the Watchmen
","They said it couldn't be done - turning Alan Moore's graphic novel into a film. I can see why. The source material is rich and visually overwhelming. But they were wrong. The film produces on more than one level.<br/><br/>We open with the ageing Comedian (Morgan) in his place. Suddenly the door is smashed down and the style is set. Instantly we see Zack Snyder's stamp on the film, with trademark slow down then speed up action and brutality. In a short but powerful confrontation, The Comedian is killed. Obviously we sympathise with the brutally murdered hero, but in a series of flashbacks we begin to realise he is all not all he appeared. The effect of this is that you don't know what to think. Should I feel sad about this? Should I be glad that bastard's dead? It's a great trick that echoes throughout the film - are the Watchmen good guys or bad guys? The answer - they're human.....well.....apart from the big naked blue guy.<br/><br/>Speaking of - in this alternate decade, the world's first superhero has been discovered - Dr. Manhattan (Crudup) and he is essentially a god. With the world under threat of nuclear attack from Soviet Russia, Dr. Manhattan is America's best defence (and weapon). Crudup doesn't have much chance to display great acting talent, but what he does is fine.<br/><br/>The real great acting comes from Haley - anti-hero Rorschach and Patrick Wilson - Nite Owl II. To say Haley is covered in a mask for 90% of the film, an incredible amount of emotion is revealed, even when smashing a butcher's knife into someone's skull. And when he is de-masked about half way through, you instantly believe that the weak-looking man is the hard-as-nails vigilante. Wilson provides a fair bit of light comedic relief but also delivers great emotional moments. He's really a character we can relate to.<br/><br/>But for me the Oscar goes to Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Maybe I'm biased because I loved him in SUPERNATURAL, but he's on top form. He does a great job of portraying the Comedian as a bad ass, gun totting warrior with no care for human life. And just when you think you've got him figured out, he starts crying! An excellent performance and I have no doubt that Morgan's phone will be ringing non stop over the next few years.<br/><br/>The script is ambitious to say the least. I'm unsure as to how much is from the original comic (I suspect most of it), but nevertheless, it's a grand story. I was never bored. Probably because I had no idea what was going to happen next. This was done mainly by the fact that we're in an alternate timeline. Anything can happen (including President Nixon's nose growing larger!) Direction-wise, Snyder has done what's expected - created a visual masterpiece. Tense action, grand landscapes, CGI camera work - it's all there. In 300 (Snyder's other big film, if you've been asleep), this got a little repetitive, but here I was thrilled throughout. None of the sheer brutal action (and believe me - there's some majorly brutal violence) is unjustified. Knees shatter, bones crunch, elbows burst through flesh - you name it, it's there. All justified, all amazingly realistic.<br/><br/>Dialogue-wise, it's smart, witty and insightful. With talk of saving humanity from themselves by killing them and corruption of the system, it's very political. The best line of the movie however, comes from Rorschach (straight from the comic) - ""All the whores and politicians will look up and shout 'save us'. And I'll whisper...'no'"" All in all, WATCHMEN is the most ambitious comic book adaptation to date and it delivers on all levels. If I had one problem with the film, it's that bloody tiger! I'm assuming it's from the novel and you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie (which you have to do). There's no reason for that tiger to be there. Fortunately, it's only on screen for about a minute.<br/><br/>It's a must-see for comic book fans and 'normal' folk alike. If you thought THE DARK KNIGHT was a good, powerful movie, you ain't seen nothing yet! Also see if you enjoy looking at a giant blue penis."

Watchmen is a cinematic wonder from start to finish, and it is a must see for viewers raised in the 50's and 60's, like me! There is so much going on that it begs to be seen more than once, but it's far from confusing. In fact, it's just the opposite; it really makes you think. When I left the theater, I pondered what Superman would have done were he in the movie. It's not your average superhero scenario by a long shot! These supernatural beings have true hurts, true fears and extreme emotions that will thrill you and stimulate (or embarrass, depending on your morals) your senses!

","Just went to the Watchmen tonight and I feel spent after watching it. Very intense and dark movie, much darker than I expected. Standout actor in the movie was Jackie Earl Haley. It's just amazing to me that prior to Little Children in 2006 he hadn't made a movie in 13 years. So sad to think of all the great roles he could have played during those years. If you need someone to play a tortured soul, this is the guy to call. The rest of the casts acquits themselves well, but overall it is the stylistic vision, special effects, action, and overall quality of the cinematic experience that make this film special. Highly recommended."

","The best thing i can say about this movie is that having watched it yesterday i woke up this morning, pondering on it, thinking about the scenes, the meaning, the message and the performances. And man some of them were just incredible. Top of the list Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach - he left me shuddering, not just with the mask off, but with the mask on. Much like the masked Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta, the ability to completely capture a believable character using nuance of movement and voice staggered me. When the mask came off and the man beneath was revealed i shuddered, not least at the apex of the movie when he faced of against Dr Manhattan. I'm not kicking Heath Ledger when he's down but if he's set a precedent then Mr Haley should be due a statuette next Feb. Alas, you suspect it'll only happen if he perishes before then. Jeffrey Dean Morgan also deserves a big up - balancing an open, understandable humanity with some of the most despicable behaviour imaginable was no mean feat and was pulled off with aplomb. The dense, flash-back heavy story telling, especially those segments narrated by Manhattan with his uncaring, deadpan VO, added layer upon layer to this film. You're seeing the present as he does, another example of the past, a part of continuum. This is a deep, emotional, intelligent, challenging masked-hero movie that goes further than any other in it's depth and scope. I'm not guaranteeing you'll enjoy it, but at the very least you'll be left with thoughts and images that demand attention."
"JoeB131","10","1","4","7 March 2009"," An incredibly loyal adaptation
","When watching a film based on a popular book or graphic novel, there is always the expectation of how closely the producers will follow the source material. Too closely, it might not be accessible to non-fans. Not closely enough, and the loyal fans will crowd onto websites like this one and scream bloody murder.<br/><br/>The producers decided (rightfully) to stick close to the original except for one minor plot alteration at the end (which I will discuss later.) They were very loyal to the characters and their motivations, probably only leaving things out if there wasn't time to work them in (and I suspect that many of them will be in future director cuts or special features on the DVD.) This is a long movie. 162 minutes. Factor in previews, you are going to have about three hours.<br/><br/>If I have any quibble, it is that some of the violence and sex was even more over the top than Moore and Gibbon's original work. The heroes don't just beat up criminals, they kill them. (Only Rorschach did in the original novel). Even Dr. Manhatten's nudity is less subtle than the comic book. This thing has and deserves an ""R"" rating, so don't be fooled into bringing your kids because this is a comic book movie, you'll be answering a lot of questions afterwards you'd probably would have wanted to put off.<br/><br/>Now, for the plot alteration... Don't read any further if you don't want to be spoiled. Okay, here you go. In the comic, Ozymandias creates a fake crisis to bring the superpowers together by fabricating fake aliens and simulating an interdimensional invasion that forces them to work together. (Mind you, this was in the 1980's, before we discovered Reagan was ""right"".) The change here is that Ozymandias simulates a fake Dr. Manhatten attack on cities around the world, making him the common enemy. I don't think it worked quite as well.<br/><br/>Other than that, first rate acting, first rate direction, first rate CGI (not overused like some movies) etc. I can't wait for the DVD to come out!"

The fighting scenes were absolutely awesome. A lot of blood and gore. There are a couple of dirty scenes and a lot of references to pornography. Almost all of the characters fit perfectly to their roles. All except for Billy Crudup (Doctor Manhattan/Jon Osterman). His voice is very different then what you would expect Doctor Manhattan. All in all, it was one of the best book to movie adaptions I have ever seen in a movie ever. Go see it now."
"omahonyjason","8","1","4","7 March 2009"," WATCHMEN Delivers Dark Justice
","WATCHMEN, Director: Zack Snyder, Country: USA, Year: 2009, Language: English, Runtime: 163 Minutes, Rating: 18<br/><br/>What we got here is a Superhero movie that's closer in tone and content to TAXI DRIVER (1976) than it is to Spiderman, Superman or Batman. It's a dark, brooding, complex, multi-layered mystery adventure set in an alternate 1985, one in which Nixon is back for a third term as President and costumed superheroes are part and parcel of everyday life. The cold war rages and threatens to turn hot. The world is ticking dangerously close to nuclear war. Midnight on the 'Doomsday Clock', which charts the tension between the US and the USSR, signifies Armageddon and the clock reads five minutes to midnight.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN is based on the comic book of the same name which was originally published by DC Comics as a 12-comic book series between 1986 and 1987. The 12 parts were subsequently collected into a trade paperback, and quickly became something of a critical smash. It's the only 'graphic novel' to win the prestigious Hugo Award or, indeed, to be named among Time Magazine's '100 Best English Language Novels.'<br/><br/>The original Watchmen, however, is near un-filmable, such is its density. So the director, Zack Snyder, who made the wonderful 300 (2006) deserves a lot of credit for making a movie that's damn near as cracking as the comic. Few directors could get away with making a $130 million R rated comic book movie, without any stars, but that is exactly what Snyder achieves. And the film is all the better for it. <br/><br/>The plot centers on Rorshach's investigation of the murder of one of his former colleagues. Along the way he uncovers a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. During the course of his investigations, he reconnects with his former crime-fighting pals  a rag-tag group of retired superheroes , only one of whom has true powers, the near-God-like, John Manhattan  and glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future.<br/><br/>The film is fantastic, Snyder delivers in spades and the little-known actors are a revelation. Particularly Jackie Earle Haley as the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorsharch. His Noir voice-over is reminiscent of Bickle's in TAXI DRIVER, with words dripping from the screen like scratched treacle. ""The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout 'Save us!' And I'll whisper 'no'.""<br/><br/>Classic!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","4","7 March 2009"," ""Unfilmable""? Snyder proves otherwise, at least with amazing visuals
","Finally, the greatest and most ""unfilmable"" graphic novel of all time reaches the big screen. I can understand director Zak Snyder's hesitation in taking on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' ""Watchmen"": it's a golden example of a story that perfectly fits its medium, that doesn't need to be told (and maybe shouldn't) any other way. But Snyder takes the challenge head on, opting to stay as visually and structurally faithful to the novel as possible, crossing his fingers that the rest will work out. And ""Watchmen""'s crowning achievement ends up how stunning and marvelous it is to watch. As for the rest working out, a bit of something is left to be desired--part of the impact of the characters and their struggles lost--but all flaws of the film directly correlate to the choice to stay true to the source. A tough choice, but the right one for this movie because the visual payoff is extraordinary.<br/><br/>The first challenge the film meets with incredible success is setting up the context for an alternative 1980s America where Nixon is in his fifth term dealing with the Cold War, Armageddon is looming and self-proclaimed vigilante superheroes walk the streets to try and do good (although they've been recently outlawed). The opening credits sequence does this masterfully. It is without a doubt the best opening credits sequence I have ever seen. Not only is it loaded with goodies for ""Watchmen"" fans but it drops information needed to understand the film and shows how famous historical events or iconic images and the like would have been altered if the ""Watchmen"" universe were reality. All this in the form of still or slow-moving images. I wanted to stand up and applaud when it was over.<br/><br/>The middle of the movie is the toughest part to endure in terms of pacing and understanding the characters. There's a lot to digest as we dive into the mysterious death of retired superhero The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and what it means to the ruthless vigilante Rorschach (Jackie Earl Haley) trying to solve it. Add the vital back story of the other characters: all-powerful Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the lonely Dan Dreiberg once known as Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), the lost but beautiful Laurie Jupiter once Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman), her mother (Carla Gugino), and the powerful businessman who commodified his once superhero-dom, Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), and you have just way too many characters to follow. Naturally, that means you take to the coolest ones (Rorschach) and find yourself wanting to know more, which the film could never do without either boring you or taking away from the story.<br/><br/>With so much character development going on, things can get slow, so there is action added to the film at parts or intensified by Snyder at others as only the ""300"" director would know how. Snyder amps up the violence a bit for this reason (and likely a bit for his personal tastes). In general, the sympathy I developed for all these characters reading the graphic novel isn't there as much in the film because too much is going on at one time. This is where doing a straight adaptation gets extremely difficult, because handling all this at once in a film is near impossible unless drastic changes are made. For the most part, the acting of these reputable but not A-list stars helps you get to the core of these characters more than you might otherwise.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the main idea of the story which creates an incredible two-view perspective on human nature comes across clearly in the end as the world nears its darkest hour, and you leave more satisfied than you thought you would through parts of the film's second hour.<br/><br/>But understandably, the dark, psychological aspect of film is not what will drive most people to see it. Snyder brings it to this film in terms of action. When you watch these heavy-hitting, physically exaggerated fight scenes, you recognize they're far from real, but gosh are they cool. In combination with great sound editing, Snyder's tendency toward slow motion is exciting and captivating. But what he deserves more credit for is the way this movie is shot scene by scene. It is sweeping and grandiose at times, intimate and tense at others, beautifully lit and colored by his cinematography team at every scene. Best of all, there are so many small details from pictures on the wall to other things you won't catch the first time if you don't know the novel that really do enhance meaning and comprehension. Honestly, his only poor choice is Leonard Cohen's ""Halleluyah"" for the soundtrack during the soft-core porn scene. Not having this film scored was a risky proposition. Having actual songs from the era help create a sense of realism, that this is a period film, but it does hurt the emotions at times.<br/><br/>Truth be told, no one else could do a better job than Snyder. He's the real deal, I truly believe it after seeing the incredible vision he brings to the project. Maybe others could do just as good a job or worse, but not better, because this film is very firmly an adaptation: a chance to see source material beautifully and cleverly re-created for the big screen. Nothing can help the fact that this story cannot be fully understood and appreciated as a 163-minute epic, but instead requires a slower digestion afforded by the novel. Without butchering the source material, there is no way to make ""Watchmen"" a perfect film, so Snyder and writers take the high road, aiming to please fans and terrifically execute every scene as if to say the parts are more valuable than their sum. Although a risky move as far as films go, it's the right one for such a treasured story."
"jooleigha","8","1","4","6 March 2009"," Amazing, but...
","The Watchmen was one of those movies that could easily have been terrible. It could have been butchered by a poorly written script, editing, graphics; so many things could have gone wrong. And they didn't. In the end, it is perfectly true to the novel in themes and overall meaning, and is thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>But when one of the ideas conveyed is that the human race is too cruel, is it wise to insert so much violence? It seems as though parts of the movie were made to cater to teenage boys rather than anything else. Obviously a lot of the violence is necessary, I'm not suggesting that there should have been less action sequences (especially since it is an action movie). But time and time again we are shown unnecessary (and not always very realistic) imagery; limbs sawed off, slow motion stabbings, body parts snapping.<br/><br/>Why? <br/><br/>The Watchmen was amazing in some aspects because it was a cut above the average action film. There were so many ""Deep"" themes that very few movies in this genre even touch on. For instance, one predominant idea is that humans are naturally corrupt, that they can be disgusting and crude (the comedian...). It then seems ironic that the actual movie appealed to our violent, depraved side by adding in touches of graphic violence solely for entertainment. That it seemed necessary to add this in speaks for the human race in itself.<br/><br/>But then again, I'm just squeamish. If you've no problem with gore - or the fact that the use of it goes directly against the movie - then you should be fine. It is still an enjoyable movie, but as the philosophical aspect melts away, we are left with only an action film. Enjoyable, but not a classic."
"Mash-the-stampede","10","1","4","6 March 2009"," I watched The Watchmen : )
","Having recently purchased and read the graphic novel of 'Watchmen' - by Alan Moore and after the realisation of what a fine piece of literature 'Watchmen' is, naturally I became as excited as a school girl for the release of this film which has been dubbed ""un-filmable"" by many due to the complex nature and story layout of the novel. Not to mention the films trailers were awesome! Still, as excited as I was I had to go into this film with lowered expectations as no matter how good the film could be - it couldn't ever be as good as it's source material, right? Well, first and foremost the graphic novel and the film should NOT be compared as they are both two completely different forms of entertainment media. Blatantly, you can't make a film exactly the same page for page as what is essentually a comic book for adults! Plus the film's running time is 160 minutes which is long for most people so obviously it does not go into as great detail as the graphic novel. Some scene's have been altered and/or shortened and some scenes have been taken out all together but to be honest, if Zack Snyder tried putting in every last detail from the novel - the film would be closer to six hours long!!! Besides all that, the film is still an excellent interpretation of the graphic novel and very simply put...is absolutely brilliant!<br/><br/>Now it was obvious from the film's trailers that the visual effects were going to be impressive (and they are) but still, what really makes Watchmen brilliant besides the great cinematography are the actors who really go the extra mile to bring these characters to life and give them depth and complexity not found in other films of this sort. The casting was perfect and every actor matched their comic counterpart flawlessly most notably 'Jackie Earl Haley' as the tough-as-nails (and slightly mad) vigilante ""Rorschach"", who is also the films narrator. He was perfect for the role and literally became 'Rorschach' both physically and mentally and really succeeded in bringing the character out from the pages and onto the silver screen. The whole cast's dedication to their roles was phenomenal and besides the fact that they dress-up in skin-tight spandex suits and fight crime, are really identifiable and relatable as everyday human beings. Although this film is fantasy, there is still an overwhelming sense of realism to it which really enhances the overall experience. I was absorbed right from the spectacular opening scene right up until the final curtain and the 160 minutes flew by.<br/><br/>I do recommend reading the graphic novel before seeing this film although it's not essential that you do but that being said, this is not your average ""x-men"" type ""super hero"" flick: it's dark, graphic, extremely violent with frequent explicit language and full frontal nudity! In other words, it's ""R""-rated for a reason!!! So if you don't like violence/brutality, long films or films with complex characters and plot - you might want to skip this one as it really isn't for everyone. You either get it or you don't... but if you're like me and you love this kind of stuff (or just appreciate descent films that are a little different)....then don't miss this film as it really is a truly wonderful theatrical experience and a master piece of it's genre.<br/><br/>Now for the die-hard fans of the source material, there are several scenes and plot details missing (obviously the comic within a comic ""tales of the Black Freiter"") yet funny enough there is an added scene (I won't go into detail) which is more implied in the novel than actually portrayed (or might be done in one panel at best), put to the song ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen which is a pleasant surprise. Now every time I hear that song I can't help but chuckle! The scene is beautiful though, Hallelujah indeed ;) This film has definitely raised the bar for comic book/graphic novel adaptions to come and will be extremely hard if not impossible to beat. And if you want to go as far as dubbing this a ""Super-hero"" film, then it's definitely the best one you'll ever see!"

","'Watchmen' is set in 1985, in a alternative reality where USA and Soviet are on the brink of nuclear-war. Superheroes are outcasts, and vigilante Walter Kovacs alias Rorschach, is investigating the murder of his former colleague Edward Blake alias the Comedian. As he digs deeper into the case, a mysterious plot unravels - now he reconnects with members of his former legion, and starts uncovering a disturbing conspiracy.<br/><br/>I was a 'Watchmen' virgin watching this at the cinema. Having heard so much of the enormous popularity (I still believe it was mostly among geeks) of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, I understood that I (and surprisingly a huge percent of my fellow Norwegian movie-lovers) had missed out on one of many of-its-times cult-literature-works. The novel was supposedly ""unfilmable"" as directors as Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass had failed to capture its essence, but director Zack Snyder ('300') did certainly not let anything stand in his way when shooting one of the most ambitious superhero-tales ever written. Snyder lets it all hang out in this, but he's certainly torn between two camps; the ones who know and love the novel, and people like me, Watchmen-virgins.<br/><br/>The film tells multiple stories, and tries capturing every emotional, political, and moral complexity in bits and pieces throughout. The six superheroes are interesting and compelling characters; Jackie Earl Haley is Walter Kovacs aka Rorschach, a masked vigilante with a dark past, whose ""do-it-or-drop-it"" encouragement makes him an unstoppable force of righteousness; Patrick Wilson plays Daniel aka Nite Owl II, a man fearing his former alias and who's hiding away his past in the basement, unable and failing to blend into society; Malin Akerman is Laurie Juspeczyk aka Silk Spectre II, a leathery chicksa whose counter-responding to her mother's superhero-days and are conflicted in a difficult relationship with Doctor Jon Osterman aka Doctor Manhattan, played by Billy Crudup, a doctor who accidentally became empowered with otherworldly powers and are awing bleakly at humanity; Matthew Goode plays Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias, the only former 'Watchmen' who has revealed his identity is a ageless Aryan who's now operating as a global business-man; and there's Edward Blake aka The Comedian, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, a psychopath whose humor has a brooding darkness and purpose. All of this characters have a dark edge, and at times they almost look too-hot-to-handle, and with already such layered philosophical dialogs and deepened mythology it comes a bit cooking when Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II develops an affair that becomes dominating in the second part that appears neither natural, sparkling or vivid, it just becomes a bit annoying. And here Snyder fails to capture the humanity and humorous sexual tension between guys and dolls clothed in spandex, and neither all of the actors achieves to completely fulfill their characters soul (Matthew Goode, Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson). But this is undoubtedly a gang-of-six full of spectacle and rousing aspects; for example Doctor Manhattan is a sort of anti-superhero, the cirupy piece of glowing CGI works splendidly when alone on Mars trying to seek for a higher ground, and his relationship-troubles with Laurie / Silk S, feels interesting in the film's humanization of the vigilantes; and Rorschach is truly a paranoid superhero-version of Philip Marlowe, wearing the classic coat-and-hat but with a mask full of ever-changing expressions, strolling down the rainy streets with a snarling voice including a under-used narrative, he's tracing down a murder mystery with brilliant determination.<br/><br/>Snyder makes it run for 2 hours and 40 minutes, and although I'm sure there's plenty of further details to investigate at a second viewing (for the geeks), it feels a bit long when there's really no climax to appear, and now there's things to love and hate about exactly that - but it surely could have been chopped down, because there's nothing to love about a film feeling like it's never going to end. But herein the long running time there are blasting visuals, the loads of green screen and digital effects are all over the place, but Snyder manages to create a world and vision that's got dark elements of film-noir, science fiction and Armageddon. In Snyder's previous film '300', he kept the story at 1st-grade levels, spoon-feeding the audience with ridiculous voice-overs and one dimensional characters, here he goes the opposite way around. Its bloody seriousness and anti-mainstream heart is way-interesting, but as said I feel it was a novel of its time, and so much of its references and ""oh-so-intelligent"" gibberish becomes, well gibberish, and the storytelling becomes a bit disorderly when the plot starts knotting up, and we're given quirky humor of various success and pop-cultural placings of great music that doesn't necessarily become executed greatly; Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" playing under that nostalgic intro is great, the use of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" while Nite Owl and Silk Spectre makes love in a daft craft on the other hand, is simply terrible. <br/><br/>In the finale there's a lot that doesn't entirely make sense, but still, there's the bone-crushing violence and grim characters that makes for a interesting watch, and it's full of glowing ambition, and so 'Watchmen' succeeds to make a change in the path of superhero-movies."

"BlackAndWhiteChris","7","1","4","5 March 2009"," Character study, but not action-packed
","It's a cliché, but: the book was better. Even with a length of 160 minutes, the movie is just too short to explain the whole story. The result is a movie that confuses you a lot.<br/><br/>And there's a lot of story: the movie takes place in an alternate 1985, where masked loonies walk the streets, beating up evildoers, but are now outlawed, so they've retired. America won Vietnam, Nixon is still in the White House and the Cold War is about the get hot, with America and Russia both keen to start WWIII. Luckily America has Dr.Manhattan, who keeps the Russians calm. The story focuses on a few superheroes, and this is where it shines: the characters are never one-dimensional but always very complex in its character studies. These heroes all have their problems.<br/><br/>While most of the actors are not well known, they are all very good, with the exception of Matthew Goode (Adrian Veidt) who didn't convince me (he seems a little too young). Billy Crudup stands out, it's a difficult job playing this godlike character who shows almost no emotion.<br/><br/>I'd say the movie has a slight marketing problem: the trailer makes it look like an other action-packed superhero movie, which will disappoint some people. It starts off as a whodunit, but it soon focuses in on the characters, leaving the plot hanging until the end.<br/><br/>So did I like it? Weeeeeeeell, yes. Having read the book some times, I'm a little annoyed by things that have been left out, changed, etc. but it was certainly not a bad movie. Not even a mediocre one. They even had the balls (pun intended) to show Dr.Manhattan in all his naked glory, which I didn't expect. I applaud the fact that we can now have a Hollywood blockbuster that for once isn't afraid to show you male nudity. We all know what it looks like, so what's the problem? What I didn't like is the morphing effect on Rorschachs mask, which is kinda nice, but illogical since he is just a man.<br/><br/>My last advice: don't go see this for the action, but for its interesting characters. And if you liked it, check out the comic book."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","5","31 March 2015"," A Groundbreaking Achievement Of Its Genre
","A gorgeous blend of art & entertainment that's accomplished on both technical & narrative scale, Watchmen is one of the greatest adaptations of a graphic novel on the silver screen for it not only manages to translate the feel, texture, tone & essence of its source material on the film canvas in its absolute form but is also the most thematically rich of all the films that have surfaced in the superhero genre of cinema, so far.<br/><br/>Set around the mid-1980s in an alternate reality in which superheroes came into existence, America won the Vietnam War & the nuclear tension between United States n Soviet Union is at an all-time high, the story of Watchmen concerns a group of mostly retired American superheroes who, while investigating the recent murder of one of their colleagues, uncover a far more sinister plan which they try to stop before it is implemented.<br/><br/>Directed by Zack Snyder, Watchmen is his most accomplished work to date for he's able to bring on screen what was considered un-filmable by many & unlike 300, he succeeds in doing so without going for the green-screen unless left with no choice. Using the existing comic book as storyboards, Snyder is able to retain the texture & tone of the novel which when blended with his very own trademarks, turns Watchmen into something that feels truly unique to its genre.<br/><br/>Screenplay is deftly written, characters have a well-defined arc and the various themes & pop-culture references it deals with are expertly handled. Production design team provides an otherworldly setting to the film with its intricately designed sets, Cinematography makes near-perfect use of colour palettes & lighting plus the lavish use of slow-motion actually fits its narrative. Editing paces the plot steadily throughout its 186 minutes of runtime & the way its incorporated songs exhibit a contrasting effect to accompanying scenes is sheer genius.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Watchmen features a very unconventional cast in Patrick Wilson, Malin Åkerman, Jackie Earle Haley, Matthew Goode, Billy Crudup & Jeffrey Dean Morgan and all of them deliver damn good performances although it's Haley who ends up stealing the show as the masked vigilante Rorschach as every scene involving him is a treat to watch. Yet my favourite moment is the segment showing us the origin of Dr. Manhattan for the way it is arranged, scored, executed & presented is no short of perfection.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Watchmen is an immensely rich, unflinchingly bold & unquestionably unique take on superheroes and in more ways than one, is a groundbreaking achievement of its genre. With a lack of any star in its ensemble cast, a complex & allegorical plot that unravels more on multiple viewings and its extremely grim & depressing tone, it is destined to polarise its viewers & garner a devoted cult following but just like any great work that was quite ahead of its time, this masterpiece will one day have the respect it truly deserves. Strongly recommended."
"Bruce722","6","1","5","11 September 2012"," Loses the impact of the book...
","This was a very disappointing book-to-film portrayal. Not only do they include the only stupid element from the book (Jon's ability to see into the future which I fully expected them to keep) but they also changed some things for the worst. For one, unlike in the book where there is some foreshadowing but the twist is still somewhat of a surprise, this movie gives away the identity of the villain pretty much from the beginning. Also, they give the characters superhuman abilities for some reason that, other than one minor glitch in the end of the book never actually existed. Rorschach can't leap 10 feet into the air at will, Adrian Veidt isn't a superhero, etc. This not only turned a dark and realistic world silly but it also made the closing sequence of the film incredibly retarded. And speaking of Veidt, this was by far the worst casting of all of the characters. In the book, Adrian Veidt appeared to be a ""larger than life"" person, not just in terms of his celebrity and persona but also in terms of his physical appearance. The dude was a big, strong, and intimidating person but Matthew Goode looks like a dorky little twerp. Malin Akerman also wasn't a great selection but she at least pulled of the role of Laurie Jupiter decent enough. The rest of the casting was fantastic and they nailed the style of the book spot on. The soundtrack was also really good. Honestly, other than the Adrian character in general, they really stayed very true to the book. It's just that this story is so reliant, not on action and effects but rather on the development of the characters and the world itself. And while they developed the world really nicely, I think they failed to develop Dr. Manhattan enough and his back story is really one of the key turns in the book. Overall I think they gave it a solid effort but it just doesn't have the same impact. I think people who read the book will at least find this movie at least intriguing and somewhat enjoyable but I think people who never read the book will find the movie mediocre at best."
"MovieProductions","5","1","5","22 March 2011"," ""Watchmen"" is interesting, but never involving
","** out of (****)<br/><br/>""Watchmen"", written by Alan Moore, is an iconic graphic novel which conveys a politically significant message, but taken in such a highly stylistic, but never artificial direction. How does the film compare? Well considering Snyder's lackluster, and simply moronic ""300"", there isn't too much good to be found. The Good News: It's a notch about ""300"". The Bad: It's still never involving. With a bloated running time, and a few substandard performers, ""Watchmen"" doesn't live up to its hype. <br/><br/>There's no denying that this film has the best cinematography I've seen to date. The CGI is just simply mind-blowing, and all the set designs are plastered, and saturated in its finest texture. Snyder is a very visual presenter. That's fun and all, but what's behind the pretty picture? The answer is nothing. Malin Akerman's performance was one of the most irritable, and hard to watch. She's very stale, and has a lack of enthusiasm as each scene progresses. How anyone can find her a great actress in this film is beyond me. Furthermore, the film's pace is very incoherent. Some scenes run longer than others, and other scenes run shorter than others.<br/><br/>Also, the slow-mo got distracting. We don't need slow-mo in every action sequence. I must confess though that this was a pretty unique experience. The script wasn't too bad, the visual style was breathtaking, and the film always kept me thinking. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Watchmen"" is a film that's designed to earn cult status, and maybe it will, but it certainly isn't a good film. Snyder needs to mature as a director. He's too concerned finding the newest trick in the book without concentrating on what's most important. The movie. ""Watchmen"" is interesting, but never involving."

"krisfox420","10","1","5","13 March 2010"," Watch these Men
","Movies based on books usually suck. But Zack Snyder has pulled off what many people have considered impossible in bringing Watchmen to the big screen. Changes almost always have to be made in order to fit the story to the medium. Most of time, the changes ruin the source material. But Watchmen maybe an exception to the precedent set by earlier movies based on comic books. The changes made for the movie make it easier for non-comic fans to appreciate. <br/><br/>The story of Watchmen is about a group of costumed vigilantes who are trying to save the world from nuclear annihilation. None of them have super powers except for Dr. Manhattan who is played by Billy Crudup. There are a slew of people in this movie and all of them are tremendous. There is The Comedian played by Jeff Morgan who is killed in the first scene and his murder is what begins the mystery that needs to be solved. Rorschach played by Jackie Earle Haley starts off the investigation into who killed The Comedian. He concludes that someone is killing off ""masks"" and he goes to tell his former teammates of his findings. They include Dr. Manhattan, Silk Spectre played by Malin Akerman, and Night Owl played by Patrick Wilson. I don't to spoil the movie, but it plays out much like a classic detective noir. <br/><br/>Even though this is a superhero movie, it's not all about mindless action. It examines several thought provoking subjects. Such as human nature, good and evil, and what motivates people to act the way they do. Because it focuses on these universal subjects, it can be enjoyed by lots of different people. Much the way The Dark Knight was. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder used the graphic novel as the storyboard for his movie. Many of the scenes are taken directly from the book. Everything from the colors, lighting, camera angles, and even dialogue is faithful to the source material. This is a good thing because the creators of the comic took a great deal of time in creating a cohesive world. <br/><br/>One aspect from the book that wasn't included in the theatrical release was the story within story called The Black Freighter. The Black Freighter is a comic book that a kid reads throughout the story. It is about a victim of pirates and his descent into madness while seeking revenge. The story parallels the main story. The director did film these sequences though and they were edited back into the movie for an ultimate cut that was released on Blu-ray. Their inclusion creates a mini movie within a movie, and for fans of the comic it is much appreciated. <br/><br/>Watchmen may perhaps be one of the best comic to movie adaptations ever. It is very faithful to the book concerning its look and feeling. Though some things were changed. They were all done for the betterment of the film. The changes help the movie appeal to a more mainstream audience, and if people enjoy the movie enough to read the comic book, then it can only help to show them that comics are not just for kids. I can't recommend this movie enough for anyone who might be interested to see it."

","Watchmen is the Bible of comic books. Every true comic book nerd keeps a copy by their bedside and every night they worship the author/God, Alan Moore (Who incidentally looks exactly like one would picture a comic book God to look like.). The book itself is original, deep, smart, provocative, action-packed and in short amazing. That being said, how does the movie compare? To keep the religious analogy going it's not the Holy Grail of comic book movies, that title still lies with the Dark Knight. Watchmen however is a strong second (Consider it a really-really-nice grail even if it's not holy.).<br/><br/>Why the movie is so good probably has a lot to do with the fact that very little is changed from the actual comic book. Almost all of the dialogue is identical, and most of the scenes are extremely faithful to the comic. A major thing that was altered was the ending even though only minimally and in my opinion for the better. Also one of the best lines in the book, ""Nothing ever ends,"" is said as an afterthought in the movie and not by the intimidating blue dude like in the book, but that's nit-picking.<br/><br/>Where the movie doesn't work is the acting, which varies from amazing to painful. Rorschach, the Comedian and Sally Jupiter fall into the amazing category; Laurie Jupiter and Ozymandias sadly do not. Laurie Jupiter looks good in her part but the acting seems forced and her lines cheesy. Ozymandias could not seem like a more stereotypical cold and heartless villain right from the beginning which is not good because it's supposed to be a surprise that he is the stereotypical cold and heartless villain.<br/><br/>Back to the plus side, Zach Snyder the director does an awesome job. The montage to ""The Times they are a Changing"" is one of the best parts of the movie and just overall his style works with the film. Like all really good directors however he doesn't know how to keep a movie short (Peter Jackson anyone?) and Watchmen is over two and a half hours.<br/><br/>That pretty much sums it up. If you have ever read a comic book you have probably already seen the movie  multiple times. If you somehow fall into the above category but have not seen it, I would make it a top priority. As for you others out there who have never read a comic and haven't seen the movie, I would go see it and consider it kind of like watching one of those foreign films with subtitles. You won't really understand anything that happens but you'll appreciate your glimpse into a different and alien culture.<br/><br/>The Question should not be "" Who watches the watchmen"" but "" Who doesn't watch the watchmen"" Like the review check out more at Sabretoothmovies.blogspot.com"

The comics has been adapted almost page-to-page (with the exception of the ""Black Freighter"" comics-within-comics, and a few cosmetic changes such as the visual appearance of the near-end catastrophes), and those responsible for the visual side of this movie have made a perfect job -- costumes, devices, rooms, prison cells, streets -- it all looks almost exactly as in the comics. In this regard, the movie follows in the footsteps of SinCity with its ""frame-to-frame"" conversion, without looking ridiculous.<br/><br/>The choice of relatively unknown actors who will not try to steal the show for themselves was also a lucky one: They seemed to me to play as a team, rather than stars.<br/><br/>With over 3 hours of screen time, the movie didn't bore me for a single second, and that's quite an achievement, considering I knew the story from the comics.<br/><br/>This is a must see for all comics fans."

I obviously can't agree wholeheartedly, but it is clear that the movie was possible, it was great and it was as dark as they come.<br/><br/>The title hints on what the story is about: who watches the watchmen?, them being not a bunch of goodie-goodie moral archetypes, but as human as they can possibly get: cruel, damaged, afraid, all powerful, etc. What can... no, what will they do with all that power, in a world that, convinced it no longer needs them, is heading for almost certain nuclear holocaust?<br/><br/>I am keeping this movie and highly recommend it to anyone.

This is the interesting scenario of ""Watchmen"", not only a comic-movie, but a comprehensive reflection on America. To make a movie from the graphic novel ""Watchmen"" is almost impossible. Zack Snider tried, the result is not bad, but not perfect either. Moore, one of the two novelists, boycotted this project. While the plot is developed as a thriller (who want to kill the Watchmen?), the focus shift from one character to an other, each of them reflecting a different philosophy. This is the strength of the movie, but also its foe. In a novel, the authors had all the time and space to develop all their philosophical questions. Which are: when the use of brute force is legitimate? Is man entirely responsible of his actions? Does God exist? If God exists, why he ignores sufferance and considers the complete annihilation of humanity? Is life really a ""miracle""? Is peace a value in itself? Does it justify sacrifices and millions of deaths? In a movie is impossible to reach an answer in 160 minutes. When we leave the theater, we can think: ""it's too much"". And we had no answer as well. The (not so much) happy ending is a great delusion, especially if we compare it to the open ending of the novel. But I don't want to make any spoiler. But there are other strengths in this film: it's fantastically politically uncorrect! And it brakes all the clichés of superhero movies: the Watchmen are not entirely good, they protect society by means of violence, sometimes brutal violence. In superhero movies, usually there no gore and no sex at all. Here we can taste ultra-violence and a lot of sex scenes. Usually in a superhero movie, political debates are off-limits. In Watchmen, politic is the main focus. And we can taste satire against liberals and peace-mongers (and vegetarians) never heard in other commercial movies. This is an act of courage in the era of politically correctness."
"Charlzincharge13","Null","1","5","31 March 2009"," Review: Watchmen is Excellent, Just Uneven
","For a film as ambitious and complex as Zach Snyder's visionary Watchmen, it would be a crime to brand the movie's legacy with a single letter grade or numerical score. Watchmen is above rigid classifications. And while film critics are pioneered watchmen (it is their job, after all to watch films), the most valued watchmen are theater-goers willing to risk $10.75 to satisfy their desire for escapist entertainment. What makes Watchmen so challenging is that it is not easy-watching.<br/><br/>While most comic-book flicks these days are purely geared towards escapism, Watchmen compels viewers to consider humanity in its lowest form and think about the human capacity for evil. Snyder brilliantly depicts a world drained of hope in an opening montage of revisionist history meant to challenge viewers to acknowledge the explosion of evil in recent decades. Rather than focusing the introduction on just a character, Snyder sets up the the film's underlying tension of nuclear war by illustrating the increasingly evil nature of humanity over the course of many years.<br/><br/>That Snyder was able to capture the essence of human futility by uniquely demonstrating the accumulation of this hopelessness over countless years is a unique vision which deserves praise. And the feel of Watchmen at points can be frighteningly committed to the nihilistic atmosphere Snyder sets up. Snyder's Watchmen in this respect is far more convincing than The Dark Knight in its portrayal of a noir-like dystopia.<br/><br/>While Snyder's 300 was visually enthralling, it felt like the kind of disposable entertainment which you can chew up and then spit out. Watchmen, on the other hand, lingers in your mind like a bad spell. The film is more than just visual dessert. It is a philosophical challenge to all viewers to side with their own protagonist. While all (or most the Watchmen, depending on your opinion) can be considered protagonists, they all represent opposing views on the value of human life. As the entire world holds its breath, the Watchmen simply wait, too conflicted and wary to take action. These Watchmen are no ordinary heroes. They are deeply flawed, complex, and extremely well-developed.<br/><br/>As the script's storyline is really only a couple hours long, the film inter-cuts each individual of the Watchmen's past history to their present-day apprehension with the world on the brink of nuclear war. What makes this technique so effective is that unlike the average cinema superhero, the Watchmen are anything but super. What they really are are just washed-up retirees who have a little taste of nostalgia for who they used to be. And it isn't until this nuclear debacle that they found out who they really are.<br/><br/>The only major criticism worth noting is the film's editing. Forget about ""Who Watches the Watchmen?"" Who watches the final cut? Watchmen's soundtrack is just all over the place. It likens to the product of what happens when a teenager and his friends make a home video on their very first video-editing program and add their favorite songs to layer the soundtrack. Individual songs in Watchmen's soundtrack are great, but the combination of these songs polishes this film with an unnecessary Hollywood glaze. Perhaps the editors and Snyder weren't quite on the same page.<br/><br/>But Watchmen should be remembered for what makes it great instead. Granted, it is difficult to purely appreciate the film when it is incredibly uneven. With regard to the performances, for instance, some actors were really on (Jackie Earle Haley) while others were detrimental to the viewing experience (Malin Akerman). Certain parts in Watchmen are incredible while other parts are bound to just tick you off. And that's a damned shame for a movie with so many touches of greatness."
"jruby","8","1","5","27 March 2009"," The Bomb Has Been Dropped!
","Yes! It has finally happened! The proverbial bomb has been dropped!<br/><br/>It has been dropped right into theaters on the bright yellow screen. In many respects I agree that such a misunderstood power should have never been utilized. However when something of this magnitude, the most celebrated piece of literature with pictures is stored in the arsenal. It isn't a matter of, if it will be used, but rather when and by who?<br/><br/>It should come as no surprise then that it was America doing the proverbial bomb dropping. Many thought it was a decision better suited for the Brits, such the over imaginative Terry Gilliam (Brazil) or the grit ""shaky"" realism of Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Ultimatum) or maybe even Batman re-inventor Christopher Nolan. But in the end it fell into the hands of an American. And who better to release this monstrous adaptation than a director who is well known for his dedication as a fan to the very genre.<br/><br/>I am speaking of Zack Snyder (300) who, along with Cinematographer Larry Fong has created a visual masterpiece. From the fluid camera movement to the set design, the characters, colors, and overall atmospheres, of which seem to be lifted right from the pages of the graphic novel. Watchmen is a film that immerses audiences so deep they either drown or become acclimated to the strange and dark world presented. This movie, visually, is with out doubt diamond cutting direction and is near flawless. It is an achievement only realized now as Watchmen is a production almost two decades in the making.<br/><br/>The movie presents its audience with an alternate illusory 1985 New York in which masked vigilantes are no longer seen in comic books but instead are on the streets fighting crime. The graphic novel much like the movie portrays a kind of wit parody to its own breed on the surface. However underneath this alluring parody is a multifaceted story heavy with material, flashbacks, character development, plot twists, psychology, physiology, theology, and any other kind of ""logy"" you can think of. Both the graphic novel and the movie are unlike and unwilling to be like the average superhero crime fighter. Instead the material explores the concepts of right and wrong, what the limits are and at what cost.<br/><br/>Some of the character threads are spread a little thin in Snyder's Watchmen. The script by David Hayter and Alex Tse clearly tried to hit all main background points for the plot and characters. However it just wasn't enough and came down to the actor and actress's performance. The strongest performances coming from Billy Crudup (Big Fish, Almost Famous) playing the clockwork God figure, Dr. Manhattan. As well as Jackie Earl Haley (Little Children) growling his way through the film as the psychotic crime fighter Rorschach. A man who sees the world both literally and metaphorically in black and white through a makeshift mask made to look like an inkblot test. ""So tell me doctor*puts on mask*what do you see?"" While most of the performances were on point there where a few that felt overacted as if they had been acting in a soap. Many times I felt this inconsistency of performance distracting which removed me from this marvelous world that had been constructed.<br/><br/>The music like some of the acting had me raising my eyebrow and smirking more than once throughout. With such a bizarre selection of tracks including 99 Luftballons and such obvious tracks such as The Sound of Silence for the funeral scene and Ride of the Valkyries for the Vietnam scene, this comes off as almost an insult to the intelligence of it's audience. First, to the music that I think did work. Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin' was a perfect selection and placement to an introduction montage that is worth the ticket price alone. I know that some may disagree but I also thought Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, was also a great selection and placement for Nite Owl II's ""coming out of retirement"" scene. In addition Philip Glass's Pruit Igoe & Prophecies was magnificent as the backing for Dr. Manhattan's exile to mars. As for the other music that didn't work as well, I understand that the director had to fit in tracks like Unforgettable and All Along the Watchtower because of its reference within the graphic novel. However this is exactly how it feels at the end of the day, forced and misplaced. It was as if in the editing room they were struggling to think of how and where to put specific tracks. (SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Now on to the ending, as most people who have read the graphic novel know, It was not Dr. Manhattan, or his power, or in anyway his involvement with Veit that caused the cataclysmic explosion. They will all tell you it was a giant alien that looks like a squid that did it. No matter how much I would liked to have seen that, I must admit Snyder's version of the ending works better. When I read this in the graphic novel I felt that it was an unnecessary and bizarre, although very cool, additional element. It however isn't even the giant squid that I had problems with at the end of the graphic novel. It was the fact that Dan and Laurie leave to get intimate while there buddy Rorschach they just sprang from jail is about to become a bloody inkblot in the snow (Nice extra touch by the way). This was completely in opposition to the character development that had been drawn between Dan and Rorschach and I believe the film has in a way fixed an otherwise careless ending.<br/><br/>Bottom of the Line: <br/><br/>+ Remarkable Visuals, Very Close to the Source Material, Some Great Acting Performances, Fixed Ending.<br/><br/><ul><li>Some Not So Good Acting Performances, Music Selection and Placement off Putting, A Few Unnecessary Changes.</li></ul><br/><br/>Grade: B- <br/><br/>http://www.cinema1337.blogspot.com/"

","I want to open this comment with this personal quote: ""The Dark Knight has broken my comfort, my definition of Hollywood, my consideration about the blockbusters""... but i heard (march, 2008): ""The most awarded graphic novel adaptation to the big screen is in post production... "" I'm confused, there is a 'most awarded graphic novel'? Yes, there is. The masterpiece was called ""Watchmen"", for first time in my life i have the resources and the enthusiasm to discover the inspiration, the seed of a big budget screenplay. I BUY ALL the numbers of the series -from a friend in economic difficulties, ha- and read, read, feeling all that situations, living that world in those stretch suits, WATCHING the predicted Armageddon. In all the forms that can one WATCH, not only read, WATCH. There is when my general appreciation ends -saying so much- and begins my valoration of this film. If my vote accomplished 3 stars is only for the (arguedly) respect of the original treatment (a few fulfilled characters, overall drama), but there is a particularly ridiculous management of the casting, customs and direction. The characters are condemned to a flamboyant apparency into a most bizarre society. I can't put in words the other odd feelings of that almost twisted visit to the cinema. A big, a God Damn Biggie, detail is the Soundtrack. Jesus, in my whole life i was exposed to a similar destruction of climax. ALL the songs, instead they're separated masterpieces, were put in the worst place. Of course the author have a minimum reason to that selection, but wasn't the best."
"maxdest","8","1","5","19 March 2009"," Good, but could have been better
","As someone whom has never read the graphic novel, I read a few of the reviews here and was afraid that I might find the plot incomprehensible. I am glad to say that I understood pretty much everything, and it was good.<br/><br/>Just like '300' and 'Sin City' the visual imagery in Watchmen is outstanding, with many scenes of breathtaking beauty, however unlike the aforementioned, Watchmen also makes excellent use of symbolism and repartition which enhance the impact of a storyline already laden with some deep examination of a range of human values. In places this is very subtle, and may be missed by those whom are used to a pure action fest, no more so than the impact and amazing irony present within the finale. In many ways Watchmen is like an art-house movie with a Hollywood budget... amazing.<br/><br/>That is not to say all is good. Whilst Jackie Earle Haley as the moral-psychopath Rorschach gives a performance that will surely yield an academy nomination, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives us a likewise consummate Comedian, the other characters are found lacking to a greater of lesser degree.<br/><br/>In addition, the film is nearly three bottom-aching hours long, which would be fine if there was no-nonsense. But with many extended ultra-slow gore shots and an unnecessarily long sex scene or three I think at least 15 minutes could have been chopped off without any loss, and they might have got a lower rating.<br/><br/>Some people moan about the soundtrack, but I thought it was used to a decent effect, and provided some (intentional) gallows humor in a film that is otherwise of an extremely dark tone.<br/><br/>All in all, a good film that could have been great if only for better casting and a shorter cut."
"jeanbal","10","1","5","17 March 2009"," A masterpiece
","I have loved the Watchmen since the first time I read the comic, back in the 80s. For many years, I have prayed for a good director to adapt this story to the big screen. Terry Gilliam almost did it... And I was sure that nobody could ever do justice to this extraordinary epic. I was wrong. Snyder has done the impossible: to give life to the Watchmen and - most importantly - to the message behind the story. A message of peace and mistrust which would have prevented W. to do much harm if it had been spread before. As you can guess, I simply love this movie. Every single scene, every single shot is a splendor to my eyes. And, even if Alan Moore wrote that more than 20 years ago, the plot is still relevant today. This sad, violent, wonderful and crazy story has a lot to teach to all the world citizens. Our civilization is in danger, and peace is under a permanent threat. And BTW, I can't understand the people obsessed by Doc Manathan blue penis. It is not ugly, nor gross. It is just na-tu-ral. And I did not find the love scene shocking at all. The music - Allelujah by Leonard Cohen - tells all. It is a LOVE story, not a sex show! Is it so extraordinary? Couples can sometimes love each other spiritually AND physically. Only porn addicts could think otherwise! That people can be tilted by that kind of detail tells a lot about the world we live in. We can stand the murder of thousand Iraqi kids by bombs dropped from the skies in the name of democracy. But a ""blue penis""??? How disgusting!!! ;-)"
"Norway1","8","1","5","10 March 2009"," Can barely be called a movie at all
","More aptly, ""An Experience"" (as a friend pointed out during the end credits)...<br/><br/>Opening Night with 3 friends: One knew NOTHING of the film or book (had seen the trailer, that's all) and expected this to be like X-Men (boy was he in for a shock!), one was an old-school fan, like myself, and one (his girlfriend) was newly introduced to the book and had read it a few weeks before the film's release.<br/><br/>I was mostly worried about how my uninitiated friend (who was expecting the X-Men) would react. I was nervous throughout the film - especially during the more wordy scenes - that he would not like it or not understand it. This guy is a Truck Driver. Mostly into horror movies like the new Halloween and Devil's Rejects and he liked 300. So he really digs hardcore violence, action and gore and isn't usually so big on story. However, one of his favorite movies is No Country For Old Men, so I knew there was hope! :)<br/><br/>Well, he says he loved it! He realized about 10 minutes in that this was not going to be anything like he expected. He changed viewing modes from ""sit back and enjoy the popcorn"" to ""pay attention, this is deep and important."" My other two friends loved it too. The girlfriend is the one who said, ""This is one of those few movies where you want to walk out, buy another ticket, and go right back in to watch it again."" And ""This is hardly like a movie and more of An Experience"".<br/><br/>She's right. Absolutely. But I'm not sure I embrace it whole heartedly. Part of me thinks it would have been better if it was in fact more like a movie and less like a graphic-novel put to screen.<br/><br/>For one, there was far too much dialog and not enough emotion or ""acting"". While Rorschach, Manhattan and Dan/Night Owl were great, Laurie and Veidt were hardly watchable. Really!<br/><br/>Laurie was played as a shallow, naive, sex-dependent, childish brat. Granted, she was never that exciting in the book but I would have preferred a more interesting character than a shallow facsimile of the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Veidt played as a monotone, emotionless, brainiac villain. He never seemed convinced of his own convictions and always appeared to be bored out of his mind.<br/><br/>The scenes with Dr. Manhattan (especially on Mars) were far too stuffed of dialog. The movie could have been cut down 20 minutes if more time was spent showing emotion and less on exposition and pointless dialog. Did we really need to hear philosophical exposition on quantum mechanics and physics? While it might have worked in the book (I had to force myself NOT to skip over it to get to ""the good stuff"") it could have been avoided in the film, replaced with music and the flashbacks. Did we need more?<br/><br/>One very minor gripe is the need to call the group ""Watchmen"". I was hoping that Dan's line in the trailer was the only time we would hear it, but I counted 5 times, spoken by Dan, Rorschach and Veidt. So it's not just a subtle line thrown in but a part of the story. No more ""Crime Busters"" (which was intended to sound silly).<br/><br/>And then there's the ""old"" makeup. Unforgivably bad. Gawd Awful! Just plain amateurish. Seriously, how they could get so much right on the visual side, but completely drop the ball on makeup is beyond me. And since I'm not alone in spotting it (Garth Franklin, etc) it's more than just a minor annoyance.<br/><br/>My final complaint would be the overly exaggerated action scenes - particularly during the finale at Antarctica. These guys are SUPPOSED to be normal humans. NOT real superheros. That's part of the point and it's completely lost during the last battle sequence. People are thrown 10 feet in the air, smashing pieces of concrete without pause. It really just looked ridiculous. Like one of the old Batman movies or worse the Batman TV show. All we lacked was the ""Wham!"" and ""Pow!"" blurbs.<br/><br/>One complaint I have heard which I can NOT AGREE with is that the music was terribly bad. That the songs almost never matched the scenes. This is so completely wrong that I wonder why one would even suggest it. To me everything worked so well I was absolutely stunned. I was skeptical about the music going in but agreed with every single piece I heard. All the songs worked perfectly with their scenes, from Simon and Garfunkel to Jimmy Hendrix to Philip Glass. Absolute, pure Genius!<br/><br/>So why do I rate the film 7/10 with so many complaints? Really, I did like the film and could write more good about it than bad. But so many other reviewers have done that and better than I could. I agree with much of what has been said. The main point in its favor is what my friend said when we walked out. It's unlike ANY movie I have ever seen before. It's more of an ""experience"" - one that should be repeated as many times as possible in the ideal format of the Big Screen. Preferably, I presume, on Imax (we don't have one in Norway).<br/><br/>EDIT: After a couple weeks I have increased my rating to 8/10. It really grows on me over time. It may even go up more but for now I think 8 is the right score."
"hockeyrage88","6","1","5","9 March 2009"," Ambitious, and for filmmakers, there is a lesson to be learned here.
","The first thing I discussed with my fellow 'Watchmen' attendees last night was- if you were to try to briefly explain to someone what the movie 'Watchmen' is about, what would you say? None of us could come up with a succinct answer.<br/><br/>My only attempt at an explanation is this.<br/><br/>'Watchmen' tries to be about everything. <br/><br/>So many topics and themes are tackled in this film, from environmental issues to child abduction, from politics to sexual assault, from war to love. <br/><br/>While the film does provide some interesting insights in these topics, it is really too much for one film.<br/><br/>We were actually trying to identify the protagonist, and the best I could come up with is Rorschach, since he does the voice over narration and keeps the journal. I think he is also the most sympathetic character, because there is such a disconnection felt with most of the other characters. <br/><br/>I understand that some of these complaints perhaps are directed more at the book than the film, and I have not read the book. But, it is the job of the filmmakers to shape the story of the book into a film that the audience can connect with, and I believe that in trying to keep too true to this book, the writers of 'Watchmen' the movie lost most of their audience. <br/><br/>'Watchmen' is a joy to the eye, as the art direction is top notch. The opening credits sequence is stunningly brilliant in its cinematography and as an expository storytelling device.<br/><br/>Every movie is about something, but unfortunately, Watchmen is not. Because it tries to be about everything, it is actually about nothing."
"Reef-Shark","6","1","5","9 March 2009"," I am torn on what to rate this
","Upon seeing this movie I wrote an initial review of my opinion, but realized there was something wrong with it. The problem was that I was spending more time praising Moore's novel than the actual movie, so I deleted it and decided to start from scratch after spending a good deal of time reflecting on the movie and flipping through the panels of the comic.<br/><br/>On one hand I love Moore's original story and comic. On the other hand I am not very fond of director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of Dawn of the Dead and 300).<br/><br/>On one hand this movie mimics the visual style of the novel very well and looks very well polished. On the other hand Snyder and his team in their dedication to perfectly mimicking the story of the graphic novel have made this final product come across as very mechanical and unmoving.<br/><br/>So many things done right, but so many done wrong...<br/><br/>For the most part the actors pull of their parts, but none of them really go above and beyond to truly make the characters anything more than iconic images lovingly ripped from the panels of Moore's story. There were only two actors who I felt really tried to do something with their characters in an attempt to enhance the characters, and they were Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian. Aside from these two performances I feel that most of the actors were so determined to fit Snyder's idea of matching the book perfectly that they failed to take the initiative to really try and break the wall and make this movie more than the graphic novel put into motion. But, not to leave him out of this review Billy Crudup did do a satisfactory performance behind the make-up and special effects for his portrayal of Doctor Manhattan, but it wasn't good enough to really get my attention when compared to Earle Haley and Dean Morgan.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes I found the acting of Patrick Wilson (Nite Owl II) and Malin Ackerman (Silk Spectre II) to be undeniably stiff in both their respective roles, but the actor who managed to disappoint me most in the entire production would have to be Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt (AKA: Ozymandias). This man lacked the charisma, and charm I felt when reading the character in the book, and Goode just seems to have no emotion, simply being there to show off his fancy hair, and talk in his accented voice, but I will also say Wilson and Ackerman are only better by a small notch. The performances of these three individuals as a whole were some of the key reasons Watchmen disappointed me as a film.<br/><br/>Even with acting problems the production is a good and it is strong. The images are dazzling, and very true to the comic. It is definitely one of best providers of eye candy we're likely to see 2009, but then we have to remember visuals aren't everything, and that's why I was let down by this film.<br/><br/>My biggest problem, as I have previously mentioned, is the lack of initiative that the production crew took when making this film. It's like they took up a diet of respectively redoing the comic for twelve weeks until they remembered each panel perfectly and made the actors do the same. Most of the actors don't look like they're really into their roles, and the production is just a fanboy dream come true, but it manages to do one thing that made me mad that keeps me from rating this higher than a seven.<br/><br/>If this had just been a visual comic down to the letter I would probably give it an 8/10, but the few times Snyder decides to take action and add in his own little ideas to the plot it just really distracted me from the concept of the story, and ruined the mood for me. What is it that Snyder is adding that angers me so much? Perhaps the most pointless gore and drawn out sex scenes I have ever seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>The gore is tacky, and cheap, and distracts from the story, and philosophy behind the images. Many of these images were not in the graphic novel, and nor were they ever even HINTED in the graphic novel. In this movie we have arms broken wide open, a man has his arms cut off, and a man repeatedly has his head cut into by a meat cleaver. None of these moments ever took place in the graphic novel, and I felt they threw off the pace, and distracted the viewers from what was actually going on, and I won't even talk about how he drew out a sex scene that was like six-panels into a 5-10 minute scene.<br/><br/>My favorite part was by far the opening credits, and I don't say that in a bad way because it was really a brilliant way to open the movie. To the tune of 'The Times They Are A Changin' we get an animated series of photos that maps out most of the Watchmen's history, the universe they live in, and the setting for the rest of the film. This moment alone makes this movie a must-see for fans of the comics.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film very positively because I for one was disappointed by the finished product. I'm sure many will rave about this film, and it's sure to become a cult-classic, but compared to the graphic novel it really is nothing. Watchmen may be the most endearing comic of all time, and is a classic for the medium, but as a film its impact will not be as lasting as films such as last year's The Dark Knight."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","5","8 March 2009"," Is It Worth The Wait?
","I think it goes without saying that the film would never be as good as the book. It's a statement that is so obvious that I'm surprised I'm even stating it here. In reviewing a film based on literature, one should make the distinction of not really comparing the two. It's simply not fair. Comparisons will rise, no doubt, but the two mediums are vastly different. With books, you can go anywhere, do anything, nothing is limited. Film on the other hand, has so many limitations that it feels like it should be viewed in a category on it's own. <br/><br/>The film is a pretty accurate depiction of the novel, the changes that were made I had no opposition to. Things were obviously left out, some things I knew would be gone, some things I hoped would make it in. The film clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, so it may seem like it will drag in places and near the end it does. Whenever Dr. Manhattan was on the screen, I was so happy. He was a marvel in the book and here as well. Every time he was on the screen I was glued to it, could not look away. Although, when on Mars when he is discussing he feelings with humanity, I found myself slightly bored. Which is a shame because it is a pivotal moment in the film. Billy Crudup plays a character devoid of any emotion. He pulls it off. I enjoyed his performance. During the trailer I was upset with his voice, but during the film I did not mind it. I loved his eyes and every little turn of his head.<br/><br/>Malin Akerman on the other hand has gotten a lot of flack for her performance and I say it was because the character isn't even likable. I found her annoying and whiny, here she just seems boring. No connection to Manhattan, but more importantly Dan. I just did not really buy their relationship on screen. She does look beautiful in (and out) of that suit though and can kick some ass. Speaking of Dan, Night Owl is two characters. A kickass superhero and an overweight man who needs his glasses to see. Wilson captured both pretty well. His nervousness is there and I thought he brought that character to life. The one casting spot the fans seemed to hate the most, I enjoyed quite a bit. Matthew Goode did a decent job here, much to my surprise, even though I knew he wasn't going to be as bad as people were saying.<br/><br/>Both Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan play the psychopaths in this flick. Morgan shows his stuff in the characters flashbacks, aging from a young arrogant bastard, to an old crying slob. After his introduction and flashback scenes he has nothing else to do with the film and I wanted to see more of his sorry ass. Haley was the highlight of the film for me. What a badass character he gets to play, with the mask on and off. He pulled it off extremely well.<br/><br/>Why oh why did the make-up department fail so badly though? Looking at Silk Spectre in her old age was horrible. She looks like she had play dough rubbed on her face, Nixon too. Even The Comedian to an extent, whose fight sequence went on a tad too long. Punching through walls, really? The soundtrack was spot on, maybe too spot on for some, but I dug it. The film's highlight, other than Dr. Manhattan's origins telling, is the fantastic montage opening credits to the tune of Bob Dylan. I loved it. Couldn't get enough of it. It immediately sets you in this alternate universe and you know the history. Pick up the soundtrack, I know I will.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful, no question . Sin City had it's own atmosphere, as did 300 and now Watchmen. I just didn't sit there and see this world they were living in, I felt a part of it. I loved the blue of Manhattan glowing everywhere, I loved the neon signs and the gritty streets.<br/><br/>Some parts did have the Zack Snyder stamp all over them, most notably the prison scene in which Night Owl and Spectre II fight off some prisoners down the corridor. Just seemed like 300 all over again to me. I did enjoy Rorschach kicking ass though. Snyder's pacing was a bit off as well, time spent on some characters more greatly then others. His choice to have the characters seem more super than human was also a bit weird. This was most noticeable in the climax when characters are bouncing off solid objects and nothing really seems to happen to them.<br/><br/>A lot of the core themes and elements were sort of lost to me in the translation. Viewers will get lost in the gorgeousness of it and might miss the smaller parts that really make Watchmen what it is. These characters are not super at all, they all have problems. I feel that many people will miss this, the film kind of did. Give me more little things with the main characters. Rorschach is suppose to be the psychopath, yet he seems to be the only one with a level head on his shoulders most of the time.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is a good adaptation of the book. I enjoyed it on it's own merits and on the comparison to the source material. At times it tries to be brilliant, like the novel, but it doesn't come off like that. I wanted the entire film to be brilliant, but ended up with an entertaining movie that I would love to watch over again and again."

","In an alternate version of the mid-eighties where Nixon is serving a third term, costumed heroes are outlawed, but they must unite to fight an oncoming threat. That's a shabby outline, but it's hard to summarize this plot. I read the comic book this is based on, and the adaptation turned out pretty much exactly as I expected: faithful but lacking most of the book's more subtle shadings.<br/><br/>Watchmen is one of those things people have long said couldn't be filmed. They were wrong, and this is about as good a job as anyone could be expected to do. But it still left me unsatisfied. It's certainly entertaining, and the movie gets the characters right (especially my favourite, Rorschach, thanks in large part to actor Jackie Earle Haley). The book is dark, moody, and ambiguous whereas this is a loud and boisterous action film. One of the main problems is that it makes every character ""cool"", which takes away some of the depth found in the book. It also fails to provide a proper build-up to the reveal of the ""villain""'s plan (which has been changed from the book to something rather mundane). And the fight scenes are generically shot. Director Zack Snyder really needs to lose his distracting affectation of switching from slow motion to regular speed."
"brandon-boulay","5","1","5","8 March 2009"," Watchmen review in the sense of an adaptation
","When dealing with an adaptation like this it is hard to judge one piece without judging the other (the original). I felt that watchmen took a ballsy approach to dealing with the graphic novel both a visual sense and with how it dealt with the story (plot/characters/dialogue, etc.).<br/><br/>Knowing that Zach Snyder is a die hard comic fan, I know he had good intentions with dealing with this piece and probably equally understood the challenges and pressures from the creators of the comic and it's fans alike.<br/><br/>I think Snyder did a good job referencing the comic book, I feel that much of panels are brought to life in the frames of this film. For example, it appears that Snyder and his production designer made a perfect floor plan of the Night Owl's lair from the frames the comic, everything from the staircase to the cabinets to which way his spaceship/hero-cruising-vessel faced in relation to the comic frames. I think this shows a great attention to detail, the mood transfers well from the literary piece to the visual, even with the changes made. In the opening scene when The Comedian is murdered, the book's color scheme is dark and cold, but focuses on the color red, the film's adapted this scene very well in its cold and dark feeling but went with a blue color scheme. While this may seem minimal to some people's eyes, I feel that one of the comics main driving force is its use of color.<br/><br/>In the sense of the story, I think Snyder tried to keep as much of it as possible, but by doing that I think the film felt long, sluggish and boring at many parts. Some may argue that this shows a faithful respect to the adapted material. On the other hand I would argue that in this case (most of the time) it is quality over quantity. I feel by Snyder trying to minimize cuts to the story he compromised its quality as it loses its pizazz in the conversion from page to celluloid.<br/><br/>My grade: c+"

","For me I would have to give Watchmen a 10 out of 10, because I was such a huge fan of the graphic novel, and have been waiting for watchmen ever since I saw that it was finally going to be released after over 20 years in the making. Zach Synder's version of Watchmen will not disappoint at all.<br/><br/>However first and foremost I must give a warning. This is not A super hero movie. I knew many people going in to see this movie think it is and have not read the graphic novel. This is the type of movie where if you have read the graphic novel then you will love the film, if not you probably won't. Also the average Joe who watches this film simply won't get it and all the ideas and topics Watchmen covers. It really is a story of absolute brilliance, Realistically this is most people in the theaters nowadays who think that spider man is deep and think movies like meet the Spartans are funny, they see the trailer for watchmen and go wow that's about superheros, they will be hugely disappointed and upset.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a long slow epic movie much like how the graphic novel was. Zach Synder changes very little and sticks very true to the original story using even the same dialogue that was written in the graphic novel. However some minor changes are made and some scenes were cut but honestly you don't notice them at all except for the biggest change of the film....the ending. Zach Synder had changed the ending of the film because most people who have not read the book would be puzzled as to what was happening and how something that crazy would be put into this film. However The ending is hardly changed that much at all and it works, basically it's the same as in the Novel but they changed how the city get's attacked. Honestly it works, and being a fan of the novel i did not mind at all, but I would have liked to see what the original ending would have looked like especially when Zach Synder stayed true to the Novel the whole movie.<br/><br/>The violence in the movie is also quite brutal like who it was in the novel. Many people in the theater had trouble watching some of it especially the women in the theater when the silk spectre was getting raped. The violence in the movie does not happen often but when it does it comes on fully force and once again Zach Synder does it with amazing style. Warning to parent's also this is not a movie for children as it contains strong graphic violence, Sexual Content/nudity , and disturbing themes and contents throughout the film and graphic novel. To conclude simply if you have read the graphic novel or are smart enough to get what Watchmen talks about then you will love this film, if not you will hate it and should go watch disaster movie and meet the Spartans again."

","After months, months, and months of anticipation, last night i was fortunate to attend ""Watchmen"" with my girlfriend @ Edwards Cinema in San Marcos, CA. We both have not read the graphic novel nor knew much about it, if any.I was not sure what to expect as i walked into the theater although my expectations were very high i felt that i could be greatly disappointed.<br/><br/>From what i discovered so far is that the movie replicates the book with almost every scene and sequence.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder who you may know as the director of ""300"" did an amazing job once again with the ""Watchmen"".<br/><br/>He has an amazing eye for visual details, as well as adapting this movie to the novel. Die hard fans of the book may disagree. I..ll tell them HEY! This is a movie not a novel! Not everything will be perfect, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The Movie starts out with The Comedian being murdered, Which is an exciting action packed scene and does its job of setting the tone of the film and gets you ready for the next 2 1/2 hours. Then there's a long clip of clips showing the Superheroes of the past and how times are changing and lets newcomers (like me) pick up on the story. Then the movie actually starts. There is a lot to digest and the visuals are incredible. I advise you not to get distracted from the big picture. The complex story leads to the interaction of the unique characters as the main focal point to understanding the film.<br/><br/>All the suites are very well created with just the right effect. Dr. Manhatting could not look any better. As for the actors, i should say that they were all GREAT! The washed up burn out ""Rorschach"" was probably one of my favorite characters. He definitely carried the film for a while not to mention how entertaining he was to listen to.This film balanced action and the storyline very well. Plenty of nudity, gore, and violence.<br/><br/>The Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) did a superb job with her role and i believe many people will find it easy to feel the adoration with her character.<br/><br/>All in all ""Watchmen"" took a dark, deep, and complex view into the superhero world. It is no ordinary superhero movie. It takes your brain on a roller-coaster and leaves you wanting more. There is no doubt that this film was everything i was hoping for and will be a success. There were a couple of things i would have changed in the last 5 minutes and i do wish i saw it in IMAX. However, i do not want to take you away from the overall quality of this film. So i will leave it at that.<br/><br/>I give the ""Watchmen"" a 9 out of 10."

","OK, yes I loved the twelve issue comic series/graphic novel and blah blah. The movie itself is great. Is it the same as the graphic novel? No, but very close in most of the ways that counts. Some aspects were left out, some were sort of meshed together and some were new. You would expect this from a movie adaptation but you will be surprised to how well these things don't matter and how few there are. The basic concept is there and the actors bring it to life.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Spider-man, X-men, and so forth, this is not the same type of movie that they are. This one is more akin to V for Vendetta (thanks again Mr. Moore) with even stronger concepts and wide angles. I would not avoid this movie if you like those types of movies, just know that it is a different story that just so happens to have men and women that dress up in it.<br/><br/>Like the 12 issues original series, this movie has everything going on in it and if you are a fan of the work then it is a must see.<br/><br/>My father watched it and did not know anything about the watchmen and he enjoyed it as well."
"moviewizguy","7","1","5","7 March 2009"," Justice is coming to all of us. No matter what we do.
","An adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book series, Watchmen is a story set in an alternative 1985, where the world is ticking closer to the brink of nuclear war, and a plot to eliminate a band of ex-crimefighters is instigated, but why? and by whom? It is up to two of those ex-crimefighters to investigate the plot that seems to go beyond the unthinkable.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" fell into traps. The first trap was a lawsuit from 20th Century Fox to Warner Bros. For better or worse, they negotiated a deal and had the film released in its appropriate date. The second trap is from the publicity itself. Now I'm sure many beloved fans would love to see the movie, and there's no reason to blame them. However, there are many other people who have never read the graphic novel in their entire life. However, that won't stop them because the marketing looked fantastic, the trailers and commercials showing cool, zesty special effects with some cool actions scenes all directed by the cool guy who did ""300,"" Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>This is the downfall. What the marketing don't show is that the film is about three hours long, has very little to no action scenes, and it's very talky. Now why is that the problem? For those who haven't read the graphic novel, including myself, they'll be stuck in a, jumbled, incoherent piece of narrative that doesn't stop until the end. Throughout the movie, I wanted to kill myself, honestly. I was so tired by the first act that even I wouldn't have cared if the movie ended or not. It just wasn't interesting. And that's what many of you non-fans will suffer through the film.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the movie is bad. It just appeals more to the fans than account to the others. Like I said, the movie is so very long and the pace is just uneven. Action scenes come up randomly just to keep the audience awake. Other elements that would keep them awake is the visually extensive look of the film. I must say, by technical standards, the movie looks fantastic, giving a noir-neo look. Just like ""300,"" Snyder would get every chance he has to milk some visually creative scenes for some time.<br/><br/>When there are some action scenes, which won't be very many, they are done very well, to say the least. Like the rest of the film, the scenes are set up perfectly to bring out the best possible response from the audience. The music choice is very odd, though. Sometimes, they work well, like the opening sequence and other times, they're downright horrible. As for the performances themselves, nobody actually stood out for me. Many are saying Jackie Earle Haley did a good job, but I found him quite annoying with his ""Christian Bale-in-Batman-form-voice."" I found him very incomprehensible that I begged for subtitles to appear to understand what he's trying to say.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was just confusing and incoherent. I wasn't interest at all of what's going on and who's going to die. When the plot does start to move, it's sometimes very predictable on what's going happen, which is pretty ironic because the film tries to be thought-provoking. Under the messy, uneven film, one can actually see it has little to nothing to say or that it didn't say anything different from previous superhero films that have been done before already. Director Snyder has a good eye, I'll give him that, but the rest of the film just falls down from a non-fan point of view. If you're not a fan, don't bother wasting your time. After all, it's almost three hours long. If you're a fan, go ahead and watch it. Enjoy it."
"ferguson-6","7","1","5","7 March 2009"," You're in here with ME!
","Greetings again from the darkness. While not a rabid, obsessed fan of Alan Moore's graphic novel, I certainly enjoyed the read and was anxious for the film (for about 15 years now!) Director Zach Snyder (""300"") stays very close to script with a product that should please all but the most persnickety fans.<br/><br/>The film is a hard ""R"" rating and I just couldn't believe how many under 10 year olds were in the theatre. Why so many idiot parents? The violence and gore is brutal and graphic. The film unquestionably sets the cinematic record for most screen time for a blue penis. This is not Bugs Bunny folks, this is an adult presentation of a graphic novel ... and a very good and unique one, at that.<br/><br/>Overall I was pretty pleased with the casting. Billy Crudup (Almost Famous) as Dr Manhattan (voice and head) was plenty mystical, Malin Akerman (27 Dresses) surprises as Silk Spectre II, while Carla Gugino was a bit over the top as her mom. Jeffrey Dean Morgan's too brief Comedian turn was excellent and Patrick Wilson was fine as the soulful Nite Owl and slightly wimpy Dan Dreiberg ... complete with the Clark Griswald eyeglasses. While the weak link was unfortunately Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, the unquestionable strength of the cast was Jackie Earle Haley as the hardened Rorschach. His scenes are fascinating ... as is that terrific ink blot mask! <br/><br/>Snyder does a good job with the soundtrack, though it easily qualifies as the oddest placement for the great Leonard Cohen's song ""Hallelujah"". Stay for the credits to catch Leonard's ""First we take Manhattan"". The absolute best sequence of the film is the historical montage featuring highlights of the heroes' early years played over Dylan's ""The Times They are a'Changin'"". Sure the ending was changed out of necessity and it is a bit long in running time, but Snyder has done a wonderful job with the outstanding source material and this one can be watched and enjoyed a few times."
"pyrocitor","8","1","5","6 March 2009"," The insurmountable barrier of expectations - an excellent film, but never the graphic novel
","How to film the ""unfilmable""? The ever recurring question, cycling through decades of development on adapting Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's cherished graphic novel Watchmen, into a motion picture, including several defeated attempts by directors as prestigious as Terry Gilliam, Paul Greengrass and Darren Aronofsky) appeared to have finally found an answer in director Zack Snyder. Fresh off a similarly vigilantly faithful comic book adaptation of Frank Miller's 300, Snyder's vow to cherish the graphic novel as his bible throughout film-making appeared the crucial solution to the incredible difficulty of transferring the staggering variety of thematic, social and political content of Moore's dark exploration and subversion of the superhero myth: keep as much of it intact on screen as possible to satisfy the die-hard fans, without alienating those uninitiated with the source text. However, Snyder's slavish dedication to the graphic novel ultimately proves to be both Watchmen's greatest strength and most profound failure, resulting in a film which is within earshot of greatness, and yet is never quite the Watchmen of expectations.<br/><br/>For any familiar with the graphic novel, divorcing awareness of it is simply never an option, as the substantial replication continually begs a comparison which it would seem could ultimately never prove satisfactory. And yet Snyder gives it his all, showcasing the aesthetic sensibilities honed in 300 to an astonishing degree, crafting a world of dulled hues of vibrant colours, lavish costuming and sets with an alarmingly pitch perfect professional gloss. However, as laudable as his respect for the text is, as the film unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that Snyder was simultaneously both the best and worst candidate for the directorial position. For all of his passionate adherence to his text, Snyder remains principally a visual director, and such passion does not carry through to properly mining the lusciously rich dimensions of Moore's work. Beyond the pristine exteriors, there lurks a haunting lack of depth and substance, a surprisingly hollow absence of the real feeling and emotional core of the graphic novel a director such as Aronofsky or Gilliam may have sunk their cinematic teeth into. As such, despite the meticulous recreation of nearly all the narrative and political subtexts of Moore's work (apart from the famously altered ending, which admirably accomplishes nearly the same intent as the text's), the underlying passion and emotional undertones which made them light up with such vibrant urgency are mostly lost. Nonetheless, there are moments... fleeting moments of such inspired, spot-on power and poignancy (Rorschach's backstory and an inspired use of the textually quoted ""All Along the Watchtower"" song across the arctic, among others) which spike above the film as a whole and hint at the masterful adaptation which might have been.<br/><br/>And yet, even such a comparatively pale shadow of the original proves an utterly exhausting experience, particularly for those unfamiliar with the text itself. While Snyder accomplishes a valiant job of retaining the narrative while truncating it into a palatable fashion for the uninitiated, viewers may still find the length, pacing and sheer mass of information presented daunting and somewhat of a struggle to ingest. Snyder's overly trendy cinematic sensibilities hardly help the matter, attempting to punch up the excitement factor of an extremely long, mostly narrative and character driven superhero film with sporadic slow- motion inundated and frenzied, garishly violent fight scenes, which, though enthralling and often gruesomely engrossing, prove so tiresomely in tune with recent action movie conventions such sequences adapt a look sure to appear incredibly dated within a short matter of years. A musical score which proves incongruous and jarring as often as subversively fitting and occasionally frustratingly clichÃ©d similarly reinforces the uneasy veneer.<br/><br/>Despite admirable attempts by the cast, many struggle to fully capture and convey the essence of Moore's convoluted characters. Jackie Earle Haley proves the triumphant exception as psychopathic, stoic yet perversely honourable vigilante Rorschach. Haley's grim, caustic performance grows on the viewer like a festering sore, triggering exactly what Rorschach is, and bringing to life a character for the ages. Patrick Wilson similarly proves perfectly attuned to his over the hill Nite Owl, charismatically channelling the character's nerdiness, heroic impotence (in more ways than one) and eventual rebirth through embracing potentially out of date heroic norms. However, they prove the exceptions, as Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II is essentially reduced to gratuitous eye candy (which, given her infuriating deprivation of character development, is about all the character's inclusion seems meant for) but does not rise to her rare occasions to shine, showcasing a troublesome lack of dramatic ability or screen presence during crucial emotional scenes. Billy Crudup also struggles to balance godlike Dr. Manhattan's near robotic detachment and muted emotion (but, to his credit, retains impressive dignity for a consistently naked blue man), and Matthew Goode proves too watered down to fully nail the arrogant superiority of superhero entrepreneur Ozymandias. The most noticeable is Jeffery Dean Morgan as the nihilistic 'Comedian' - Morgan simply lacks the necessary spark of acerbic energy to make the Comedian work as a character, his muted performance failing to properly channel the ferocious, subversively charming snarl the narrative's series of flashbacks revolve around, perhaps resulting in the film's emotional punch remaining vaguely elusive. <br/><br/>The fact that Snyder's Watchmen is as strong a film as it is is an incredible accomplishment in itself, yet it consistently leaves one yearning for the deeper, more rich film glimpsed only in tantalizing moments. If anything, the conclusion can be drawn that if such an overall incredibly strong adaptation can still be found to be lacking the necessary spark of the text, than the idea of a universally satisfying Watchmen film may remain forever a pipe dream. Perhaps ""unfilmable"" proved a more fitting epitaph than expected - but, having been filmed, the enormous dedication and quality of Snyder's work cannot be ignored, and his Watchmen is without question accessible and well worth watching for fans and non-fans alike.<br/><br/>-7.5/10"

"Leofwine_draca","8","1","6","2 December 2016"," Character-focused superhero epic is a cut above the rest
","Despite being a big, overblown, bloated and occasionally dull film, WATCHMEN is one worth watching. That's because director Zach Snyder has been as faithful to Alan Moore's original graphic novel as he was to Frank Miller's when he made 300. This is a film made by a fan for the fans, so it's no surprise that those of us who don't read comics are going to be slightly bemused when watching this in places.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a superhero movie that provides a refreshing change from the mild-mannered likes of Spider-Man and the X-Men franchises which are geared at a child audience. This one is a bleak, nihilistic adult production all the way, filled with graphic violence and sexuality in a complete turn about from your typical superhero yarn. It's also far more interesting in getting into the psychology of the characters and showing what's making them tick. The surprise is that these guys aren't good guys at all: they're either too human or hardly human at all, and as a unit they're hard to like. I can't help but think this a more realistic portrayal of what the role of a superhero would actually do to a person's mind than we usually see in cinemas.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, the cast is great. Honours especially go to Jackie Earle Haley, whose character Rorschach is a complete sociopath and yet the movie's most appealing character. Next up is Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who dies in the first scene but whose ethos and personality dominate the rest of the movie to come; he's fantastic. Kudos should also go to Billy Crudup, who undergoes the motion capture routine most famously used by Andy Serkis in his portrayal of Gollum in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy; Crudup's cold, impersonal Dr Manhattan is one of the most bizarre and intriguing characters ever put on screen. I was less happy about the angsty problems faced by romantic couple Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson, but there you go.<br/><br/>Of course, there are highly choreographed fight scenes here, as well as ships flying around and wonderful monuments on Mars; all of the trappings you'd expect from the genre. But it's the touches of character that make this difficult and worth a watch. Rorschach's confrontation of a serial killer in his home is a highlight, as is his brief sojourn in a tough jail. Okay, so the film ends with a whimper rather than a bang, and there are flaws that inevitably come from making such a hugely epic movie, but WATCHMEN is the intriguing oddity of the year."

","This kind of movie is one that I would normally ignore. My tastes don't go to these big budget special effects things, but it was available and I had heard my son talk about it. It took me a while to get the idea. I don't read graphic novels and so I had to educate myself concerning the characters. Over time I began to realize that this is a telling of history as if it had gone a different direction during the Nixon era. The world changed and not for the better. Superheroes who could only help on a limited basis have been kept from their task and retired into relative obscurity. Everything picks up when a character called the Comedian is killed (and that takes some doing). I was really impressed by the world created and by how these figures (who are really multi-dimensional) start to interact. There are both cosmic and societal forces that are linked and the governments of the big countries have no idea what is going on. That includes Nixon and Kissinger who are odd to look at, especially with that putty ski jump nose of Nixon's. All in all, it works very well and has a lot of suspense and a very satisfying conclusion. At first I thought it was way too long, but I soon came to realize that the complexities of the social milieu and the number of characters, as well as the need to use flashback to show us where these people had been in the past, made it necessary. While it is incredibly violent and unsettling, it's worth the effort."

There is a DVD that just came out that contains an animated version of the story-within-a-story, and it's highly recommended.

","Knowing almost nothing about the book, the watchmen carried no biases or expectations. However, it was a painful, prepubescent, dark, shallow-pointless - an ultra violent spectacle driven mostly by slow plot development and over the top special effects and cursing.<br/><br/>Certainly there IS a plot here but it moves quite slowly with purpose and symbolism somewhat lost even if you strip back the special effects and gore. Seemingly the plot tried draw on some kind of twisted reality built on simplistic references to American history even going as far as replicating famous faces such as Nixon, Dan Rather, and Kissenger. Instead of adding to the film, it only enhanced a feeling of pointless clutter.<br/><br/>The super hero's looked like lame cheap knockoffs (except for the digital Dr. Manhatten) who went around glorifying violence (and murder) as they performed dark justice on anyone who was in their way. Sadly, even the slow motion Matrix-like fighting sequences (with an emphasis on gore) seemed to be begging for attention.<br/><br/>As the plot dragged on and on, it sadly turned me into the watchman of the digital clock on my cell phone - Eventually I walked out of the theater after about 1 hour of trying to say interested. <br/><br/>In the end, I was left with an empty feeling one might get from an emptying and entire bag of greasy popcorn - and like the movie, something probably only enjoyed without recourse by a teenager. I would recommend that you watch for the DVD."

There's a LOT of filler in the book that really slowed the story down. Unfortunately, Zack Snyder's insistence on staying true to the book meant these flaws were translated onto the screen. The movie could have used some good editing. Various ideas and scenes could have been condensed. Unfortunately, the final product was a rather slow paced movie with a rather muddled storyline and ideas. Snyder also dropped much of the dark humor elements in the book. On the good side: The acting was well-done. The art direction stunning. The changed ending I felt worked better. Bottom line: a Graphic Novel is NOT a film.

","I have never read the book or heard very much about the book to make any comparison. I did just go see the movie. I thought the movie had a great story line and the action was awesome. I have one problem with the film, or maybe more the rating. I am a 25 year old male and by no means a prude, but the R rating this movie received is far to nice. Please be warned that your teenage kids who are into comics will get far more than they bargained for. The R rating states brief nudity and sexual content. My experience with this movie is that the nudity is not brief, and the sexual content was very explicit (far worse than showgirls which received an NC-17 rating). The theater I was in had teenage kids (probably between 13 and 16 years old). The sex scenes in this film reach far above this age limit. I guess my gripe is with the rating company and not the movie. Parents, here is your warning, if you don't want your children to see sexual acts being performed don't take them to this movie."

","I think I may have had too much of a biased opinion when I saw this film, because I had just finished reading the graphic novel, which I do recommend. So plot wise I knew everything that was going to happen and all the little fussy details were still fresh in my mind. Yet, it is unfair to say that a movie must follow every detail of its former medium, because that would just be pointless. This movie disappointed me in other ways.<br/><br/>For one, it was too short and because of that they rushed things: Important story elements like Dr. Mahnhattan's perception on time, Rorscach's back story (or any character back story, it is so important to the over riding theme of who superheroes really would be should they actually exist), why the alternate history really happened the way it did, and so on. I feel like it was a bit hard to follow for someone who never ever read the novel.<br/><br/>Also, there was some cheesy dialog with some surface acting, but it is forgivable I suppose.<br/><br/>It was beautifully shot, the crew was very creative and effective especially in the beginning. Soundtrack is wonderful. And there are other entertaining perks, like Silk Spectre whooping some ACE in prison dressed up in a skin tight outfit, lots of Sin City/300esque violence, and others.<br/><br/>In short, I feel like the biggest fault of this movie was that they had to make it short, and at nearly three hours that is saying something about the original work's depth, and dumbed it down for the general audience. Oh well what can you expect? They have to make money somehow, and that they did."
"marzzmanton","8","1","6","9 March 2009"," Rorschach shines, even more than Dr. Manhattan
","I am one of the crowd that has not read the comic, being born in '85. The movie however has made me read it, I just had to. Why? Because throughout the entire movie you are looking at an awe-inspiring character study. Each character has so many information surrounding him, past and present - you can completely understand why they act the way they do. You feel their motives, you can start predicting ... like when Rorschach takes a quiet step into the hospital toilets.<br/><br/>After now having read the comic, which I can only recommend, Zack has had to deal with days of information - only to place it in a 160 minute film; with great result! Yet there is more if you crave it. There are very interesting supporting character stories in the comic, like that of the psychiatrist that tries to analyze - even cure - Rorschach. Rorschach himself made the movie for me and my friends, which he of course was intended to, defiant in all odds. And although bitter and black to the core, a good and even rightful man. Jackie Earle Haley, you were awesome.<br/><br/>The Watchmen their original goal might have been fulfilled at the end, but the question is at what price and on which foundation. You will find yourself pondering the final fate of several characters and their impacts on human future society as depicted in the film. Morality, peace, sacrifice and honor are all themes that are somewhat torn here. It has been said many times that a great movie keeps you pondering for a day, this movie has kept me puzzling for over two.<br/><br/>Never back down, not even in the face of Armageddon."
"bobinson_mcloeb","9","1","6","9 March 2009"," Don't expect a direct transfer from page to film and you'll be as pleased as I was
","I'm a fan of the graphic novel. Actually, I'm more than a fan of the graphic novel, I've read it about 15 times. I've got a real deep rooted foothold into the world of Watchmen, and into its story and mythology...<br/><br/>So it was with an anxious sense of doubt that I watched this movie. Now, I went in fearing the worst, I thought it would've been a butchering of the source material. A real bad quick over with the story and added fight scenes to keep the laymen interested. Something that didn't even skim the surface of what the graphic novel really was...<br/><br/>It was these expectations that were shattered. More moments than I can count were seemingly taken straight from the pages and placed on screen, with real actors in the place of the drawn caricatures that I'm so used to seeing. Moments where things were filmed in such a way that I gasped or chuckled when I saw how they were taken straight from the comic and slapped onto the screen.<br/><br/>However I also knew that when the medium changes, so does the message. Something is always lost in the translation. From film to the page, from the page to film, it doesn't matter, somethings just naturally work better or worse with each medium, and it was at this point in mind where I walked away satisfied with what Zack Snyder accomplished. Those who expected the EXACT story, word for word, action for action portrayed exactly on film as it was on the page were setting lofty goals from the beginning. What's the point in having Dr. Manhattan teleport everyone from the studio to the parking lot, then teleport himself to the old bar in the Gila flats to get the picture before going on to mars? When you can save a few minutes on screen (and a few hundred thousand dollars in SFX), by having Dr. Manhattan carry the picture of himself with Janey to the T.V. interview, and then just teleport himself straight to Mars from there? What's the harm in that? Whats the harm in changing things around a little just to aid in story development on screen? Most of the changes I saw in the film were made to do just that.<br/><br/>But alas... some people set themselves up to be disappointed right from the start. Lofty expectations create a long fall to reality I'm afraid. Understanding that not everything in the graphic novel can be portrayed on film is a good place to start for fans of the graphic novel right at the beginning. It is with this in mind that you walk out of the theater in awe as to how much the film makers took straight from the text. It's truly remarkable... who cares with the ending varies from the comic to the film? The film ending works better for the film anyways, and fits in very nicely.<br/><br/>The only point of contention I had with the film was the over the top violence. Now, with some characters it actually fit. Both Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan in the source material have skewed morals and have lost touch with what is humanly acceptable. When these two characters are on screen and are the source of the over the top violence, it just fits. However, when it was Dan and Laurie involved in the violence it just didn't seem to work. Both have different sets of morals and different principals than Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan.<br/><br/>I loved the casting. Dan and Dr. Manhattan were perfectly cast. Billy Crudup was spot on with Dr. Manhattan. Jackie Earle Haley couldn't have done a better job. His running dialog in the film is exactly as I imagined it when I first read the source material. The casting on the whole was very good. Even Matthew Goode was a real good choice for Ozymandias, even though I was worried he might be a little too small looking for the role.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very pleased with the final product. Well done Zack... Well done."
"liberalgems","5","1","6","8 March 2009"," A Sobering Story About The Stupidity of the Human Race!
","This story was written back in the 1980's when the Cold War was still unfolding. Those who are too young to remember the fear of nuclear war and that the Commies would someday be knocking on our doors -are lucky! It's sad to say, but ALL wars from the Korean to Vietnam, and every other war American's funded throughout the world - in mostly poor, Third World nations - were all caused by the never ending Cold War! Keep in mind these numerous wars cost millions of lives and many billions of dollars! Watchmen, while a fantasy, is certainly realistic when it comes to the fear many people around the world felt. (And, this is an era, which should be carefully studied by every student in the United States before graduating high school, but I digress....) <br/><br/>In Watchmen there are very few good guys! The violence is so gruesome at times I had to repeatedly cover my eyes! And I'm in my 40's! I WANT TO WARN PARENTS THIS FILM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG TEENS! If the gruesome scenes of violence don't disturb them, they need to get some help! While the Watchmen is a fantasy/science fiction/drama/chick flick -it's also a horror film! This is NOT some cutesy Super Hero story! <br/><br/>Watchmen is an important film, which will soon be forgotten because of the extreme violence and, at the same time, for it's deep political message. This is also an anti-Republican and anti-conservative film -as blatantly political as you can get! This is the part of the story I love! While Richard Nixon and the toady Henry Kissinger were no dummies by any stretch of the imagination, they both were accurately portrayed as morally bankrupt and plain crazy! But the bottom line here is that the majority of voting American vote these monsters into office and then collectively shrug their shoulders when rotten things happen! To say that the Watchmen is a sobering story about the sheer stupidity of the human race in general - and the American people, specifically, is an understatement!"
"mattwaterhouse","10","1","6","8 March 2009"," Very well done
","It is very rare that a movie seems to be made especially for me, but this was. I have tried my best not to let that effect my evaluation of this film.<br/><br/>It is 1985, and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. Watchmen begins with the murder of former masked hero The Comedian. The near insane vigilante Rorschach investigates the murder, and begins to uncover a much more sinister plot, whilst trying to convince his former allies that they are in danger.<br/><br/>This film won't do as well as it could at the box office because of it's 18 (R) rating, and by toning down the gore it could have gotten away with a lower rating and pulled in more of a teenage audience. However its maturity works well and this is the first real attempt to explore the darker side of masked heroes. The graphic novel is a fantastic piece of literature and in my opinion it has been adapted very well by Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>The run time for this is just over two and a half hours, and I didn't feel it, which for me is a first. It kept me gripped throughout and I liked the way the film looked; the cinematography was incredible. In terms of performance, the cast pretty much delivered on all fronts. I found Malin Ackerman a little too one note, but that aside the casting was fantastic. Jackie Earl Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan were mesmerising as Rorschach and The Comedian respectively, whilst Patrick Wilson and Matthew Goode gave good performances and Nite Owl II and Veidt. Billy Crudup gave a very interesting take on Dr Manhattan, one of the highlights of the film was the exploration of his back story. Indeed, the exploration of the characters' pasts was where the film really excelled, in particular those of Rorschach and The Comedian. The ending, which has been changed from the graphic novel, has divided audiences. I feel that it was a solid adaption which brought a lot out of the characters and brought the film to a satisfying climax.<br/><br/>The only things I would have changed were the second to last scene, which was pointless, and the score. Aside from the opening credits where Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A'Changin'"" was played, the song choices were clumsy and failed to add to the atmosphere. An orchestral score would have been far superior. Also, I would have liked to see more of Moloch.<br/><br/>This is a film to watch at the cinema, so far it is the best film to come out this year."
"icantplaygolf15","9","1","6","8 March 2009"," An incredible adaptation to an often labeled ""unfilmable"" novel.
","The rule of thumb when it comes to books and movies is that the source material will almost always dominate its film adaptation counterpart. This is why I chose to go into this film somewhat blind and reserve reading the praised Watchmen graphic novel from Alan Moore. Whether it's seeing a naked blue guy, Nixon's big nose, a prolonged sex scene, or some campy fun sequences, Zack Snyder's Watchmen film has garnered a lot of mixed feelings from the movie world. It's a near three hour superhero epic and I could only imagine how much more was embedded in the graphic novel.<br/><br/>The film unfolds with the death of the Comedian, with his retired superhero partner Rorshach investigating the aftermath of the terrible tragedy. He begins to suspect a plot to kill off all superhero vigilantes, or in other words, the Watchmen team themselves. Utilizing flashbacks and origin stories while simultaneously interweaving the significance of the Comedian's death is why Snyder manages to succeed. Each character gets his or her time to shine and we begin to slowly realize why they're doing what they're doing, and the deep faults with each individual who hides behind their dark and mysterious mask.<br/><br/>Another shining aspect here is Snyder's ability as a filmmaker to capture this alternate 1985 time setting perfectly. He grinds this fable in reality, and really gives you a clear picture on what the world would be like if their were superheroes bringing ""justice"" to the world. By far the most interesting of the ensemble cast of masked vigilantes was Rorsach, with Dr. Manhattan being a close second. For a mini review it's impossible to fully dive into their respected character depths but they're the two most intriguing characters. Nite Owl II is the most identifiable character and Silk Spectre II is probably the least likable but not a character to hate in the least.<br/><br/>The performances are stellar, highlighting Crudup and Earle Haley as Dr. Manhattan and Rorsach respectably. Jeffery Dean Morgan as the Comedian is pitch perfect, capturing the dark and comedic character behind what is a troubled and morally confused superhero. In fact, most of these superheroes are confused. Watchmen is as much a superhero tragedy as it is a human one. Humans kill each other everyday, and for what? They ask to be saved, you do it, and their are still many that will hate you. The Watchmen hide behind their masks not only to cover their identities, but to hide their most embarrassing characteristic..being human."
"come2whereimfrom","8","1","6","8 March 2009"," Brilliant, but can't wait for the extended cut.
","There are lots of things I could tell you that you probably already know about 'Watchmen' like how it has taken the apparently un-filmable graphic novel over 15 years to reach the big screen and has in the past been linked to directors such as Gilliam and Greengrass to name but two. I could tell you how director Zack '300' Snyder wanted this to be over four hours long (roll on the extended version) or how writer Alan Moore isn't credited due to his longstanding fallout with Hollywood and their butchering of his work. So it is with trepidation that I go to see what turns out to be the first great film of the year. Forget the Dark Knight this is much darker, this is everything that Batman wanted to be but failed to live up to. It's grown-up, violent, philosophical, visually stunning and apart from the end almost entirely faithful to the subject matter in question. Firstly if you haven't read the graphic novel I suggest at some point that you do and revel in its many layers and subtexts, it truly is a great work. So too is the film, a thinking mans superhero movie, it's deep, disturbing but utterly engaging from start to finish. Set in 1985 with Nixon in power the cold war is at a critical point and the doomsday clock is set at four minutes to twelve, a retired superhero is murdered which becomes the catalyst for the rest of the films events and lead by the pushy psychopath Rorschach the Watchmen must reform to save the world. Without giving too much away Watchmen is an intelligent and visceral experience that stays with you long after the credits have rolled. It is stylised but not overly, the soundtrack is used well and the effects are breathtaking. The cast of relatively unknowns handle their parts well but its Snyder, his vision and attention to detail that should be rewarded, it's a testament that it has ever seen the light of day never mind being so good, so any minor flaws can, for now, be overlooked. So sit back, switch on and enjoy the spectacle of what most will regard now and in years to come as a clear leader in its genre."
"pinkliz41","10","1","6","8 March 2009"," An excellent film. Snyder has redefined the way we look at movies............... forever
","Watchmen is an exceptionally well made film that sheds new light and brings larger depths to character and story like never before. I mean the sincere amount of detail spread over each character is mesmerising. To add to this, the story also adds a more expansive and thoughtful depth as well. It not only makes you think, but is completely exciting as well.<br/><br/>The characters each have their own unique emotions that make you actually care for them. Snyder has particularly done this aspect very well. The violence is, brutal and exceedingly violent to any age of person. There's heads being cut into by meat cleavers, bones being snapped out, arms being cut off and so on. To all the previous reviews saying that Watchmen is boring and is really slow, don't listen to them. The story flows consistently and doesn't feel boring or lacking at any time, and the help of flashbacks also add a greater excitement and adventure to this piece of movie excellence.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a master piece and should be re-watched year after year by anyone who loves film and who wants to watch a detailed and exciting action thriller."
"amunetpallaton","9","1","6","8 March 2009"," Awesome movie!
","Let me first start off by saying that I never read the graphic novel. I might pick it up in the future though. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a bit confusing at first... what was going on and what date the movie is set in, but that's cleared up after a while... and even then it doesn't really matter b/c the movie just draws you in. The FX in some spots was a bit cheesy, but overall... just a very cool movie with great characters and a decent story.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see heroes who weren't spewing out rainbows all the time. Who are actually human, not perfect, and have dark, very dark sides. Sure Batman goes in to that, but not like this movie did. It makes Batman look like an emo poser wannabe.<br/><br/>Just be warned parents... this movie is rated the way it is for a reason. Do not think for a moment that just b/c it's from a ""comic"" that it is kid friendly. There is nudity and there is graphic violence. Everything a girl like me would want heh."

","I had thought that ""The Watchmen"" was too dense, too many levels of access and attention, to bring to the screen. I wasn't right, I just wasn't wrong on how much could be brought to bear.<br/><br/>I've been an avid fan of the masterful work of Alan Moore in multiple works, almost all of which have failed to be brought forth to a large audience in cinema. This time, I think that Zack Snyder has brought to us as close to the live action that is possible. I would like to examine the basic flaws that exist in the film, but I think that is unfair to the strength exhibited in staying devout to the material provided. Zack had done this before in ""300"" to enjoyable man-moment results, but hits a very different layer of humanitythe one that Moore was reachingin ""Watchmen"".<br/><br/>The basic problem of perspective is a very easy thing for a director to ignore, however, Snyder revels in the basic point of Moore's work and it does not falter. While it is diluted for general audience access, there is the thread of perspective throughout the film. An impressive move and perhaps avad guard for an American film, hearkening to ""Rashamon"" vector of story telling. But that make it more or Moore's story than anything else, thus more the enjoyable for fan and novice alike.<br/><br/>An equally elegant, but abrupt change is made for the fandom on the ending, but I think it makes the story far more plausible at every level.<br/><br/>ZackI look forward to the ""Black Freighter"" and the 'must have' extras that you couldn't build. You've rationally filmed the unfilamable."
"fivesaints","10","1","6","7 March 2009"," Pure Cinematography!!
","This movie proves what a superhero movie can and should be. First off,the movie was great! I saw this opening night and the visuals and amount of complex details is almost too much to take in. The depth in this movie is like the clock that is referred to in it and all of its components perfectly work together to run a masterpiece. Watchmen couples great acting with spectacular effects and visuals with stellar cinematography to baffle any movie goer in amazement. For people who are in to quick action flicks or people who are prepared to see hell boy with cute little jokes while tackling a basic storyline, do not see this movie. This is not a flick to be taken as one or to be rated as one. It is an emotional drama/graphic masterpiece that is based on a quite unusual and amazing graphic novel. Another thing I would have to comment on is the amount of character detail and character development throughout the movie nicely done by the director. Even Eddie Blake is created to be a chip of pure evil and good and its hard for you to really tell if you want him to have died or find the goodness in his heart through accounts of brutal rape and murder. The complex character creation was done perfectly well with the symmetry of the plot line. All background detail was covered to make this movie very spectacular. This movie should be the forefront and the dark knight, in my opinion, of how superhero movies should be shot. Too many directors are focused on the quick action sequences and effects without tackling major lack in story depth, character, and acting. These points are perfectly addressed in Watchmen and I would recommend it to anyone willing to enjoy a treat to the naked eye :)"

","This is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it...Well, i loved it. Maybe it is because i had already read the graphic novel and my expectation for the movie was quite high. Mr Snyder met my expectation and most probably many more who had read the awesome graphic novel.<br/><br/>Mr Snyder tried to do a scene by scene adaption of the graphic novel and he nearly did that to perfection (perfecting it is impossible) without leaving anything important.Mr Snyder had to get the cast right and he did just that(with the exception of Mathew Goode as Ozymandias).<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Hayley steals the show as Walter Kovacs AKA Rorschach. He suits the character perfectly, from his nasal voice (unlike Cristian Bale's Batman) to his dazed look as Walter Kovacs and mannnerism of Rorschach. His voice over from reading Rorschach journal was what people imagine when they read the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Billy Crudup as Dr Manhattan...well he did not need to do much because Dr Manhattan is somewhat close to an alien than a human. I usually tend to imagine Keanu Reeves as Dr Manhattan as it would suit hiim perfectly. The manner he speaks and move is what Keanu would be good at.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson is another perfect fit as Dan Dreiberg AKA Nite Owl II. He got the side parting hair on him and those big glasses which gave him the nerdy look that is required. He acted as the kind hearted guy who deep down inside misses the vigilante days after retiring from it.<br/><br/>Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II...well she is hot and that is what most fanboys wanted to see. Enough said.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Dean Morgan did not have as much screen time being The Comedian but he did the best with the screen time he gets. Being the scumbag in the movie and got killed at the start of that gave the setting to the whole movie. The Comedian gave two hoots about who he offends or whatever decision he made, whether it's wrong or right and Jeffrey did just that to the character.<br/><br/>Matthew Goode as Adrien Veidt AKA Ozymandias...Well he just doesn't fit, from his frame to his hair and the way that he talks.

"Apemangalore","8","1","6","7 March 2009"," The second fine film of '09
","While I was pretty excited going into Watchmen, one of my biggest fears was that the film would only cater to fans of the graphic novel. However, as one of the uninitiated, I can safely say that Zack Snyder's latest does not disappoint. First of all, I found the action/combat sequences in Watchmen to be some of the best that I've seen in any comic book movie. Many have complained about the film's use of slow-motion, but it really never bothered me here. As I've said before, it's definitely preferable to the fast, close-up quick cuts used in many action sequences nowadays (most notably those found in Batman Begins). Now, it did get on my nerves a bit when it was used in 300, but somehow, it manages to work perfectly in Watchmen. Beautiful in both choreography and shooting, the film gives the audience clear shots of every bit of the action.<br/><br/>As far as the acting is concerned, Watchmen delivers for the most part. However, one of the cast members that's been receiving a lot of negativity already has been Malin Akerman as Silk Specter II. While I didn't think that she did a great job, she certainly wasn't horrible; her performance was what I'd call decent.<br/><br/>Now, Jackie Earle Haley, on the other hand, does an absolutely incredible job as Rorschach, creating what I think is one of the coolest comic book film characters ever. His desire to enforce justice grounds his loose grip on sanity, and has his past is explored throughout the film, we begin to understand how and why he snapped. Two other performances that I really enjoyed were those of Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, and Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, whose character is no less complex than Rorschach's. His observations of the crumbling world help set the context of the film's beautifully executed story. Patrick Wilson also does a fine job as Nite Owl II, although Matthew Goode felt a bit miscast as Ozymandias.<br/><br/>When you get down to it, Watchmen is about the mystery behind who is killing off the heroes. The movie got me caught up in this whole pursuit, and it was one of those few times when, throughout almost the entire duration of the film, I was literally on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Overall, Watchmen is a thoroughly entertaining film with complex characters, a compelling story, and some of the best action sequences that I've seen from any comic book movie. There are a couple of issues that I have in terms of casting, but nothing too major. Go out and see it."
"wgeddings","10","1","6","6 March 2009"," Great work and fast pace but be prepared to be unsure
","I am a sci-fi geek but never read the Watchmen graphic novel (GN) until I saw the trailer at the start of Dark Knight. I read a summary of the GN on wikipedia so I had a general idea what was going to happen and when I did read the GN, that foreknowledge made the GN even better, in my opinion. I remember at various chapters, I would pause and just have to ""digest"" what I had read and the thoughts, ideas and concepts it involved. Especially thoughts of what makes a hero and what makes a villain. My point is that at the end of the GN, I knew I liked it but it would take a bit of pondering to really fully enjoy the experience of reading it. That is a rare and good feeling I think.<br/><br/>The movie delivers that same feeling. Having read the GN, I knew what was coming, who various characters were, who would do what and it really did not lessen my enjoyment of the movie. I was amazed and impressed at how true to the GN the movie was. Everything is not exact but many minor differences are perfectly fine and fit the overall theme of the movie. Many other things are part of deleted scenes or stuff involving the ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" comic which eventually will all be on a DVD in an ultimate cut that will last almost 3.5 hours. I was fine with that and the movie did not suffer with those elements deleted. It will be a great movie with them too but I understood the need for some deletions and agree with what was shown. After the movie, some applauded but many, like me, were quiet. Just as when I finished the GN, I knew I liked it but I also knew I would have to digest it a bit. I look forward to that.<br/><br/>My son was with me and he had not read the GN so I was anxious to discuss many parts of it with him to see if he was confused. He said he liked it and in our discussions, it was obvious he followed the movie and the moral dilemmas it raises. The 2.6 hours passes very quickly.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine any better adaptation of the GN. The casting was great but I agree with many other comments about the poor music in the film. Sometimes, it really distracted. Worst of all, the Smashing Pumpkins song ""Beginning is the end of the beginning"" that was so wonderful in the first trailer was not featured in the actual movie. I really missed that.<br/><br/>I strongly encourage you to see this movie, whether you have read spoilers, wikipedia, the graphic novel or have no idea what it is about. The best advice I can give though is to have someone with you because after it is over, you are going to want to discuss it to help you get your thoughts around some of the concepts."

","For the record I have never read the graphic novel. I enjoy well made movies much more than graphic novels. So I will focus on this film on its merits alone. The cinematography is nearly flawless, the sound effects are flawless, the CGI is incredible, the scripting and editing moved the story along rapidly and allowed the viewer to understand the complexities of the characters very well. All of the actors made their characters seem as though they might actually exist in our world. The score of the film matched the action on the screen to a tee. The songs set a tone for the era in which the film was set. The action was fast paced and exceedingly well choreographed. The atmosphere of the film was absolutely perfect for the dark tone of the story.<br/><br/>The best review I have read regarding this film was done by Roger Ebert so I heartily recommend readers to check it out. Any real fan of fantasy films would readily rate this a ten out of ten."
"neji107","8","1","6","6 March 2009"," Watchmen
","Let me say this before I begin. Alan Moore's graphic novel was monumental and spectacular. I am a fan of the graphic novel myself, so don't take me wrong when I say that I believed it was possible for Zach Snyder to overtake Alan Moore's original work. Now, did he? Not quite. Let's see why (this is intended for people who have previously read Watchmen) : <br/><br/>The Story- Oh, the plot. This is where fan boys and Watchmen geeks start feeling antsy. It's true that many small scenes and alternate story lines were removed in order to correctly adjust to the feel of the movie. The Tales of the Black Freighter, mainly, was the most unfortunate loss in this process, but with a movie length already in arm's reach of three hours, it's understandable why this aspect of Watchmen was taken out. Besides, it will be featured on a spin-off DVD. Aside from that, the details from that book that were removed were, in retrospect, too minor to cause a significant disturbance to the movie. There simply isn't enough lost content for fan boys to be up in arms. So yes, I'll say it: Snyder removed what he deemed was ""unnecessary"" to the core of the plot, and he pulled it off! In fact, while I was watching the film I hardly noticed the deleted content at all. It was only until I began pondering the movie after I had seen it when I realized that certain scenes had been left out at all. The movie was so intensely captivating that the thought never crossed my mind the whole while that my eyes were glued to the screen. It's amazing how much of the film ended up looking exactly alike to the novel. The ending, however, had some major revisions! Oh, the HORROR! Come on. They took out the giant, psychic, alien squid. Big deal. Can you honestly say that after reading the graphic novel ending, you weren't thinking, ""What the hell? Really?"" Eventually, the idea of alien squids settled in our minds, and we convinced ourselves that it created a satisfactory ending. Well, guess what? You can still achieve the same effect with the ending Snyder concocted. The idea of using Dr. Manhattan's power instead of alien squids is a bit less far-fetched and much more comforting to our common sense. Honestly, it's not as major a change as critics make it out to be. Don't call me a heretic, but I may just have liked Snyder's ending little more <br/><br/>The Characters/Actors- Well here's something I didn't expect. After being blown away by Heath Ledger's joker in Dark Knight, what can you expect from actors in a super hero movie? I didn't expect much from Matthew Goode or Malin Akerman. But I was wrong. Matthew Goode, though tweaking the appearance of the original Ozymandias, performed wonderfully. His acting was a bit out of place in a few scenes, but nothing that might make it anything worse than awkward. Goode's build may not match that of a ridiculously muscular superhuman, but it is not a noticeable of a defect. He was a little feminine though well, I won't go there. Crudup was fine, but his normal human voice was far too soft to personify an immortal like Dr. Manhattan. Oh, and thanks for the big, blue penis. Appreciate that. Very faithful to the novel. On a different note, Patrick Wilson and Haley were absolutely stunning; it's impossible to use words to describe how well they fit their characters, so I won't try. The only weakness, maybe, was Malin Akerman's performance. MAYBE. She exceeded my expectations, no doubt. She was good enough, but not great. The Comedian was portrayed just as well as anyone else by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Overall, it was a strong, well-put together cast. Oh, and Nixon's ridiculously enlarged nose was actually accurate, just in case you were wondering<br/><br/>Visual Effects- Damn. I mean, how do you top the stuff Snyder throws at his audience, especially with the budget he had? Effects were simply spectacular; no doubt about it. This is perhaps the strongest aspect of the movie. I expected nothing less (however, I did cringe slightly in a couple scenes involving Archy and Dr. Manhattan, in which the CGI did not seem very realistic). GORE! Be forewarned! BLOOD, GUTS, GORE! There, I warned you. Aside from the occasional glowing penis, the most shocking parts came from the most satisfyingly violent scenes. The fighting was magnificent! Nostalgia took over during the hand-to-hand combat scenes as I was reminded of martial arts fights immortalized in The Matrix. Then fascination took over as I watched the scenes explode with action and enter a whole new level of awesomeness. <br/><br/>So, overall? I proudly award Watchmen with a well-deserved 9/10. For being an ""un-filmable"" graphic novel, Snyder certain created a good movie. I still am reeling over the entire thing. Whoa, what just happened!? Watchmen happened. Snyder, his cast, his crew, and all you loyal fans made it happen. They truly made the Watchmen come to life. Bravo! So next time you hear a grumpy critic rave about how Watchmen fell short or read a harsh criticism of the movie, you know they've caught Alan Moore-ism. Yes, with a nasty attitude like Alan Moore's that refuses to even give the Watchmen movie a chance to live up to the novel, it stands no chance in the mind of the public. While I respect Moore's point of view, I still disapprove of his intolerant attitude. Why is it impossible to create a film adaptation of a graphic novel and not miss out on the big picture? I believe once Watchmen spreads and grows exponentially in popularity, then the Alan Moore's of the world will truly be the ones missing out."
"raggoDW","10","1","6","6 March 2009"," Who watches the Watchmen? - I do, and I love it!
","As many have all ready said, this isn't the graphic novel, its the movie. Alan Moore himself says that his work wasn't meant for the big screen, it was written for comics, and thats why he disassociates himself with the medium - And it's true! The comic can't be put onto the big screen, it would be impossible. Small things had to be cut from the story, they had to be slightly revised, in order for it to work in a motion picture! And for all the people comparing it to the Dark Knight, the Dark Knight wasn't an adaption, it was a completely original story. And I'll say it again, comics don't work as films, thats why they're comics! A Watchmen movie could never do the comic justice, but it sure as hell has done itself justice.<br/><br/>Aaannyywaayy...I went to see the first showing at my local cinema, and there were around 20 people in that showing at the start, but by the end there were only 10. This is not a bad thing! - it proves how although they have had to make some compromises (how else would they make their money back?) they have stayed faithful to the source material and not completely butchered it. I'm already a fan of the comic, so you can't accuse me of not knowing it.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot with Snyders personal fanboy touch shining through. I would recommend reading the book first because you will appreciate the movie experience even more (unless you're the kind of person who tricks themselves into thinking they're a pretentious fanboy just because they've read it, whether they like it or not). The attention to detail is spot on, the film is chock-a-block with nice little touches that any normal trailer whore would turn a blind eye to. Casting is great, especially Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Matthew Goode is an interesting choice for Ozymandias, he didn't seem like the right one to me at first, but he grew on me. Patrick Wilson is fantastic as the loser of the heroes; Nite Owl (2nd gen). Billy Crudup pretty much captured the character of Dr. Manhattan, although you could say the visual effects team pretty much captured him. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was great as the Comedian. And Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre (also 2nd gen)...well...she was just kind of 'meh' - but considering that even in the comic shes a walking talking blasé cliché, it doesn't make that much of a difference.<br/><br/>All I can say is thank God that DC have the rights to the comic and not Moore himself, because if that grumpy old genius did we wouldn't have the Watchmen movie. Go watch it, you might like it, I certainly did."
"MovieManiacX","10","1","6","6 March 2009"," Watchmen Is No Longer Unfilmable!
","Watchmen was everything I had hoped for. It delivers a great story, interesting characters, top-notch special effects, gore, nudity, and a visual style that matches the graphic novel perfectly.<br/><br/>For starters, I have read the graphic novel and enjoyed it immensely. I was initially wary of the adaptation, but with the very competent Zack Snyder directing, I was sure that he would be able to deliver on his promise of a faithful adaptation. Boy did I hit the nail on the head! The story is multi-layered and involving, and has been adapted perfectly from the graphic novel. If you've read the novel, you won't be disappointed and if you haven't read the novel, you'll enjoy just as much (though you may not pick up on the subtle things included for the fans).<br/><br/>The characters are excellent and well-developed, something comic adaptations can fall short with. Each actor is superbly cast, especially Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Each plays their character exactly how I envisioned them from the graphic novel. Haley is particularly unsettling and extremely effective. Malin Akerman was wonderful too; she was not just eye candy. Everyone else does a great job, even the supporting actors. It was also nice to see very minor characters in the novel make an appearance in the film.<br/><br/>The special effects were downright amazing, especially Dr. Manhattan who looks completely real and not at all like a CGI piece of crap I feared he might turn out to be. I'm not sure how they shot it, but he looks great. Rorschach's mask was very cool as well. Its ever-changing patterns evoked a certain identification with the character's complex and disturbed mind. The scenes on Mars were great but the standout effect was Dr. Manhattan's disintegration and reformation - by far one of the coolest things I've seen in years! The film was also quite gory, especially when Dr. Manhattan explodes people from the inside. Let's just it's not for the kids! <br/><br/>The music was great too and utilized flawlessly. Some people thought it was inappropriate but I thought its use was more than justified in context. I loved the opening montage set to Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" and the use of Hendrix's ""All Along The Watchtower"" near the end. By the way, ""All Along The Watchtower"" is originally a Dylan song, in case you didn't know! <br/><br/>Lastly, Snyder did make some changes to the graphic novel, mainly for pacing and to help the cinematic transition. However, nothing that was left out felt missing. The ending is changed slightly, and if you've read the novel, you will most likely be perfectly fine with the change unless you are a die hard perfectionist. My friend thought that the ending change actually worked better than the novel's real ending.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: A satisfyingly well-done adaptation of Moore and Gibbons amazing graphic novel that delivers everything one could want and more! A+"

"simpsjd","9","1","6","6 March 2009"," For any purists out there, do me a favor and take a pill, preferably one from Adrian!
","The Watchmen should not leave anyone wanting, for anything from a motion picture, this film made it fun to go to the theatre and experience brilliant direction from an incredible cast who was gifted with easily one of the best screen plays you could find. I am sure that reviews will reference the graphic novel (of which I have been a fan for more than 20 years), that is all well and good however it may lead some folks away from an exceptional movie going experience. Visually this film is breath taking, allowing a flawless representation of a true ""superhero"" along with a couple of trips to Mars and Antarctica. One significant sentiment within this film is the failure of the entire global system, not just abrasively showing the failings, but driving home the point that as a people we can no longer solve today's problems with today's thinking. Regardless of the topic be it politics, industrial economics, planet wide dependence on fossil fuels or the truth that man has by his how design destined to unravel all he has created barrage of imagery is laid before you in order to clearly illustrate each failing. Without question this is more than just an ""action"" or ""graphic novel"" movie, with layer upon layer of complexity that creates a reality so shocking, like a bad accident looking at first half turned away, then finding yourself fully engaged to a tale that will have you questioning what are the true costs of peace, more importantly would you be willing to make that sacrifice. Simply put, this is a film that should be taken seriously, and appreciated within a theatre where you are able to see and hear not only the motion picture but the audience reaction to this most invasive story."
"ZenShark","9","1","6","6 March 2009"," Go watch the watchmen!
","I'm a huge fan of the watchmen book, and was anxiously anticipating the movie. The fact that snyder was attached unnerved me a bit, and then the slo-mo in the trailers unnerved me a bit more. But despite all this, i was totally psyched to the film, even as my expectation weren't that high.<br/><br/>Review is in two parts, for the ones who have read the novel, and the ones who haven't.<br/><br/>If you've read the novel, you'll be surprised at how much snyder has managed to cram into the movie! Practically the entire book is in here, or at least referenced in some way. Every major scene from the novel is here. The cast is excellent in their respective roles, and the trailers don't do them justice. I thought the acting would be atrocious based on some pre-released sequences. But everyone was spot on, and captured the essence of their characters well. Even the much panned performance of malin akerman wasn't bad, and suited the character in the book.<br/><br/>People have been saying that the cinematography is insane etc., and to be honest, its not THAT insane, and thats a good thing. I was afraid the movie would lose the visual texture of the novel, but the fact is, the film captured that texture quite well. I think the editing has a lot to with that (ignoring the few bits of slo-mo, which i don't like, but weren't as distracting as one would expect).<br/><br/>What struck me was that the first hour and a half of the movie is an exact copy of the graphic novel! anything missed in those sequences is hard to tell because there is so much in there! The ending is different from the novel, and i was afraid it wouldn't work. But again, it works better than expected because there is some exposition through dialogue that makes sense of it. Why snyder changed the ending when he's insanely true in every other aspect is strange. But the meaning of the ending is preserved, and so the fans should be pleased. From my experience, even as i was miffed about the changed ending, by the time to get to the end of the film, you are so overwhelmed by all that has gone before, that you can only smile, and forgive snyder the lack of squid.<br/><br/>People who haven't read the book should be in for a surprise. This isn't superman, or avengers. It isn't the black and white world of the dark knight. This world has real people, with real issues. Issues that the movie isn't afraid to deal with, and in a way, is actually about. The issues with people in general as represented by society, and people in particular as represented by the characters.<br/><br/>As for the action, its refreshing. Every punch and kick looks (and sounds) like it really hurts...the use of slightly faster frame rates accentuates the impact of blows in a bone crunching fashion.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book, you'll also be surprised by how heavy the subject matter is, skirting through various themes flawlessly, and demanding your attention at every moment. This is a movie which will give you something to think about."
"TheHande","8","1","6","6 March 2009"," A mental exercise
","Watchmen is not like your typical comic-book movie. Rather than trying to tell a story, it's more of a speculative work that takes the form of a comic book and flips it into a twisted parody and a simultaneous mental exercise for the audience. It's parallels to other better known comics and their characters are perhaps pointless and it's hard to write a review of the film without attempting at least convey the philosophical edge this movie has over most of the competition.<br/><br/>One thing which shines through the adaptation of comic to film is that it feels almost like it's trying a little too hard to be a movie. The film suffers from being too wordy and not utilizing a movie format for it's deep philosophical probing of the human mind. It does get its commentary on nuclear warfare and humanity's inhumane nature across with the bluntness of a sledgehammer for which the film really can't be criticized since that is obviously the whole point of the movie.<br/><br/>The thing which Watchmen really needs and consequently lacks however is an interesting visual narrative. Things progress simply because they seem to need to do so and yet in such highly reality-based comic book setting the progress feels a little forced. Yet it feels like it drags on a bit, especially in the beginning, the problem may however be that the film simply doesn't confine to the basic structure of a movie and that's why it feels a little awkward. 90% of the whole movie is setup for a climax that isn't really all that climactic.<br/><br/>It's a little hard for me to put this movie in frank comparison with other Super Hero movies because it clearly plays with its own set of rules. Really all I can offer is my humble opinion, it's a good film with a deep psychological plot which none-the-less irks me in its attempts at being cinematic."
"SophomoreSlump","9","1","6","6 March 2009"," Watchmen Explores Humanity
","It is the year 1985. The Doomsday Clock is set at five minutes to midnight. America is at the brink of war with the Soviet Union, and the only thing standing between them is Dr. Manhattan who has the ability to control the physics around him. At the same time, a superhero-turned-vigilante, Rorschach discovered that one of his former colleagues was murdered. He investigate the case while trying to reach his other colleagues, Nite Owl II, Silk Spectre II, Ozymandias and Dr. Manhattan, fearing that they might be next. As he gets deeper to the truth, he discovers an even more disturbing conspiracy -- linking with their past and will bring devastating consequences for the future of not only them but the entire country  that has something to do with one of them.<br/><br/>I went into the theatre without knowing anything about the graphic novel. And guess what? I actually enjoyed it. It was really entertaining and the entire two plus hours seems to just fly by.<br/><br/>What really impressed me was the coherency of the movie. It starts off with The Comedian murdered, a tense Rorschach, and some other distressed member of the Watchmen. However, as the story progresses, we are given the entire back-story of each characters as the flashbacks and the present story lines intersect with each other. A masterful storytelling.<br/><br/>The special effect is spectacular. It's like we're transported into another reality; a whole new world right on screen.<br/><br/>But this is no 'The Dark Knight' though. It is dark but it has a lot of flaws. For instance, some might say that it follows the graphic novel too directly that it seems campy at some point. Even the sound effect for the punches is so unrealistic (""Swoosh...Dup...Dush!"").<br/><br/>What redeems this movie is the plot itself. It explores humanity. It raises questions such as: What would happen if a man is given unlimited knowledge but the most important parts of him is taken away such as his emotions and his humanity? How a woman actually forgives his attacker in an attempted rape and actually had an affair with him? How the people back then hated gays that they murdered a superhero for being homosexual? What would happen if a powerful man is given the choice between killing millions or let billions of people get killed? And so on. This is the kind of questions that makes watching Watchmen very interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, Watchmen is a very well-made movie. I recommend it for any comic book fans, action movie fans, or just any casual movie-goers. This is a must WATCH!"
"MissyH316","9","1","6","6 March 2009"," An Excellent Adaptation of the Seminal ""Cerebral"" Graphic Novel
","The packed-house midnight premiere audience I was in (amidst mostly 17- to 30-year-old fanboys) watched in reverent awe (with, of course, shouts of exclamation during the more shocking scenes) of what this ""fangirl"" calls one of the most well-done movie adaptations to film of ANY novel I've read to date. <br/><br/>Certainly no movie is perfect, but I'm not going to bother nit-picking here as I deeply feel Zack Snyder & Co. gave it their all to do proper and faithful justice to the original ""Watchman"" graphic novel - and for that they have my utmost respect and appreciation (are you listening, Joel Schumacher?). Another cast & crew may have done it differently and perhaps equally AS well, but I dare anyone else to try and do it better. I think Alan Moore's missing out... oh, well. <br/><br/>This is not going to be for everyone's taste, especially those who are expecting a smash-'em-up, explosive action film with well-known, mainstream superheroes. Oh, yes - there's literally some great ""bone-crunching"" action, sometimes quite disturbing, delivered with wicked intensity (and daresay occasionally a little amusement) by equal-opportunity butt-kickers. There are also some erotic scenes, and one main character is often nude (true to the original story). But what you have in total is a dark, epic emotional story of powerful but disenchanted protagonists who are still trying to do the right thing for their fellow Americans - at least in their own eyes.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with ""Watchmen"": before you see the film I'd recommend you either just familiarize yourself a little bit with its basic plot and characters, or at least go in with an open mind and no preconceived notions. Its ""R"" rating is well-deserved; ""Watchmen"" is no children's tale. But to me, all of the more ""adult"" aspects of the story were handled within good context of the characters and the storyline, not with immature, gratuitous excess for shock value alone. <br/><br/>My recommendation: go see this intriguing, intelligent, dark and disturbing story of fallible superheroes versus the world. Fans, if nothing else I think you'll appreciate the filmmakers' efforts to stay respectfully true to the original story - others, expect the unexpected and enjoy the ride. :-)"
"otorrinolaringologista","10","1","6","6 March 2009"," One of the great attempt into comic adaptation of all time
","I will try and express myself as before watching the film, off course i was afraid of this. It was like the speeding train everyone said it was impossible to catch. The Watchmen graphic Novel was one of the greatest materials into the (anti)super hero genre. It was a massive dissertation about power and human relations, if only one could see behind the cape, behind those common people, into their past...<br/><br/>I was worried when i read that David Goyer was once (for briefly moments) involved in the project, at that time Watchmen had already almost a decade of failed attempts into the celluloid screen and for sure was to be a «who dun nit» about who killed the comedian. <br/><br/>This film is about that and much more, i am actually not saying it was the best genre film of all time, but for the massive scale of plots and sub plots, i as a fan and a film-geek give it a 9 for «effort». I should be mad because of all the squidless scenes removed, i should be mad because of all those changes made, some of my favorite one liners were actually removed from the film, ahh, that vigorous «I Did it!» was one. <br/><br/>But immediately stroke me that this film is very far apart from the comic. i know for sure Alan Moore would enjoy this piece if he wasn't involved in the process. But its from another dimension as the comic was to be another sub reality of the 80s, this film is another reality apart also from the comic. It is not he comic, try and forget it for a moment!<br/><br/>I believe non fans would enjoy it except the one expecting to see a super hero movie, these will be utterly disappointed for almost 3 hours of massive information (oh yeah, if you are an active viewer prepare to absorb and digest long after the movie).<br/><br/>I can only say there were some plot holes (but nothing the director's cut wouldn't fix) and a very inconsistent art direction(Nixon nose is on my eye). the acting is much better than i would presume by the trailers, which is crucial. If you want to see one of those rare events (the ones that or you hate it or love it) like misunderstood films as blade runner or Brazil i think you will give credit on watchmen, Watchmen is no Hollywood film, it is a unique experience, go see it if you can handle the pressure."

"sjp15991","7","1","7","13 September 2011"," Mediocre cast but still a good film
","Being a big fan of Watchmen (the graphic novel) that is i was excited about this film finally being made. Then i looked at the cast list and was like ""Who?"". I'd heard good things about Jackie Earle Haley and had seen Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Who i personally think looks like a cheap Javier Bardem) in one episode of Greys Anatomy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately when watching the film i wasn't quite as thrilled as i was when reading the book and i think again the cast was a big part of this. While most comic book movies rely on their special effects and eccentric characters, Watchmen had attracted me because of its focus on morality and the deep characters (much more to them than your average comic book hero). Matthew Goode provided just the right amount of arrogance and slight homosexuality throughout but the real scenes where his character has an opportunity for complex emotion he seems rigid and uncompromising (may have been on purpose but i doubt it). Patrick Wilson was neither good or bad just perfectly mediocre and to be fair to Wilson the character doesn't provide much opportunity to flex his acting muscle. Malin Akerman is again mediocre and comes of as rather immature. Billy Crudup is good as the pre-transformation Dr.Manhattan but the coldness and robotic nature of the character don't allow him to act much. Lastly Jackie Earle Haley was amazing as Rorschach. When i first saw pictures of Haley i was worried he wouldn't sport the fiery red hair of Rorschach but he does and in every seen he is perfectly chaotic, psychotic and soulless. The performance itself will see Jackie Earle Haley play many mentally damaged and unstable characters in the future (e.g. Shutter Island) and was truly perfect especially in the scene where we first see him unmasked (trying to avoid spoilers) and he screams ""Give me back my face!"".<br/><br/>I would also like to add that while i love many of the songs used in this film that the music was poorly placed into scenes and often doesn't add to it e.g the ""99 Red Balloons"" scene. The opening montage with ""The Times they are a changin'"" by Bob Dylan is however exquisite and a great prologue to the film.<br/><br/>The special effects were good and were a big part in the massive budget for the film but i think Zach Snyder should have gone down a different route and focused on the acting and casting. I will say however that - like he does in 300 - Snyder immerses you in the Watchmen alternate 1985 world perfectly. The special effects, Snyders Immersion and Haley's performance make the film good but what could of been a great ensemble piece (Jude Law and John Cusack wanted to be in the film) is let down by a lack of stellar performances."

","I saw the trailer for this superhero movie in the cinema, I thought it looked really cool, I imagined it was going to be rather dark as well, but I also spotted how long it was, but I willing to sit through it, from director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead, 300). Basically this is set in an alternative America of 1985, where President Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden) has been reelected, John F. Kennedy (Brett Stimely) was not shot, the Americans won Vietnam, and there is another more significant Cold War, but more prominent are the costumed superheroes who exist in the world. While there is tension in the Soviet Union, and these superheroes are part of the fabric in the everyday world, masked vigilante Rorschach (A Nightmare on Elm Street's Jackie Earle Haley) is investigating a plot to kill and reveal identifies of many of these superheroes, many of whom are now retired. This includes the murder of Edward Blake aka The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who was planning to bring down the superhero group the Watchmen some time ago, so he tries to warn his former colleague. The fellow comrades include former partner Dan Dreiberg aka Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), the truly powerful Jon Osterman aka Dr. Manhattan (Big Fish's Billy Crudup), and Dr. Manhattan's lover Laurie Jupiter aka Silk Spectre II (The Heartbreak Kid's Malin Akerman). Throughout we see Dr. Manhattan trying to find some kind of resolution, the long retired and identified superhero Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) nearly assassinated, a framed murder by Edgar Jacobi aka Moloch the Mystic (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Matt Frewer), and of course the other heroes coming out of retirement. Dr. Manhattan is no longer interested in helping or spending time in humanity, Silk Spectre finds out she is the daughter of The Comedian and former Silk Spectre, Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino), Rorschach and Nite Owl II find out Veidt is responsible for everything. He explains the plan was to prevent a nuclear war between United States and the Soviet Union, but he did want to destroy the main cities, and the reactors are set in motion, Dr. Manhattan is seen as the main enemy, and Rorshach asks him to vapourise him, and Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre return to the ruins of New York City, being rebuilt to continue fighting crime. Also starring Stephen McHattie as Hollis Mason aka Nite Owl, Laura Mennell as Janey Slater and Rob LaBelle as Wally Weaver. I will be completely honest that I found it rather difficult to keep up with what was going on, it is quite hard to understand almost all the way through, also, I wasn't expecting a big blue bald muscular man to be naked a lot of the way through, you don't see many films with naked superheroes LOL. Putting aside the complicated plot, the dialogue is relatively cool, and the acting is alright, but of course the real star are the amazing special effects used to create the powers and look or Dr. Manhattan, and excite you with explosions and stuff, so overall, not a bad action fantasy thriller. Worth watching!"
"Strider_1978","9","1","7","28 March 2009"," Complex and political but certainly worth a 'Watch'
","It is hard for me to review this film. I am not a fan of the graphic novel and as such I have nothing by which to compare. All I can do here is sit and type thoughts based upon my viewing as a non affiliate.<br/><br/>I'm not going to bother with the story because it's already been explained and to be quite frank, politics aside I am still not entirely sure of the purpose or motivations of the group of Watchmen for which this film is so named.<br/><br/>What I do have to emphasise is that contrary to what the trailer might suggest, non affiliates can be forgiven for assuming that this is another super hero flick. The fact of the matter is that Dr. Manhatten aside, this is a group of costumed masked 'vigilantes' that exist to perhaps crime fight, perhaps fulfill their own political motives.<br/><br/>The interesting concept here is that Zack Snyder has given these individual enhanced 'Batman' esq abilities. They all seem to frequent the gym, each sporting respective black belts from which speedy and bone shattering skills emerge. Actually I'm lying, the most interesting concept is that none of these 'good guys?' are good. All seem to possess jaded and or selfish character traits. I might say that by far the most prominent character and scene stealer Rorshach is the exemption to this rule, but even him I would not care to meet in a dark alley.<br/><br/>In the first five minutes and opening credits we can see just what we are getting ourselves into. There is comic book brutality and adult, political themes that border on the satirical. This is a good thing, because this is the 'Q' for all the children in the theater who's parents assumed were sitting through an exciting super hero flick- to leave.<br/><br/>So now we know, or have an idea of things. Now, moving on to the next point I'd like to make. This film is not for the politically sensitive. There are images that might have open mouths and balled fists jabbing at the darkness. A graphic Kennedy assassination is one of these scenes that might serve up upset.<br/><br/>The film opens with the death of 'The Comedian' and then picks up with the resulting investigation and events that lead up to the eventual re-grouping of The Watchmen. Now I understand as a non affiliate how an intricate and complex graphic novel has been 'modulated' to the big screen here. Surely pages and character portrayals have been trimmed down and altered to fit a motion picture running time. That's OK, because though I found the plot to be heavy, I could discern sufficient within the given context presented how the world of The Watchmen was over and the political eighties climate was heated and somewhat revolutionary.<br/><br/>I believe where the film shines and perhaps entertains where lack of action or 'easy reading' keeps the popcorn munching is the art and cinematography. Sometimes we have to sit back and understand that much of it is theatrical satire and the somewhat 'forced' acting is in that very context. Nonethless I am happy that in place of a 'no brainer' we have a somewhat original dark sometimes noir adult film with strong characters that will intrigue if not 'entertain'. Not everything has to be understood completely. Here the characters and plot are defined enough that we can follow if we choose to. Somewhere along the lines Blade Runner meets 300 meets American Psycho with smatterings of something else that I can't put my finger on. To get to the point, I felt like I was viewing a movie in it's era without it being too theatrically obvious. I was able to suspend dis belief and live in that world for the duration of the film, and that is very important. <br/><br/>The adult nature is ever present, but I personally feel like it has been overly hyped as is always the case. Messaging boards were alive with 'blue penis' and pregnant lady getting shot. Well yes, it's all there but it's not as if it is all 'in your face'. The blue phallus is not an ever swinging 'horse' pendulum, it is present as part of the well sculptured statuesque Demi-God that is Dr. Manhattan. The pregnant woman is not executed with bloody violence. We see and hear the gunshot and we see her fall, but it's no Tarantino Kill Bill Bride. The 'porn' sequence is nothing more than what we see in '300', though perhaps a little out of place. It's two naked consenting adults, not an extreme close up of genitalia. Snyder is using these images to show us the weak and damaged and imperfect nature of the characters, specifically 'The Comedian'.<br/><br/>Essentially, I'll tie this up in a bow. First time viewers will not necessarily understand but will and might certainly appreciate and perhaps enjoy. It is aimed at a mature audience that are able to think, and not demand the blatant entertainment. Do yourself and others a favour, leave the kids at home."

","Watchmen: they say you either hate it or love it.<br/><br/>While not perfect, this film sits as its own standard. Although based on a graphic novel, this is not your typical family friendly Spidey-flick. <br/><br/>Whether you have read the graphic novel or not, consider this film on its own. It has a complicated plot, with flashbacks and back stories that interrupt the initial plot. But do not look at this as a bad thing. This film will make you think and pay attention. If you don't, prepare to be lost!<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal, of all the main characters. We learn the bloody creation of Rorschach, and the tragic installation of Dr. Manhattan. But, may I repeat, this is NOT the classic comic book film as Hollywood sees today!<br/><br/>This film was rated R in the United States for a reason: violence and sexual themes will exist. It is now the time for the mature film-goer to emerge. Put the blood spatters and glowing blue genitalia aside (as intended). There is an exceptional film beyond these.<br/><br/>Watchmen is by no means a perfect film; I have never seen one. However, Watchmen still blew me away.

"zombierob2458","10","1","7","9 March 2009"," Who Watches the Watchmen? I did and it's Great!
","Let me just start by saying I have long been a huge Watchmen fan. I think the only comic I would put ahead of it would be Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns. That being said I had lofty expectations of this film. So after seeing the film how did it fare? Well... it exceeded my wildest dreams. This film is amazing. It captures every rich detail of the comic. The political paranoia, the harsh violence, the love story, great action, the deep philosophical questioning of life in the universe and everything else Alan Moore painted into a rich literary masterpiece decades ago is all here. When I heard the cast so long ago not one actor, with the exception of Billy Crudup, excited me. After seeing the movie I can say this entire cast was phenomenal starting with Jackie Earle Haley who in every way WAS Rorschach and captured this role like i never could have imagined, Jeffrey Dean Morgan makes you actually feel for the loathsome comedian and Billy Crudup's detached Dr Manhattan struggling with emotion all the way to a strong performance by Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl. Even Mathew Goode, who at first seemed so miscast, really captured Ozymandias by the final chapter. The costumes and sets are great. The soundtrack fits well and sets the mood in each scene. The special effects, most notably Dr. Manhattan, are top notch. Zack Snyder's film really captures this ""unfilmable"" comic much as his take on 300 did. Even the ""new"" ending I can honestly say seemed to fit better than the original giant squid written by Moore. I know blasphemy right? well I stand by that remark it works the same yet feels less forced and random than the original. Comic films have grown up in the past few years and become not just great comic films but great films period. Like Dark knight this pushes the bar for the genre and brings credit to comic book based films. This is not Spider-man this is a dark, violent realistic film and it is a great one. Running about 2 hours and 40 minute this film never drags. I've actually read a director's cut may hit theaters this year(AWESOME). See this movie especially if you are a fan of the comic. Who watches the watchmen? Everyone should."
"Paul-Corio","10","1","7","7 March 2009"," A superbly judged and brilliantly executed screen adaptation
","Watchmen"" is set in an alternate 1985 America in which costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the ""Doomsday Clock"" - which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union - is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity... but who is watching the Watchmen? I am a big fan of the original graphic novel by Alan Moore which I first read when I was 11 and as a real movie geek and not someone who has been impressed with the recent 'super hero' adaptations, I thought I was going to end up disappointed or compromising my views over this movie as graphic novel adaptations normally lose a lot in translation to the big screen...not in the slightest! Gone is the teen angst of Spiderman, gone is the care free jauntiness of Fantastic 4, gone are spandex tights of Superman and gone is the self indulgence of X-Men. Watchmen is a grown up, complex and exhilarating fantasy film which stays very true to the graphic novel, however there are parts which have been shortened and adapted to the screen purely I suspect to stop the running time of the movie getting to the point where you'd have to take time off work to go and see it. A lot of the back story arcs, parallel stories and supplements from the graphic novel have been replaced by clever montages, references and flashbacks; enough to add to maintain the story without becoming confusing or overwhelming and certainly enough to keep the purists happy.<br/><br/>All in all the direction is slick and tight and you can tell that Director Zach Snyder who as well as having a well developed eye for visuals is obviously a fan of the graphic novel as he has decided to follow the story very faithfully and instead of changing it dramatically to suit a mainstream audience, has tweaked the story enough to keep the film flowing consistently and able to hold the attention of the audience throughout. Again purists will notice that the ending has been adapted slightly, but to be honest I'm of the opinion that it is the ending that should have appeared in the original graphic novel as I was never really taken with it myself (sorry Mr. Moore!). I have to take my hat off to the writers of the screenplay David Hayter and Alex Tse who have brought to life an inspired vision of an alternate world that echoes our own and made an exciting and intelligent adventure movie.<br/><br/>The characterisations are awesome, especially The Comedian and Rorschach where special nods must go to Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jackie Earl Haley respectively for their portrayal of these troubled and fatally flawed anti heroes and Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II is the stuff that boyhood fantasies are made of! Indeed the whole cast give great performances, attacking their roles with relish and really being able to get their teeth into what is an abundance of material to develop and play with, all of which really translates superbly to the screen.<br/><br/>Visually, Watchmen is an amazing movie just to look at as the scenery, customs and overall feel of the whole thing are just spectacular. The other thing that I applaud is that the movie doesn't pull any punches. There is a lot of graphic violence and overall the feeling of the film is pretty bleak and dark which again is true to the graphic novel. At times it's not always easy viewing and there are a few moments that will genuinely cause some to squirm in their seats, however this is part of the brilliance of Watchmen as It would have been so easy to play safe with some watered down PG friendly rating and lose the essence of the whole thing.<br/><br/>The end result is superbly balanced and an absolute masterstroke by Director Zach Snyder who has treated Watchmen with reverence and respect, choosing to concentrate on the story and characters first and to use the obvious strong aesthetic elements to cement the whole thing in place.<br/><br/>Admittedly for anyone who hasn't read the book, I'm not so sure how much of this is going to appeal to a mainstream audience as Watchmen is a deep and complex movie that should invite discussion and analysis; something that mainstream cinema so seldom seems to do these days. Also at nearly 3 hours long, this will be a big ask of some people.<br/><br/>I have waited 22 years to see Watchmen come to the big screen and I am so very pleased with the end result. I feel like I'm 11 again!"

On the other hand I feel that it was close to the comic. It did keep to the ideals and it was a reflection of the time that it was written in.<br/><br/>The casting and characters were fantastic especially the comedian, but i feel that some people who went for the action that they expected from this film may have been dismayed. There was action, but drawn out dramatic scenes outweighed the action scenes.<br/><br/>It was definitely a film worth watching and a much better remake than Alan Moore's other classic 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"".<br/><br/>Fans of the comic may enjoy it and if you are prepared for a long but impressive movie i recommend you see it."

"Dorkboss","4","1","8","8 November 2019"," Watchmen Without the Depth
","Watchmen is based on a graphic novel and it's written by the comic book legend Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbson. For 20 years, Watchmen has been going through constant development, Terry Gilliam himself who worked and failed to bring Watchmen to the big screen, claiming the novel to be unfilmable. Until Warner Bros gave the rights to Zack Snyder, after the studio became impressed with his work on 300.<br/><br/>The story takes place in 1985 when one of the old and crime-fighting member named ""The Comedian"" was murdered by an unknown killer; when another member of the team named ""Rorshach"" discover this, he warns them and tells them that it could be a killer who's plotting revenge against them. The remaining members of the group are Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, Dr. Manhattan, and Ozymandias.<br/><br/>Some of the cast did a alright job of their performance such as Jeffrey Dean Morgan as ""The Comedian"", Jackie Earle Haley as ""Rorshach"" I though the did a good betrayal of the character (even if he is edgy in this film), Patrick Wilson as ""Nite Owl"" was okay, and Billy Crudup as ""Dr. Manhattan"" which most found him boring, but to me, I felt that for the most part, it fits well to a character who's supposed to be stoic. Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre I felt her performance shallow and Matthew Goode as ""Ozymandias"" basically channeling his performance like Vincent Price.<br/><br/>The film has a dark, moody, & lofty weight to it that makes it feel unrealistic and the dialogue that is being used in the movie tends to sound like a speech rather than a conversation. The fight sequence that Snyder beings in the world of Watchmen are that not only do they know how to do kung-fu, but they also have super strength, mediocre CGI, bad aging makeup, and consent slow-motion that are being used without any epic weight that help carries the film.<br/><br/>Going through the whole movie (and yes I did watch the Director's Cut) I felt that the execution did not deliver the same way that the graphic novel did. I know that Snyder's plan was to make sure that the adoption stuck to the comic as possible. But even that can be the problem; because not only did Snyder represented Watchmen in this a hammy and pompous, but Snyder also doesn't get the idea of what Watchmen is about, actually bringing superheroes in the real world that has subversion and satire. So not only does the movie fail because it's inaccurate, it failed because it isolated the story of the novel and take off the depth that made the novel Watchmen so memorable back then and today."

","Yes this is yet another movie that was shot during a power-outage, we watched it on TV and were quite bored with the whole thing. Not only were we visually deprived but the storyline is convoluted and difficult to follow and seems to take you around in circles. The acting was competent and professional from what I could see, but with such low lighting little expression is visible, so I may as well have been listening to the radio. Not the usual run-of-the-mill super-hero film and does not come into the same class a Green Lantern, or Captain America. However if you view this movie as a piece of art then perhaps it works, I guess the proof of this would be how many people were in the audience as opposed to the very long list of credits."

Even if you hadn't read the graphic novel you can still follow the story. The music was extremely great and did its job by matching the feel and themes in the movie. Also, the music really gave the movie a good sense of time. Most of the songs are usually about the times that they were written in and i feel like even if the songs were written 20 years before the time setting of the movie, it still felt fresh, even in the alternate reality of Watchmen. This movie basically did for superhero movies, that Harakiri did for samurai movies. It was quite anti-super hero and anti-establishment.

"clouded_eye","9","1","8","6 March 2009"," Probably the Best Comic Adaptation to Date...
","Alan Moore can complain about this film's existence all he wants to... That doesn't change the fact that ""Watchmen"" is probably the best comic book adaptation to date... Actually, despite Moore's general complaints about the end results of previous adaptations of his work, most of them (""From Hell"", ""V for Vendetta"", and this film) have turned out very well. Only the horribly translated ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was truly a disappointment... Let's face it: when you're an acclaimed writer that Hollywood latches itself onto and they manage to score 75%, you're definitely beating the spread...<br/><br/>While it's true that Zack Snyder probably used ""300"" in the same way that Peter Jackson used ""The Frighteners"" and the dream sequences in ""Heavenly Creatures"" (i.e.: as practice for LOTR and to show he could pull it off), the end result is every bit as good as any of the films of Middle Earth...<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" is a brutal, no-holds-barred, and faithful retelling of what is probably one of the best graphic novels ever printed that manages to be a vast improvement over Snyder's last effort ""300"" by ditching the almost panel-by-panel-shot-for-shot literalism for something much more narrative and tangible in nature... People who have called the film ""confusing"" or the equivalent should probably all be taking Ritalin... If you actually pay attention, the plot is very easy to follow... People have also complained about a lack of character development when probably 45 minutes to an hour of the total 2 hour and 43 minute running time is spent in flashback, fleshing out the various characters' histories (just like the graphic novel... imagine that)...<br/><br/>Granted, this movie will mostly appeal to devout readers of Alan Moore, such as myself, but regardless, this is a great movie... It isn't Alan Moore's fault, Zack Snyder's fault or the fault of any of the actor's, producers, writers (or anyone else who worked on the film) if people don't ""get it"" because, as a species, our attention spans have been whittled down to next to zero... Yes, it's almost 3 hours long, but that time goes by at a reasonable rate... The pacing of the film is fine, the editing is well orchestrated and the special effects are superb...<br/><br/>I was a little hesitant (as I always am with comic adaptations) about the casting of the film, but the entire cast did a great job... The actors actually looked like the characters they were supposed to be playing (again, imagine that...)... I read one fan review where the author was complaining that Billy Crudup's performance was ""flat, detached, and emotionless""... uh... yeah.. That's Dr. Manhattan for you... d'oh...<br/><br/>Ignore the negativity... See this movie... It's far superior to the highly lauded (and unjustifiably so) ""The Dark Knight"" (which I gave 6/10)...<br/><br/>9/10..."

Everything from the costumes to the art direction to the inspired soundtrack just fits. The actors become the characters faithfully rather than shape them into something that would match their personality.

","Watchmen is one of the greatest novels I have ever read, certainly one of the greatest Graphic Novels in the history of the genre (personally, I think From Hell may have been the superior work by the author, but that's neither here nor there). From the moment I first read this inspired piece of literature, I imagined the Watchmen Movie. I heard the characters voices, Rorshach staring down the surrounding inmates at Sing-Sing prison, while declaring ""None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. You're all locked up in here with me!"" Dr. Manhattan monotonely asking Laurie Jupiter/Juspeczyk ""Why should I save a world I no longer have any stake in?"" Dan Dreiberg absent-mindedly reminiscing about past battles with ally Rorshach: ""Those were great times, huh Rorshach? Whatever happened to them"", and the simple and callous reply from his old friend as he walks away: ""You quit"".<br/><br/>I would hear these voices, but I resigned myself to the fact that Watchmen was, as Alan Moore has said, unfilmable. The superheroes are made up for this one particular story, based on golden and silver-age heroes that most of the Spider-Man/X-Men movie-going crowd has never heard of. The story is awash in brutality, sex, philosophy...and there is no catharsis; no simple solution to humanity's problems at the end. The real enemy is not a purse-snatch or a ""serial supervillian"" that can be defeated through superior fighting skill, but rather the ever-growing spectre of nuclear destruction. The enemy in Watchmen is the complete and utter destruction of the human race! What role can a costumed vigilante possibly play in such a scenario? And how can this be made into a live-action movie?!?! The brilliant Zack Snyder has answered these questions for me, and turned me into a lifelong fan and admirer for the faithful, classy, stylish, and overall brilliant way he has brought Watchmen to the movie screen. This is a movie with tons of heart, and you can feel the love in each and every scene. Snyder's passion for the source material is evident in each frame, each action scene, each line of dialogue. The characters sound like I imagined they would sound, and they look the way that Dave Gibbons drew them. From the god-like Dr. Manhattan, to the uncompromising (in every sense of the word) Rorshach, to the beautiful Silk Spectre, I may have never seen a truer translation of a graphic novel, at least not since Sin City.<br/><br/>Bravo and congratulations to Zack Snyder for not dumbing down a complex and sophisticated graphic novel to satisfy mainstream audiences. And though the ending, and the main villain's plan was slightly different than in the original graphic novel, the outcome and effect was the same.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This is the best that anyone could have possibly done in creating a Watchmen movie. I would not have changed a thing. Well, other than make the film run 5 hours. But that might be pushing it."

This is, without a doubt, the greatest opening credit sequence I've ever laid witness too. For about two-and-a-half minutes, we are slowly brought in beautiful fashion the past events of the Minutemen that have shaped the alternate universe in which Watchmen takes place in. It is just stunning.<br/><br/>You'd think that the film would kind of tail off after such an impactful opening with the Comedian and his assailant fighting, but you would be mistaken. The film, which has so much to cover, doesn't even begin to feel the slight-bit rushed until Dr. Manhattan teleports himself to Mars. This scene, Watchmaker, is still done brilliantly just the introduction is a bit rushed. It makes you wonder though, if Zack Snyder can deliver almost an hour of Watchmen without it feeling rushed in a two-hour and 40-minute movie, what will the 3+ hour Absolute Edition on DVD be like?<br/><br/>From Watchmaker on though, things get a little jumbled. They are still ridiculously faithful to the comic, just told in a different form, or done in a different way. It's clear here though, if you haven't read the graphic novel you may start getting a little lost or confused around this time. Things start to move fast, and it's clear the makers of the film weren't thinking of the mainstream audience in developing. As a huge fan of the comic, I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>This film stays faithful right up until the last bit. The new ending is a little too quick for my taste, and doesn't have near the impact that the GN's ending did. The ending is still done right, but it feels a little mashed. All in all though, it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>All the performances are astounding, even Matthew Goode, aside from the fact that they made him too sinister. Jackie Earle Haley and Billy Crudup give the best performances. JEH steals every scene as Rorschach, and gives you that sense of unease that the masked vigilante is supposed to. Crudup somehow captures the distant, and uncaring nature of Dr. Manhattan. It's eerie how good he is as the H-Bomb. Patrick Wilson is the perfect flabby failure of Nite Owl II, and Malin Akerman isn't just a sexy face to look at. She actually does a pretty damn good job as Silk Spectre II. And Jeffery Dean Morgan is fascinating as the sadistic, brutal, cynical Comedian. The biggest surprise for me though was Carla Gugino who did a great job as Sally Jupiter. Not to mention, she's an absolute fox in the Minutemen scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this is definitely the best adaptation Watchmen fans could have ever asked for out a theatrical cut. It has its bad moments, but in the end you realize that this was just a monumental achievement. A movie that was in development hell for 20 years has finally come to the big screen in gorgeous fashion."

","To be completely honest, I'm not much of a comic person. Although I love the idea of a hand done visual representation for a course of events, something about comics makes me feel like I'm missing out on the real experience of a great story. I admit I was apprehensive when I stepped into line to get into the theatre, worried that my expectations of a great graphic novel would be disappointed. When I leaned back in my chair at the theatre and the film began, I was absolutely spellbound. The effects, the costumes, blood, gore, and characters themselves were spot on. <br/><br/>The character I was most intrigued with was Rorschach, right off the bat. I felt that the scenes involving his flashbacks were, though disturbing, extremely inspiring. I felt like I knew everything about him. Effectively the movie slowly worked out each character's past, which was very satisfying at the end. <br/><br/>My one problem with the film was the attention to different characters side stories for certain amounts of time. An intense situation between two characters is suddenly shifted into another situation with two other characters. This scene then goes on for a little while and I completely forget about what was going on with the first two characters. It got a little confusing for me at some points. <br/><br/>I also didn't really understand the relationships between a few characters. It was the slight shift in costume that threw me off for some of them. <br/><br/>Overall, the film really struck a chord with me. I'm not too familiar with the graphic novel myself, and despite my doubts I really was blown away. I was very pleased with the amount of gore; not too over the top, and very convincing. The characters and costumes were fantastic and the story was great. I felt like I knew the story enough from the film alone."

","Go read the graphic novel. The graphic novel is beyond amazing. This movie adds nothing to it, it only takes away. Completely un-imaginative, every frame of the movie is straight from the comic book. Normally this would be a good thing, but not when you do it with a complete lack of your own creativity. The only really good things were the cast and effects, but the director's idea of what the movie was about doomed it's existence from conception. He thought that the ENTIRE story was about the guy getting away with killing all those people. Really? The message is clearly stamped on every page of the graphic novel. How could you miss it and think that the story was about something as obscure as that? Zack Snyder, you did an exceptional job on 300, but tell you what, take that annoying lisp of yours, shove it up your butt, fart, and then write a script about that. It'll probably turn out better and it's not as easy to miss the point of the story. Even if that were all good, this movie would still be doomed, they spent way too much time and emphasis on the nude/sex scenes and way too little were spent on the few action scenes they had. I would totally categorize this as an action/adventure porno. Just all around, the attention was put in the wrong places. Snyder refused to put cloths on Dr. Manhattan cause ""that's the way it is in the comics and I want to stay true to them"" yet he felt it was still staying true to the comics by cutting out one of the biggest events in the book, cutting out characters entirely, and completely changing the ending. Yeah, that makes sense. If he'd have stuck true to the other stuff and put Speedos on Manhattan, I really don't think anyone would have cared."
"zardoz-13","10","1","9","8 March 2009"," The Flip Side of ""The Incredibles""
","Anybody who has read Alan Moore's ground-breaking graphic novel ""Watchmen"" should enjoy the R-rated, 161-minute, Warner Brothers/Paramount Studios' big-screen adaptation. ""Dawn of the Dead"" director Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" ranks as the best costumed crime fighters movie of all time. Think of it as the ""Gone with the Wind"" of superhero sagas. ""Watchmen"" makes both ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Batman Begins"" look like adolescent fantasies. The crime busters of ""Watchmen"" aren't role models, and the novel and the film both emerge as hopelessly cynical with cosmic irony galore. Scenarists David (""X-Men"") Hayter and newcomer Alex Tse have retained about 90 percent of Moore's novel.<br/><br/>This exciting epic about a faction of superheroes based in New York City who come out of retirement (call it the dark flipside of ""The Incredibles"") to save the world from itself qualifies as an elaborate exercise in cutting-edge computer-generated visuals and high-octane, adrenaline-laced heroics. Parents who take their children to see ""Watchmen"" ought to be reported to the Department of Human Services. Although the violence isn't gratuitous, ""Watchmen"" features scenes of acute brutality and carnage. An unsavory superhero guns down a pregnant Vietnamese woman with extreme prejudice after she slashes his face with a broken beer bottle. In another scene, a prison inmate brandishes a portable, electric circular saw and mistakenly cuts off another inmate's forearms. Violence is one aspect of ""Watchmen,"" while nudity is quite another. ""Watchmen"" is undoubtedly the first mainstream Hollywood movie that presents full frontal male nudity, too. The only genuine superhero, Dr. Manhattan, parades around more often than not in his birthday suit, looking like Obsession cologne product placement.<br/><br/>The far-fetched action unfolds one dark, gloomy night with one of these crime fighters, Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of ""Grey's Anatomy""), swaps blows with an assailant who has invaded his high-rise apartment. In an amusing reference to his last movie, director Zach Snyder has designated 300 as the number of Comedian's apartment. The assailant beats Comedian to a pulp and then propels him through a plate-glass window without a qualm. Comedian plunges many stories to the street below and splatters in a bloody pile of limbs and legs. Naturally, the N.Y.P.D. doesn't have a clue. One of Comedian's fellow crime fighters, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Halley of the 1976 ""Bad News Bears""), launches his own investigation. Rorschach warns the rest of his cohorts, Night Owl 2 (Patrick Wilson of ""Lakeview Terrace""), Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup of ""Almost Famous""), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode of ""Match Point""), and Silk Spectre 2 (Valerie Perrine lookalike Malin Akerman of ""27 Dresses"") that somebody is out to slaughter them. <br/><br/>For the record, Night Owl 2 is the equivalent of Batman, without a Robin, who flies around in a stealth fighter that resembles an electric shaver. Silk Spectre 2 is a butt kicking Wonder Woman clone. She doesn't need a man to hold her hand, especially when she helps liberate one of her own during a prison break with convicts lining up to smudge her make-up with fists and feet. Rorschach is a pint-sized Humphrey Bogart type who wears a stocking over his face with an ink blot pattern that shifts. He is an uncompromising crime buster who sees life in terms of good and evil with no shades of gray. Ozymandias is the smartest man in the world with a flair for public relations. He has the ability to move around as rapidly as Ricochet Rabbit. Dr. Manhattan is a tall, blue, bald, blank-eyed muscular male who wears eye-liner and mascara, hates wearing clothing and can atomize anything with a thought. Again, Dr. Manhattan is the only superhero in the Watchmen group.<br/><br/>DC Comics published Moore's graphic, twelve-chapter novel in 1986 and 1987. Like the novel, the theatrical ""Watchmen"" takes place back in 1985. Essentially, ""Watchmen"" is a science-fiction saga about an alternate version of America. Snyder's movie condenses over twenty years of costumed crime fighter history during the opening credits. Indeed, ""Watchmen"" combines elements of ""Forrest Gump"" and every Oliver Stone movie since ""Platoon."" President John Kennedy shakes hands with Dr. Manhattan, while President Richard Nixon exploits Dr. Manhattan as a nuclear deterrent. The story includes JFK's assassination in Dallas, Texas, with a clear view of his assassin. In the time altered universe of ""Watchmen,"" America wins the Vietnam War largely through Dr. Manhattan's intervention.<br/><br/>In the beginning, Dr. Manhattan was ordinary Jewish physicist Jonathan Osterman. He died tragically during an accident at a top-secret, government research lab that disintegrated his body. He manages to reconstitute himself and emerges as America's chief weapon against the Soviet Union. Nixon dispatches Dr. Manhattan to Vietnam with Comedian, and Dr. Manhattan wins the war. Despite victory in Vietnam, America still wallows in domestic turmoil that degenerates into chaos and street violence. Hippies plant flowers in the rifle barrels of military policemen who massacre them. The police go on strike and eventually Nixon passes legislation that outlaws vigilante-minded costume clad crime fighters that aren't employed by the government.<br/><br/>Basically, the ""Watchmen"" plot defies synopsis. Like Moore's novel, the story boasts enough material for an entire film franchise, but ""Watchmen"" does an excellent job of bringing all the action together in less than three hours to create a coherent but outlandish parable of an alternate future. The idea that victory in Vietnam would not have made a difference in the American Dream is fairly audacious for any movie. Moreover, Snyder and his scenarists take the concept of vigilante heroes farther than even ""The Dark Knight"" dared and meditates on the ultimate contradictions involved with these costume clad crime fighters. The 9/11 finale with its surprise ending is a mind-blower that will leave you reeling. Like ""Forrest Gump,"" ""Watchmen"" inserts several landmark rock songs to underline its multiple messages. ""Watchmen"" lacks a happy ending and the problems that humanity faces here aren't simple."
"Chris_Docker","8","1","9","8 March 2009"," Mental, ethical and visual overload?
","I wouldn't easily believe that yet another movie could squeeze a tear from me to the tune of The Sounds of Silence. In The Watchmen, a coffin of a murdered, unloved anti-hero is lowered into the ground. But the scene is juxtaposed with images of the U.S. in Vietnam, bringing to mind the terrific human sacrifice of that war.<br/><br/>What makes the song more poignant is the silent message. The film has rewritten history so that America achieves greater triumph in the war - with the aid of a super-being, Dr Manhattan. We are asked to mourn heroes victorious in death. But we know the reality to be much sadder.<br/><br/>Music is used throughout The Watchmen sparingly but always to great effect. Comfortably seated in the cinema, I thought I was still watching trailers as the film started. As an extremely unrealistic fight unfolds I make a mental note to avoid whatever film is being touted. But as the credits gather pace I struggle to come to terms with whatever is about to begin. In rapid succession, JFK is assassinated, Warhol heralds the pointless as fashionable, someone lands on the moon, Bowie ambles along outside a gig in a Ziggy Stardust mask and . . .<br/><br/>Masks. Always fashionable. In arts, literature and crime. Who can deny the lure of being anonymous? The flirtation for which you don't have to account. The character greater than yourself. For good or evil, masks are a liberation.<br/><br/>Suddenly Dylan's gritty, Times They Are a-Changin' cuts across the confusing tableau of history and fiction and we realize a joke is being played. The mask slips. We don't have to take it all so seriously. A grotesque ensemble of police officers pose for the camera. They will develop into a new breed of crime fighters to carry on where the police leave off. Eventually, as our story gets into full flow, they have evolved into 'The Watchmen' and one or two have picked up superpowers along the way. Dylan's compositions feature again later in the film with Hendrix's blazing All Along the Watchtower cover and end with a barley recognizable punk cover of Desolation Row by My Chemical Romance.<br/><br/>The film combines comic-strip with film noir. ¨The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood.¨ It's almost a Sin City with real people. It's a city that, ¨screams like an abattoir full of retarded children.¨ And the city is a pre- clean-up New York, though our tale will take us to Antarctica and Mars as the world hovers on the brink of nuclear war.<br/><br/>The Watchmen excels at defying expectations. If director Zack Snyder's previous offering, 300, was a little one-dimensional, The Watchmen almost suffers from the opposite. The film squeezes (with a few alterations) a dozen apocalyptically awesome comic episodes into a mammoth story, preserving much of the original's intention to question our assumptions about superheroes or the black-and-white nature of good and bad. Intellectually and graphically, it is comic-strip for adults.<br/><br/>But although Snyder has pulled off a remarkable achievement, The Watchmen almost suffers from the excess of its own success. The 'wow' factor is maintained for almost three hours and with little breathing space. Ham-acting is mirrored against genuine tear-jerking moments. Dialogue is edgy. Special effects are sheer brilliance. But after a couple of hours I was almost suffering from adrenalin overload. There were any number of moments when the credits could have rolled and I would have applauded an excellent ending. Not that any footage is gratuitous or wasted. Snyder hammers his points home as our sympathies are pulled by different arguments and different Watchmen. Can moral righteousness have a point if it doesn't work? Is there an alternative to a cynical view of man's animal nature? The questions are asked without once being patronizing or overly simplistic. But the experience may leave you somewhat exhausted."

","This movie was enjoyable from beginning to end. When i walked out of the theaters i wasn't sure what to think of this film until i came home and realized this movie was incredible. I rated it 8 stars because I'm not gonna lie there were many boring parts which brought the stars down minus 2. I especially enjoyed watching Rorschach and The Comedian, they were incredibly enjoyable to watch but the scenes which bugged me the most were pretty much Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias. I enjoyed Dr. Manhattan a little more the Ozymandias because he had that twist to him. He had those powers which were enjoyable to watch, but the similarity between both of them were they were both geniuses and used too many high term words and long boring sentences that i couldn't stand towards the end of the movie. As to Rorschach and The comedian, they were both always doing amazing jaw dropping things and kept me off my seat the hole way through. Now as to Silk Spectre and Nite Owl, they were, in my opinion, very lame and boring. They had one scene which was great but other then that they were both very plane and simple. I hope this helped with anything you wanted to know about the movie, Thank you for reading."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","0","1","21 December 2019"," Zack Snyder's most 'Zack Snyder' movie.
","'Watchmen (2009)' is certainly a mixed bag. Some moments are great, some moments are poor and the end result resides somewhere in between. It's probably Zack Snyder's most 'Zack Snyder' movie, but it's also probably his best. Each and every moment feels obsessed with seeming 'cool', stretched out with Snyder's signature slow motion and visual tinkering. Most images resemble the panels of its source comic an impressive amount, comparable almost 1:1 in many cases. This gives the film its distinct style but it also causes it to feel oddly slow; it revels in each moment, rolling around in its self-serious visual splendour. It all feels rather self-congratulatory, constantly content with itself. While its imagery is definitely an achievement, it seems like the sole focus. The story is messy and structurally unsound, oddly paced and severely back-loaded. The majority of its runtime is dedicated to what's essentially exposition, as the piece makes a point of introducing the alternate-history world and satirical superhero characters that will be at stake in its final third. When things finally get going, it's rather interesting and enjoyable. Its relatively nuanced finale is only marred by the fact that its majority is conveyed through dialogue-based exposition. The antagonist reveals his entire plan in typically bad guy fashion, explaining his motivations to the characters and audience alike, while making a point of saying that he isn't a 'comic-book villain'. Luckily, it's rather intriguing and has a subversive payoff. The finale is probably the most cohesive part of the entire picture. The rest sort of feels cobbled together, comprised of clunky story and bone-cracking action. It also feels long, with several moments practically screaming to be cut (the final scene is detrimentally elongated by a random Ronald Reagan gag, for example). However, there are several set-pieces that practically burn themselves into your brain, remaining long after the plot has slipped from memory. A stand-out is Dr. Manhattan's always-happening origin story, which feels like a complete short in and of itself. It's this kind of storytelling that the movie excels at, even if it never quite trusts its audience. It seems to misunderstand the comic's satirical view, though; there are several incredibly earnest scenes that don't have a hint of irony. The character Nite Owl suffers the most from this, his earnest boy-scout dialogue being treated with the same scene-chewing sincerity as everyone else's. Wilson does a good job with what he has, though. So does Haley, who manages to deliver his purposely over-worked noir narration with conviction and confidence. Crudup does well playing a blue-skinned, god-like being losing touch with his humanity and Morgan manages to bring a slimy, sort of sickening charm to his near-comically evil character. Goode is good at hamming it up, Akerman is decent, if unremarkable, and Gugino is underused but as good as ever. The whole cast do a good job of elevating the affair's less successful moments but they can't quite save everything. There are some really cringe-worthy elements and, at times, the thing is almost boring. It's always just about engaging enough, though. In general, it's typically entertaining. Its traditionally 'superhero' action is well-conceived, if out of place, and its tone is typically consistent. Ultimately, the experience is too long and too uneven for its own good, but it's still a good effort, especially for an adaptation of an 'unfilmable' book. It's worth a watch. 6/10"
"afbagwellbiz","6","0","1","27 November 2019"," A serviceable adaptation that caters mostly to fans
","""Watchmen"" was one of my favorite graphic novels growing up alongside ""V for Vendetta"" and ""The Sandman"". How it changed the comic book industry at the time of its printing is legendary.<br/><br/>So naturally there had to be a big screen adaptation at some point, and Zack Snyder brought it to movie-going audiences ... with mixed results.<br/><br/>So much of this film hit all the right notes at the technical level -- cinematography, music, costumes, special effects. It also has a great cast that clearly are committed to their roles.<br/><br/>But Watchmen the movie lacks two critical elements that ultimately relegate it to being a mediocre film. First, the slavish devotion to the source material (except the part about how NYC is destroyed). This is a directorial choice by Snyder that locked him into a poor means of telling the story to audience members who had not read the book. Second, this was further hampered by the vast amount of world-building that had to be cut due to time limits that withheld critical context about how and why events unfolded as they did. Taken together these drawbacks affected everything from character relationships to explaining why the show was so dark and talky and not full of typical superhero action tropes -- like the fact that costumed super-villains didn't exist.<br/><br/>In my mind, this was a repeat of another colossal mistake made just two years before in the movie, The Golden Compass. Like Watchmen, it had to deal with a massive amount of ""alternate history"" world-building that couldn't be included and also chose to closely adhere to the source material. So in both films you got scene after scene that were perfect renditions of moments from the book, but they lacked all the background that connected one scene to the next. Fans of both series could follow and admire the craftsmanship of seeing these worlds brought to life. Non-fans though were left scratching their heads about what was going on despite reams of visual detail and passing references to events and things they'd never encountered before.<br/><br/>45 minutes into my theater viewing of TGC, I leaned over my movie-going buddy and asked him if he knew what was going on. He whispered back he was totally lost. Two years and 45 minutes later I asked him the same question during Watchmen. He said he was following but didn't understand a lot of what was going on.<br/><br/>It was then I knew this movie would have a loyal fan base but the broader public reception would be tepid."
"mikethewise","9","0","1","22 November 2019"," Watchmen Ultimate cut
","There are a few things about the film that bothered me, such as making dr Manhattan the blame for the destruction of NYC, when they could've still had the giant hybrid squid. And with more time and resources, zack Snyder definitely could've made a definitive adaptation of Watchmen. But what we do have is still good on its own merits. I will say that the theatrical cut Did not give this film the credit it deserves, but the closest of a definitive adaptation of Watchmen we'll ever get is the Watchmen Ultimate Cut, where it's not only the directors cut, but more additional scenes , and the animated short of tales of the black freighter, which is actually a great addition to the cut, because the story within the story is pivotal to the theme and story. I do like that the two Bernards were added in the cut as well, and that it gave a really great feeling of a loyalty to the source material, if only the detectives and doctor malcolm's stories stayed. But it all blends well, and despite some minor changes and a few rushed lines or two, this is definitely worth the watch, if you're willing to spare the 3 hours and 30 minutes of your time, which I definitely am. So in short, theatrical cut dud, director's cut good, Ultimate Cut DEFINITIVE WATCHMEN EXPERIENCE."

But this one is much more!<br/><br/>Watchmen isn't only the imaginative plot coming from the mind of Ozymandias, it is in addition a lot of thoughts, a touch of symbolism, a brilliant study of ""super-heros"", all this coming from the mind of Alan Moore.<br/><br/>For one time, the story is unchanged from the comic to the movie: there isn't any rethinking ""à la"" Fantastic Four. All the ideas that Moore wanted to address are found: the ""politics"" of super-heroes, their sexuality, their drive to do the ""good"". The cast is excellent and really looks alike their paper characters. Thus, the panels come alive, more powerful than ever with the movie language: close-up, traveling, sound, especially songs.<br/><br/>In Imax, you are so close of the drama that you live such unforgettable moments: for the JFK assassination, I thought that Jackie was really swimming in a pool of blood; at the burial of the comedian, seeing the WTC with the ""sound of silence"" was really moving. Unlike Spidey who was too shy to face the truth (erasing the WTC is erasing its memory!), having it in the background in a movie about massive destruction is very symbolic.<br/><br/>The final twist is amazing and really motivates me to read the comics again..."

","Watchmen! What can we say about this masterpiece! I can say that you need to see this movie couple of times. For me every person is right, no one is wrong and no one is bad. But Rorschach is my favorite guy here, he's very cool and he has character like nobody else. 
For me Watchmen is number 1 comics movie in history of cinematography!"
"malcydon","7","0","1","9 June 2018"," A bit too much, too vague, too long
","The show has it's absolute pro's, such as some characters, like Roschack, Dr. Manhattan, The Nightguy. The setting is pretty good too. There are a lot of good things, hard to grasp, but it's there. The politics, the grim, the power, all of them fits pretty well. Than there is the philosophy.. and the story.<br/><br/>I also feel, that some things are just.. bad, out of place. Especially the philosophy.
The thoughts, the ideas, which the movie is trying to imagine or screen are just bad. Sometimes childish. It feels forced, it feels long. Most of them could be summed up easily, and answered in the same way. It falls flat on the face.
It was so hard to watch through all the scenes and explanations that were put together like some childlike idea, which than was kept being pulled longer and longer.<br/><br/>The story... well.. Not the best. The start and lead up was good.
An afterworld of the hero era with some remainders and political influence. Not realistic political influence or put together. More like a wash up. But okay.<br/><br/>Than came the mid part and the end. The animation was good, but out of place and explaining way too much. I was happy to see it, but absolutely unnecessary in this form.
The whole Adrian thing is just bad at best. The whole Dr. Manhattan as the ""uniting enemy"" is just stupid. It's.. faulty at every stage.
To put such a scrapped together ending to such a long and mixed together movie.. well.. a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>So I would say the first hour is exciting, interesting, than downhill from then. 
I didn't like how there are gangs with Roschack around. It makes no sense. He is like a sociopath Batman. How are they even alive?
How he died was emotionally touching. I'm not sure if.. it was sound. But I really liked his character and the actor did a great job, his death was emotional.
I would say he was the max of the story."

If the ending was left as it was in the book, this would have been PERFECT! Jackie Earle Haley is amazing as Rorschach, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan isn't far behind as the Comedian!

"neazy","7","0","1","20 November 2017"," A valiant effort
","This is hard one to describe. Looking at it coldly, it's overlong, messy, and sometimes frustratingly confusing, and yet I came out of it feeling thoroughly glad I'd seen it. I haven't read the graphic novel - as with V for Vendetta, I wanted to enjoy the film for itself without it having to live up to the original in my mind - but I look forward to doing so. From my scant knowledge of it, it sounds like a very difficult thing to adapt into a film, and I think that this actually does a reasonable job. You can feel it straining to contain its content at times, particularly in the first half, but once it gets into its swing, it begins to enjoy its own chaos, and feels more fluid. This is a flawed effort, but no less entertaining for it. It's not quite funny enough to make laughter possible, and not quite dark enough to feel truly desolate, but the balance, whilst not mind- blowingly feels-inducing, is effective, and generates a atmospheric integrity that lends weight to proceedings. The characters are intriguing, if occasionally confusing, and I appreciated the fact that I didn't recognise many faces, as this allowed characters without a greatly developed backstory to have independent weight. There are some fine performances: The Comedian stands out, as does Rorschach, despite appearing disconcertingly to use the same voice modulator as Bale's Batman. It's just a shame that the ultimate villain reveal is rather obvious from early on. Overall, despite its problems, this is a worthwhile watch because it feels like it was made with genuine heart. There is a sense that it is not quite good enough to be an unqualified success, but it also film feels as though it admits its own difficulties - it doesn't take itself too seriously, giving itself the freedom to have fun. This bravery is commendable."
"hatsunemiku-27340","8","0","2","11 September 2017"," A Great Film Ruined by a Juvenile Director
","Zack Snyder is arguably one of the consistently worst directors of big budget action films in the past century. There's Michael Bay, there's Roland Emmerich, and then there's Zack Snyder. He gained fame and popularity for his adaptation of 300, a film that's alright but nowhere near as good as most make it to be. His second major graphic novel/comic adaptation, Watchmen, is his best movie in my opinion. He would go on to direct the childish Sucker Punch, ridiculously edgy Man of Steel, and the horrendous Batman v Superman. He's a director directing what he loves but his attachment to the medium of comic books and film is of dubious nature. His interviews have had him discuss his love for violence and rape and edgier subject matterhe comes across as a fourteen year old in an adult body and his films reflect that constantly.<br/><br/>The problem with Snyder and the reason I despise him so much is the fact that he actually has a lot of talent and Watchmen showcases it immensely. The direction, shot composition, and comic book feel of the film is brilliant. It's a sublime piece of artistic film making and a wonderful adaptation of what was considered an unfilmable graphic novel. If not for some self-indulgence, this would probably be my favorite comic book film of all time.<br/><br/>Flubs in Watchmen come in the form of Snyder's more childish tendencies. The violence of the film, for instance, is entirely excessive. The graphic novel never reached the levels of gory viciousness portrayed here and while the violence of the comic was meant to be shocking and push a point, the violence of Snyder's film is over-the-top and shocking in how senseless it is. For instance, the prison scene. Night Owl and Silk Spectre want to break out Rorschach. In the comic, it's a quick couple of panels. In the film, Snyder has a drawn out action sequence for no reason. He's obsessed with the violence and while he does a great job crafting the characters and more mundane moments, the extravagance of the violence is off-putting.<br/><br/>The other thing I hate about this movie is the reliance on licensed music. The amount of music in the film is insane and so much of it feels entirely unnecessary. Playing Sound of Silence during The Comedians funeral is one such example. A solemn moment that leads to painful reflections for the characters should have been silent but for the sound of falling rain. Shoehorning Simon and Garfunkel in is tone deaf as you can get.<br/><br/>And then the Hallelujah scene. Silk Spectre and Night Owl have sex in his flying craft Archimedes. What should have been a quick fifteen second scene of passion with heavy breathing and other associated sounds becomes completely terrible with Hallelujah playing over the course of two-ish minutes of an awkward, voyeuristic sex sequence with a painful orgasm joke at the end. This one scene is enough to ruin the film overall for many viewers.<br/><br/>Despite the two issues above, issues that plague Snyder movies for his entire career, I still love Watchmen. The Director's Cut version or the 215 minute version are the ways to go as they flesh out the characters better and leave a lot more of the good parts of the movie. That's the problem: Snyder thinks the good parts are the sex and violence. He likes the dark stuff but doesn't understand the human elements. The audience thinks the good parts are the characters. This is a film propelled by a great script, good actors, and excellent directing in most respects. But it's also a film that shows a director who takes it upon himself to over-emphasize the wrong things.<br/><br/>It's too bad that the masterpiece of genre subversion and the deconstruction of comic books as a whole, Watchmen, has a film version with so many issues. Because, let's face it, Logan is by and large the better anti-conventions comic book film and will most likely have a much longer legacy than Watchmen ever did."

","Watchmen is seen as a very different and more adult-oriented superhero film genre than what we are mainly used to seeing. This film is set in an alternate 1985 United States, a nation on the brink of nuclear war with the USSR, and with Richard Nixon enjoying his fifth term as president. <br/><br/>Although we weren't as familiar with or as enamored by the source material as some prior to the movie's premiere. Director Zack Snyder has also cast the film exceptionally well as the lead actors do their role. Mainly Jackie Earle Haley is the standout portrayed as Rorschach, while Patrick Wilson makes a strong impression as Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl. As well as Malin Akerman (Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre) play the two Watchmen who most enjoy being superheroes, and they run with it. This film is definitely filled with more adult content as in the tone is dark and moody, and not as happy settling as many past seen superhero films. Watchmen has a lengthy running time but there is much build up to certain scenes and characters that it is well worth the wait. <br/><br/>Unfortunately this film was not a success at the box office (mainly in favor of the foreign market) that a sequel was not in the works. Well, as a stand alone film, Watchmen is visually stunning, filled with inept characters and a plot that is worth watching and waiting for. Watchmen, as many have said, is not a film for younger audiences and entertainingly not for everyone."
"cdjh-81125","9","0","3","6 January 2017"," A Daring Narrative That Tests The Limits of Film
","Zack Snyder's Watchmen is an extremely ambitious movie that seemed as if it would be impossible to make into a feature film so even if this film hadn't worked and had fallen apart I would still have to admire the effort of trying to bring such a complicated narrative to film but luckily I can do more than just admire the effort, I can marvel at a truly fantastic superhero film that I happen to love. One of the things I love the most about this movie the fact that it is first and foremost a character piece, we have constant flashbacks to our main protagonists, giving us backstory to them and how it shaped the people they are today. These flashbacks never feel forced or distracting, they never stop the pace but flow naturally and feel organic to the film. All the characters are uniquely different and entertaining in their own right with my favourite easily being Rorschach played to perfection in an amazing performance by Jackie Earle Haley, the character is such a wounded and violent soul which makes him entertaining and investing he by far has the best arc in this film. I also loved the character of Nite Owl, he seemed like such a real person weighed down by the legacy he feels he cannot live up too and I loved his chemistry with Silk Spectre. The defining trait of these characters are that they ultimately see themselves as doing the right thing and are fighting for something if the greater good but characters like The Comedian balance out the characters creating for a much more colourful and entertaining cast. While the characters do make this film something else I loved about this film was its realism, despite being set in an alternate history this film seemed close to how events like these would occur in real life, the way the public and government react to the whole idea of heroes seemed to be a close telling of how people would react should we be faced with similar obstacles. A common error in superhero films nowadays is a lack of a truly compelling villain but this film doesn't have that problem because all the characters are built up so well he is given crystal clear motivations and while you never quite see yourself agreeing with him you can see the place he is coming from which gives him a better opposition to the heroes. My only flaw with the film is Dr Manhattans sub plot the character in my opinion just was the only character that never made any kind of impression on me, he came across as dull and spends much of the film in solitude that never gives him the excellent interaction that the other characters have making him a fairly forgettable part of this film. <br/><br/>Watchmen is a film that leaves its viewers thinking, it mimics real life and it's amazing cast of characters make this film not only entertaining but intriguing to watch, it's an ambitious film and most of its ambition pays of creating for a film that I will not soon forget. <br/><br/>92%/A"
"lewiskendell","7","0","2","1 February 2016"," A good effort at making a difficult movie.
","The Watchmen film adaptation is both helped and hurt by its cool trailer and its source material. The trailer was amazing enough to encourage those with no previous knowledge of the graphic novel (like me) to check it out before the movie was released. Unfortunately, this only served to raise my expectations a bit higher than they would have been if I would have gone into the experience completely fresh. <br/><br/>Taken for what it is, Watchmen is a laudable effort. While a few key scenes and important plot points ended up on the cutting room floor, that's more of a reflection of how well-written the source material is, rather than gaffs by Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>The narrative and overall flow suffers the most from the necessity of having a reasonable running time. At times the movie just feels like it's a string of cool events that are taken directly from the comic frames, separated by a bastardization of the rest of the story. But then again, once I think of how complex the story is to begin with, it's easier to give credit to it being handled the way that it was.<br/><br/>The acting was OK for the most part, by the end of the movie I had basically accepted everyone in their roles. Dr. Manhattan, Laurie and Dan took some adjusting too, while Rorschach, Adrian Veidt and Edward Blake were more of a natural fit. Some of the dialogue that works so well on the printed page seemed a bit clunky on the screen, but that's to be expected. Watchmen was written as a comic book, not a play.<br/><br/>I think that open-minded newcomers who watch Watchmen stand a pretty decent chance of liking it. It works fairly well as a superhero movie, even without all its depth and complexity. Watchmen veterans, on the other hand, will just have to come to terms with the fact that while the movie wasn't perfect, it will be very difficult to make a better version of Watchmen. Perhaps we should enjoy what we have, changes and all, and just be grateful that this movie was even made. Don't expect perfection from the Watchmen film adaptation, that's what the graphic novel is for."

","WATCHMEN is a 2009 American neo-noir superhero film directed by Zack Snyder and it stars a supporting cast of Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and also Carla Guigino is in the film as well.<br/><br/>It is an adaptation of the 1986 - 1987 DC Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Gibbons.<br/><br/>The film is set in an alternate history in the year of 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as a group of mostly retired superheroes investigates an apparent conspiracy against them and uncovers something even more grandiose and sinister, while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances.<br/><br/>I love the action in this film and the director stayed true to it's source material and it is really amazing and fantastic to see. It took nearly a few years to get this movie on to the screen and finally principal photography took place in 2007 and concluded on 2008. As with previous film 300, Zack Snyder closed modeled his storyboards on the comic, but chose to not to shoot all of this film using green screens and opted for real sets instead and the film was released on March 6, 2009 and was released on DVD and Blu-Ray on July 21, 2009.<br/><br/>The acting is great and my favorite character in WATCHMEN is Rorschach, played by Jackie Earle Haley and he did a very good job in the part. Malin Akerman and Patrick Wilson did struggle in a few scenes, but they were really great and entertaining in this film as Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II.<br/><br/>Matthew Goode plays the perfect hero and villain as Ozymandias and his performance was amazing and spectacular. Billy Crudup plays Doctor Manhattan and his performance was so emotional and sad as hell, but was really great. Carla Guigino is really amazing as Silk Spectre I and she is really great and fantastic in her part. Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian was really amazing and he does not have a lot of screen time, but he is really good and dramatic, but it's a shame that he died in a scene in this film, not the actor, but the part that Dean Morgan plays.<br/><br/>I think the CGI and visual effects were really interesting in this film, along with 300, which I will review soon, this was really amazing for 2009 and this film really did good at the box office, but got a polarized reaction from critics and audiences. Some critics gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews for the dark and unique style on the superhero genre, the cast and the visual effects, while some reacted negatively for the same reason, as well as the R rating for ""strong graphic violence, sexuality, nudity and language"" and this film got a 65% ""fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes and on Metacritic has an averaged score of 56%, but I don't think it should have gotten a mixed and polarized reaction from critics and audiences.<br/><br/>I don't think that is really bad as critics said it to be and it is really good, but the love scene between Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II is a little too romantic because we're seeing their chests and everything, but I just skipped that scene and went on to the next scene, so I would not have to see that part.<br/><br/>Critics also liked and hated this film because of it's run time. The theatrical version is 162 minutes long -- 2 hours and 42 minutes -- and that is an hour and a half long. The director's cut is 186 minutes long -- 3 hours and 8 minutes -- and that's over three hours and a half long. I have not seen the other versions of this film, but I do think that the original version is really cool. In November 2009, a four-disc set was released titled ""Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut"" and this included the director's cut version re-edited with an animated cartoon as featured in the graphic novel, bringing the film's run time to 215 minutes long.<br/><br/>Tyler Bates' musical score is a little confusing to describe because I like it and hate it, but he could have done better, but no hard feelings, right? The rest of the story is really amazing and awesometacular and just really cool as hell.<br/><br/>Overall, WATCHMEN is not the best comic-book film adaptation in the world, it could have been bad, but Zack Snyder and Company did a really great job and I could have not been more pleased. So, I will give it a 6.5 out of 10."

","First of all i'm gonna go out and say that this movie is freaking awesome. With that being said WATCHMEN had it's problems with the wooden acting at times and the strange way the story is told but if you read the graphic novel there are parts that make no sense and there are parts that make sense. But to be fair to Zach Snyder he was pretty faithful to Alan Moore's Graphic Novel and narrative, however that could be part of the problem with the movie. Just because a movie is faithful to the source material doesn't automatically make it a good movie, in fact it make it more confusing. With that being said the characters were actually likable especially Night Owl, Roarshack, and The Comedian ""who makes the most sense in the movie"". All in all i think this is one of the most underrated movies i've seen."

The strength of this movie comes from the complexity of human brain, ranging from bad actions for good reasons or good actions for bad reasons. Thus, the Watchmen team represent all human behaviors. I particularly appreciated Dr Manhattan and may read the comic books to know more about him. I also like the uchronic story, even if 3 hours seems a little bit too long.

The use of lighting and shadowy rooms to create a sense of mystery with the answer to your questions just outside your reach. The casting is well done almost as if the characters were ripped from the pages of the comic book. Patrick Wilson does an amazing job as the second Nite Owl, with Jackie Earle Haley as his former partner, Rorschach. I feel as if they were cast perfectly for their respective roles and it shows throughout the movie. Carla Gugino has a bit more minor roles but she portrays the first Silk Spectre well considering her young age compared to that of the comic character.

Now the plot of this film is almost the exact same as the comics but with a few changes which is The Comedian is killed but a unknown killer and Rorshach wants to find out who did it and then the rest of the watchmen come out of retirement to help and try to stop him. Everything in this movie shocked me and its almost perfect my only problem is some story parts taken out but I have the directors cut and ultimate cut so I'm good. This visuals and costumes are astonishing I love how true but also different everything from the comics turned out and every actor and actress do great job. This movie got lots of mixed reviews from fans and non fans alike I think this is because some fans went in wanting to hate it other wanted more from it and non fans found it weird or not for them, and the main people who complained where mothers and parent they took children grandchildren and kids to see this movie because they thought that this was going to be a film about bright colorful heroes teaming up and fighting crime even though it's rated r for a reason. In my opion this is a great film and I highly highly recommended it I say from ages 12 and up is good but kids from ages 7 to 11 maybe even 5 to 6 year old can handle it if you explain to tnem that this is a movie and they can't do this in real life and cant say some of the bad words and the other ages if your kids can handle 8 out of 10 I love it give it a watch."

This movie has everything, from the use of different music types between scenes, which were all really interesting to listen to. Not quite your mainstream type of soundtrack. Most fit in really well, the lyrics even going along with the story. The character development was great, honestly. I felt like every one of the characters had (thanks to flashbacks) some sort of a story arc. It didn't feel like they well all so righteous just out of nowhere. Well, they weren't righteous in the purest form of the word, these were human beings as well, all but Ozymandias, who was colder than Dr. Manhattan, of course. I feel like this is a completely different movie than some of the newer and even older works in the superhero genre. It is dark but not Nolan- dark, the music certainly adds up to a different feel in the movie. The plot twist is great. Although, maybe expected a little bit, but definitely not as drastic as it turns out to be. Sometimes, the people we thought we knew, aren't what they seem and this movie is great example. This superhero movie stands out among others even if it doesn't have heroes like Batman, Superman etc. It does so by having great scenery, characters and music. It's a completely different experience than any I've had while watching superhero movies."

"hall895","7","0","2","19 December 2013"," Yes, you should watch the Watchmen
","Watchmen is certainly not your typical comic book movie. The first hint of this is that nobody calls the original source material a comic book. It's a graphic novel thank you very much. This implies a certain weight, gravity and seriousness. And it also indicates the reverence fans had for the material. Long deemed unfilmable Watchmen would require not just a very talented director but a brave one. Zack Snyder was up to the task. The film he produced was not perfect. But with all the inherent challenges it was probably as close to perfect as one could reasonably hope. Snyder made a very entertaining, compelling and ultimately quite satisfying film.<br/><br/>Watchmen is not an adaptation of the original printed story. It is that story brought to life lock, stock and barrel. To get the project off the ground it was deemed that adherence to the original story was paramount. And with amazing attention to detail Snyder fills the screen with every bit of that story. This makes for a very dense film. To say there is a lot going on is an understatement. It also of course makes for a very long film, clocking in either side of three hours depending on which version you're watching. But the story holds your interest throughout, with the smart cultural references sprinkled in adding more layers. There is enough big action to carry things through some of the inevitable lulls that come in a film of this length. The film looks spectacular, terrific sets and costumes make the film really pop off the screen. The myriad visual effects are very well done. The music fits in perfectly. And Snyder coaxed winning performances from his cast.<br/><br/>There are a couple of standouts in the ensemble cast. Jackie Earle Haley does a fabulous job as Rorschach. No easy task bringing personality to a character completely hidden away behind a mask, Haley does so superbly. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is excellent as well portraying the Comedian, showing a somewhat less heroic side to the hero. All the other performers fill their roles capably if not spectacularly. The women, Malin Akerman and Carla Gugino, aren't given much to work with and it's hard to get a handle on Billy Crudup's performance at all what with our seeing a CG representation of him rather than the actor himself. But while some may be less memorable than others all the characters work, all the actors did enough to do the story justice. And what a story it is. It's a long journey in this most sprawling of comic book movies. The long trip is well worth it as the film shows why legions of fans consider Watchmen to be no mere comic book."
"ryukdeath23","10","0","2","2 December 2013"," A Great Adaptation Of The Great American Graphic Novel.
","Watchmen is the adaptation of the highly acclaimed and successful graphic novel by the Shakespeare of comic books Alan Moore and The Miguelangelo of comic books Dave Gibbons. The novel itself is pure narrative delightment and a film based on this masterpiece had to be really hard to make, since the comic has a lot of detail. Fortunately in 2009 we had the pleasure to witness the impossible made possible.<br/><br/>Watchmen is set in an alternate and more cynical version of America in the 80's were the United States and The USSR are in the brink of nuclear war. Superheroes exist in this universe but are outlawed by the government. The film opens with a quiet and magnificent fight scene were a retired superhero is murdered. After that, the only superhero active, Rorschach, begins an investigation that leads to a much bigger plot that threatens the world.<br/><br/>The story presents us six main characters, each with a different trait and personality: Edward Blake/The Comedian, Jon Osterman/Doctor Manhattan, Walter Kovacks/Rorschach, Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl II, Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II and Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias. Now I won't go around talking details about these characters because it would take a lot of time, the only thing I can say about these people is that each one of them are a vision and a criticism of several stereotypes that work pretty well.<br/><br/>The movie is gold, although it's not the action-packed-post-300 film that was presented in the trailers, it becomes something more deep that answers the question: How would be the real world if superheroes existed? The TV Spots told us this tag line: You've never seen superheroes like them. And that's true. Watchmen shows us that superheroes are after all, humans. They can be hurt, they can suffer, they can be destroyed and even the only superhero who actually has super-powers has a lot of emotional problems. Superheroes are outsiders, one proof of it is Rorschach's question during one of his philosophical monologues: Is that what happens to us? No time for friends? And even a more dramatic example is Doctor Manhattan himself who becomes heavily detached from humanity due to his powers.<br/><br/>David Hayter and Alex Tse's script pays a lot of homage to the novel, while adding several elements that become superior in the movie. And also keeping and modifying the most ironic ending in superhero history.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder was the perfect choice for Watchmen and if he reads this review sometime I'll just say: You did great Zack. His direction and attention to the shots of the movie really succeed in translating the comic book panels to screen. When I watched Watchmen I felt I was looking at a superhero movie either directed by Ridley Scott or Stanley Kubrick. Snyder makes his first drama film a one of a kind cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>The cast is well chosen, Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays The Comedian with his proper sardonic humor, Billy Crudup plays Doctor Manhattan with the perfect tone of voice that really shows us a complete outsider, Matthew Goode plays Ozymandias with the charm and intelligence required for the character although I expected more of him but nevertheless he plays ""the bad guy"" of the movie successfully, Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl with the emotion required for the role, Malin Akerman is beautiful and sexy but she is one of the biggest disappointments in the movie, anyway, Silk Spectre is one of the weakest characters in the story. I'll make a special mention to Jackie Earle Haley, the actor who played Rorschach. Although he was too short for the height I saw in the comics, he nevertheless is the one who steals the show. His raspy voice and attitude are fit for the role and I was angry because he didn't get an Oscar nomination, I mean, the guy got deep into the role and succeeded. Nevertheless Watchmen was a rebirth on his career.<br/><br/>The films visuals are stunning, the pacing was never a problem for me, the Soundtrack by Tyler Bates is incredible and unique for a Superhero film, The costumes by Michael Wilkinson are a major improvement over the original suits, the photography by Larry Fong is exquisite and engaging, The Production Design by ALex McDowell is so impressive and magnificent that I felt I was watching the comic book in motion, And so many details that make this film a worth seeing.<br/><br/>Watchmen was not that successful at the Box Office because it is an ambitious Superhero Drama film released at the time where lots of action and lots of nonsense sell more tickets. In my concept, the film was worth every Penny and if there's a re-release sometime in the future I'll go and see it.<br/><br/>Watchmen has a divided audience, but the more I ask people about this movie, the more positive responses I get. I hope that when time passes and people start respecting those great movies that were unappreciated at the time of release, Watchmen can be deemed as one of the greatest films of all time. I see it like that, tell me, what do you see?"
"BA_Harrison","8","0","3","24 November 2013"," I finally watched Watchmen.
","After Snyder's atrocious treatment of Frank Miller's 300 (see my IMDb review for details), I was hardly in a rush to see Watchmen, fearing another digitally graded, big-budget CGI w**k-fest with events playing out at half speed; however, being a fan of Alan Moore's work since the early 80s, I finally relented and was pleasantly surprised by what I saw.<br/><br/>Surprised because, although Snyder's Watchmen contains more than its fair share of slo-mo action scenes, orange and teal imagery, and digitally generated nonsense, it didn't annoy me as much as I had anticipated. Surprised because, despite moving at a leisurely pace for almost three hours, I was never bored. Surprised at the extreme level of sex and violence (I thought they might water this down for mass consumption). And surprised by the intelligence of the script (Moore does intelligent easily; Snyder not so much).<br/><br/>If I had seen Watchmen a few years ago, I would have been rather excited when it was announced that Snyder was reworking Superman. As it happens, I wasn't and Man of Steel turned out to be every bit as dreadful as I had feared Watchmen would be.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for Malin Akerman, who looks incredible both in and out of that amazing costume."

","In an alternative reality, America in 1985 is home to a group of former superheroes who have now moved on. But when one of their members is killed in suspicious circumstances, the group is drawn back together; what they uncover could change the course of history as they know it.<br/><br/>For those how haven't read it, 'Watchmen' is a fantastic graphic novel, the first I ever read. From the excellent concept and story, to the beautiful artistry, the novel ranks rightfully as one of the best ever written. The film had a lot to live up to, and I came in with slight reservations. So rather than chop and change it too much, director Zack Snyder smartly does his best to stay true to the text. Now, this works both to his advantage and to his detriment.<br/><br/>The bad first, and it is one major criticism: 'Watchmen' is far too long. There are a few versions out there, and the one I watched clocked in at about two hours and forty minutes. Yes, it's engaging, and so much of the novel is retained in the book, but it requires a great deal of investment. And because the film is so closely adapted from the text, there are long periods where there is essentially a lull. For me, watching a near-three hour film, those lulls were a bit difficult to get through.<br/><br/>However, if you're able to get through the sheer length of the movie, what you're treated to is an extremely faithful and visceral adaptation. The film is violent and unflinching, with some fantastic casting choices. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian) and Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach) are the standout performers – the latter steals every scene he is in. In particular, Rorschach's scenes in the prison are great to watch, and he is exactly as I imagined he would be in the comic.<br/><br/>'Watchmen' also benefits from a very good soundtrack. The use of Bob Dylan's 'The Times They Are A'Changing' in the introductory sequence is the one that everyone raves about, and it is great (it's the perfect accompaniment as the film's place, time and atmosphere is established); however, there are also great songs from the likes of Simon & Garfunkel and Leonard Cohen littered in there, all adding to the spectacle. Snyder also uses the same colour and light tricks he did in '300', giving the visual quality a nice little sheen.<br/><br/>You don't really need to have read the graphic novel to enjoy the film, but I'd argue that knowing the source text will probably make you appreciate just how good the film is. You're going to see some excellent performances, and the story is thoroughly engaging; but as good as it is, it should not need to be close to three hours long."

","Watchmen was a good film, however many people were unhappy about the film, I don't really understand why...the movie is exactly the same as the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Watchmen is directed by Zack Snyder who is the master of visually stunning movies...need I say more, watchmen was visually stunning the movie looked beautiful. Snyder used his amazing visual talents for good, the fight scenes in this movie were amazing as we witnessed great slow motion with violent punches, I feel like Snyder used the opportunity that this movie was R rated. One thing I can say about Snyder's directing in this film was that I felt the setting was too dark, I could have found the film more enjoyable if the camera was slightly brighter (especially after considering that the extended version is 4 hours long!) The opening credits were the best! I loved how Snyder summarized the minute men's story in the credits. <br/><br/>I didn't feel like there was anything special with Watchmen's screenplay, the movie was acted out exactly as it was in the graphic novel, there was no difference what so ever, except for the part in the opening credits where we see the comedian killing Kennedy, which in my opinion was not necessary at all! There was also a character that was removed from the movie, in the Graphic Novel we meet Captain Metropolis, who set up the watchmen meetings, but was replaced with Ozymandias, whom we see set up the meetings. <br/><br/>The casting in watchmen was OK... some performances were brilliant (Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach) but some were very disappointing like Malin Akermen as Silk Spectre II, she looked exactly like Silk Spectre II in the graphic novel but her performance was very disappointing. I was very impressed with Billy Crudups's take on Doctor Manhattan, he seemed very cold blooded just as I pictured him to be in the novel.<br/><br/>Snyder's selection of songs in watchmen were outstanding they seemed to be very appropriate to the context of the film, for example in the funeral as we listen to ""the sound of silence"" play...<br/><br/>I think that if a casual movie goer watches this film, he/she might not enjoy it as much as a person who read the novel, because casual movie goers will feel board when the people who read the novel will feel very fascinated with Snyder's visuals, and the fact that the film is exactly like the graphic novel!"

","People often say that comic-to-movie transitions are terrible because the creators always change things to make it ""work on film"". I kind of understand how that is wrong, now that I've seen a film where it was almost exactly done as a comic would be done. Which isn't to say there's no logic in that saying, but that we seem to not understand (as fans) what actually works and what does not. Sure, there were changes for a more modern age, but it was still done in comic-style...and you could really tell. Good movie, enjoyable seeing something so meaningful to me put on the screen, but quality comics should stay on the page. That's more clear now."
"TheComicsGuru","9","0","1","16 August 2013"," Who Watches The Watchmen? You should.
","For decades, comic books were considered only for children. Then along comes Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, and their golden offspring ""Watchmen"". It turned the comic industry on its ear for its sophistication and deconstruction of superheroes, making them more believable than before. Its reputation is well deserved. But could a *good* movie version be done? In my opinion the answer is yes.<br/><br/>While there were some elements that were removed or altered, the movie adapts the vast majority of the comic series for the big screen. While this sounds like a cheat, this is absolutely necessary. Unlike other superhero movies, Watchmen can't stray far from the source material without losing its unique qualities or perspective. <br/><br/>Overall Snyder and company have created a faithful version of the 1985 world from the comic series. A world that is on the brink of nuclear war with only a handful of psychologically troubled individuals to stop it. The actors truly bring their respective characters to life, fulfilling one of the primary themes of the series: realism. In short, I can't imagine a better movie version of this story being produced. The only negative comment I can make about the movie is its length. At 2:42 its an investment in time, but well worth it. <br/><br/>While this is not a movie for children or the easily offended, Watchmen is a brilliant, complex tale of how heroes would behave in the real world. And the real world is never as black and white as Rorschach would have you believe."

In my opinion its one of the more underrated movies out there. The soundtrack is nice. The intro credits with Bob Dylan is my favorite part of the whole movie. The choice of song in the funeral scene was also great. Dr. Manhattan's story was cool and engaging.

"marian424","7","0","1","21 January 2013"," Who watches the Watchmen?
","After reading the book, I kind of dreaded watching this movie. But I actually didn't hate it. At all.<br/><br/>The movie is very faithful to the book's script, moving around lines when necessary. This only bothered me at the end when Silk Spectre II got Dr. Manhattan's line ""nothing ever ends.""<br/><br/>Manhattan's special effects work very well. He looks exactly like he should (dick and all), but his voice lacks a certain quality that a godlike being should have. He sounds like a moody teenager.<br/><br/>Silk Spectre II looks the part, except she isn't wearing silk, she's wearing latex. I have no problem with this change, since it makes sense that her mother would want her to be more modern, and thus successful. I understand that Zach Snyder wanted all young actors in this movie, but Silk Spectre II suffers the worst from poor dramatic timing in her lines that a more experienced actor would have aced. The actors playing Rorschach and the Comedian were surprisingly great, and saved the movie for me.<br/><br/>Zach Snyder's use of slow motion is often mocked by critics, but it worked at certain parts in this movie. The Comedian being thrown out the window, for example, looked great in slow motion. The fight that comes right before this event, however, would have been much better in real time, especially since it supposed to be made ironic by the sweet background music.<br/><br/>Zach Snyder also uses tons of violence, but then again, so did the graphic novel. The only part where I found myself laughing at the violence was during the assassination attempt on Ozymandias when a woman's CGI fingers get blown off for no apparent reason in slow motion. The CGI is good, for 2009. Dr. Manhattan and his structure on Mars look magnificent, but CGI blood and gore never seems to look just right.<br/><br/>The opening credits, a fantastic sequence explaining the rise and fall of the Minutemen and Watchmen set to a Bob Dylan song, is easily the best part of the movie. The soundtrack, by the way, is fantastic.<br/><br/>Now that all of that is out of the way, we come to the important part: Alan Moore. His works have been adapted into movies before, with varying degrees of success, but Moore declares that he hates any movie version of his work and refuses to watch them. Who watches the Watchmen? Not Alan Moore. Zach Snyder has said that he would like for Moore to give this movie a chance, since it is a fairly faithful adaptation of Moore's work. But that's exactly the problem. It's fairly faithful. It doesn't change enough of the original to feel like a new experience, but changes too much to feel like a truly faithful adaptation. I think Mr. Moore can skip watching this one.<br/><br/>Concerning Snyder's changes to the story, I have mixed feelings. The idea of Ozymandias turning the world against Dr. Manhattan instead of aliens actually worked for me. I would like to know why Alan Moore didn't use that idea in the first place. I'm sure it occurred to him. The change I disliked was Snyder leaving out the stories of the newspaper vendor and comic book reader, the lesbian couple, and the psychiatrist and his wife. They made the book feel that much more real, and made the disaster near the end feel that much more painful and powerful. Snyder should have included these stories. Time obviously wasn't an issue, since the director's cut is three hours long.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is okay. It's not really worth watching if you've read the book, but it's not terrible. The opening credits, the performances of Rorschach and the Comedian, and the Mars sequence all make this movie good, but it is flawed by excessive slow-motion, CGI blood and gore, inexperienced supporting actors, and missing elements of the book."
"ryan-craven","8","0","4","5 November 2012"," Watchmen is undeniably brilliant as a graphic novel adaptation.
","Despite all the signs saying it would never in a million years be remade (i.e Gilliam dropping out, Greengrass being refused sufficient financial backing), Watchmen has been made, and it has been made well.<br/><br/>Whilst there were well placed worries that the novel's widespread, complex storytelling and strong political and social messages would be lost in the harsh world of cut editing and running time restrictions, Zack Snyder has managed to hue his film with enough faithfulness and skill to satisfy the fan and uninitiated alike. The action, although being in stylistic slow-mo, is thrilling and nicely executed, the tone is in just the right place between gritty and fantastical and most of the actors, Wilson especially, portray their characters with skill and charisma, two necessities for a story so deep and at times hard to follow. <br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley impress the most, with Wilson bringing his Nite Owl some much needed charm and soft humour, whilst also becoming the character Moore intended him to be, an impotent Batman mixed with a mid-life crisis Clark Kent. Haley, with possibly the coolest character, imbues Rorschach with a very hard edge, and somehow manages to make Rorschach's horrific actions in the film justifiable. Less successful, however, is Matthew Goode, who botches line readings and Veidt comes across as a dull and, despite the meticulous detail and attention Moore wrote him with, Goode's Veidt is one-note and 2- dimensional. Akerman and Crudup are passable, if hardly noteworthy, as Silk Spectre and Dr Manhatten.<br/><br/>Snyder's determination to use music and slow motion so much within the movie means that some of the scenes, like the strange Owl Ship sex scene, fall flat and come across as crass and empty. However, where the movie scores so highly is in the fantastic visuals, that perfectly captures the fantastical yet very scarily realistic alternate universe these characters live in. In sticking so closely with the graphic novel, and thanks to the superb cast, Watchmen, whilst being a visual stunning and thrilling superhero movie, is also a dark and engrossing character study set in the paranoia and secretive Cold War era, perfectly used here. Though it doesn't quite reach for the perfect adaptation that matches the book, this comes very close."

","Watchmen.....<br/><br/>With an opening scene, being a cross between Blade runner, for the grit and instant realisation that the future or in this case, the past, is not the wonderful utopia we all dream for, and Matrix time delay, to intensify the action and drama of our reluctant hero being beaten to death, you hope that more is to come. Sigh<br/><br/>As expected the grit and the filth of this scene continues, along with 1hr of flash backs, and character building that becomes boring and elongated even for those who aren't aware of the characters before hand.<br/><br/>Being bored with this, your eye start looking for other entertainment, and you quickly notices, the similarities between ""league of extraordinary men, eye candy"" and the wide detailed landscape that becomes more interesting that the character that your meant to be watching.<br/><br/>Just as you start to realise that the plot hasn't really developed in too what you would consider worth buying the extra large popcorn for. A love story comes to light, only to be stop, due to lack of medical advances that we are now privity to in too day society.<br/><br/>With a couple of anti-climatic events before and after this one, I was left wondering what the whole fuss was about. <br/><br/>Was it because the acting was little under done, or the characters didn't really have much to do until the end of the movie?<br/><br/>Superhero movie?, No, but a movie that exercises it's political agenda via the interactions of 5 heavy weights that have been force to realise that they don't in fact have super powers, longing for ""the old"" days. <br/><br/>With some great real life, sets, and time relevant hardware, expect for the graphic display of the T.V in the opening scene. Watchmen lacks for me the intensity of the comic, and the desire to back the bad guy, which came through more in the graphic novel, that could have ever hope for in a movie.<br/><br/>Many of the fight scenes are put in place to prove not only to the retired characters but to the audience that they in fact as good as they think they are, but only to a point of dealing with real life situations. As the movie comes to an end, you realise, what should been totally obvious from the beginning that there are only two superhero's in the movie. A reluctant hero, and the megalomaniac villain backed by his own self worth of righteous.<br/><br/>This movie delivers everything it sets out to do, with enough entertainment and eye candy to stave off the boredom, for two and half hours of getting to know normal people, coming to grips of how bad our human race has become.<br/><br/>I grew up with these people in my life, they became everything to me. Superheros did everything I long to grow up and dreamt of achieving. Maybe with age you realise that superhero's don't really exist, only ordinary people wishing they could create world peace. In this case, these people do, but with sudden realisation, that ""Be carefully what you wish for, because one day you might get it"" and it may not be in the way you had dreamt."

","First of all, let me say I am an avid comic book reader and Graphic Novel enthusiast, but never got the chance to read 'Watchmen', so when this movie arrived I made the decision to just watch the film. I understand the vision behind this movie. Just how long can a 'Super-Hero' remain 'Super', until the darkness they have fought all their lives consumes them.It is a tale of desperation, confusion and destruction that leads to the eventual downfall of the hero.<br/><br/>An investigation is conducted by Rorschach, a psychotic masked crusader into the murder of a anti-hero named 'The Comedian', as we delve into this world of Superheroes, nothing is what it seems. There is no perfect life for the Superhero, no wonderful alter-ego they can safely resume, after they have saved the day...Just darkness.<br/><br/>I genuinely feel for the director and the cast, the movie was not as great as it could be, the Graphic Novel was probably more interesting, but this movie has the wrong cast in my opinion expect for Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jackie Earle Haley, the actress who plays 'Silk Spectre 2' does not give a very engaging performance...Neither does anyone.<br/><br/>Comedian's burial is perhaps the most beautiful scene of all, a hero's burial is done in secret with only a few military personnel and his superhero friends.

","Being the ridiculous fan boy that I am, I don't think I need to say how disappointed I was with the movie when I first saw it. I'll cover the reasons why a little bit later on. Now, this film really needs to be given some credit. It scored some brownie points for all Watchmen fans by doing one thing in particular: Existing.<br/><br/>Yes, that's right. It's existence merits success. Inside one of my paperbacks, there is an interview with Lawrence Gordon proclaiming his coming Watchmen movie (as he'd recently obtained the rights). Dozens of screenwriters, producers, and directors have all attempted to make a Watchmen movie for two and a half decades, but nobody but Zack Snyder was successful.<br/><br/>Instead of criticizing what was left out, I'll criticize what was kept (or added) in.<br/><br/>***MUSIC***<br/><br/>On the whole, I give Zack Snyder credit for playing the songs that were depicted in the novel at the correct moments in the movie. However, there are several instances in which the music is entirely opposed to the tone of the scene. Example: Comedian's funeral. Really? ""The Sound of Silence?"" We're lamenting the death of a conscienceless, murderous rapist, who also happens to be an American hero and ""caped"" crusader. I'm not sure that Simon and Garfunkel's poppy, upbeat sound is appropriate. The *actual* sound of silence would have worked perfectly for this scene.<br/><br/>***ACTING***<br/><br/>On the whole, I was content with the acting. However, I could not stand a single moment of Malin Ackerman's acting. One of the most powerful moments in the novel is when she's holding a handgun with both hands shaking with tears streaming down her face pointing it at Adrian and simply says, ""You're an a******,"" because when you're filled with emotion or rage or anxiety, your mind tends to go blank. All she can do is communicate her emotion, and barely, at that. Remember what happened in the movie? She holds the gun with one hand in an almost sassy fashion, looks at Adrian almost seductively, and says, ""You're *such* an a******."" What was that? There was no emotion. There was just...sarcasm? Sass? Why should the audience care about what she's doing if she's just being indignant? The acting for Laurie's mother (Silk Spectre the first) wasn't any better. One of my favorite moments in the novel was when Sally goes over to her bed, picks up the picture of The Minute Men, kisses the picture of the Comedian, and begins crying. She'd finally come to terms with A) What Eddie had done to her, B) That he was dead, C) That she loved him, and D) That she would never see him again. It's very powerful, very sad, and provides some closure for Sally. What happens in the movie? She picks up the picture, maybe kisses it, says something, and then puts it down. It was so boring and unimpressive that I can hardly remember it. Why should the audience care about that? There was absolutely nothing that would capture the audience; no emotion, no character development, so certainly nothing memorable about it.<br/><br/>Last bit, and thanks for reading this far. I didn't expect to rant.<br/><br/>***VULGARITY***<br/><br/>Alan Moore has never been one to be prude. In fact, there is nudity in just about every original work of his I've ever read (V for Vendetta, Watchmen, LXG, Miracleman...), and that is perfectly fine. Perfectly natural. But he depicted it with class. One or two panels to get the point across. He would never dwell on it, because the bodies of the characters aren't important--the emotion behind the sexuality IS important. Well, what happened in the movie? I remember sex scenes lasting an almost comically long time. In fact, I specifically remember (during the first scene between Jon and Laurie) thinking the thoughts, ""...Okay. ...I get it. ...Alright. ...You guys are having sex, I get it. ...For god's sake, enough."" 5-10 seconds would probably have provided a comfortable window of time to illustrate Jon's third hand and Laurie's surprise. Instead they kept it going for maybe 6 times that frame of time. Same story with the sex scene inside Archie. I get that Malin Ackerman is the film's major sex appeal, but, to quote Studio 60, ""They'll think you're sexy if you show them you are. They won't if you show them your a**."" To me, it was just an illustration of sloppy, lazy writing to show off Malin Ackerman's body.<br/><br/>Speaking of lazy writing, remember that part in the novel in Vietnam in the bar with The Comedian and Jon? The woman The Comedian impregnated walks up to him and somewhat bashfully (it seems to me, at least) wants to discuss the baby. The Comedian is dismissive and a general jerk to her, but every work he speaks to her illustrates a lot about his character. The way he speaks, the order in which he says what he says are all components of what makes The Comedian such an engrossing character. Remember what happened in the movie? He just kept on repeating, ""Get the f*** out, get the f*** out of here!"" This also happens in the Keene riot scenes. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Jeffrey Dean Morgan's acting, for the most part, but the interesting and well-structured dialog in those scenes were exchanged for one line constantly repeated to illustrate that he was dismissive, and that's all.<br/><br/>Really, those are the biggest issues that bothered me during the film. The changes to the ending, the gaping plot points that were left out of the film, and the visual similarities to the novel don't matter nearly as much to me as the driving forces behind the characters and their actions do. That is what made the novel so very interesting to me to begin with, and a lot of that is what was left out of the film.<br/><br/>Still, it exists."

"MBunge","7","0","3","21 October 2010"," It's not as good as the comic, but what could be?
","Adapted from perhaps the greatest comic book story ever told, Watchmen needs to be reviewed on two separate levels.<br/><br/>For those of you who have never read the comic, this movie is long, extremely violent and displays more male nudity than most porno films. It asks you to imagine an alternate reality where people back in the 1940s really did start to dress up in costumes and beat the snot out of criminals, becoming a significant aspect of American culture. It then asks you to accept the creation of a second generation of heroes in the 60s, complete with a nuclear superman who can manipulate matter and energy with his merest thought. Then it asks you to embrace an aging Richard Nixon who is still President in 1985 with the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the brink of nuclear war and someone killing costumed crime-fighters.<br/><br/>That's a whole lot of suspension of disbelief to swallow and if you're not willing to gulp it down, you'll probably not enjoy this film. As the underlying plot moves in fits and starts, it spends a lot of time examining this alternate reality, its history and the sort of people crazy enough to become masked vigilantes. I f you can choke down your disbelief, you'll find Watchmen to be one of the more interesting movies you've ever seen. It will probably take you at least 2 or 3 viewings to notice every little detail included in almost every frame. Though I'm certain you'll notice the blue penis right away.<br/><br/>For fans of the original comics, this movie is a mixed bag at best. The filmmakers do an admirable job of taking the basic plot and main characters and getting them on screen without messing things up too terribly. When adapting a work as complex as Watchmen, it's incredibly easy to make a mistake about what to take out, what to leave in and what to change, ending up with something embarrassingly bad. That hasn't happened with this movie and, in fact, the opening credits are remarkable in how they capture so much of the essence of the comic.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those opening credits are the closest the film gets to that essence. Most of the movie resembles what was in the comic, but it's just a bit off. The best example is that the Dan Dreiberg of this film is not fat. The character is close to what he was in the comic in other respects but a Dan Dreiberg who isn't fat, isn't Dan Dreiberg. There's a lot of stuff like that which could really drive you up the wall if you let it.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Jackie Earle Haley is great as Rorschach, Billy Crudup captures the human inhumanity of Doctor Manhattan and Patrick Wilson gets the rest of the non-fat Nite Owl II right. I don't think Jeffery Dean Morgan is nearly seedy enough to be The Comedian, but your mileage may vary. They did change the ending, but I'm not sure that really accomplishes anything. It does give the audience one less unbelievable thing to accept, but it doesn't make any more sense or work any better than the comic ending. In fact, when you consider the point Alan Moore was trying to make with the comic ending, it's probably quite a bit worse.<br/><br/>Whether you like this film or not, I hope it encourages people to read the original comic. And it certainly gives us fans an excuse to read it again. I suppose that's not such a bad legacy for any Hollywood adaptation to have."

","From the opening sequence, to where we are introduced to a wide diversification of notable Americans and prominent moments in American history (JFK Assassination, Conservative think tanker William F Buckley) we understand the scope of this world that is put in front of us. We are in a special time of crisis. And the world needs heroes. Watchmen doesn't disappoint in this regard, but we get more than we bargained for. The heroes that we discover have secrets. They have pain. They are lost. Snyder was able to adapt this film so close to the chest that he brings all the multi layered complexities that Moore did so years ago, and all the problems with it. This film is convoluted. It's messy and long. If the plot was lost on you, or you found you really didn't care about the outcome, welcome to the Watchmen. But the thing of it is, this film isn't really about the plot to find out who killed the Comedian. It's about the heroes who were left behind in this modified Cold War era (Nixon is on his 5th term). It's about relationships. It's about heroes unwilling to waiver in uncertainty and about those who won't compromise. It's about the punishment of the heroes good deeds. The film itself looks amazing. It reached across Gibbons art work and painted it with oil. It's getting the look I always felt the Watchmen needed. The actors are perfectly cast and delivered with conviction. This is an adult film for adults. It's the superhero film adults have always wanted and never think they would get. It's another example how a great film doesn't have to be perfect. Fitting for the Watchmen."

I went last night for a late showing (first bad move) & with my girlfriend (second bad move) – My favorite quote from Felicia, whilst sprawling across the seats in a fit of despair, was ""Oh no do we still have a whole war to go in Antarctica"". The film started in style, a montage of highly saturated, slow-mo, graphic novel images set the scene, dropping us into the mid 80's, this set to a classic Dillon tune made me sit comfortably back in my chair. The comfort factor didn't last long the comedy both spoof/dark were interspersed with hard core violence & teasing taboos. So is there a need for masked vigilantes? Are super heroes 'super' or 'heroic'? Did Rorschach get it right? I enjoyed this film it may be suitable for those with a darker sense of humour, & those with a penchant for 'tools & body combinations' e.g. head & meat cleaver, circular saw & arms you get my drift<br/><br/>Pro's: <br/><br/>i.

","The movie is set in 1980s alternate reality when the position of superheroes is decreasing and a serious possibility of atomic war with Russia emerges. This is a fascinating, multi-layered story benefiting from more than stellar Snyder's direction. With the aid of cinematographer Larry Fong, he captures the unique style of the graphic novel. The movie looks mindblowing being perfectly staged and conceived. There are plenty of captivating slo-mo fight sequences that along with graphic violence are Snyder's trademark. The opening montage is especially unforgettable. Snyder also illustrates some crucial scenes with songs that work as brilliant pop-culture references. The performances are often spot-on with Jackie Earle Haley totally nailing the multi-dimensional psyche of Rorschach and Patrick Wilson who's great displaying more confident version of Nite Owl II. Overall, ""Watchmen"" is a nearly flawless attempt at visualizing an outstanding novel, it's an appropriately complex, brutal, and dark spectacle."
"GloriousGooner","8","0","3","12 March 2010"," Worth the wait
","After 23 years via Aronofsky, Greengrass and Gilliam in defiance of those who said the material was 'unfilmable' Watchmen is here on screen, and how! America, having won the Vietnam war thanks to Dr Manhattan, is in a dystopic 1985 circa 1967 where Superheroes have been forced into retirement - this is The Incredibles in Sin City. The masked detective, Rorschach, is our guide through the story which focuses on the apparent serial killings of ex-heroes. There's a conspiracy but who's behind it, or is Rorschach just paranoid? Throw in some philosophising on the nature of humanity, the American dream taken to the nth degree and a bizarre love triangle between a god, a Lolita character and a geek and you have a truly remarkable film. The large runtime seems lengthy for a comic book film, until you take into the context the size and scale of the source material - the distilling of which into the cinematic medium has been done, in my not-so-humble opinion, brilliantly by Snyder (who previously gave us camp classic 300). The balance of the dark, foreboding noir cityscape part Gotham City part Se7en, with the hyper-realistic violence perpetrated by protagonists sporting the campest of costumes is incredible. Never slipping into slapstick yet never taking itself too seriously they've gone to town with some of the CGI (particularly some of the scenes on Mars) but for the right reasons and to a certain amount of success as far as i'm concerned. There's no sugar-coating here, the story sinks its canines into reality and tears it to shreds in brutal, visceral, style. It's as true to the graphic novel as possible and all the better for it. A film i'll definitely be watching again and again."
"ajs-10","8","0","3","9 March 2010"," A great movie... Just a little too long...
","First of all, I must say that I have not read the graphic novel by Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore. With that out of the way I can now get on with the business in hand. It's kind of weird watching this film, its set in 1985, but not a 1985 that we would recognise. For a start Richard Nixon is president of the United States, there's a lot of tension between the US and the USSR, oh and there are superheroes about (seemingly only in America though). These superheroes have been discredited and are banned from wearing their disguises. So most have gone into retirement, hoping to keep their identities secret.<br/><br/>It is night and one of the superheroes, The Comedian, a.k.a., is disturbed by a knock at the door. A man comes in and a fight ensues, a fight that culminates in the death of The Comedian. The following day, another Superhero, Rorschach begins to investigate the murder. He calls on Nite Owl II, a.k.a. Dan Dreiberg, and also Dr. Manhattan, a.k.a. Jon Osterman and Silk Spectre II, a.k.a. Laurie Jupiter, looking for information but he seems to be getting nowhere. The story is broken up with lots of flashbacks giving us the background to each of these characters, some of which are descendants from previous Superheroes. We also meet Ozymandias, a.k.a. Adrian Veidt, a Superhero who has revealed his identity and is working to find a cheap energy source for the world. It's a very complicated plot, so I won't go any further, you have the bare bones of it there And no spoilers so far! A really well made film with some really great special effects, CGI and some brilliant fight sequences, hats off to the stunt guys for that. It's visually quite stunning as well, I don't know a lot about the technical side of cinematography, but, for me, they got this one just right! Decent performances from all of the main cast, honourable mentions go to Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II, Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan / Jon Osterman, Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias, Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Edward Blake / The Comedian and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II.<br/><br/>It's a really interesting film with a lot of philosophy and politics and some really dark comedy thrown in. I found it quite enjoyable, although it was just too long; if it had been cut to two hours I feel it would have been better. So, overall, a really enjoyable film with some great action and effects, only let down by its length, even so, I still recommend it to you.<br/><br/>My score: 7.9/10"
"nightixu","9","0","3","16 February 2010"," One of the best superhero movies i have ever watched!
","Forget Daredevil. Forget The Hulk. Forget the Fantastic Four. Forget even spiderman. Watchmen has the best plot, excellent action scenes and the aesthetics are very much pleasing to the eyes. I have never read the comic book nor have i ever heard of Watchmen therefore i couldn't have high expectations as most fans of the comic book would have. Alan Moore the creator or watchmen might have been disappointed that his 'baby' had been disfigured and mutated by Hollywood but i believe Zack Snyder and David Hayter the main scriptwriter did a wonderful job of turning the comic book into this great film.<br/><br/>First off, the characters. Each one of the watchmen have interesting and their own unique personalities and the movie tells the audiences their background by shifting the focus of a particular scene on their perspective. Rorschach's is through the dialogue in his journal, Jupiter is through the flashbacks she has, Mr Manhattan is through his own internal thoughts and reminiscence. The two characters that didn't really intimately reveal their past was Dan and Adrian. Though we all get to know about each one of them. That's the whole charm of Watchmen as i've heard. The story within the story. Well the movie managed to accomplish that. By shifting the perspectives to each of the watchmen, we feel as if we get to know each one of them and understand their personalities. <br/><br/>The fight scenes are spectacular. I love the how Zack directed it. It's not cheesy, its not dull and its not over the top. To give a better example, its not like batman forever nor is it like superman returns or the hulk. It's more like the dark knight only with a Zack Snyder style to it just like in 300. The whole story is great and like i've said its not a regular superhero movie. Most of them don't have special powers so it's a little like the Christopher nolan's batman. The whole world is dark and pre-apocalyptic. It's like the x-men plus spiderman and with the darkness of batman. Thats basically the world of watchmen adding in politics and war. <br/><br/>This movie is a must watch because it will stimulate all your senses. It's not a mindless action movie nor is it too dull with a lot of talking. It has a perfect balance of dialogue, story and action. It's also a good way to introduce people to the watchmen comic which i now am interested to read."
"eric262003","6","0","2","11 January 2010"," The Effort Was Flawless, But the Final Product Was A Letdown
","The Alan Moore graphic 1987 novel ""The Watchmen"" ranks as an icon as it took the comic book genre to leap over hurdles by making it into a literary masterpiece. Almost a year ago, I went to see the movie with high expectations that this was going to live up to Moore's novel. The sad truth it turned out to be less than what I have expected. It's not that it was so bad I demanded my refund, it just didn't live up to the novel, even though a lot of heart was put into it. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, the stuff I liked about the movie is that it carefully recreates nearly 90% of the novel, even to the smallest details. Sure that also includes having the honour's of observing Dr. Manhattan's (Billy Crudup)private parts, but more importantly they nailed at the illustrations to near perfection. The visuals and the sound effects were some of the best I've seen in a long time. The narrative of Dr. Manhattan was surprisingly interesting and witty. The action in the movie is enough to raise a few eyebrows and the action from the movie is accurate in a sense as it's taken from the book and was executed perfectly.<br/><br/>The material that needed improvement was that it times it falls in the category of being to shallow at times. For example in the novel, the threat of Nuclear War is in effect, yet the frightening intensity and fear is featured in the novel, but in the movie the intensity is not there. The civilians in the novel are in mass-panic and the paranoia that's manifesting in the lives of these people give it's readers the same intensity as well. But in the movie, it doesn't happen. The only characters that are scared are the superheroes and the government officials. This results in a lack-luster effort by the production because a big chunk of the plot from the novel is missing almost to the brink of being pointless. With this deadly war coming soon to a city near you, you can't just depend on an all-tiring scene where the President sits on their asses in a war room to give an emergency address across the nation. With the war on hand they're fighting to stay alive and being able to see it ourselves, we never get to feel for the civilians because we're focusing more on the war room and less on the fight. <br/><br/>The acting was in the most of it pretty droll because the intensity and the emotions in the character are very underused. The one who stood above average was the Jackie Earl Haley's character of Rorschach who was very convincing, but the characters overall don't stand out like they did in Iron Man. The portrayal of Richard Nixon is badly caricatured and the soundtrack is just as equally degrading. Who thought it would be funny to include the ""hallelujah"" song during the sex scene? Whatever! Silly to put goofy songs during tense moments is enough to make anyone cringe. Even the funeral scenes are looked as a joke, what gives? No respect for the dead?<br/><br/>Okay it's impossible to take every detail in the book and cram in all the scenes, that I understand. Sure it was very good physically and stylistically, but I was a bit disappointed with the finished product. To those who admire the work of Alan Moore it's worthy of at least one watch, but there would not be a need to see it more than that. It's a good action movie, but not counting for other tastes. The movie has missed a lot and after we're finished watching the movie we might be able to know what was missing from the novel."
"John_Truby","Null","0","4","7 January 2010"," A massive Rube Goldberg mechanism
","Mixing genres is the fundamental story technique of mainstream Hollywood movie-making. If you want to play in that league, you need to master the technique. But be warned. If you don't know what you're doing, you end up with a big mess.<br/><br/>Watchmen left me with a strong sense of missed opportunity. This movie had the potential to be another deep exploration of the role of the savior in modern American life, with a shot at reaching the heights of the best of the form, The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>The challenge facing the writers was huge. They had to weave at least three stories, each from a different genre. First is the fantasy superhero story about who these characters are, why they formed their team, and why they disbanded it. Second is the detective story where Rorschach tries to uncover who is assassinating his old superhero pals. Third is the action story where someone is out to destroy the world.<br/><br/>In putting these three genres together, the writers have created a massive Rube Goldberg mechanism that lumbers along, puffing and wheezing, pushing forward, backing up, until it finally collapses at the finish line 2 hours and 43 minutes later.<br/><br/>Watchmen is a textbook example of how to write, and not write, a superhero origin story. The origin of a superhero is often the most fun aspect of the character and is a complete story unto itself. So the writer has to figure out how to combine a fairly long origin story with a full-blown crime or disaster tale, and make both lines seem like one.<br/><br/>Batman Begins gives us a model for how to execute this job properly. There the writers begin by crosscutting Bruce Wayne's ghost as a youth (the bats and the death of his parents) with the training he receives from Henri Ducard of the League of Shadows. Then Bruce returns to Gotham to fight crime as Batman and eventually uncovers the plot to destroy the city, concocted by none other than his teacher, Henri Ducard.<br/><br/>But notice one huge advantage the Batman writers have in doing their adaptation: they have to detail the ghost of only one character. This difference is the source of all of Watchmen's structural problems. The Watchman's writers tried to provide detailed ghosts for all nine of the Watchmen superheroes. They realized putting all of these origin stories together at the beginning would create its own movie and have little to do with the assassination/world destruction plot.<br/><br/>So they tried using an advanced story structure form (which I discuss in detail in the Advanced Screen writing Class). In this form you set up a character with an intense desire line. Then at various intervals, you halt the narrative drive and you explore some dramatic issue or delve deep into character. This technique was used in both Forrest Gump and Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>This advanced storytelling form has some great strengths but also grave dangers. If you don't set up a strong enough desire line, the side trips eventually collapse the story. Similarly, if you go too often or spend too long in the side trips, your narrative drive stops. And if these side trips are about ghost - information about the past - then your narrative drive is really in trouble because you are literally going backwards.<br/><br/>All of these problems occur in Watchmen. The writers use a detective story for their desire line: Rorschach wants to find out who is killing the retired superheroes. This appears to be a good choice, since the detective form has one of the cleanest and most propulsive lines of any genre. It is also a form focused on finding out what happened in the past, usually having to do with who committed a murder. So the audience is more accepting in this form of looking backwards.<br/><br/>But the detective form has nowhere near the narrative drive needed to support this many backward looking journeys, for this many characters. And it cannot then flip to an action story line where a team defeats a supervillain who is trying to destroy the world.<br/><br/>The result is a film of three stories in which none is done well. Of the three, the most interesting by far is the story of the origin of this band of superheroes. Had the writers focused on this, they could have had a terrific film.<br/><br/>Of course all of this implies that the writers had a choice. All kinds of forces could have dictated that they somehow make the three-in-one story work. Faced with that task, you do the best job you can.<br/><br/>But whatever the reality of this film, Watchmen shows screenwriters that there are limits to how much you can hang on the narrative line. When mixing genres, the main rule is the pick one genre to be the primary one. Then be very careful how many other genre elements you hang on it. Or you'll end up with some very nasty wreckage.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"

Along with masks becoming outlawed and superheros were not longer needed to maintain order.

Not knowing any of the actors in this movie except Malin Akerman who I recently saw in ""Couples Retreat"", this movie is well acted, but most of all the graphics and the special effects are what made this movie good.

I wasn't blown away, but it looked decent, at least on HDTV.<br/><br/>But what makes it a good movie is simply that it sticks to the graphic novel, making only minor changes and relatively minor deletions. The movie is what the book is, a revisionist take on both superheroes and hard boiled detectives.<br/><br/>I did feel they softened Rorschach a little in the book; he was more the nut-job right wing vigilante in the original book, and leaving out a lot of his most odious thoughts took away a little of the moral complexity.

Any movie that can hold one's attention for 2 1/2 to 3 hours without becoming boring for one second... now that is something truly special. I was constantly engrossed and almost every scene has something edifying and thought-provoking, both in dialogue and in subtext. There are many layers and each has a purpose in the end, making for a near-perfect screenplay.<br/><br/>The cast all shine in their roles. Some people say Malin Akerman can't act, but I think she did a pretty good job in this movie. Jackie Earle Haley is perfect as Rorschach, being both menacing and darkly funny. I also loved Matthew Goode as Ozymandius, who is in many ways the tragic hero of the story. Jeffrey Dean Morgan has less screen time than the rest of the cast, but succeeds greatly in bringing to life the complexities of the Comedian. The plot is too complicated to go into, but every character is developed very well, each with their own flaws and moral ambiguity. The scenes added to the Ultimate Cut DVD also flesh out more the characters of Hollis Mason and Sally Jupiter, and the animated Tales of the Black Freighter is both frightening and symbolic, and gives a whole new angle to the inner thought process of the film.<br/><br/>Ideas like moral relativism and objectivism, determinism and nihilism are explored in a really interesting way in the development of the characters. On an entirely different level, the story is a commentary on utilitarianism and deontology. (If you don't understand these terms, I'd suggest a quick trip to Wikipedia.) The philosophical nature of the story makes it less action based and more of a character piece. It works because it has brains and heart and doesn't try to be a typical Hollywood comic book movie. The story is dense and if you can't digest it all the first time around, multiple viewings will be very rewarding.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are fantastic, and the whole film is incredibly cinematic. The computer visuals aren't perfect but they are amazing to look at, along with the cinematography inspired directly by the graphic novel. Zack Snyder's sense of style doesn't go into CGI overload like Sin City or even 300, but keeps things fairly realistic and balanced. They also use a very unique color palette that brings a natural mood to the sets, like a perfect mixture of reality and fantasy. There is a lot of slo-mo but it all works to add tension to the fight scenes. The soundtrack is great as well, with classics like The Sound of Silence and 99 Red Balloons making each scene resonate as if the film had a beating heart.<br/><br/>Sometimes good isn't good, and evil isn't evil. Passion and judgement can be destructive, and maybe having enemies keeps us sane. Goodness can come out of chaos, and failure can be victory. The ends may justify the means, but only if you believe that there is an 'end'. I love this film because there's so many messages and so much to think about, that you can watch it again and again and see new things each time. And most importantly, I understood it without knowing much about the comics.<br/><br/>I recently read the comic, and although the film is just slightly less thought-provoking, Snyder did an incredibly faithful job of adapting the characters, themes and settings into a concise but still deep package. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job with this material."
"DQGladstone","Null","0","1","27 September 2009"," Be sober and watch...
","I did read ""Watchmen"" when it first came out but I wasn't amazingly impressed by it. Best ""graphic novel"" of all time? Really? I may have been too young to appreciate it, 22 or so. <br/><br/>(I'm re-reading it now and it really is ground-breaking. I WAS too young or stupid.)<br/><br/>In the comic, there was more of an emphasis on ""The End Is Near"" doom-sayers in the streets with only one example in the film, the billboard that the unmasked Rorschach carries. OK, 2 examples.<br/><br/>To me, the movie came off as a superhero soap opera with some dark moments and bone-crunching. Rorshach and The Comedian were dark and driven and gave good performances.<br/><br/>There seemed a huge contradiction at the end where Doc Manhattan acknowledged that he couldn't change human nature but that if no one told the truth about the nuclear event, peace would reign. Depending on your point of view, war is in the hands of mankind, God or the gods and presumably, if human nature doesn't change then we can expect war to pick up again after everyone catches their collective breath. World peace is a pipe dream and if Doc Manhattan buys it, he's not too bright.<br/><br/>Since the ax I like to grind is male/female relationships and the lies we tell ourselves re: that subject, I have to say I was astounded by the fight/rape scene between the Comedian and Miss Jupiter. He says ""yes"", she says ""no"" and gives him a powerful sock to the jaw with all the usual Hollywood sound-effects. He falls to the ground. In any other film, he'd get up, say ""...but, BAbydoll.."", rub his jaw and walk out angrily. Not here.<br/><br/>The Comedian punches her in the stomach, gets up and hits her twice (?) in the face, HARD, kicks her while she's down then picks up her up, slams her into a pool table and smashes her face on the table.<br/><br/>Huh? Life is complex and I'm not an advocate of easy solutions. I don't believe in male violence against women or female violence against men. Both genders are violent, stupid and emotional and men are usually stronger.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I was astounded to see a scene in a Hollywood film where a woman strikes the first blow, as is often the case, and the man gets up and beats the crap out of her. Do I advocate it? No. But, here in this fantasy film, we are seeing more realism than all the other idiotic films where a woman hits a man, knocks him down and he gets up and apologizes to her.<br/><br/>A woman hits a man and a man hits her back, beating her up! A Hollywood revelation! THEN, we find out that she has sex with him years later, consensual presumably, that they conceive a child and that the Comedian has warm feelings for the grown-up daughter, which the aging, possibly jealous, wife attacks as sexual when they probably aren't. (There are also about 214 visual cues that the Comedian is in love with Miss Jupiter but doesn't express it very well.)<br/><br/>A rape scene where a woman gets beat up followed years later by consensual sex.<br/><br/>THEN, Miss Jupiter graces us with the well-observed revelation that ""...the future keeps getting darker while the past, even the grimy parts, get lighter."" She then feeds us the pap that she's thankful for the Comedian for giving her a daughter but there's no acknowledgment of why she went to a man who tried to rape her to conceive that daughter.<br/><br/>The message here is undesirable but clear. Miss Jupiter is sexually intrigued by the Comedian because of, or despite, his violence. When she hit him in the rape scene she probably got more in return than she bargained for but, if it's reasonable for her to hit him, it's reasonable that he'll hit her back and defeat her.<br/><br/>Is the Comedian a good guy? Well, he may be an anti-hero, a sign of the times but he's no hero. The pregnant Vietnamese woman rips his face with a beer bottle and he kills her. Was it a reasonable reaction on his part? No. Was it a reasonable ACTION on her part? No, it was a stupid action and she paid the ultimate price.<br/><br/>Hollywood owes me an apology for making me thankful for a scene where a woman hits a man (Miss Jupiter) and he actually HITS HER BACK. It's DARK, it's SCARY but it's realism.<br/><br/>You can't cry out for the end of domestic violence while female characters in Hollywood are knocking out men with a right hook. What kind of message does THAT send?"
"andrewhanrattymullan","5","0","3","18 September 2009"," pretty good movie, until the ending.
","This review is going to be practically impossible to give reasons of my opinions without giving spoilers, so tread carefully. Right off the bat, I'll complain about the ending. Replacing the giant squid with Dr. Manhattan does not make sense. The whole point was for the huge threat to be unknown, and not associated with either the Americans or the Soviets. Dr. Manhattan however, is known and is typically associated with America. And thus the Soviets would probably blame the American government of losing control of him. The countries aren't ""unified and pacified"". Also, since they know Dr. Manhattan's energy signature, they could have traced his location to the North Pole and attack (they should be able to trace him, as Silk Spectre says that he was on Mars). It just doesn't make sense, particularly when they keep in the fact that he left for another galaxy. Moving away from the ending, another problem was the origins they told for the characters. They just didn't focus on them, as barely important scenes. Dr. Manhattan, whilst his lines were impressive (good job, Hayter) they just weren't delivered well with the actor's tone of voice. Malin Akerman was just wooden, although she did seem as though she was trying. Some stuff like their jab at George W. Bush was just unnecessary, I admit he's a moron but he's out of office, it's old news. They called themselves the Watchmen which they never did in the graphic novel, it's supposed to be ambiguous. Snyder brought the action up too much. The slow-motion was annoying, the fighting was just dancing and the scene where Rorschach jumped out of the window and continued fighting was just ridiculous. They made Ozymandias seem too much like a villain, giving him an evil glare and look like Draco Malfoy from Harry Potter. And why keep in the genetically created tiger? It's a set-up for the squid, so why keep that in? Enough complaints, time for good stuff. Rorschach and Comedian were really well portrayed by their actors, sounded just like I imagined they would. The opening credits were a really good way to show the alternate history of Watchmen. At first I thought they pushed the symbolism with the doomsday clock too much, but for a film it's appropriate. The glass fortress Manhattan made actually looked better than the graphic novel's, with the whole clock thing. Overall, this is just an okay movie. Would've been a 6 or 7 if it wasn't for the ending."
"maatmouse-1","7","0","1","8 September 2009"," Far more adult fare than the traditional 'superhero' stuff
","Over the last few months there has been enormous hype about the film adaption of Alan Moore's graphic novel 'Watchmen'. Like V for Vendetta, I have never read Watchmen but I was curious about it, having enjoyed the satire of V for Vendetta. It is a pity that Moore refuses to claim credits for either film adaptation as neither are particularly bad films.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of superhero type movies, Watchmen has an intelligent subtext and alternative reality. Set in the 1980s in America, Nixon is still President and it is long before Reagan gets a look-in. America is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia as the cold war bites and there is great unease and lawlessness within American society. Out of this, comes the character Rorschah, with a voice like gravel, charting the death of superhero 'the comedian', a character of incredible sadism, despatched by an unknown assassin. Rorschah's investigations, like some masked Phil Marlowe, lead him to dig out the past of fellow superheros 'Nite Owl II', Silk Spectre II, Ozymandias and Dr Manhattan. Of the group, only the latter, Dr Manhattan, is in possession of incredible superpowers, having suffered a scientific experiment which went (in usual superhero style) horribly wrong. Now John Osterman is pretty much indestructible and capable of superman type behaviour, also glowing a rather cold shade of blue and possessing a voice like HAL from 2001. It is clear in the film that both Rorschah and Manhattan are cut of the same cloth, both struggling with society and its problems and their own grievances with it. Yet whereas Rorschah chooses to try and ignore society, Manhattan struggles to fit in.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of superhero movies, there is little less action in this. There is a whole lot of plot and back story, particularly about Manhattan and how he came to be as he is and Silk Spectre II or Laurie Jupiter and her difficult relationship with her mother. Laurie is also struggling with John/Manhattan's moods as well and trying to be his lover, although he doesn't make it much of a priority. Again, unlike so many superhero movies which deal in a more childish world, Watchmen is unafraid of sex and depicting some sex and male/female nudity, a rare departure from films of this genre. Dan (Nite Owl II) and Laurie are seen enjoying each other after the rescue of some families from a burning building and Laurie is also seen earlier being 'pleasured' by Manhattan. The film also contains the most inventive use of Leonard Cohen's song 'Hallelujah' when it is being played as Dan and Laurie are having sex in Dan's superhero vehicle.<br/><br/>Where this film really stands out is that there is no clear supervillian, as in real life. There are just lots of questions. My only grumble of this film is that there is little opportunity for Ozymandias' character to fully come out. He is portrayed as two dimensional and quite cold. There is much to recommend this film. It has a fearless portrayal of alternative sexual relationships, such as lesbianism and it doesn't shy away from nudity, particularly male nudity."
"insomniac_rod","9","0","2","7 September 2009"," Spectacular and dark. The Anti-Super Hero concept redefines the genre.
","""Watchmen"" is by far the darkest super-hero movie released. I use the term ""dark"" because it deals with not so common topics in these kind of movies such as super heroes retiring, getting killed, political ambitions with real-life situations and characters, extreme violence (for Hollywood's standards=, raping, and more...<br/><br/>I really tried to like this movie a lot and I can say I only enjoyed it big time because of it's spectacular, stupendous f/x. But I couldn't take it seriously mainly because it keeps ""that"" comic-book style vibe. I mean, it's a graphic novel but when you take events and characters into a movie, some of those elements just feel out of place. But that's my opinion.<br/><br/>The fact that the superheroes are not 100% good and even deal with evil and violent situations, gives you an idea of how critic and real the movie tries to be.<br/><br/>You can't say something negative about it's production values. This is a perfect movie on that matter. The f/x are extremely well done; it's like a parallel world of darkness and technology. The political sub-plot sometimes fell out of place taking in account the current world events that deal with it. But I keep in mind that it's a graphic novel with a defined plot.<br/><br/>The action sequences are great, spectacular, and rely a lot on violence and fighting techniques. Gore is glorious when has on screen opportunities.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes include a giant Dr. Manhattan ""solving"" the situation in Vietnam, The Comedian's demise, the maximum security prison escape, and the epic ending where Egyptian culture takes an important role...<br/><br/>The acting is also very good and taken seriously. Malin Akerman is truly hot as hell! What a PERFECT big ass, and I thank her for that steamy sex scene inside ""Archie"". The Comedian and Rorshchach were by far my favorite characters. You can't get more badass than them.<br/><br/>This should be a new contender for best action movie in years because it offers new elements that should redefine epic cinema.<br/><br/>But keep in mind that this should be considered as violent popcorn fun."
"shaw-simon","7","0","3","6 September 2009"," Awesome
","I think the best praise I can give the Watchmen is that I came away feeling as though I'd watched something very different. Super hero movies were in a funk: Spidrman was played awfully safe, Batman has been turned into a stuffy bore, the less said about X-Men the better - the world needed The Watchmen! It has relevance and topicality, intelligence as well as action and the soundtrack kicks all ass. So why not a 10? Well although it is a very faithful adaptation, I think it could have been even more so and I'm greatly looking forward to the directors cut. I'd previously read about the sex scenes, and though I didn't find them to be completely unnecessary, they just didn't fit the tone and as such they do seem a little 'wrong'. Minor gripes aside, The Watchmen is all over fantastic!"
"doctorx2","9","0","2","4 September 2009"," Overscrutinized
","IMDb's extensive list of ""Goofs/Incorrectly Regarded as Goofs,"" fact-checking, trivia, and other information people have contributed regarding ""Watchmen"" gives you only a fractional idea of how intensely this film was anticipated and scrutinized by fans of the Alan Moore/Dave Gibbons graphic novel.<br/><br/>Unlike the other superhero movies of the last ten years, ""Watchmen"" is based on unpopular, unconventional, one-shot superheroes created by Moore specifically for his dark think piece on humanity, ethics, and obsession. Zack Snyder made the film with the same faithfulness to the source material that he brought to Frank Miller's ""300,"" often using the frames of the graphic novel for his story board. For fans of the graphic novel, it is accordingly something of a dream come true...<br/><br/>EXCEPT -- that as he did with ""300,"" Snyder oddly chooses to alter the story. Some abridgment of ""Watchmen"" was expected -- e.g., ""Tales of the Black Freighter,"" the brilliantly parallel story-within-a-story, is omitted in the interest of saving time (although for fans, it is available separately on DVD). However, changing Veidt's plan from a fake alien invasion to making Dr. Manhattan look like a threat to humanity is a big change. I'm not sure it is a bad change; in many ways, it makes for a leaner and more clever story, which better explains Dr. Manhattan's decision to leave Earth at the end of the film. But it is a change.<br/><br/>Changes like this and the commercial fervor over the film no doubt induced Alan Moore to forswear the project, which is a pity, as it is his brainchild.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is a masterpiece. The effects are impressive, and very much the way I imagined them when I first read the graphic novel. The appearance of New York City, Mars, Veidt's fortress, and the Owlship are wonderfully true to the source material. Dr. Manhattan looks as he should. The changes in costumes make Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II look more convincing. Rorschach's mask works as advertised.<br/><br/>The acting was consistently impressive: Patrick Wilson's defeated Dreiberg, Matthew Goode's controlled Ozymandias, Jeffrey Dean Morgan's complex and disturbing Comedian, Billy Crudup's wonderfully detached Dr. Manhattan, Carla Gugino and Stephen McHattie's world-weary retired crimefighters, and of course, James Earl Haley's tour de force as Rorschach -- especially during the prison sequence. The supporting cast also gives strong performances, including those by Rob LaBelle (Wally Weaver) and long-time favorites Matt Frewer (as Moloch) and Danny Woodburn (as Big Figure). Malin Akerman does her best work to date as Laurie/Silk Spectre II.<br/><br/>As a fan of the novel, I was riveted by the film, and would strongly recommend it to anyone who read ""Watchmen."" On the other hand, I imagine the film is almost incomprehensible to anyone unfamiliar with the graphic novel. It is also (like ""300"") geared for young adults and geeky middle-aged men (like me) -- middle-aged women will never get past the opening scene (the Comedian's demise). If you are a married man over 30 and want to watch ""Watchmen"" at home, I recommend that you also rent a Jane Austen adaptation or Meryl Streep film for your wife to watch in the other room. You will both be a lot happier."

","Watchmen I saw watchmen the day it came out i have to say it is a very beautiful movie and a very Entertaining movie. But was it a good movie? Yes it was a very good movie the story was changed from the original book a tiny bit. But nothing to freak out but Malin akreman was awuful just a little complaint. The music some people thought was awkward but I loved the music. Jackie Earle Haley was fantastic as Rorsach so all and all. Watchmen is a great movie and an even better graphic novel so if you haven't read the book read it I've read it two times or see the movie it doesn't matter you'll enjoy every second of each one. 8 out of 10 WATCHMEN.

","I never heard of the Watchmen before this so I went in with a clean slate.<br/><br/>The GOOD: Enough fight scenes to keep it interesting; more story here than most action movies.<br/><br/>The BAD: The costumes for these superheroes are downright laughable; there are at least three sex scenes thrown in for no real good reason (guess Spectre's daughter is as much a tramp as her mom was); deep plot can get confusing fast - you'll need the 3hrs to watch the movie and another 6 days to dissect it all; why do mobs of villains still attack one at a time? (reference to the prison riot scene); sometimes the violence is just too over the top and totally unnecessary; the digital blood is lame - but Hollywood hasn't figured that out since it released V For Vendetta; drags at times; too long for its own good.<br/><br/>Overall, I was left with the feeling that I really didn't ""get"" the love affair people have with the Watchmen - the ""stellar"" posts you see here are probably fans of the graphic novel banding together to keep its rating high (just doing my part to bring its rating down some here). It's an ""okay"" movie but you'd be hard-pressed to tell a friend why they should see it or describe its plot to your blind Grandma."
"MVictorPjinsiste","7","0","1","26 August 2009"," Who Watches The Watchmen?
","This is a good film, that could have been greater.<br/><br/>Snyder is known to make faithful film adaptations of eclectic comics, but in this one, he falls a little short; he was lost in the details, and when that happens, you usually lose the bigger picture.<br/><br/>It reflects on the rhythm of his movie; sometime it is so hashed-out it could have been edited by Uwe Boll. There are film noir excerpts, told in the first person by Rorschach and third-person viewpoints and flashbacks, which gives the film the feeling of too many hands at work.<br/><br/>The aspect that distracted me most was the use of obvious musical scores without any relevance here and there in the movie. If I can accept Dylan's ""The Times They Are A Changing"" in the opening credits while past history is showcased, I had troubles with the same old, same old hippie classics like ""All Along The Watchtower"" and ""The Sound of Silence"" (the later one being played at the funerals of a guy for which few had any sympathy to this point), which had no relevance whatsoever in a film which takes place in the 80s, apart from being well-known hits that would make people in the viewing room go ""Hey! Cool!"" and ""Alright!"" when they hear it. The use of Apocalypse Now's Ride of the Valkyries during the Vietnam part was especially pathetic.<br/><br/>Yet during other parts, like in Dr. Manhattan's story, the music (in this case, Phillip Glass') merged with what was on screen with complete osmosis, creating a little masterpiece that could have had a life of its own. You get a impression of godlike omni-potency, and yet also of hopeless solitude when experiencing it. The best part of the movie IMO, and the only one who measures up to 300's lavish style.<br/><br/>The actors give acceptable performances, the best ones being delivered by Haley and Morgan in interpreting Rorschach and the Comedian, respectively. Gugino's tiny appearance lit up the screen as a very credible 40s pin-up, and Akerman was a treat for the eyes, although about any Hollywood starlet could have done as good given the thin character.<br/><br/>The camera work is good, but is being hampered by Snyder's strict observance of the original novel's layouts; As much as it worked in 300, the passage here from paper to film is more debatable.<br/><br/>Too much have been written about Dr. Manhattan's genitalia, a most hypocrite reaction when compared to the explicit violence and gore that pockmarks the film -and which is absent from the novel, BTW. Well, it's about as erotic as your average secondary school biology manual. Half of the inhabitants of the Earth's got a penis, people. Don't make such a fuss about it. Beside, we see much more of Akerman's zones than Dr. Manhattan's CGI ones, anyway (which isn't unpleasant).<br/><br/>The history (which I won't recapitulate here) is, of course, of the first order, but suffers from the lack of rhythm that comes from the difference between the medias.<br/><br/>In the end, Watchmen is a movie that will make its audience think, much more than 300; it isn't just a dumb summer flick filled with explosions, but a philosophical movie draped in capes and masks."

"mike_bel","7","0","3","23 August 2009"," A nice illustration for a great book
","If you are going to make a movie based on a great novel which you love you have two ways to go. First, you can try to follow the text as close as you can and create an illustration. This is what Zack Snyder has done in Watchmen. There is also another way, which is to recreate everything from zero and push beyond the limits of the original. A very risky approach which the fans would most likely condemn. Andrei Tarkovsky did it with the Roadside Picknick (a great science fiction novel by Strugatsky brothers) to create his Stalker. And this is to me the main difference: In Stalker we have an ingenious new creation while Watchmen is only a perfect illustration. <br/><br/>After saying all this I can mention that Snyder's picture is of a very high quality, the acting is very good (especially, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl), and the soundtrack is quite extraordinary.

So, the whole spectacle became more or less lackluster over time. <br/><br/>You can put a comic-book aside, if there's something you must digest, but ""Watchmen"" just keeps on punching the uncovered parts.

"jimjo1216","Null","0","2","4 August 2009"," Great...for a comic book movie (and NOT a family-friendly action flick)
","Not a great ""film"", per se, but a very good comic book movie. Not fun and exciting, but dark and bada**. WATCHMEN explores the darker side of superheroes. Who they are, why they do what they do. Their histories, their faults, their inner demons.<br/><br/>Rated R, there's bloody violence, sexual conduct, nudity, explicit language, disturbing imagery, and everything else. Definitely not for kids.<br/><br/>Having read the source material, I can say that this is a very faithful adaptation, as adaptations go. They took the story right out of the graphic novel and did their best to shape it into a movie. Some details were tweaked, but the big picture remains intact and some very specific details and images are preserved for the fans.<br/><br/>The movie is a nice escape, taking viewers into a self-contained universe of costumed heroes and exotic settings. People unfamiliar with the comic may be hesitant to see a film with such ""unknown"" characters, but I think it would be fun immersing oneself into this very unique universe.<br/><br/>The action tends to be a bit too stylized and graphic for my tastes, and the soundtrack is curious. Though carefully selected from the book, the songs often seem like an odd hodgepodge of retro tunes, feeling weird on top of the gritty visuals.<br/><br/>But WATCHMEN takes comic book action movies to a place they've never gone before. And though the film will never win any awards, it is an intriguing new take on the cape-and-cowl crowd and a great ride.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>I think the overwhelming backlash to this movie stems from misplaced expectations. This is NOT a superhero action movie like SPIDER-MAN or IRON MAN or X-MEN, and it was not ever meant to be. Maybe the marketing is to blame.<br/><br/>WATCHMEN is based on a cynical and philosophical comic series for adults. No children should see this film. It's not that kind of movie. And the brutal scenes are taken right from the comic. <br/><br/>I can understand complaints about the length (nearly 3 hours) and I can understand the plot being confusing to people who left the theater after 1 hour, but I think there's enough in the film to make it make a certain amount of sense. Reading the book should help people who wouldn't otherwise understand the movie. Repeated viewings might also help.<br/><br/>This type of movie might not be your cup of tea, and that's fine. But you should be aware of what kind of movie WATCHMEN is. Do not expect a fun superhero/sci-fi action flick. Don't let the costumes fool you. And don't sit down on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn for Family Movie Night. This is a film for adults only. It's rated-R, after all.<br/><br/>Just know what you're getting into before you pop in this movie."
"honorhorror","8","0","2","1 August 2009"," Very original presentation of an ambitious but inconsistent story.
","Suppose you see a rarely good comic-based movie like Watchmen, would you directly wish it make it to the top 250? I did, but I only give it an 8 for its inconsistency.<br/><br/>I am not professional and it didn't take a professor in cinema to appreciate the efforts they put in this movie. The film's nostalgic style were flowing everywhere and saturated the heroes' stories and memories as well. The first 1hr 30 minutes in the extended version was so unforgivably good that everyone in the Watchmen team were as much explored and the story went on to make sense. Fighting sequences reflected the style they did in 300, which blends Matrix in a comics context, where the slums/country musics/Beatles all catch you and shock you. Cameras always assure you of the subtlety behind those funny suits, which gave me a totally different feeling than the trailer, which I mush criticize on. The public of course are willing to see another comic hero movie with all those funny suits. That must have been the publisher's idea. However, Watchmen is not about fist-fighting, it's about history changing people. So if the trailer could be a bit more nostalgic and dramatically-implying, the movie would make a lot more money. It's too dark but I am sure you can handle that after The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>What I meant by inconsistency, is not as severe as those movies like Punisher the war-zone or so. The problem is the forced-up climax and conclusion. It's a little forced for all the audiences to see the real motives of Ozimandias and to accept his holocaust treatment that supposedly solved the conflicts between Soviet Union and USA. The message ""who will watch the watchmen"" was beautifully delivered with the experience of all the superheroes portrayed, but fell short of realistic touch, which was like a gem in the first half. To show the difference between Rorschach and Night-owl, the director intentionally killed Rorschach using Dr. Manhattan. This is to show how the powerful people bend the worldly rules, which even worked for a semi-god like Dr. Manhattan. Still this could be very rigid that Dr. Manhattan's motives would seem manipulated. Yet, Ozymandias was too confident in making all the moves and all the watchmen in the final scene became like retarded-men who didn't think twice. Rorschach's journal should be a good lead for a sequel but the scale, the spectacular and the phenomenon will need much more efforts...... Again, Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II wasn't explored enough and the audiences didn't feel much of her feeling knowing the Comedian was her father or so, which makes the ending even more ridiculous.<br/><br/>Well, the director was talented, some scenes, specially those tragic moments were most memorable. However, the inconsistency should really be fixed by more patience.<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked it. 8/10"

","Any film which has two far less one song from Leonard Cohen is bound to be cool. ""First We Take Manhattan"" and ""Hallelujah""... I only read the first six books of the Watchmen in my teens, so I knew enough that for my part Zack Snyder did a fair job of almost slavishly following the book except to the endgame as far as I know. Even so, he created a rightful alternate which should keep fans wanting more...<br/><br/>After all, what will happen with NiteOwl II and Miss Jupiter (Silk Spectre II)?? I didn't see any condoms and therefore is it that far off to imagine a next generation? I am sure even Leonard Cohen would have a great snicker as to how his ""Hallelujah"" would be used - as I am sure like Prince, both see God and sex as closely related or different millings along the edge of the same coin.<br/><br/>Dr Manhattan spoke of creating life in another galaxy what will this do to that Universe? Were there aliens already there or is that version like Asimov and Campbell's Universe? Stark and human-solo until Dr Manhattan's proposed project? In a weird and very real sense, Ozymandias brought sanity to a world long since bereft of it... The Comedian and Rorshach were fully aware of it and had different operating mechanisms for it. Rorshach did not cope, nor accept - he just had no illusions that the world and himself were insane, in fact insanity gave him lucidity.<br/><br/>Edward Blake, never denied his brutal nature and thrived on it and made it his tool to survive when metahumans were outlawed. It is intriguing how since this series in 1986 that everyone who's sought to conceptualise genuine ultra-normals in a present day situation have all chosen an entropic outcome with political overtones...<br/><br/>""Kingdom Come"" also DC, the novels ""Those Who Walk In Darkness"" and ""What Fire Cannot Burn"" from John Ridley - even Pixar/Disney's ""Incredibles"" follows that trend as well as Michael Rappaport while his parking attendant character is on Experimental Meds and thinks he's super-powered.<br/><br/>By far, Rorshach was the most captivating character in this film and probably the most genuine hero. He refused to surrender his ideals even in the face of annihilation and thus proved the true definition of heroics. He also had the best line in the movie and it summed up his ethos too; ""I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with ME!"" Manhattan was not necessarily remote, his mechanism to handle the resultant ripples from his re-entry was to adopt stereotypy but was forced to snap out of it when confronted with another unexpected hero - Miss Jupiter, who rose above her semi-tragic childhood unlike Rorshach who embraced his dark young days and used it as fuel to drive him onwards.<br/><br/>Hollis Mason - the original NiteOwl and Miss Jupiter's mom the first Silk Spectre, the two surviving MinuteMen both tried coping with the New Wave in pretty much the same way - reliving the past and reinforced with booze.<br/><br/>The direction was great, Matt Frewer as a devolving ex-villain was sad yet humorous, Billy Crudup is a far cry from 2003's ""Big Fish,"" and there was credible acting all around except maybe for Ozymandias who was a little too hammy yet maybe that was needed to expose his delusions? It will be remarkable if there's a sequel, and would lead to a next conundrum... Who watches out for those who watch the Watchmen?"
"Kassdhal","7","0","1","27 July 2009"," Relatively close to the original scenario but...
","While most of the original scenario is still there, this movie has two significant drawbacks. The first one is of course Matthew Goode, who lacks the charisma and presence required for such a key character as Ozymandias. It is unbelievable that there has been such an error in casting. I don't say Goode is a bad actor, just that he cannot impersonate Veidt. Also, the part about the origin and the past of Veidt/Ozymandias are weak compared to the weight they bring in the comic. The second is the chosen end, that differs from the original book and, in my opinion, is much weaker. Except for that, the movie stays relatively true to the impressive original scenario..."

"colour-me-kubrick","Null","0","1","16 July 2009"," Mission impossible
","Not just the task of the Watchmen superheroes trying to prevent World War III, but also Zack Snyder who was trying to translate to film the only comic book that I can recall which was a masterpiece in literary terms . Needless to say I had very low expectations, since the previous adaptation of the same director 300 was reduced to a simplistic visually arousing film with no heart. But Watchmen is like no other comic book, its mythology and philosophy is not as abstract. It is based during the cold war when most of these moral questions were being asked, when absurd ideas and abstract notions were being put forth.<br/><br/>Now that I have underlined by initial apprehensions, let me assess how the movie faired in the wake of it. It did exceed my expectations to a large extent. The movie is visually stunning and captures the essence. Snyder got the tone right. It is not an upbeat story by any stretch of imagination. It is a story of superheroes in all their weakness and loneliness, in their anguish and disconnect with the people and establishment they are supposed to defend, in their pursuit for a normal life in an abnormal world.<br/><br/>For me the only thing that definitely didn't work was the casting. These are powerful characters written. I need some powerhouse actors to perform instead we get a bunch of efficient actors who don't do a bad job, but none of them stand out. Snyder is clearly not one looking for nuance in performance, more concerned of the look of the film. It is a tough movie to make, since the narrative will take its time, there will be intermittent flashbacks, so the audience might get restless. Snyder tries to infuse some life in the relatively dull moments with some soundtracks. Some of which fit perfectly others don't.<br/><br/>Please the rabid comic fan boys, please the large theater audience, it was a tough job. I think he struck the right balance tilting towards the latter. It is not an envious job. Watchmen as a multi layered comic book is very difficult to adapt to a film with the time constraints, maybe series might be more feasible.<br/><br/>ONE POINT:- Do you need to read the book to watch the movie? No, in fact, if anything reading the book hampers your attentiveness and involvement withing the film."
"voss76","7","0","2","14 July 2009"," Not terrible.
","First off I'm in the ""has read book, dreaded the movie"" category but after finally watching the ""watchmen"" I can honestly say it was not terrible. I wont get into nitpicking about things that were left out or changes from the original material but will simply leave it by saying it was a faithful adaptation of the source. <br/><br/>That being said, Id like to put out there a few thoughts on the whole lead up to this film and the resistance in it being made. Those familiar with the history behind the potential of having this material made into a feature film know all to well the story of the original director who was tagged to make it's story. In a nutshell Terry Gilliam claimed that it was ""unfilmable"" except for maybe as a 10 part miniseries or something to that effect. In this I both agree and disagree. I believe it was Gilliam's feeling that something so rich and beautiful as the original graphic novel shouldn't be the victim of any sort of dumbing down or compromise. And that he was possibly afraid of the filmed material being tossed onto the bargain bin of film history. However I believe that the source could have been filmed given the right hands to craft it. Was Snyder the right man for the job? I don't know.. Nor do I think its a relevant point. Any director would have tried to place his/her spin on it.. as that is what directors do and get paid for. It was inevitable that the thing would have been shot as motion picture, Im pleased and satisfied that it was handled appropriately.<br/><br/>The feeling of having the piece lose its vibrancy and pertinence is a sentiment that I believe all of the original fans share. It was never about not filming ""the watchmen"" but more about having it not relegated to share the same shelf space in the sci-fi section as battlefield earth. The result, made by Snyder and co. unfortunately will not be a part of film history but hopefully in my opinion simply a stepping stone into discovering the wonderful piece of art that is the graphic novel. <br/><br/>It is faithful and yet lacking.. this missing element i hope will lead new people to the original source."
"anchorman360","7","0","3","13 July 2009"," Why is there so much hate?
","This has to be one of the most mixed reviewed movies of all time along with Passion of the Christ and Snyder's own 300. I really loved watching this and didn't really get bored even though it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long. Jackie Earle Haley's Roarshach was one of the most bad ass characters that I have ever seen in a movie. He was definitely the best part of the movie and all his scenes get your attention. I thought that Billy Crudup made Dr. Manhattan a very interesting character, Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl was also very interesting as was Matthew Goode as Ozy, and Morgan was perfect as The Comedian who was the most unlikeable ""hero"" ever in a movie. A lot of people think Ackerman was terrible and while she wasn't very good she was OK. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead and thought 300 was alright but this is snyder's best movie so far and everyone should see it just because it's such a cool looking movie and Roarshach deserves his own movie."
"ellieforpeace","8","0","3","12 July 2009"," If Watchmen weren't the best graphic novel, then Watchmen, the movie, might have been a much better movie.
","Watchmen was, without a doubt, the most anticipated movie of the year. It's a bit of a shame that it came out in the third month of the year, but still, it doesn't reflect on the movie. i guess they figured the fanboys and the rated R crowd would come whenever the movie did. And I'm sure they did.<br/><br/>We arrived at the movie forty-five minutes before the start because we weren't really planning on arriving at a certain showing. We went ahead and bought the tickets, and were going to go to a bookstore, when we noticed a line. The line for Watchmen in IMAX. So we stood in line for about twenty-five minutes, and they let us in twenty minutes before the movie. We managed to get a decent seat, but nothing choice. That's how many people were there over forty-five minutes before the start. There were six trailers attached to it.<br/><br/>The movie, for those unacquainted with the graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons, is about a group of ""costumed heroes"" after their forced retirement in an alternative 1985. The graphic novel is a rumination primarily on the concept of superheroes and comic books, but the movie focuses more on the whole cold war mythology, and how the superheroes interact with that.<br/><br/>For those unacquainted with the graphic novel, well, it depends on what you're looking for as to what you will find when you watch this. Action, well you probably won't be too happy. It's less than the Dark Knight and it's just as long. A great movie... eh, I really don't think not so much. A story, then you might be satisfied.<br/><br/>For those who love the graphic novel, you should be pleased. It's exactly like watching the book come alive. It's almost exactly the same. Any changes are made completely in the spirit of the original source. It's very visual, and, well, it just feels like a graphic novel.<br/><br/>And yet, I think that may be its flaw. I believe that this is the best movie that could be made of Watchmen staying true to the graphic novel. But I don't think that the graphic novel makes a great movie when taken faithfully. I think it needs to be changed, formed, cut, and then it can be a truly great and amazing movie, like The Dark Knight did. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think there should be a prequel, back before the Keene (sp?) act and perhaps leading up to it. It was just too fun watching these amazing characters fight or have sex or just do this awesome things. I think that could be a great movie. Because that's something that movies are good at. Graphic novels are great for plot over visuals, movies are better when they fall on the visual side over the plot. Sin City is a great example. The comics were pretty good. The movie was a great movie. They were basically the same. If Watchmen wasn't the best graphic novel ever, it might have made the best movie ever, if that logic can be followed.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses aren't spectacular all the time, but it works in context. Though when stills of them were shown, I was a bit upset at how different they appeared, they completely become these characters on screen. Zack Snyder competently directs, but his penchant for slow motion can get annoying when not used correctly. But overall the movie is solid and has very striking visuals. It is a very visual movie.<br/><br/>I like the movie. I think the director's cut with the subplot of The Black Freighter spliced in will be spectacular. I am a fangirl, after all. Fans will love it (unless they're upset over the ending change) and I think apart from fanhood it's just a good solid movie."
"Grotesque_Sphinx","7","0","1","12 July 2009"," Watcmen is impossible to film
","I'm a big fan of the graphic novel. At first I had a doubt that Watchmen won't turn up to be a great big screen adaptation. After I watched it, I thought it was pretty decent. There are 12 chapters in the novel. Each chapter gives a detailed exploration about each character and their parts in the bigger plot, as well as the point of views from other supporting characters.<br/><br/>I know it would be very difficult to translate the complexity of the book into the film, but the film itself wasn't that bad. The storytelling way in the film was a bit messy because there were so many parts of the book that were cut from the film. Those parts actually held the connection between each sub-plot tighter. And of course there weren't an in depth approach to each of the character. Leaving their personalities to be floating on the screen.<br/><br/>But it was still enjoyable to watch, with great special effect, fighting scenes, and definitely the soundtracks."

Like most movies featuring a large group of main characters, the diverse story lines mixed together make it hard to 'get involved'. This movie doesn't pamper its audience with snappy one-liners and stale clichÃ©s: You really have to work to keep up. And don't count on many comic reliefs to ease the ever-building gritty tension either.<br/><br/>This is not a popcorn movie to watch with your kids or your talkative better half.

"TanQ","8","0","3","9 July 2009"," Watchmen? Watch people.
","First thing I want to say is that I usually cut movies made from comic books a lot of slack. That's usually because the source material is pretty thin and filled with archetypes and lazy writing. I'd also like to point out that the last comic book I'd seriously read was when I was eleven so the genre may have changed (although recent peeks into ones I've found in barber shops haven't really supported this). So I have never read Watchmen and likely won't in the future.<br/><br/>When I started watching the film, though, I was impressed. The characters were fleshed out, the alternate past was thoughtfully developed and the story kept me guessing exactly who the villain was. Not being a fan of the comic book also left me the joy of learning who the heroes were, as well. I found their motivations to be intriguing and their super-powers, thankfully, understated.<br/><br/>The film has, at it's core, a murder mystery which launches the characters into action towards a climax that is both unexpected and satisfying. You find yourself caring about the characters because they are flawed and, in many cases, middle-aged and struck with adult problems. This isn't a story about a teen hero learning the complexities of adult life - like the Spiderman series, nor is it a story filled with artificial darkness and unrealistic angst like the current Batman revival (yes, Bruce, your parents were murdered. get some counseling already, you can afford it), instead it's a story where adults are dealing with the decisions and actions of their lives.<br/><br/>Watchmen is surprisingly complex and well thought out. I can only hope it attracts a mature audience because only they would truly appreciate the subtleties in the story. That being said, on to the special effects.<br/><br/>In one word, beautiful. They're not overstated because they don't need to be. You're delivered rich colour palettes and a chance to actually enjoy them. Unlike the Transformer series, which prefers to sacrifice a good view of the action for meaningless close-ups of dust and machine parts, Watchmen lets you savour the scene. You get to see everything in stunning detail.<br/><br/>The most visually striking characters are the tormented Rorschach and the god-like Dr. Manhattan. In many ways, the characters are foils of each other. Rorschach, always masked, dark and simmering and Manhattan glowing cold blue and often naked. They provide two contrasting points of view. One wrapped in grit seeing only the worst around him while the other seemingly exposing everything about himself in a selfless drive to better the planet. But, like nearly everything in this film, this is an illusion. Manhattan and Rorschach prove to be the most complex characters in the film.<br/><br/>I won't say anything more about Watchmen other than I hope no one ever tries to make a sequel, it's too much of a joy to experience on it's own. There really is only one champagne - a sequel would just be another sparkling white wine. Instead, I'll just say if you're going to watch one superhero comic book adaptation this year then make it Watchmen."
"happyanus91","10","0","4","8 July 2009"," A great film that is highly misunderstood
","Going into this film, I had already read the graphic novel twice. I love the novel and think it may be one of the most brilliantly crafted pieces of literature ever written. When watching any adaptation, you should never sit there and try and pick apart the alterations made to the original story. My reasoning behind this is that by doing this you will never be able to just enjoy the film. Throughout the history of cinema, films have greatly differed from the material they were based off of, and yet they were loved and considered classics for what they were. The best example I can think of right off the top of my head is probably ""The Wizard of Oz"" for how I am sure it strays away the source material and yet it is one of the most beloved movies of all time because how well the changes work for the medium. The same applies to Watchmen. There has been much outcry against the altered ending, and some of the little details that have been left out. I feel that the original squid ending would never work in the film, no matter how perfect it was in the novel. A giant squid alien attack worked within the context of the comic because of how it related classic comic book lore, but on screen it would just seem random. The new ending that uses Dr. Manhattan as the final solution works in the context of the film and actually gives Dr. Manhattan more of an emotional reason to leave Earth. Now that I have gotten my rant on the film's changes out of the way I can finally analyze the film itself. I gotta say, for the most part, the casting is dead on. Rorschach is this film's Heath Ledger, in the aspect that every scene he is in, you cannot take your eyes off of him. Dr. Manhattan, the Comedian and Nite Owl II were also handled very well. The only two that were a little off were Ozymandias and Silk Spectre II. Okay, Ozzy wasn't too bad, just a little wimpier than I would have liked, but Malin Akerman's performance as Laurie/Silk Spectre II was just mediocre. She ruined almost every one of her lines with her lifeless line delivery. The example that sums up my feelings on her can be found towards the end of the film. The scene where she holds up a gun and tries to shoot Adrian was an emotional moment in the comic for Laurie as she cries and says, ""you're such an asshole"". In the film she says this, only it sounded like she was trying to give an action hero like one liner. My fanboy gripes aside, this is a movie that needs to be seen. It is possibly the most risk taking Hollywood blockbuster to come out in a long time. It is uncompromising, unforgettable and thought provoking, just like the tone of the novel. Anyone coming in expecting just a hardcore R rated version of X-Men or Spiderman will be disappointed. The films does not have that many action sequences, but it is not a story about action, it is about the characters and how society has been affected by their existence. Zack Snyder may not be very original (in the aspect that he has only directed adaptations of other artist's work so far) but he fights for his vision of how the story should be interpreted. Not many other directors would dare to do with their big Hollywood films that he has done in this one. It is almost Stanley Kubrick-esquire. I am saying this in the aspect that it is very noncommercial and tries to do things no one else is doing. I feel that Watchmen will one day get the recognition it deserves like many of Kubrick's films that were not accepted at release. It is a brilliant film that should be enjoyed as a separate work from the novel, and it will only improve with time. To sum thing's up, Watchmen follows one of Rorschach's more memorable lines: ""Never compromise, not even in the face of Armageddon."""

Most movies have no real story, and is just built to be an endless drool of nonsensical action. ""Watchmen"", like a complicated well written book, is filled with allusions and direct references to historical events.<br/><br/>The movie touches on all the real aspects of human nature, human fear, and human beliefs of morality and sacrifice.<br/><br/>For me personally, I had to watch the movie, and read historical references in Wikipedia, as well as research original imagery documented in history (such as the flower girl with the flower in the barrel of rifles scene).<br/><br/>The movie would be boring to anyone without any prior knowledge or poor knowledge and education towards the detail of topics touched in the movie. I personally wasn't that educated, but like a book I read, I look up references and allusions to further understand the underlaying elements in this movie.

It also touches topics such as the conflict for Afghanistan between the Soviets and America (in case people don't know, this conflict for Afghanistan is the prelude to the present terrorists of today).<br/><br/>The movie involves such historical figures such as Richard Nixon (37th President of the United States), Henry Kissinger (Senator of State, Nobel Peace Prize), and how the advent of a super-being would have had an affect on society.<br/><br/>In the movie, it also depicts a world where, because of Dr. Manhattan, they did not lose the Vietnam War (in reality, the U.S. withdrew), and quote-on-quote from The Comedian/Blake, ""If we lost here in 'nam, I think it might've driven us crazy.""<br/><br/>I personally found the ending filled with irony, how it depicts that the world was saved by being tricked into thinking they were attacked as a whole, when it was made to look like Dr. Manhattan destroyed the major cities. In reality, without such an event, the Soviet Union and United States ended the war without ever firing a single missile, thus the coined term, ""Cold War"". Had Adrian's plan failed, ultimately, there might still never have been a nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>""You are the smartest man on the planet.""

","""The Watchmen"" is a movie adaptation of what many consider to be the best graphic novel of all time. The differences in mediums immediately makes this process extremely difficult, but also makes the comparisons become somewhat less important. A movie must not be compared with a book even if they share so much in common and as such it must be said that ""The Watchmen"", while a failed adaptation, is an above average movie that presents the story in a comprehensible and maybe even in an enjoyable way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this reviewer has read the novel. This reviewer also noticed from the very beginning that the director wanted to be faithful to the book. Scene after scene we are shown animated copies of the book, dialog included. Impressive from a technical point of view that they are able to reproduce all that wonderful and rich imagery. The problems however became apparent soon after. Even if most of the scenes follow the book, that becomes irrelevant since so much of what adds the book its value is missing from the movie. Furthermore, the movie's visuals, even if impressive, didn't require any creative input from the crew since they are copies. All the creativity of value is mostly technical. Worse, the few creative changes that are seen in the movie are all in the purpose of showing more violence or sex or whatever commonplace sentimentality feelings they want the characters to express.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Watchmen"" is a good movie, but mostly because it doesn't stray from the novel much and has some of it's value. If you want the full vision and experience, then you're going to have to read the novel.<br/><br/>Snyder may have pulled ""300"" off, but ""The Watchmen"" required a more thoughtful approach on adaptation; decisions and choices would have to be made so that, instead of keeping the visuals, the movie could have kept the ideas and feelings of the novel.<br/><br/>7/10.

Made by the so-called visionary director of recent cinematic borefest 300, this movie was obviously a big target on everybody's radar, and I wasn't sure what to think of it - how could anyone, let alone Zack Snyder, make a film adaption of a book as layered, complex and involving as Watchmen? The answer to that question is, they took the easiest way out and just made the movie scene-for-scene with the book. Not a bad idea in the end, although there were a few minor changes. I'm quite frankly surprised how much fun this was to watch.<br/><br/>I think the main draw here for the comic-book fans is the number of not-so-subtle nods to them in the way that the movie really did pull most of the scenes here right out of the book, dialogue and all. I mean, word for word, seriously. The most shocking part of this to me, aside from the abysmal opening sequence and the stupidly gory fight scene in the allyway, was the Dr. Manhattan soliloquy on the moon, which was actually pretty much carried out in full, flashbacks and all. Rorschach's journal is vocalized a lot of the time, too, and I kind of expected that. The flashbacks are all done with high regard to the novel, and a lot of the time I was just sort of nodding my head along with it, as the book was still fresh in my memory and none of it really surprised me.<br/><br/>The violence was heavy, bloody and dark as Hell, and I was much more entertained here than I was watching big, beefy men with no shirts on sloooooowly stab each other to death in...you know, that other movie. Like I said, the beginning is silly, with the violence being kind of pointless and very poorly constructed, but after that it gets better. The scenery is awe-inspiring, with huge, bright, vivid landscapes filled with shadows and intricate details and everything else that's just icing on the cake. Just look at the city streets; V for Vendetta wishes it looked that good. And the scenes on Mars...holy hell! The costume designs, too, are all amazing, and it's a slap in the face to other comic book films that they made everyone look so much like they did in the original book. I mean...aside from Ozymandias, they look like they jumped right out of Alan Moore's graphic novel.<br/><br/>Okay, so enough book comparisons, how was the movie as a movie? Well, this was very long, very detailed, and very over the top in every aspect. The explosions are loud, and they're bright, too; I had to cover my eyes a few times. The story is told in a very jumpy comic-book-esquire format, which is no surprise, although honestly I would have preferred a totally different adaption by a smart director like Chris Nolan instead. Everything moves fast, so fast that it gives the illusion of the movie being shorter than it is (and also being ironic in the way that 300 dragged more than a car with flat tires). The story is very stylized and charismatic, with the use of several songs during the ""bigger"" moments that I actually liked a lot; they added an extra special something to the movie that I found charming and invigorating, even. Not something I'd like to see in every movie, but it works surprisingly excellently in this one. And yes, Dr. Manhattan's speech does get a bit tedious - working only in the book format, apparently; a direct copy-paste of the novel dialogue to a cinematic form is not a good idea - but for newcomers, I imagine it will at least be interesting to listen to, if not too long. And the great special effects will even keep the comic fans watching.<br/><br/>The ending is quite a spectacle, with a new bit added in that I found quite cool; won't spoil it, though. It is a lot darker in some ways, a lot lighter in others, and more Hollywood-ized, and I found that it worked. Watchmen is about as good of a straight-ahead comic book adaption as we'll get these days, so far at least, and although it is not perfect, I found it extremely entertaining and definitely worth re-watching. It isn't particularly life-changing, lacking most of the gravity and weight of the novel, but it is a provocative, interesting look at superhero films, and those who have never experienced the novel before will be in for a real treat. Recommended."

","Let us remember the recent past in the movie theater - Watchmen (2009). <br/><br/>The film when released was the list of IMDb -250 Top rated (admittedly not very long). <br/><br/>Evaluation of the film at the moment - 8.0/10 68,629 votes. <br/><br/>A bit shocking?

The only reason for which the film has collected 106 million in America and still became a blockbuster - it is a massive advertising campaign.This is saved from the immediate failure of the ""masterpiece"".

","For those expecting the normal comic book 'super-hero vs. super-villain' heroics and stunts, this movie is going to be quite a surprise.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is very character oriented. Possibly more of the movie involves flashbacks into the characters' history than it show 'current time' action. Pretty much all of these flashbacks are tied to character exposition rather than striking events.<br/><br/>The movie is very dark, and in the end, there are only a couple of characters that you have some feel you can safely like ... maybe.<br/><br/>This is most especially NOT a movie for the kiddies to watch. Not close, no how, don't do it. It has very mature themes involving vigilantism, rape, murder, mass murder, graphic violence, nudity (male and female), strong language ... you get the drift.<br/><br/>If I'd been sold on going to see a normal super-hero film, I'd have come out of the theater very disappointed. I knew going in that this was't the normal fare of the genre though, and I enjoyed the differences in what I saw. As long as you can keep that kind of open mind, you might, and I stress 'might', enjoy this film."

","2009 flick 'Watchmen' is an average entertainer. Too long and too graphic to watch. Why adapting the entire graphic novel? Why dragging it till you get exhausted? <br/><br/>Pluses: The film has been directed amazingly by Zack Snyder. After 300, 'Watchmen' is also a cinematic experience. Fantastic Special Effects. Malin Akerman is brilliant. Also, She looks amazing. Jeffery Dean Morgan is effective in a cameo. Carla Gugino has done well. Others are also good.<br/><br/>Minuses: The film's length is its biggest culprit. To long and an abrupt climax don't work at all.<br/><br/>'Watchmen' is an okay fare. Go for this one, but be prepared for a really long watch."
"derboiler","6","0","6","26 March 2009"," Even a disappointment to a fan of comics and 300
","First I have to say I love comic books. I read them my entire life and still do. In general I'm always interested in watching movies that are based on comic books. Since I really like the style of 300 I thought why not giving this movie a try and watch Watchmen?<br/><br/>This is what I have to say about the movie: The plot was interesting since it had a nice twist and turn of events. I didn't read the comic book from Alan Moore before because I wanted to be surprised by the plot. I was surprised but not in a good way...<br/><br/>Story: That said I criticize the way of telling the story. There are way too much diversions misleading the viewer from the main plot. After a while this turns out to be tiring and you get to feel the lengths of it. Zack Snyder seemed to feel the same way as he threw in some violence here and there. Perhaps to shake and wake you up anew. No prob with violence if it does make sense (like in the epic battle of 300 for example). But here it seemed really more to give the viewer a quick shock to stay focused.<br/><br/>Action parts: I like the quickness of the action scenes. It really remembers the camera movement from 300 and also the in-Action-Slow-Motion. So the action part looks good. I didn't enjoy the music in these scenes since the music takes a bit away the thrilling part of it. Watch the opening scene with the battle of the comedian to see what I mean.<br/><br/>Style: Hmmm here this really is a matter of taste. I didn't enjoy the costume design. Some but not all of them. It looked too much popcorn alike. I much more prefer the darker style like in Batman the dark night. <br/><br/>All in all it's not a bad movie but because of the mentioned points a was disappointed. So what is cool about it? I liked the casting. The actors fit their roles well. I also enjoyed the short action-scenes but be prepared there is not a lot of it in that movie... What else? Good camera-work and CGI as expected. My personal opinion 6/10"
"mattbrunker","6","0","5","25 March 2009"," Started out so promising
","Well I hadn't read the graphic novel before hand and I am sure I'll be judged for that so I'll just take a stance of 'Watchmen' as a film.<br/><br/>It seemed to be something different from all the super hero movies out there that have been duplicated and duplicated in the name of franchises. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 or so hours of this film. In the last hour or so it felt like Zack Snyder took a break from directing and Michael Bay came in to finish it... This is just an opinion but by the end of Watchmen it felt like it hard turned into just another superhero movie. Which is such a shame because for the majority of the film it was something special.<br/><br/>DO NOT READ BELOW IF YOU ARE SOME KIND OF FAT WATCHMEN GRAPHIC NOVEL NERD OR IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO CRITICIZE ME FOR THINKING THE FILM SHOULD DIFFER FROM THE NOVEL.<br/><br/>There is one scene where it pans out while John and Laurie were on Mars and there is a marking on mars that is the same as the comedians smiley face. I think that would have been a great ending and left things unfinished and not wrapped up in a nice little bow as Hollywood seems to inevitably do to 99% of its creations. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I will buy this DVD."
"Workin_Man","8","0","2","23 March 2009"," A superb action epic, but a tad too long for my liking...
","Don't get me wrong, I loved watching 'Watchmen.' In my opinion, it was a superior superhero flick. Over the top action, great dialogue, great effects, an interesting story, it had all the right elements for the making of a great movie. However, 'Watchmen' ran a lengthy 2 hours & 42 minutes. Unfortunately, many people cannot sit through a movie this long, and I believe the length hurts the greatness of this movie.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the movie was spectacular. Every single actor gave a worthy performance. An honorable mention to Billy Crudup who gave a truly memorable performance as Dr. Manhattan. You don't see this guy around a whole lot in the movie business, but when he does appear, he is always spectacular, and no exceptions here.<br/><br/>I also need to mention how the film was shot. Zack Snyder is a true visionary. He has a way of making films unnaturally dark and he took the movie, in comic book form, and turned it into a truly sinister movie. I truly respect Zack Snyder in this regard, and have always liked his style of filming, and this movie just makes my respect even stronger.<br/><br/>To end off, I would recommend this movie to all the superhero movie buffs out there. You're in for a real treat for the eyes. However, as mentioned before, the movie is lengthy (2 hours & 42 minutes) so just be aware of that when you go see it."
"Jonny_Numb","8","0","4","22 March 2009"," Heroes in Retrograde
","Only in the heavily-hyped buildup to the theatrical release of ""Watchmen"" did I sit down to read the graphic novel on which it's based. As ashamed as I am to admit it, Warner Brothers' persistent ad campaign (making sure to overstate its status as ""most celebrated of all time""!) was the only reason I bothered. The teaser trailer premiered way back in July of 2008 (bundled with ""The Dark Knight""), and my own reaction was a mix of bad laughter and undeniable curiosity. I had heard of ""Watchmen,"" of course, but my own disinterest toward hero-based comics kept me at a distance.<br/><br/>Upon reading (and, at times, struggling) through it, I came to the conclusion that ""Watchmen"" must be much more gratifying to those already predisposed toward the Supermans and Spider-Mans of the comic-book underworld. To someone more inclined toward the personal, more subjective works of Crumb and Clowes, the end result came off as distancing and condescending (especially in the ""Black Freighter"" subplot, which is thankfully absent here); the interesting, complex characters, contemporary political allusions (Richard Nixon in his third presidential term; the onset of nuclear war at the hands of the Russians), and science-fiction tropes (the space-time distortions of Dr. Manhattan), while hinting at something greater, all stood in the shadow of writer Alan Moore's pretentious structure and dialog. Too often the narrative went off on tangents that failed to synthesize with the ongoing plot into a well-rounded whole. Illustrator Dave Gibbons did his best to elevate the material through sheer imagery, but his drawings were marked by a stiffness crossed with nostalgia for the old-school DC comics. In all, ""Watchmen"" came off as a dated piece of nostalgia for a paranoid era instead of a timeless classic of the medium.<br/><br/>With this laundry list of qualms, I approached the film adaptation with no small amount of skepticism, to the point where I questioned why I even wanted to see it. Yet, sitting in the theater as the opening credits rolled, my expectations brightened to the point where I was completely wrapped up and enthralled by ""Watchmen."" While film is notorious for compromising and, at worst, denigrating beloved works of literature, it has proved a fertile medium for enhancing the graphic arts: a few years back, Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" was turned into one of the most dazzling comic adaptations of all time. And this is why ""Watchmen,"" as a film, succeeds where the novel did not: the flatness of the page has been given three-dimensional life by committed performances and a stunning visual imagination.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder is no stranger to this territory, as his Green-Screen adaptation of Miller's ""300"" proved. While I would be otherwise reluctant to call the guy a ""visionary,"" ""Watchmen"" certainly advances his mainstream credibility several notches. Showing a keen attention for period detail (the film is set in 1985), carefully utilized slow motion, and a grainy, earthy color palate that appropriately mixes the unease of a world on the brink of annihilation with a Film-Noir mood, Snyder removes the barrier of Moore's pretentious pose and puts us on a field level with the characters, whose all-too-human problems (bad childhoods, impotence, apathy, age-driven obsolescence) are surprisingly relatable. As a result, it's hard not to feel implicated in and concerned toward the outcome of the proceedings. Screenwriters David Haytner and Alex Tse, who condensed the book into a tighter narrative that sacrifices little in the way of character detail, also deserve much credit for this successful translation.<br/><br/>The plot regards the titular characters, a group of masked crimefighters operating in the latter part of the 20th century, following in the tradition of an earlier group (the Minutemen). In a volatile sociopolitical climate, however, sitting President Nixon implements a ban on masked vigilantes, thus forcing our characters into exile as common citizens. There's Edward Blake, alias ""The Comedian"" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), whose brutal murder sets the Watchmen back into action; Walter Kovacs, alias ""Rorschach"" (Jackie Earle Haley), is a street-smart psychotic who is nonetheless committed to his own brand of justice; Dan Dreiberg, alias ""Nite Owl"" (Patrick Wilson), an engineer who longs to re-connect with Laurie Jupiter, alias ""Silk Spectre"" (Malin Akerman); rounding out the group is Adrian Veidt, alias ""Ozymandias"" (Matthew Goode ), a suave corporate exec with influence in science, medicine, and merchandising; and Jon Osterman, alias ""Dr. Manhattan"" (Billy Crudup), a powder-blue, nigh-indestructible specter who can alter time and space at will. While some personalities are overshadowed by others (with Haley's Rorschach being a key scene-stealer), all are given a chance to shine, and are left to bode with questions that verge on the morally catastrophic (paralleling the looming threat of nuclear war).<br/><br/>Last year, ""The Dark Knight"" set a precedent for all comic-book adaptations to follow: it pitted a well-trod character against a villain who knew no boundaries (and, as a result, had nothing to lose), while grappling with his own inner demons; in the end, the victor of the battle seemed less important than whether or not our hero could rise above the damage that had inspired such a climate of fear. In very similar ways, ""Watchmen"" approaches the same issues, and winds up a compelling, intimate, and visually stunning tale of loyalty, tragedy, and the uncertainty of mankind's own desire to want to be saved from itself."

"m_tothe_o","7","0","4","19 March 2009"," Good try, but it could have been so much more...
","First things first, the movie is not on par with the original novel.<br/><br/>The majority of elements that stand out in the movie, such as the order that events are presented, come straight from the novel. Thats not to say Snyder hasn't added anything to this movie at all. His casting choices (Dr Manhattan and Rorschach particularly) and directing style are two redeeming qualities to mention a few. The films problem is this. The original novel was so dense and each character story so detailed that Snyder spent the majority of the movie establishing their back stories. Because of this, the first portion of the film was excellent, intriguing and well developed. However, once we're allowed to digest this information, its as if Snyder suddenly realises that he has to wrap the film up. The second half feels rushed and passionless. Apart from Rorschach (whose acting was excellent throughout), the rest of the watchmen seem almost dull and wooden as the film reaches its 'climax'. The second problem with the movie is actually Snyders fault. Although he claims to have stuck rigidly to the original material, (apart from the ending which he can be forgiven for) Snyder seems to have misunderstood Alan Moore's vision. The novel did present the Watchmen as anything more than vigilantes. Apart from Dr Manhattan, non of them actually had superpowers, unlike in the movie were the Watchmen are seen to punch through walls, fall from great heights etc.<br/><br/>In the end, its hats off to Snyder for filming the unfilmable...but... i can't help thinking it could have been something astonishing.."
"ousim-1","8","0","7","19 March 2009"," Faithful to the Novel, but not as poignant
","This movie, The Watchmen, has been a long awaited entry in theaters and for a good reason. It adapts the greatest (if not, the most ambitious) graphic novel about superheroes to be released.<br/><br/>I was very thrilled, but also suspicious upon viewing this movie. Will they do it properly or would it be another grand entertainment failure? In fact, proper would be the term for The Watchmen, as Zack Snyder and his team played safely in adapting the novel. The film was shot using the book as a storyboard. Not a bad idea, and every scenes are highly recognizable.<br/><br/>But, they didn't manage to recreate the ambiance, the tension and the poignant feeling the novel did bring to the readers. And it is certainly the major flaw of this movie, because it is overall a great work. The fact that the movie ""only"" lasts for about 3 hours plays a major part in this matter. The ending suffers greatly from being cut and we miss all of the feeling and importance it had, even though the crucial moments are still there.<br/><br/>Visually, The Watchmen depicts correctly what has been done previously. But, too much scenes still have that cold color correction that ruins all the attachment to the image a viewer can and wish it would have had. The novel color treatment is mostly in the warm tones and that plays a major role in that feeling of absorption in its universe.<br/><br/>The casting is probably the greatest success of the film. Every actor manages to get the right tone for its character. The most notable performances are Jackey Earle Haley as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg. A very good note is given to Billy Crudup for his Dr. Manhattan, a very though role due to the characters constant objectivity.<br/><br/>Finally, The Watchmen manages to bring a faithful portrait of the novel which he's based on. Faithful, but too cold to recreate the multiple emotion that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons put in place 20 years ago. Maybe it is because of that feeling of Cold War urgency we do not have anymore, but more probably because the film does not have a personality of its own.<br/><br/>A final advice for the musical score (and not only for this film): Learn to shut that music off sometimes! It kills the moment."
"Chiron1987","7","0","1","18 March 2009"," Well, it was ""Watchmen,"" but...
","I liked ""Watchmen."" It was a very authentic adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' seminal 1985 twelve-issue D.C. Comics maxi-series (not a graphic novel!), painstakingly put together by auteur Zack Snyder, but in the end, I feel like it was just a movie that didn't really need to be made.<br/><br/>Warner Bros. spent in excess of $120 million to make ""Watchmen."" This could've been better spent on a sequel to Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns,"" or any of Warner's long-gestating D.C. Comics-based films like ""Wonder Woman"" or next year's ""Green Lantern."" Warner Bros. will take a financial beating on ""Watchmen"" when they could've made a ""real"" superhero movie and captured a windfall like they did with last year's ""The Dark Knight."" But, enough financializing. ""Watchmen"" features nice performances, particularly Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, most people's favorite character from the original comic's, and perhaps, the most psychologically damaged. Haley deserves at least an Oscar nod for this role, but won't get one. Patrick Wilson is also very good as Dan Dreiberg, the second Night Owl, as is the lovely Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter, the second Silk Spectre. However, Laurie's dramatic arc from the comic feels forced and put upon here in the film. But, that's really what happens when you compress a twelve-issue series down into a two-and-a-half movie.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Dean Morgan is never quite believable as Edward Blake, the Comedian. He has the chops, but just really doesn't pull off being the real scumbag the Blake is. Matthew Goode is fairly forgettable as Ozymandias. He brings little to this, perhaps, the most pivotal role in the story. And the ending is a total cop-out, once again feeling forced and rushed. I like Carla Gugino as Sally Jupiter, the original Silk Spectre, but I like seeing her in just about anything. She isn't given much to do here, and her old-age make-up is pretty atrocious.<br/><br/>Billy Crudup makes a fine Doctor Manhattan, but his origin story depicted in the film slows the whole thing down considerably, as does Crudup's dead-pan, monotonic delivery of Osterman/Manhattan's lines. The SFX used to bring he blue, nude living atomic reactor to life is adequate, but not sufficient enough. The CGI Doctor's lips often do not match his lines, which is a bit off-putting.<br/><br/>The SFX for the film as a whole was well-done, and the set direction was spot-on to Mister Gibbons' original artwork. Much has been said about the fast-moving, incredibly choreographed fight scenes. What can I say? I liked them. It shows that these people are well trained and thoroughly experienced enough to be costumed crime fighters. What more do you want? All in all, ""Watchmen"" is a good movie, but ultimately forgettable. I still think this was money best spent elsewhere on true superheroes like the Man or Steel, the Amazing Amazon, or the Emerald Gladiator.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"chumpsteak","9","0","2","18 March 2009"," Intelligent & captivating.
","All the people who gave Watchmen a 1 or 2 star rating appear to have expected the film to be like X Men or Fantastic 4. Its a totally different sort of film, so don't expect a lightweight superhero romp from Watchmen. If you like to switch off your brain when watching a film then you probably will find it boring.<br/><br/>It's just excellent & I don't think a better film adaptation could have been made. I was a little sad to see that they cut the Black Freighter sub story but there is an animated film being released on DVD / Bluray very soon. Fans of the Graphic Novel will notice the changes made but I think the changes were essential to keep the movie under 3 hours (although I'd have happily sat there for another hour). The finale is altered but its actually more logical than the original ending & does not wimp out on the basic premise. Other little changes are made to avoid having to add lengthy scenes that would slow things down. The look and most of the atmosphere is faithfully reproduced. Sometimes the Movie gets a little glossy but that's virtually unavoidable during the big FX set pieces. In general the seedy, grimy locations (such as Moloch's apartment & the streets of New York) are very well executed. The prison scenes look amazing too.<br/><br/>The casting is spot on & I can't imagine any actors doing a better job than Wilson as Niteowl, Haley as Rorschach & Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian. In fact the portrayal of Dan Dreiberg / Niteowl was exactly as I imagined him. Even minor characters like Moloch the Mystic & the Minutemen are well thought out. The relationship between Niteowl, Silk Spectre & Manhattan is well portrayed & I always felt that I was watching real people on screen rather than cardboard cut out super-heroes.<br/><br/>The use of violence & gore is very graphic. Snyder unflinchingly shows us bone & viscera in detail. A little too much for some people but I like a bit of splatter in movies & some films avoid it just to secure a 15 rating. Many modern films try to do too much with special effects & just baffle the viewer with too much on screen (Transformers for example). Watchmen is a little more restrained & balanced the spectacular with more subdued effects when needed.<br/><br/>Its basically excellent & one more thing worth a mention is the use of familiar pop & rock music which grounds the movie in reality. Go & see it."

","I'll try to be brief: <br/><br/>1. Monstrous violence - formulaic part of the modern media. <br/><br/>2. Explicit sex - again, formulaic part of the modern media. <br/><br/>3. Duplicity of 'heroes', their less-than-heroic personal lives. Eg, the Comedian (a hero to the public) is like the Joker working in a sanctioned, law-&-order, pro-USA career.<br/><br/>4. All these people have become heroes primarily because they possess incredible talents for kicking ass; the other reasons are secondary - compulsions, abilities that can only be realized outside of society, or even to satisfy real or virtual parental expectations.<br/><br/>5. The film treats of a question: What is right? What is the right thing to do in a violent world? (In this, it parallels 'The Dark Knight' somewhat.) Dr. Manhattan, a kind of Silver Surfer without the empathy or pathos, sees things thru cosmic, material, quantum-mechanical lenses; Rorschak sees things thru an angry, angry, ANGRY code of honor comprised of the commandment, 'Never compromise'; Ozymandias, thru a web of cunning, manipulation and control of lesser beings; and so on.<br/><br/>6. Worth the watch: you feel for the 'heroes', you feel against the 'heroes', but the story's resolution is - like life, like our lives - not a 'proper' resolution at all.<br/><br/>7. Please read a good comment by 'arichmondfwc', for a different reaction.<br/><br/>8. This story, done in cinema, succeeds, whereas the actual graphic novel bored me every time I tried to read it. Somehow, the movie is less disjunctive - and as illusion, much more convincing and affecting.<br/><br/>9. One of my top five films, period."
"SLASHerMan","7","0","1","16 March 2009"," A little tiresome but well adapted
","This is certainly a worthy adaptation to the big screen. I don't know the novel religiously, but I know it somewhat well, and it seems sure enough that this film carries through the themes, events and at times even words.<br/><br/>What must be applauded is that it dares take itself seriously - it's violent, dramatic, even a bit disconcerting. Not all heroes save the day, that's really the point of the entire novel and film. You can only harp on the heart-strings so many times (even Spider-Man is getting a bit tiresome), but when a movie punches you in the face, you have a reason to be dizzy.<br/><br/>There are weak points to it though. I think the theatrical cut could've possibly been even shorter (~2h15m? come on, think about it), with some sort of absurdly extensive ultimate end-to-end-all 5-disc DVD/Blu-Ray edition further down the line.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Hayley gives a spectacular Rorschach, even his ""gravelly"" voice (really described as being more monotone) and unrelenting quest for punishing criminality. It was too bad that the psychologist scenes were a little different (maybe we'll at least get the entire closing ""monologue"" somewhere down the line, but I guess you can't have it all).<br/><br/>Some say there's ""no trick"" to Billy Crudup, but that's the trick in and of itself - to make a character seemingly indifferent feel human, earnest and interesting. He doesn't simply drone on, he's actually acting with every line and twitch.<br/><br/>The adaptation works to the point where it's like reading - it couldn't hold my interest burning passionately the entire way through, but where it does work, it really works (the opening credits and Dr. Manhattan's origin comes to mind). The fact that it does work the entire way through is a testament to the original book, that there are themes resonating beyond just the characters themselves.<br/><br/>At this point I have no rush to see Watchmen again. Whenever there's word of some sort of ultimate package, maybe I'll check it out, but there's a lot to take in, and it's mostly through the dialoge and characters. Hardly your typical action or thriller flick, but one to be savored on occasion, like (pardon the metaphor) a fine wine with enough years to it."

","Stepping away from my first viewing of Watchmen, the impression I have is of many, many memorable moments with high emotional impact, of an intricate, dark and challenging story dense with sub-plots, and of a grim picture of the emotional alienation implicit in being a costumed superhero.<br/><br/>This film is punctuated by moments of over-the-top graphic violence and graphic sex, and breaks ground with its many minutes of full frontal male nudity. The ugly violence and sexuality of its super-hero characters (the Comedian, Rohrshach, the first Silk Spectre, etc.) is breath-taking but definitely makes this a film that is not for the kiddies.<br/><br/>But I also came away shaking my head at some of the Watchmen's flaws. First, the musical ""score"" of Watchmen is atrocious. Rather than writing some original music to highlight some of the drama, tension and action, we are subjected to a lazy selection of inelegant '60s rock songs at very high volume. A musical score can make a great film much better or it can defeat it -and I feel that this musical score deeply injures the Watchmen. Graphical novels offer no meaningful guidance on the use of music to heighten drama - the Watchmen's director and creative team was on its own in this regard and the result is El Stinko.<br/><br/>Secondly I wish the acting had been better. I honestly did not believe a single line spoken by the young Silk Spectre (Number 2) and I even found the Comedian to be unconvincing.<br/><br/>Lastly, the costuming was below my expectations. All of the costumes were unflattering and inelegant. The choice of materials and textures just seemed all wrong to me. Just my personal opinion.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of Watchmen since its original publication as a 12-issue maxi-series in 1982. I don't agree with the critics who say this is a bad movie or a bad adaptation -there is simply too much here that is stunningly good. But the lazy musical scoring, the poor costuming and some instances of bad acting prevent me from giving this movie a 10."
"kunalkhandwala","8","0","1","15 March 2009"," Of flawed superheroes and inevitable apocalypse
","Zack Snyder's passion for graphic novels was remarkably portrayed in the visually stunning '300' and now he takes upon the comic book that redefined the superhero genre. 'Watchmen' is a dark and gruesome tale of retired superheroes, masked vigilantes, a cosmic powered naked man, morals, society's hypocrisy, humanity's bane and of course, apocalypse resulting from the Cold War. In an alternate 1985 era, masked superheroes have been banished by law, President Nixon wins the Vietnam War in a week with the aid of The Comedian and Dr. Manhattan whose superpowers made him a God of War and when mankind is fearing inevitable apocalypse resulting from the nuclear armament of two most powerful nations that seek to destroy each other. Meanwhile, a mysterious avenger is trying to eliminate retired costume heroes that formed 'the Watchmen', beginning with the brutal murder of the Comedian. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), whose notebook entries form the cold narrative that also delineates the philosophy of heroism and ineptitude in the wake of more powerful forces. <br/><br/>While the film often meanders around former Silk Spectre's sub- plot and some cheesy love story between NightOwl and Laurie, it gains elevation from two strong characters that not only make this film worth watching but also re-define heroes and superheroes in the comic book genre. Dr. Manhattan, a blue CGI naked body that resulted from an atomic scientist being involved in a lab accident, gained a new cosmic powered form after the disintegration. He now has the ability to teleport himself and people around him as well as destroy and create matter as he can toy with it at the atomic level. His superpowers make the rest of the Watchmen inept and thus, it eventually leads to the disbanding of the superhero league. What is remarkable about Dr. Manhattan's character is his lack of understanding of human nature while he seeks solace in celestial forms of matter. Billy Crudup's soft voice for this larger than life character is just the opposite of what we would expect and that truly forms the beauty of the characterization. Alan Moore would be mighty proud if he would've approved of the film in the first place.<br/><br/>Rorschach refused to hang his ever-evolving mask. This cynical, absurd and violent hero whose brutal tactics made the entire prison thirst for his blood, is the ambiguously symbolic character of 'Watchmen'. True that Rorschach's diary is where the original graphic novel's deep philosophies had evolved, it plays well with Haley's gritty voice. Sharp as a detective and brutal as a psychopath, Rorschach investigates the Comedian's killing and the attack on the other 'Watchmen'. The unveiling of his mask and flashback to his past when he transformed from Walter Kovacs to Rorschach take the character to a maddening height. <br/><br/>'Watchmen' is not your typical superhero movie where costumed vigilantes save the day just as you expect them to. It doesn't shock you with heroic entries over rooftops and in incredible vehicles. In fact, Watchmen's superheroes are deeply flawed and the realization of their flaws led to their ineptitude and disbanding. It is serious, gruesome, political and philosophical in its preaching of the thin membrane that separates morality from immoral actions by the proclaimed 'heroes' which are purposeful towards a brighter end. Vanity of powers, insecurity of the future, fragility of the world and an ever-approaching doom are the mythological ideas brought to life in Alan Moore's book. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder's adaptation picks up from almost every page in the book. The flashback sequences are well scripted and flow seamlessly without causing much confusion and headache. Almost as if the writers of 'LOST' had offered some assistance on that. While Rorschach narrates from his diary, Snyder shoots many scenes in rainy nights to capture the eeriness of the events while avoiding clichÃ©s and redundancy that would cause any digression. The opening credits put pages and pages of the book into outstanding snapshots of the past events that lead to today, 1985 in the film. The graphics are spectacular and the action, simply breath-taking, even though it may be gruesome for kids and therefore the 'R' rating of the film. The background score draws inspiration from erstwhile hits and suits all moods very well. Performances by Haley as Rorschach, Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt and Jeffrey Morgan as Edward Blake-The Comedian are outstanding while the rest are just mediocre. <br/><br/>The legendary source material and its great adaptation in screenplay give 'Watchmen' its strengths of strong characterization, philosophical depth, breath taking action, shockingly gruesome sequences, outstanding narration that made the film comprehensible even without reference to the book and spectacular visual effects. Zack Snyder has not redefined comic book adaptations on screen but he sure has depicted Moore's graphic novel with almost fanatic devotion. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.222 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","this movie was a masterpiece. the plot made a lot of sense. when i saw it the audience was astonished by the action. this movie was so good it should have won 2 Oscars. i didn't know a superhero could punch like that. the ending was a fairly good ending. my favorite character through the movie was rorshack. but i thought that in the movie Jackie Earle Haley was the one who fought the most along side the comedian. i was a little mad that rorshack died but he was still the best character. the movie kept me guessing until the end. i was definitely not disappointed!!! it was the best movie i had ever seen in my 13 years of life. i would definitely recommend it if you like action films with superheroes. it is also not cheesy. you can bet i will be the first in In to buy it on 2 disc unrated DVD. watch it now!"

"jean-gove","8","0","1","15 March 2009"," Real superheroes: power and nihilism
","So, somebody did it. Whenever I used to watch powerful superheroes like Superman, I used to wonder about how better one could portray Superman acting radically different in real life - he might try to solve small problems at first, take out a few madmen and crime bosses, but eventually he will inevitably think that the ills of society can be fixed permanently by taking, or at least dabbling in, political power. He, as the Superman, would do a better job of ordering the world in a way he sees fits and fixing it that way, rather than ""fixing"" all its small leaks piecemeal.<br/><br/>Anyway, so this spectacular film portrays a group of superheroes with varying skills and abilities but in a much more realistic way, which means that this film is very dark and somewhat violent, and not for kids. The superheroes are corrupted, just like we are, by their powers, they work more intimately as state apparatus than Superman or the X-men would ever think comfortable, and you'll find little idealism here. Despite it being a superhero flick and has some action in it, it definitely does not count as an action film.<br/><br/>It's set in an alternative world where the Cold War between the Soviets and the US is coming to a collision, partly due to the presence of the American superheroes themselves. The superheroes must act or the world will tear itself apart, but they also have their own problems to solve. Most of them are retired following public sentiment against them. And now there's someone killing superheroes. (The word ""superhero"" is never used in the film I think. ""Costumed hero"" is what they use, which is not applicable for at least one of them.) One of the problems with the film is that it is very very slow-moving, which is why it is also very long (2hrs 45mins), but obviously it's condensing a whole comic series into one film, so it needs time to introduce all the characters and the issues. Another problem is that it never seems to unite itself completely by the end, and remains to an extent a collection of stories about superheroes - this is probably just my feeling however, and an effect of its length. Another thing which bugged me personally was the pop music going off at slow-motion intervals tracing several characters at once - for various reasons I thought the choice of music jarred with the feel and subject matter of the film, but that may have been the initial intention.<br/><br/>Also, the philosophy of most of the heroes is somewhat right-wing nihilist... One of the things the film ""predicts"" correctly is that superhero crime-fighters would start with a soft lefty touch on criminals, but due to their constant exposure to lowlife crime would end up with a hard righty fist."
"andymcneill75","10","0","1","15 March 2009"," What a Film!!!
","Truly a brilliant and epic movie adaption of a classic graphic novel, Watchmen is a phenomenal movie which will divide critics and fans but will be looked upon in the years to come as a bold and audacious statement on the superhero film. Zack Snyder has done a great job and everything looks as though it has jumped straight off the page. The graphic style, the colours, the artwork of this film are just great to look at and deserve huge credit. The Acting is roundly superb by all concerned especially Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach ( who in my opinion should be a front runner for next year's best supporting actor Oscar, a nomination at the very least!) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan who delivers a career-making role though which is limited in screen time is utterly believable as the sadistic and brutal Comedian. Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson were great as well and although Malin Akerman has been getting pelters she's fine as is Carla Gugino and Mathew Goode adds a sinister shadyness as Veidt. Tyler Bates' score was very atmospheric and the film's use of songs in the soundtrack was brilliant. Those Opening titles are the best i have seen in a very long time. Not only is this up there with The Dark Knight as one of the greatest comic-book films it is also a huge homage to 50s sci-fi at it's best and has some nice film noir touches. I also think the ending worked perfectly well and i felt a touch sad but in the end it made perfect sense. Great film and the haters will change their opinions over the years and if it doesn't come to be truly appreciated it will most definitely become a huge cult classic. Alan Moore should be proud. Brilliant, bold, dark, exhilarating comic-book classic!! Overall an 'A'"
"gcronau","6","0","1","15 March 2009"," Like a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing.
","I think Zack Synder's legacy from this film will be to show, once and for all, why you *can't* make a movie exactly like the book.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I think this was a very valiant effort. I would say that at least 80% of the scenes were an exact match to scenes from the graphic novel, and at least that much of the dialog was word for word lifted from the novel.<br/><br/>The problem was, there wasn't enough of them. Scenes or words.<br/><br/>As someone who read the graphic novel many years ago, and re-read it again recently, I knew what was happening in each scene, but I had to keep putting myself in the position of someone who *hadn't* read the novel. The question I kept asking myself was ""Would someone who hadn't read the novel understand this scene, or understand it's significance?"" and the answering I kept getting was ""no"".<br/><br/>It really did feel like I was looking at an extremely well made and detailed jigsaw puzzle, of which half the pieces had been stolen. The general picture was more or less visible, but too many of the details were missing.<br/><br/>One can only hope the DVD version is much longer."
"kevin_crighton","8","0","1","15 March 2009"," A flawed but impressive attempt at the so-called 'unfilmable' book
","After the murder of a costumed hero called 'The Comedian,' another hero called Rorschach begins an investigation, which reveals a bigger and more terrifying plot...<br/><br/>Alan Moore, the writer of the original graphic novel wants nothing to do with Watchmen the movie. He calls the book unfilmable. Terry Gilliam said it could be only done in a mini-series. Both Paul Greengrass and Darren Aronofsky tried to make it, but plans fell through. In the end it was Zack Snyder, director of 300 who finally got the job done. And despite some flaws, he's done a very good job of it.<br/><br/>Anyone going into see Watchmen, expecting another Ironman, or Dark Knight, are in for a shock. The Watchmen story is far more complex than that. While there is action sequences in the movie, the story isn't about that. This is a movie about costumed superheroes, that plays much more like a drama than action film. I know that some of the audience at the screening I was at were surprised by what they were seeing. You don't go into a movie about superheroes expecting long flashbacks, brutal violence (including the attempted rape of a hero), a strong sex scene, and heroes actually killing the bad guys, and sometimes the innocent too. It fully justifies it's 18 certificate in the UK.<br/><br/>Let's be clear. There is no way you could film Watchmen and keep everything in. Gilliam was right about that. So there has been parts of the story cut out. The ending of the book has been changed too. But writers David Hayter and Alex Tse have done an impressive job trimming the story down. Fans of the graphic novel will probably not like the changes but overall I think they work well.<br/><br/>Snyder deserves credit for some of his choices for the movie. As I said, then ending has been altered, but still works as well as the book does. And by changing the ending, he's allowed himself to cut out a sub-plot to help the running time (though part of this, Tales From The Black Freighter has been turned into an animated movie and is available on DVD I believe). But he doesn't cut back on the violence or the blood when it's needed. It's clear he is a fan of the material, but that does bring up some of the flaws the movie has.<br/><br/>Snyder is probably too faithful to the material a times. And yet he does remove or change little scenes that should be there (I'm thinking of an exchange between 2 characters towards the end). Perhaps if he could have stepped back from the material, this would have helped. Also, his use of slow-motion during some fight and action scenes is a little jarring. I think he should have just let the scenes flow. They would have worked fine without it.<br/><br/>The soundtrack too has a problem. While the songs themselves are good ( Hendrix's All Along The Watchtower for example), where he puts them into the movie at times just feel odd. And then over the end credits, after using mostly music from the past, they include a cover version of Desolation Row by My Chemical Romance! The songs don't quite gel with the movie.<br/><br/>Hayter and Tse's script does lift a lot of lines from the novel and is a good adaptation. And by casting lesser known actors instead of big name stars, Snyder gets performances that are all first rate,with special mention going to Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl. Billy Crudup playing Doctor Manhattan does a good job, and the use of CGI in his on screen appearance is impressive.<br/><br/>In fact, the whole production is impressive. The CGI, both for Manhattan, the scenes on Mars, and at the end are all stunning. Having the original books co-creator and illustrator Dave Gibbons on board certainly would have helped with this. It is true that some of the make-up doesn't work quite as well, but this is only a minor flaw.<br/><br/>Overall though you get the impression the makers wanted to do the best version of the book they possibly could. And while there are flaws with what they have done, I think they've come up with a movie that while not up there with the The Dark Knight (still the best comic book movie ever made), is still a very impressive movie.<br/><br/>One of the lines for this movie, is 'Who watches the Watchmen?' After seeing this, I hope a lot of people do. It may be a long movie, but it is worth it."
"wwwsystems","8","0","1","15 March 2009"," Liked It
","I had not read the comic but still enjoyed the movie. A bit of research on the net got me up to speed on the overall plot but I had to see it twice to really start to take everything in.<br/><br/>I thought the characters and actors were adequate for their parts, with The Comedian and Rorschach being outstanding. Ozymandias was the only portrayal that seemed a bit off center.<br/><br/>I related to Dr. M much more strongly than any of the other characters. I have read many who could not get into his head at all. Guess it just depends on the person.<br/><br/>The violence was just way out of bounds in a couple of scenes - I simply closed my eyes for those parts as there are some things I do not want my brain to contain. Sad the filmmaker felt the need to ""spice things up"" by taking it over the top.<br/><br/>The ""huge"" glowing blue penis - huh? It was not THAT big considering his size and frankly, if I had to reconstruct myself from subatomic particles anyway, I'd make me well hung too. Human males have penises and you can see them when they are naked - it is amazing to me that this is noteworthy - but it shows up in every piece I read about this movie....<br/><br/>I liked this much more than I expected to, even though I do not agree with all the messages the movie contains. If you care about film and/or the genre, I think it is definitely worth checking out."
"Moonsanchez","9","0","1","14 March 2009"," not everyone should watch the Watchmen
","actually, everyone SHOULD watch this movie because it is awesome and i want it to do well (although the marketing has been really swell, so no worries there). unfortunately everyone i know that has not read the novel, thought this movie sucked. because they were ignorant of the material and expected another X-Men type film. one guy i know actually wrote a log complaining about how they didn't have super-powers. on the one hand, i want to tell people to read the novel before they watch the movie; on the other hand, the movie is pretty much just the novel fleshed out(except for one major plot change that really plays off as a minor change), the way No Counrty For Old Men was almost exactly a verbatim adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, so in reality, you don't HAVE to read the original (for either of those movies because i know people that thought No Country sucked too), just as long as you keep an open mind for what is in store. in movies in general, you don't have to know anything about the original source material other than the fact that it exists because the Hollywood machine doesn't want to alienate audiences by making movies they can't see because they're not in on it. Watchmen does not do that, and that's part of what makes this movie work for me. i think Alan Moore would actually be okay with this adaptation of his work. i know Dave Gibbons liked it.<br/><br/>the staple of any good mystery is that you should be able to watch or read it several times and still be enthralled despite knowing the outcome. so the first time i saw Watchmen i was a little bothered by how the film didn't really seem to keep Adrian Veidt's secret role as the mastermind. but i can see why they made that decision: really with as little time Adrian/Ozymandias has in the story, why not play it up a bit for the really really hard-core fan-boys? so the second time i saw the movie i was a lot better with it, but maybe that's because i kind of have to be.<br/><br/>the acting was pretty solid, with each actor (for me) living up to expectations, but there is an extended kudos for Billy Crudup's in-depth interpretation of Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan. i always pictured a really detached, monotonous performance. and Crudup DOES do that, but with a great deal of emotion. it's really incredible! and the sets alone were priceless. on all levels i just found this to be a cinematic masterpiece. it was everything i hoped it would be."
"bakerd13","6","0","2","14 March 2009"," Not bad, but not great.
","I don't want to go on and on about this movie. The fact is that it began, following the book perfectly until about the one-hour point, and then it went on its own way. I have read the book, and the book is great, and the movie started to be as good as the book, but unfortunately, the movie would have had to be about five hours long to truly captivate its written counterpart. With that being said, I can only say this: if you have read the book, you will be disappointed. If you haven't, you may very likely truly enjoy the uniqueness of the movie. I really only have two complaints about the movie. One, I didn't need to see Dr. Manhattan's penis every five seconds. Two, the ending is different from the book, and with that, I was disappointed because Dr. Manhattan is made to be the villain, when in the book he is not. So, if you are expecting something truly different and unique, go see it. If you are expecting Spider Man or Superman, stay home and order pizza. And finally, if you are a parent with young children, and you take them to see this movie, you should be ashamed of yourself and your kids should be taken from you. Take responsibility for your kids, please!"

","I have read the comic book when at school and in an enthusiastic manner shared it with a friend- which did not share my enthusiasm finding the characters and especially the Jupiter mother miserable. Reading a comic book of this character is a private and intense experience therefore I admit that when I saw the movie and realized how much it has been reviewed and analyzed, I was disappointed feeling that I had lost the pleasure of an arcane and introspective experience.<br/><br/>Cleverly the director has an extensive introductory sequence which explains a lot of the environment and personal histories of the characters and thus partially solves the problem of presenting the information that in the comic book is offered in the form of text, such as newspaper articles or diary entries. Otherwise as far as I remember, except some cuts the graphic novel is followed closely in plot and dialogue. Some of the violent scenes have aesthetic elements closely reminding Sin City.<br/><br/>I have to note that I found the dialogue between Mr. Manhattan and Silver Spectre 2 on Mars rather embarrassing, since I thought that those were far two weighty and perhaps pretentious stuff to share with a movie audience.<br/><br/>Rorsarch was a character played well since he is a plausible yet twisted human being with religious yearnings- not so accurately portrayed in the movie as in the graphic novel- and a troubled childhood. He is also very strong physically but still within human conception, unlike the Olympian Ozymandias or the impossible Dr. Manhattan.<br/><br/>This movie has brought forward early memories in me and I am trying to remember out of memory the parts of the graphic novel left out from he filmic production.<br/><br/>Still I believe that the most impressive sequence is the introductory one which is I think mainly the creation of the director."

What the hell kind of superhero are you? <br/><br/>#8-Nudity, hey I love seeing boobies as much as the next guy if not more, but the sex scenes seemed to be in there to say 'Hey geeks, look you too can get laid on day.

","Firstly let me start by saying this move was brilliant. The one thing i thought that bought down this movie was Dr. Manhattan. He is an interesting character bought down in this movie by his genitals being shown all the time. In the graphic novel it was shown very rarely. This movie kept true to the graphic novel in many ways including direct speech being taken out of the graphic novel. I felt as if the movie needed some strong female presence as neither Malin Akerman or Carla Gugino seemed to interest me. The sex scene was a bit over the top and people should be warned of this.

","This decade had a bunch of movies with lots of visuals and little substance. The past year and a half( beginning holiday 07)is trying to erase that. The legend is true: DC comics has the strong stories. I'm a Marvel and Image fan, but I know good stuff when I see it and The Watchmen is good! The only gripe about the film is all the naked male ass, glowing or otherwise. Dudes where's the glowing pants, glowing clover leaf? Cover that stuff up! I'm glad I was a little buzz because the film looked like one of those flick that required you to be on a little something. I think for every side shot or any shot showing the female sacred behind and hips(the shots were done with taste), more time was giving to the male narrowness(The shot were raw, no chaser, in your face, wtf, 20 seconds seemed forever). Even in my altered state I had to cover my face. Okay, enough joking about the contradiction or double whatever, see it at IMAX at your own risk ha.<br/><br/>This movie will probably be in the Fine arts cinema in another decade like Blade Runner. Yep it's a classic. I don't see where a sequel can manifest from this one unless there's a whole new set of stories and characters. This is the first real super hero drama/soap opera in my eyes. Definitely an NC-17 film crammed into a massive R rating and that's a compliment. I thought The Dark Knight should have been an R, but that's how strong these stories appear to me. One can forget the characters are super heroes. You know they got something extra, but their situations are more than their powers. It's a goody with some strong subjects and visuals.

From the theater trailers (knowing nothing of the source material), we went to see it thinking it would be a typical comic-style super hero action movie. It was rather cold and had a convoluted message - which was ts ultimate point, I surmise. If you weren't captivated by the original story source, I think you would find the story to be not that exciting and VERY VERY long."
"jon.h.ochiai","9","0","2","12 March 2009"," Awe Inspired ""Watchmen""
","In Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" the hero is flawed, very human, not necessarily noble, and perhaps more an artifact of whose side he stands. ""Watchmen"" is mesmerizing and compelling. Snyder (""300"") emerges as one of the premiere action directors and storytellers with a distinctive visual style. When Watchmen Rorschach (powerful Jackie Earle Haley) is interviewed by the prison psychiatrist, he confesses, ""God doesn't make the world this way. We do."" ""Watchmen"" has amazing gravitas. In ""Watchmen"" evils prevails in the world, and exists within its heroes.<br/><br/>'Watchmen"" is heroic tragedy in the struggle of questionable good against evil. The screenplay by David Hayter (""X-Men"") and Alex Tse is based on the beloved graphic novel by Alan Moore that was illustrated by Dave Gibbons. ""Time Magazine"" named ""Watchmen"" as one the 100 Greatest Novels of the 20th Century. Set in an alternate 1985 where Richard Nixon has been President for 25 years, the threat of Cold War is very real with the Soviet Union. Superheroes are part of the American culture, until Nixon passes a law outlawing their masks.<br/><br/>In ""Watchmen"" most of the superheroes have no superpowers, except for Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a shredded naked blue skinned man who can control matter, space, and time. At a story arc his lover Laurie/ Silk Spectre II (stunning Malin Akerman) asks Jon (Dr. Manhattan) to save the world. Jon replies, ""Why would I save a world I no longer have a stake in?"" The god-like Dr. Manhattan has forfeited all his humanity.<br/><br/>These heroes are not necessarily good people. The Comedian/ Edward Blake (stark and amazing Jeffery Dean Morgan) is a cold blooded killer and misogynist. Rorschach (Haley) is a sociopath. Androgynous billionaire Adrian Veidt (charismatic Matthew Goode) is the ""outted"" superhero Ozymadias, who fancies himself as a modern day Alexander the Great. Dan (vulnerable Patrick Wilson) is the conflicted hero Nite Owl. Laurie Jupiter's (Malin Akerman) mother Sally (tragic Carla Gugino) is a bitter drunk hiding a dark secret. The nobility of ""Watchmen"" is that each has to act heroically in the face of their failings.<br/><br/>So ""Watchmen"" are great fighters with amazing martial arts prowess. Dannon Caro and Richard Cetrone craft visually explosive fight sequences. However, ""Watchmen"" apparently like the graphic novel is more than its action. 'Watchmen"" is really a murder mystery that leads to an insidious global conspiracy in this grand morality play.<br/><br/>The relentless hero seeking the truth is Rorschach (Haley), who wears a mask with morphing ink blot patterns, possessing unequaled force of will and fighting prowess. Deep personal suffering and genius haunt sociopath Rorschach's quest and existence. He is crazy; however, there is something so noble. Haley's portrayal is electrifying. Uncovering the truth, Rorschach says, ""Never compromise! Not even in the face of Armageddon."" The paradox: Rorschach will kill evil men without mercy, but for him the ends can never justify the means.<br/><br/>""Watchmen"" opens with the vicious murder of The Comedian (Morgan). Blake concedes, ""It's just a matter of time, I suppose."" Rorschach wonders if this is the first in the plot kill off the Watchmen, and pleads for Dan (Wilson) to help. Dan is no longer in the game. He meets with Veidt (Goode), who dismisses Rorschach as paranoid. In the meantime Rorschach reunites with Dr. Manhattan (Crudup) and Laurie (Akerman). Jon is obsessed in his work with Veidt to change the world; at the same time isolating himself from Laurie. Laurie eventually finds comfort and solace with Dan, who is a good man. For both there is a visceral sexual thrill in superhero.<br/><br/>Amidst the melodrama on earth and Mars, Rorschach follows the murder trail that reveals a heinous conspiracy. To that end Zack Snyder weaves an astonishing tale. My bud Ron is a huge ""Watchmen"" fan. He said that Snyder delivers about a 95% faithful translation. The outcome was altered from the book; however, he said that ""Watchmen"" retains its spirit and emotional resonance.<br/><br/>Snyder generates amazing performances from Haley and Morgan. All the performances are strong. Matthew Goode is a surprise as Veidt, who has the right balance of duplicity and nobility. Malin Akerman is commanding and sexy as Laurie. Patrick Wilson infuses great humanity in Dan. The compelling story, strong performances, and stunning visuals result in an awesome ""Watchmen""."
"RainDogJr","9","0","2","11 March 2009"," Dawn of the Superhero
","This is an ironic story, once a brilliant scientist had his own sort of typical superhero story, certainly unexpected, certainly his life changed completely and then it was the dawn of the superhero, ""God exist and is American"". And yes Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) was born in America and after his life changed completely he was known as Dr. Manhattan, of course his name help you to remember that he is an American. Now is 1985, a nuclear holocaust is right on the corner, really big tension between the US and the Soviet Union. At one point cities are completely destroyed, the president of the United States, Richard Nixon, will get a surprise: the attack was not caused by the Soviet Union, it was caused by Dr. Manhattan, yes the same who was the key for the US to win in Vietnam, the same who still was there working with the US Government. But after all he does saved the world from the nuclear war, now is a time of ""peace and love"", is all over, the destruction brought peace. So is sort of ironic that the ""American God"" Dr. Manhattan destroyed New York City (and other big cities of the world) and also that destruction brought the end to a conflict that was near to become a nuclear war but that Dr. Manhattan caused the destruction is only the official version, is certainly what almost all the people think is the truth, only few know that is not the truth.<br/><br/>In the first month of this year I saw another movie based on a recognized comic book, I saw Frank Miller's The Spirit in January and in my IMDb comment of it I wrote that even that even that I never read something from Will Eisner I was interested in seeing The Spirit, basically was the same thing with Zack Snyder's Watchmen certainly since I never read something from Alan Moore but still I was really interested in seeing Watchmen. Also in my IMDb comment of The Spirit I mentioned the Zack Snyder film 300 that, as you know, was based on the Fran Miller graphic novel. While Miller went to make his debut as director or better while Miller lost his mind and directed a big piece of s*** Snyder went to work on a project based on the work of an artist who, unlike Miller, will not even consider to watch the final product (Moore is not even credited as writer of the graphic novel). And unlike Miller and his The Spirit Snyder ended with a much superior work than the $uccessful 300.<br/><br/>Anyway, Watchmen begins in 1985 and, like I wrote, a nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union is very near. Superheroes are outlawed so basically when the Comedian (great performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed there's only one of his old partners that is there still with a mask, one who certainly known that the Comedian couldn't die in a simple robbery. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Hurley is also great) is our man, he still wears his ""face"" and we trust him as the vigilante that knows that there's something behind the death of the Comedian. So soon after he found that the Comedian was killed he will go with his old pals, including Daniel Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson), who was Nite Owl II, and Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman), who was Silk Spectre II. Our story in 1985 is pretty much the great Rorschach trying to find more who is behind the death of the Comedian and Daniel having the worry and fear like many other people because of the times but certainly knowing that he can act (and also having an opportunity to become a dream in real, certainly I'm talking about the opportunity he has to be more than just friends with Laurie)."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","8","0","1","11 March 2009"," A Flawed, Yet Often Sensational Film
","In my opinion, Watchmen couldn't have come out at a worst time. Pouncing upon a public which is still captivated by the genre-shattering masterpiece which is The Dark Knight, Watchmen not only has to face fans of the acclaimed graphic novel upon which it is based, but members of the public who are expecting another comic-book movie classic.<br/><br/>Whilst the film never strays far from its source material (apart from the ending) and is almost certain to please fans, it isn't the masterpiece that many were hoping for. There are many incredible moments, but Watchmen's flaws alienate it from classic status.<br/><br/>The film primarily takes place in New York, 1985. A retired superhero, formerly known as ""The Comedian"" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has been thrown to his death from his high-rise apartment. Former colleague and vigilante Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) believes that this is the beginning of a plot to hunt down and kill superheroes, or ""masks"". He therefore warns his former colleagues, who include the only genuinely super-powered hero ""Dr Manhattan"" (Billy Crudup), struggling Average-Joe Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson), conflicted Laurie (Malin Akerman) and billionaire Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode). As Rorschach digs deeper into the supposed conspiracy, he discovers a much more frightening threat <br/><br/>One of the main problems with Watchmen is that it both feels too long and too short. The 160-minute running time is so full with ideas and individual story lines that it feels like the filmmakers should have made two films in order to give their ideas more time to breathe. The fact that the filmmakers are determined to be almost immovably faithful to the novel that it is based on could be to blame for this. The filmmakers are too busy replicating moments from the novel to notice that there are times when the film either drags, or seems slightly rushed. Also, the movie is crafted in such a way that some audience members will be able to see who the ""villain"" is before their identity is revealed. However, the film overall has surprising psychological depth.<br/><br/>The performances are strong. There are three exceptional turns from Crudup, Dean Morgan and Earle Haley and, apart from Akerman, the rest are good enough to be convincing in their roles. <br/><br/>Crudup gives a powerfully subtle performance as Dr Manhattan, who's slowly drifting away from humanity due to his almost godly powers. It's not easy to portray the emotions of a character when the character is largely emotionless and created by CGI, but Crudup pulls it off. In limited screen time, Dean Morgan finds surprising amounts of humanity and sympathy in a sociopath who commits crimes such as attempted rape and shooting a pregnant woman. However, the best performance comes from Jackie Earle Haley. Although Rorschach is hidden behind a mask for the majority of the film, Earle Haley's voice overflows with such vivid power that we quickly come to both fear and respect Rorschach. Once his mask is taken off, Rorschach is like a frightened child and a deadly animal thrown together in a blender. Earle Haley brings both hard-edged determination and quivering vulnerability to the role. These three performances are compelling to watch.<br/><br/>Wilson does a good job of portraying Dan as a trapped man, who longs to escape from the shackles of normal life. Arguably the most controversial cast member in the film, Goode at first seems uncomfortable in the role of Adrian Veidt, but he soon finds the right mixture of unique heroism and cool arrogance which suits the character nicely.Also, in her few scenes, Carla Gugino is solid as Sally Jupiter, Lauries's mother. The only major weak link in the cast is Malin Akerman. Sure, she oozes sexuality, but, apart from a few good moments, she never manages to bring much emotion or humanity to the role of Laurie, coming across as disappointingly bland. <br/><br/>Directors such as Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Ultimatum) and Terry Gilliam (Brazil) have tried and failed to bring Watchmen to the screen. That Zack Snyder, director of the surprisingly good 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead and 2007's stylish-if-brainless 300, has finally succeeded the feat is a great success. What makes it greater is the fact that he allows his love and enthusiasm for the material and the characters to ooze from every frame. His direction isn't perfect (sometimes his worshipping of the text leads to unnecessary bloating, and his obvious love of slow-motion becomes tiresome in the more dramatic scenes) but Snyder has still done a very good job at getting Watchmen to the screen. There are some moments, such as the already well-known and superb opening montage set to Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", where you wonder whether the adverts calling Snyder a visionary are really over-hyping it. The writing follows the text religiously, and although the screenplay isn't flawless, it does its job nicely.<br/><br/>There may be flaws in the acting, directing and writing departments, but they don't stop Watchmen from being a visual feast. Everything, from the gritty yet stylish production design (the streets that the characters wander through have the distinct look of something out of Taxi Driver) to the visual effects (the origin story of Dr. Manhattan is chilling), grasps you around the collar and effortlessly pulls you into the story. The action sequences are brilliant. The stand-outs are a brutal opening punch-up between The Comedian and a shadowy attacker (the soundtrack choice of Nat King Cole's ""Unforgettable"" is pure genius reminiscent of the use of ""Over the Rainbow"" in Face/Off) and a prison riot. The soundtrack choices are excellent, apart from the use of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" during a sex scene which verges on soft-core porn.<br/><br/>Watchmen's the Phantom Menace of 2009. You'll either like it or you won't. In my opinion, it isn't flawless. But at its best, it's a visionary, stunning and unique movie, one which will be remembered by many people long after 2009 is over."
"PWNYCNY","6","0","3","11 March 2009"," Excellent musical soundtrack in an otherwise mediocre movie.
","For a movie to be effective as entertainment, it has to tell a coherent story. This movie does not do that. Instead the story is a convoluted series of disconnected scenes. Also, the use of an alternative future does not work. It is too contrived. The superheroes are back, but so what? The acting was good, especially that of Stephen McHattie who is the star of the movie. The actor who plays the Comedian also gives an excellent performance. But the entire production seems to be little more than an animated comic book, which is not surprising since the movie is based on comic book characters. However, this movie offers one excellent feature: the music. The musical soundtrack includes ""Sounds of Silence"" by Simon and Garfunkle. Because of the musical soundtrack the movie, if not great, is at least watchable."

","""As dark as it gets..."" Amen, brother- and thank God. This is the one I've been waiting for since I sprang into the world. As a kid, I was weaned on this stuff. I wasn't picky: I ate it all up, every title by every publisher I could get my hands on. I see in Rorschach Steve Ditko's faceless hero, THE QUESTION (a back-up feature in the resurrected and overhauled BLUE BEETLE comic from Charlton Comics) and Nite Owl is a cross between Jerry Siegel's Golden Age hero THE OWL and the Dell reprise of same. (Siegel, you'll recall, in collaboration with artist Joe Schuster, took inspiration from Phil Wylie's hero in the pulp novel THE GLADIATOR and co-created Superman, thereby giving birth to the superhero comic in America. Siegel also created another favorite of mine, THE SPECTRE.) Dr. Manhattan is a cross between CAPTAIN ATOM (another Charlton hero rendered by Ditko), Gold Key's DR. SOLAR, MAN OF THE ATOM, and Marvel's long-suffering cosmic hero, THE SILVER SURFER. The Comedian suggests THE PEACEMAKER, another Charlton Comics character (I remember art by Pat Boyette). I can't recall a female hero from the Charlton line that might've inspired The Silk Spectre, but she reminds me of a Golden Age hero called PHANTOM LADY (down to her costume). Ozymandius is, of course, the fabled Kryptonian himself (I'm guessing). The Minute Men could've stepped straight from the covers of a hundred Golden Age comics. One of the ironies of a movie like THE WATCHMEN is that it revolves around (and borrows liberally from) comic book characters that, until now, have had no screen time. Not on the big screen, nor the small. (And the handful of heroes we've seen on television over the years have, for the most part, been badly done- heroes like Prince Namor (that's ""Roman"" spelled backwards), who surfaced as THE MAN FROM ATLANTIS; BATMAN ('nuff said there); THE FLASH (saddled with a sidekick); THE SWAMP THING (who became, like THE HULK, a kind of wandering social worker); Superman in SMALLVILLE (whereupon he doesn't even wear the costume that, to my mind, makes every hero one in spirit with the likes of Muhammad Ali or The Red Baron: ""Here I am, come and get me!""- the raison d'etre of crimefighters, this willingness to stand up and say to Evil: ""You gotta get by me, first!""); WONDER WOMAN (though it's hard to fault their choice for the lead); etc. About the best that can be said of televised super-heroics is that there have been some decent animated shows done over the years- but, wth the exception of the George Reeves series, nothing of lasting value when it comes to live-action. (I'm talking about super heroes, here, and not ZORRO with Guy Williams or THE SCARECROW with the late Patrick McGoohan or THE LONE RANGER with Clayton Moore, or any other such non-super hero.) Feature films have been far better, overall, but, even there, the pickings are still pretty slim. The graphic novel series MARVELS would be a good way to introduce a number of heroes at once (the original combustible-android HUMAN TORCH, Bill Everette's SUB-MARINER, THE VISION, DR. STRANGE, et al), or KINGDOM COME (THE SPECTRE, MARTIAN MANHUNTER, THE CREEPER, DEADMAN, THE JUSTICE SOCIETY, etc.). ASTRO CITY would be a good choice, too. Or the Tower Comics (DYNAMO, NO MAN, etc., by Wally Wood) or MAGICMAN from FORBIDDN WORLDS or NEXUS- or Russ Manning's MAGNUS, ROBOT FIGHTER and Frank Thorne's MIGHTY SAMSON from Gold Key (not to mention TUROK, SON OF STONE, which featured Indians vs. dinosaurs and cavemen); or TERMINAL CITY... I could go on, but the point has been made. THE WATCHMEN is (and I'm still flush from having seen it, for what that's worth) the greatest realization of a comic book universe I've ever seen. The music beautifully underscores both the action and the dramatic twists and turns throughout; visually, it's simply stunning (the trailers on television do not do it justice); there's not a single bad performance- not one, from the Highest to the Lowest player. The direction could not be improved upon. Sex, politics, and rock and roll- all in one dynamite movie. You gotta see this one."
"dcbargas","8","0","2","10 March 2009"," ""Who watches the Watchmen?""
","I can't really say I am a big fan of Watchmen, since I read the book weeks before the release of this movie. I admit, the book was really good. And I was imagining how this movie could live up to the book. And like someone said in a recent review, this movie ""works"". Now I am a bit saddened about some scenes not making it to the final cut. But this movie works in it's own way. Let's just hope the director's cut has all the scenes from the book, if not, I don't care otherwise because I liked the movie anyways. I seen it with my girlfriend, and she really likes it too. Though I might accidentally spoil some parts from the movie, and for those who never read the book so I'm going to be brief about this. I want to start off with the actors first.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't know why everyone is complaining about Matthew Goode's portrayal of Adrian Veidt, also known as Ozymandias. There was nothing wrong with him, except for the fact that he doesn't look anything like the character from the book, but they made it work for the movie. As for Malin Akerman as Laurie Juspeczyk, also known as Silk Spectre II, wasn't bad at all either. She played the character the way I imagined her in the movie. I didn't see anything wrong with her at all, or Carla Gugino who plays as her mother in the film. They were both great in their scenes together.<br/><br/>Now on with the rest. Patrick Wilson, as the second Nite Owl (a.k.a. Dan Dreiberg), was terrific, Billy Crudup was perfect as the role of Dr. Manhattan, a.k.a. Jon Osterman, even though for the most part he was CGI but he made the character believable. Jeffrey Dean Morgon (a.k.a. Robert Downey Jr. look-a-like) does a great performance as the Comedian, a.k.a. Edward ""Eddie"" Blake. And last, but not least, Jackie Earle Haley IS Rorschach, also known as Walter Kovacs. He completely dove into the role, and became the character. He was really terrific.<br/><br/>Now on of what I like and dislike about the movie; I like all the scenes with Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). The character was so amazing. I like how they did it perfectly of maintaining the source, and not screwing most of it up. Except the ending, which I can accept. I never really liked the ""squid"" ending in the book (oops I said too much), that never made sense to me. The actors were all good, I didn't have a problem with any of them.<br/><br/>Now what I dislike about the movie; There were parts that I was hoping to see in the movie that was in the book. Hopefully we see these scenes in the director's cut. I am looking forward to it. But that's the only problems I had with this movie. And also, this movie might not make sense to anyone who never read the book. So be careful before you watch it, and don't expect too much. And I kind of felt this movie was rushed a bit, but that's probably because all those good scenes from the book were cut out and are saved for the director's cut.<br/><br/>Just to finish off, this is not an action-packed movie. I know that ever since I read the book. The previews for this movie made it look like it's going to have a lot of cool action scenes in it. The action scenes were short, which I don't mind because it wasn't suppose to be like X-Men, Spider-Man, Blade, etc. It's a suspense, thriller, and mystery movie. That's why I love the book because I like those type of stories that completely surprises you later on. The love the book, and this movie. This is an entertaining movie, and even if you don't like it, see it again for no reason...or read the book. Doesn't matter which I suppose.<br/><br/>This was such a cool day for me. I got to spend time with my girlfriend, got a Watchmen T-shirt, the book before I went to see the movie, and seen the movie I've been waiting for since last year. This was such an amazing day, and it couldn't be anymore better. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>""Who watches the Watchmen?"""

There was just one problem that I could find: The Mask Killer. For one thing(spoiler) Hollis Mason wasn't murdered. There wasn't a huge hype when Manhattan left Earth. No one hinted at the fact that Veidt's attempted assassination might have something to do with superhero murders. It didn't really feel like there was a mask killer.

","I saw the trailer in December 2008 and just waited for the movie to be released. But after I saw it i was so disappointed. The so called superheroes have really no superpower except the blue dude.. the only thing that makes the film worth watching is the special effects which really rock. The movie tends to be boring sometimes with dull dialogs like the one silk specter has with Dr Manhattan on mars trying to convince him to save the planet.The movie has the same idea as "" The day the earth stood still"" and at some point you just wish for the movie to end, the duration is way too long. The lines are quite hilarious sometimes and the action is kind of childish. Silk spectre and Nite Owl look like batman and robin clones, they ride a silly ship that looks like a giant jellyfish.. And in the end Dr Manhattan sacrifices his honor and one of his friends for world peace.. World Peace..sounds like miss congeniality.. The movie is quite a waste of time, except the effects that remind you of the movie ""300"" It could have been such a good film if the director had more imagination. Despite the rate it has on IMDb, the movie has nothing spectacular or breathtaking."
"JimmyZappa","8","0","2","8 March 2009"," People will look up and shout ""MAKE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE NOVEL""
","... and i'll whisper ""would you like fries with that too?"" <br/><br/>By now we've heard it all. Based on the most celebrated graphic novel. From the visionary director of 300. Is this movie gonna be good or a pile of...well, you know. Well, the movie officially hit theaters yesterday. It's, not surprisingly, in the IMDb Top 250 and Moore faithfuls have either been saying 'its a faithful adaptation' or 'boycott this filth, it's not worth seeing.' Not to mention mega nerds arguing if its comparable to last year's The Dark Knight or Sin City.<br/><br/>I will say if you want to watch a movie, there is no better time than now. I mean its either this or the Jonas Brothers 3D IMAX. It's thought provoking, visually booming, well-acted, and....extremely condensed. That's hardly a surprise though. Director Zack Snyder, of Dawn of the Dead remake and 300 fame, was hellbent trying to keep this page-by-page faithful as much as he could. And for those who wish for such a thing, he did a good job for the most part. Not every scene was kept sacred though, most notably there are some action scenes thrown in there to keep the audience from getting totally bored. <br/><br/>Visually its stunning, so I won't go too much into that. Just know you won't be disappointed on how it looks from beginning to end. One of the things I found surprising was the action. I've never seen kung-fu moves as fast and furious in a superhero film before. While few and very far in between, they were the major highlights. The climax in particular has some of the more impressive shots I ever laid eyes on. Mind you, this is all to keep the audience's attention. There's no such depiction in the graphic novel of Rorschach karate kicking Oxy-moron (or whatever his name is) but is so damn sweet seeing it in this movie. Christopher Nolan, if you want to do another Batman: TAKE NOTES. This is what the action should've been like. Not only was it clean and fast, it was coherent. Cubby Broccoli's children should also takes notes to avoid another Quantum of Solance catastrophe.<br/><br/>It's also no surprise that Jackie Earl Haley as Rorschach is a match made in heaven. It's one of the most impressive ""he-is-the-character"" choices since Heath Ledger as the Joker. In fact I have to say he's a solid number 2. There is never a dull moment whenever he is Rorschach or the fragile Walter Kovacs. What did surprise me was Dr. Manhattan, who sports the biggest distraction in movie history. I mean wow, that's a lot of blue trouser snake. Enough to give it its own co-star mention. But *ahem*, back to the point...what I thought was one of the dullest characters in the novel was actually one of the more interesting ones in the movie. His back story was executed very well and I think it was the turning point of the movie. Before, it was getting pretty dull and slow (minus the Rorschach scenes) but once his story hit it really started to pick up. And it was a fun ride from there. Niteowl II was also a surprise, the character was delightfully entertaining to watch on screen. The audience and I laughed at his offbeat jokes and nerdiness, he was just an extremely likable character. Silk Spectre II was...hmm, alright I guess. People say she was so bad she almost killed the movie. I think that's an exaggeration. She did her part but it wasn't as compelling as her castmates. I think the worst character was Nixon. Man, every time he appeared we are taken out of the movie and me and my buds laughed our asses off. I think his nose was bigger than Manhattan's blue rocket.<br/><br/>Speaking of out of place, I have to mention the soundtrack. The orchestrated soundtrack was just fine but omg...in choice events, for reasons beyond me, they decided to play random classic rock tunes out of nowhere. The beginning had a Bob Dylan song (*shudder*) and when they reach the fortress in the climax they tuned in Hendrix's cover of ""All Along the Watchtower"" (which funnily enough is a Bob Dylan song as well). That was pretty cheesy and it took us out of the movie every time. There are two more examples i'm missing, one was an '80s pop song. If they didn't do that, the movie wouldn't have suffered. They should've put that Muse song from the trailers in there somewhere.<br/><br/>And to mention the story one more time, I was happy to see the climax remained the same (even if a bit simplified...obviously) including that one unhappy moment. If you're a fan, you know what it is. Everyone was bummed but it was necessary. Halfway through, the movie was a joy to watch. It's like they found the balance and kept with it. Kind of a shame it wasn't like that for the whole movie, but hey. That's the way it goes. I was thinking of giving it a low 7 but bumped it up to a higher 7, near 8, cause of that. Overall if you don't expect anything more than what it is, a movie that tries to emulate the source as much as possible, you'll think its good. It's short comings don't make it great but its accomplishments don't make it suck either.<br/><br/>7.6/10"

They cannot, for example, do introspection in an instant.<br/><br/>Neither form has proved adept at pre-digesting expository lumps.<br/><br/>Either form, at its best, can amaze, inspire, thrill, or move us.<br/><br/>It's a challenge to adapt either medium to the other. Steven Gould's marvelous novel Jumper became a wretched film of the same name. Conversely, about the best you can say of any novelization from a script (even one in the hands of a highly competent author) is ""It was workmanlike."". Not that a good cross-medium adaptation can't be done at all, just that the odds are stacked against it. So many things have to come together just right that it's like lightning striking twice in the same place.<br/><br/>The shining exception to this rule is, of course, The Lord of the Rings, an acknowledged literary masterpiece that could have been just horribly, horribly botched as a movie. But it had the good fortune to fall into the hands of friends, and the result was a masterpiece in its own right. (Bless you, Peter Jackson. And uncountable thanks to New Line Cinema, which literally bet the studio on you.)<br/><br/>Adding to the normal problems of adaptation are the added challenges associated with science fiction and fantasy. These genres get no respect in either realm.<br/><br/>Consider what it takes to win praise from literary critics. If you crank out a novel about an angst-ridden Jewish writer who lives in New York City, you're almost automatically on the short list for that year's top prizes in fiction.

About the sole SF&F work to crack this inner circle was Michael Chabon's wondrously written Pulitzer Prizewinning alternative history, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, which happened to be about angst-ridden Jewish comic-book writers who lived in New York City. (It probably helped that one of them turned out to be gay.)<br/><br/>Hollywood is just as dismissive of the genre, tho it's more of a love-hate relationship here. After all, 80 of the top 100 box-office movies of all time have been either science fiction or fantasy. Money, sure; keep it rolling in! But respect? A different story altogether. Look at 2008's crop of terrific comic-book films. What would it take for any of them to get an Oscar nomination? Would they have had to kill to get one? No; that's an exaggeration. You do have to die, tho. Clearly, from the movie industry's perspective, SF&F flix are like the good-time gal you hang out with as much as possible, not the one you take home to mom.<br/><br/>And, if these 2 establishments look down their snoots at SF&F generally, they are even more contemptuous of comic books. Even when comics are collated into more substantial form (in an appeal to ""weightiness"") and recategorized as ""graphic novels"" (in a desperate attempt to evade ""comicness""), they start out with a strike against them due solely to their roots. Maus, Watchmen, Fun House, Persepolis. I'm not out of fingers on my 1st hand yet, and I can't think of any others that ever got taken seriously. It's like the sad old story about women and black people struggling to make it in America: Due to mindless bigotry, you have to be twice as good to get half as far.<br/><br/>I suspect that part of the explanation for this lack of respect lies in the 1-dimensional axis along which standard fiction gets evaluated. At one end of the spectrum lies Plot; at the other, Characterization. English classes, film schools, and lit crit all go on endlessly about the proper balance between these 2 poles. I submit that, like A. Square in Flatland, they are oblivious to an entire additional dimension. A thoro analysis requires us to expand that 1-dimensional axis into a 2-dimensional triangle by adding a 3rd vertex, Setting.<br/><br/>""It had begun misting as she stepped out of the cab in front of the Waldorf-Astoria."" 1 sentence into your novel, and your readers already know a wealth of information about your world. Had it been a movie, the establishing shot would have burned Setting into their brains even more quickly. Because the familiar is handled so readily in mimetic fiction, it's taken for granted by the critics and scholars.<br/><br/>SF&F, tho, have a larger burden to shoulder. For them, Setting is on a par with Plot and Characterization as something that must be dealt with. It's necessary to create a whole different world for these genres, and doing so takes pages and frames that can't be devoted to the other 2 vertices of the triangle. Thus, to a standard 1-dimensional critique, these genres seem to skimp on the elements that mainstream critics are predisposed to look for.<br/><br/>SF&F fans, of course, are accustomed to letting their eyes roam across the whole triangle of creative space. That's why they can find delight in, say, the works of Arthur C. Clarke, which revel in new worlds built or discovered by cardboard-cutout characters. Doing right by Setting makes up somewhat for sins of Plot and Characterization. But only in the cloistered ghetto of SF&F, not in the great outer world.<br/><br/>You might think that graphic novels would be an ideal bridge between books and movies. After all, they partake of the time-decoupled, info-dense, and cerebral (both senses) aspects of the novel as well as of the immediacy, activity, and audio-visuality of film.<br/><br/>So much more to say, but I'm up against the 1000-word limit. Ah, well, that's what blogs are for."

What bothers me is the general content, it (like my summary says) good, not great. If you plan on going to see this know that you are going to get a lot more politics thrown at you more than the general ""superhero"" movie has to offer, if I had known that I probably would have enjoyed it more.<br/><br/>On another note, it was visually outstanding, special effects really shine and many of the action sequences had me cringe at the sheer brutality of it. The characters were all believable and some very real (and others not so much ha ha).<br/><br/>I recommend everyone go see this just for the sake of seeing it it deserves that at least, keep an open mind in the context the film presents and also be warned this is a film you probably shouldn't take your kids to or go on a first date to, it does get gory at a point or two."

","It is really amazing how a movie like Watchmen could be so pretty, so true to the book and yet, so Unenjoyable. In retrospect however, it isn't as surprising.<br/><br/>While ""Watchmen"" is a humanist story about the various aspects of human soul, Zack Snyder is an expert on gore, style, visuals (""Sin City"") and raising the testosterone of viewers to illegal levels (""300″). He is not, however, someone who can give a soul to comics heroes.<br/><br/>Zack did everything he could, but it just isn't his kind of movie. Despite the ""comixie"" appearance, ""Watchmen"" should be done by a director who excels in moving the audience, not one who excels in exciting them. Instead of Zack Snyder, Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer, this movie should've been directed by Todd Solondz or Darren Aronofsky."

","To anyone who knows anything about comic books, Watchmen is the best of them all. It is a multi-layered, dark read which tackles themes such as the Cold War, the dark side of human character and deconstruct the superhero mythos.<br/><br/>Watchmen starts with the murder of Eddie Blake/the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in an excellent fight scene and has a four minute opening credit scene looking at the quick history of the world of Watchmen. The film is set in an alternative verison of 1985 where America is more powerful because they have the only real superhero, Doctor Manhattan, (Billy Crudup) who radically changed America's industry and military complexes. This is a world where superheroes did exist and have been outlawed by the American government. A world where America won in Vietnam, but also a world where America and the Soviet Union were edging towards war. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is the only superhero still working illegally and he investigates the Comedian's assassination. He believes that they is a masks killer, but he is also famous for being a paranoid conspiracy nut. However his suspicions are confirmed when Doctor Manhattan exiles himself because of claims he gave people he used to work with cancer and he himself has lost interest in humanity and then an assassination attempt on Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode). Rorschach himself gets arrested for murder and its left to Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) and Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) to stop the world from destroying itself.<br/><br/>After a number of director being attached to the film, including Terry Gilliam who claimed the graphic novel was unfilmable, fan-boy Zack Sydner took the challenge. He has done challenges before, he made a good remake of Dawn of the Dead and the very entertaining 300. He wanted to make the film as loyal as possible to the book. He did have to cut some of the subplots, but the ending was changed and the focus of the film seemed to be on Doctor Manhattan rather then Rorschach. Even Rorschach's origins seemed to be skipped over, and that was my favourite chapter in the graphic novel. The actions scene sinces were done excellent, similar in style to 300, especially the fight scene in prison. There are also easter eggs for Watchmen fans. However the end of the film was changed and there were areas that were skipped over or changed a bit too much. As well some of the CGI was a bit too obvious.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley was perfect as Rorschach, getting the look and the voice right and he was the best actor in the film. Patrick Wilson was good as Nite Owl and Billy Crudup did well with the monotone Doctor Manhattan. I thought Matthew Goode wasn't so good, he had a strange lisp and he lacked the charisma that Ozymandias and Malin Akerman was the weakest performer in the film.<br/><br/>The Daily Mail critic criticised the fact that the Comedian killed a pregnant woman and tried to rape the original Silk Spectre and that Rorschach killed a man for murdering a six-year-old girl. That is the whole point. There are not superheroes in the traditional scene, they are all faulted and some are not very nice people. Their political views range from a strange type of liberal to neo-conservative to fascist. The whole point is to de-construct the superhero mythos. The film is violence, sexual and you get a lot of blue willy action. It's is a strong 15/18 rated film.<br/><br/>Watchmen is decent, but it does change a bit too much for Watchmen fans, and will be hard to appeal to non-fans. You should read the graphic novel first and maybe it might be worth waiting for the 3 and half hour director's cut."
"lofu_x","7","0","6","9 March 2009"," WATCHMEN!? More like WATCHSEVEN!
","Firstly, I must say that I have read The Watchmen novel about 3 months in advance due to the very effective Watchmen trailer (Smashing Pumpkins song was perfectly used). I must say that this film was good but had a lot of near crippling flaws.<br/><br/>I'll start with the bad. The acting was horrid. Especially bad for Silk Spector, and passable to mostly terrible from the other actors. Many of them you could tell were struggling with the dialogue (or shall we say adherence to the source material). I'm still debating if this the result of Snyder not being able to get performances out of an actor, a victim of a bad script, or generally just bad casting. Either way, it definitely hurt the character driven scenes of which most of the movie is made up of.<br/><br/>The length (or shall we say adherence to the source material again) was at a whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is hard to do right even in the hands of a crafted director, and near impossible for an unproven director in Zack Snyder. The movie draws many of its scenes and lines from the movie. Not much is left out. And not much is rewritten or adapted. And this lack of adaptation is the main source of many of this movie's flaws. Nothing was edited out, and the dialog could have been sped up to keep the flow of the movie going, not to mention sound more real. Zack Snyder said he wanted to do Watchmen right, and I think that's what most fans wanted of the novel wanted and he did a great job with that.<br/><br/>Despite what was done wrong with the movie, there are still things that make it worth a watch (if your not a fan). The most notable being that the original novel presents such a clever and interesting premise, that really should be experienced in one form or another.<br/><br/>The visual style looked nice and shiny. The production was really top notch. The lighting looked right, the costumes, and the set design were great. Snyder's tried and true slow motion is mostly well used throughout the film. If you liked the slow motion fight scenes of 300 you can expect the same for Watchmen. The action scenes just like those in 300 look nice, and offer up some new ideas, but in the end are nothing really notable.<br/><br/>But, as a movie it didn't quite come out as was to be hoped. With a skilled writer I do believe the Watchmen could have been a great movie, but it needed to be better adapted to the film. The flow of the novel was just not suitable for a film. The novel employs a somewhat clever deployment of back stories and transitions but they did not emphasize the characters as much as you'd expect from a movie. The audience was not attached to the characters because of a lack of focus or emphasis of the characters in the script.<br/><br/>I give this movie a low 7s rating. Let's say 7.3, not a higher seven because of the the penis to boobie scene ratio?"
"quan2dary","7","0","5","8 March 2009"," Good As Could Be Expected
","Watchmen is often referred to as the ""unadaptable comic."" Zack Snyder effectively proved his critics wrong with this; this adaptation (excepting the omission of the Tales of The Black Freighter and other impossibilities) is almost slavishly faithful to the comic until its very end. <br/><br/>First the bad: sometimes, Snyder's faithfulness may not have been the best idea: the movie takes the majority of its dialogue from the book, and the endless scenes of exposition tend to either get lost in translation or just bore. The action scenes don't disappoint, but they often interrupt the mood and pacing of the movie; they seem to have been thrown in merely to satisfy the blood- hungry viewer. Malin Akerman is sexy but wooden as Silk Spectre; as many reviewers have noted, she seems to be the weak link in the cast. Matthew Goode as Ozymandias, the world's smartest man, is simply annoying; he has a barely detectable accent that grated on my nerves, and, instead of seeming intelligent, he just seems like a smirking douche. While most of the movie is good, at times it just seems to drag on: at 2 hours and 40 minutes it's no task for the faint of heart, and it fails to keep even the most faithful eyes focused the whole time.<br/><br/>However, when the movie does glue your eyes to the screen, it uses a hot glue gun. The very opening of the movie is brilliant; over the credits, a montage shows the rise and fall of ""The Minutemen,"" a superhero team, and the alternate world they created. Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach is reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker, capturing a truly skewed worldview in a way that the viewer can't help but be attracted to: this is one instance where lifting material directly from the comic book (almost all of Rorschach's lines) was a great decision. Patrick Wilson satisfies as the impotent, schlubby Dan Dreiberg (Nite Owl), and Billy Crudup's performance as Dr. Manhattan, a man who, in a nuclear accident, becomes like a god, is fascinating- his voice toneless and almost ethereal, you can hear his gradual detachment and alienation from the human world. The cinematography and effects are amazing- the film is simply beautiful, no other way to put it.<br/><br/>So there you have it. Zack Snyder deserves respect for taking on this Goliath of a project; his love for the subject is obvious in every frame of the film, and though his dedication occasionally causes the film to plod, the good moment of the film make it clear that it was worth it. Though it has its fair share of flaws, this movie is at least definitely worth watching."
"d_mccauley","7","0","6","8 March 2009"," Faithful to the Graphic Novel
","I read the graphic novel Watchmen for the first time the day before seeing the film adaptation. I felt it was important to take in the story Alan Moore had created in the way he had envisioned it before seeing it adapted by somebody else. Having done this, the film version held few surprises. I wouldn't say that the lack of surprises isn't necessarily a bad thing, but rather it means that the film closely follows the original graphic novel. I think the film will please ardent fans who have been waiting to see the story on the big screen. CGI is now at a point where it can do justice this story justice, and even the scene on Mars was fairly well done. The violence in the film was appropriate (this is definitely not a film for children) considering part of the story is about these superheroes that are borderline sociopaths. What I felt was lacking in the film was in the socio-political commentary that was prominent in the book. It was definitely touched on in the film version, but it felt softened in the film as if to say the action was more important. I feel that this political side seems to be an important part of Alan Moore's work. In all, I have never been a big fan of graphic novels adapted into film, but I felt that the film version of Watchmen was entertaining and will make fans happy."
"TurboBadgerx2","7","0","5","8 March 2009"," A beautifully, flawed, mess of a film.
","First off, I'd like to bring to attention that I've never read the graphic novel, so I will not tackle what they missed, left out, or didn't get right in the translation process. Watchmen is a beautifully shot, stylized, well directed, mess of a film. The film manages to splash new life on the superhero genre, it fails in delivering the messages and metaphors that were spread about the graphic novel, from what I've heard and read of. There is many, many underlying ""plots"", if you will, that are only dimly focused upon. You'll easily catch wind of these, but will feel unsatisfied when the conclusion of the majority of the underlying aspects are either forgotten about or wrapped up terribly. It's the same equivalent of being told you're going to have sex and either have very unsatisfying foreplay or not getting anything at all.<br/><br/>The acting is all over the place. Where some actors, such as Jackie Earle Haley, BIlly Crudup, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Patrick Wilson deliver powerful, touching, and deep performances, the remaining cast either portrays their character as one of a soup opera or of a first time acting job. It's completely obvious that Jackie Earle Haley steals the show away from everyone with his portrayal of the psychotic Rorschach. His tone, his expressions-- facial and bodily, give the character the tiniest but genius nudge in the right direction.<br/><br/>The slow-motion trademark of director Zach Synder gets old almost directly after the opening credit montage. The effect works flawlessly in the opening scene of The Comedian's demise. It also gives the montage a very campy, but nice touch, making it stand out as one of the many highlights in the whole picture. After those two back-to-back scenes, the effect is used only to give the film a more stylish, modernized feel, which ultimately brings the film down...a lot. We've seen this song and dance numerous times, we don't need to see it again.<br/><br/>The ""new"" ending works with the film in ways that the original couldn't. It adds more emotion and character to the characters involved in it. The message is put across ten times better than it would had the original ending stayed. I've read constantly that this ending is the biggest flaw in many people's eyes, which I can't understand. Using the original ending in this film would just make the campiness of the film go overboard.<br/><br/>Also, the pacing at times is perfect, while at other times, the editor needed to be addressed more than they were.<br/><br/>Overall, Watchmen has many flaws throughout it, but also has enough to hold it high up as one of the best films of 2009 to date. It left a dirty taste in my mouth for a few hours upon viewing, but later settled in. While I enjoyed the movie for the most part, reading that this is the closest depiction of the graphic novel we'll ever get just makes me believe that it shouldn't have been made. There's so much room for improvement that it'll frustrate even the casual of viewers.<br/><br/>Enter the theater with caution."
"movielover-46","8","0","4","8 March 2009"," The perils of adaptation
","This last Friday (12am showing thank you very much) I saw the highly anticipated moving-picture adaptation of seminal graphic novel Watchmen. Making this movie was a unique enterprise in that it was not just another comic book movie, but from the onset, publicized itself as being as faithful as possible to the source material.<br/><br/>This poses a problem for the director, in that the material was itself a piece of visual storytelling, and what, if anything, does a director need if not a unique vision. It seems fittingly poetic that the main flaw of the movie was that its director tried to prove that he was a necessary element of the production -- Gibbons should have received a director credit because of the number of sequences that were lifted directly from his illustrations.<br/><br/>The only place that the Snyder seems to have had visual input was the extension of some fight sequences and the unnecessary gratuity of female nudity. (The blue nudity makes perfect sense for the character and is part of the source material.) Which is blatantly an attempt to keep what, without the massive existing fan-boy base, would be it's target demographic, teenage boys, happy.<br/><br/>What fan-boys already know is that Watchmen is more complex than a typical super-hero story. Contained with it's 12 issues were the ""origin stories"" of half dozen characters, the the sketching of a parallel history where the US was not unsuccessful in Vietnam, the zeitgeist of impending nuclear doomsday, an exploration of existential determinism, the duality of female characters in the medium and a pirate story.<br/><br/>Even at almost three hours, the movie could not possibly keep all this detail, but I was happy to say that it got most of the high-points right. (The ""Black Freighter"" meta-comic looks to be an extra on the DVD.) The characterizations of Rorschach and Night Owl were particularly well rounded, and with the emergence of motion capture technology as a viable tool for enhancing performances a new Oscar category seems ripe for Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan to take home (or to become model for).<br/><br/>The art direction and FX were awesome and I was happy to see so much of the novel brought to greater detail. But while it was good to see these drawing brought to life; the conceit of the mission statement, bring the graphic novel to the screen, was its greatest flaw. (My review of 300 compared it to an animated David painting.) While the serial novel poses its own sets of problems, Moore worked well within those to make each issue sufficiently self contained, but still be contained enough momentum to give each issue a cliffhanger. I think that the movie stayed to close to that narrative pattern, so that there seemed to be a sort of climax every twenty minuets or so. It would have been better if the screenwriters could have adjusted the pacing a bit for a more cohesive arc.<br/><br/>While I will confess an appreciation of multiple chronology storytelling, found that, on screen, the lack of narrative pattern to be jarring. I remember my first exposure to Moore's work and having an immediate affinity for his ability to collapse and expand narrative time, which I later realized had been learned from the best of the 20th century, Woolfe, Joyce and Proust. Their lessons: the past is never really past and that writing allows anyone to be their own version Dr. Manhattan. (I'd be happy to be half as sexy without hair as Billy Blue. Sitting in a theatre however is not the same as sitting in an armchair and the movie cannot function in that same temporal environment.<br/><br/>Pacing is just one way that a movie needs to be different than a book. The most successful adaptations understand this and edit accordingly. The few movies that have been better than the books from which they were taken apply a light approach to their sources. (example: Cider House Rules and Wonder Boys.) Taking so much directly from the series chopped up the action and the addition of unnecessary sequences dragged out run time.<br/><br/>However I am happy to say that one small detail was changed that I completely agree with; changed I assume because, even for a super-hero movie that postulates a consciousness made up something other than a brain, it was just to far fetched to believe. The original story used this as a way to make a conspiracy once discovered implausible to those who would read of it in Rorschach Journal. (I too am glad that was kept Justin.) Other reviews I'd categorize into those that applaud the reverence, those that applaud the direction that the movie takes the superhero genre and those that were annoyed by Akerman's inadequate performance. I'll give it 3.25 stars B- only because it tried to please the wrong audience - those fan-boys slavishly praising the faithful transcription - but movies being the business they are, that was maybe a wise decision."

","Watchmen is another comic book movie. The book it is based on, published in the mid-80's, was one of the biggest reasons that comics became more mature and mainstream. Today, every comic character seems to be a hot property for film adaptations, and the movies being made from this genre are getting more and more sophisticated. Watchmen was directly responsible for the beginning of this trend. <br/><br/>The comic was written more for adults than kids, so this ends up being rated ""R."" Anyone trying to decide whether or not to watch--or let their kids watch it--should know it is what they call a ""hard R,"" which means that there is a lot of stuff going all through the movie that contributes to that rating: language, violence, nudity, and mature situations. I took my wife, not really expecting her to like it much, especially since she doesn't really enjoy gory violence. Her comment, watching what she assumed was a superhero movie, was ""I don't see any heroes.""<br/><br/>I'm not usually big on gore either, but one of the things I enjoyed most was the savagery of the character Rorshach. Chopping heads, frying faces, taking on groups of cops alone--you just want to watch this guy go nuts. Maybe there should never be a sequel, but it's impossible not to want to see more of Rorshach. <br/><br/>I enjoyed most of the choices in this movie. The opening credits were especially rewarding with all the blink-and-you'll-miss-it cultural references. A couple things that did bother me: Carla Guigino (who I usually like) and Matt Frewer were TERRIBLE. Their acting belonged in a bad soap opera. And some of the makeup was poorly done. Carla, again, as an elderly woman worked about as well as the Wayans' in White Chicks. Matt Frewer looked more like something out of Narnia. And the guy playing Nixon was the most cartoonish. <br/><br/>Also, a lot of the pop songs chosen for this movie have been overused in other soundtracks. The one that worked best was ""The Times They Are-A Changin."" What they did with that song gave it a whole new meaning. But ""Sounds of Silence"" and ""All Along The Watchtower"" felt like clichés.<br/><br/>The other choice that will have fans divided is the ending. In the book, a giant monster destroys New York. In the movie, we are told that several cities were bombed. I would have rather seen the monster.<br/><br/>Watchmen might be one of the most faithful scripts in any movie ever adapted from a book. It went a little long, some of the casting was off, and some of the costumes weren't that good, but I liked it enough to watch it again."
"amy_breitag","8","0","2","8 March 2009"," My Review
","I was really impressed on how Zach Snyder recreated the comic in almost perfection. He really stayed as close as possible to the comic, including costume/clothing design, dialog, and set design. Most to almost all of the shots in the movie were exactly how the comic illustrated the scene. <br/><br/>I did notice a few difference in the movie when compared to the first chapter of the comic. For example, the comic starts out by informing the viewer about the comedian's death in the Cop's P.O.V., and in the movie you get to see it from The Comedian's. When Rorschach goes to investigate the murder, the movie depicts him searching the apartment for a while before heading to the closet, while in the graphic novel he heads straight to the closet, almost as if he knows exactly where to look. The movie never shows Rorschach writing in his journal, which the comic makes a point of doing. Also the bar scene is different, in the movie Dan (Night Owl) accompanies Rorschach, and in the comic Rorschach is alone. The movie depicts Lori and Dan enjoying dinner on ground level, the comic shows them on a roof. Jon also tells Lori that she is going to have dinner, in the book she tells him.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge reader/fan of comic books or graphic novels, but I love watching the adaptations of them into film. Something about the film gives the characters and story so much life, if depicted in the right way and the director knows what they're doing. The Watchmen is a wonderful example of a director staying as true as possible to the story, and creating a beautiful work of art at the same time."

","This is a review from yours truly and I haven't read the graphic novel WATCHMEN and the movie adaptation.. well, let's just say that it's stylish and visually breathtaking and those are its strongest points. There's too much character development, I think it could've been trimmed down and we're still fresh from having watched the great Dark Knight that all of WATCHMEN dark, gloomy profundity and depth in the complexity of its story seem like just an average attempt to do the same. I don't mind the movie's strong graphic violence, in fact, if Zack Snyder had took it down a notch, it would've took away what's left of its wow factor.<br/><br/>I don't deny the power of this movie's visual effects. Stunning doesn't even begin to express how amazed I am at the ability to take your sight to all kinds of exciting levels. It's as if the effects used in Zack Snyder's 300 was injected with steroid and there you have WATCHMEN. I'm also equally impressed with the cinematography and although I didn't read the book, I gotta hand it to Zack Snyder and his team for coming up with shots that you just know are comic-book like, it goes to show the extent they're willing to take to satisfy the fans. Granted, some say the ending was changed, be that as it may but it doesn't take away the fact that it is obvious that they also want to cater to those who've never read the book and that is also the downside, resulting in a running time that's just too damn long for a movie watching experience.<br/><br/>Having said that, the whole bullet time effects or where things get faster and slower and faster again in one single frame happens way too often, you'd get tired of it after the second hour. I'm aware that Zack Snyder wants to introduce each character's origin story especially to those not familiar with WATCHMEN but each of those stories could've been done in a much faster, less dramatic manner. The song selections for the most part are not too shabby, except for one particular sex scene and the soundtrack song 'Hallelujah'. It throws me off because they don't compliment each other. You see Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman thrusting and moaning meanwhile the song in the background just doesn't fit the mood. It's borderline hilarious. Keeping in mind again, I've never read the book.. so I guess what makes me not want to stand up and applaud is its supposed prophetic relation to 9/11 conspiracy, of how one disaster is secretly designed and massively executed in order to unite nations. I understand that the whole storyline is covered with political messages but that one just gets a bit too obvious and too preachy.<br/><br/>Actingwise I think all of them give great performances, Jeffrey Dean Morgan surprisingly is excellent as a man who's done some terrible things in his life and when he figures out an even bigger more terrible masterplan, his conscience gets the better of him. Top honor goes to Jackie Earl Haley who plays Rorschach, quite possibly the most badass of all WATCHMEN characters. Before I forget, the fight choreography is amazing. When they fight, you can almost feel like the wind just got knocked out of you. Is WATCHMEN in the same level as Zack Snyder's previous movie 300? It's arguable, but WATCMEN could certainly have been much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>--Rama's SCREEN--"

","It is tough to declare who is responsible for Watchmen. On one side is director Zack Snyder who has given us films such as the remake of Dawn of the Dead and comic adaptation 300. Certainly in the movie 300 we see Snyder's style with that slowed down, quick pan or zoom and loads of blood. He is not afraid of blood. Arguably Snyder his style has been defined from 300. Snyder vowed that for Watchmen he would be using the graphic novel's book panels as his storyboard and his bible. For the most part the film is what it appears to be which is a pretty faithful rendition of the novel. The film is an emotional, gripping story with visuals that are riveting. Mesmerizing film-making.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1985, masked vigilantes have been outlawed. Edward Blake is attacked in his apartment by and intruder. He is thrown thrown through window and falling to his death, he remarks, grinning, ""Life's a joke"". Following this sequence is a montage of historical scenes painting an alternate history from World War II through the 1980s. The montage includes historical events such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the Vietnam War. Due to the success of the Vietnam war, Richard Nixon is shown to be elected to his third term as President. Even though they have been outlawed the Watchmen are brought together again.<br/><br/>Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the only one with real superpowers. He lives outside ordinary time and space. Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the world's smartest man. The Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is isolated from life by his mastery of technology. Rorshach (Jackie Earl Haley) finds meaning in patterns that may only exist in his mind. And Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) lives with one of the most familiar human challenges, living up to her parents, in this case the original Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino). Dr. Manhattan is both her lover and a distant father figure living in a world of his own.<br/><br/>The Watchmen suffer what all superheroes have faced. How their humanity comes into play against their super powers and how their super powers can interfere with humanity. What kind of non-super lives can the superhero live and why are they both hated and revered at the same time. Fundamental questions that have plagued most superheroes of any depth in reality. The one caveat is Batman because he is so human and must rely on his human side in order to feed his super human desires. And what about Dr. Manhattan? Does he even remember what it is like to be human and is he doing his part in this for some kind of human feeling he has deep within himself.<br/><br/>Like a superhero I was also torn between two worlds while going to see Watchmen on the big screen. Half of me wanted to see a good movie while the other half wanted to side with Alan Moore and wish for the film to be a big pile of crap. Writer Alan Moore. Alan Moore has refused to have his name on the movie (ditto its Moore-based predecessors, ""V for Vendetta"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") and he has declined all reimbursement in an effort to protest the entertainment industry's fundamental lack of respect for intellectual property. He too is like a torn superhero. I admire Moore for his inner morality.<br/><br/>I think that Zack Snyder has done a respectable treatment of Watchmen. It is a sharp movie largely due to the really great graphic novel the material has come from. I believe it is because the material was looked at as virtual storyboards that we get such a visceral movie. We can only hope to see more from both this writer and director."
"Carycomic","9","0","2","8 March 2009"," Everything that ""The Spirit"" should have been, but (sadly) wasn't.
","Alan Moore? You should be proud. Hollywood was actually 99% faithful to your graphic novel! The only thing they changed about it was the plot-device for averting World War III.<br/><br/>In the graphic novel, Ozymandias cloned and mutated the brain of a human psychic. A brain that had memorized certain unpublished s.f. stories, plus images of a diorama meant to resemble an extra-terrestrial landscape. Basically, a variation on ""The Architects of Fear,"" which was a classic episode of the original b/w OUTER LIMITS about a plot to unify the Earth through the global fear of an alien invasion from outer space. One that would never materialize, of course! But, one which the frightened people of the world couldn't take the _chance_ of never occurring.<br/><br/>And, I suspect that's the episode of OUTER LIMITS that was being aired on Dan's TV set , at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I paraphrase my opening statement, however, when I say that--in all other respects--Hollywood was surprisingly faithful to the source material. And, that delighted me, no end!"
"NotSureifthisis7734","9","0","3","8 March 2009"," Brilliant, beautiful, ugly, fascinating, baffling, thrilling, but where's the story?
","Let me start off by saying that don't believe anyone can fail to admire the sheer audacity of the Watchmen. Unlike, TDK which danced around the R-rating, but stuck with PG-13 to ensure the box office, this movie embraces the R. It runs with it. This movie is frightening enough in terms of sheer intensity of, well, everything, not just the violence. It will twist your stomach. It all but shouts the viewer to deal with it or leave. You got to like that.<br/><br/>Yet while I was all prepared to give a thoughtful review when I got home from the showing this morning, I couldn't do it. Thinking about this movie is the wrong way to approach it. Ebert says a movie is about feeling. It should be about more than feeling, it can be about more than feeling (think of Vertigo, a movie about as far removed from this one as you could imagine), but sometimes feeling is all you have. Fine. Watchmen is a visceral experience, one that overwhelms every other aspect of the film. Intellectually, the film makes little sense, even as satire. Ebert, for example, is carrying on in his reviews about quantum physics and the vistas, visual and otherwise, opened by Dr. Manhattan. I cannot think of a more wrong headed approach to this film. You want Quantum Mechanics? Read a book.<br/><br/>This movie is like a gut punch and a kick when you are down. You don't see it coming and as you are gasping for breath, you certainly do not see where it is going. To the movie's credit, so powerful are the feelings little else matters, but I will mention them anyway. There are great characters, so appealing I wanted to see them in their own movie -- I really liked Nite Owl and Silk Spectre, who together give the film what positive uplift it has. Rorsach? Of course. The visuals are amazing, the narrative drive seldom flags. And by those standards, I guess that is what you would call them, Watchman is fantastic. I can't recommend it enough, though leave the kids (and your girlfriend) at home. But as a story, I'm can't really comment. What is there to comment on? It's not there. Save the world, blah blah. Done that. There's something that might have been a story if the writers had been permitted to create one, but they weren't. That shadowy something, to be sure, is serviceable enough, but is as brittle as Dr. Manhattan's Mars contraption. Brilliantly edited, wonderful to behold, but it is crushed by a hurtling meteor of feelings. And if feeling is what you want, then for 2 and 3/4 hours this movie will transport you away from a world that is numbing, to somewhere.<br/><br/>Here's an example of what I mean. In this alternative history, sticking just with the opening montage, we see the Comedian, one of the ""SuperHeroes,"" (and one nasty dude) assassinate Kennedy. Why he does this we are never told. How he gets away with this we are never told. What are the implications of this horrendous crime in the Watchman universe, we never learn. This is not a minor narrative lapse. And don't shove the comic book in my face as I'm watching the movie. In a real film, this act would be crucial to understanding this very twisted character. It is not so much the lapse of taste (there are plenty of those), but a complete failure of story telling judgment. Of course, no one cares, certainly not audience I was with to whom the Kennedy assassination is as psychologically remote as the building of the pyramids. But to me it is bothersome. Again the movie attitude was -- got a problem with that? Go home. I stayed.<br/><br/>Admire the Watchmen for its daring, its courage, its brilliance. See the film for it astonishing polarities of beauty and ugliness, be fascinated by the characters, wonder at the scope of it all. But don't think about it. There's no story there."
"simonparker1990","10","0","2","8 March 2009"," As close an adaptation we could ever get
","Watchmen has often been referred to as the ""unfilmable text"", the comic so complex, so full of ideas and so intricately written that it could never realistically be filmed. To some extent I did agree with this, I only read the graphic novel last Novemember, but immediately I fell in love with it, and questioned how they could ever do the story justice. Well when I left the cinema last night, and for most of today, I have been questioning the film. When I left I acknowledged how amazing a movie it was, but I needed time to think on it. How the cuts of the novel worked, how the slight changes worked, and how the storyline flowed as a whole. It's literally only in the past hour that I have come to love the movie version as much as I do at the moment. Watchmen the movie is the closest adaptation we could ever hope for, realistically it could never be done to perfection, but to have something so close just shows how special a movie this is. I'm not saying this is as good as The Dark Knight, personally I will be amazed if I ever regard it to be as good, but what it is is the best superhero movie bar Dark Knight. Overlong it may be, slow it may be, but I wouldn't want it changed for the world, and I cannot wait to see the extended cut and watch this numerous times in the cinema.<br/><br/>Let me go onto the acting, as Watchmen in my eyes has always been a group effort in terms of characters. I will start with the best by far, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, whom was always my favourite character in the novel. Haley is perfect, there is no other word for it, I'm talking Ledger as Joker levels of perfection, arguably more so. He simply is Rorschach, both in and out of the mask. In fact his scenes in prison are probably some of my highlights. The voice is how I always imagined it, but the emotion in the character is something I never expected. I don't come close to crying in cinemas very often, but his very final scene, goddamn it had me damned close. Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl was pretty brilliant, never liked the character too much though to be honest. Malin Akerman is awful as Silk Spectre, no other way to put it. I dislike the character, but she's not a good actress. Matthew Goode is the biggest surprise for me, he looks nothing like Ozymandias, and really shouldn't work in the role (though they make his involvement too obvious), but the voice and his monologuing scenes are actually perfect. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is good, but amazing, as Eddie Blake, though he does feature in one of the best scenes. Billy Crudup is incredible as Manhattan, I'm not sure how much was effects, and how much was the actor doing motion capture, but the voice itself was brilliant for the character.<br/><br/>Now Watchmen is bigger than the characters, its all about the ideas and story in my eyes. The action is very much left to the background, that isn't to say there isn't any, in fact my slight moan is that they have amped some action up a tad too much. I disliked the Comedian's death at the beginning, the fight went on far too long and felt unnecessary. Some quick inter-cutting flashes of what happened would have more than sufficed. Thankfully the ideas still survive in the movie, and this of course brings me onto the ending. Here I forewarn you that there will be SPOILERS. Still reading? I'll assume you either want it spoiled or have seen the movie. Well there is no squid, not a bad move in my opinion as I always feared it would seem to bizarre for the average viewer. No instead we get an explanation of Manhattan being the alleged cause, which actually really works. In fact I loved the ending a lot, especially the aftermath, until we have one scene with Nite Owl and Ozymandias, which I absolutely hated. I mean I pretty much sat there screaming at the screen I hated it so much. But considering that was the one scene that really annoyed me I was pretty impressed with how they did the ending.<br/><br/>Any scene with Rorschach truly is a highlight of the movie, his final scene as I said it truly amazing how it is done, and his line ""You're trapped in here with me"" still remains my firm favourite of both the comic and the movie. Manhattan's scenes on Mars are truly beautiful, especially his final speech with Laura ""turning air into gold"". But arguably my favourite sequence in the entire movie happens in the first ten minutes. In fact it's the opening credits, done to Bob Dylan's ""The Times are A Changin"". For non-fans it might be meaningless, but for fans it will basically give them a geek-gasm.<br/><br/>Overall Watchmen is simply incredible, it does have issues, but I need to watch it over and over again to see how noticeable they really are. If you loved the novel you should love this, and if you don't then you need to understand that the novel can never be truly filmed scene for scene. This is the closest thing to the perfect Watchmen movie we will ever get, much as The Dark Knight is the closest thing to a perfect Batman movie we will ever get. This is a smart movie, and one that requires thinking and patience, if you can do that then prepare to be truly amazed."
"gazzo-2","7","0","4","8 March 2009"," Its okay, drags second half, worth seeing though.
","I never bothered reading the comics, back in the day--and though they're readily available, after seeing this, not sure if I want to. I liked the sheer volume of talent, money and detail that went into this productions-Rorschach, Owl and Comedian come off the best by far. Manhattan-well he's sorta the Silver Surfer, the Vietnam parts of this w/ him worked well. Some of the cast looked lost-Malin Akerman is getting razzed for her performance, I thought she was OK but brought nothing much besides a long set of legs to the role to be honest-and to be fair Matthew Goode as Ozzy was a joke. I thought his CGI Kat in fact gave a better performance.<br/><br/>(The less said about the Seriously goofy Nixon/Kissinger stuff, makeup, etc-the better. What the-?! spend some money to fix that guys--) Main problem w/ the movie is that it's slow and overlong, esp in the second half. You get the plot line down and know the characters fine-but expecting them to actually DO something besides letting nukes go off all over the world at the end-well...that's a disappointment to say the least.<br/><br/>Yes I'm aware of the alien squid from the comic. That-would have been just as bad.<br/><br/>So what am I saying? if you liked the GN, see it, if you liked 300 or Bats II: Dark Nitey--see it, if you liked Iron Man, see it-but remember Both Bats II and Iron Man were far better.<br/><br/>*** outta **** jest because."
"deastman_uk","7","0","3","7 March 2009"," Laughing at the Comedian
","Its getting a bit difficult to choose between making one long movie, splitting material between two or three films, or just doing a TV serial.<br/><br/>Watchmen mainly survives being packaged in one bundle. But the characters, the politics, the sexual politics and the plot begin to burst out of the seams. We are laughing when we should be in awe, and sometimes not laughing at the ironic humour.<br/><br/>The acting was good in parts - but slightly too many characters remained 2 dimensional. Because a film can only really work at one speed and level at a time, we are occasionally presented with stuff that doesn't scan.<br/><br/>But overall the film is entertaining throughout, and will challenge quite a few directors to risk more in what they deliver. But sometimes the format cannot frame the material.<br/><br/>And who would have expected DC to be doing so well in the film franchise war?"

","Visually stunning, with entire scenes that seem to jump out of the comic book. (It WAS a comic book people, it was not a graphic novel.) The casting most excellent,Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan and Patrick Wilson as Night Owl being particularly good. The only weak acting, (Or choice in acting) seems to come from Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, with him being portrayed in a far less heroic fashion, and more like a really arrogant big businessman.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the look of the film, and entire great sequences are brought to life, sometimes even better than the original source material.<br/><br/>I was however, left very cold by the ending. I will not ruin it here, but lets just say that it comes completely out of left field, with no clues or signs of its arrival. In the comic, every single issue had clues leading to why what was happening, was happening. In this movie it is just thrown out there, without any real attempt to build a mystery about it.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the original comics. I still own my original 12 bought back in 1986. This movie is a good attempt to try to bring that comic to the screen. Its not perfect, but well worth watching, especially for long time fans."

"fwomp","7","0","2","7 March 2009"," A Tough Call: Length, Dialogue, and Confusing Narration Take Away From The Overall Enjoyment
","The biggest challenge for directors and screenplay writers  who are forced to deal with significant source material  is to make a movie that'll appeal to a broad audience while not alienating those fans who love what the film's based on; in this case, The Watchmen graphic novels/comics created by Alan Moore. Released via DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, the twelve book limited series quickly developed a cult following thanks to the truly graphic nature in which superheroes were depicted. Artist Dave Gibson and colorist John Higgins gave readers gritty images that swerved far beyond the comfort zone of most graphic novel fans, giving us heroes with flaws so grand it would make Penthouse and Playboy Magazine editors blush.<br/><br/>The film rights for WATCHMEN were snapped up in 1986 and several production companies, directors, screenplay artists and others attempted adaptations that were promptly shelved. Directors such as Terry Gilliam (TIDELAND), David Hayter (X-Men) and Darren Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER and THE FOUNTAIN) were at different times slated to take on the film, but eventually backed out. Aronofsky I think was an interesting choice, specifically because I so enjoyed his visual take on The Fountain. But Gilliam deserves quite a bit of credit for saying something that rings truer than most. He said, ""I'd direct the Watchmen if it could be made into a five hour miniseries."" Hmm. Considering the extensive source material, that probably wouldn't be a bad idea. And considering the length of this sucker (163 minutes with an extended version that adds another twenty), one can't help but wonder what Gilliam would've done with it. But, instead, we got Zach Snyder (300) and a theatrical release this year (2009).<br/><br/>Not taking anything away from Snyder, he did pretty well with what he got, which was an overstuffed script filled with some sketchy dialogue. But he also had some great visuals and an amazing musical score that really rocked the film on many different levels. The music came from so many sources that it boggles my mind. Nat King Cole. Bob Dylan. Simon & Garfunkel. Jimi Hendrix. And even KC and the Sunshine Band. All of the songs were well incorporated into the story and gave an added flavor to the scenes.<br/><br/>One also MUST take note of the film's well-deserved R rating. The F-word is liberally sprinkled throughout, as is the act itself. One particularly steamy scene inside an aircraft reveals every inch of two prime characters, and I do mean EVERY INCH. Violence is rampant, just as it should've been, but parents might think  this being a based on a ""comic book""  that it is relatively harmless, Spiderman-like action. Not so. Dismemberment. Superheroes shooting  and killing  pregnant women. Rape. All of these are predominantly in the film's forefront, showing us the deconstruction of the superhero mythos envisioned by the graphic novels' original artist, Alan Moore.<br/><br/>While the films visual qualities, sound, and music are something for fans to cheer about, the terrible dialogue, butt-numbing length, and confusing narration sequences pull the movie down quite a few notches. Initially seeming to be Rorschach's responsibility to narrate what's come before and after (Rorschach is a cop with a face only a psychologist could love and played very well by Jackie Earle Haley, LITTLE CHILDREN), the narration then jumps to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup, THE GOOD SHEPHERD)  whom I've affectionately renamed Mr. Penis  and back, and then back again to Rorschach. Since we're basically viewing the film via Rorschach's journal, I think sticking with him would've been the best and least confusing way to go.<br/><br/>An example of the film's bad dialogue are just too easy to find: ""I know who my father was,"" and ""It doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems,"" and the lowly ""Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon."" Even with these significant flaws, it's worth praising Zach Snyder for having the testes to move forward and make this film. That, in itself, is nothing short of miraculous. But it doesn't negate the obstacles that could've made this a truly great film. Perhaps a trilogy would've been better?"

","Overall good fun to see the pages of the comic book come to 'reel life'. Some sequences and visualizations were absolutely fabulous. Haley played Rorschach perfect, Veidt being played by Mathew Goode seemed a scary proposition but it turned out well. But, all this could have been much better. For starters couldn't Zack Synder invested more in the sound track/ original score section? Music throughout the movie seemed like Zack playing one of his mix tapes from the 70's 80's; the effect totally inappropriate pieces making potentially strong emotional scenes into cheesy and almost laughable segments. This showed a lot of immaturity on the directors part. Like Hendrix's ""All along the watch tower"" playing while Rorschach and Nite Owl approach Karnak.. .""Two riders are approaching. .. and the wind.."" come on, what was he thinking! Apart from Rorschach and the Comedian's roles, all others were forgettable performances. Still being in absolute awe and love of the source material, I enjoyed Zack's work!"

Watchmen took a long time to get to the actual plot, and in the first hour or so, it's kind of all over the place. I'm guessing I'll have to watch it a few times before I can watch it the whole way through and totally understand it. It's very confusing at times, so it's a good idea to read the book/comic first. There's some intense sex scenes and a lot of violence, which I'm guessing makes this an R rated movie. If you're watching this with your parents, I can guarantee that it's going to get really awkward. Amazing movie. Great storyline. Not your basic superhero film, by all means. <br/><br/>GO SEE IT!"

","Watchmen isn't for everyone. During my viewing, a handful of theatergoers walked out during different parts of the film. Watchmen is filled with different kind of scenes and some may be too intense for some viewers. There are several scenes with the Twin Towers in the background. Don't worry, nothing happens to them. They're just part of the scenery, but can bring back some bad memories. The film is filled with social commentary and alternate realities that can be uncomfortable and some violence that may be too much. However, none of these is gratuitous and nowhere close to the violence like movies like Friday the 13th or Saw. It is a serious but entertaining ""superhero"" movie and far above a Spiderman or an X-Men film...even above The Dark Knight."

The newspaper stand guy, the comic reader, most of the normal people really were all left out. Rorschach wasn't a fully realized character; you never felt his loneliness or sadness, only his anger. Silk Specter was not the mean bitter, and strong-willed character she once was, instead she became Silk Follower who did whatever her current boyfriend did pretty much. A lot of the musical choices really killed the mood of the film at times. The violence in this movie is borderline gore. And at times (mostly during fight scenes) the movie feels too finished and over-stylized.<br/><br/>In terms of tone, the unrelenting feeling of dread and uncertainty is not present in the film. Mostly due to the exclusion of the normal characters. The ending was changed to something that works better in film, but that also makes it less open-ended which is something I dislike.<br/><br/>It's faithful enough to appease most fans, and changed enough to appease most movie-goers. But to me he (the director) shined it up so hard that it left an unmistakable glare. The sex, the violence, the music, the changes just didn't do it for me. Those things may have worked in 300, but they felt out-of-place in Watchmen. At times it felt like Watchmen the book (usually during Doc Manhattan's scenes.) and others where it felt just like any other movie.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie, and it's a pretty faithful adaptation. It could have been a lot worse. But some things just held it back. <br/><br/>7.5/10"
"bartireid","9","0","2","7 March 2009"," Superhero Noir
","I may be in a unique situation here, I am a huge Superhero fan, but not a huge fan of reading comics. How is this possible you ask? Well my love for the Superhero is based on Cartoons and video games I indulged in as a kid from the 80's and 90's. So it'll be of no surprise that I write this review with no prior access to Watchmen, but saw the movie with a raw sense of intrigue.<br/><br/>Watchmen was unique for me in the sense that it gave me the chance to reverse roles. Spiderman, Fantastic 4, X-men etc I had no choice but to have expectations going into these films, so I found them frustrating in the sense that the character development was deliberately slowed in order to open the film up to a new audience. Also the story lines in the aforementioned movies were often hacked up for the same purpose. So here comes Watchmen where I had no idea what I could expect so I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.<br/><br/>Watchmen for the best part delivers a dark and noir-ish feel to the superhero genre. It shouldn't be compared to the ""Dark Knight"" I don't feel it fair to either film to pair them together. Christopher Nolan's effort had a responsibility to salvage a franchise that had become disenfranchised.<br/><br/>Zac Snyder's film on the other hand attempts to re-invent the superhero movie concept using Watchmen almost as fresh clay to mould. He does this by focusing on themes murder, sex, and politics which are illustrated by extreme violence , nudity and satirical exhortations. Watchmen emancipates the superhero genre from the turgid stink of teen angst (Spiderman), stupidity (Fantastic Four) and patronising lessons in humility (X-men) that have blighted previous superhero efforts.<br/><br/>The cast is terrifically ensemble, perfect for a story that refuses to single out any character as central. However through no fault of the films direction Jackie Earle Haley dominates as the tough talking, tough walking vigilante Rorschach. And gives the film it's Noir like feel, as he investigates the murder of one of his former colleagues. Following on from Haley is Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl a character manages to combine elements of Batman and Clark Kent, whilst giving Nite Owl an authentic feel of his own. Still as previously mentioned it's a great team effort with Crudup as the Powerful Dr Manhattan, Jeffery Dean Morgan as the wild Comedian, Carla Gugino and Malin Akerman both add a feminine touch as the Mother and Daughter crime fighters. The delightfully plucked Soundtrack add's a depth to the film mixing in some popular music from some of the best in American musical history including Dylan, Hendrix, Simon and Garfunkel to name a few.<br/><br/>Overall Synder delivers a movie rich in cinematic bluster and verve whilst creating a dark atmosphere in a world rife with paranoia and fear. The story ticks over nicely with plenty of educating flash-back sequences which enables the new viewer to get to grips with both plot and characters. The only negative is that you're treated to over 2 hours of a gritty, edgy adult viewing then the last 30 minutes leaves you feeling like you had just watched any other superhero film. Which is a slight let down but not enough to tarnish a very entertaining piece of work.<br/><br/>A must see for superhero fans."
"filmfanatic359","7","0","2","7 March 2009"," A Pleasant Surprise
","I have known about Watchmen since last year, and (ever since i saw the previews) I have been eagerly awaiting its premiere. To get ready for the film, I went out and bought a copy of the graphic novel on which it is based to get ready for when the movie came out. I absolutely fell in love with the book, but I came to another realization: the story is practically unfilmable. Watchmen, the book, is extremely complex, full of sub-plots and flashbacks and newspaper clippings and book excerpts. I just couldn't imagine how they'd pull it off, even with a two and a half hour running time. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Watchmen, the movie, is still quite complex for your typical Hollywood blockbuster, but not so complex that it becomes unwatchable for the average film-goer. This is quite a feat, considering the story revolves around various characters in various different time periods. In my opinion, it'd be very difficult to make a better adaptation than the one Snyder has done. But, having said that, I do have one major complaint. Most of the film is done in the style of films such as 300 or The Spirit, with the slowed-down action sequences. Personally, I don't think this really worked for the film. I would much prefer it to have been done in a gritty, realistic style. This makes some of the action sequences a bit laughable, in parts.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the film still makes the characters hard to love, but even harder to hate. Watchmen follows The Dark Knight in blurring the line between hero and villain. Hopefully more studios will follow these two film's examples and continue to make more thought-provoking, serious superhero movies."

","After watching the watchmen on opening day, I have to say that this movie is good, but it's no ""Dark Knight"" as some fanboy's would have you believe. The first thing that I have to say is please don't take young children who love comics and super heroes to this movie, this is like ""300"" meets a much darker and more explicit version of ""the Dark Knight"", along with a large amount of frontal nudity.<br/><br/>I'll start with the great and gradually move down to the ugly. One of the things that I like the most about this movie is it's amount of respect to the original novel while still giving the story it's own spin. As many of you have probably heard, the ending has been changed, but in the way it has been changed does not hurt the story, but helps it. The new ending makes more sense and also fits in better with the plot. I also believe that the casting was spot on, when you look at these characters from the novel, and then look at them from the movie, you can't really tell the difference. I was amazed that when I looked at these people I saw the Comedian and Silk Spectre instead of actors playing them. I also thought that this movie had beautiful design, direction, and cinematography. When it comes to cinematography, 10/10.<br/><br/>Although Watchmen had great casting for the most part, one character bugged me just a bit, and that was actually Silk Spectre II, or Laura. At times the writing made her dialogue come off as cheap and flat. However, for the most part this did not happen, just in a few scenes. I also thought that Snyder added a little to much gore, which is why this movie reminded me a little to much of 300. Gore was even added in places that it wasn't needed such as in a fight scene that takes place in an alley. I also thought that Snyder added a little to much nudity to this movie, not that it bugged me, but it got kinda annoying and pointless when we got to see a 2 minute long sex scene, I didn't know if I was watching a movie or a porno.<br/><br/>There is really very little that I can say is bad about this movie, beside from some of the makeup being to obvious (Sally Jupiter). To be honest with you the only character that didn't come off as spot on was Nixon, especially with a giant fake nose on his face that made him look like a cartoon character. The only other thing that I can think of that hurt this film was it's lack of central plot. I know that I'm about to get ripped apart by fans and non fans alike, but after reading the graphic novel a few months ago, I could already tell you what this movies downfall would be. What works in a comic book doesn't always work in a movie. I could tell that people in the audience didn't like that the movie would have about 10 different subplots running at the same time, and then suddenly, at the very end we would jump back to the original plot.<br/><br/>So, in my opinion, watchmen was a good film, besides it's lack of clear storyline. Most of the Dialouge and casting was great, loved the drama/action parts. However, this isn't going to be 2009's Dark knight box office record breaker, if we even have one."

","I watched the movie last night and left theater wondering if i would watch this movie again. The beginning of the movie (especially the opening credits), the cemetery scene the killing scene of the comedian and the music choices truly delighted me and made me think the following would be one of the best adaptions of graphic novels in movies after Sin City.<br/><br/>However the movie started disappointing after the first hour, the story (not sure whose fault it was) seemed sort of ridiculous and not very entertaining and captive. The movie seemed to mock itself Then was the whole sequence in the prison, Rorschach psych exam, the attempts of his murder by other convicts and the series of the shots of the bathroom door with flashes of Rorschach advancing to kill were GREAT. But then the movie relapsed in more ridiculous ""emotional"" performances and dragged on for another hour. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is not up to the level of the 300, but some moments were done with great direction daring choices and beautiful photography but the majority of the movie made me think that they didn't have and definite vision of the movie."

"cbrichar","7","0","2","7 March 2009"," A great fan tribute, a few small upsets
","I'll say up front - since it will naturally affect my review - that I'm a huge fan of the graphic novel, and had been eagerly awaiting the movie interpretation for some time.<br/><br/>Oh, and likely some spoilers, minor or otherwise, throughout.<br/><br/>My initial reaction was that it was a wonderful interpretation of a groundbreaking work, made by people who obviously cared very much about the source material, but that it had a few niggling disappointments that contributed to a watering down of the final product.<br/><br/>I found that the tone set in the opening scenes - including the credit sequence - was spot on. You were pulled instantly into the time line (again, something best appreciated by those familiar with the story already) and between the still photos and a surprisingly apt soundtrack, the sadness of the deterioration of the 'glory days' of the Minutemen was palpable. And after that, there were a number of moments where the tone seemed pitch-perfect - due in large part to the incredible care taken to directly transpose entire scenes from the novel directly to the screen - Rosarch's first visit with Dreiberg being a perfect example.<br/><br/>The characters again were transposed to the screen with incredible faithfulness to the source material (for the most part). They managed to somehow keep a veneer of the comic book sheen - see Nixon, for example - while making these people incredibly real. Dreiberg and Rosarch, again, perfect examples of the written characters, both their physicality and personality, jumping straight out of the book. Amazing performances from both of them as well.<br/><br/>And I think, in the end, it's *because* of this fastidious faithfulness that, when something doesn't quite fit, it really jars you. My main point of contention is the casting of Veidt. It was no mistake that the original character had the strong chiseled features and physique of a classic Greek hero, and this was something that simply didn't make it across for me. It's a shame too, as he's such a pivotal character. It's so crucial to get the message across that he had done what he's done out of a *love* of humanity, and that he is calmly, quietly *proud* of his work. But it just didn't fly.<br/><br/>My other 'issues' were fairly minor - a wholly unnecessary sex scene up in Archie (with an especially ill-fitting backing track - at least the Cohen version of it...), a surprisingly high-pitched delivery from Dr. Manhattan which took a bit of time get used to, and a slightly goofy 'cameo' moment from a certain diminutive actor who I was most familiar with from sitcoms. Me, I would've tried to cast him as a short Teller, but what do I know.<br/><br/>So yeah - full points for what they wanted to do, but the deeper message within the original story lost a lot of its impact for little reasons. Too bad, they very nearly got it."
"das417","8","0","3","7 March 2009"," Do the ends justify the means?
","The Watchmen is not just another comic book movie. It is the story of a group of men and women who, for various reasons of their own, decide that they want to make America, and the world, a better place. While most lack superpowers (with the exception of one), these men and women have developed courage, determination, and the strength to face the daily evils that surround us. The moral story behind the Watchmen is not the defeat of some super villain and how the heroes are better off. The real story behind the Watchmen is whether or not the ends justify the means and if heroes can live with the legacies that they create.<br/><br/>The year is 1985. The hero known as the Comedian/Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is dead. Thrown from his condo window, the once famous hero belonged to a former team of vigilantes known as the Watchmen. His death is seen as a robbery gone bad though one who knew him better think otherwise. Rorschach/Walter Kovacs (Jackie Earle Haley), the only member of the Watchmen who still believes in what he is doing, is determined to discover why the Comedian was murdered and who did it. A dark and brooding individual, Rorschach's black and white view of the world and human nature suits him in his personal journey of vengeance and justice.<br/><br/>His task, however, will not be an easy one. The surviving members of the Watchmen have little interest in the fate of the Comedian who they all knew as a violent man who may have finally reaped what he sowed. Nite Owl/Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) has buried his costume and his equipment beneath his apartment, Ozymandias/Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) is busy as CEO of his own corporation with plans of creating a new source of energy, while Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) is busy trying to save her relationship to Dr. Manhattan/Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) who has the ability to exist outside of time and space.<br/><br/>The Watchmen, as noted above, isn't a normal comic book about heroes saving the day. The movie focuses not only on the present mystery of the Comedian's fate but also the history of how the Watchmen came to be who they are. These are men and women who discovered that their place in society was no longer wanted due to politics and social anger over their actions. The sense of bitterness in all of them, with the exception of Dr. Manhattan, is felt as a betrayal. Why work so hard to defend the people when the people have turned on them? What about their lives? What about their sacrifice? Why be a hero when it only takes your own life away? <br/><br/>Rorschach discovers that the conspiracy behind the Comedian's death is traced back to one of their own. Adrian knew that the Comedian, as well as the reset of the Watchmen, stood in his way to bring real world peace. However, in order to do so, it means the death of millions and the framing of Dr. Manhattan. Rising American and Soviet tensions makes Adrian believe that now is the time for a united world even if it means sacrificing the Watchmen, and millions, to do so. In a normal comic book story, this would seem straight forward but this is not a normal comic book plot.<br/><br/>In fact, Adrian gets away with his plan and millions do die. Dr. Manhattan leaves the Earth once more in exile so that the world can believe that he was responsible and thus prevent a nuclear war while Nit Owl and the Silk Specter realize that Adrian cannot be stopped. Rorschach is the only one who chooses to make a stand and declare that Adrian is a murderer even if he saved billions from nuclear war. The tragedy is then that Rorschach must die so that the lie can remain a secret. Adrian may be a murderer, but he actions did prevent a nuclear war and the deaths of millions more.<br/><br/>Thus this is the question the Watchmen asks in the end. Do the ends justify the means? Hero or not, we all face the question. The moral story behind the Watchmen is that these were men and women who choose to live a life of great sacrifice only to discover that the sacrifice wasn't always worth it. They couldn't save everyone and they couldn't even save themselves. Adrian brought world peace but at the cost of any morality he once believed in and Rorschach lost his life trying to live what he believed. The question of who watches the Watchmen is then answered.<br/><br/>They watch themselves..... And don't always like what they see.<br/><br/>The movie follows closely to the comic book in almost every way despite the exclusions of some character back stories, side plots, and a change of the details leading to the conclusion. In the end, though, the Watchmen is one of the most faithful movies to follow source material, and is a foundation for comic books movies that will come after it. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Fantastic movie, overall. Here's the flaws: 1.) The movie is excessively violent, to the point where it begins to distort the characters somewhat. Nite Owl, Ozymandias, and Silk Spectre II are WAY too brutal during their combat scenes. 2.) Too much excess and fluff. Critical elements were removed from the screenplay, which allowed for Snyder to keep unnecessary scenes. 3.) The title scene is poorly done. 4.) Not long enough. This should be 3.5 hours+ long. 5.) The ending is crap. It completely destroys some of the characterizations.<br/><br/>Here's what Snyder does exceptionally well 1.) The music is unbelievable (the soundtrack choices) 2.) Rorschach and the Comedian were played impeccably 3.) Special effects were very good. 4.) RICHARD NIXON! HARROOOHHHH!"

","Having read the graphic novel first, I have a very short, non-spoilery review.<br/><br/>-Loved most of the casting choices, with a possible exception of Veidt, about whom I have no serious complaint.<br/><br/>-Overall I thought the inclusion of superfluous source material was good, but could have included more, axed some of the existing possibly. The story about Ride of the Valkyries from Hollis' autobiography excerpt would have been nice, and I especially would have liked to see the rest of the interview with Veidt.<br/><br/>-The worst part of this film for me, and why I knocked it down to a 7 rather than an 8, is the music. One or two campy music scenes I can handle. But anytime this film can't think of a way to show characters doing something it falls on some clichÃ© kitch music to get a slight chuckle out of the audience, see uses of All Along the Watchtower and Hallelujah for the most ridiculous.<br/><br/>That said, good movie, wish it had taken more of it's scenes seriously."

"cgatewoo","10","0","3","6 March 2009"," On the fence
","I saw this at the midnight showing launch party. My roommate and I went into the film with no prior knowledge of the series. So this will be a review for the everyman. I honestly can't condemn or support seeing this movie.<br/><br/>First reactions were good. I believe it was the impact of the ending that left me happy, but that's a later paragraph. The level of maturity of the film definitely stood out. It is rated R, and it wants the audience to know it. The level of blood and nudity is beyond anything else I have seen. Although I must address the fact that Zack Snyder has a habit of making his male leads stand naked looking at stuff.<br/><br/>The film definitely bleeds graphic novel. Each scene does not feel like a scene. Instead it appropriately is built around images. This film may actually be loyal to a fault. It starts on a high note. The opening scene is bombastically exciting. It saddens that the level of action dips for quite a while. With the evident dip in action Snyder must rely on his storytelling skill (which 300 proved isn't his main suit).<br/><br/>This might actually be out of his hands. Story sections rely more heavily on the source material than directorial stamina, this isn't a bad thing). The stories are adequately good. This all seems good because it goes places the genre doesn't. The portraits of these characters are more than any Superman movie could dream of. Unfortunately this poses a problem. The whole comic book thing comes back. While it didn't bother me specifically, the flashback scenes really took a number on the pacing. At over two and a half hours, this movie feels directed straight at the fans. I fear that while compelling, these scenes will throw off the general audiences.<br/><br/>All that being said, I liked the film. Rorschach is now second on my list for coolest comic book characters. Nobody will ever top Deadpool. I just don't think the main audience will get it. I walked out completely satisfied. I do not need anything else about the Watchmen. All the loose ends were tied up completely. I will curse any news of a sequel. This film has been made and is now done. Few films reach the level of catharsis this did.<br/><br/>While not without its faults, this film did what it set out to do: create a true and uncompromising view of what the Watchmen meant. To all those who disagree, I read the forums. A giant squid would not make any sense to me, the layman. A few final notes. The costumes look hokey; that's because they are supposed to. These aren't stereotypical superheroes. Thus they didn't put way too much effort into perfecting costuming. The soundtrack is amazing. One issue; the use of the song Hallelujah, during a sex scene is only appropriate in an American Pie type movie.<br/><br/>See it if you are intrigued, just don't use it as a date movie."
"aoc777","8","0","3","6 March 2009"," Who Watches the Watchmen - We Did!
","Five friends went to watch the Watchmen - a fan of the original graphic novel from the 80s, 2 recent converts and 2 people, who had never read Alan Moore's work. Let's look at the component score:<br/><br/>The Story<br/><br/>The writing and adaptation to the screen is excellent. The story is intriguing. One of our group was slightly puzzled in between because of the many lines of story to follow, but it all came together nicely in the end. We discussed at length whether the movie should have focused on one aspect rather than following pretty much all the different lines laid out in the original work by Alan Moore, but this would have led to a loss of complexity and made the movie shallow. So what viewers will be embarking on is a mix of SF, drama, love story, mystery and superhero story, which has something to offer for many people.<br/><br/>Cinematography<br/><br/>Absolutely stunning. The images were strong and beautiful, the camera work outstanding. The feeling of the 80s was conveyed in excellent detail. Those of us remembering them well, were impressed, deeply.<br/><br/>The Action<br/><br/>Here is were the first controversy sets in. While a superhero movie should show its heroes in a larger than life position, one thing that always attracted the readers to Watchmen was that the heroes remained believable and were not too superhuman. This moderation has gone out the window for the movie and the three of our group familiar with the graphic novel felt the action in the movie was over the top.<br/><br/>The Violence<br/><br/>For a movie with an R16 (New Zealand) rating, this movie was very graphic. Not wanting to give anything away, two of our group had to look away in certain scenes and two more found it too much. One out of five didn't mind. The biggest argument against the level of violence shown is that it does not contribute to the story. A lot of it could have been handled a bit more elegantly off-screen, without taking any impact away. We all (even the person who did not mind) would give this movie a strict R18 rating. <br/><br/>The CGI and Tricks<br/><br/>Mostly good, everyone could at least name one glitch and some of the movements looked too artificial. We all thought we had seen better in a few scenes. These were minor and overall the movie is a stunning achievement.<br/><br/>The Music and Sound<br/><br/>Nice 80s score with very memorable hits. One of us though that one of the songs was giving the story away at the time, but that was because he knew the story. Just one issue everyone commented on: The movie is too LOUD. Here and there a quieter moment would have been good. <br/><br/>Overall<br/><br/>We were left a bit shell-shocked - assaulted by images and sound, but we were thoroughly entertained. The running time was long but the complex story needed it to unfold. I would not recommend this movie to anyone put off by graphic violence. There are a few sex scenes too, but these are more funny than offensive and no one minded. The movie appears to be aimed at the 15 to 25 year old male bracket, so a few of us felt left out a bit. We are still not sure, if we are going to recommend the movie to our friends - well to some we will, others we are going to warn off.<br/><br/>If you go, you are in for a hell of a ride, enjoy!"
"supernma","10","0","5","6 March 2009"," Watchmen is Extraordinary
","After decades of waisted time developing perhaps the most difficult book-to-film project in recent pop culture memory, fans and moviegoers finally get the Watchmen they deserve.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's award winning graphic novel is the most faithful comic book adaptation anyone could have hoped for, coming from Hollywood. It's not even three hours long, and yet it manages to capture both the tone and themes of the source material, going as far as to totally replicate some of the sets, costumes, and angles, mostly including dialogue taken directly from the book. The score is a large part of the film, reminiscent of 'Blade Runner' and other 80's sci-fi cult classics. It also includes many songs from period-specific icons, which adds yet another layer to each scene. The action is astonishingly brutal; the viewer feeling every punch and cringing with every broken bone, severed limb, and exploding body. The film's violence may turn some viewers off, but it certainly worked for me. Contrary to popular belief, Snyder uses the slow motion effect quite sparingly, and when it is employed, it is to add tension and drama to a movement or moment that would otherwise pass by unnoticed.<br/><br/>The casting is superb. Jackie Earl Haley is Rorschach, Patrick Wilson is Nite Owl (II), Billy Crudup embodies Dr. Manahttan, Matthew Goode brings an arrogance to Ozymandias, and Malin Akerman (while notably the weaker of the ensemble) never fails to nail the moments of raw emotion and humor. Of course, while Jackie Earl Haley is perfect as Rorschach, my favorite character, and the one I most relate to, is Patrick Wilson's Dan Dreiberg/Night Owl II. I would even go as far to say that he improves upon the character in the graphic novel, adding to a layer of sympathy already laid out by Alan Moore.<br/><br/>Yes, there is still a lot left out, but these are minor details that do not directly effect the plot or character arcs. It is evident that Snyder tried his best to include at least a little of everything from the graphic novel, and fans can even look forward to an extensively expanded director's cut later this year. As for myself, I'll being seeing a second time in Imax very soon."
"tharrington-3","9","0","2","6 March 2009"," For Those Who Have Read The Graphic Novel
","Brilliant. A beautiful film occasionally interjected with shots of brutal violence. Zach Snyder used his 120 million dollars brilliantly to bring to life one of the most varied comic books of all time: from Dr. Manhattan's Martian palace to the street corner of New York. The film retains a great deal from the comic book down to direct visual homologues, yet at the same time cuts so much.<br/><br/>SPOILER-DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE CUTS FROM THE STORYLINE!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a great deal of the political conflict drops by the wayside along with the Tale of the Black Freighter. However, Snyder promises an extended director's version that will add back in most of the scenes with the comic book within the comic book as well as other tidbits. However, the additions such as the beautiful soundtrack,(the sound of silence, the times they are achangin', and all along the watchtower, to name a few) are all good. The new ending is possibly even better than the ending in the comic book. Sacrilege, I know.<br/><br/>The Actors: Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a good job as the Comedian. He manages to convey the inner nihilism and satiric twists of the Comedian very well. 9/10.<br/><br/>Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan. Great job conveying subtle, yet powerful emotion along with the pure logic of the character. Only one issue...he needs to wear pants much more often. There is way too much blue penis. 9.5/10<br/><br/>Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II. Good job. She conveys the inner turmoil of the character well. 8.5/10<br/><br/>Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt. Very well done. He is perfectly in his element as the effeminate yet menacing Ozymandias. Look for the folder labeled boys on his desktop. 9.5/10<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg. Perfect. He is both the boy scout hero, the nerdy intellectual, and the lacking in self-confidence lover. Amazing. 10/10<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. A brilliant performance. His last scene is unbelievable. This is Oscar-worthy, I kid you not. His lines are even better when he says them. His narration is beautifully rough, but when the mask comes off-he blows you out of the water. 11/10<br/><br/>It is amazing. Go watch the watchmen. NOW!"
"KrakatoaEnt317","9","0","2","6 March 2009"," Very impressed with this film....
","First off I've never read the graphic novel so I had no expectations besides seeing the trailer. Zack Snyder already impressed me with the Dawn of the Dead remake & 300. He did not disappoint one bit, This is the most extreme hard hitting comic book ever made. I can't believe this film got an R for all the stuff that was in this movie. Violence & gore galore, pregnant woman getting killed, basically a scene straight from a porn, plenty of blue body parts, & other stuff.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley (Bad News Bears, Losin' It, Dollman, Nemesis, Maniac Cop 3, Little Children, All the King's Men, & Semi-Pro) gave the performance of a lifetime as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach. I've always thought he was a good actor especially after seeing All the King's Men & Little Children but never thought he could pull off such a cool role as Rorschach. He's a small guy & he never seemed like someone that would seem threatening but he really outdid himself on this film. I must say his performance rivals Heath Ledger in last year's Dark Knight. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Burning Zone, Dead & Breakfast, P.S. I Love You, Supernatural, & Grey's Anatomy) looks like Javier Bardem's twin brother, it's really crazy how much they are alike. I've never really seen anything else from this guy but he was very impressive as Edward Blake / The Comedian in his supporting role. He was my second favorite character after Rorschach, He was insane & killed with no problem, I loved it.<br/><br/>I'm surprised no one else is talking about (Angels in America, The Alamo, The Phantom of the Opera, Hard Candy, Little Children, Running with Scissors, & Lakeview Terrace) Patrick Wilson's performance, He was very good in this. It's good to see him getting more lead roles these days. I respect this guy, he's not afraid to take a risk. Stuff like Little Children, Hard Candy, & Angels in America are all very interesting roles/projects to do. Billy Crudup (Sleepers, Almost Famous, Big Fish, The Good Shepherd, Mission: Impossible III, Monument Ave. & Waking the Dead) was good in this but I expected better from him considering his past work. Plus he was way too exposed in this, every time he was on screen I wanted to scream out ""PUT ON SOME PANTS"". They showed way too much of his self in this, I don't care if it was pink, blue, or whatever it was too much really. I would have rather seen more of Malin Akerman nude in this. Regardless, he still had a good performance in this but I've seen better performances from him in other films. Stephen McHattie (XIII, Shoot 'Em Up, 300, The Fountain, Beverly Hills Cop III, & Seinfeld), Carla Gugino (Son in Law, Jaded, Snake Eyes, Spin City, Chicago Hope, Karen Sisco, Sin City, & Righteous Kill), & Matt Frewer (Max Headroom, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Doctor Doctor, The Stand, National Lampoon's Senior Trip, Lawnmower Man 2, PSI Factor, House of Mouse, Dawn of the Dead, Desperation, & Riding the Bullet) were really good in their small roles.<br/><br/>Now on to the weakest links.... Matthew Goode (Chasing Liberty, Match Point, Imagine Me & You, Copying Beethoven, & The Lookout) was excellent in The Lookout & had a better performance in Woody Allen's Match Point but in this he was a little above average but nothing special compared to the others. I hate to say this but Malin Akerman (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, The Comeback, Brothers Solomon, Heartbreak Kid, & 27 Dresses) is a horrible actress for the most part but this was her best performance so far but that's not really saying much. I will give her this, she looked really sexy in this movie & her nude scenes were more impressive than the one in The Heartbreak Kid. I don't understand why she was casted tho, maybe the actresses that Zack Snyder wanted didn't want to get nude or do that borderline porn love scene. Look at his past leading ladies Sarah Polley & Lena Headey, both have a lot more talent and I consider them both more attractive than Malin Akerman. I will say some of song choices in the film were interesting but most of them fit. Not sure how much I liked the ending, I will have to think about this. If you have almost 3 hours to kill, this is worth checking out on the big screen with it's great visual & special effects."

I really have no criticism to give the movie except that they should have marketed it better. Many parents brought their young kids to see it because they thought it was going to be like The Dark Knight or Iron Man. Instead, you see tons of violence and gore. I don't think any of them expected that because during all of the previews, it showed the action portion of it. And, of course, everybody loves action, even young kids. Now, you gotta admit, this movie is packed with action. All throughout the movie, it kept me on the edge of my seat and constantly biting my nails (which I never do unless I'm watching a suspenseful movie.) Once I got home, thought about the movie, and researched it a little bit, I realized that it was really amazing and I'm glad I saw it. You have to look at it and think about it to see it's true beauty:)"

","I'm so used to my favorite books being destroyed as movies, so my expectations were pretty low. Obviously, no movie can ever top it's original book, especially such a psychologically complex book like Watchmen. As I sat down to watch the midnight premier, I braced myself. I was so surprised! The movie stays very faithful to the novel (even keeping in some of my favorite quotes), which is a huge plus for me. The actors brought all the characters (especially Rorschach, my favorite) to life just how I pictured them. Well, I didn't really care for Laurie. Besides her, the acting was dead on. The special effects were brilliant. And I'll say this as someone who usually falls asleep during action movies... the action was intense. I actually WATCHED it (something rare for me). I do wish they had cut back on the fight scenes just a little to focus more on the characters, but I'll forgive it since it IS a movie. The graphic sex scene was torturous, probably my biggest complaint of the movie. The ending was altered, but it was so slight that I don't feel it really mattered. Yes, the psychological complexity of the story and the character development was often overlooked (but not as much as I had feared). Let's face it, if people whine at a nearly 3-hour movie (please, is it so hard to sit still for that long?) then no way could the movie be all that the book was. As someone who almost never likes movies-from-books, I think it could hardly have been better. Except maybe more of Rorschach :]"
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","0","4","6 March 2009"," While I believe its heart is in the right place, ""Watchmen"", while not terrible, is a disappointment
","""They should have played BTO's 'Gimme Your Money Please' instead of Dylan's 'The Times They Are a-Changin' over the opening credits"".<br/><br/>That was my girlfriend's take on ""Watchmen"". While it got a laugh out of the few people who overheard the sentiment, I strongly disagree with her. ""Watchmen"" doesn't feel like a cash-grab. I honestly think it doesn't. What it does feel like is a loving, 'I'll do it right so nobody else messes it up' adaptation. I don't doubt that Zack Snyder has as much love for the source material as I do, and I truly do appreciate what he was trying to do with this film.<br/><br/>I'm glad I went in with low expectations due to some of the early reviews, because Snyder's approach, while perhaps seeming to him the only logical approach, to truly film the comic book, is not a cinematic approach. Seen in IMAX, this weakness becomes even clearer. Snyder's storyboards were so close to Dave Gibbons' art that half the movie is shot in stifling close-ups, failing to make even basic use of the widescreen format. Comics and film are not the same medium, and the problems inherent in Snyder's ""Watchmen"" are the same which would be inherent in my taking the comics, copying Moore's script, and adding the most basic descriptions necessary to turn a script into prose, plus a random ultra-stylized sentence every twenty pages.<br/><br/>All that said, ""Watchmen"" is not really unwatchable or terrible, except for the direction. The set design is impressive, the look of the ""Watchmen"" world is right, and while the scenes with Nixon are embarrassing, and Malin Akerman really botches some line readings, the performances are generally excellent. Jackie Earle Haley is completely convincing as Rorschach, and I found him to be the perfect embodiment of Rorschach in every way. I look forward to his take on the scenes which will be added in the director's cut, which I will see at some point. Patrick Wilson's absolutely NAILS awkward nerdy Dan, although he's less convincing as Nite Owl. Similarly, I have no complaints regarding Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and certainly not Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, whose visit to Moloch was the only thing I felt the film did better than the comics. The soundtrack would make for a good CD, but some of it is utterly nonsensical and bizarre, and I'm surprised that the scene which has attracted most of the negative attention in this regard is Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" playing over Dan and Laurie's sex scene. At least the song fits with the content of the scene, and the psychology at play, as opposed to most of the other uses of songs in the film. <br/><br/>Also, since much of the screenplay is taken directly from the comics, ""Watchmen"" isn't a badly-written film, although some of the additions made to the dialogue are absolutely horrendous on every level, and it is a little structurally messy (again, the idea that you can film a comic is totally nonsensical and not cinematic in the slightest, and this extends to the writing as well). Still, looking at Sam Hamm's script, which might have been made at one point, one can't help but be grateful that the masses have been exposed to some of the quality of the comics, and to these characters, although there is not enough room for proper characterization in this cut of the film, and some of that was sacrificed. Perhaps the film is a lesser achievement than that first trailer which kept copies of ""Watchmen"" flying off the shelves for months before the release of this film, and exposed so many new readers to the excellence of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' work. <br/><br/>Perhaps the ultimate irony is that the ""Watchmen Motion Comics"" DVD which is now available, and endorsed by WB, is almost as cinematic as this film. Snyder films the comics, has actors say the lines, and adds slow motion here and there, and some truly atrocious and ill-advised scenes of violence. ""Watchmen Motion Comics"" is six hours long, but is the entire comic, including ""Tales of the Black Freighter"", slightly animated. Lips move, the wind blows, stuff like that. It would be considered quite bad if released to theaters as an animated adaptation of ""Watchmen"" but the real tragedy here is that this film is the live action equivalent of the motion comics, and if you want to watch ""Watchmen"" instead of reading it, that would be the better approach because everything is covered, and because, absurdly enough, it's got a better musical score! ""Watchmen"" is not absolutely atrocious, and certainly not as bad as ""The Spirit"" or a couple of other recent comic book adaptations, thanks mostly to the enjoyable story and the excellent performances, but it is hugely disappointing, largely due to the ineptitude of the simplistic direction, as well as the pointless additions, which clash with the tone of the film. The opening credit sequence is quite fun, though. It's worth seeing once, twice for the extended edition, but that's about it."
"NailToTheX","10","0","5","6 March 2009"," wow... just wow...
","just finished watching the watchmen a few hours ago at an imax theater. as a forward, i am not familiar with the graphic novels... at the moment anyways.<br/><br/>This is the best film i've ever seen. There isn't a single thing about the movie that I would have changed. I am usually extremely critical of every movie, and just about every movie that i've ever watched there is something that I would have changed from the godfather, to lord of the rings, to shawshank, to the matrix, to cuckoo's nest, to pulp fiction, to slumdog, to 300. That is a hell of a league of movies. The weakest actor might have been the Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias character... that speaks volumes that all the character parts are superb.<br/><br/>story, cinematography, score, effects, violence... all brilliant Like i said, i haven't read the graphic novels, but in all fairness, when is a movie better than the corresponding book? Comparing it and judging it based on a different format is not a fair comparison. Compare it to any other movie, or even a comic hero type movie. the closest movies i can think of in a similar genre is batman begins which is i would say an 8 or 8.5, and the dark knight about 7 or 7.5 (although i haven't seen iron man)... this movie is a 10 until something better comes out."
"neil-476","9","0","5","6 March 2009"," Very faithful to the original
","I have loved the comic series since I first read it nearly 20 years ago in book form. I have been looking forward to this film since I saw how faithfully the first trailer reproduced some of the iconic images from the book.<br/><br/>Was I disappointed? No, I wasn't. I really, really enjoyed the movie. It wasn't perfect - if I had to gripe, it would be with Matthew Goode who, to my eyes, never really captured the golden boy self-assurance I had always associated with Adrian Veidt - I had expected a gold and purple colour palette to be used for Ozymandias, and greys and silvers didn't quite fit. There was, perhaps, a little over-reliance on slow motion, and I didn't always feel that the music selections fitted. On the plus side, the action sequences were fine if a little violent, Jackie Early Haley was outstanding as Rorschach, the Dr Manhattan effects were perfect, and Malin Akerman was totally hot as Silk Spectre.<br/><br/>Taking a step back, though, I'm part of the group that would be expected to enjoy this movie - fanboys who are already in love with the source material. And if I'm objective, I think I probably enjoyed the opening sequence best because it showed me something I didn't expect to see. And how will the movie appeal to those who aren't familiar with the source? People I was with said that they enjoyed it, they think, but it was really long and rather involved. Which, I suspect is fair comment.<br/><br/>But for an ageing fanboy, it was pretty good."
"gpaltrow2001","8","0","5","6 March 2009"," Yes, it CAN be enjoyed by fans AND non-fans-- excellent!
","I saw a midnight showing last night. Mostly males in their early 20's, but about 10% gals, too. I was a fan of the graphic novel when it first came out to show you how old I am. Two questions arise: Does it hold up well against the graphic novel, and is it a good movie? Well, you will never be able to live up to the graphic novel, I'm afraid. It is truly apples and oranges. But I happen to like BOTH apples and oranges. So I can separate the two as an original fan and a movie fan. There are details, nuances, and depth that the movie could never get into. If you like graphic novels, or really good books in general, you should go out and buy Watchmen and enjoy it. I'm going to re-read it. But No, due to the details, it doesn't hold up.<br/><br/>Now, how about just as a movie? It is truly an amazing achievement. It is eye-popping, it soars, it has characters you care about, and best of all, it's LONG. In a good way. The length allows you to really get into the story and characters, in much the same way the long movie 'Dark Knight' did. In fact, if you liked Dark Knight for its story, you'll definitely love Watchmen.<br/><br/>There will be some fanboys who will NEVER love this movie, just like its creator, Alan Moore, doesn't. Too bad for both. They are close-minded.<br/><br/>Superman has been re-told over and over in various forms and story lines. It hasn't hurt the overall mythology, has it? Enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime mythology. There will be no sequels or re-makes. And enjoy it on the big screen with someone who loves big blockbuster movies that are NOT Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8 instead of a 10 because while you DO care about the characters, you simply can't care about them deeply enough, ala Slumdog Millionaire. So instead of leaving the theater with leftover roller-coaster, powerful emotions like Slumdog, you leave happy after having watched the type of big film that Hollywood, and not Bollywood, can make."
"myles-wallace","7","0","1","6 March 2009"," True to its origins
","I don't think that Watchmen creator Alan Moore could find much to complain about in this rendition of his best-selling graphic novel. Neither will it disappoint moviegoers. It's packed with enough action, romance, and conspiracy to make sure of that.<br/><br/>Throughout the first half of the movie, it seems almost a frame-for-frame copy of the graphic novel that started it all (except for the pirate sub-plot, which will be available as a separate animated movie). While this is sure to please the purists, I found the inclusion and precise plotting of the film to be sometimes tedious and sometimes smacking of artistic cowardice. Movies need to respect the original books from which their inspired, but they also need to introduce something new--and that shouldn't just be graphics and special effects.<br/><br/>I guess I left the theater dissatisfied because I wanted a little more. I wanted the movie to answer some long-nagging questions, such as how does Rorsarch's mask work? I also wanted it to add narrative flashbacks to the characters instead of relying so heavily on character conversation. After all, aren't movies supposed to show and not tell?"
