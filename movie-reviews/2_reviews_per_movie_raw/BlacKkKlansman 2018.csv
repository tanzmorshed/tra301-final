"normando40","8","294","410","8 January 2019"," Totally Recognizable Villany
","A terrific Spike Lee film with humor and gut wrenching truths. My first reaction was that the villains were too one dimensional, caricaturesque. It was impossible to stay with them for more than a few seconds - even that outrageous scene of connubial bliss where she expresses her willingness, in the most romantic terms, to kill Blacks. I recoiled in horror and kind of laughing nervously - what is this, a satire? And then, I realized - the real life villanis are one dimensional, they are caricaturesque, they are their own satire. John David Washinton is great and sounds just like his father. Adam Driver brings a presence that is nothing short of compelling, The final real life images are devastating, I highly recommend it."

","Amazing true story of a small team of police infiltrating a local klan chapter to try to stop looming violence.<br/><br/>Driver is first class as the white undercover presence, with Washington himself oozing presence throughout as the black officer who conceives the plan, runs the show and in a number of hilarious high points gains the respect and trust of the big Klan chief over the phone.<br/><br/>Whilst there is arguably room for a little bit of trimming, this remains highly engaging throughout with a great script and fine performances. The amazing trick here is how Lee seems to very cleverly shift from laugh out loud comedy to troubling sometimes fairly intense scene and back without missing a beat."

"TxMike","Null","140","212","16 November 2018"," Based on real events in 1970s Colorado, a black police officer joins the KKK.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Although it runs a bit long at just over 2 hours it is such an interesting story, well-told, that it never seemed too long.<br/><br/>The whole story is based on the 2014 book by Ron Stallworth, of his experiences in the 1970s in Colorado Springs as a fresh police officer, and the first black man to that position in that city. The character is very well played by John David Washington. In real life Stallworth had been an achiever in high school and wanted to make a difference as a police officer.<br/><br/>On a whim he notices an ad which was recruiting members for a new KKK chapter in the Colorado Springs area. Having a phone voice and speaking manner not easily identified as black he successfully applied for membership, and at one point even speaking directly to David Duke in New Orleans.<br/><br/>Ron would not have gotten very far in his ruse without a white man to replace him in live encounters, for this he recruited the help of fellow police officer,
Adam Driver as Flip Zimmerman who happened to be Jewish, another ethnic target of the KKK. Together they thwarted some serious KKK mischief planned.<br/><br/>For a very serious subject the movie director Spike Lee injects a fair share of humor, all very appropriate. Near the end the events of the 1970s are intercut with modern events and protests, showing that white supremacy activities are far from over."
"tkmcc-08780","6","391","635","20 August 2018"," Incredible true story comes with a lot of fictional baggage
","There's much good about this movie, starting with Ron Stallworth's incredible deception of the Klu Klux Klan. Racism in all its ugliness is powerfully shown. There's a lot of humor at the expense of some really dumb people. 
Unfortunately, there's a lot wrong with the movie too. Most of this is because the director embellished the true story. I'm not a big fan of directors tinkering with what really happened in order to add their own touch, and then still claim ""based on a true story"".
The result of the tinkering is a very uneven movie, particularly in the apparently ""easy"" parts of infiltrating the KKK and the ""hard"" parts where things go wrong. The ""easy"" parts are, remarkably, mostly the true story. Apparently this wasn't dramatic enough, so a lot of fictional ""hard"" parts were added to build tension including whole characters and situations. That's bad enough, but the added parts often made no sense, such as having no real origin (like one character's intense suspicions) and no resolution to the dilemma presented - they just seem to go away, are forgotten or have no effect on the inevitable story arc. Many seem to have been thrown in only to make already duped people look even more ridiculous. 
The characters themselves are, with a few exceptions, just caricatures. It's not hard to figure out what's next since they do exactly what you expect.
Eventually the movie just got boring since it all moved to an inevitable and very easy to see end. Ultimately, the movie is maybe an hour of an amazing true and humorous story marred by over an hour of superfluous and poorly executed fiction."
"EnoVarma","8","397","651","31 July 2018"," One hell of a movie
","Spike Lee has created an almost unimaginably uneven career in films, but it has never been in doubt, that he is one of the most talented American filmmakers of his generation. And should you have forgotten that, now you can remind yourself by watching the amazing ""BlacKkKlansman"", which won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May.<br/><br/>""BlacKkKlansman"" tells the true story of a rookie African American police officer who in the 70's infiltrated in the KKK, but that's certainly not what the movie is about. Lee tackles head-on the contemporary hot topics of racism, the police killing black Americans, and white supremacy to create an overwhelming pamphlet about the American identity - which has been hurled into a state of great confusion after the last presidential election.<br/><br/>Movies don't come much more political as this one. In a way, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a companion piece to ""The Post"" - a movie that similarly discussed the current political climate in a 70's setting - but with loads more of blackness, humour, anger and attitude. It's a better movie, too.<br/><br/>Though not perfect. Form-wise, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is sometimes paced oddly and feels needlessly long: not overlong, exactly, because you're not going to be bored for a minute. Visually it could have used a little more of the delicious textures typical of those 70's blacksploitations it makes references to.<br/><br/>But Lee is such a virile storyteller, that you can't help but get sucked in it all. And he has SO much to say. ""BlacKkKlansman"" is at its savage best when putting in perspective the official holier-than-thou image of the white Americans: Harry Belafonte cameos as an eye-witness of the beastly lynching of Jesse Washington in 1916.<br/><br/>Actors in ""BlacKkKlansman"" are great. John David Washington excels in the lead role. Adam Driver signs what is arguably his best role to date. Ryan Eggold is terrific as the local boss of the KKK, and the Finnish Jasper Pääkkönen impresses as his right hand man. The biggest surprise of all is Topher Grace, who is near-ingenious as David Duke, a well-mannered bag of sleaze in a three-piece.<br/><br/>""BlacKkKlansman"" is an incredibly rich and stirring piece of contemporary cinema with enough stuff to fuel a conversation for hours. Or days. You can get a lot less with a price of a movie ticket these days."
"tallard","5","438","744","12 September 2018"," Terribly dissappointed at film and annoyed at marketing
","I've generally liked Spike Lee films over the years. I had high expectations or this one, given the awards. 
Many negative reviews have already covered issues of pacing and writing and editing, which I generally agree with. As a person who's been an anti-racism activist my entire life, I felt this film was heavy handed and propagandist. If a woke person can feel this is heavy handed, imagine how those not on board with the topic can be totally feel propagandised, how futile is it in regards to effectiveness at creating social change?
On the point of marketing, speaking points, and the ridiculous opening line about being based on a true story. So many reviews here state their amazement and how impressed they are at a Jewish person and a black person working together like this. This is a lie, there is no Jewish partner in the book, it is completely fictionalised. Furthermore, confounding race issues with religious issues is truly a non starter. 
But most of the film is fictionalised. The majority of the book is about his undercover work AGAINST black activists, which he spent over three years on.
Given the actual facts as laid out in the book, this film really goes down in ratings. The false marketing is the saddest statement about our society. When people are more interested in virtue-signalling than the truth. 
Had the production values been better, at least it might have been enjoyable as a stand alone, without the pretence of being based on the book, but I kept falling asleep, idiot conversations droned on endlessly and completely took me out of the film. So it's a fail both on production values and TRUTH.
The high rating says a lot about how important virtue-signalling has become in our society."
"BlurayAddictAU","9","315","554","8 August 2018"," BlacKkKlansman is somehow funny & utterly brutal at the same time, phenomenal.
","I'd love to thank the Adelaide Film Festival Film Club for the free advance screening for this review.<br/><br/>Blackkklansman comes to us from Director Spike Lee & Producer Jordan Peele and tells the true story of Ron Stallworth, the first african-american police officer in Colorado Springs infiltrating the Klu Klux Klan.<br/><br/>To achieve this he enlists the help of a fellow officer played by Adam Driver to pose as him in person while Ron handled the phone calls and planning. <br/><br/>This film is biographical in nature but has some fantastic storytelling, looking at the trailers, it looked like a really fun time with some funny humour about the time period and racism.
I'm glad to report this isn't just some comedy movie, here we have a rare film that manages to be funny and outlandish at times but at the same time drives home a serious emotional message, Spike Lee should absolutely be commended for this because it was executed flawlessly. <br/><br/>John David Washington gives an interesting quirky performance here and nails it perfectly, Adam Driver turned out to be much more involved in the story than I had anticipated and has some really great moments.<br/><br/>I have never had a cinema experience quite like this, for instance at the tail end of the film, in the space of 10 minutes the entire audience in my screening went from laughing and some perfectly executed comedic dialogue to utter still silence in absolute awe, frozen & horrified by what was appearing on screen, this silence went on for a few moment even after the fade to black and an applause started up. <br/><br/>This film had me thinking about what I had seen for a long, long time afterward and I am still thinking about it almost every second.<br/><br/>Blackkklansman really shows the Klan for what they really are, and highlights the good work of an amazing african-american police officer. The supporting cast does a great job here, Topher Grace as David Duke was an insanely good performance and I can imagine how hard it would be to embody that particular character and Laura Harrier plays off of Washington beautifully.<br/><br/>In addition there is a great cameo at the beginning of this film, be on the look out!<br/><br/>Blackkklansman is easily in my top 10 for 2018 so far and I urge you all to go see it in cinemas, small warning though, there are some quite confronting images in this film, they are hard to watch but I think that it should be watched as that is the intention here.
Blackkklansman is out in cinemas August 17th."
"burenmaurice","3","424","760","18 August 2018"," So, so disappointing
","First off I'll say that seeing Jordan Peele's name on the credits and the trailer set my standards really high. And for the first half or so the film genuinely did seem interesting. <br/><br/>There's no real conflicting values going on. As soon as Ron's love interest starts to question him, he just gives his view and they walk off. And then after the explosion, they're happy again. What. At the initial rally with the black activist it seemed like a genuine internal moral conflict would start to brew, with the way the scene was paced and the great acting from Corey Hawkins. But nope, nothing was jeopardized; nothing happened. Every single time something seems to go wrong everyone just walks it off. The lack of character development was just plain annoying.<br/><br/>The pacing was just awful as well. When the car with the klansmen was driving to the house near the end, there was no change in music, or even camera angles. They give you this enormous build-up with the whole meeting with David Duke and the seemingly botched plan, but it only ends up with an explosion that solves the whole problem. No sense of suspense or intensity at all, even though there was a bloody bomb involved. The scene was saved when the police mistook Ron for a rapist, but again, the scene was too slow and there was no atmosphere. What I thought was the climax with the old man's story once again didn't end with anything. I feel like this film was just taking the piss out of my expectations and robbing me of any enjoyment.<br/><br/>And yeah, I did expect a stylish, fast-paced Tarantino-esque flick. But that's not even the issue. Everything is SO in-your-face, there's no interpretation left to the viewer, no hidden message or symbolism. The dialogue just straight up tells the audience what's going on. No sense of mystery, suspense or viewer involvement.<br/><br/>And then the last part with the current footage was just milking it. Maybe it's because I don't live in the US. but it was just such an awkward watch, especially the flag bit. I'm surprised that was really the only violent part of the film.<br/><br/>I think more people are too concerned with the message (which is of course legitimate and current), that they forget about actually being entertained. Before you accuse me of being racist, I myself am coloured and I ENJOY watching these types of films. This was just poor. There are much better movies out there."
"valfatout","8","109","184","28 November 2018"," A funny, gripping and upsetting movie!
","Hi, I'm french and I'm 16. We saw the movie in the cinema with my english class and our english teacher asked to us to write a revue of this movie, and after put in on this website.
Blackkklansman is a movie birected by Spike Lee in 2018. This film is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, a black police officer who wanted to infiltrate the KKK. Inspired by the book, Spike Lee made a film. In the movie we have funny moments and romance too; Ron falls in love with Patrice, a beautiful blanck woman who fights racism. It is certainly at the top od my list of good movies because it is not only about racism, but about several kinds of discrimination, anti-semitism and gender inequality. And so I think that a lot of people can indentify to both characters and realise that discrimination must be fought. And I think that Spike Lee did a good work because hemanaged to make in making a comedy with a dramatic issue, and Adam Driver and John David Washington have a really good actor's game, it couldn't be other actors!
So yes I think that this film is compelling, convincing, realistic, startling and funny, don't miss it!! And there is a lot of reseach from the film director about the KKK, who is a secret organisation of white supremacists directed by Donald Duke and created in 1865 after the Civil War, a war between Northen and Southen states of the USA, the North wanted to abolish slavery and the South didn't. In the movie, we can also see the KKK rites, with the white costums and all tradition. I really enjoyed that because you get out less stupid than you were before seeing the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's a fantastic film, with good actors on the top of that, and you learn a lot about discrimination and humanity, but with funny moments as well. It's a hit and a freat piece of film-making. Go see it!!<br/><br/>Good work, Mr Spike Lee.<br/><br/>Valentine B."
"TheOneThatYouWanted","4","183","321","3 November 2018"," Changing major facts for no reason
","We are living in extremely polarizing times when it comes to race relations. This film is based on a true story about a white man and black man working together to tackle a hate group, and that would have sent such a powerful message. Instead, the white guy's race was changed. And as a fan of the original book, I'm just left scratching my head. And it helps to nullify the dynamic between a white and black person working together; in other words it explains why the first two thirds of the film seems a little boring and almost like filler."
"ThomasDrufke","6","139","245","26 August 2018"," A Powerful Message that Gets Unfortunately Forced on the Audience
","Spike Lee's films have never really resonated with me for whatever reason. BlacKkKlansman is a fascinating story with an average execution at best. Lee brings some solid performances out of Adam Driver and John David Washington, but I'm not sure those characters are fleshed out as much as they should be. But my problem doesn't come with the actors or story per say, but more so with the message that is shoved down your throat. The very beginning and end of this movie present a particular message that is prevalent throughout the film on its own, without the book end scenes. It's a powerful message and reminder for our country, which is still going through its own version of the racism shown in the movie. Perhaps more subtle directing and a better 3rd act would have given this a higher score.<br/><br/>6.4/10"
"jtindahouse","6","123","217","18 February 2019"," Not Best Picture worthy at all
","Every year I make a point of watching each of the Best Picture nominees for the Academy Awards before the ceremony airs. And every year I'm astonished at some of the films that are considered to be the ""best"" of the previous year. 'BlacKkKlansman' is a prime example of this. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a good film? Sure. But is it a great film and one of the eight best released in 2018? Not in this lifetime. Sadly I understand a lot of politics come into the Oscars and I think that is a large part of what is at play here. This is a heavily politically driven film that tugs at the heart-strings of just the right type of people that dominate Hollywood and the Academy. For that reason it gets a nomination. Not because it is a great film.<br/><br/>Adam Driver has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards as well. This was also a baffling one to me. His performance is good and highly watchable, but he never blew me away by any stretch of the imagination. I kept waiting for him to be given one big scene he could really shine through and knock the audiences socks off with, but it never came. A really bizarre nomination from the Academy I would find it extremely surprising if he got the win for this reason.<br/><br/>The film was actually very similar to the 2016 film 'Imperium' starring Daniel Radcliffe. Obviously it didn't have the twist of a black man being behind the infiltration, but a lot of the actual person to person undercover scenes were very similar in nature. I think I enjoyed that film more though because it was more interested in telling you a story, instead of ramming a view down your throat. I also thought the real-life footage shown at the end of 'BlacKkKlansman' was cheap and out of place. A very tacky decision by Spike Lee to throw that in there. I miss the days from the 90s when if a film was nominated for Best Picture you could be assured it was a truly brilliant film. This film doesn't even compare to those."

","NO SPOILERS! <br/><br/>But seriously can I put bad review and not be labeled as racist? FIRST! I did like acting power from most of the cast (really good job), it was filmed in appealing style, and it had its funny moments. <br/><br/>So why 5 stars? <br/><br/>1. Biggest reason is how this movie was adverted. I went to cinema with absolute different vibe and expectations and because of that I could not enjoy movie right after 15-20 min when I felt it isn't what it tried to sell me. 
2. Movie did not bring anything new to the table. It has solid (really good) acting, but it seemed like I'm watching cut-scenes from different movies and put together.
3. It has bad mix between comedy and serious parts. Maybe jokes are too rare or to plain, but it makes you struggle to understand what was directors intentions? 
4. End scenes (this is kinda spoiler, so will not say what was in it) felt really biased and ruined last bits of movie, because it felt too much out of place. It made me feel like all what trailers wanted is me to spend my money and see end scenes of directors views.<br/><br/>I don't mind more political movies, but I felt tricked and movie itself wasn't that good. <br/><br/>I don't want to spoil movie, so I would have more to say, but then it goes in discussion of certain scenes."

"Dan_Sun","3","161","290","2 January 2019"," A ""feel good"" cartoon
","I didn't enjoy this film because it is too cartoonish for a « true story » about a serious matter. I honestly had to check if it wasn't a Disney production.
Ron is obviously a charming prince : handsome, friendly, educated, honest, clever, funny, wise and courageous. He has absolutely no weaknesses and handles his weapon (his phone) with magical dexterity. And of course his hair is perfect, like all princes.
Flip is the faithful and stubborn horse. He galops where he is told to go.
Patrice is a beautiful princess, wild, emotional and idealistic, who lives in the Black Panthers castle.
The bad guys are as naive and stupid as they are cruel. And at the end, the most wicked are dying of their own stupidity, the arrogants are humiliated, the vicious are arrested and everyone gives a standing ovation to the charming prince (even if the only thing he did was to have arrested a minor member of the Klan).
This is a feel-good movie that is very close to « Django Unchained » (or Inglorious Basterds) with the same simple concept : pick real bad guys, make fun of them and kill them. But Tarantino movies are a lot more entertaining, and certainly does not pretend to be « true »."

","The sad thing about the present spate of Hollywood social commentary-infested movies is just how utterly predictable all of them are: once you know the subject matter you know the message, and once you know the message you know the movie you're going to see.<br/><br/>I wanted to hold back on my initial suspicions to give this film the benefit of the doubt, but there was no real reason to - it's a Spike Lee film, and there's a bunch of black people in it: you therefore know what it's going to say and how it's going to say it. You know how every black person's going to behave and you know how every white person's going to behave. And of course they do.<br/><br/>John David Washington can act, but his character, like all the other characters, is little more than a cartoon stereotype, this time with a wig on his head that looks like a microphone pop-shield. The 70s period detail kinda looks like a live-action Scooby-Doo, and the hysterical race war politics crammed into every human interaction with a crowbar kinda resemble something Shaggy might have come up with after too many Scooby Snacks at an Elijah Muhammad rally.<br/><br/>Spike Lee is not a good director, and has never BEEN a good director: he is incapable of telling, pacing and selling a believable story, and his most celebrated works are little deeper and more developed than the average rap video. The only half-entertaining movie he ever made was Inside Man, and I wish he'd go back to the drawing board and learn how to make something like that again. Something with recognizably human characters in a plausible narrative, and at least a little sprinkling of surprise."

","I do appreciate the historical value that some good movies are able to provide while at the same time also combining quality cinematography with superb acting performances through the portrayal(s) of historical figures. But this film does not provide a balance between fine acting and historical documentation. No, what this film provides in my humble opinion is a very left leaning political message.<br/><br/>Adding insult to the intelligence of the producers/directors intended audience is the fact that the film also included actual film footage from the August 2017 clash between white nationalists and counter protesters and how each party blamed one another and the police for the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Va. I am not objecting to the actual footage included at the end of this film, only that it displays an obvious clear bias that one party is racist and violent and that this film only encourages the continuation of hate amongst races based on either the color of one's skin and or choice of religious faith.<br/><br/>As for the acting in this film Adam Driver's performance stood out, but I was less than impressed with either Topher Grace's role as the Grand Klansman David Dukes, or by John David Washington's performance as Ron Stallworth, an undercover cop. But what I was most disappointed with was the screenplay itself which was so one-sided that the audience was expected to believe that the civil rights movement origin was formed by the Walt Disney Mickey Mouse Club.<br/><br/>For Spike Lee to receive an Academy Award for best Director, the year 2018 must have been a very lousy year in the entire film industry. The Academy members were obviously attempting to appease one group for the previous year's/decades of exclusion of the top awards but I expected to see much more from a film that received six (6) Academy nominations. Instead, all I gleaned is frustration from another film in a long line of politically motivated films that wreak with a one-sided view of a suppressed society. I don't call this entertainment at all. This film's only success may be in re-energizing the continuing divide amongst the nation."

His partner is not Jewish as portrayed, Stallworth's entire romance never happened, the bomb plot and klansmens death in the explosion never happened. Boring because there was no violence, no KKK attacks just blabbering endless N word chatter. The lie detector scene, used for suspense, never happened. Boring because the 9 month investigation ended with ZERO arrests. Again, the partner did ALL the undercover work, took all the risks. So no reality based tension. It is said the operation disrupted 2-3 cross burnings and nothing much more. One true funny moment when Stallworth is assigned to guard David Duke and takes a very funny photo with Duke. <br/><br/>The use of Harry Belafonte to retell a lynching story from perhaps the 1910-1920 era was misplaced. He's too recognizable as a 'current' 80+ year old man now in real time. Hence, he could not have been an 80 year old in 1972. An unknown old man should have been used. <br/><br/>30 minutes into the film I am wondering where this 'story' is going. No KKK plots of any kind, no KKK violence of any kind, no real threat to the undercover cop which explains why there were NO arrests ever made.<br/><br/>This 'one joke' premise makes for an interesting event but does not stretch to an entire film. Good acting from the lead actors. Nice music tracks. Boring way too long film. Contrived ending. Could have just shown David Duke surviving and thriving currently."

"Cineanalyst","6","55","113","29 August 2018"," Trumploitation
","Spike Lee has an engaging dramatic-license-taken, based-on-a-true-story with ""BlacKkKlansman,"" of an undercover operation led by a black police officer to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan, and it's ripe for making into a subtle critique of the current Trump presidency and continued violence, including by law enforcement, against African Americans, but subtle Lee is not and, instead, the blunt polemic is hammered into our heads. There's also a nice concurrent theme concerning the mainstream Hollywood white-supremacist epics ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915) and ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939) contrasted with early-1970s blaxploitation films, of which Lee's film aptly borrows much of its style.<br/><br/>I thought ""The Post"" (2017) was too obvious in its paralleling a Nixon-era narrative with current events, but ""BlacKkKlansman"" could've benefited from even that level of understatedness. On one hand, the opening sequence is rather good at connecting all of the threads, with clips from the aforementioned 1915 and 1939 films being projected during the making of Klan propaganda-- the hate speech being delivered by none other than ""Saturday Night Live"" Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin. But, then, the film continues to make certain no member of the audience is left behind in understanding the message. There's the joke that America would never elect a David Duke type, although that was the only part of this rather satirically-approached picture that received a laugh from the audience I was in. The historical events are pushed back to coincide with Nixon's 1972 Southern strategy. And, finally, there's the epilogue of real footage from the 2017 Charlottesville protests and car attack and President Trump's much-criticized remarks thereafter. It's too much.<br/><br/>The cinematic allusions aren't exactly subtle, either, but I think they're sometimes executed better. Although there's a conversation between the lovers debating their favorite blaxploitation flicks, this film also incorporates the genre into its style, including by actually being a film photographed on film. I especially like the brief disco scene, which is energetically compiled. I haven't seen much blaxploitation fare, but of the ones I've seen, they tend to include musical nightclub interruptions to the plot. They also contain scenes where the characters debate opposing sides of the approaches of African Americans to white-dominated America, whether to fight injustices from outside or to reform from within, especially regarding law enforcement. This one does the same thing, including one man becoming a city's first black cop, who, then, poses as white to expose the Klan and another cop, who's Jewish, ""passing"" in predominantly-Christian white America and acting anti-Semitic to infiltrate the same Organization. Similarly, they earlier go undercover at a Black Panther speech by Stokely Carmichael.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Lee's anti-racist polemic can't entirely escape the kind of filmic rhetoric that has underpinned so much of Hollywood cinema all the way back to the racist pomposity of ""The Birth of a Nation."" Just as in the film, the black student union's ""black power"" slogan forms a sound bridge with the ""white power"" chant of the Klan. While surely not hoping for the sort of hooting and hollering of the Klansmen at the racist caricatures of white actors in blackface of the screening of the 1915 film within this film, it may be expected that supporters cheer the message of ""BlacKkKlansman"" just as audiences once roared for the KKK racing to the rescue in the climax of its predecessor. More interesting and likely more successfully than whether this affects the political and racial issues in America is whether Lee has changed the course from within of the white-dominated movie business. It's the Organization he's been infiltrating for some time now."

"adrian-43767","2","45","93","20 March 2019"," Profoundly racist film by Spike Lee
","Spike Lee has, from his earliest film, depicted whites as dumb, exploitative, manipulative, redneck, and uncivilized, among other negative traits.<br/><br/>In contrast, he portrays the black person as the victim, the enslaved soul of goodness trampled underfoot, and demeaned by whites. The only good souls among the latter come from the Jewish, a minority biblically known to include various races, including the Falasha, a black tribe hailing from Ethiopia. In other words, from Spike Lee's standpoint, the only good whites are those who are not completely white.<br/><br/>I am a white born in Mozambique, Africa, and am proud to have had, and to continue to have, blacks, Chinese, Asian Indians, and mulattoes among my friends.<br/><br/>While I find political correctness a destroyer of art, and welcome the fact that Spike Lee does not hesitate to blast it, I find BLACK K KLANSMAN a profoundly racist film. The highly intelligent black rookie quickly outsmarts all daft whites in the police force, launching an investigation into KKK with the very help of the white estabishment Lee so attacks.<br/><br/>Lee directed the excellent 25TH HOUR in 2002. In it he showed talent that he has sadly withheld from the public since. Which is a pity, because he could have been a director of the highest cut. Instead, he has elected to go on racist tirades of dubious moral authority.<br/><br/>Direction is heavy-handed and biased; acting is pedestrian; script is uneven and you have to suspend your desbelief to unbelievable lengths to believe the action (especially when the white woman is trying to plant a bomb in Laura Harrier's post box); and cinematography is mediocre, to put it mildly.<br/><br/>Best avoided, unless you are a diehard Spike Lee fan.<br/><br/>2/10.

","I was looking forward to Klansman, it had an interesting premise and could have been a funny, well written comedic satire.

But apparently Spike Lee doesn't understand this which has resulted in most of the characters just being Spike Lee himself.<br/><br/>Another big issue I had was the jokes seemed to get old really fast. This was because most of them amounted to ""Ha Ha he's actually black"" or ""Look at how stupid these white people are"". <br/><br/>The movie was also incredibly bland as far as the cinematography goes, as most shots were just shot reverse shot. Almost nothing visually interesting happened at all, until the end. But at that point the shots were just so bland and uninteresting it just felt forced.<br/><br/>The one plus side in my opinion would be the performances, because although the dialogue is not well written the actors do a great job delivering their lines with sincerity.

The two most protruding ideas(?) between characters in the film was the conflict of Ron pursing the interest for his people as a cop, and Adam Drivers character overburdened with the role of a white supremacist after all his life never being exposed to that mindset. They were very subtle, but a reminder of how urgent and relevant the conflict of civil rights still was after MLKs death.<br/><br/>The ending was the main point I think Lee tried to convey, how the conflict of race and white supremacy is showing signs of lagging progress almost 40 years later. It's here to make you think and reflect about the hardships and literal fighting people still have to endure, and the lives continually being taken because of the ideals white supremacy and ignorance grasp many Americans."

"ironhorse_iv","7","11","19","7 September 2018"," The invisible empire just got expose, how stupid, they really are. What an intriguing, surreal, funny comedy, this movie was!
","Loosely based on the 2014 real-life memoir by good nature, ex-police officer, Ron Stallworth, originally titled, 'Black Klansman'. This 2018 biographical comedy drama, directed by Spike Lee; told the story of the first African American police detective in Colorado Springs history to ever infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan, successful. Without spoiling, this semi-historical flick, too much, I didn't mind, that the story wasn't as authentic as the motion picture should had been. Most of the major changes the film did; such as adding an imaginary cop hater activist girlfriend, Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier) or made up, Jewish surrogate cop, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) for Stallworth (John David Washington) to hang with, while solving a fictional bombing plot; work for the movie's favor, because it add more tension and suspense. However, having the events take place in 1972, instead of 1979 was a stylistic choice that was a mixed bag for me. While, I like that it allow a complex and impassioned debate about the portrayal of race in the media by referencing both Blaxploitation movies, as well, as political conspiracy thriller from that era. It does sway away, the struggles that Stallworth had to go, to accomplice with his main case. Pessimistically, this part of the film was often, sadly, delayed by other things, Lee wanted to shallowing show us first as well. Like, using film footage from another movie, 1939's 'Gone with the Wind' to open this motion picture up. Then, parodying a supremacy propaganda video with a minor character. Although, those sequences were unique to see. It didn't really help, move the plot, along. Much of the same, can be said, with the drawn out love subplot party scene. Did we really need to see Stallworth, dance to the whole song 'Too Late to turn back now' by Cornelius Bros and Sister Rose? It felt like time wasted. Even scenes that seem more important, like Stallworth, doing undercover work like infiltrating a local rally by national civil rights leader, Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins) ran a little too long. No wonder, why it took forever for the case to take form. The pacing for this movie was way off. Don't get me wrong, I love how that scene is shot, with the lighting experiment, camera zooming in on close up of the bright faces of the crowd, listening to the organizer, surrounded by darkness. It was beautiful. However, the 'Tarzan' speech was kinda theatrical cheesy & forcefully heavy-handed. Not only that, but much of the 'take arms' bullet points, would be repeat, later in the film, anyways, in a jarring badly cut street scene where the black student union debate about having weapons at their protest. In truth, the lecture could had been cut down. Plus, we got a lot more powerful similar speech toward the end, with the film intercuts the KKK doing their rituals and watching director, D. W Griffith 1915's movie 'The Birth of a Nation', with footage of an elderly man, Jerome Turner (Harry Belafonte) illustrates in terrifying detail, how racism films like that, has cause an increase of real-life horrors of cruel and inhumane punishment toward minorities. Still, even that message, the film was somewhat muddled. For example, how on Earth, can Lee denounce one director's use of violent imagery, then, arguably does exactly the same thing, here, albeit from the opposite perspective? I get that, Lee doesn't want to shy away from making connections between the Klan Stallworth infiltrated in the '70s and the Unite the Right Rally of 2017; by having the movie open in theaters on the anniversary week of that tragic event, but having his protagonists, pull out guns and point them at the camera while visuals of modern day racism, both political and national dominates the screen, isn't the right message to give people of today. Anger through violence, in all its enflamed and even cinematic variations, is an emotion that our world could definitely use a little less. We don't need to fuel a future race war. Combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance would had been a better message to the movie with. Regardless of the mixed moral principles of the director, I found Stallworth to be morally sounded character. Thanks from solid dramatic acting chops from Washington during the serious moments of the film. Stallworth is truly dedicated, good-hearted guy who is stuck in rock and hard place; when it comes to his moral duty. Some people think of him, as a traitor to his race, for being a cop, while others, embraced his courage for taking on the KKK. His struggles was compelling. As for actor's comedic side. It did felt like a variety act to the point, that I did mistake him for Chris Redd at certain moment. Nevertheless, his delivery of humor was hilarious, especially with Stallworth interactions with Klan's Grand Wizard, David Duke (Topher Grace) over the phone & during the infamous photography scene. As for the supporting cast. They were equally as good as Washington, both comically and dramatically, with Adam Driver, standing out the most. As for the music. Composer, Terence Blanchard gave out, one of his best. What a haunting, but funky melody. Plus, his use of catchy R&B culture from the 1970s was well capture. Overall: While, I have furthermore, unnamed nitpicks of historical inaccuracies & problems with film message, that I didn't have time or room to mention, here. I still found this movie as one of Spike Lee's best works to the point that I'm willing to gloss over it. It's highly recommended, even if the film is target at an urban African-American audience. It still does have the appeal to many people, pass racial and ethnic lines. Because of that, I believe every person who believe in human rights should watch this movie. It's fundamentally fascinating."

","Great dark comedy. you will be under the table on many occasions. somewhat rough writing but one fun trip. and it was tone deaf to change tone right at the end. Strong casting, nice overall rhythm. IDN was casting of some secondary characters off race intentional or not. but fun to wonder. Poor camera, pretty much no soundtrack. Overall little bit sad to see Lee going crazy again. At some points he would show same cliche driven racist tone that he trying to condemn in this movie. WTF?"
"janmanuel2","5","5","7","2 December 2019"," I deducted stars because....
","I thought the movie was very interesting. I'm so tired of reviewers saying everything is a cliche. There are cliches in just about every movie. I was going to give it a 7 but deducted two stars because of the one sided anti Trump ending. There are far more Antifa violent "" protestors"" than white supremacists currently causing problems in the U.S. To blame Trump for these demonstrations is disgusting. So my new rating is a 5. Keep your Hollywood views out of the movies. This is a based on a true story according to reviewers who were disgruntled that it wasn't totally true in every aspect. The director may have added some fiction to the story but sometimes in order to make a movie that will be entertaining or will flow well that can be a necessity. Could have been better without the scenes at the end."

","I loved this film because on the one hand the story interested me a lot,
and on the other hand, the director, Spike Lee, added several comic scenes.
What interested me is that through fiction, he gives us a real message,
it shows us through images of real facts that the problem is still relevant for years after
this gives a rather shocking, upsetting aspect I will say.
I recommend viewing this masterpiece ยง"
"charlieamargolis","10","6","9","31 March 2020"," An absolute classic in my opinion
","In the 'firing range' scene (my favourite scene), Flip, acting as Ron Stallworth, shoots multiple rounds at a cut out of a black caricature in the presence of the Colorado Springs KKK branch. The sound of the gunshots and the following conversation takes place with no music. As the KKK branch leaves, the camera pans to the large field with the real Ron Stallworth emerging, and the main soundtrack beginning to play. The camera is then set behind the caricature, forcing us to look at Ron through the bullet hole. The scene ends with a close shot of Ron directly facing the caricature, music in full blow. Despite being a movie about the KKK, the Blackkklansman is a film that hardly has the stock image or story that mainstream media has come to tell. Spike Lee's black perspective and reality sheds a light on a part of America's history that I had never thought of with the 'firing range' scene being a perfect example."

"nicholaslance","7","13","24","4 August 2019"," Too Heavy Handed
","As other reviews have said the first and last scenes of the movie shouldn't be a part of the movie. The movie is a reflection of today's politics through the lens of yesteryear. However, the first and last scenes hammer home a singular perspective rather than the more complex reality the rest of the movie reflects.<br/><br/>The issue isn't as simple as white supremacists are bad and still present. Which is pretty much all those scenes say. It is not just one sided. There are the white supremacists, and there is ANTIFA...they are opposite sides of the same coin. The messages might be polar opposites, the attitudes, intolerance, and adhesion to nonsensical dogma is the same.<br/><br/>I felt there were some key scenes that showed how similar the two opposing groups in the film were. Particularly when the female lead calls Ron ""the enemy"" in the end because he is a cop, when in fact he accomplishes far more in regards to her goals than the entire organization she runs. She is narrow minded, inflexible, and unable to see the reality of what he has accomplished.<br/><br/>The entire concept that intolerance isn't unidirectional is completely obliterated by those first and last scenes, where it forces a one sided perspective. Racism isn't a one way street. Intolerance and hate for people that are different isn't just something one side does. The people on the far left, and the far right are the same kind of people, they just hold opposing views."

"hakrames","9","13","24","14 August 2018"," A well worth watch of historical drama-comedy
","BlacKkKlansman stars John David Washington and Adam Driver as it follows the first black police officer in Colorado Springs as he develops an investigation against the KKK and his suspicion on a possible attack they are about to commit. With having Washington coordinating on the phone with the klansmen and Driver meeting them in person to form one person. <br/><br/>This movie I actually have been excited for as I am a fan of Spike Lee and his 'based on true story' films. I loved Malcolm X from him, which ironically had John David Washington in it along side his dad Denzel Washington. And this movie lived up to every expectation I had for it. Spike Lee has always had an interesting way of approaching a topic especially one of controversy like this one. I feel like if any other director took on this film it would come off as being very one sided or even racist. But Lee found that perfect balance with it's amazing visuals and tight dialogue. <br/><br/>Going to writing, this is one of Lee's best written scripts to date. The dialogue is both funny and meaningful to show the characters extremely well and how these two detectives are having to change their own beliefs and the way they talk to fit best with the people they're undercover as. Especially some of the scenes, I was laughing out loud in the theater and enjoying every bit of it. One scene towards the end in particular had me laughing and in shock all at once. <br/><br/>The acting was once again amazing for Lee. Washington did an amazing job for his breakout role on the big screen as Ron Stallworth. He's hilarious and nobel for taking a role that could have been so racist or interpreted as anything but positive. Driver as well gave once again another amazing performance, possible Oscar worthy. And with him coming from an earlier career of R rated comedies, this type of racist jokes and insults almost fit him. Alongside with his quick reactions to his own lines and his pauses and stutters and with him almost fake acting throughout it makes this film feel so real and grounded all at once. Even some of the other cast members like Alec Baldwin, Robert John Burke, Brian Taratina, and Ryan Eggold. Even Topher Grace as David Duke all fit and were both funny and realistic and shockingly portrayed the characters extremely well based on real footage and documents of the real life people. <br/><br/>This film won't be for everyone. They will find it useless or racist or another film to show how bad 'whites' are. But I found this film very enjoyable and entertaining and gave a unique history on our country and what negative things that went on during that time and how it wasn't just a one sided story like what they portray in school or even on documentaries. <br/><br/>BlacKkKlansman gets a 9.75/10"
"Maniac_films","2","34","74","2 March 2019"," Racism Bad
","This movie was all racial anger and no story. Many movies have had similar messages but still manage to tell a good story. Even early spike lee movies have done this very well. This one has nothing to it except its racial message. Topher Grace and another actress managed to give a compelling performance in this poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted movie full of empty charactures. The fact that spike lee thought this deserved the ""best picture"" award over Green Book shows just how cinematically out of touch he has become. Story first, message second next time and you may make a movie rather than another PSA on racism."
"petera00","4","57","132","13 August 2018"," Meh
","This movie is clearly overrated. It'll probably die a death the same way most Spike Lee movies die (Does anyone remember his war movie? And the fact that he used racism to try to promote it - Key Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman). The man hasn't made a good movie in almost twenty years but in today's race baiting society with Drumpf in office - he's making more race related movies. As a whole the movie is very subpar with a funny ending. The guy from that 70's show is excellent as David Duke, but there isn't much else. There isn't anything special about it except for our present time. This movie will probably disappear like almost all of Spike's other movies except for maybe 2. Note to Spike Lee - if you want to make a politically and race agenda driven movie do something like Boots Riley. Don't try to say cops are good people. We all know the justice system is incredibly broken."
"secondtake","7","29","62","6 September 2018"," An entertaining ride through some harrowing material
","BlacKkKlansman (2018)<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is exactly why Spike Lee made it: it is political activism. It's well made and a decent bit of storytelling with good acting and a strong underlying story. But it overtly pushes its message, and makes no effort to hide that.
But this isn't a Michael Moore documentary. This is a film based on a true story, with actors and some embellishments. And it pushes the obvious, clichÃ©s and all. It does this not only in the end and beginning, which are bookends that announce their message, but also in the story itself, by keeping it simple to the point of simplistic. Maybe that's unfair and extreme--on second viewing I realized the movie is first rate filmmaking, whatever its limitations.
If you get the story, and even if you empathize completely with the message, the effect as a movie, as a feature film out to create drama and move and shape you, this effect is flimsy and false. Yes, false even, because you know a grittier, more complicated truth must be there.
You do end up thinking of director Spike Lee's other films here, like the brilliant ""Malcolm X"" and its own historical reconstruction, or ""Do the Right Thing"" with its more fictional immersion and conviction. And this one, ""BlacKkKlansman,"" is less lyrical even though it is quite well filmed, and less moving even though built on compelling facts.
The conventional core of the movie is good (and sometimes fun and funny), with the infiltration of some KKK types (made generally caricatures to the point of being almost comic, which is a shame). However, the last scenes with all the high fives might drive you crazy, and the documentary footage will make you realize there are more penetrating things out there than the movie you just watched.
It's good, I'm glad I saw it, but it's half of what it could have been. But in truth (seeing it a second time), it's very well made and compelling. But for
Spike Lee (at his best) it ends up half of what he has pulled off in the past. Which isn't so bad at all. Watch it!"

"ferguson-6","8","24","50","10 August 2018"," a good one from Spike
","Greetings again from the darkness. Adam Driver impersonating John David Washington or vice versa ... either way is comical, except that it's also based on a true story where their characters existed and this chain of events actually occurred. The source material is the memoir by Ron Stallworth and it's possible, given today's social climate, that only director Spike Lee could pull off a film that so blatantly uses racism for comedic effect, yet also reminds us of its inherent danger. <br/><br/>Mr. Washington (Denzel's son) plays Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs' first black rookie police officer. His job interview is quite awkward and, of course, features a reference to Jackie Robinson. Quickly growing tired of his records room duty, Stallworth's first field assignment is to infiltrate a local black activist group and report back on a Stokely Carmichael/Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins) event. This leads to a much bigger and riskier plan of going after the KKK. Yes that's right, no need to re-read the part about him being the first black police officer. This is the incredible story of how an African-American (with the help of his white partner) worked his way into the KKK, even speaking with David Duke on a few occasions, and ultimately prevented an attack on local black activists.<br/><br/>The adapted screenplay was a collaborative effort from Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, and director Spike Lee. The film is simultaneously laugh outloud funny and provocative. The outlandish plan involves Ron Stallworth (and his white voice) being the telephone connection, and partner (and non-practicing Jew) Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) being the ""white face"" of Ron Stallworth at KKK meetings. There is extreme tension during Zimmerman's undercover scenes, and much of the humor occurs during Stallworth's phone conversations. Topher Grace is extremely effective as David Duke, a thankless role to say the least.<br/><br/>Superb support work is widespread in this film that runs 2 hour and 15 minutes. Robert John Burke plays a no-nonsense Chief Bridges; Frederick Weller is racist jackass patrolman Andy Landers; Laura Harrier is Patrice, the Angela Davis lookalike activist and love interest; Jasper Paakkonen plays skeptical and high-strung Klansman Felix; Paul Walter Hauser (I, TONYA) is the comical and unnerving Ivanhoe; and even Harry Belafonte makes a surprise big screen appearance. Other notables include Alec Baldwin (in an opening that sets the stage), Nicholas Turturro, Damaris Lewis, Ryan Eggold, Isiah Whitlock Jr, and Arthur J Nascarella. It's a terrific and deep cast and they walk the fine line between entertainment and enlightenment. There is no shortage of Hollywood family genes and blending thanks to: Washington, Baldwin, Turturro, Buscemi, and Weller (it plays like 2 degrees of separation).<br/><br/>A low-budget look to the film gives it an authenticity and 1970's vibe, and cinematographer Chayse Irvin works wonders with the camera in a multitude of situations where our attention should be on the dialogue of the characters rather than the colorfulness of set pieces. Black Ron running the show from a telephone (and a white voice) and White Ron face-first in the muck both have their burdens to bear, and much of the time, Zimmerman's is the more interesting of the two - although as a whole, it's an astonishing story.<br/><br/>Perhaps Spike Lee set out to make the polar opposite of D.W. Griffith's 1915 most controversial film THE BIRTH OF A NATION, and he has certainly crafted one of the most effective films of his oeuvre. He also nails a few jabs at Trump and the current political climate, while the music from Terrence Blanchard perfectly complements the tone. Mr. Lee interjects some historic moments as well as some fictional ones - none more powerful than the back and forth chants of ""White Power"" ""Black Power"". At the conclusion, Lee serves up footage of Charlottesville, reminding us that the racism that caused us chuckles over the past couple of hours, remains prevalent today ... only that's not the least bit funny."
"jg_1977","9","12","22","13 August 2018"," And the Oscar goes to...
","BlacKkKlansman is an expertly made movie in every conceivable way. The acting, directing, writing, cinematography, editing, and music all mesh wonderfully to create one of my favorite movies of the year so far. I have been hearing about BlacKkKlansman all summer long as it came hot off the festival circuit, so my expectations were high, and boy did it live up to them. With the exception of a few on-the-nose lines, Spike Lee wrote and directed a movie that subtly and almost flawlessly drew stark comparisons with America today and the turmoil of the early 1970s. Detective Ron Stalworth is a torn man. Torn between helping to liberate and empower black Americans and uphold the law. How he manages to tow the line is by infiltrating and sabotaging the local KKK chapter. This movie is funny, poignant, and most of all horrifying. Like many movies that depict the race relations of the post-civil rights era, there are scenes and characters in this movie that will make your skin crawl and make you feel sick to your stomach. However, it's not without it's charm. Lee inserts just enough larger than life humor to keep you from becoming completely emotionally spent. The acting is also superb throughout, with every single major and minor character giving it their all. John David Washington was amazing as the lead, but Topher Grace and Adam Driver stole the show for me. I hope all three of these actors are in the conversation come Oscar season. Speaking of awards, I will be truly amazed if BlacKkKlansman doesn't just clean up next year at the Oscars. As I said, I thought every piece of this movie was well executed, but I in particular will be upset if it doesn't get nominations for directing, adapted screenplay, and of course best picture. This movie is not only wildly entertaining but also gravely important. I hope every person in America sees this movie because its message needs to be shared."

"freeds","4","32","71","24 September 2018"," Exciting mash-up of dangerous lies and important truth about racism
","""Black KKKlansman"" is based on the memoir of a black former cop. The job of police (black and white alike) is to keep workers and the oppressed in line on behalf of the owning class, with blacks at the bottom as a special target of state brutality from slavery on. While spying on the Klan in the '70s with the help of a white colleague, the black cop also infiltrated the multiracial, worker-oriented Progressive Labor group. Police historically disrupt progressive organizations, while generally protecting those of racists and fascists -- the rulers' reserve army. Over and over they cover for individual cop acts of racist brutality. How does Spike Lee handle these facts? He ignores his hero's work against PL and invents an episode in which the police department opposes a racist in its ranks. <br/><br/>The movie does show racism (still) rampaging, stoked by the rulers' present front man. Against this unavoidable truth, the filmmaker counterposes messages and protests rejecting hate. Their wishful moralizing is about as useful as a silk shirt against a bullet. Our defense depends not on cops, or mockery of the racists, or ""love,"" but on the power of the multiracial working class. <br/><br/>A new rating is in order: This exciting entertainment for anti-racists should be viewed through class-reality lenses.

"TheMovieDiorama","8","56","134","28 August 2018"," BlacKkKlansman doesn't hold back addressing the current political/racial climate.
","Truth be told, I've not been looking forward to reviewing this. Much like Spike Lee, I have much to say regarding the apparent racial clash in America's modern-like society that feels more archaic than ever. However, I shall be discarding my political views from this review and strictly taking the time to critique Lee's boisterously powerful drama. Chronicling the true story of a black detective infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan to prevent any attacks that may result in a race war. An absolutely fascinating case that metaphorically represents a variety of multi-dimensional themes. A black individual joining an all-white clan, without them identifying him, shows that all races are able to integrate and reside peacefully in cohabitation. We are all law-abiding citizens. We are all integral components in society. We are all the same, regardless of skin colour. The KKK contrasts with former Black Panther Party members in the method they choose to rally up support. The former are likened to a terrorist organisation where actions speak louder than words, whereas the latter utilise the power of words to incite their followers, not to provoke them, but to motivate them in expressing themselves for a revolution. That's not a biased representation from Lee, it's fact. This is not a subtle depiction of a minority dealing with the remaining racists of society. This is a message. A message of power, liberation and revolution. The several screenwriters, including Lee, remove all expletive barriers. Nearly every offensive, racial and derogatory word is embedded within the sharp screenplay. It irrefutably has bite, and immediately absorbs you into the visceral environment of 70s America. Illustrating the racial ideology of white supremacism for both political and socioeconomic systems against a contemptuous backdrop. It's provocative, making your inner activism rise as the narrative progresses. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the script's focus is still on the plot, and it remains enthralling throughout. Balancing astute contemporary humour with uncompromising speeches where we cling onto every spoken word, witnessing Lee's illustrious perspective on black power through the medium of film. I'm not overtly familiar with his filmography, but there is no denying that his ability to address important issues without conforming to melodrama is nothing short of genius. His precise directing allows the cast to integrate themselves as part of the story. Washington portraying naivety through sarcastic wit and energetic bodily movements enabled him to be a likeable character amongst a sea of societal regression. But, yet again, Driver steals the screen. His acting is effortless and still remains one of the most credible actors working today. His comedic timing, calm demeanour and emotional conviction all amalgamate to create an authentic character portrayal. There is no denying that this is a timely film that is more important than ever given current situations, which are highlighted in the final five minute sequence. Yet, I do have some issues. <br/><br/>Regardless of my political and social views, I find injecting one's opinion into a film so forcibly, considering the basis of the film is the depiction of a true story, to be distasteful. Understandably, Lee utilises the case to compare the similarities of today's society with that of 70s America. But in doing so, the consistent sly remarks against the Trump administration tainted the tone of the film and instead started to become a personal attack. It is a personal statement, I get that. And Lee clearly wanted to share his viewpoint with the rest of the world. It just needed less lambaste in order to maintain the professionalism that was nested throughout the rest of the film. It didn't help that those particular scenes were embedded within the clunky narrative, furthering its own dispensability. However, the unique prowess of BlacKkKlansman should not go unnoticed. Both important and entertaining, Spike Lee is back on top form, and he has something to say."

","There is a lot to really like about this film. The casting is spot on, with Driver, Washington and Grace all turning in great performances. The story unfolds, for the most part, in an interesting way (eg Ron dismissing Birth of a Nation as ""just a film"", then witnessing first hand how the white supremacists reacted to watching it). The 'organisation' were displayed (apart from two of the characters) as obviously non-stupid and politically minded. The black power speech was shot in an interesting way (a la Metropolis), and we even got a signature Spike Lee dolly shot near the end which I had been hoping for the entire way through.<br/><br/>However, a couple of moments I just couldn't help feeling let the film down. Driver hitting the targets in shooting practice and Felix noticing he was a good shooter, whilst he had already shot at and missed the car was stuck in there for pacing and to raise the tension. Felix should probably have taken more action when he was told Driver was actually a cop called Zimmerman. His character in particular seemed to flip between astute and plain stupid.<br/><br/>The racist cop was too cliche for me, too. It would have been nice to show the racism in the police force at a more institutional level, rather than opting for just one individual to be the scapegoat, and he made some poor character decisions. I wouldn't have thought even the stupidest racist would have been as overtly aggressive to Ron in front of their own police chief.<br/><br/>I thought the relationship between the President of the student union and Ron was barely developed at all, and probably didn't need to be there. It could have carried even if Ron just had an adulation for her, rather than a love interest.<br/><br/>All minor points, though, as the film is enjoyable and is relatively successful with its message. I understand the marketing as specially a black comedy, which dragged more people into the cinema to see it expecting another Get Out or something like Black Dynamite, leaving a few people confused on here (funny that so many of the bad reviews are littered with spelling mistakes... Alec Baldwin's character much?). <br/><br/>The film ends in a powerful way. A few people have called it cheap, but when the message is this important it's important that we don't leave the theatre celebrating anything. The real Ron Stalworth has said that racism hasn't changed one bit since the 1970s. Spike Lee does a wonderful job showing how racism began to become more subversive and structured in the 70s, and, in case you missed the 3 or 4 times during the film the characters alluded to present day Trumpisms, it's only right you end the film with Trump's language describing the neo-Nazis as ""not nice"", but the victims as ""violent"".<br/><br/>Very enjoyable film, carried by those three performances in particular."

","Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is the first black police officer in 1970's Colorado Springs, Colorado. He faces racism in the department and is eager to go undercover. His first assignment is to attend a speech by a former Black Panther. He starts dating Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of the Black Student Union. After reading an ad in the newspaper, he calls up the KKK to apply for membership. He is readily accepted by local leader Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold) with only one problem. He can't meet Breachway face to face. He recruits Detective Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to be the face while he provides the voice. Eventually, he would even connect with Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace).<br/><br/>Flip's infiltration into the local KKK is compelling. It seems immediately stupid that Ron continues to do the calls. It's not a carefully conceived investigation. Also the third act bombing is too conveniently staged. It needs to be more realistic and more messy. It wraps up too neatly. There are aspects that feels too artificial which detracts from the tension. The subject matter requires the movie to be more real. At times, Spike Lee pushes into satire territories but nevertheless, it is still one of his better recent movies."

I've never seen a Spike Lee film that I thought was anything above mediocre. I'm not sure why the man is so popular: His work is very immature.

","BlacKkKlansman Review:<br/><br/>BlacKkKlansman is the true story of Ron Stallworth, a black policeman, who infiltrated the KKK by calling them on the phone and sending Flip Zimmerman, a Jewish policeman, to pretend to be him. I was excited to see this movie for a long time. I'm surprised that this story hadn't been made into a movie yet. This has got to be one of the best movies of the year! It was so entertaining and kept the audience's attention the whole time. John David Washington did absolutely phenomenal! His character was very interesting and he portrayed him very well. Adam Driver also did one of his best performances. Ryan Eggold as KKK member Walter was very good as well. I loved the direction by Spike Lee. Probably his best movie. The tone of the movie was great. It was a comedy but there were scenes that were dramatic and emotional. It reminded me of I, Tonya. I loved the editing for it! It felt like the 70s. Same with the score for the film. At the end of the movie they played scenes of how black people are treated today and how they still face racism and hate. It was very emotional and necessary. I loved everything about this movie, except for that it was just a little too long due to some scenes lasting longer than needed. I really don't want to say much else about the film because you should go into it without knowing much. Definitely see BlacKkKlansman. You won't regret it!<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

","""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018 release; 135 min,) brings the (true) story of Ron Stllworth. As the movie opens, we get a clip from Gone With the Wind, the famous scene where Scarlett walks among the hundreds, if not thousands of wounded soldiers, with the camera eventually catching the Confederate flag. After that, we are introduced to Ron Stallworth, an African-American interviewing for, and getting, a job on the Colorado Springs Police Department, the first African-American to do so (we are in 1974, as we see ""Re-elect Nixon"" signs). The Department is blatantly racist on many levels. After a rough start, Stallworth asks, and gets, to be assigned as an undercover cop. Then one day, he sees an ad for the local chapter of the KKK in the local newspaper, and decides to call the telephone number in the ad. Much to his surprise, he makes headway in the KKK's local chapter... At this time we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: writer-director Spike Lee has known many ups and downs in his 3+ decade career, and this surely is one of the ups. Taking an obscure fait diver from 40+ years ago (a back man infiltrating the KKK!), Lee builds it into a timely political movie about today's leadership in Washington. Yes, let's just say it: David Duke, featured prominently, is projected as a precursor of the current POTUS. ""Make America great again!"", and later ""America first"" are used in the film. If it looks a bit heavy-handed, it frankly is. The movie benefits greatly from the charming performances by its leads, John David Washington as Ron Stallworth and Adam Driver as fellow undercover cop Flip Zimmerman (and stand-in Ron Stallworth). Laura Harrier has a breakout performance as Stallworth's romantic interest. On the negative side, the movie's running time is way, way too long (by a good 20-30 min.). Yet all that said, none of this would matter if it weren't for the last 5 min. of the movie, which all brings it home so pointedly (no worries, I won't spoil). You could hear a pin drop in the theater where I saw this during the movie's conclusion...<br/><br/>""BlacKkKlansman"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to immediate acclaim (it won the Grand Prix), and was released wide this weekend. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED. Given the inherently controversial nature of this film, I have no idea whether this will be a box office smash, but that isn't even the main point. If you have any interest it the racial divide that exists in this country, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"jdesando","Null","32","73","9 August 2018"," Lee is a master of entertaining film and racial realism. Thiis is no exception.
","In the '70's race relations were détente at best, nowhere better exemplified than by the Colorado Springs Police Department, where black Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) was a detective. Not just any detective, for the true story of his infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan is smartly re-created by acclaimed director Spike Lee in BlacKkKlansman.<br/><br/>Lee opens with a claim that sets his wide-ranging tone: ""Based on Some Fo' Real, Fo' Real."" His subsequent illustration with D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind, however, shows that the deeply serious subject of BlacKkKlansman is racial terrorism.<br/><br/>The biography and satire are best at showing the racism still prevalent at that time, especially the Klan's fervid hatred of Jews and blacks. The infiltration of the Klan is uniquely pulled off by splitting up Stallworth into his white phone voice and in person using the white Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to substitute for Stallworth. <br/><br/>When Lee uses Alec Baldwin to play a pro-segregation narrator who keeps fumbling and forgetting his lines, Lee is at his best with trenchant satire going down easily with a bit of humor. In some ways, this film approaches the brilliance of Lee's Do the Right thing.<br/><br/>Lee, who inherited this project from Jordan Peele, keeps the action moving, as if it were a top cop show in the '70's with low-key humor and slow revelations accompanied by crisp performances and an air of professionalism. Most notably toward the end are Lee's obvious references to current authoritarian, racist administrators at the highest levels of society.<br/><br/>The claim by one character that the level of bigotry and racism would never happen again received chuckles from our audience. Yet, more seriously from Mr. Lee himself:
""We are living in pure undiluted sanity. Families are being stripped apart, kids put in cages, that's going back to our ancestors being broken up and sold. That's the world we live in."""
"jormungandr-64417","2","21","45","10 March 2019"," More like a YouTube type movie.

"Jared_Andrews","10","54","132","21 August 2018"," Spike Lee at his best
","Spike Lee's talent never left. As is the case with great filmmakers, his perspective, his style and his vision have been present in all his work. As is also the case with great filmmakers, some of his work simply towers above the rest. 'Blackkklansman' is one of those towering achievements. <br/><br/>The film is difficult to classify because it transcends a single genre. At various times it's funny, dramatic, suspenseful, provocative. Often, it's many things at once. The one consistency of this heterogenous mixture, is excellence.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a college graduate, Ron Stallworth, who becomes the first black person to work for the Colorado Springs Police Department. Playing Ron is John David Washington, who, like his father, Denzel, carries himself and speaks with composure and power. He has a way of calmly making his presence felt without ever posing a threat, which is why the police chief believes he can command respect and handle the abuse he will surely take from the racist civilians (and fellow officers). <br/><br/>Ron quickly wins a chance to go undercover at a speaking event for a former black panther leader. His task to learn if the speaker is looking to incite violence (he's not). After a successful first mission, Ron is assigned to undercover work, and, one a whim, calls the number for the local KKK that he read in the paper. Buttering up the Klan-or as they call themselves, the organization-with fake white supremacist talk, he arranges a meeting. Since he's black, he teams up with a white officer, Flip (Adam Driver, who is spectacular in his role), to form the combined Ron Stallworth. It works like a charm because, as the real Ron says, ""with the right white man, we can do anything."" <br/><br/>Spike Lee is fair in his portrayal of everyone. Within some of the Klansman, there exists a puzzling contradiction-they're polite, courteous, and charismatic, but they're also despicable racists. Klan national director, David Duke, gracious to all the people all the white people he meets, but also says things like, ""blacks are an in inferior race. It's a fact."" Topher Grace plays Duke, a challenging role, with nuance and something that resembles likability (aside from the racism, obviously). Duke and a couple other Klansman are the kind of people that you could meet without knowing anything about them, and you might describe them as gentlemen. That is, until they slip a racist comment into conversation. <br/><br/>Other members of the Klan are slobbering, disgusting overt racists. Both types of people feel real, because they both are. <br/><br/>The police are portrayed fairly too. Some are evolved, others are trying but not quite there, and others are just as appalling as the slobbering, disgusting overt racist Klansman. <br/><br/>Spike Lee is at his best, as he typically is when working with material about race in America. Subtlety isn't always his strength or his intention, hence the mix of over-the-top and subtle racism. He opts to hammer home his message at the film's closing with some footage of last year's march in Charlottesville and the sound bites from a certain political figure that followed. Some viewers may argue that this footage wasn't needed. I think the film would work fine without it, but it certainly adds an extra punch.<br/><br/>The film's narrative is so utterly fascinating as a crime story that the elements of race could be removed and the movie would still work. But, it's the poignant social commentary that elevates the project to best picture contention. <br/><br/>There's so much going on that it's definitely a movie that needs to be watched twice. As great as it is the first time, I imagine that it's even better on the second viewing. <br/><br/>In any case, 'Blackkklansman' is one of the best movies of the year and one we will likely be thinking about for a long time."

"plex","6","8","14","12 January 2019"," Too neat, dumbed-down, and pretty.
","Spike condescends his audience by dumbing-down the narrative in his latest mainstream project.
The premise is solid: a burgeoning revolution in the war against racism, and the elevated actions on either side to actualize results. It's not obvious to me if the ""true"" story wasn't being introduced NOW to show the obvious parallel to Trump, or if it was a docudrama period-piece to be consumed on its own merit.
There is some high-quality film making here, especially the camera work, staging and a lot of production techniques. Good editing. The capable ensemble had to contend with a script that is a bit stiff and cliched replete with cartoonish characters. Ron Stallworth and Flip Zimmerman are not very credible. Stallworth, a black rookie cop in a time when black cops were frowned upon within the force, seemingly knows more than the rest of his superiors, and is given command over investigative force mere weeks after being a file clerk. His voice sounds nothing like Zimmermans but apparently it fools everyone, including David Duke who prides himself on detecting black dialect. All of the white characters are written as morons which is typical in Spike films. Granted, I don't have much love for the white characters in this film, but some of them are so far over the top Like Andy Landers and Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard, plus a character who borders on being completely mentally challenged who I can't find on the IMDB cast list. Everything seems to fall into place for our protagonist Stallworth, even the end when Landers gets busted out of the blue and completely out of context, to cross some perverbial-T. It was a loose-end that didn't need to be tied. One bright spot: Harry Belafonte makes an appearance to give a history lesson into the atrocities of the Klan and their acceptance into southern white culture, is disturbing, but again, watered-down and grandstanding. Spike needs to take bigger risks with his film-making and stop worrying that he's going to piss-off the wrong white person who green-lights his films, and just go for it, he's got the chops, he simply needs to get himself dirty. As it stands, he's to neat and pretty."
"christianrmaxwell","9","8","14","14 September 2018"," A Tense, Funny Ride through an Insane Story
","Before this movie, I had never heard of the absolutely insane true story about a Black man essentially infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan. If you would have told me that it was a true story, I would have immediately said you were lying. But surely enough, based on the book written by none other than Ron Stallworth, this movie chronicles the insanity and also hilarity at the mere concept of this true story. The movie has extremely well pacing, there is never a dull moment. Spike Lee knows exactly what he wants to accomplish with each scene he presents, and boy does he exceed that accomplishment. Now that's not to say this movie is absolutely flawless, there were a few shots that I just found completely unnecessary and absolutely strange in the way that Lee directed it. Now, especially for me, weird shots in movies are not a bad thing at all, just look at Sorry to Bother You, my second favorite movie of the year, it was filled to the brim with weird shots that did not make any sense. However, in the context of that movie, it seemed to fit more. Because while Sorry to Bother You was definitely more geared towards comedy, this movie is first and foremost a drama/thriller. And therefore some of the bizarre stylistic choices just didn't work for me. However, that is my only complaint for the movie, the rest is absolutely amazing, from the acting to the character development, to the comedy. The one thing that I did not fully expect when walking into this film was purely how funny it was going to be. I expected there to be a few chuckles here and there but there were honestly some sequences that had me laughing out loud. One of the things I appreciate most about this movie is how Lee presents not only the KKK side of the ""race war"" but also the Black Panther side of things as well. He does not necessarily paint an obvious picture as to who is the bad guy and who is the good guy. There are three total groups that are looked at during the course of this movie, the Police force, the KKK, and the Black Panthers. And every single one of them has things that they were doing wrong. None of them were perfect, and I appreciated that view of things because it seemed more like Lee was just presenting history rather than trying to put his own biases into it. The acting here is all phenomenal, specifically from Topher Grace playing David Duke and Adam Driver as Flip. And of course, John David Washington did an excellent job as the main character. This movie, while somewhat flawed, is excellent and definitely up there in the list for movies of the year."

","When I heard about the bizarre story of a black American cop who apparently infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in Colombo, Ohio, I assumed it would be tongue-in-cheek, and possibly 'true' in the same sense as the Coen bros' 'Fargo'. I was taken with the mad Afro hairdos depicted in the trailer. When I heard it was a Spike Lee film, I thought it had a chance of being very good, and happily I wasn't disappointed. For me, BlackkKlansman is a return to top form for Mr Lee.
While it is a very entertaining film, it packs a real punch to the guts at the same time. It feels like a blast from the past with respect to the openly institutional racist attitudes, but sadly by the end we're all reminded that it never really went away, and the white supremacists are just as misguided and dangerous now as they were in the '70's.
John David Washington (son of Denzel) was a revelation. I was intrigued as to why such a talented actor took so long to emerge into the limelight, then I discovered he had a career in NFL first. A talented man, then, just like his father. He shows every sign of successfully emerging from Denzel's shadow and having a blistering acting career of his own. He really owns the role of Ron Stallforth.
Adam Driver was also excellent as Ron Stallworth's colleague and accomplice in face-to-face meetings with Ku Klux Klan members.
I don't know how true to Ron Stallworth's 'memoirs' BlackkKlansman is, but I imagine there will have been some dramatisation to make it more filmic. Having said that, there were a few bits which seemed just a little contrived. Even these moments didn't take me out of the story, though, so the overall feeling I was left with was one of satisfaction, which juxtaposed sharply with the jaw-dropping finale, as I'm sure Spike Lee intended.
If you're not sure this film is your thing, I wasn't sure it would be mine either (I don't usually go in for social conscience stories), but I can't reccommend it highly enough. This just might be the best film you see all year."

Adam Driver did a good job playing the hard nose cop who has some problems of his own, and he really showed passion. Topher Grace was good as KKK leader David Duke, and his conversations with Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) were some of the best parts of the movie. This movie has a unique blend of comedy and drama, and doesn't have any sex, and barely any violence.

I do ni agree with others who say Spike Lee is a racist Man,he shows just one side of the USA it's false.It's true je campaigns for the African-American cause but it's not just for Black people,it's algo against xenephobia,anti-semitism and for minorities' rights.He only shows what really happened in the United States.it's also a burning issue these days.There are a lot of people who don't want black people and immigrants on their country.I know it's a disturbing subject but we can't say he is a racist director.He just wants to attract people's attention.

It's this decision not to leave anything to interpretation that gives the piece its real sense of urgency, as it feels as though it's grabbing you by the shoulders, shaking you as hard it can and yelling, ""look at what's happening, still to this day - wake up!"" It really is a powerful experience, one that feels especially relevant today; it's very much a response to America's current political climate. It isn't always a pleasant watch (by necessity) and often evokes a real sense of anger, both at its more deplorable characters and at its overall situation. However, the feature somehow manages to be entertaining, harrowing, moving, frightening, funny, vexing, ironic and sobering all at once. It seems to encapsulate everything, to say all that needs to be said, and it feels really significant in a way that's difficult to describe.

Throughout the film, there are not-so-subtle nods to the US President's rhetoric and how it echoes the KKK's leader David Duke: at one point he says he wants 'to make America achieve its greatness again' and chants 'America first!' during a speech. <br/><br/>The messages the film is trying to get across are not subtle, but it doesn't have to be when the messages have never been irrelevant. At one point, the true and horrific story of the public torture and execution of 17-year-old Jessie Washington in 1916 is told. This story is unfolding as the camera cuts back and forth to the Klan's initiation meeting which makes for a powerful scene of intense juxtaposition (Lee explained in the post-film Q&A that, ironically, this cross cutting technique was invented by the director of Birth of a Nation, an intensely racist pro-KKK 1915 film).<br/><br/>The final minutes are fearful to watch as Lee brings us to the present time and the last few shots (which I won't spoil here) left me with a genuine tear in my eye and an uneasy feeling in one of the most basic, primitive part of my being - fear for the minds of my fellow man and the state of the world I'm meant to be leaving to my children.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""America would never elect someone like David Duke as President."" - ""Coming from a black man, that's pretty naïve."""

"thedoctor205","8","26","59","11 August 2018"," Spike Lee's Best Work Since Malcolm X
","One of the most moving yet hilarious films I've seen this year. Spike Lee knocks it out of the park with his best work since Malcolm X.<br/><br/>John David Washington is so great in his role. He's got a real commanding presence and I can't wait to see him in future projects. Other actors worthy of a shoutout are Adam Driver (who gives the best performance I've seen from him since Silence, although he really is great in everything I see him in), Topher Grace is haunting yet captivating as David Duke, and lastly a tiny shoutout to Ryan Eggold who is hilarious and slightly likeable (despite being a Klansman). <br/><br/>Besides the acting, I also thought the script was great. It was hilarious and intense, just like Get Out. The cinematography is great as well. Lastly, I know a couple people didn't like the ending. Unashamedly, I thought it was great, obviously not in a good way. It took you out of the movie, but that's what it was supposed to do. It was a presentation of sorts, like ""We showed you this, now look at this and think about how we feel."" It was something that stood out and I support it.<br/><br/>I have some issues however, none that made me dislike it in any way. I don't think some choices necessarily fit as much as they thought it did. I know it was Spike Lee's vision, but I just don't think it fit. For example, when Ron and Patrice are walking/talking about blaxploitation films, the posters of such films pop up on the screen. It took me out immediately. It just felt like Lee was saying in all caps ""THIS IS YOUR HOMEWORK!"" I just don't think the posters popping up was needed. Another example is during Kwame Ture's speech, where the camera shows distinct faces flying across the screen. I know Lee probably had a meaning to it, I just didn't really think it fit. Aside from that, I wasn't really a fan of the editing. It was kinda strange. It would cut to different shots every word a character spoke some times which just looked odd. It was distracting, but it didn't make me hate the movie or anything. Lastly, I think it went a bit too far on some things that took unnecessary time out of the movie. The primary example is a 4-minute scene where Lee is calling out Trump. I'm all for it, but I felt it should have focused on the story at hand rather than waste time on something he touches on at the end.<br/><br/>Despite that, I still think BlacKkKlansman is one of the best films of the year and I think it's message is strong. I liked that it showed both sides of the cop/racism incident. I don't think it's better than Get Out, but the importance is just as big. I had chills at the end like everyone else in the theatre and I truly believe BlacKkKlansman will hold up in the time to come.<br/><br/>8.7/10"
"ryanbartlett-870-746486","8","29","67","28 August 2018"," A forceful yet necessary film that shows how the past repeats itself
","Taking a unique style on a timely subject, BlacKkKlansman is a film that shoots right for your face and doesn't let you beat around the bush. The film intros with Alec Baldwin creating a promotional video for the KKK. Whilst standing in front of a projector displaying videos across his body, it quickly cuts between many different takes with misspoken racist words Immediately establishing the parody that the movie was based upon. 
 The film follows an African-American police officer Ron Stallworth, played by John David Washington, who successfully infiltrates the KKK. With a very obvious problem of him not being KKK material, he enlisted the help of fellow white officer Flip Zimmerman, played by Adam Driver, who must act as him when meeting with the ""organization's"" members.
 Director Spike Lee took a very in your face approach to the film, not cutting anything out, going into great detail, and at some points pushing the envelope as far as he could. With many scenes filled with racist rants from KKK members, there is no way this film could be watchable by non-racist people without a superb director at the helm. Lee was able to give you a great balance that brought you to the edge of your seat without you falling out. He breaks up these hard to watch scenes with well-timed humor, and an overarching aura of ridiculousness and unbelievability. Many times throughout the film, your caught thinking to yourself that there is no way they can be serious, that no sane person could actually think these things. But the more unbelievable fact is that people did and some still do.
 John David Washington is a perfect fit for the role, he plays the very clever but quirky black cop in a white world to a tee. Giving a performance that is believable without hesitation. Paired with the up and down Adam Driver, playing a similar style character as from ""Logan Lucky"", always seems to find his way into these bizarre roles. He has a knack for embodying a slightly redneck character who doesn't give off a complete feeling of confidence. And it works. Each character is able to bounce off the next and not necessarily put in performances to remember, but performances that don't get in the way of the voice and message of the movie. 
 BlacKkKlansman does an incredible job of showing both sides of not just the KKK but also the Black Panthers. Maybe leaning towards one and not the other, but it gives a window into how these groups were organized and what they stood for. Juxtapositioning ""White Power"" with ""Black Power,"" the movie leaves the audience with evaluating not just their own beliefs but where the state of the country is. Moreover, the entire movie you are thinking how ridiculous these people's thoughts are and how could anyone really believe this. Then the film ends showing footage from Charlottesville and reminding us that those people aren't gone. There are still many people today who think this is how it really should be. 
 This day and age, movies are coming out about black people, women, gay people, and the underclass that are beginning to show to the country that there is whole other sides of life that we aren't used to seeing in popular culture. Spike Lee definitely joined in to that message now, and it's a push that will begin to hopefully educated the masses on what this country truly looks like. Especially if movies are going to be this well made, there is not an end on the horizon."

"masonfisk","8","13","26","21 August 2018"," Power to the person...!
","Spike Lee's new film about a black policeman who infiltrated the KKK via phone during the 1970's is a triumph of audacious premise & topical racial politics. Denzel Washington's son plays the detective w/a command of the material & a swagger matching his dad's best performances (What a conundrum to make a trip to the multiplex & having to pick either of the Washington films to see). Also w/Adam Driver & Laura Harrier (from Spiderman: Homecoming) this is being hailed as one of Lee's best but forget the hype, just see the film to witness a moment in history we're unlikely to forget."
"rich-37209","9","13","26","14 August 2018"," Worth it for the last 5-minute kicker alone
","Didn't know if this was going to be a comedy or serious, based on the trailer. And I suppose it has some of both, though the subject matter is grim and very serious indeed. But the last 5 minutes really blew me away, as a huge eye-opener to the way things are in the US at the moment. However, I am afraid even unmistakable proof of Trump being a card-carrying member of the KKK will not not endanger his presidency one iota."
"stephenmatlock","9","43","105","13 August 2018"," Tremendous, brutal, funny, gripping
","I had no expectations of this other than it has been getting mad props from my friends all over America who've already seen it in the past few days since it opened. <br/><br/>The gist of the story is a singular black cop on the otherwise all-white Colorado Springs police force who on a wild impulse decides to interact with the KKK. Because he is young and impulsive, he dials the KKK directly and uses his real name. Because a black man would not be able to fit in, he enlists the help of a white cop for in-person interactions, but keeps his phone interactions, especially with David Duke. (Yes, THE David Duke.) One thing leads to another, and the KKK thugs in Colorado Springs are broken apart--but his work is shredded and the police department decide to pretend nothing happened at all. <br/><br/>All this is most wonderful, especially the final scene in the first part, which is a final phone call between the black cop and David Duke. The audience broke up shouting and laughing at this, and it was emotionally satisfying.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't over.<br/><br/>This final scene is followed by intercuts of recent actions in today's America, and the mood of the audience--and myself--changed to one of sober reflection and emotional distress. In summary: nothing much has changed, and even the heroism of many people has done almost nothing to affect the rise of Naziism and fascism and race-hatred in America.<br/><br/>With all that said -- <br/><br/>The movie is very well constructed, and feels very late-70s. I enjoyed seeing and hearing the lives of people living in that time--costumes and sets and dialog were pretty much spot on. The entire premise was believable even though the story comes about because an eager black cop decides to take on the KKK and then finds he can't get by without the help of his friends. <br/><br/>The movie would be one, complete thing had it ended at the phone scene--and yet the movie would not be complete without the codicil that confronts us with our world of today, where the KKK and Nazis and fascists and white nationalists and alt-rightist are sometimes clowning--but are becoming more and more bold and more and more invasive and more and more successful.<br/><br/>Charlottesville happened not just because people don't stand against Nazis at all levels, from the farm house to the White House, but because too many people feel ""it just can't happen here.""<br/><br/>Good work, Mr. Lee and others."
"macknairb","8","48","119","13 August 2018"," Well presented
","Contrary to some of you who are saying Spike Lee was presenting his political beliefs, the view he presented is the world in which African American people of had to tolerate in the United States for years. This was not a political statement, this was a movie on reality. The reality is even to this day coloured people and immigrants are still putting up with significant intolerance. There is only one way to get the rest of the North America to understand what their own world is really like and that is to make you feel uncomfortable."

","I was expecting something good when I decided to regard this film. The plot is really appealing but the movie is so slow and doesn't develop in an compelling way.<br/><br/>I enjoy Adam Driver's acting so much. He's the highlight of the movie in my opinion. But John David Washington felt flat for me. His character was boring and the actor didn't have enough charisma to make it better.<br/><br/>I didn't feel like there was something at risk most of the time. I have watched some reviews that said they invented much stuff of the real events. I wish they added some action to make it more interesting.<br/><br/>I'm giving it some starts for Adam Driver and the scene where he is almost interrogated about being Jewish. That's the best scene in the entire movie."

","This is an enjoyable movie but not a ""great"" movie and if 2018 was not a weak film year, it would not have gotten an Oscar nomination for best picture.

Adam Driver did a good job, but his role was not that difficult, so i dont get why was he nominated for Oscar, as for the other characters everyone did a decent job, not more.
Some frames were shot perfectly and some others i felt like the director is just showing, and wanted to do something new just to be creative, but actually was unnecessary and a normal shot could have been a better choice.

"cinemawithcj","8","10","19","1 December 2018"," BlacKkKlansman - Cinema with CJ Review
","BlacKkKlansman is Spike Lee spouting more of that fo' real, fo' real sh- and I dig.<br/><br/>I dig real hard.<br/><br/>A few slices from perfection, but still all in on all the things that still matter. It's pretty well worn the comments on how the film is perfectly timed and a wonderful snap back at the real state of the union, but in its real construction...That's what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>For all the Trump parallels, the commentary on racism on all levels, the evolving but still problematic nature of police investigation, to all the other themes that stick and resonate so hard, especially in those last five minutes...Spike Lee reminds you once again why he teaches on the subject of film. He constructs a damn fine one.<br/><br/>There's a sequence near the beginning that alone shows the power of powerful dialogue, strong direction, purposeful cinematography, and masterful editing. Then you get that throughout the rest of the film. BlacKkKlansman speaks through the medium of cinema in how calculated and important each cut is, and it speaks through Cinema itself. Hell, it opens with film footage that already throws in a reversal and then uses film further in many scenes following to play off the heroics of ""white"" cinema and ""black"" Cinema. Juxtaposition is alive and well in BlacKkKlansman and sometimes the simplest technique is the most powerful.<br/><br/>We see how two worlds are so different through their similarities, and context truly plants where the line in the sand is. Lee has created another film to shine a light on how f-ed things are and some people are, and that times haven't really changed and that all lives matter. There are still some misjudged violent wrong people in the world and they haven't stopped yet. But Spike Lee has made another flick that can be put in cinemas and show us - because that's where we go to see our heroes - that there's good people fighting the good fight, and infiltrate hate.<br/><br/>Because this film points out pretty easily...that hate is stupid."
"kluseba","9","10","19","20 November 2018"," Speak and stand up for civil rights
","Based upon true events, BlacKkKlansman tells the story of Colorado Springs' first African American police officer who spontaneously calls the local Ku Klux Klan branch and pretends to be interested in joining the group. The white supremacist group falls for his trick and members of the local branch propose to meet him in person. The African American police officer teams up with a Jewish coworker who inflitrates the group in his own stead. As civil rights activists become unsettled in the city and clash with the local Ku Klux Klan branch that prepares for their Grand Wizard's visit, the two police officers must keep the population save and prevent a dangerous bomb plot.<br/><br/>The movie convinces for numerous reasons. First of all, it's based upon true events yet tells a very improbable story. Secondly, the characters are authentic, diversified and intriguing. Thirdly, the actresses and actors did expert jobs and play their roles with conviction, energy and wit. Fourthly, the films truly reincarnates the spirit of the early seventies in the way people were dressed and talked but it also respects cultural and political circumstances that give the film the vibe of a documentary at times. Fifthly, the film doesn't only include documentary segments but is also an adventurous mixture of a tense crime film and an emotive drama. Sixthly, even though the movie has a clear message, it isn't too judgemental and shows that some civil rights activists are as radical as their opponents. Seventhly, the film has a strong message: racism isn't acceptable under any circumstances. Eighthly, the film has a connection to the present, showing how civil rights activists still get attacked by white supremacists in present-day United States of America while the President of the United States of America fails to address the issue properly and attempt to solve it. Ninethly, the movie is filmed with care in form of calm and precise camera work and a lack of special effects to give it a more authentic vibe.<br/><br/>You can watch BlackKklansman for many reasons. It certainly portrays an intriguing if horrifying part of the history of the United States of America. It's a gripping drama with credible characters. It's a thriller that becomes more and more intense and literally ends with a bang. Most importantly however, this movie makes you think about civil rights and racism in the United States of America. Even though the overall situation has improved since the early seventies when the movie takes place, some issues have always remained present and have even become more critical over the past few years. BlacKkKlansman shows what the United States of America really are: a divided country torn between progression and regression. With its intense epilogue that offers a clear statement after the main part of the movie was mostly neutral, BlacKkKlansman invites to speak and stand up for civil rights. If you're a true American, this is what you ought to do. If you're not, take the film as a dynamic mixture between entertainment and lesson that offers some food for thought."

","BlacKkKlansman (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>BlacKKKlansman is a biographical drama film that is a crazy true story about a first African American detective in Colorado police department. Were he goes undercover to a KKK clan after having conversations with them over the phone. He enlists one of the detectives to go undercover for them to help expose their future attacks.<br/><br/>The plot tries to be fun and have a powerful story over real events on what happened. John David Washington playing Ron Stallworth, the first African American detective. Who was bored working in the records room in the department and his chief transferred him to being a detective. He sees an ad for a KKK clan on the newspaper and decides to call them wanting to be recruited. He sends another detective Flip (Adam Driver) to pretend to be Ron Stallworth when he is going undercover for the clan. It was fun seeing Adam Driver and John David Washington performance together as they practice to be the other person. And Driver being conflicted on joining the clan cause of his dislike how they treat people and he is apparently Jewish which he knows nothing about except for his family.<br/><br/>The performances were great with the two leads. Laura Harrier was great playing Patrice who falls for Ron. Topher Grace playing the arrogant David Duke who is a KKK leader.<br/><br/>Spike Lee did give a powerful direction. He tries to have some fun with the material while taking it very serious with delivering the true events. The films setting was in the 1970s and his direction tries to be that 1970s film. Sadly, I think the music score felt a little out of place at times. During dramatic car chase with the leads trying to stop a bomb the music during the movie felt indifferent. The music score could have been better. Even, the ending sequence with Ron and Patrice walking in the hallway with the hazing direction and music playing was similar to Spike Lee's previous films Inside Man. Could have been creative with the music choices.<br/><br/>Overall, Blackkklansman is a good film. The acting was great. The story was powerful. Even the movie referring back to 2017's August events in Charleston was mentioned."

","This movie is about to be a massive explosion in the film-moking world, of social relations and politics.
It's a film made bi Spike Lee who made "" Do The Right Thing "" in 1989, which was already very much devoted to the African-American cause.
Based on the true story Ron Stallworth who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in 1979 with the help of the Colorado Springs Police Department.
There's also a good cast with notable actors such as John David Washington ( Denzel's son ), Adam Driver ( who played Kylo Ren ), Laura Harrier, Corey Hawkins, Michael Buscemi, Topher Grace and even Alec Baldwin.
They're all doing a great acting job, and make the movie more emotional.
This movie perfectly describe how rough the climate between balck and white people was in the 70's US society, and how it hasn't really changed nowadays.
Sometimes, it's funny, sometimes it's appalling but, most of all, it's very convincing.
In today's life in the United States, people are living the same tensions during the Civil Rights riots in the 50's and 60's, extremism is upcoming, people die for their opinions and a huge wave of violence divide the country in different parts.
The last film shots leave you in shock, flabberfasted, struck and also scared about what the hell is going wrong in this country.
I hope that it'll have an impact on the neo-Nazi/white supremacist camp, and make them think if they are really fighting for a great cause or just spread hate, racism and division towards peaceful members of the Black Lives Matter movement."

He uses his ""white voice"" to talk to the Klan on the phone, eventually meeting with David Duke (Topher Grace) himself.<br/><br/>It was based on a true story with most likely fake dialogue for drama.

"thirstydog-32613","8","12","24","2 September 2018"," Very Good
","It's been a couple of weeks since I've seen this, and the thing that sticks in my mind after all that time is that it reminds me a little bit of a Quentin Tarantino film, though not as gleeful in its portrayal of violence. That by no means is a bad thing. <br/><br/>The film has a stylized feeling, it doesn't feel quite realistic, like a Tarantino film. For example in the way the main character spoke. I know that half the time he is trying to sound white, but even when he isn't pretending to be a white man, he had this annoying nasally white voice when he was being himself. Something about that struck me as not quite right. <br/><br/>It is a humorous film, but the humor seemed stylized - not quite natural. Again, it reminded me of Tarantino film in that way. Characters were archetypes. We have The dumb fat, but viscous racist who at first sight seems harmless. The smart, even more viscous racists who is very menacing. Then you have the white naive (or is he?) Klan leader, who plays the straight guy for all the gags. Very little goes into what makes these characters tick. Even the good guys' characters are not very well developed.<br/><br/>The film also kind of hits the viewer over the head with it's message, though it is an important one indeed. For the most part, police stations are integrated now. For the most part, people understand that the KKK are bad. Modern day race problems seem to be more intricate than those presented here. Even the closing, in which Lee ties in his move with current events, is kind of obvious. But it is beautifully done with a match cut that starts with a Klan rally and switches to the Alt-right rally in Virginia. it shows that maybe we shouldn't take those obvious problems I just mentioned above for granted.<br/><br/>I don't mind the stylized manner of this film and I even quite enjoyed it. This film is better than any Tarantino film, but I think the flaws I mention above keep the film from being a master piece. ""Do the Right Thing"" was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>A better film on race relations that is released about the same time as this one is ""Blindspotting"" - my favorite film of the summer so far. Be sure to check that one out, if you liked this."

","When I first heard of the premise of the movie, I thought something many thought I guess: That's a joke and not really a movie. And I and some others who have seen the Dave Chappelle Show were also thinking about the sketch/skit he did on that show. A black man becoming a member of the Klan? I mean come on, that didn't really happen now did it? It did? Now that should have woken up your interest.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the Klan (and no you are not amongst very fine people no matter what the current Potus says), I'm guessing you feel anger when hearing this. Normally one should feel shame, but I doubt Klan fans will. If you do though it means, you may be on the right track and should reconsider ... you don't want to be associated with them.<br/><br/>But back to the movie or rather the real life story. It may be heightened at places, but overall it does feel real. It's also quite funny for a serious matter like this. Which makes the ending even harder to swallow. It's not really a spoiler, though I won't say what I mean and if one is technical the punch to the gut comes from something that is ""removed"" from the main story, yet very much connected. If that does not touch you ... Spike Lee was very vocal when the movie was released and talks about Agent Orange. Whatever you think of that, this movie is essential"

","Mid-1970s. Ron Stallworth joins the Colorado Springs Police Department, becoming its first African-American officer. After a while he becomes a detective. Then he infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>Great movie, directed by Spike Lee. The main part of the story - African-American detective infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan - seems preposterous but is true, being based on Ron Stallworth's book. Spike Lee uses the absurdity of this event to great effect, with many situations that are quite hilarious. The movie could easily have just been a comedy, as Lee keeps the humour coming, and doesn't just rely on the central plot for that.<br/><br/>However, it's far more than a comedy. As a cop-drama it is very interesting too, with an intriguing crime angle and some gripping developments. The conclusion to this feels a bit trite and Hollywoodized, however: in reality Stallworth's investigation did not end so dramatically, or so poetically in its justice.<br/><br/>The social commentary aspect is also, for the most part, well done. The African-American experience is well shown. With regard to the KKK, Lee could easily have drawn the KKK members as one-dimensional, redneck, cartoon-character stereotypes but does a great job at humanising them, plus showing the different types within the KKK: from the stupid and easily lead, to the violent, nothing-is-beyond-them types to the cunning leaders, for whom spreading hate is an industry and a career. Moreover, it's fairly well balanced: Lee doesn't create a black vs white rhetoric but shows that it is racist pockets within society that are to blame.<br/><br/>However, some of the shine does get taken off this objectivity at the end, with Lee trying to draw parallels with current events, and taking aim at current political leaders. While showing that racism and organisations like the KKK still exist and need to be eradicated is a pertinent message, the way it was presented just felt cheap."
"Nathan_Needs_A_Username","9","6","10","6 April 2019"," Movie Review: BlacKkKlansman
","The conversation around this film inevitably ends up at the closing few minuets. to get it out of the way I think the way this film wraps up was certainly a bold choice on Lees part that helps ground he movie in todays political climate and draws parallels between the struggles of the of the 70s and the struggles of today. This will alienate a lot of potential audience members but it is a Spike Lee film so you should know what you are in for.<br/><br/>The film proceeding the controversial short documentary is actually one of the most entertaining films I have seen all year and certainly isnt shy about tackling political and social issues head on. At times it can be tough to believe that this is a completely true story as the screenplay elegantly glides from one insane encounter to the next without ever flinching. As far as I can tell with my limited research this is a largely accurate retelling of the story and if that is the case then screenwriters Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott and director Spike Lee landed on a perfect story for Lees unique style. The influence of black cinema from the 70s is felt everywhere from the cinematography to the music gives the film a feeling of cool that not many modern films pull of.<br/><br/>If BlacKkKlansman is not up for at least one acting Oscar then I might just have to give up on trying to predict Oscar nominees. Adam Driver is the best he has ever been in a non Star Wars project, Topher Grace delivers an unsettlingly charming and perfectly threatening performance as Grand Wizard David Duke and John David Washington breaks out of his fathers shadow within seconds of screen time.<br/><br/>BlacKkKlansman is absolutely going to rank high on my best of the year list this year! this is a film that has to be seen."

"user2902","9","6","10","1 December 2018"," Hats off to Spike Lee
","Some of the reviews foud this movie appalling, I found it eye-opening. Some people found it biased, I found it daring.
This film, which is directed by Spike Lee, is based on a book after a true story ; the story of Ron Stallworth (performed by John D. Washington, whose performance is absolutely inspiring), first black police officer in Colorado Springs, Colorado. To be able to enter the Intelligence Services, or lead character is going to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan's local chapter. There will be other characters, who will help him throughout the film, such as Flip (Adam Driver), the Jewish policeman, or Patrice (Laura Harrier), the Black Panther activist.
In my opinion, this film is an absolute must-see! As I said, the actor's performances (not only John D. Wasington's) are very convincing, and they are supported by a screenplay that manages to be both funny and thought-provoking at times.
I did find the movie a bit long at times, though. However, it does not keep the audience from understanding the numerous (and very up-to-date) inequalities this film is about : racism (obviously), anti-Semitism, gender inequalities,...
Last but not least, the Charlottesville scene at the end. Many people found it upsetting, since it doesn't have any direct ties with Stallworth's story. But since these subjects are still so present in America nowadays, I find it legit, and it's a perfect conclusion for a masterpiece such as BlacKkKlansman.
Just to finish with a few words about the film's direction : it feels like such a true to life 70's city! It is striking!
Hats off, Mr Lee, you did a great job there!"
"andrewroy-04316","8","6","10","11 November 2018"," An overtly political movie that is in equal parts thrilling and thought-provoking
","Blackkklansman is unambiguous about its social message, but delivers it through a drama where the stakes continue to raise throughout the movie. While it may have been a little too on the nose about its emphasis throughout, I loved the way Lee tied the film events back to present day at the end. The arc of the movie was very well done - what's a small phone call at first spirals deeper and deeper into thrilling, high-drama situations. The tension was truly at its peak during the dinner and road sequences, a great culmination of the investment the undercover officers put into their bold investigation. Adam Driver clearly had the performance of the movie for me - despite a very subdued performance, he manages to inject thought and emotion into several scenes and does a great job in his undercover scenes. The humor didn't land as much for me as for others - most of the jokes were just plays on a black guy calling David Duke and acting like a white guy, which lost its amusement after the first couple calls for me. The romance between Ron and Patrice felt very forced and their conversations just didn't hold any interest, as Patrice felt more extreme than needed and Ron was very obvious about being a cop and not just saying he supports the cause. The frustration between them felt unnecessary. It was also a bit jarring to watch the juxtaposition of the extreme nature of the KKK's hatred with Ron and the black power movement, though that is intentional and central to the film. A few minor scenes felt a bit overly scripted or dramatized, particularly Ron being assigned to be Duke's security detail (why would they actually give him that assignment), Ron grabbing their shoulders in the picture (why would he do that?), and Felix knowing about Ron's identity but subtly bringing it into a conversation rather than telling Duke what's going on, and then Felix being called out of the room just as he's bringing it up. For all its criticisms of heavy-handedness, this is a topic that should be handled with extremity and no ambiguity, so Lee's demonstration of racism within the context of an exciting movie that's also a crazy true story is a testament to his success as a director."

","Movies about the darkest parts of history are difficult to pull off. In the era of Trump, Hollywood has started to focus on race and politics more than ever, with the likes of Get Out, The Purge, The Death of Stalin, Detroit and so on. BlacKkKlansman, Spike Lee's latest 'joint' (his stylised possessory credit), explores messages, social commentary, themes and ideas as deep as possible. Not a second is wasted on what it's trying to say, while its engrossing storyline is told with sweeping energy, creative freedom and emotion. I haven't seen race and racism displayed so effectively in cinema for a very long time.<br/><br/>The movie centres around the true story on the racist troubles of Ku Klux Klan during the 1970's. The police service of Coronado Springs attempts to take them down with the help of a young African-American named Ron Stallworth, the first in the department.<br/><br/>Punctured by a smart screenplay by David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, Charlie Wachtel and Lee, Lee's approach to the event clearly shows his vision wasn't interfered by an uncompromising bankable studio. Cinematographer Chayse Irvin wisely chose to shoot on 35mm and 16mm film, creating a serious old-school 70's vibe where at times characters are slightly out of focus and the sunlight is overexposed due to the sensitivity of the film stock. Wes Anderson-like techniques are frequently present here, with closeups of images that fill the screen, quick pans, dolly shots that go from character to character (especially in one scene) and a few beautiful dreamlike shots that unintentionally pay homage to Bohemian Rhapsody. This is what sets the film apart from others, adding a scoop of creative juice within the storytelling.<br/><br/>John David Washington's first acting role, son of Denzil, is a knockout. He really digs deep into the psychology of Stallworth and nails it onscreen. In his big break from playing Kylo Ren between 2017's The Last Jedi and Episode IX in 2019, Adam Driver puts on another great performance as Flip Zimmerman, with his laid back presence lighting up every scene he's in. Topher Grace's career has officially been revived with this movie after going out of the spotlight since Spider-Man 3. He somehow fits into the role of David Duke with his talent to be serious and ends up being taken as comedic.<br/><br/>There are a few fizzles along the way. Lee's ability to occasionally break the 180-degree rule for effect and use multiple shots on a single action can come across as jarring. Sometimes Barry Alexander Brown's editing from scene-to-scene are blink-and-you'll-miss-it transitions, jumping to the next stage way too fast.<br/><br/>Besides these issues, the whole thing flows pretty well. I don't think we'll seeing anything as satisfying as this in a very long time. One of the best films of 2018."
"jordanmcnaught","9","6","10","1 September 2018"," Shocking and Beautiful
","This movie is great at what it sets out to do: provide a comedic, interesting story on a black man infiltrating the KKK, while also providing a strong message saying that some of this hate we've seen throughout the movie isn't gone yet. 
While I do think this movie has a few pacing issues around the middle of the film, the denouement and ending are both fantastic, and are well worth sitting through some dragging scenes. John David Washington is fantastic in this movie, and also Adam Driver. Driver plays a character who is trying to play a character of someone that would support the KKK, and this is just another great performance on his growing resume of acting. 
Like I've said before, the ending is amazing, and I won't spoil it for you, but you could hear a pin drop when the credits rolled in my screening. And I believe that is one of the most important jobs of filmmakers: to make the audience feel emotion, and to convey their point. There are not many films I can think of that could do that to this high a standard. <br/><br/>Overall, fantastic film, best of the year so far in my opinion, and no matter who you are, you need to see this film!"

"leandrieu","9","19","42","2 December 2018"," Gripping story, from the beginning to the end...
","BlacKkKlansman is a movie directed by Spike Lee. It is actually based on a surprising true story : a black police officer managed to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organisation. It happened in the late 1970s. The film combines comedy, drama and romance, and in a great way.
The plot is very well constructed and that's why it's so gripping. I couldn't find any mistakes in the plot and the characters are all interesting. I don't want to reveal too much because you must see the movie, but I can say some characters are really moving and striking by their personality traits. It is obvious the cast is excellent : most of the actor's game is true to life and convincing.
What I like most in this movie is the relation made between the past and now. The last scene is powerful and upsetting. It is disturbing to take reality like a punch in the face but it made me, and I think all viewers, more conscious about discrimination and racism. It is a must-see because it is about the world we are linving in now.
What's more, I absolutely loved the confrontation between the Black Panthers, which is an organisation of black peolple thinking only violence can solve problems, and the Ku Klux Klan in some scenes. The setting are perfect.

","A film is a visually, sonically, and soulfully inspiring work of art. A film brings life to forgotten stories and personal dreams. The stories contained within are emotional and opinionated. Often, subtleness is laid to the wayside and films polarize the audience. BlackKklansman deals in such a discussion of race tensions in America.<br/><br/>Let me be clear, my opinion of BlackKklansman stems solely from its effectiveness in emotional elicitation. I entered the theatre and left my politics at the door. As a result, I enjoyed a riveting ride through 1970s Colorado Springs. The color pallette glowed and mirrored the colors of the New Black Panther Party: black, red, gold, and green. Cinematographer Chayse Irvin delivered a natural, through-the-window view of the HATE that existed in 1970s America. Let me correct myself. That same HATE still lives today. The cast sells the story well. Alec Baldwin, John David Washington, Adam Driver, and Topher Grace live, breathe and embody the driving elements behind their respective characters. I entered the theatre devoid of all preconceptions and returned to the parking lot with a spinning mind. What BlackKklansman best succeeds in is offering a hero arguably different than the viewer and making him feel like a brother. Lee does this by highlighting kinship and eternal brotherhood among man, woman, and race. Sadly, the curtain comes crashing down and the final still of the movie destroys what good it had done. I cannot and will not spoil that for you. Know this, if you want to tell a story about overcoming differences, do not polarize the audience again as soon as they are about to leave the theatre."

John David Washington and Adam Driver deliver stellar and riveting performances to each of their characters, the chemistry between these two is truly a spectacle to watch. The plot mixes between comedy and drama but do not believe that the dark themes are overshadowed by the well written screenplay, there are definitely some very serious moments, especially during the end of the film where they show actual events happening today reminding us that humanity hasn't changed in the slightest. The cinematography done in the film was greatly executed, you can tell each scene was carefully shot and tells you that this was obviously not a cash-grab because of it's theme and heavy subject although it is presented in a lighthearted manner, you can see that this was a passion project with Spike Lee wanting to deliver a reminder of how today's world isn't so different to how it was back then. My only gropes with this film is that it tends to drag scenes longer than it should making it a little bit long and at times kind of boring, and it also has a theme that was pretty nice the first few times it played until you realize it keeps playing throughout the entire thing, it got really annoying. Overall, great directing, performances, camerawork and fresh storytelling."

","What blows me away the most about BlacKkKlansman was its ability to profitably blend such a serious and calamitous subject with an appropriate amount of comedy. Only a long-in-the-business, cinematic master like Spike Lee could pull off such a trick, and he does it without complication. It's also refreshing to see that Spike Lee avoids stereotypes even when depicting some of the more unpleasant and nefarious characters/groups, allowing the film to feel less biased and more grounded in reality with various angles interweaving. BlacKkKlansman contains one of the most hard-hitting, politically dynamic screenplays (right next to Blindspotting) of the year that had me infatuated with revelation. It certainly is one of Spike Lee's best joints in years, maybe even decades. (Verdict: A-)"
"Zakliz477","9","23","53","12 August 2018"," A Compulsivly Watchable Future Classic
","Spike Lee remains one of the most interesting American directors working at this moment, regardless of the varying quality of his work as of late, it's immediately apparent with any of his projects that even in his early 60s he remains just as eager to experiment and indulge as he was when he got out of film school. Even his outright bad films contain so much cinematic flair and so many flat out ballsy choices, that they are worth watching. BlacKkKlansman, his best film of late, bounces with so much energy that it's easy to forget how much of the runtime is given to discussion, how much is dedicated for varying parties to reveal their view points and logic. Its a film which bounces effortlessly between black comedy and police procedural, which is filled equally with gut busting wit and sweat inducing suspense, and most importantly which never skimps on entertainment. But Lee is always aware that his film is first and foremost a vehicle to deliver social commentary, and he ends the film on a left field gut punch the likes of which haven't been seen since Do the Right Thing. After 2 hours of laughter and a good time, the final frames of this film left me speechless in a way that few films have, and crystallize the films message in the boldest terms imaginable. Many people will hate this film because of its politics, because it states things that are frankly uncomfortable to think about, but the message is supported by top knotch craftsmanship, the filmmaking on display is inspired to say the least, and it feels like Lee is again filled with the same infectious energy which made him a legend 30 years ago."

","Movie BlacKkKlansman directed by Spike Lee focuses on more than 5 decades old happenings involving David Duke ( played very well by Topher Grace of the 70s show) and a whole group of whites. But what makes movie interesting is the exuberance and style of Ron Stallworth (extremely well done by John David Washington , son of Denzel Washington ). Ron is a black man and has confidence and sincerity of any hardworking , intelligent human. Ron can talk like a white American and can also talk like a Black americian from ghetto. Adam Driver as Flip Zimmerman is extremely good as a born Jew who has never really focused on his religion and always behaved like a white American. Ron is voice of a whiteman and Flip is face of white man Ron. The movie is hilarious. Movie BlacKkKlansman has humor of a Quentin Tarantino directed movie Django Unchained. The issue of race is sad and it is really nice to give a twist to racial differences . Even Chief Bridges (actor Robert John Burke) was very sincere in his talks to Ron Stallworth .

","I recently saw the new Spike Lee movie BlacKkKlansman, and I'm happy to say it was a great experience watching it. I was somewhat nervous going into the movie due to the fact that most of Spike's other movies were underwhelming to me. I'm happy to say that BlacKkKlansman breaks that trend.<br/><br/>One aspect I never found Spike Lee to be great at is Shot Composition. Even in his movies that I like ( He Got Game, Do The Right Thing), The cinematography seemed very uninspired to me. For BlacKkKlansman the cinematography had to be better because of the time when the movie was set in. After viewing I can confidently say that I really enjoyed the majority of the shots in the movie. The shot were John David Washington's character is in a room were a speech is being given and the camera zooms in on the people's faces and creates a really compelling shot. I also really enjoyed the scene where two people are having a conversation and the shot is split into two dutch angles, and I also loved the shot were two main characters are walking down a hallway a the shot zooms in to them in a way that really emphasizes the tone of the scene. All of these do a great job a helping us believe the time of the movie and is very reminiscent of the Black Exploitation movies that very clearly inspired it.<br/><br/>The acting was great, John David Washington does a phenomenal job as the main character. Adam Driver also provided a great performance and had great chemistry with Washington which was essential to the success of the film. All of the members of KKK gave great performances, Especially Jasper Paakkonen who's role had the potential to be very cringy.<br/><br/>The story of the movie was pretty good for the most part. One gripe I would have is that there is a break in between the end of the second act of the movie and the third act which moved very slowly and was especially annoying because I could clearly tell where the film was going. With that said the final act of the movie is great and the tension is very palpable even for who knew how it ended before hand. The way the movie leaves little clues that come into the third act later is really rewarding for people that pay close attention.<br/><br/>Now for the elephant in the room, what do I think about the messaging in the movie. I'm not going to complain about the movie being preachy because it is very clearly trying to have a message. I was big fan of when the movie pulled very sneaky messages were they make parallel to today in a very clever way, the way that you have to catch the messages yourself makes the movie far more engaging. For the sake of spoilers i'm not going to go into to detail on any of them. The only complaint I have is when it comes to criticizing Trump the movie throws the nuance out the window for painfully obvious lines that are cringy enough that I half expected the characters to wink at the screen. It always annoyed when musicians, filmmakers and other forms of media bash Trump in such a dumb and lowest common denominater way as if to not go over anyone's head. Thankfully there weren't many examples of this.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think that BlacKkKlansman was a great movie that is very poignant for today. Spike Lee really returns to form and I would say this is his best movie yet. I would highly recommend for everyone to see it<br/><br/>Score: 8/10"

","Perfect example of truth being stranger than fiction. He used his real name to apply for membership in the KKK. How was that possible?

Things are worst now, since racism isn't compelled to hide it's face. When the movie ended, it was eerily quiet. The truth was uncomfortable and disgusting. People got up and left silently without comment. It was a lot to think about. I'm still thinking about it. Thinking about seeing it again.

"Dan1863Sickles","8","11","22","29 August 2018"," Spike Lee's Best Movie Since BAMBOOZLED -- Maybe His Best Ever!
","I've never been a fan of Spike Lee's movies, not because I disagree with his angry views but because as works of entertainment his pictures always impressed me as being profoundly mediocre. With a few notable exceptions, (such as the superb cultural study BAMBOOZLED), a typical Spike Lee Joint is shrill, preachy, and one-dimensional, with flat characters, forced comic situations, a lot of lecturing and very little action. <br/><br/>But this movie is different. This powerful, action packed police drama made me totally rethink the limits of Spike Lee's talent. <br/><br/>For the first time in his career, Spike shows subtlety and restraint. He allows the characters to live and grow on screen, instead of just shouting at each other. He allows the story to make the points he wants to make, instead of just stopping the action so the characters can lecture the audience. <br/><br/>The power of this movie comes from the fact that the storytelling is very quiet, almost low-key. When the black cop calls up the Klan and tries to enroll, at first it seems like a prank. But soon it becomes very serious. And when the Jewish cop has to step in as the ""double"" of the invisible Klan recruit, you can feel the tension building just in the way Flip Zimmerman becomes better and better at playing a racist white man who hates Jews. John David Washington is a classic leading man, but Adam Diver really steals the show as the complex and conflicted Zimmerman. This is the first Spike Lee movie I've ever seen where a white man is something other than a menace or a buffoon. (""But black men are portrayed that way all the time!"" I know, Spike. I know.)<br/><br/>It was so obvious that this time out Spike was working with better camera people, better film editors, and a better composer to write the haunting musical score. As the cops, black radicals, and Klansmen rushed headlong to their final showdown, with a literal ticking bomb to provide suspense, I didn't feel like I was being preached to or bullied. I felt like I was caught up in the story . . . caught up in the action. And I didn't want the story to end. <br/><br/>This isn't a perfect movie, of course. There were some awkward moments, some characters that didn't work out. Young Corey Hawkins effortlessly delivers the goods as a fiery orator, while an aging Harry Belafonte struggles to project emotion as he recounts a lynching from decades ago. It's also interesting that Spike Lee has moved on from challenging the Jewish and Italian racists in his own beloved NYC, in movies like DO THE RIGHT THING, and is now more interested in a can't-miss attack on a culturally acceptable basket of ignorant hillbilly stereotypes. On the one hand, I appreciated the subtlety of naming one of the Klansmen ""Ivanhoe."" (Sir Walter Scott's white fantasy of European chivalry set the pattern for the all-white escapism of J.R.R. Tolkien and George Martin alike.) On the other hand, setting up the mean Klansman's fat and ugly wife to be the ultimate villain in the film panders to a whole lot of prejudices that have nothing to do with racism. <br/><br/>It's no accident that the ridiculously mannered Anthony Lane at the NEW YORKER sneered at the evil Klan wife in his review as a ""doofus."" To a bejeweled dowager like Anthony Lane, all poor white people are ridiculous and contemptible. Lane is so eager to flaunt his class privilege that he's even willing to pretend to admire Spike Lee. And Spike is happy to flatter his upper-class prejudices in order to get his story told. It's a beautifully symbiotic relationship. But the snobbery and hypocrisy of the liberal elite only intensifies the appeal of Donald Trump . . . or the Ku Klux Klan. Spike Lee can't be expected to solve this problem, but sooner or later the liberal elite will have to confront it. There will always be poor whites who resent minorities, but ninnies like Anthony Lane and magazines like the NEW YORKER aren't part of the solution . . . they're part of the problem."

"Bertaut","8","21","48","4 September 2018"," Polemical, didactic, confrontational, angry, trenchant - a state-of-the-nation address
","BlacKkKlansman is a film with a lot on its mind. It opens with one of the most (in)famous scenes from <a href=""/title/tt0031381/"">Gone with the Wind (1939)</a>, before pivoting to a fictional precursor of <a href=""/name/nm1093953/"">Alex Jones</a> lecturing the audience on the dangers of the ""negroid"", and later takes in everything from Kwame Ture to David Duke, before lambasting <a href=""/title/tt0004972/"">The Birth of a Nation (1915)</a>, criticising the tropes of classic Blaxploitation films, going into agonising detail regarding the 1916 lynching of Jesse Washington, sardonically criticising police bureaucracy, and concluding with a montage of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, intercut with Duke championing Donald Trump's presidency, and Trump's own reluctance to condemn the white supremacist component of the rally. The film then ends with an upside-down black and white American flag (a symbol for ""dire distress""). Yep; this is a film with a lot to say.<br/><br/>Telling the story of Rob Stallworthy (<a href=""/name/nm0913475/"">John David Washington</a>), a black police officer in Colorado Springs who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in 1979, at its core, BlacKkKlansman is about institutional racism in the United States. Ostensibly dealing with the 1970s manifestation of such, the film's real point is that in 2018, not only is such racism still a problem, it's now even more endemic, due to its pseudo-legitimacy in the wake of Trump's election, and the concomitant upsurge in hate crime across the country.<br/><br/>Co-writer/director <a href=""/name/nm0000490/"">Spike Lee</a>'s combative intent is signalled in the first scene, which is actually a scene from Gone with the Wind; Scarlett O'Hara wandering through the thousands of wounded and dead Confederate soldiers after the Battle of Atlanta, as a crane shot pulls back to show the devastation, finally coming to rest on a tattered Confederate Navy Jack. The implication is clear - this is very much the world of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, the belief that prior to Reconstruction, the Antebellum South was an urbane and benign society, with the Confederacy heroically fighting the corrupt Union so as to preserve the inherently honourable southern way of life.<br/><br/>Lee keeps up the confrontational tack in the film's second scene, which depicts the fictional cultural anthropologist Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard (<a href=""/name/nm0000285/"">Alec Baldwin</a>), who, in grainy black-and-white footage tries to alert the audience to the fact that the negorids are attempting to take over the country. What's especially well done here is how Lee uses <a href=""/name/nm0000428/"">D.W. Griffith</a>'s The Birth of a Nation. As footage plays behind Beauregard, his face is erased of its colour - he is literally rendered white enough to become part of the image, which depicts a narrative built around the inherently virtuous nature of being white. It's a powerful shot that clearly tells us, yes, this is a comedy, and yes, these people are ridiculous, but also alerting us to the fact that Lee is not playing around here.<br/><br/>But what is Lee's point? The cultural instability of the United States in 2018, with its entrenched institutional racism, an entire race of people once again being treated like second class citizens because of the amount of melanin in their skin, hateful rhetoric masquerading as national pride, the breakdown of the distinction between xenophobia and patriotism, and the transition of hate crimes from the fringes of society into the realm of social acceptability. The film suggests that organisational racism once existed half-way between the absurd and the dangerous, but in recent years, it has moved in the wrong direction. Even before we get to the chilling closing montage, Lee and his co-writers (<a href=""/name/nm4478735/"">Charlie Wachtel</a>, <a href=""/name/nm5161275/"">David Rabinowitz</a>, and <a href=""/name/nm0932551/"">Kevin Willmott</a>) have dropped a few subtle allusions to Trump's presidency. In one scene, Stallworth confidently asserts that it doesn't matter how much of a legitimate businessman Duke becomes, and no matter how much he hides his racism behind more patriotic rhetoric such as immigration and crime, the country would never elect a crass, hate-filled racist as president. In another scene, David Duke (<a href=""/name/nm0333410/"">Topher Grace</a>) explains he and the KKK are ""making America great again."" These two allusions would be enough to get the point across, but it would also mean that that point remains in the realm of comedy, and is therefore easily dismissed. The closing montage changes that, as it drops all pretence of humour in depicting what happened in Charlottesville, and Trump's asinine response. This is very much a state-of-the-nation address.<br/><br/>In relation to Birth of a Nation, of course, things are more complicated than they are in relation to Gone with the Wind. Yes, the film is horrifically racist, and yes, it was singlehandedly responsible for the 20th century revival of the KKK, but it is also probably the most important film ever made, and literally wrote the book on screen grammar. Conceivably, Gone with the Wind could be removed from the canon and no longer taught, but Birth absolutely could not. It is a foundational text, an undeniable landmark film, completely independent of its politics. Birth is based on <a href=""/name/nm0228746/"">Thomas Dixon Jr.</a>'s 1905 novel The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan. The second book in his KKK trilogy, the novel valorises the practises and institutions designed to oppress black people, whilst depicting emancipated slaves and Yankee carpetbaggers as the ""real"" villains behind the Civil War, positing that the plight of the freedmen during Reconstruction was a direct result of their liberation (i.e., they (and the south in general) would have been better off had they remained slaves). In Dixon's depiction of the lawless society of the south, created by the Union, where coloureds can walk around freely, southern whites have become the target of racial violence, with freedmen being particularly fond of raping white women. In the trilogy, the Klan are depicted as arising from this maelstrom, honourable and heroic men forced to reluctantly take the law into their own hands so as to stop the rampage. So influential was the film that the modern KKK practices of wearing white hoods and burning crosses come from it, not from the original 1865-1871 incarnation of the Klan.<br/><br/>Lee uses Birth twice - in the Beauregard scene, and in a later scene where his use of it speaks to the formal complexity of his own work. One of the most important of Griffith's innovations was that of parallel editing (better known today as cross-cutting), something we all take for granted in everything from films to commercials to music videos. In a nutshell, parallel editing is when two separate actions from two separate locations are intercut to suggest they are happening simultaneously, often, but not always, to heighten tension. It's one of the most fundamental components of screen grammar, so much so we don't even think about it today - we just take it as given. However, Lee's genius in this scene is that he uses Birth to mock the Klan by way of, you guessed it, parallel editing. As the KKK sit down to watch Birth, Lee intercuts their enjoyment of its absurdities with Jerome Turner (<a href=""/name/nm0000896/"">Harry Belafonte</a>) telling the story of the barbaric lynching of Jesse Washington, which saw a crowd of over 10,000 people in Waco, Texas, cheering on as his testicles and fingers were cut off, after which he was slowly burned to death by being continually raised over a fire. Lee uses parallel editing here so as to have one scene comment on the other - he is literally using Birth's own innovations against it and what it represents. Birth may be politically abhorrent, but Lee is savvy enough to not only recognise its technological importance, but to co-opt that importance and use it for his own ends, showing us the stunned reaction to a vicious murder contrasted with a celebration of the conditions which led to that murder.<br/><br/>As all of this may suggest, yes, the film is preachy, but that's because Lee is preaching. He makes no apology for such. This is polemic filmmaking, and the move into heavy didacticism in the final montage is completely earned.<br/><br/>All of this is not to say the film is perfect, however. For example, how he employs the double dolly shot (which he has used throughout his filmography to suggest characters' inability to control their own actions as they are inexorably pushed forward, divested of the contextualisation of their environment), raises some interesting problems, suggesting, as it does, that orthodox black activism and underground black militancy must combine forces in the face of hate. The film also glosses over Stallworth's time in COINTELPRO, where he worked to sabotage radical black organisations, because this doesn't fit into the overarching theme the film is constructing. Flip Zimmerman (<a href=""/name/nm3485845/"">Adam Driver</a>), Stallworth's partner, who poses as him during face-to-face meetings with the Klan, being Jewish is also problematic (the real person he was based upon is known only as Chuck, and all we know about him is that he definitely wasn't Jewish). Is Zimmerman supposed to represent Republican voters who abhor the KKK as much as the political left do? Who knows, because beyond being Jewish, there's no further character development; he's more of a rhetorical device, a meme rather than a person with an inner life. Similarly, the fictional explosion towards the end of the story serves to distastefully simplify everything, once more making the KKK look foolish, something which is wholly unnecessary at this point in the film, whilst also positing Stallworth as a clichÃ©d movie hero, something Lee has avoided up until this point.<br/><br/>These are relatively minor complaints, however. Look, Lee is far from my favourite filmmaker. I really disliked <a href=""/title/tt0104797/"">Malcolm X (1992)</a>, for example, probably his most celebrated film, and he has justifiably been accused of racism himself on multiple occasions. None of that, however, changes the fact that this is an hilarious, powerful, insightful, and frightening piece of work."

Once this concept of Stallworth on the phone to David Duke so the outward contrasts his ice cold pained eyes to multitude shades of effect, playing out continual vignettes. and two, Adam Driver is the film's conscience with every time his looks mean two things, or he counters his hatred inside for them by projecting forceful racial hate, which I see as pointing to projection as the source of such beliefs. The dual of inside vs outside is one of the most riveting 'double' concepts in film as it brings about several dueling perspectives, which is why we go to the theater. One complained of the half-assed climactic set piece but I think Spike Lee is tired of it all. How can you complain when it begins with 'dis base on sum true shizz'? He is saying these morons don't warrant much serious thought at all, only to laugh at; then re-contextualizes its laxness as tired wisdom with the Charlottesville, VA footage at the end portraying it all deadly serious: the cycles of history are on the verge of repeating and the same stories would go on. 'We didn't want them to be here.' Both sides said the same thing."

Without the made up parts, the movie could've been 20/30 minutes shorter, and better, with better pace between the tense scenes of Adam Driver having to prove he wasn't a cop, and Ron's policial work and discussions by phone with Duke.

","As someone who isn't really familiar with Spike Lee's work, Blackkklansman is a great introduction to his style and makes for a terrific drama brought down only by occasional tonal issues, a lacklustre B plot about Ron Stallworth's love interest that interrupts the flow of the movie, and a few caricaturesque and two-dimensional side characters. Despite the small shortcomings however, Blackkklansman brings some great comedic scenes that never feel forced or awkward and opens up a great dialogue about the current political divide in America while still maintaining a mostly neutral bias to both sides of the political spectrum, even putting emphasis on the Black Panthers and their equally harmful message. The two main leads also deliver amazing performances, primarily Adam Driver who plays the undercover racist amazingly well and brings a compelling presence to every scene he is in.<br/><br/>All in all, Blackkklansman is a highly compelling drama with excellently delivered comedic moments, and a truly powerful message that I believe everyone should experience at least once in the near future."

","Film Review: BlacKkKlansman. Director Spike Lee (""Malcolm X"") returns to the big screen with a current look back at the 1970's emergence of the Ku Kluk Klan. Enter rookie black Colorado Springs cop Ron Stallworth (the charming and self driven John David Washington - son of Denzel Washington), who is brought on to the force because he can talk ""normal"" and ""jive"". When an opportunity to spy on visiting revolutionary Kwame Ture (the empowering Corey Hawkins ""Straight out of Compton), Ron begins his infiltration into the both the black empowerment movement and the Ku Klux Klan, eventually meeting its leader David Duke (portrayed convincing enough by Topher Grace ""That 70's Show""). Linking him to both groups are the strong-fast President of the Movement Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrie """"Spider-Man: Homecoming""), and Klan's men Walter (Ryan Eggold ""New Amsterdam"" TV), wild man Feliz (Jasper Paakkone ""Vikings"" TV), his bubbly wife Connie (the terrific Ashlie Atkinson ""Crashing"" TV), and goof-ball scene stiller Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser "" I, Toyna""). Reluctantly at Ron's side are fellow officers Flip (one of the hardest working actors Adam Driver ""Girls"") and Jimmy (""Blended's"" Michael Buscemi - brother of Steve Buscemi), both who learn a lot from their involvement. While Lee's presentation is a bit stagey throughout, especially the opening informercial by Dr. Beauregard (an out of place Alec Baldwin) and the various floating faces during Ture's speech, it does help to establish the time, place and feel of the 1970's community. As usual, Lee has a lot to say about ""the day"" and today, creatively interjecting current political climate catch phrases like ""Make America Great Again"" to establish his point that we haven't advanced very far as a society. Lee interjects this association at just the right time in the film, making the films final moments coincide with footage from the recent Charlottesville White Nationalist Rally that stuns the viewing audience into silence. If nothing else, the last few minutes of ""BlacKkKlansman"" says it all."

"ElMaruecan82","9","14","30","4 November 2018"," Racism as a convenient zone of psychological comfort... and film-making as a wake-up call...
","As a fan of Spike Lee, I know this review will sound awfully biased, but only to the extent that I'm preoccupied by the way intolerance infected many souls of civilization.<br/><br/>Now, Spike Lee is not a political director but a director who cares for politics to the degree that politics care for people; ever since his ""Do The Right Thing"" in 1989, he never made any secrets about his political inclinations, he sided with Clinton in 1992 less as a democrat than someone who thought Bush would be worse. So any attempt to trap his new ""BlacKkKlansman"" within the 'Liberals vs. Conservatives' realm wouldn't solve the problem but only prove too well that it exists.<br/><br/>The movie is a biopic, not the type to garner Oscar nominations (I do expect one for Best Screenplay though) but a biopic that cares for substance, for ideas rather than being your average crowd-pleaser. The acting never crosses the line of emotionality as Lee doesn't try to bait the Academy but only uses his artistry for a cautionary tale addressed to American (and maybe even European) societies. So, I shouldn't even talk about the Oscars, let's get to the real stuff.<br/><br/>Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is the first Afro-American to join the Colorado Springs Police Department. His first job in the archives makes him realize very quickly that bigotry runs in the Police, for some 'colleagues', it practically gallops given the terms of identifications they use to describe African-Americans. But that's only a foretaste on what's awaiting us, there's more than one racist rant in the film... so sensitive ears are warned.<br/><br/>Still, Lee takes his time before getting to the point as we see Ron dealing first undercover assignment in a Black Panther meeting. Even as a fan , I was afraid the film might sound a bit too preachy for its own good. The speech made by the Black Panther leader, inviting students to love themselves, to accept their identity as black people instead of mimicking or trying to mix with the whites is powerful but visually, it might not be Lee's subtlest work... thankfully, it's not overused.<br/><br/>Washington's acting is more notable in that scene: from his neutral expression, I couldn't tell how he actually felt about Corey Hawkins' speech. This is a man who endures racism on a daily basis but chose to join the Police Force, he looks sincere enough in his approving nods, but not so much to raise his fist and join their enthusiastic ""Black Power"" chant. This is a real masterful portrayal of a character literally sitting on two chairs, and by his own admittance a few scenes later, who must live with two people inside his head.<br/><br/>Now, to get back to Lee's work, the meeting sequence is important for two precise pay-offs: Ron meets female militant Patrice (Laura Harrier) and together they become good friends and have the most interesting conversation (and I don't mean that loosely). And then later when he joins the KKK, we have enough intellectual material to draw parallels between the way Black people picture themselves and the way they're looked at. It is important to have that glimpse before getting to the other side.<br/><br/>Now, I'd rather not get into too much details about Ron infiltrating the KKK, because it's a terrific undercover story with fun novelties. First of all, it's pure curiosity that drove Ron into making contact with the ""Organization"", if even they can print an ad in the newspaper, maybe there's something rotten going on and that is worth making a phone call and see where this leads to. The second novelty is that there are two cops in the mission, it's Adam Driver as Flip Zimmermann who must pass as the ""man behind the voice"": white all right, but Jewish.<br/><br/>Spike Lee has often been accused for his portrayal of Jewish characters (especially ""Mo' Better Blues"") or his vocal concerns about the double standards between Blacks and Jews. But I think that was an unfair trial that gave him bad publicity and stained his reputation, critic Gene Siskel (of Jewish ancestry) considered Lee was in his right to express his own views. Besides, Lee doesn't hierarchize hatreds but shows them as the ends of a same spectrum of hatred meant to last. Indeed, we hear nasty things in the film but not much worse from what we hear in any Internet comments against Blacks, Jews, Gays, Arabs etc.<br/><br/>And Lee exposes an interesting theory connecting the film's context with the rise of racism to a certain presidency today, and that might not content a few supporters. But before one accuses Lee of being some ""liberal midget"", one should also look at the last five minutes of the film and consider the recent tragedy in Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>One more thing, I remember during the Caramail days, I used to register in different identities and have fun feigning being racist toward my own ""kind"" in order to elicit a reaction from the ""other side"". Why it was fun I don't know, maybe because it showed that people are maybe racist to be in a sort of psychological zone of comfort or self-defense machanism, what better than believing that you belong to the right side, after all?<br/><br/>But the film shows the dramatic catch of rubbing people's hearts in the right direction. Spike Lee hasn't just a stance against a political leader but also a certain movie I felt sorry for praising its iconic value: ""The Birth of a Nation"". There's a powerful cameo of Harry Belafonte telling a story of some savage lynching that occurred as a reaction to that movie screening, and it's just reminded (and I'm not making comparisons) of the Twitter reactions against Arabs after the release of ""American Sniper"".<br/><br/>Maybe it says something about the responsibility of Cinema as an Art, and maybe the film was made because Lee felt responsible enough... to remind us that history has a tendency to repeat itself. Let's just hope future proves him wrong!"

These actors desrve more coverage but although does a good job in using their talent he makes a film that's divisive for the wrong reason.<br/><br/>Sadly as seen if you don't review it in a good light you stand the chance to get called a bigot which actually does nothing helpful for the film. Were these times brutal and racist towards people of colour especially African Americans, yes they were and the film shows this to its merit BUT Spike then twists it to push HIS agenda and its not a good one.<br/><br/>You want a master class in this type of film, Mississippi Burning, it pulls no punches, shows the racism for what it was and how it was helped by White America...<br/><br/>But it didn't push an agenda, it was truthful, hard to watch at times and also entertaining, it appealed to a whole audience, Spike Lee targets only who he wants..<br/><br/>Shame, I really like what he does with people and his eye for a story but then he lets his other views be motivation for the film and it alienates it for many.."

Did I mention that I am an old white LADY, as opposed to white MAN? After having one perspective rammed down my throat for over 55 years, I yearned to see Western life from another perspective. Lee gives me that. And here is his genius: without revenge, without anger, without bitterness, this man puts an objective camera out their, and records what happened. Just the ability to do that is remarkable. With his latest film, BlackkKlansman, he gave himself a Herculean challenge; can I depict this situation without any cultural slant. My tears attest that he did so, in spades. From the protagonists relationship with his white superior officer, to his conduct throughout... Lee never tilted the odds to be any different than if the protagonist/superior officer relationship were any different to that of a Bruce Willis in relationship to any similar situation. There was no cultural or racial bias even hinted at. The entire script allowed anyone from any background to experience the story from the drivers seat. The view of racial hatred he provided was so objective and so clear that anyone who was not moved, needs serious psycho therapy. Thank you again Mr. Lee for providing a perfect depiction of truth."

","BlacKkKlansman centers around the true story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American police officer who successfully infiltrated and exposed a Colorado chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970's. John David Washington and Adam Driver (who portray Ron and his partner) both deliver exceptional performances as officers who must navigate the hatred and cruelty of the Klan first-hand. Directed by Spike Lee, the film also deserves praise for its ability to balance several genres and shifting tones - from gritty drama to black comedy (and even a bit of Blaxploitation thrown in for good measure).<br/><br/>We're almost 40 years removed from the actual events of BlacKkKlansman, yet the film is possible more politically relevant today - and the screenwriters are intent to make sure you realize that. The script, which is politically-charged and has a lot of truth to speak regarding America's historic and persistent issues with race relations, repeatedly seems more interested in making the political point, than telling a story that makes the political point. BlacKkKlansman is eye-opening and thought-provoking - but for a medium whose ""golden rule"" is ""show, don't tell,"" the film simply too often relies on the later approach."

","Legendary director Spike Lee has steadily made movies for some 35 years but it's been a good while since he was a true household figure.<br/><br/>Younger audiences may not even recognize the name although he was considered something of a wunderkind and pioneering black filmmaker way back in the 1980's and the first half of the 90's.<br/><br/>Having premiered at this year's Cannes festival and received six-minute standing ovation, ""BlacKkKlansman"" has turned out to be Lee's big comeback ""joint"", and deservingly so.<br/><br/>It's a timely and sharp overview of racism in the modern U.S. society but also a pretty damn fine intellectual comedy in its own right.<br/><br/>Despite the controversial topics such as racial inequalities and sticking it to Ku Klux Klan, what we have here is a long and talky movie mostly free of action, graphic violence or (er) real suspense.<br/><br/>Relying mostly on dialogue may sound like a weakness but Lee has really taken the most out of the both material and colorful cast led by promising newcomer John David ""son of Denzel"" Washington.<br/><br/>We also have this current hot indie star Adam Driver and also probably the most interesting movie performance by Topher Grace that you will ever see.<br/><br/>The social satire conveyed is Lee's usual but crisp indeed, including the horrifying and unexpected epilogue which kind of puts the central message in new, stronger perspective.<br/><br/>The dialogue is sharp and there's lots of it, the cast brave and committed - in fact, it's probably one of the better ensemble movies that one may catch in cinemas this year. The comedy is in the details - how the characters move, talk, and react to situations.<br/><br/>And last but not least, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is also a pretty cool period piece.<br/><br/>The true events have been moved from the end of the 1970's to the beginning, which enables to add ""disco age"" color to the atmosphere, from jeans, jackets and big afro wigs to blaxploitation movies to student marches, overt racism and police violence.<br/><br/>Lee is clearly nostalgic for these times, probably because of freshness of students being political and really trying to change the society.<br/><br/>Then again, the central themes used here are evergreen - such as readiness to stand up for what one believes in or how belonging to groups can change one's attitudes and perspectives<br/><br/>Based on the ambition and depth of social criticism it dares to offer, ""BlacKkKlansman"" feels like a true event movie, sort of Lee's new ""Malcolm X"" (starring Denzel Washington).<br/><br/>Luckily for us, the storytelling is more hip, and the movie itself shorter by a whole hour."

","I've gotta be honest, with a trailer like that, ""BlacKkKlansman"" held little chance of disappointment; not with such a charismatic performance from John David Washington. I can't even think of a weakness in this cast. The minute you see Alec Baldwin as a right-wing firebrand, you know you're in for something special.<br/><br/>It all starts with the wild premise - a black police detective infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan - the mechanics of such an operation are massively entertaining, and the sheer audacity of it is a constant eye-brow raiser. There's unbridled evil lurking throughout this movie, but it comes in the form of the small-minded. Let's face it, these white supremacists are morons (led by an equally hapless Topher Grace as David Duke), and their cruel intentions are regularly undermined by their simple natures. But Spike Lee pulls no punches here. The statement he's out to make with this is as time-worn as it is aggressive: hate finds its way into the top levels of power. And he makes no bones about tying it directly to modern-day politics. <br/><br/>In the end, this is a delightful period piece with an impressive cast and more than its share of laughs; a wicked surprise all around."

"thomasjay-2201","9","10","20","24 August 2018"," Amazing Film
","What a brilliant film this turned out to be. Regardless of criticism from other directors and the lack of attention this release has seen it's possibly the best film of the year. A compelling, interesting and hilarious story we see deep characters who grow and change along with the story. A great attempt at World Building from Lee gives Colorado Springs the feel of a massive city that's alsobisolated and disconnected from reality in a way. This brilliant cast give high standards of performance and all seem to bounce off each other brilliantly. There's a few pitfalls for everything great about the film, specifically the runtime towards the latter end in particular which does seem to drag on unnecessarily but is still entertaining and a few moments of in narrative social commentary are a bit jarring too but in the whole it's really well rounded. It's worth noting however that although there's issues linked quite closely to the runtime every second feels relevant as the finale is an after sequence of events which tie together the loose ends which have been left from the main plot.Harking back to the point in commentary this has to be one of the most important films of recent years and I can see this being studied worldwide in years to come as it does a superb job of highlighting social double standards, difference and progression and general social issues linked with such extreme views that the film explores. Highly recommend this release it's a fantastic watch.
 ****Spoilers**** <br/><br/>This is Spike Lee proving why he became so popular and successful in the first place. A film that brilliantly tackles social and political issues in such a fun and exciting way that's equal parts hilarious, sickening and sombre. The final shots of the film is archive footage of recent events and from the past two decades or so roughly. Frankly it's harrowing and something you've likely not seen before hence why it was the perfect end to this movie. Such awful, grim footage of the aftermaths of terror attacks, the filming of Klan rallies and speeches made by Donald Trump and the films real life villain David Duke really place emphasis on how much has and hasn't changed over the years following the setting of the film and chilling to the point of tear jerking, an outstanding message and fantastic level of craftsmanship on display, hats off"
"georgepsoady","9","10","20","24 August 2018"," One of a kind, Spike Lee has still got it!
","When it comes to films related to/about the Ku Klux Klan, it's an odd mix. From the earliest days of cinema, you had blatantly racist propaganda films such as 'Birth Of A Nation' - footage of which is shown in this film. Then to the 80s you had the controversial and apparent good-natured however very flawed thriller 'Mississippi Burning' - especially in its tone and message. And since then, you've had such things as the new all-black cast remake of 'Birth Of A Nation' which put the story correctly. However - from my point of view - you have never had a film about the KKK as strange and varied as this one.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not going to be like any other film you've seen, because it's not a film. It's a joint, which means Spike Lee is behind the camera, and most of the time, that means something brilliant is going to happen. And in this case, it does.<br/><br/>The film, set in the early 70s', loosely tells the true story of Ron Stallworth (played brilliant both comically and dramatic by John David Washington), a black detective in Chicago who pretends to be a white man to try and infiltrate the KKK, and to do so, gets his colleague and friend, Flip (played by Adam Driver) to go undercover as the white 'Ron Pearlman' and join the Klan. And while this plot may sound somewhat like a 'high concept idea' it becomes something much more complex and scary.<br/><br/>Towards the start of the film, Spike gently pulls our attention towards the story, with the laugh out loud humour and mocking of the Klan, making us developed and entertained, and making his central characters likeable. But slowly, as the films real messages start to unreavel we realise this isn't a comedy. However, it also isn't a drama. It's both, and the idea of the comedy and drama going back and forth, putting you in an awkward and nervous position on when to laugh and when not to laugh, works very well. Sitting in a fairly crowded cinema, I didn't know when to laugh and when to cry, and how other people in the audience would react.<br/><br/>Another thing that works very well is the films style. The film is shot like an early 70s' blackpoitation film, such as 'Super Fly' or 'Shaft' both of which are mentioned and referenced to in the film. Because of this, we hear a lot of funky 70s music, and we see light disco visuals, reminding of us of the style in 'Boogie Nights'. And this idea of 70s nostalgia is highlighted in a nightclub towards the start of the movie, shared by Ron, and his love interest - and also very well written complex character - Patrice.<br/><br/>And all of this style, substance and story is brought to life by the cast, who manage to balance the humour, drama and everything in-between brilliantly, at times making it all the more fun, and at others, making it much more scary and alarming.<br/><br/>But none of this would matter if it didn't really mean something. If it didn't have something dark and political to leave on our minds. Of course, it's a Spike Lee joint, so it's going to have some relevance today. And my god, does it. Yes it does! I was in tears in the final part of the movie, which, after laughing and smiling with these characters, racism still goes on, and one person won't change that. It takes a lot to change racism, and no matter how much we can laugh at the racist idiots, the KKK are still out there. And that message really leaves a massive impact on you as a viewer. It's a film where you don't want the lights to fade up, because your not sure what to say or how to feel, and a film like that comes very rarely. And that's why, truely why, BlackkKlansman is one of the best films of the year. 9.5/10"
"pawanedhaliwal","10","10","20","23 August 2018"," AmaZing!
","Definitely one of the best movies of 2018.
I am going to watch it again!"
"The-Sarkologist","9","10","20","20 August 2018"," Surprisingly Great
","I probably wouldn't necessarily say that this is a challenging film, at least from my perspective, but then again being who I am I don't tend to face discrimination in the way that many people in the world, particularly minorities in developed countries, do. Yet it does amaze me that there are people out there that are so caught up in their own sense of self importance, and their own pride, that they are willing to denigrate others simply because they look, or even act, differently. In a way this isn't so much a film about how a coloured man over came prejudice to achieve greatness, but rather how he played the Klu Klux Klan for a bunch of fools.
 Basically he really wanted to become a cop, and was accepted into the police force, but relegated to the evidence room. Sure, he faced quite a bit of discrimination, and the questions that he was asked at the beginning of the film, when he was applying for the position, really did sound as if they were racially profiling him - yet I wonder whether an anglo would be asked exactly the same questions. Sometimes I wonder whether some people take offence at being asked certain character questions when in reality these questions are asked of everybody.
 Yet this isn't really the case here either, because he was accepted into the police force, and was even promoted to the rank of detective, even though it had a lot to do with him being able to infiltrate a meeting of the Black Panthers. Once again, one raises the question of whether this is also racial profiling, particularly since the Black Panther's were a militant group, and that while the Black Panthers are being investigated, the Klu Klux Klan is being left alone, or even having its existence denied.
 However, while the movie focuses on the African-Americans, this isn't necessarily the only minorities that they are targeting. It is just that they tend to be the most visible. In fact, anybody who doesn't have an Anglo-Saxon heritage is basically going to be targeted by these people. It doesn't matter whether you are a Jew, a Mexican, or an African American - these people basically do not want you around.
 So, it makes me wonder sometimes what makes them tick. I suspect it is a fear of those who happen to be different, or more so, it is a fear if them being excluded from society. Yet it does come down to a question of privilege, and in reality, us Anglo-Saxons tend to have much more privilege than many of the minorities (though not necessarily all of them, as is the case here in Australia). 
 Yeah, I actually though that this was a pretty good movie, and it certainly doesn't take the stance that 'all white people are bad'. The thing with out protagonist is that he doesn't hate the cops - he wants to be one. Sure, he was the first African-American officer in the Colorado Springs police department, but the interesting thing is that people ended up warming to him. Once they got to know him, they realised that not all African Americans are bad people (which is generally the attitude of a lot of people, particularly those that live in the white enclaves).
 The thing is that despite the belief that the police unfairly target African Americans, he still believes in the system, which puts him at odds with his girlfriend, who happens to by sympathetic towards the Black Panthers. Obviously, this puts them at odds with each other, and it is left hanging in the air as to what happened between them. Of course, this film was written in response to the rise of far right extremists, not just in the United States, but all over the world. Particularly with the events in Charlottesville where there were clashes between the extreme right and the extreme left. Yet it seems that many actors on the extreme right seem to get away with the crimes that they commit. Whether that is true or not, it is difficult to tell because there is so much obfuscation over the events. Yet the reality is that there does seem to be one narrative for an Anglo criminal, and another narrative for everybody else, and even then that isn't necessarily the case because the same Anglo-narrative also applies to other minorities as well. 
 It is certainly a film worth seeing, and I did find it quite challenging in places, and it does raise the question of whether much as actually changed over the years."

","A genuinely disturbing exploration of racism in America disguised as buddy cop comedy. Don't let the trailers fool you, this is a fiercely political film that does not shy away from the horror of its central theme. And though I squirmed many more times than I laughed, BlacKkKlansman manages to entertain as much as it unsettles. Spike Lee smartly chose 70's blaxploitation as the framework for the film which enabled him to inject some levity into a subject that could've otherwise been harrowing and indigestible. With that framework, he has crafted a film which is equally playful and disquieting, one which is able to joke about the absurdity of racism in America all while impressing upon the viewer how far from a joke this really is. Some may call the ending cheap and sensationalist, but it undeniably pulls the rug out and forces you to simmer in the harshness of reality.

But this is a well crafted movie with a strong but not well known cast. The adapted screenplay and cinematography are first rate, and some of the scenes are imposing. One in particular, members of the local kkk watching the 1915 Birth of a Nation film was stomach churning.

Fully aware that the KKK would never accept a black man into their organisation, John suggests the idea of using his co-worker, white Jewish police officer Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), to pretend to be him when meeting with other Klan members in person, while still maintaining verbal contact over the phone.<br/><br/>As ingenious as it is aggressive, BlacKkKlansman is easily one of Spike Lee's best films in years and a solid commentary on society's views on racism in America. As to be expected, Lee does not hold back in showcasing the racial epithets and slang used against African Americans. However, he also chooses to juxtapose this with an extreme depiction of black nationalism in certain scenes, and this brings something of a balance to the overall story and makes it seem less biased. The acting between the two leads John David Washington (Denzel Washington's son) and Adam Driver is fantastic and it helps to make what may have been considered a farfetched plot had it not been a true story seem so believable. If one can stomach some of the more extreme scenes of racism and injustice, then this ""Joint"" is certainly worth the time to watch and discuss afterwards.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

","This movie was excellent from start to finish. I didn't know if this movie would be so good, but I enjoyed the movie a lot of how it tackled black issues and it gave you a good 70s field to the movie. John David Washington and Adam Driver really knocked it out of the park with the fantastic acting and team work. This provided great history lessons on Jesse Washington and the pain he went through and showed how the work against the KKK had to get deleted by the chief of police for some reason, but they felt the black nationalist groups were more dangerous than the KKK which is a shame. However, I did love how Spike Lee ended this movie with showing how times is America hasn't really changed at all and how we still have a long way to go. But all in all I loved this movie!"

I went to a sneak preview where we got to see a Q&A with Spike Lee & the cast where he went out of his way to say this is a movie to make you laugh & no matter how racist some of the humor might be, none of it's made up, these are actual words that have been used to demean others for decades! It's a good 2 hr movie but it never felt long & drawn out like some of Spike's other movies. I'd even pay to see this twice in theatre.

Lee weaves together the threads of Stallworth's insightful memoir, while heightening the drama with fictional elements.

A black undercover cop first infiltrates the Black Panthers at a lecture by Stokely Carmichael. He then takes the initiative to contact the KKK by phone, posing as a white man. He uses a fellow officer to meet face to face with the racists. Historical footage, from the high school at Little Rock to scenes from Birth of a Nation are used.

","When this film came out I was reminded of my second semester of 7th grade at Horace Mann junior high in Colorado Springs 50 years ago. Martin Luther King was recently asssasinated. I'm sitting in class, home room, when this kid behind me said ""they shot that nigger dead"". Having just come from Los Angeles and an integrated school I was sad and shocked to hear him say that. Lee's film does a spot-on job of showing how stupid and dangerous racists are in this country. I also realized, later, that racism is learned and not something we're born with. The current administration is supporting these groups in an active way and this worries me. By the way, the fros and clothes were a delight to see."

","So many boring movies with cookie cutter characters out now, and Spike Lee just nails it. I can't say I've been a fan, haven't really liked his characters before now, they always seemed a bit arrogant, but maybe he's chilled too, and now the maturity and experience is showing. It's like Tarantino meets Coen Brothers, and when I say that, I mean the classic elements, but then the Spike Lee twists come into play near the end. The ending made me cry, and I never want to see David Dukes' face again ever, he's a demon.<br/><br/>I wasn't keen on some of the pacing, but then again I think it had the pacing of an older movie - try Pulp Fiction now, and you realize movies used to take their time.<br/><br/>John David Washington is amazing! Laura Harrier, maybe a bit too pretty, but OK. Adam Driver as always shines it up, so droll, and where did they find all these other amazing black actors? Hollywood, come on, man, loads of great resources! Funny how the best films and shows of recent times are when there's a really properly diverse cast that mixes without always going on about their racial differences, which sound weird when I'm reviewing this film about the deep racism in the US, but it's true, really good writing to make the police team really feel like they care about each other, using black and white differences to do their job.<br/><br/>And then you see, ah yes, Jordan Peele and Jason Blum producing. No wonder this is great.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm white. Or am I...??????

"diablopale-41194","10","11","23","15 November 2018"," Spike Lee has made an incredible film which MUST be seen.
","My first impression of ""BlacKkKlansman"" was my reaction to seeing its name listed among the films selected to premiere in competition at the Cannes film festival. I remember thinking, ""Did the filmmakers really need to put the ""k"" between the two words? Isn't the ""K"" in ""Klansman"" enough?""<br/><br/>The answer to the first is yes; the answer to the second is no. This is a film which makes no attempt to explain its behaviour, which is original and relentless. The script wastes no time in packing in as many racist slurs as it possibly can, with no careful exposition clarifying that the people saying the words are bad. It goes without saying - the Klansmen are utterly detestable and the actors playing them seem in competition to be the most unpleasant. It says a lot about the careful, purposeful direction of Mr. Lee that the greatest merit the Klan characters have is that they aren't quite as socially unacceptable as Jasper Pääkkönen's Felix. Certainly Mr. Lee wishes to show that the well-spoken David Duke (Topher Grace) is deluded in believing that he is any better, by amping up the classical expressionism of the camera in Duke's scenes.<br/><br/>Speaking of the camera, it always seems to be in the right place. It works as an onlooker, never quite embracing a wholly ""modern"" style. Much has already been written about the ""creamy"" cinematography, designed to emulate the look of 70s exploitation cinema. This is a success, and the film's atmosphere bleeds through the screen similarly to ""Fargo"" Season 2 and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Inherent Vice"".<br/><br/>The soundtrack, by Terence Blanchard, whose fantastic work in Mr. Lee's ""25th Hour"" should not soon be forgotten, is in a league of its own, fading out through most of the dialogue and popping up in force to punctuate the previous scene and lead into the next. I'm a fan of this style: it allows for a much more energetic soundtrack. Certainly parallels must be drawn between the lone guitar and the character of Ron Stallworth, as played by John David Washington.<br/><br/>
Mr. Washington's performance, as well as Adam Driver's, will not be acclaimed enough, as ""BlacKkKlansman"" is not the type of film that allows for its performers to be the stars. Clearly Mr. Lee's focus is on the story (a compelling one, producer Jordan Peele has said that he successfully it to Mr. Lee in a mere six words) and the parallels found between the story and the world of today. That is, in part, what makes this such an interesting film. Like Mr. Peele's ""Get Out"", the film functions on the surface as an entertainment piece - a buddy-cop story with an ironic premise. That it's based on a true story elevates it to incredible. That said, this film does not have the subtlety of ""Get Out"" - not that it has to; that film would've been a mess if it had been too direct. In ""BlacKkKlansman"", we can appreciate that this is an attack on anybody that could dare to have a mindset ranging from Felix's to Duke's. It is a successful one. The film is profoundly moving and strongly independent. That's why the title has the ""k"". This is a Spike Lee joint."

Though Left-leaning, with subtle jabs at President Trump, its message is still important for all Americans.

There is a strong reminder that we are far from when this story actually took place which is unfortunate. I also like that this wasn't a one sided story. It shows that both sides hate the police, assuming they're all the same as well while Ron is stuck in the grey area in the middle.

"hunter-friesen","8","9","18","27 September 2018"," BlacKkKlansman Provokes and Entertains
","Spike Lee has always been one of the most outspoken directors for African American rights. His no holds barred mentality put him on the map in 1989 with ""Do the Right Thing"" and again in 1992 for his epic biopic ""Malcolm X"". However, the last decade has been rough for Lee as his films have been of lower quality and struggled to click with the mainstream crowd. Fortunately for Lee and moviegoers, his new film, ""BlacKkKlansman"", is a return to form as he delivers a thrilling crowd-pleaser that also isn't afraid to attack race in American society.<br/><br/>Taking place in 1979 Colorado Springs, the film follows the real-life story of Ron Stallworth, who has just become the first black cop in town. His hiring is met with hostility among the white officers, mostly ones that like to create trouble for the fun of it. <br/><br/>As a hot-headed rookie looking to make his mark and bring a little change, Ron decides to go after the local Ku Klux Klan chapter. Luckily for him, the Klan runs full ads in the paper to draw in recruits. <br/><br/>Ron picks up the phone and disguises his voice to sound like a white man in order to get information. His disguise works and he sets up a meeting with a recruiter. Obviously, Ron himself won't be able to go, so he sends white officer Flip Zimmerman to play as his white self. <br/><br/>From this point on, the story follows Ron and Flip running a tag team operation as they try to bring down one of the most hateful groups in America.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, we've gotten so used to Lee being overly loud and thunderous that it now feels a bit weird to see him show a decent amount of restraint when it comes to the volume of the message. He also paces the film really well for its 135-minute runtime. Action, comedy, and drama are interspersed, allowing the film to flow with great energy and rhythm. <br/><br/>Although Spike shows some restraint, he doesn't fully commit. At times he falls back into his old over the top habits. One moment of this is at the beginning when we are shown a fictional Klan propaganda film that serves no real purpose other than to make you hear endless racial expletives.<br/><br/>For a script that has four credited writers, one of which is Lee, the writing never feels fragmented. Right off the bat, the biggest compliment to the script is that it never is too preachy with its message. We do hear a lot about racism in America, but it never feels overdone. <br/><br/>One thing that the writers struggle to do is blend together two different plots. We have the main investigation plot with Ron and Flip, but we're also given a smaller romantic subplot between Ron and Patrice, an activist leader for black rights. Even though their romance does serve a purpose of highlighting racial tension in America, at times it feels shoehorned in and out of place.<br/><br/>Another minor thing that comes up periodically throughout is the writing for the Klan characters. Each one of them is onenote and are treated as cartoonishly evil. It makes them entertaining to watch, but it also makes it hard to take them seriously when real life or death stakes are presented.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is its characters and the actors that inhabit them. John David Washington, son of frequent Spike Lee collaborator Denzel Washington, gives one of the best leading performances of the year (so far). Just like his father, John carries a sort of charisma that makes his character feel authentic. He realizes his role is quite serious, but he also takes plenty of time to have fun with his character. It makes him very entertaining to watch, especially when he's playing ""White Ron"" over the phone. <br/><br/>Adam Driver does exceptional supporting work as Flip. Just like Washington, Driver takes things seriously but also partakes in the fun every once in a while. He also gives his character a lot of depth, who is a lapsed Jew that is now starting to wrestle with his religious identity. <br/><br/>Lastly, Topher Grace of ""That '70s Show"" fame is great as infamous real-life Klan leader David Duke. Grace brings a weasel like attitude to his demented character and shares great chemistry with Washington as they engage with each other over the phone from time to time.<br/><br/>Just like last year's breakout hit ""Get Out"", ""BlacKkKlansman"" is one of the rare occurrences where a film is both entertaining and able to send a powerful message about racism in America. Whether it be Spike Lee's powerful directing or the captivating performances, there's a lot to like in one of the year's best films so far."

"PotassiumMan","8","9","18","4 September 2018"," Spike Lee's return to form
","Easily Spike Lee's best joint since ""25th Hour"", this is the true story of how a black police officer in Colorado in the 1970s stood up to the Ku Klux Klan's presence through an undercover operation. In this film, Spike Lee has gone back to his old school rage that permeates the social fabric of America in the present day. It's a thoroughly relevant drama and an affirmation of American identity, one that burns with righteous anger but also has moments of incendiary humor aimed at the racism being depicted.<br/><br/>Performances here are first rate. John David Washington is the title protagonist, a bold black police officer in an overwhelmingly white community who dares to use his investigative ability to counter white supremacists in his own backyard, an idea he embraces after being sent on an undercover assignment to keep an eye on the black panther movement where he finds much agreement and closeness with those he encounters. Topher Grace shakes off his polished preppy boy image for the menacing role of David Duke, the grand wizard of the KKK. Adam Driver is solid as the undercover Jewish police officer who enters the KKK as the white front for the undercover operation. Although the film concludes less dramatically than I was expecting, it still packs a wallop in terms of bringing very relevant issues of white supremacy to the forefront.<br/><br/>This is also a cautionary tale about how resilient white supremacy has been over the course of the nation's history right up to the present day. It's a warning that the same scourge that plagued American society in the era when this film took place is still festering in full force today. A challenging message like that is worth conveying, which this film does eloquently. Strongly recommended."
"Lewis_Heather787","8","9","18","2 September 2018"," Multiple genres in one!
","Got to say as soon as the trailer for this film dropped a few months ago, I was completely hooked on the film and couldn't wait to see what was in store. Overall I thought the film was very good, but maybe not as good as I thought it could have been. For the most part this film was very interesting to watch crossing multiple genres whilst carry the heavy subject matter and handling it really well. <br/><br/>Spike Lee has managed to direct a film that has such a fantastic balance to it in terms of tone. The subject matter and language used throughout the film is dark and extremely strong however this is balanced perfectly with some brilliant humour that contrasts so well. The film really needs it otherwise this film could get to depressing. Beautifully shot from start to finish I'd have to say one of his better films, all round really good and actually surprisingly entertaining for such a dark story. <br/><br/>John David Washington and Adam Driver are just brilliant as Ron Stallworth and Flip Zimmerman. Their chemistry on screen is fantastic throughout, although it does start out in a very different place to where it ends, there is a real arc between to two men in the film. Involved in some really uncomfortably funny scenes either with each other or when the klan are involved. Both are scene stealers in the very different situations they are in as Ron Stallworth. Cant wait to see what film they do next. The other standout for me was Jasper Pääkkönen who played Felix. The part I like most about his portrayal is the fact that they didn't try to back him a cartoon character in that way. Spike Lee in a weird way, in my opinion, has tried to humanise the character of Felix ,(if that can be done for a member of the klan), instead of just going down the road of the cartoon like the character of Ivanhoe which is very cartoonish. All the performances across the board are great these just standout.<br/><br/>The film has faced some criticism for how it has portrayed some of the events in the film and that they are dramatised. For example the real Ron Stallworth, to my knowledge and research, didn't phone the klan he instead wrote them a letter. If its minor details like this that are being slightly changed then all the better for it. What would you rather watch the version we got with the phone call or him writing a letter, I think I prefer the version we got. If it bugs people out some much then just google Ron Stallworth and find out for yourself also show me a film ""based on a true story"" that doesn't dramatise certain events.<br/><br/>Overall I think the film is very good 80% out of 100 or 8 out 10 maybe not as good as I thought it was going to be, but that my own stupid expectations getting in the way. I know that internationally this film will probably go down well however in America erm....... I don't know. In this extremely bizarre, weird and divisive time for that country I dunno.....maybe its the right time, if not now then when. The ending with the clips of Charlottesville is extremely poignant and emotion, its a chilling reminder in how little America and the whole world has come and the direction its going in."

","With Spike Lee's recent filmography making a disappointing and mediocre impression towards critics and audiences, BlacKkKansman is considered a glorious return to form for Spike Lee and without a doubt, one of the best films of the year and also a superior film that surpasses Spike Lee's other acclaimed films such as Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X. BlacKkKansman truly delivers an outrageous yet interesting true story that blends very well with funny one-liners and quips as well elements of comedy, in which that type of technique was previously used in The Wolf of Wall Street. Furthermore, it also adds a realistic yet accurate timely themes that tackles on the issue of racism, white supremacy, current events and divisive politics under Trump era that define the American perspective.<br/><br/>Apart from Spike Lee's masterful direction, this film is also defined by a shocking, compelling and riveting performances from John David Washington, Adam Driver and Topher Grace. Clearly, BlacKkKansman is a worthy film that allows an educational insight of showing America's current political moment as well the viewpoint of racial prejudices while at the time, making the film as funny and not as boring."

","You watch too many movies and have act plots memorized, know every cinematography bullet they teach in college, and got an idea for how audio should be mixed? Yeah, well, this movie breaks all of that and it is such a breath of fresh air. The cinematography is dramatic, but not distracting, it's artsy without alienating the not-artsy crowd (I usually hate artsy movies), the audio mixing is level except when it it counts the most. Without spoiling, there are times a telephone rings way louder than the rest of the movie, and there's a spot where the audio becomes gradually louder and more chatoic, but you don't notice until it suddenly drops absolutely dead quiet. This movie does such an amazing job setting mood that the theater was absolutely stunned at the end. It's damn easy to follow if you're the average movie goer, but breaks a lot of conventions that'd get a sigh from a critic. I take pride in that I know how much runtime is left in a movie based on what textbook bullet point on a three or two act structure the movie is on, but because this movie didn't restrain itself to a textbook, it flows so nicely, I had no idea when the movie was gonna end, and yet I was still stunned when it did."

","My Movietown companion Cole is a Spike Lee fanatic. Not only has he seen all the venerable director's major motion pictures, he's also seen his stand-up films, documentaries, and specials, rarely giving any of them less than a stellar review. Therefore, I usually defer to him when it comes to Lee joints. However, for whatever it's worth, coming from a Spike Lee noob like myself, BlacKkKlansman is a bonafide masterpiece that will remind anyone who needs it that Lee is a certified genius of kinetic and alarming filmmaking. 
Telling the 70's story of a black cop who goes undercover to infiltrate the KKK, it seems to be a perfect fit for Lee's prolific 30-year career. It's a ridiculous story used to make a point about the black experience in America, bolstered by the fact that it all actually happened. The mixture of hyper-blaxploitation-style, insane reality and deft comedy begs comparisons to late-20th century classics like Goodfellas, not to mention the endless number of memorable scenes, bold performances, and strong language. Undercover cop lie detector scene? Tensely paced. Alec Baldwin racist-speech opening? Striking and uncomfortably funny. Black College Society speech? Movingly edited and uniquely beautiful. 
It holds together (with shocking and appreciated entertainment value) to show the dangerously powerful influence of popular media on personal beliefs and the complex nature of systemic racism. Never one to hide his point, Lee draws straight, dark lines from this story to our modern political world, which will inevitably split attentive audiences down the middle; but regardless of individual leanings, there's no denying that BlacKkKlansman is a stressful, sobering and powerful true-life good-time."

Tere is research at the level of historical references and the recent images of the Charlottesville riots, shown at the end make a very good conclusion and leave us speachless, bringing us back the tragic events. The only negative point for me is humour, sometimes a bit excessive and often caricatural but it does not change the fact that this film is a hit. It's very compelling and moving because Ron Stallworth falls in love with Patrice. In addition, the reconstruction of the 70's is very well done with clothes, catchy music, haircuts, especially cars ! I rate the film 8 of 10!"
"GillisaLrt","8","10","21","2 December 2018"," Such a great movie
","This film is really moving because it is based on a true story. Spike Lee is such an amazing film director and once again he did a really good job! His movie is between a comedy and a thriller. I mean here that he talked about the problems of racism in the USA but with a lot of humour and that's a good point.
Let's talk about the story. Spike Lee, in his movie speaks about a secret organisation named the Ku Klux Klan who's a racist organisation who want to exterminate all black and jewish people, all the people who aren't white American. To stop the KKK, a black policeman, Ron Stallworth, will infiltrate the KKK with someone else inside the police who's jewish. Kind of funny don't you think?
Throughout the film we will ask ourselves how will they arrived to arrest them without being unmasked.
Now let's talk more about the cast. Here again Spike Lee did such an amazing job. All actors are good. Every single actor is performing well. John David Washington as Ron Stallworth is, for me, a really good revelation. This movie is certainly at the top of my list of good movies.

To me, this fascinating film is very good way to send a message about racism in the USA. First of all, the actors are talented and they make this film very funny. I already knew John David Washington as East in The Walking Dead show, but he impressed me as Ron Stallworth. I also liked the actor game of Adam driver as Flip who was a very interesting character. In short, the cast of this film is excellent. I really like this kind of story because to me, racism is one of the worst crime in the world and I didn't know a lot of things about the Ku Klux Klan.

","I'm not a Spike Lee fan, necessarily. This movie has given me a reason to become one. What I liked most about this movie, other than the imaginative title, is that Spike Lee shows that there is also camaraderie between black and white, something that is very true in real life, but unfortunately that doesn't make the news headlines. And this is back in the 70's! I was pleasantly surprised to see a movie that showed that. Granted it must have been a part of Ron Stallworth's experience, but nonetheless, I appreciate that Spike Lee appropriately focused on it. The movie itself was entertaining, funny and moving. John David Washington did a great job portraying Stallworth. And I loved Adam Driver's character. He's turning out to be one of my fav actors.<br/><br/>With all the hassles of ""racism"" in today's America, I loved that this movie showed one man's story of courage, imagination and success assisted, helped and applauded by his workmates...regardless of his or their color.

"Aly200","8","10","21","27 August 2018"," Relevant, timely and Spike Lee's best to date
","With movements like #BlackLivesMatter and of course the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s-1970s, this Spike Lee film couldn't have arrived at a better time in modern history. Taking the true story of Ron Stallworth, the sole African-American cop in the Colorado Springs PD in the early 1970s who through a clever ruse infiltrated the KKK, we are treated to an engaging character-driven film and the memorable dialogue we expect from Mr. Lee's body of work.<br/><br/>In the lead role, we get to see the talents of John David Washington (son of Oscar winner Denzel) who brings a wonderful grounded feel to Ron. He is a determined and committed cop who through non-violent means risks his life to undermine the world's most lethal racist group. Yes the move is foolish when we first learn of it with Ron's other colleagues, but Washington's charisma and drive make us cheer him along and hope he succeeds with his bizarre plan. The young actor also develops an excellent chemistry with his co-stars, Laura Harrier and Adam Driver (who both play crucial roles within the narrative), which drives the emotional weight of the operation and why it must not be derailed (although we have several close calls). Maybe we shall see an awards season nod for Washington's brave performance.<br/><br/>The key competent to making Stallworth's plan function is that he must have a Caucasian coworker on the force pose as him in person (as he is posing as a white man on the phone). That person turns out to be Adam Driver's Phillip 'Flip' Zimmerman, a Jewish officer on the Colorado Springs PD (another group despised by the KKK). Initially hesitant to encourage or even participate due to the danger involved, Driver's Zimmerman nevertheless remains loyal to his fellow officer and takes on the role of being the fake Ron. The charisma we have seen from the 'Star Wars' actor in past roles is kept low-key in this joint as we must uncomfortably hear him utter racist epithets and carry this ruse onward though near the film's climax we fear for Flip as he is nearly unmasked as a fraud. <br/><br/>Honorable mentions for Laura Harrier as the fiery Patrice, a fierce supporter of the Black Power movement and head of the African-American Student Union. The actress is spunky and sassy, but remains guarded and distrusting of the police (much like anti-police brutality groups of now) because of her race and treatment based on said factor. However Patrice is a strong role model for standing up for her beliefs and will protect her cause, but in non-violence like MLK Jr.'s teachings. And the other mention goes to a game-changing turn from Topher Grace as former Grand Dragon (the head of the KKK) David Duke. He is menacing in a subtle fashion without any overacting or having to utter much hate speech. His commanding of the KKK is calculating, using intimidation and fear and if needed violence (which he never see him order personally in the film). <br/><br/>If you're looking for the right political drama, this is the one for you. Be warned that it isn't for the easily offended."

I was entertained for the whole runtime. I mean, I didn't totally get why the bit with Alec Baldwin was there at the beginning, but after that it was great. <br/><br/>The scenes on the phone are some of the funniest things I've ever seen. <br/><br/>This movie uses some real footage from around last year, and its just depressing that this things are happening in this day and age. Even more so that a fight actually broke out at a showing at the theater I went to a few days before I saw the movie. Apparently someone was cheering on the white supremacists running over protesters. Honestly I'd be surprised if a fight didn't break out after something like that happened. <br/><br/>Still a great movie though. I would highly recommend watching.

","Spike Lee's ""BlackkKlansman"" is by far one of the most entertaining movies in the last decade. Lee adds a witty style and composes this outrageous true story into something truly special and engaging. This layered film has a wide range of storytelling techniques that generate a fresh and gripping true story and refuses to let go. John David Washington gives a breakthrough performance as the first black police officer in Colorado Springs who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan as an undercover detective yet it's Adam Driver who steals the show as the Jewish detective who comes face-to-face with these truly frightening individuals. Topher Grace does his best work yet as David Duke, being surprisingly funny yet still horribly racist.

David Duke, the still extant former klan leader, is portrayed in the film by a restrained and creepy Topher Grace.<br/><br/>The film has a couple of genuinely heartening moments that put a smile on my face, and a stirring montage of actual film clips of recent years to conclude the film, and frame the true story in today's world.<br/><br/>Spike Lee does not just make topical, controversial films, a la Oliver Stone. He is an auteur with a lively and unique style of his own. His films are, as near as I can tell always of interest.

The wonderfully quirky story of a fresh young black police officer infiltrating the cocooned world of the local Klan and humiliating its hierarchy is told through such panache. Wonderful acting and a cracking soundtrack brings each scene alive and all references to black culture and the civil rights struggle are delivered with such poignancy, humour and at times with such powerful lines that the overall effect is like watching a wondrous creation by a masterful auteur. Of course the symbolism of Charlottesville and Trump's pandering to the alt-right makes it a very contemporary film, but even without that Lee is a class above all other retelling of the black struggles that have come out in cinema over the last few years."

"smootheezrule","9","6","11","26 August 2018"," Outstanding work with meaning portrayed through every means.
","As the first review I've ever written, this movie made me want to share how powerful and well written it was.
Although the plot is relatively ordinary with the undercover cop scenario, it includes uses of humor and circumstantial irony that makes the audience so engaged. It captures racial injustice that will leave you furious as you have to sit and watch the injustice occur, but it will also leave you leaping with joy when justice has been served. And although the film does discuss racial injustice, it doesn't make all the white characters unlikable as many of the cops were supportive of Washington and his cause. The producer doesn't narrowly point to the discrimination of blacks, as he brings into light antisemitism among the extremist members. 
There is so much to think about after watching this movie. The movie does end with footage of the riots in Virginia in 2017. Some may find this unappealing, but it is one of the major themes to the movie, that this sort of extremism is still existent today in the United States. 
I would have given this a 10 star rating, but the filmography style wasn't particularly my favorite, although it was effective for film.<br/><br/>So yeah, definitely recommend. I will probably watch this thirty more times."

From the story to the humor to the method that Ron Stallworth used to take down the KKK. Even though I thought this movie was the best, it did leave me with some questions about some small details like who is Adam Driver's character based off of if he isn't a character created only for the film and if it was that easy for Ron to Fool David Duke into believing that Adam Driver's character is the same person on the phone.

The reality that was still so prevalent such a short time ago is extremely eye opening. Very much an educational piece. The clips in the end were also a fantastic addition, these people are still at large today and are very much overlooked by us.

","BlacKkKlansman is a great film. This is the only film this year where I took as much away from it as I did. It really makes you think of the controversial decisions made in society today. The son of famous actor Denzel Washington, John David Washington, is in this film and he gives his star performance. Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) also gives a fine performance as a Jewish cop pretending to be a klan member. This real meat on the bone is at the end when the last ten minutes come and it's footage of the Black Lives Matter group and Presdient Trump explaining some controversial stuff. By the final shot of the film, my mind blew with its powerful symbolism and realistic message. Tis might be my favorite film of the year, it might beat Hereditary and A Quite Place, it may not. The first half is pretty slow however and some odd comedic timing, which are my only real flaws with this movie. I'm gonna give BlacKkKlansman an 8/10."

"cultfilmfan","10","8","16","3 September 2018"," Blackkklansman
","Spike Lee has not had a commercial, or critical hit since 2006's Inside Man, and after that he would often attempt to get bigger films off the ground such as Miracle at St. Anna, or his remake of Oldboy, a few years ago, but both films were neither received well, nor did they have the box office receipts to prove they were hits, in fact the complete opposite. Lee, who I have always admired as a filmmaker, did get other projects going since and during that time, but mostly they were smaller films that would only play in the very biggest of cities meaning that if you lived anywhere else you would either have to rent, buy, or stream the films in order to keep up to date with his body of work. Lee needed a film that was both going to be a critical success, but also one that would attract audiences and actually make some money as well. When his new film, Blackkklansman premiered at Cannes, I am certainly not sure what audiences, or critics were expecting, but the result turned out to be Lee's best reviewed film in probably longer than a decade as well as winning some of the top prizes at Cannes, which in my mind because of their very particular, yet often right on the money judgements, this meant that Lee's new film was great, but how would audiences fare and let alone the movie when it had a theatrical release date right in the middle of summer which we often know can be very difficult for smaller and more intelligent films? Blackkklansman continued to earn rave reviews as more critics were able to see it and the film was even given a wide release by it's distributor and the film was made for roughly 15 million dollars and after not even a month of release it has already doubled that amount in box office returns and has many saying that it is certainly a contender for Best Picture at next year's Oscars and in my mind, I wouldn't be surprised if the film, or Lee himself were standing on that stage next year picking up their awards. Having now seen the film myself, I will have to be honest and say that the style and tone of the film was a bit of a surprise to me because I was not expecting it to be so comedic and yet I found it often worked by also dealing with pretty upsetting subject matter and allowing us a chance to breathe and also to get immersed within the film and have a good chuckle as well as getting some hard hitting material as well, so I felt the balance which at first may have taken a little bit to get used to, ended up working beautifully. The story in itself is one of this year, or any recent year's most interesting plots around and the fact that it is all based upon a true story further adds fascination and a great emotional impact at the end of the film. The performances both by the leading cast as well as supporting were all fantastic and some of the best of the year. The script which Lee had a hand in writing is often smart, funny, intriguing and like any of Lee's best films, it also hits home and gets a point across that will certainly leave you shaken and stunned by the time you have walked out of the theatre. Lee has always been known for being angry at the world's injustices especially regarding race and this new film is no different. I appreciated that the violence in the film was toned down and realistically there was very little of it, so I think it would also bring more viewers in that way. The racial hatred, bigotry and language of which the film has lots, can be offensive and almost sickening at times, but we know why Lee went for this and he certainly gets his point across and then some. This is a film that is fascinating entertainment and also entertainment that will make you think about what you have just seen and may even change the way you look at current events and American history itself. The all too true aspect that is most disturbing is that this kind of hatred and acts of violence still exist and there are too many of these type of stories in the news today which makes the message of this film all the more timely and prevalent. This is one of the year's best films if not the best film of the year so far."
"simpsonbrn","10","8","16","1 September 2018"," An important and unsettling film
","This Ron Stallman biopic offers a powerful message about the origins and persistence of race hate. Undoubtedly something that will leave supporters of the current US administration uncomfortable, it nonetheless shows how the poison of race hate that has affected America for centuries has once again been validated by politicians and become mainstream. Spike Lee is not afraid to mix humour in among the drama but overall it still leaves the audience with a strong message."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","8","16","27 August 2018"," Schockingly relevant
","An important and absolutely relevant film these days. I loved how Spike Lee mixed history with little hints of today's political situation sometimes more literal than expected. Lee portrays racism as an never ending conflict and war but also kind of spoofs it in a very respectful way. Even if some of the characters were too cartoonish for my taste. Like Connie.
Nevertheless it was an important and effectly entertaining ride that gives us some of the best performances of the years at this stage. First of all there is Denzel's son John David Washington's who inheritated his fathers talent and follows his legacy. Another great performance came from Adam Driver who is Devine and steals many of the films scenes. Jasper Päakkönen gives possibly the best performance in the film. Sure his character appears to be very cartoonish too, on the paper however he is convincing with his rough and sometimes frightening aura. Laura Harrier was also wonderful and gives the film the right heart and soul. Nice change for Topher Grace in an unexpected role. Great cameo by Alec Baldwi. The score was fantastic, some editing really wonderful. Its your typical Spike Lee joint... as it was made in the 90s so glad he is back to good quality films again. The screenplay was very good as well and I loved the general look of it. Good film with many great references of the actual situation. The ending footage was heartbreaking and the most perfect way to end a film like this."

Uncomfortable topics were covered from hindsight that are just as relevant today as they were then; race relations, police relations, mindsets of individuals and organizations. The movie was humorous at times yet at other times very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>John David Washington has fine tuned his craft as an actor. He inherited his father's (Denzel's) good looks AND his ability to draw you into his world from the very first scene. Spike Lee & Jordan Peele are to be commended for an outstanding film that will probably become a classic. There will be conversations sparked by this film now and in years to come. Outstanding!"

","Here's the thing: it is possible for me to say that this movie works, that this Spike Lee joint is his best in a while, that it is both funny and powerful...but still think it could have been a little better. That's where I am. The movie's great as a broadly comedic satire with a political edge, and its many homages to film (from blaxploitation to D.W. Griffith) feel on point and at home here. More importantly, Lee brilliantly leverages a 1970s tale to shine a light on what's happening around us right now. So what could be better? Well, that light is REALLY bright. This is not a subtle political satire. At all. Typical Spike, basically. Also, the plot's pacing leaves something to be desired. And the characters sometimes seem a bit less than real. In fact, it is kind of funny that a movie inspired by a true story is most challenged by a lack of realism. But there you are. Still, Lee adapts this tale brilliantly. It is funny and exciting and insightful, especially as an examination of self identity. Just because it is flawed doesn't mean it isn't great."
"Blogger66","9","9","19","21 October 2018"," Joke is on Trump Voters!
","Unsurprisingly, Spike Lee nailed it once again under two circumstances: entertainment and education. That's uniquely rare for someone to have the ability to hit both spots that are the two dramatically different in the range of theme.<br/><br/>Blackkklansman is at a particular place of a genre that I would call as comedically propagation.<br/><br/>It's about a black man who entered the police department that had a full of white employers. He took that as his advantage to pave the way to destroy the white supremacy (Ku Klux Klan).<br/><br/>It was terrific how Spike Lee could summarize the whole historical events regarding racism from confederate era to modern days at the same time it was a fun viewing for everyone (except for these sensitive and insecure white people). I was quite impressed with the editing parts, whereas the plot was parallel to the editing scenes from The Birth of a Nation (an infamous white supremacy propaganda film in the 1910s).<br/><br/>Nearly every dialogue was funny with plenty of underlying meanings. It revealed how it was like to live as a black man and what he could literally see through white people without their realizations.<br/><br/>The last shot in the film of two black men pointing the gun in front of the audience was probably the most potent ending scene of all Hollywood films. The given message was that white people (especially those who voted for Trump) are ignorant and selfish, and the rest of people shall join and play on the same field along with Trump voters. Take them as a joke like how stupid people can go that far to promote segregation, vote for Trump, etc. Just enjoy playing on the field with them. Nonetheless, we will leave with a victory because we rather not be ignorant.<br/><br/>I took a star off my rating for Blackkklansman due to my doubt on the fact that is based on a true story. Otherwise, I recommend everyone to see. It would be a loss to miss out Blackklansman as one of a few films that would change your view in life in a way or else."

I was raised in the Deep South, but taught to not see race. Unfortunately however too much of our history is written on a G rated level. Our history isn't a G rated film. That narrative is not what this country needs. And this history is doomed to repeat itself if we aren't exposed to the truth of our country's heritage. I'm very grateful to have seen this film and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.<br/><br/>A warning though: this movie is absolutely sold as a comedy, but this is not a comedy.

","Watched an interesting interview with Spike Lee the director of this movie and it increased my interest to see BlacKKKlansman 100%
Spike Lee's hope is that young Americans will vote on mass in the mid term elections to send a massage to ""Agent Orange"" his reference to Donald Trump and the Republicans when they see this movie.
This disturbing and at times frightening movie is an adaptation of true events in Colorado in the late 1970's when Ron Stallworth an African American infiltrated the ranks of the Klu Klux Klan.
It's hard to watch at times not because of the violence or events but because of the realisation that these racist humans and the hateful offensive language they spew out are alive and well and living in America and worse, in pockets of Australia today.
This was emphasised by actual footage used in the movie of The White Nationalists riots in Charlottesville 2017 , when 3 people were killed and Trump defended them by saying "" Some Very Fine People on Both Sides.
This movie is important, well acted and directed and does what good movies are supposed to do entertain but also educate and inform.
John David Washington, son of Denzel is impressive as Ron Stallworth as is Adam Driver as Flip Zimmerman the white decoy cop who is the means for Stallworth to trick the Klan Master.
I especially liked Ashlie Atkinson in the difficult role of the ignorant stupid wife married to a hateful monster
and following his every edict to inflict terror on the innocent in the name of so called ""Christian Ayrian Supremacy.""
Harry Belafonte the famous Calypso singer , actor and Civil Rights champion now 91 gives an incredibly moving performance as Jerome Turner retelling the atrocious murder by whites of a young black man in the early 20th Century to an assembly of black students.
It wasn't just the hate and racial slurs of coloured people that disturbed me ,all minority groups including Jews , faggots and anyone that differed in appearance, religious belief or ideology was included in this story that is as relevant today, especially today as it was in the 1970's<br/><br/>

"jadepietro","9","10","22","12 August 2018"," A Spike Lee History Lesson
","B+ <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: An important film about race relations, then and now.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Spike Lee's scathing indictment of civil unrest, BlacKkKlansman takes place in another time, the mid-seventies, but it is far from a period drama. Directed with unabashed anger and expert filmmaking skill, this wake-up call to America relates its true story of two undercover cops who infiltrate the KKK to expose their criminal activities. But it doesn't remain lost in the seventies as it equates then to now, both in words, archival footage, and recent contemporary events that pave the way to more disgraceful behavior and moral offenses. (It is no coincidence that the film is being released on the first anniversary of the Charlottesville Virginia protest against white supremacist groups that resulted in 35 injuries and the death of Heather Heyer. That fact becomes part of this epic story too.)<br/><br/>The director addresses the prejudice long found in our society through the use of Hollywood early cinema. There is a bit of a disconnect with its prologue, Victor Fleming's 1939's Gone With the Wind (with its iconic shot of Confederate soldiers lay dying on the streets of Atlanta) before the film's central plot begins. As the film progresses, Mr. Lee connects the dots with past sins and present ones. He hurls his rage later on with the inclusion of D.H. Griffith's 1915 Birth of a Nation to maximum effect. <br/><br/>Spike Lee's screenplay, co-written by the director and David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Wilmott, chronicles its stranger-than-fiction tale of a black rookie police officer, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), and his personal awakening to ""white hate"". His on-the-job experience leads him to a meeting of two extremist groups, Black Power activists and the Knights of Ku Klux Klan. Going undercover with the former group is no problem for Ron, but he must enlist the aid of a white Jewish officer, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), to take over his identity in order to impersonate him and insinuate himself into the latter group. All this leads up to a meeting with Grand Wizard David Dukes (Topher Grace) and exposing these abhorrent hate-mongers and their terrorism. <br/><br/>Mr. Lee's films always are concerned with righting wrongs. Unafraid to call out racial prejudice, xenophobia, anti-semitism, and homophobia, his cinematic statements (or as he calls them ""joints"") deal with current issues and our continued repeating of past mistakes. Some critics call it propaganda, I call it passion and a voice to be heard. This is grandiose filmmaking, ambitious in its epic undertaking and overstuffed with multiple storylines and stark imagery. In fact, Mr. Lee does take some liberties with actual facts in the real life events of Det. Stallworth's story and his tone of the film shifts dramatically in its mood swing into occasionally dark satire to convey the irony and cruelty of the human condition. Borderline outrageous, the chain of events almost becomes a crazy quilt of America's bigotry with images and narrative absurdly colliding against each other, resembling a dated blaxploitation movie of that era. The film is manipulative and heavy-handed in some portions, but it is mostly powerful and disturbing in its content.<br/><br/>He cast his film with actors who are so physical right for their roles which gives an immediate authenticity to the film. Laura Harrier, Ryan Eggold, Paul Walter Hauser, Corey Hawkins,, Nicholas Turturro, and Harry Belafonte are especially fine in their parts. Most effective are Mr. Grace as the KKK leader, Jasper Pääkkönen as one of his henchman and Ashlie Atkinson who plays his white supremacist wife, Connie, delivering the menace and bile extremely well. But the core of the film is the relationship between the two detectives and both Mr. Washington and Mr. Driver are excellent. They imbue a real chemistry together. Alec Baldwin brings strong support playing against type in a role that forms a fascinating paradox with his common persona.<br/><br/>There are major set pieces that impress with the director's free-ranging style. Very notable is his trademark crosscutting of contrasting scenes with the Klansmen and their families viewing the Griffith film in rapturous attention and chanting ""white power"" while in another part of the city, black students listen in awe to a lecture about the senseless murder of an innocent black man as they shout ""black power"". The variance between the two groups is startling. Never one to shy away from making a political statement or two, Mr. Lee uses intense documentary imagery in his film's climax to hold our president personally responsible for the hatred and polarized climate in our splintered nation.<br/><br/>Production values are strong throughout with special mention to Chayse Irvin's lush cinematography and Barry Alexander Brown's skillful editing. Terrence Blanchard provides the musical soundtrack with carefully selected songs of the era to comment on and advance the action.<br/><br/>BlackkKlansman is an important film that needs to be seen and heard. It uses historical fact-based incidents in its savage exposé of racial intolerance. <br/><br/>It is one of Mr. Lee's finest achievements and one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>And, yes, despite (or because of) the blind ignorance of the 2013 Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling stripping away key elements of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and our present-day 45th United States political leader's sanctioned bigotry, racism is still alive and doing quite well."

","10 September 2018
First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - BlacKkKlansman. Based on the book by Ron Stallworth, the first African-American police officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department, this is a story of his early life. Spike Lee has tackled this subject full on, not really grabbing the bull by its horns but climbing onto its back and galloping right down the street - metaphorically speaking. This is the tale of a man who had always dreamed of becoming a cop. However his career is not as exciting as he thinks it should be and he finds himself stuck in the filing department. He gets an undercover assignment as a detective and manages to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. For this he needs the help of a white colleague who acts as the face to his voice. Ron is played by John David Washington, son of actor Denzel Washington, and he is certainly carrying on the family tradition with his considered style of acting, lots of emotion and plenty of thoughtful looks and body language rather than a lot of dialogue, a style that certainly wins us over. A solid performance from Adam Driver too, I look forward to seeing more of his work. This film gives us an insight into the world of the Klan, or the Organisation as they prefer to be known - and it's a scary world. This is a brave subject to tackle and Spike Lee has done it with a frankness that is extraordinary. It's a film with depth of emotion and frightening reality especially the scenes just before the end credits. How can you not be moved by this subject in all the scenes portrayed. Some excellent acting and very thought-provoking, and the script provides us with a reminder of how our language has changed and what has become unacceptable. Not the type of film I expected but extremely gripping."
"bastille-852-731547","7","25","67","9 August 2018"," Interesting New Spike Lee Joint
","Spike Lee has returned with the thoughtful and intensely relevant ""BlacKkKlansman,"" a drama about an African-American police officer in Colorado Springs attempting to infiltrate a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. The film uses a wide variety of common motifs in Spike Lee's films that enhance the story and the viewing experience considerably. Such motifs include deeply topical social commentary and analysis on the nature of racism and hatred, clever homages to other films of the time period (especially Blaxploitation films,) and a variety of visual tricks to help direct the viewer's attention to what is most important in the scene. The story moves along quickly and thoroughly, and its use of characterization is generally well-planned. Ron Stallworth is a charismatic and generally well-developed lead character, and most of the film's major supporting characters all serve unique purposes akin to the plot. The only possible weak link in the cast is Topher Grace as David Duke. While he does not give a bad performance, his portrayal of the infamous KKK leader can sometimes feel rather tepid at times.<br/><br/>Some might say that the film could have been enhanced by generally not reducing its depiction of KKK members to primarily cartoon stereotypes, but I would argue that this depiction actually helps Lee's greater point about the true nature of the Klan. Lee is trying to portray that their cataclysmic ignorance and buffoonishness breeds their insidious racism. The film's script includes a lot of current political commentary, which generally feels well-placed but can sometimes feel too on-the-nose or predictable. The film's story is engaging and entertaining, but does contain some cliches and relatively formulaic elements. Deeply disturbing real-world images and materials are effectively used by Lee to help synthesize the film's structure. The film's tonal shifts between comedy and dark drama do not feel poorly planned at all, although some could say they are a bit jarring. While it isn't Spike Lee's best, this is still a solid and highly thought-provoking film that should definitely please Lee's fans. Recommended. 7/10"

","Spike Lee's ""Blackkklansman"", a contender in last year's Cannes Festival, just became one of the nominees for Best Picture in Oscar this year, expectedly. ""Do the right thing"" (1989) was probably the movie that established Lee as an auteur director, in both artistic flare and moral conviction. Take away the racial politics element, however, ""Blackkklansman"" is very much an entertaining police undercover yarn, with more accent on the comic than on the thriller flavor. The humor, however, is double-edged. It is probably even more effective than graphic violence as a vehicle for condemning bigotry. The ridicule and absurdity get the message through, in ""Do the right thing"", and again in ""Blackkklansman"". But make no mistake about it. In ""Blackkklansman"", Lee is not pulling any punches. The hammering comes at the end, after the main body of the movie.<br/><br/>For those (probably very few) who noticed, the movie actually started on a quiet, pensive note - a few bars from Stephen Foster's languid Negro folk song Swanee River (Old Folks at Home). What comes next wakes you up. In a sort of prologue, Alec Baldwin in the form of a character called Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard, a white supremist, delivers an infuriating propaganda speech that make you feel completely disgusted. That is exactly the intention. The effect of this fictional opening is surpassed only by the real-life closing. But first, the main body of the story.<br/><br/>
Based on true events in the 1970s, the narration starts with Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), the first Black police officer in Colorado Spring Police Department, reporting to work on his first day. He soon gets bored with duties at the record library which is customarily assigned to rookies, irrespective of ethnic background. A bright young man brimming with self-confidence, he soon asks for a transfer to undercover assignments that are more challenging. ""I'll shave and even take out the natural if I have to"", the latter referring to his beautiful Afro hairstyle. It does not take too long for him to get his wish. Ron is teamed up with Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) and Jimmy Creek (Michael Buscemi), two worthy partners, for undercover assignments.<br/><br/>The fun starts when with a flash of inspiration upon noticing a add from an ""organization"" which he immediately recognizes as the Ku Klux Klan, he calls to seek membership. ""Fluent in both Queen's English and jive"" (the first one I interpret as meaning upper class American English, as real English hadn't been spoken in America for years, according to professor Higgins, ""My Fair Lady""), Ron spills out over the phone a run of insults a white supremist would hurl at a Black man. The hilarity from watching this on screen is predictable but still irresistible. The KKK member on the other end of the line is completely sold and invites Ron to an interview.<br/><br/>Doubling the hilarity now is having two Ron Stallworths, one in the voice of the real guy, the other in the body of Flip, who manages to achieve a good resemblance of the voice and manner of speaking, after some hard practice. He is white alright, but also a Jew! Imagine the danger he puts himself into in trying to infiltrate the KKK. But Flip, first and foremost, is a true professional.<br/><br/>There's more: the infiltration has a parallel. Ron goes to a black activist meeting, where he meets pretty student union president Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier). The ensuing mutual romantic interest is also predictable.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the narrative moves forward very much in the vein of a mainstream undercover yarn. The thriller portion is contained, culminating in an anticlimax of a bomb threat and an assassination attempt. The levity portion is well managed, with the barbs on bigotry working very much like those in ""Do the right thing"". There is even crowd-pleasing poetic justice in seeing a racist policeman trapped and getting his due.<br/><br/>Toward the end, however, comes a powerful montage of two parallel running, intercutting sequences. In one meeting, Jerome Turner (Harry Belafonte) recounts, first-hand, the atrocities done to his handicapped friend Jesse years ago. In another meeting chaired by David Duke (Topher Grace), the KKK ""grand wizard"", Flip gets ""baptized"".<br/><br/>The movie closes with ample live footage from the 2017 events in Charlottesville, include Donald Trump's comments. That completes the left-right combo knockout punch.<br/><br/>Washington's confident, measured performance does credit to his father Denzel. Driver get a well-deserved Supporting nomination in Oscar."

","BlacKkKlansman: A comedy but a very serious one. Director Spike Lee bookends this film with documentary footage, from the 60s at the beginning and ending with with 2017 footage of Neo-Nazis marching through Charlottesville chanting: ""The Jews Will Not Rule Over Us"" along with an interview with David Duke who features throughout the film.<br/><br/>Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) becomes the first Black undercover officer in the Colorado Police Force. Initially he is sent to infiltrate a meeting where a former Black Panther leader is speaking. Here we come to the first dichotomy: Stallworth very much wants to advance Black Power but he also believes in Law and Order, something which will cause divisions between him and student leader Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier) who he encounters at the rally.<br/><br/>Stallworth moves on to infiltrate the Klan, fooling both local Klan leaders and Imperial Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace) over the phone. His partner Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) takes the part of Ron in actual meetings. Gradually they get more involved in the Klan and uncover a plot to bomb Black targets. Duke may not have been aware of this, make your mind up.<br/><br/>Here we have a history lesson about some dark deeds in the recent past and as the ending shows: they haven't gone away you know. At the times it is only the vein of dark humour which runs through the film which makes it watchable. We come across not just racism but hatred of Jews with one character wanting to make Flip take a lie-detector test to prove that he's not a Jew. Zimmerman's life is constantly under threat through the risk of the exposure of his real identity. Serving members of the military are involved in the conspiracy. <br/><br/>There are racist cops in the film and it shows institutional racism in areas of Law Enforcement but Stallworth and Driver and eventually the Police Chief emerge as the heroes of the film. The identities of the villains are all to clear throughout BlacKkKlansman and they are still there at the post ending documentary coda. Made on a budget of only $15 million this is a tour de force by Spike Lee. 9/10."

","""With the right white man, we can do anything."" - Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) to Chief Bridges (Robert John Burke)<br/><br/>Potential spoilers below<br/><br/>The piano and wails of the late musician Prince in his 1983 cover of ""Mary Don't You Weep"" play over the credits to BlacKkKlansman, the latest film or ""joint"" by filmmaker Spike Lee. As with the late musician, Lee's career consists of a handful of underrated gems and many disappointing struggles to reattain the heights of his bona-fide masterpieces-1989's Do the Right Thing and 1992's Malcolm X. BlacKkKlansman, Lee's biographical drama about a most fascinating episode in the life of police officer Ron Stallworth, is a confident return to form for the 61-year-old stalwart of politically and racially charged cinema.<br/><br/>It is 1972. Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) joins the Colorado Springs Police Department as its first African-American detective. Feeling confident, Stallworth dares to infiltrate and expose the extremist and racist Ku Klux Klan (KKK) for conspiring to attack minorities. Stallworth teams up with his Jewish co-worker, Philip ""Flip"" Zimmerman (Adam Driver), to go undercover in the ""Organization"" (as Klan members refer to their group). Since the rookie detective made the mistake of using his own name, Zimmerman must also act and talk as Stallworth-a challenge, considering their racial backgrounds. Between cozying up to the Klan's ""Grand Wizard""/national director David Duke (Topher Grace) and his intent to sanitize its violent rhetoric to appeal to the mainstream and confronting their own cultural identities in the fight to eradicate hate, Stallworth and Zimmerman embark on the undercover investigation of their lives.<br/><br/>Despite the heavy weight and sensitivity of its subject matter, BlacKkKlansman's greatest asset is the noticeable joy that exudes from each frame and all the actors inhabiting them. Leading the way is former professional football player turned actor John David Washington, son of famed actor Denzel Washington. Washington interacts with many of his fellow cast members, transitioning between ""King's"" English and jive as the movie's embodiment the internal of tug o' war experienced by every American citizen of color, especially those of African descent. Though co-star Adam Driver's role is less flashy, he conveys just as well how Zimmerman's unpracticed Jewish heritage compels him to commit to investigating the KKK, which hates Jews about as much as those of African descent.<br/><br/>Beyond the leading duo are supporting players who vary between functional and noteworthy. Corey Hawkins gets an extended rousing speech and a brief police pullover scene as the Trinidadian Civil Rights and Pan-African activist Kwame Ture. Topher Grace gets just enough screentime as the affable David Duke, whose passion for the KKK's dark agenda matches his lack of awareness when having one-to-one phone conversations with Ron Stallworth. On the other hand, Laura Harrier (who last appeared in Spider-Man: Homecoming) could have used more scenes as Patrice Dumas, president of the local Black Student Union. Her forever-low view of the police as an institution does little to cover her standard role as Stallworth's love interest.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, two of BlacKkKlansman's secret weapons are cast members of European descent: Finish actor Jasper Pääkkönen gets to overuse his ""Jew radar"" as testy ""Organization"" member Felix Kendrickson. Kendrickson's interrogation of the undercover Zimmerman and whether he has been ""circumstanced"" registers as one of biographical drama's funniest scenes. Ashlie Atkinson plays Kendrickson's faithful wife Connie as an outsider adorably itching to participate in her husband's KKK activities. Both actors relish their characters' racism the most from among the cast. One can imagine Lee, Pääkkönen, and Atkinson having many laughs while discussing this acting choice between takes.<br/><br/>2018 has proved itself as a monumental year for films centered on those of African descent. I rank BlacKkKlansman just above Disney-Marvel's Black Panther (already the subgenre's representative for 2018), yet I ultimately prefer the innovative bonkers of Sorry to Bother You and the grounded conciseness of Blindspotting. Still, I hope BlacKkKlansman marks the official start of a bountiful autumn season in Spike Lee's storied filmmaking career.<br/><br/>Now, onward to the dance floor! ""It's too late / to turn back now / I believe, I believe, I believe I'm fallin' in love...""<br/><br/>(Parental Note: BlacKkKlansman has been rated R by the MPAA ""for language throughout, including racial epithets, and for disturbing/violent material and some sexual references"". It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for ""racist violence and language,"" and ""very strong language"".)<br/><br/>R.N.B."
"makleen2","6","5","9","20 August 2018"," An Ahistorical Dark Comedy
","An African-American police detective in 1970s Colorado Springs fights for acceptance at work while infiltrating the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan with help from his Jewish partner. Will he win the affection of a Colorado College activist and foil the KKK's violent schemes? Starring John David Washington, Adam Driver, and Laura Harrier, BlacKkKlansman (2018) was written and directed by Spike Lee, et al. While entertaining, it jettisons historical accuracy to score contemporary political points.<br/><br/>BlacKkKlansman was inspired by the book Black Klansman (2014) by Ron Stallworth. Stallworth was a police officer and detective in the Colorado Springs Police Department who in 1979 responded to an ad in the newspaper looking to start a local branch of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. With the help of a white officer posing as Stallworth at meetings, he successfully infiltrated the Klan for nine months. The Colorado Springs PD shut down the investigation after Stallworth was asked to lead the chapter, fearing word would get out that the police department had Klan affiliations.<br/><br/>Aside from a few incidents, like Stallworth speaking to David Duke (Grand Wizard of the KKKK) and having his picture taken with him, that's where the comparison parts ways. It turns out ""based on a true story"" is really ""inspired by true events."" The writers took many creative liberties to forward a cinematic narrative and spoon feed the audience an overtly political message.<br/><br/>Attacks on the film's accuracy have come from many corners. Sorry to Bother You (2018) director Boots Riley criticized Spike Lee for allegedly ..er.. whitewashing Ron Stallworth, turning him into a hero and downplaying his infiltration of black student organizations. ""It's a made up story in which the false parts of it try to make a cop the protagonist in the fight against racial oppression,"" he argued.<br/><br/>For his part, Spike Lee shrugged off any criticism about the historical accuracy of the film. He told SFGate, ""There isn't a film that's been made in the history of cinema where there hasn't been some embellishment. The title doesn't say, 'This is based on a true story.' The title says, 'This is based on for real, for real s-.'""<br/><br/>The problem with the film's accuracy isn't related to its entertainment value. There are plenty of entertaining and well-made films loosely based on real events (like The Nice Guys). The question is how much revisionism can audiences tolerate at the service of an overtly political message? BlacKkKlansman could've simply been a dark comedy about a weird and incredible invent in the history of U.S. law enforcement. Instead, it tried to make clear cut parallels between historic racism in the U.S., modern hate groups, and the election of Donald Trump in 2016.<br/><br/>If Spike Lee wanted to make a movie about racism in the 1970s and draw parallels to contemporary politics, why not dramatize the 1979 Greensboro massacre, in which KKK and American Nazi Party members killed five communist protesters? That parallels the 2017 riot in Charlottesville much more closely than anything that happened during Ron Stallworth's infiltration of the KKKK in Colorado Springs.<br/><br/>Was Spike Lee just trying to make parallels between racism in the 1970s and racism in the 2010s? Because he does that. A lot. He beats the audience over the head with it. Or is he criticizing identity politics as a whole by making a side by side comparison of black power activists and white power activists?<br/><br/>I got the impression the film's message was that standing around yelling at each other and threatening violence is not the way forward. At one point a jump cut shows both groups shouting their respective slogans (""black power!"" and ""white power!""). This is contrasted with the main character's chummy relationship with coworkers of different backgrounds. It took the cooperation of all members of the police department to foil the KKK's plot and root out a racist cop in their midst. This message will likely resonate with mainstream audiences but annoy activists like Boots Riley.<br/><br/>Overall, BlacKkKlansman had its moments but was a little too on the nose for my tastes. The acting among the lead cast was decent. John David Washington and Laura Harrier have some on-screen chemistry, but their relationship comes off as strictly Platonic. Topher Grace stole the show as race huckster David Duke. Steve Buscemi's brother, Michael, gives a surprise performance as Ron Stallworth's third wheel. I have a feeling who the viewer voted for in the 2016 presidential election will predict whether they like or hate this film."

","This film is a masterpiece, not in what it tells us about the KKK and the fact that white supremacists are nothing but neo-Nazis and neo-KKKlanners. We know all that. But it shows how racism is ingrained in American ""culture"", meaning ""white culture"" so deep that it will never be able to drop out completely. At the same time the film is just as clear as crystal about the fact that this racism, I mean anti-black racism, is just so ingrained in American ""black culture"" that it will never be able to be eradicated. Racism in white culture is about blacks being apes, chimpanzees, and gorillas, the impossibility to be truly free and superior as the white race as long as these black monsters will exist. The same racism in black culture is the belief that blacks are inferior and will never be equal, that they have to be subservient, obedient and submissive to the superiority of the whites, in short, that blacks are not even half human, they just are not human at all. Live with these two racisms when you are a black man in the white society of the USA.<br/><br/>The second thing you will love is that the language of the KKK in the 70s under Nixon is exactly the same as that of the white supremacists of Charlottesville, 2017. It centers on ""America first,"" ""make America great again,"" ""USA first"" and other ridiculous self-centered and self-locked-up white blindness about the world today and the future of today, not of a century ago, and even a century ago such motto would be absurd.<br/><br/>For the younger generation, it is a good way to discover what the Civil War was, from the Confederate side, what racism and segregation were all along till even today. The film is yet rather tame on the lynching episode. We get words, a description, and two or three black and white images, but the lynching itself is not shown like the cavalcade of Southern Klanners riding on their horses across the city and capture the black man they had decided to broil, grill, dismember, disembowel and hang, burn plus a few other things tonight. I guess that is not possible on a film from Hollywood if the film does not want to be X-rated.<br/><br/>But what's left after that? A vision of the rhetoric of the Black Panthers via Stokely Carmichael, aka Kwame Ture, two or three mentions of Angela Davis (who I met in 1973 in Davis California), some development on the black revolution that was announced by the Black Panther Party leaders at the time, a small book entitled ""Black is Beautiful"" going along with the mirror image of it under the title of ""White is beautiful."" The same way White Power is asserted by the KKK and just in continuation of it Black Power is asserted by the BPP. Things have changed even if some nostalgic people want to bring back those old days that have normally been buried with the defeat in Vietnam and subsequent decades. If you do not believe it has, just listen to Barack Obama in Obama ANTI-TRUMP Speech at EXPLOSIVE Rally in Gary, Indiana, on YouTube. Things have changed because no matter what the white nationalists and white supremacists lost in the bogs of nostalgia may think, the 44th president of the USA was black and he was in the White House from 2009 to 2017. That has changed the texture of the USA and that new texture cannot be changed, even by the worst liar of any time<br/><br/>But keep in mind the KKK shown in this film is at the end of its existence, of its lifespan. Other films about what it was in the 1950s and 1960s like Mississippi Burning would show the real horror of what it was then before the Civil Rights movement led by Martin Luther King marched onto Washington DC. That was the nightmare that prompted the dream of MLK and that dream was also the American dream, even if slightly more colorful than the traditional dream of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant supremacists who were and still are now and then aggressive hornets more than plain domestic wasps.<br/><br/>Enjoy the vision of the nightmare made scary again in Charlottesville.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

"gortx","Null","9","20","14 August 2018"," Very much SPIKE LEE's take on Ron Stallworth's amazing true story
","Despite being based on a true story, and having three other credited screenwriters (plus, a book), this is very much SPIKE LEE's Blackkklansman (note also the added K which is not on the book). The basics of detective Ron Stallworth's memoir are still at play. Detective Stallworth (John David Washington) was the first black office hired in Colorado Springs in the 1970s. Stallworth did ""join"" the KKK and carried on conversations with them. When the time came for a face-to-face meeting, a white officer here called Zimmerman (played by Adam Driver; although the real Stallworth has kept his true identity secret). Together they infiltrated the local Klan and helped foil some of their racist deeds. Spike Lee does a decent job with the main storyline, although, it can come off as a bit dry and overlong. <br/><br/>Clearly, the mundane details didn't engage Lee's filmmaking juices. So, with the other screenwriters, the story is embellished. Stallworth's girlfriend Patrice (Laura Harrier) isn't just a local, but, now she's the head of the local Black Student Union - and, ta da! -- now a chief target of the local KKK. Zimmerman isn't just white, he's now also Jewish - AND, has problems with his identity as such. There isn't just racism in the police force, but, there's also a singularly hateful specimen named Landers (Frederick Weller) who is ripe for a comeuppance. Astonishingly, the most ""unbelievable"" part of the film is actually TRUE -- Stallworth did strike up a correspondence with KKK Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace; excellent) AND did get assigned to protect the bigot when he came to town! Nobody expects to see a Documentary when you go to a Hollywood treatment of a true story, and every viewer will have to decide for themselves if and/or to what extent the liberties taken here go too far. Most are somewhat understandable, but one is kind of a head-scratcher -- moving the story from 1979 to 1972. Stokely Carmichael (aka Kwame Ture)'s speech in town was in '72 and , yes, Stallworth did cover it as a cop. Perhaps, Spike also wanted to set the story closer to the 60s civil right protests, the height of the Black Panthers and to include his fun tribute to Blaxploitation cinema (although, it renders references to COFFY and CLEOPATRA JONES as anachronisms since they came out a year later)? <br/><br/>BLACKKKLANSMAN still stirs. It's full of Spike's righteous anger and that clearly inspired him. Some of the Spike-isms go a bit far with the lampooning of the local KKK members as Southern Style racist goons (you'd swear those characters were 'imported' from David Duke's South into the Midwestern Colorado locale). He also can't help but take a virtual highlighting marker to references to President Trump -- and, that's AFTER said references were already underlined, to boot (the word ""subtle"" is rarely mentioned in the same sentence with""Spike Lee""). The cross-cutting of the Klan watching BIRTH OF A NATION with a talk by Harry Belafonte (grand) is powerful if far too long. <br/><br/>The acting is across the board fine, but Adam Driver falls flat. Driver has been solid in pictures like PATERSON and WHILE WE'RE YOUNG, but, as in the Star Wars films he can fall into a dull monotone. It's also hard to believe that the Klansman would take him in as one of their own. He simply doesn't pass the Redneck test (fellow cop Jimmy (Michael Buscemi) would have been far more credible. The cinematography by Chayse Irvin (on 35mm film, which does give it a gritty 70s feel) is quite good. Terence Blanchard's score is adequate, but the soundtrack is carried by the period songs. <br/><br/>Released the same weekend as the anniversary of the white supremacists killing of civil rights protester Heather Hyer gives BLACKKKLANSMAN yet another contemporary resonance. The actual footage of which may have been more appropriate after the closing credits, but, that's a quibble. It's a powerful coda to a very angry, if inconsistent, film."

The movie appeared to have a lot of life to it and at the heart a great chemistry between John David Washington and Adam Driver, both of whom I am huge fans of. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie was a really disappointing film that buried a really engaging story into a piece of propaganda with the intention of turning blacks against whites.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a decent rating because the strong parts are great, but we didn't get enough of them. As expected, Driver and Washington's chemistry was top notch, making me think and laugh time and time again. Even the side characters such as the other members of the police department added a fun, comedic element to the movie. The investigation was down well, but not enough of the focus was on it. Spike Lee took a really interesting story that I had never heard before and surrounded it with plain old bias.<br/><br/>My political views aside, all audience members, black, white... Christian, Muslim... Liberal or Conservative... should be able to join together at the movies to enjoy a film. However, as a white male, I felt like I shouldn't have been in the theater and no movie should make its audience feel that way. Film is an art and a form of expression, but it is also something that people are meant to enjoy and cherish with others. This film fails to capture all audiences but one. <br/><br/>Multiple political jokes and nods against the current administration in a movie set in the 70s felt jarring and took me out of it. Not to mention the forced propaganda placed at the end of the film, which did everything but straight up encourage a race war. <br/><br/>I wanted to love this movie. To me it doesn't matter what color skin or what religion an actor or actors is when determine which movies I see.

And please note that the majority of the reviews that are bad state that they hated the movie because it was a leftist movie aimed at Trump. I saw the movie as a reminder of where we have come and of where we are now. And a fair assessment of both."

","I don't generally liked Spike Lee films; I find them often overstuffed and inaccessible. They come across to me as if Lee is trying to say too many things at once.<br/><br/>However, BlacKkKlansman (while still having these features) is easily my favorite film by Lee and I hope it does very well on the award circuit. The screenplay's handling of the story is 2018 in its tragicomic tone. There are a ton of scenes that I swear I am going to laugh the next time I watch instead of crying this time. It brilliantly leaves a lot of tensions unresolved about how people should respond to systemic racism. Lee's visual flourishes work for once and the (mild spoiler) Birth of the Nation/Lynching story scene is some of the best editing I have seen since ROTK's Charge of Faramir. That sequence captures the damnable interplay of rhetoric/media and systemic racism perfectly.<br/><br/>Washington gives quite an understated performance that I think really works ironically for the tone of the film. Driver is just memorizing as Flip. But to me the real standout is Topher Grace as David Duke. I don't know if if it is casting or acting but that choice and performance is 2018 in a nutshell. Tragicomic made flesh.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this film. That ending is a gut punch."

","Hey, Spike Lee made a whacky film about a black cop going undercover as a Klansman... This is going to be a great romp!<br/><br/>Well... It is quite a ride. But if you're expecting something out of Django Unchanged's Klansman sequence, you may be dissapointed. At first. But what we got instead was well worth the time. Even though our black hero never actually dons the robes himself.<br/><br/>From the use of old film classics where the underlying racism is apparent to the speeches of white supremacists from all over the spectrum we do get kind of an unflinching view of their beliefs and convictions. But it does get to balance things with the Black Power movement as well. Showing that neither side are as productive as they claim, allthough, the weight is heavier on the white power side throughout, as in real life. The black side talks about revolutions... The klansmen are the guys who actually takes to violence. Harassment and violence is very much directed at the black for no good reason.<br/><br/>So while Spike does no attempt at hiding the political agenda (blatant references to modern politics abound). He is presenting a playground that is a little grey at the first glance. But by the time the ending montage rolls it's hard to have any sympathy for the Klan and its followers.<br/><br/>The films biggest downside is that being so blatant it'll probably alienate the crowd who really needs the b___h-slap the film provides. Does that make the film bas in itself? No. The pro equality movements needs reminders too.<br/><br/>Just don't expect a blaxploitation romp. You need a more open mind than that. It is entertaining though, so still watch it! :)"

","I love Spike Lee sarcasm. His realistic point of view truly amazes me every time I watch a work of his.
He always vouches for black community however, including the villains, degenerates and the oppressors in the public take place in his picture without harsh denunciations. On the contrary, all his characters appear in his movies with the idea of ""we are all human after all."" Thus, this naturalism is always giving the audience the message of ""It's useless and the most ridiculous thing to fight each other in a racist perspective, or a in religious diversity especially in the U.S.A where the multiculturalism has been living since in its origins"".
BlacKkKlansman as in its double party plot which the audience sees the inner circle of the kkk and the Black Civil Right group, defends the idea I mentioned above. I think Spike Lee's anti-acute diversion picturization with his usual sarcasm he uses in both communities in his movies, demonstrates the sick parts of discrimination in a nation in a better way (Like in BlacKkklansman) rather than the hatred, violence and brutality are pictured.
In technical angle, the cinematography, mise en scene and the shooting smells like an auteur work as Lee has it with his many years experience in Hollywood and movie is perfect in total.
The story is very intriguing as it has savour of political matters, crime, action, drama and in some points humor.

","I really enjoyed this movie, Washington was so powerful and at the end when he was holding his head so high, It felt so well deserved. Driver was amazing and was very easily to relate to as, like most of us White Males today, showed no signs of racism. But watching it as late after release as I did (10/28/2019) it just feels like the Elite are digging up their old tricks to reinforce how righteous Democrats are today. These are old wounds being scratched at constantly, and I grow tired of it, I think many people feel the same way. It does put into perspective (for me anyway) the battle to resist The Rothschilds (the real reason us Jews where targeted), The UN/World Bank, and Globalism. And how they can reshape history in news/cinema to keep their tools for control relevant for over a hundred years....<br/><br/>Racism to me, does not exist, it is a weapon to divide us. As Ron so perfectly showed in the opening of the film, first impression is everything. And sadly their are more and more young people of all creeds being left to TV, Games, and The Internet instead of being raised ""The Right Way"". The way he presented himself, no one could find fault in that, nor would they, it's not the early/mid 1900's anymore, the whole World has changed... It might have been a big issue back in the day, but with mine and the three/four generations I'm seeing as I get older, it's only relevant when the news or Hollywood brings it up.<br/><br/>We are all human beings that decide who we are, even if our home is not perfect. Because we are blessed to live in America, and have the minds to do so. And in that sacred privilege, we are humbly united and bound in Union as Patriots and Brothers/Sisters. Be something good, that you can take pride in, not what the World tells you to be. That is what I take from this film, it was a truly inspiring Story."

And there were some excellent parts, such as the juxtaposition of the Klansmen watching ""Birth of a Nation"" while African-American students listened to a guest speaker who describe the horrors of lynching. The ""Why don't you wake up?"" scene was also good. But the movie needed better pacing. The first 20 minutes could have been condensed down to 5. We didn't need to hear the entire Stokely Carmichael speech, or watch Ron and Patrice dance together for an entire song. I kept thinking, ""and there were executives that worried that 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' would slow down 'The Wizard of Oz.' What would they think of this?"" Overall, I felt this movie would have been a lot better if the director was constrained to using only 98 minutes of film. There was just too much padding here."

the clan or ""the organisation"" at any point seems threatening, just a bunch of red neck hanging out. And although the perfomances are enjoyable, no actor tried to individualized their characters. Thus making an average movie too long for his own sake.

The film is true to life and inspired by a true story which opposes white power and black power. The action scenes whith guns are really realistics!
We can see scenes which are thought-provoking with the process registration for the new members.
We can hear poignant speeches by black supremacists who want to fight white power.

","I finally saw BlacKkKlansman at the theater. I really didn't know what to expect from the movie initially. The previews made it hard to tell if this was a comedy or a drama, plus Spike Lee has been slipping over the years. I'm happy to say I was incredibly impressed with this movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie follows an undercover police investigation into Klan activities along the way exploring elements of institutional discrimination, prejudice, and race relations. All the while the movie also offers a stark commentary on modern day racial violence and hostility. <br/><br/>The movie perfectly blends a serious drama with elements of dark humor to make a poignant and entertaining journey. The movie certainly has a message, but I never felt like it was preaching at you. At its center the movie remained a very well made, quirky, stylish, and thought-provoking film. <br/><br/>I will say the film could have used a bit of tightening near the end. There were so many strong ideas in the movie that the love interest interaction felt a bit unnecessary and rushed. <br/><br/>Acting wise the movie was great all-around. I wasn't aware of John David Washington before this film, but I will certainly look forward to seeing his future films. All around he managed to blend a mix of drama and comedy in is character while still keeping him human. Of course Adam Driver did a great job. He is quickly is becoming a must-watch actor in all of his roles.<br/><br/>I also have to mention how well this film was directed. Spike Lee has been hit-or-miss over the past few years but he really put his all into this film. The film was masterfully well-crafted which further helped to immerse you into the story and message regarding racism. This is Spike Lee's best film in years. This of course should be no surprise considering it was also produced by Jordan Peele coming off of his success from Get Out.<br/><br/>Overall I was immensely impressed with this movie. Not only was the plot interesting but it managed to combine a serious topic with dark humor in an entertaining manner. It is a very important film with a message that very much resonates with our current socio-political climate. I would recommend this film to pretty much everyone. A 9 out of 10."

","The BlacKkKlansman is one of the best movies I have ever seen. With an amazing story that will bring tears into your eyes. It has a great cast, an amazing score, and above all the cinemetography for the film was stunning. They brought a modern new feel with a twist of the past in how the 70s used to be with the effects and music. The blacKkKlansman is an amazing true story about the first black officer in Colorado, who goes undercover and joins the KKK, with his parter who is white and ends up being the face of the operation. His partner however is Jewish and shows a lot of conflict throughout the film. This movie shows the real brutality that the klan had at that time and also brought to light what has been going on recently in the US. If you are sensitive to vulgar language or racial slang however this movie may not be for you. Although I am Jewish myself, and certain scenes were really hard for me to watch, this movie had great humor in it that left me laughing my ass off, right before I was balling my eyes out. This movie made me feel more prideful of my heritage, and a new found rage to make things better within America. This film will make you laugh, cry, and hope for a better world.

"RforFilm","8","8","18","15 August 2018"," A truly bizarre story that really happened, BlacKkKlansman reveals how a black man managed to infiltrate the klan
","What can I say about the Klu Klux Klan that hasn't been said before? They're an awful group that only exists for the point of hurting people. This is a group that I don't like talking about as it's painfully obvious why everyone should have a problem with them. I'm still baffled that they even have a platform in 2018. The good news is that they are not popular, have been barred from most social media, and are met by an army of counter protesters when they march. The other good thing is that they are more bark then bite. That is except from the Charlottesville Unite the Right Rally in 2017, where one woman was killed in a vehicle ramming.<br/><br/>I won't deny that we still have racists, bigots and white supremacists. But I also won't deny that as people, we've done well in moving forward in blurring that line of intolerance. We're always going to have disagreements, but the further we go, the more we as people can experience more love then anger. I'm glad there aren't that many people dumb enough to be registered members of the Ku Klux Klan and if BlacKkKlansman shows anything, that they'll always have a negative image. <br/><br/>In 1972, Ron Stalworth (played by John David Washington) is the first black detective for the Colorado Springs police. Like a lot of places, he does face prejudice from fellow officers and is sent to records. When he stands his ground and request to go undercover, he's given an assignment to a black student union rally that's being held by Patrice Dumas (played by Laura Harrier). This goes well enough for him to be reassigned to intelligence. It's here where Ron places a call to the local president of the Ku Klux Klan and asks to join (given their on the phone, they have no idea he's black).<br/><br/>Though baffled by this, the chief agree to let Ron keep going, though someone has to go in Robert T. Nickerson his place. Detective Flip Zimmerman (played by Adam Driver) is thus tasked with meeting the Klan members to clarify his Caucasian race. While Flip continues to infiltrate the meetings to note whose in the group, Ron continues to make constant phone calls asking about upcoming events for potential attacks. At one point, he even talks to Grand Wizard of the Klan, David Duke (Played by Topher Grace).<br/><br/>I have to give director Spike Lee credit for creating a lot of style in BlacKkKlansman. Though this could have easily been presented as a typical, Oscar-style drama. Instead, BlacKkKlansman is more of a comedic, Blaxploitation film that you'd expect out of the seventies. This could fit well along with Shaft, Cleopatra, and Superfly (there's a great moment where those movies are brought up for a discussion about black cops). The film's subject matter is still serious, but given that you see some of these characters have fun with the ridiculous setup that was a real investigation (the real Ron Stalworth even wrote the novel that was the basis).<br/><br/>Though he doesn't look much like his father Denzel Washington, John Davis Washington does contain that same charisma. While he does also carry that fear that the Klan could kill his friend Adam Driver, he has a confidence that lets him have enough that he's having as much fun as we are. The movie's focus on his struggle between inequality and maintaining the image of the police is fascinating. Yes, he has degenerates that make fun of him and a girlfriend whose convinced that all cops are bad, but he never lets any of the ideology get in the way of his goal.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie come whenever Ron has to phone in and interact with members of the Klan or David Duke. It's comedic goal to see a group of people that hate a race only to be blindsided by a black man who takes this in complete joy. It's something I haven't seen since Cleavon Little in Blazing Saddles. If there was anything to criticize is the ending montage that pays tribute to the victims of the Charlottesville attack. Not that I don't disagree with that, but given how the film already has an ending with the main characters and their continuing fight against prejudice, this seems tacked on and forced, as it's dramatic dark tone doesn't match the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight Klan hoods out of five. This film isn't looking to take sides of a political spectrum, but rather present a historical event with a comedic tone. If the movie trailer didn't persuade you, then your not going to like this. I had fun and I think a lot of people will too. Join the group of movie fans and go see this."

There really was a young, ambitious (if overconfident) African American cop who on a lark, out of boredom responded to a classified ad from the KKK which lead to an undercover investigation with his white colleague being his face for the Clan. But they made everything too black and white, no pun intended. White people are either extremely racist or anti-racist.

And the character's goal is exactly that.<br/><br/>I love how they do kind of a parallel between Drive's character and Ron (with in the beginning one ""defending"" that one of the orgs - the black one and the KKK - ""weren't that bad""), you see kind of example in how sometimes, we can do wrong judgements, because certain group is ""similar"" to us in some capacity (in this case, the skin color). Also talking about parallels, one of the most powerful scenes in the entire movie is the one they intercut between the KKK reunion, and the black power group reunion, the story which is told, is sad, but powerful, is at this point you start to be angry/scared until the end of it.<br/><br/>The scene where they are watching The Birth of a Nation is incredible, and specially for me, I've never thought about the movie from this point of view (I thought more about all the technical innovations it brought to the screen), it gave KKK the power they had lost again. Yeah, screw that, screw you D.W. Griffith, you're jerk.<br/><br/>The end is strong, is powerful, and it's majorly scary. It scares me (even though I'm not black) to see how dangerous the world can be, how hateful people can be, how distorted beliefs could transform a neighbourhood, a city, a state, a country... in a war zone. And most of all, how bad leaders, elected by people who mainly think about politics once every 2 years, could bring everything together. No, KKK members are not ""fine people"", it's about give more power to ""one side"" (whatever this may be), equality is about giving everyone the same amount of power/voice. KKK is not this, it's a bunch of white privileged racist jerks, that want to prove some dumb point.<br/><br/>A last couple of things about the plot thought, that may be the only bad things I can think about the movie:
In the speech scene the editing is weird, they cut to a lot of faces in a black background, I thought it was odd, and they did it several times.
He just starts an investigation by... calling? I mean, he saw an advertise ""ok, I think I'll give it a shot"", really? I know it's hard to talk about those specific things in a ""based on a true story"" movie, but anyways.
Someone (from the police) puts him inside a KKK EVENT? How bad were that cops supposed to be? Are you putting your only black cop to be a security man in an event with a lot of extremist racists?<br/><br/>To wrap up, BlacKkKlansman is a fantastic movie, which approaches a truly complex and important subject that must not be ignore in recent days. We must talk about it.<br/><br/>9,5/10"
"jeronimocamarena","3","5","10","5 February 2019"," Bad movie with many things that didn't make sense.
","This is a bad movie based on an incredible story. The topic of the movie is important to talk about and is relevant to today, but that still does not change the fact that it was a bad movie. With slow pace, forgettable villains and just a bunch of nonsense that makes it imposible to believe that this is how the true story happen.<br/><br/>1. What was the whole point of showing the black panthers speeches and rallies?.
The movie was about two guy infiltrating the kkk. The whole part of the black panthers felt like irrelevant and prolong the story of the movie. Yeah sure at the end there was a cool scene where black panthers are yelling black power and the kkk white power, but there was no payoff to this. The whole thing just disappears at the end making it irrelevant.<br/><br/>2. The way the plot starts seems like a joke.
Ron Stallworth just calls the kkk on the phone and gets an interview. Once that flip has infiltrated, they find no information that points that the kkk are up to something other than just mentions of hitting African American people. Ron Stallworth has the authority to continue the investigation on just a hunch even though at the beginning of the movie at the black panther rally he literally hears that the race war is about to start soon and he dismisses it as just talk.<br/><br/>3. Numerous things not adding up.
Why where there two Ron Stallworth? maybe in the real story there was a motive, but I saw none in the movie. Why was Ron Stallworth, the first african american cop of colorado springs, asked to be the personal guard of the kkk? the chief explained that he had no one else to ask but come on!! Do you seriously believe something like that could happen? Ron Stallworth was busy but the chief took him out of the assignment to do this instead. He could have asked another busy cop instead of jeopardizing the entire investigation. Once Felix finds out that Ron Stallworth is a cop, why does he continue with the plot and more importantly why does he hand the bomb at the conference for the real Ron Stallworth to see? Felix's wife was supposed to have the detonator? that was why a previous scene showed a guy explaining her how to use it and why Felix didn't need to leave the conference until she called him. This makes the ending stupid since Felix blows himself up with the detonator.<br/><br/>A lot of other things didn't make sense but I got tired of listing them, it was a terrible movie wrapped around an important topic that forces you into accepting the movie, but in the end. Bad movie."

I'm a tree-hugging liberal and really wanted to like this movie but I have to say that I didn't. Got worn down by the polemicist in Spike Lee. As a screenwriter, I can't get a job, but I worked for years honing my skills. In this movie, you can see the hands of the writer and director imposing their views on everything and everyone. Didactic and much too ""on the nose."" The sound mix is so uneven. Music is much louder than conversation. Had to constantly adjust the sound level on my DVD.
This story could have been so much better with a more organic script and a lighter touch on the directing. It seemed ridiculous that our hero would dates a woman many times and not only does sex not happen, they don't even think about it. Never comes up."

","I sit across the fence (border) from America, and do my best to avoid Americana movies that expose the wretchedness of the human condition.

It seems, rather hypocritically of me, that America 'owns' every conceivable nightmare imaginable. Yet, I find myself, yet again, surprised by the depths we plumb. This may be just another movie on the struggle of racial equality and horrors observed, but Spike Lee manages to wrap it up in a story, that seems patently absurd and tacitly comedic. The silliness and stupidity of folks will never wash away humanities failings. Yet, is true, as non fiction movies go. I'm telling you, after watching this movie, I want to disown my membership card in the human race. The movie might take liberties with the truth, but not with reality. Weeks ago, I mistakenly passed over this movie because of the title. Best movie I've seen in some time.

He was focusing on things that were unimportant..

"BlackCinemaNow","8","5","10","30 November 2018"," Great film if you want to watch something informative and entertaining.
","Based on a true story, I watched the Spike Lee Joint Blackkklansman. The movie is about a black man played by John David Washington infiltrating the KKK. The movie starts with Washington's character Ron Stallworth being the first black officer hired to the police department in Colorado spring. He is later given the task of infiltrating the KKK and the Black Panther. He and his partner played by Adam driver becomes one person as Ron voices the Ron used to join the KKK and his partner plays the actual in-person Ron. It's interesting because they're both placed in a situation that may have comprised their loyalty to the police department and their case. Worth mentioning, there is a scene where Ron Stallworth is mentioning an officer on the force who killed an unarmed black kid and when asked why the force keeps him around he was told ""they're a family and we stick together, right or wrong, we stick together"" Ron replied ""that reminds me of another group"" if that doesn't make you think. I will say your ear will burn from the use of racial, ethnic and homophobic slurs so if you're sensitive you may want to consider not watching. The film was very entertaining and informative although it would have been nice to get some action movie type action; it wasn't that type of movie. I commend spike lee on retelling this story and putting that reality in art at the end.

"evanston_dad","9","6","13","30 November 2018"," A Movie for Our Times (Unfortunately)
","I broke my embargo of Spike Lee movies to see ""BlackkKlansman"" and was pleasantly surprised to discover one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>I had long ago decided Lee wasn't ever going to make another good movie (the last one being ""Do the Right Thing"" way back in the dark ages of 1989). His movies have always been angry, which isn't what bothers me, since he has a lot to be angry about. But they've been hectoring and preachy, hammering away at the same point over and over with a sledgehammer. They've alienated me, not with what they have to say, but with how they've said it. But ""BlackkKlansman"" gives us a more mature, nuanced Spike Lee, one who's not so much angry (though he's still that) as much as he's sad and tired that a story set in the early 1970s has as much to say about our country now as it did then. Oh how far we haven't come.<br/><br/>""BlackkKlansman"" is perfectly timed. It's the best movie I've seen yet that captures the disbelief people like me feel that white supremacy can still be so predominant in our culture. It's funny, but its comedy has teeth. And though some may feel Lee overplays his hand at the end by bringing in real footage of recent events and our dear national leader, I think he's saying things that need to be not just said, but screamed from the mountaintops.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","'BLACKKKLANSMAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Spike Lee's new biographical crime-drama about an African American police officer who infiltrated the Klu Klux Klan, with the help of a white officer, in the 1970s Colorado Springs. It was directed by Lee, and written by Lee, Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz and Kevin Willmott. It's based on the memoir by Ron Stallworth. The movie stars John David Washington, Adam Driver, Laura Harrier, Topher Grace, Jasper Paakkone, Ryan Eggold and Michael Buscemi. It was also co-produced by Jordan Peele. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's a hit at the Box Office as well. I loved it, and I think it's Spike Lee's best movie to date, as well as one of the best films of the year. It's a really well made cop buddy flick, as well as a great dramatic study of interracial relationships (throughout history). It's also got a little Tarantinoesque vibe going for it the entire time too. I found it immensely entertaining, as well as really emotionally powerful (I even teared up a little in the end) and insightful. It's a must see!"
"st-shot","3","8","19","5 December 2018"," Lee's Black privilege fails to disguise heavy hand.
","Spike Lee gets his shots in at the Klan in this lumbering repetitive tale of a black detective infiltrating the organization in BlacKkKlansman. One shot however is in his foot as he exposes himself for what he condemns.<br/><br/>
Dan Stallworth is hired by the mostly lily white Colorado Springs Police Department where he chafes at the smug bias of officers in the records room. He requests a switch to detectives where he is given assignments to infiltrate the Black Panthers and KKK which finds him a love interest and getting up close with grand wizard David Duke, acting as his bodyguard during a visit. Eventually the dim witted Klan members put things together and plan a big hurt for Stallworth and his politically woke squeeze.<br/><br/>
Poorly paced, haphazardly edited, Lee loosely attaches the plots of his storyline together without much rhythm or energy, his players (with the exception of some of his moronic goobers) lifeless dullards of sober demeanor that make every pregnant pause overdue. The entire cast looks like it could use some rest.<br/><br/>
There are attempts by Lee to be au courant hip (it's Saturday Night's Live's Alec Baldwin! And how bout that title? ) and address today's racial tension with current news footage perhaps attempt to elevate this banal film's gravitas. But it cannot hide Lee's lifelong problem with pacing, packed on mostly with insipid dialogue and sermonizing displayed in abundance here with Lee's heavy handed juxtaposition.<br/><br/>Most revealing is Spike's handling of scenes from Birth of a Nation with its vile representation of virulent racist black faced northern pillagers. Given the absolute clueless imbeciles of the Klan and the casual bigotry of the boys in blue he presents in his film one might suggest Mr. Griffith has taught him well. A shame DW's artistic style never rubbed off on him. BlackkKlansman is a rambling bore."

","So, I went to the cinema with my English class with some expectations. I had heard that this was a great movie, a must-see movie. And that was great! I thought the story would be centered on Ron Stallworth (J.D Washington), turns out it was not. Despite some harsh critics, we also get the supremacists point of view, AND, also follow Flip, his Jewish colleague (Adam Driver) whose story and role throughout the movie is just as important as Ron's. The film really succeeded in incorporating humor in a serious subject and I don't remember one joke being misplaced. The actors are convincing, their performance is really spot on and they give a very realistic vibe. The soundtrack is great, it really gives a specific vibe during some scenes. I won't focus on the historic part because, the film being based on a true story, it's not something I can judge. Or at least, I don't feel like it's my place. However, it gets a bit long toward the end and as interesting as the movie may be, there was a moment when I wanted the story to end. But the unexpected true videos make you realise this isn't just a ""funny"" story, but real events that took place with real bad people and not some movie villains.
It reminds you that despite everyone saying things have changed, racisms is still very present and truly not so much has changed. It's a really moving ending and I didn't quite know how to feel after having seen all of that. That's the reason why I encourage you to go see that movie. I won't say I strongly recommend it, or that it is an incredible movie, but this is moving, and enjoyable. I think that is what you ask for when you go to the cinema, so it's worth seeing."

There is genuine humor in the premise of a black man pulling the rug over white supremicists, and the plot lines hold together reasonably well. The actors did their jobs well. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, the bias of the producers, OR the writers, OR the director, OR someone, caused the film to become a blatant activist propaganda flick. It is a shame, as this movie played straight without the political leverage at the end had the fundamentals of a very good movie. There is enough political BS in this country without subverting a film to try to shape public opinion, and I am more than a little saddened by the effort and result of this manipulation. In retrospect, it is not a surprise that the movie was so poorly attended. What could have been a seismic historical effort with humor, becomes instead a treatise on the art of flim-flam.

It's a testament to the talent in front and behind the camera that allowed this to be hilarious yet infuriating at the same time. I also enjoyed how this wasn't so brutally violent like movies with this similar theme tend to be.
I only had a few criticisms with this: Patrice's character was a little unnecessary (except at the end) and I wish we had gotten to know the lead characters a little more (like it took no time for Ron to lead an investigation or for Flip to follow his lead). In conclusion, this is a must see because the actors do such a great job especially Driver (I just continue to love his acting), John sounded so much like his father in certain scenes (it's a little scary).

","Finally director Spike Lee is being nominated for an Oscar for this troubling film based on a true story. The film is based on Ron Stallworth's book about his experience with the Colorado Ku Klux Klan and the reenactment of the story is very well presented, despite the gut-wrenching events it relates.<br/><br/>In the early 1970s, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington, son of Denzel Washington) is hired as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs, Colorado police department. Stallworth is initially assigned to work in the records room, where he faces racial slurs from his coworker Andy Landers (Frederick Welller). Stallworth requests a transfer to go undercover, convinces his Jewish colleague (Adam Driver) to go undercover as a surrogate white supremacist, and is assigned to infiltrate a local rally at which national civil rights leader Kwame Ture (birth name Stokely Carmichael - portrayed by Corey Hawkins) is to give a speech. At the rally, Stallworth meets Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of the black student union at Colorado College. While taking Ture to his hotel, Patrice is stopped by patrolman Andy Landers, a corrupt, racist officer in Stallworth's precinct, who threatens Ture and sexually assaults Patrice.<br/><br/>The plot rambles a bit to include a terrifying overture of Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard (Alec Baldwin) offering history and a racist tirade, the influence of David Duke (Topher Grace), and Klansmen Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold), Felix Kendrickson (Jasper Pääkkönen) and his wife Connie (Ashlie Atkinson) and Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser), and ends with the 2017 Charlottesville riots (actual footage) with neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching the streets, and some disturbing moments from Donald Trump and the real David Duke.<br/><br/>Tough to watch but important to see."

I think the acting could have been a little bit better, especially the love story between the officer and the Black Panther president... I wanted to feel Dead Presidents vibes.

It overly relies on movie tropes and stereotypes, has many many errors in the screenplay and the internal logic of the film, unresolved plot lines, and overall sloppy and confused messaging.

It has some great comedy that mixed in with a serious situation as well. Even at times when the scenes were intense it could be funny. The real shame it all is how Spike Lee added these edited clips of Trump at the end to present the idea that Trump is a racist. It's a shame to lie about people and take things out of context to try to ruin someone at the end of what was otherwise a really good film. It just ruined it for me.

"carvalh_3","2","6","14","17 November 2018"," No depth or professionalism in the development of the story
","So, when the first black speech scene started I began to worry about being about to watch a film that was going to feel unrealistic and shallow. And it was. None of it felt professional or smart. How on earth are people supposed to believe that they can talk on the phone with someone and in person with a different man for months and not tell the difference? Not even actors can achieve that, but these cops pulled it through? It seems that in Spike Lee's imaginary world people can't put 2 and 2 together. That happened with every storyline in the film. Even with all the mistakes the cops make in their case, no one finds out it's all a mission. The characters didn't feel believable either.<br/><br/>However, my biggest problem with the film is that so many interesting storylines never went anywhere. What was the point of the first Alec Baldwin part? How did it connect with the story? Never got resolved. The guy started working in the files, but he got nothing from that experience. He was a cop lying to a girl he was going to fall in love with, but the conflict never went anywhere, they never discovered enything interesting or relevant from one another. That relationship in fact happened too easily and with no conflict in spite of all the lies it was built on. What was the point of showing Flip's exceptional shooting skills? Never used that for anything. The racist cop went to jail for being a jerk? And got discovered in a party where everyone was wired in a bar? Come on! The KKK local director stepped off the post for what reason? The post was just left empty? Why did Rob and the National Director of KKK become such good friends and why did he admire Rob when he never said anything too smart or did anything special for him? So is this story about little butter muffin or whatever the kid's name was supposed to mean he was that kid himself? His dad told him he couldn't play with the black kid. Not a great story, really. All the parts where you were expecting closure or surprise or any sort of wit, never went anywhere.<br/><br/>In general, the film doesn't add anything to what people think of the KKK or the black struggle of the... 70s (?)... What can one learn about the film? It shows the racist to be irrelevant and stupid, so why are they a threat to society, if all they do is meet at the bar and use the N word 100 times. The film missed the chance to show a real deep problem with racism.<br/><br/>As a political critique, this film embarrasses itself with nonsense stories and jokes that seem to be made by highschool students. I gave it 2 stars because of the amount of money they spent. Even the music was disappointing for a supposed ode to blackness."

People will be debating whether ANY AND EVERY incident of Urban Violence can be laid at BLACKKKLANSMAN's doorstep for decades to come. (I was passing through stressed-out Detroit, which is still trying to recover from its 1967-68 Race Riots, when BLACKKKLANSMAN came out. Since none of the suburban theaters on my itinerary--those multiple-screen Big Box Bijous catering to diverse audiences--would touch this flick with a 16-foot pole, I was forced to drive almost to EIGHT MILE road for my undercover viewing in a sector which the local newspaper pegs at a 98% Urban demographic.)

"williampsamuel","10","5","11","15 March 2019"," A Hilarious, Nostalgic, and Often Disquieting Comedy Masterpiece. May be Spike Lee's Best
","A black guy goes undercover in the Ku Klux Klan. Sounds like the setup of a joke. Or one hell of a comedy. And indeed it is. But more than just a hilarious comedy, Spike Lee's Blackkklansmen is also an excellent cop movie and a moving, surprisingly nuanced statement on race in America.<br/><br/>For much of its runtime Blackkklansmen is an engaging, frequently tense police procedural in which careful police work and a knack for thinking on their feet allows the protagonists to worm their way into the Klan. But when it switches gears and goes for laughs it's absolutely hysterical. The phone calls with the Klan feel like sitting in on history's greatest crank calls, and this movie can even turn a racially motivated bombing into an over the top farce. Plus there's even a charming love story that doesn't feel forced or tacked on.<br/><br/>Lee has a real gift for editing and composition. I wouldn't have expected a speech by a former Black Panther to be one of the high points of the movie, but the masterful cinematography gave it a power on par with Capra.<br/><br/>John D Washington and Adam Driver have excellent chemistry as officers Ron Stallworth and 'Flip' Zimmerman; Washington brings an over the top swagger and perfect comedic timing while Driver remains absolutely deadpan no matter how ridiculous the situation. Topher Grace is wonderful as a surprisingly unassuming, mild mannered, and rather nervous David Duke. For a racist demagogue he's a pretty likeable guy.<br/><br/>The period touches are pervasive and coupled with a heavy helping of warm nostalgia. Between the clothes, the hair, and the soundtrack, it's like stepping back into the age of jive.<br/><br/>Of course some historical liberties have been taken to liven things up. In real life the Klan never detonated or even completed a bomb, nor did they ever suspect they'd been infiltrated until well after the investigation was completed. I can't vouch for the accuracy of the romantic sublot either. But yes, a black guy really did go undercover in the KKK, he really did have multiple lengthy conversations with David Duke, and it was every bit as funny as depicted here.<br/><br/>If this movie has a weakness, it's some overly obvious references to the current president. It's one thing for David Duke to say that the Klan is trying to make America great again. It's another for a room full of people to chant ""America First!"" at length, particularly given that this was not a Klan slogan at the time. The ending is also kind of a downer, but I suppose we live in fraught times, and it wouldn't be a Spike Lee movie if there wasn't a little grandstanding.<br/><br/>It's a shame more of his movies don't turn out this good."

","Nice to see Alec Baldwin play two racists very well: in this movie and as the president on Saturday Night Live.<br/><br/>And BlacKkKlansman truly shows the connection between the two.<br/><br/>In probably Spike Lee's best film, this gorgeously shot, wonderfully paced, often hilarious and definitely, superiorly acted movie is deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. Now, I haven't seen all of the films nominated for 2018, but I can say: if this wins, we all win.<br/><br/>The OBVIOUS son of Denzel Washington poses as KKK-inductee over the phone and sends the Star Wars, black-dressed white man to infiltrate the terrible, racist group in the 1970s. The wonderfulness of this movie is trying to keep ahead and aligned with the lies of the cops and their undercover work and relationships.<br/><br/>Truthfully, like Natalie Portman in the Star Wars sequels, I'm not a fan of Adam Driver in the latest trilogy. That said, since I've seen him elsewhere, as in this and Logan Lucky, I'm totally on the Driver-Train. He was as real as you could be in this.<br/><br/>Now, that's not discounting the excellent job the rest of the cast did. I liked everyone in this. I definitely liked the idiots who ran the klan in Colorado. Nothing feels better than to see such hate get punished.<br/><br/>Washington really drives this project and it's hard not to root for him the whole way. Just too bad his character didn't stop the entire race of hate. The movie's final shots literally had me in tears and my eyes red...from both crying and anger towards this group.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. And I'd like to see more of the pain this disgusting group brought upon themselves.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: If only this movie wasn't based on a true story.

His obvious blackness means he can't meet them in person but he works in tandem with a Jewish cop to infiltrate KKK intelligence. Lee draws obvious parallels with Trump's modern day America - not least when showing footage of the Charlottesville race riots of last year. 8 out of ten"

","Spike Lee is one of those directors that I like, though not perhaps one that I laud as I would others. He has made many films that I have enjoyed - indeed one of my all time favourites in ""Do the Right Thing"" - though while interesting, innovative and always politically-charged in his work, his films tend to be flawed in some way or other. Having said that, apart from 2013's misguided ""Old Boy"" re-make, I can't say any of his films haven't been worth my time. <br/><br/>It would also be fair to say, however, that like many other directors, as his career has got longer, his body of work has become less impactful. With much of his work over the last decade coming in the form of TV, documentary and music video, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a welcome return to feature film form delivering his best film for many years. <br/><br/>Based on, but moving away from, his memoir, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is the first black police officer on the Colorado Springs force. Left in archives, however, his uniqueness on the force see him used for undercover purposes to make sure a student rally doesn't get ""out of hand."" This taste of active police work sees him quickly moved to Intelligence, where apropos of nothing, he calls the local branch of the ""Organisation"" (the Ku Klux Klan to you and me) pretending to be a harmless white racist, eager to join. Discussions developing, the head of the Colorado Springs branch is keen to meet. <br/><br/>There is just one problem with that. <br/><br/>Enter fellow undercover Flip Zimmerman (face-seen-a-lot-these-days Adam Driver). With Stallworth the voice and Zimmerman the face, they create an alter-ego Klan member Ron Stallworth. Gaining further trust, they soon gain recognition within the Klan at a national level. As such, they soon uncover a secret plot among some members against student groups.<br/><br/>As the scenario suggests, there is something of a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour throughout ""BlacKkKlansman"". Stallworth able to convince members of the Klan that his is the voice of a white man, much to the amusement of his colleagues, particularly when making the rookie mistake of using his actual name and address. Sending a Jewish man to play the face also leads to numerous references to showing his penis to prove his whiteness (and not just with how small it is). As ever with Lee, political rhetoric comes with a sense of humour. <br/><br/>But there are more political messages - attempts at least. Stallworth, as the sole black police officer, sees himself as a pioneer, while his relationship with student activist Patrice (Laura Harrier) throws questions at him as to how a black man can ever work for a racist police force. But why can't he be both a police officer and proud black man? Zimmerman is a man who doesn't define himself by his Jewish heritage, but once spending time with the Klansmen, he soon becomes more aware of white society's views towards him. These are perhaps left unexplored to a greater extent, with entertainment more of a key factor, as well as lampooning certain individuals. One gets the sense that Lee and his fellow writers, Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz and Kevin Willmot, are making not-so-subtle references to the current political situation in the US throughout. <br/><br/>And it is thrown square in your face on the film's conclusion. A seemingly Hollywood happy ending, with lives saved, victory achieved and knockabout goofs thrown in, the team are told to destroy all evidence of the case, much to their frustration. This is then followed by a literal barrage of now well-known video footage of cars ploughing into protestors, alongside speeches from Donald Trump and David Duke (featured at a younger age in the film). From the euphoria of cinema, we are brought straight back to reality in a brutal way, timed and measured for maximum impact: true images more shocking than any fiction. <br/><br/>Much more slick than his earlier films, there are still flaws here: perhaps an indulgent dance scene showing Lee's music video influence; and some plot holes that could use some covering - natural when fictionalising true events for entertainment. The more mainstream edge on show here - less radical than his works in the Eighties and Nineties - lead to criticisms as to the changing of the script and Lee's (lack of) showing the reality of what happened. Is the police ""racism"" Stallworth experienced shown as little more than childish name-calling here? Are the Klan members simply pantomime villains? Perhaps. Lee's recent work with the police to help improve minority relations could be seen as a motivation for some of the changes to story and character for a more positive outlook. <br/><br/>But the truth is this is a mainstream film - Lee a more recognised name in the industry than in his younger, more aggressive days - and Hollywood will always change the script in the name of entertainment. One cannot, therefore, be shocked by the lack of overall truth; and the choice for entertainment over education. For the merits of the film itself: Lee shows that he can still make feature films that cover the full range of making you laugh, cry, enjoy, rage and think. Your thoughts as to that though may not be so positive."

Films (and plays) are there to give experience, not to teach. The thing Lee avoided so elegantly in the past films is exam he fails so clearly in this one for one simple reason: in his best work it was never about teaching audience, but simply telling the story. This is what he does in first 1/3 of BlakcKkKlansman and when the movie is at its best with no pressure in ""making the point"". As soon as he tries to make one (in fact in moment when any director tries to make one) it starts to fall apart and falls into cliches he is trying to avoid. It starts with Trump miniatures in dialogues that seems as nice auteur expression at beginning, continues with inserting ""change the world"" parts in otherwise engaging dialogue (something director would say, not characters), Harry Belafonte giving monologue about African American suffering that seems so obligatory and culminates with Charlottesville footage, for all people who didn't watch the previous 98 minutes of movie.<br/><br/>Loosing respect for audience intelligence is one of the worst things that can happen to film director. He resembles parent who wishes to teach children by lecturing them, while children at same time crave for real life experience. It will not work for simple fact that we all have organic adversity of being programmed by other people. We are truly touched by other people's experiences that makes us think.<br/><br/>Ironically, but not illogically, Lee does his best with limited sources. I remember accidentally stumbling on Do The Right Thing on TV many years ago. I signed up for comedy, ended up with movie that stuck with me till today. All it tried to do is tell a simple story about hanging pictures in one pizzeria, and ended up telling story about human character, relationships and love. I kept thinking about it hours after it ended. BlackKkKlansman took different approach - it's more direct story that tries to be larger than life. I was doing my best to be touched, I honestly did, but there was nothing left for me to do since Lee did it all the thinking for me.<br/><br/>There is one thing I was left with, although not sure director did it intentionally. As I scrolled against the list of Oscar nominees for last couple of years I couldn't help noticing it was less and less about movies and more about political correctness. Let's be honest - Oscar never was about auteur cinema, but in most cases it had respect for quality that would stand the test of times. I hope that after it pays its due to all movies with agenda, it will turn to filmmakers in pursuit of telling the story. I cannot help myself thinking about Paul Thomas Anderson, caucasian middle aged auteur from San Francisco who usually tells interesting stories about ""ordinary"" people. It's just about character's lives and relationships, nothing more. It's something Spike Lee used to do.<br/><br/>There is parole in BlacksKkKlansman that says: All Power To All People! (which actually doesn't make a sense if you properly think about it). I propose another one: All Power To Story Telling Filmmakers!"

The duality of the man speaking about the lynching running concurrent with the initiation scene was a powerful moment, leading up to the bombing scene. I would have liked to have seen more of what transpired afterwards, if anything, but I understand that the movie itself had already conveyed the message that they set out to do and that nothing else was levy to be said.

","I watched this movie a short time after watching Do The Right Thing and while Blackkklansman is more optimistic, the parts of the movie that are not shots of real events ultimately are less powerful and pale in comparison both to the real events and Spike Lee's previous work.<br/><br/>Hearing the story of a black man being lynched is powerful, but it is a story inside a movie about a single black cop taking down obvious racists with the system working in his favor. It portrays racism as something clearcut (using the N-word, planning to blow up black people, calling neo-nazis good people), that can be destroyed by a single righteous black man who almost exclusively gets support from the white men around him. The movie tries to have a mouthpiece for the other side in Patrice, but she only says words and within the text is more or less wrong. Perhaps what we need is a more positive voice to rally behind but as a political piece it feels simple and bland. Unite and fight racism are good messages but they do not give much insight or guidance. <br/><br/>Not that it's a bad movie by any regard. The jokes are funny and the actors do an amazing job, even if the pacing's a little off. But Spike Lee already has told powerful stories and this is not one of them."

"samwillpearce","9","4","9","22 December 2019"," The kind of historical film we need
","""BlacKkKlansman"" is, I think, one of my favorite 'Based on a True Story' movies I've ever seen, and that's saying something. From fantastic performances to it's hilarious moments of attention-grabbing comedy to it's difficult and horrifying truths, ""BlacKkKlansman"" stands out because of just how raw and real it feels despite creative liberties taken with historical accuracy--and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>I could talk about the cinematography and the acting and the direction for a long time, but I'd rather discuss what makes this movie truly unique in my eyes: the message is prioritized above all else. Far too many historical movies get lost in the minutia of historical accuracy that they forget to remind us why this story matters. If too much energy is devoted to period accurate set and costumes, to keeping the story strictly within the time period, the message can easily get buried. Now, historical accuracy is by no means a bad thing, but in ""BlacKkKlansman""s case, it is less important than telling a story of white supremacy in the modern era, police violence, and solidarity between minority groups. Through John David Washington's Ron, Adam Driver's Flip, and Laura Harrier's Patrice, Spike Lee tells a tale of how each of these characters has a different role in combating white supremacy, and how none of them are less valuable than the others. The characters may disagree on methodology at times, but the film really portrays how much risk each of these people put themselves at to fight for their unified cause.<br/><br/>Three scenes really jump out to me in the way of overall tone and message. The first is the scene in which Kwame Ture is speaking to the Black Student Union. This scene is incredibly powerful because of how the faces of the crowd overlay the speech about black beauty and excellence. Secondly, Adam Driver's monologue about his own Jewish identity is extremely moving because he talks about how he used to never be fearful or uncomfortable about his own identity as a Jewish man, but ever since he entered the fight against white supremacy, he has begun to constantly think about his identity. This scene is particularly poignant because of how it expresses the dichotomy between being comfortable and somewhat complacent versus being uncomfortable and active. Lastly, the heartbreaking ending reminds the audience of just how relevant the issues presented in the film remain, and how little progress it feels like we've made. This scene makes it unequivocally clear the message Spike Lee is attempting to portray: we still have a long way to go, as a nation, and we must continue to fight white supremacy, because it still exists.<br/><br/>""BlacKkKlansman"" doesn't beat around the bush in telling the audience what is means; rather, it slaps the audience in the face with meaning. And that is exactly what we need right now. This movie exists to make its audience uncomfortable with the way our society is now, but it also inspires us to make a change. It is, without a doubt, one of my favorite historical films, and a film that everyone should see."

"zardoz-13","8","4","9","17 February 2019"," The Klan of Idiots
","Spike Lee's biggest release since ""Inside Man,"" ""BlackkKlansman"" is a low-key, undercover crime satire that defies credibility about a black Colorado Springs detective who subverted the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. Although Ron Stallworth (John David Washington of ""Book of Eli"") infiltrated the KKK, he had to arrange for one of his white police colleagues, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver of ""Lucky Logan""), to conduct all the personal, face-to-face, activities. Obviously, Ron couldn't masquerade in white-face and hope to pull this stunt off without getting lynched. Nothing about what Ron Stallworth achieved during his undercover activities amounted to anything spectacular in the long run. Basically, it is low-stakes all the way. However, the fact that Stallworth could dupe Grand Wizard David Duke and make asses out of the Klan distinguishes this routine, but entertaining yarn. Lee generates a modicum of suspense along the way when Flip must defuse a potential disaster after a KKK bomb specialist, Walker (Nicholas Turturro of ""Takers""), who he had arrested and who now plans to blow Flip's cover. Ultimately, two major things occur in this . First, David Duke (Topher Grace of ""Spider-Man 3"") converses with Ron via telephone and assures him that he sounds like a white man because he can pronounce the verb 'are.' Duke explains that African-Americans pronounce 'are' as 'are-uh.' During this explanation, Stallworth's superior, Sergeant Trapp (Ken Garito of ""Summer of Sam""), has to turn away because he has to laugh out loud. The hilarity that comes out of this is contagious as Duke genuinely believes that Ron is white. The more serious action concerns a bomb plot. Felix's devoted wife, Connie (Ashlie Atkinson of ""Bridge of Spies""), plants an explosive package containing C-4 on the Volkswagen car of African-American activist, Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming""), when her original target is aborted. Atkinson delivers the best performance as the sincere Klansman's wife. Indeed, she looks and behaves like simple-minded, white-trash, but she emerges as the most believable character. Spike Lee and freshman scenarists Charlie Wachtel and David Rabinowitz, with Kevin Willmott of ""Chi-Raq"" have a field day making the KKK look like clowns. The audacity of Ron Stallworth and the success of his operation highlight this movie. Ironically, after Stallworth wraps up his investigation with the arrest of Connie, Captain Bridges (John Lee Burke of ""Tombstone"") pulls the plug on it owing to a shortage of funds. He orders everybody to destroy all records of the investigation. ""BlackkKlansman"" is well-worth watching not only as a chapter in race relations in contemporary America, but also a depiction of the buffoonish KKK. Lee caps all these lightweight shenanigans with documentary footage of the tragic The Charlottesville, Virginia, ""Unite the Right"" rally (Aug. 2017) where the white supremacists killed a liberal activist Heather Heyer and injuring almost 40 other people. This tacked on ending is probably the most devastating thing about ""BlackkKlansman."" The film was adapted from Ron Stallworth's book. Incidentally, not everything is either true or accurate. For example, Lee and his scenarists set the film in 1972 instead of when it really occurred in 1979. The comedy is fine until the disturbing epilogue that shows how dangerous the idiotic Klan and other white supremacists are."

","I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, the pacing was a little uneven, but the acting was good and the messaging varied nicely between a light touch and a sledgehammer. It had just enough nuance in its main character and part of the storyline to feel real.<br/><br/>That's why I was so disappointed when I learned that one of my favorite parts of the movie - the Jewish detective who hadn't ever thought much about it until he had to deny it - was completely fictional. Props to the writers for scripting something that feels so true to life, but I felt a little lied to when I learned that it wasn't part of the true story.<br/><br/>I liked that the film showed both racist police behavior and police redemption. That issue isn't black and white, and I was nervous about how it would be treated. I thought the balance was healthy.<br/><br/>A lot of people are blasting this film for the montage at the end. I thought it was powerful. I tremble every time I see that footage from Charlottesville, and this was no exception. What's happening in our country that emboldens Neo-Nazis is wrong, and I applaud any film that tackles the moral lesson head-on and refuses to equivocate or make excuses for it."
"markgorman","8","4","9","24 January 2019"," Excellent period piece that tackles a tricky subject head on.
","Kaboooooooom!<br/><br/>That's the sound of Spike Lee returning with a bang.<br/><br/>Lee's work has been lean pickings for me since his heyday in the late 80's and early 90's with movies like Do the Right Thing and She's Gotta Have It.<br/><br/>But the rest of his cannon (maybe through ignorance on my part) has failed to engage me.<br/><br/>But this almost nails it.<br/><br/>My one overall criticism is that, at times, I'm not sure if Lee wants to make a comedy or a searingly monstrous docu-drama.<br/><br/>For me the hate he brings to the screen out punches the comedy 10:1.<br/><br/>Two characters in the movie should have been booted into touch: both are lampoons and detract from what is otherwise a great whole. These are the hate-filled racist local cop (Officer Clay Mulaney) and the KKK sidekick Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser - hilarious in a similar slapstick role in I Tonya, but misplaced here).<br/><br/>They are minor distractions but become grit in your eye, detracting from the overall menace and subtle humour surrounding a subject that is far from humorous.<br/><br/>What Lee does with this is face up, full on, to the endemic prejudice that fuels the police force and the local white population in small town Colorado.<br/><br/>He creates a sense of time and place that is authentic and cool man. As you would expect from a Spike Lee Joint the black cast are dealt most of the best hands, but Adam Driver (as a Jewish cop - only one step removed from being black in this chapter of the KKK's eyes) performs an excellent supporting role as the white man who infiltrates the KKK on behalf of his black colleague (John David Washington).<br/><br/>You'll know the plot constuct by now so I won't bore you with that.<br/><br/>What makes it a great movie is the sense of time, place and politics, the soundtrack and the unflinching ability of Lee to capture the racist poison that is encapsulated in the performance of Jasper Pääkkönen as Felix Kendrikson; by far the most committed and cynical of the Klansmen. And yet it is underpinned by nice comedic moments (other than the slapstick I described earlier).<br/><br/>There's a scene in which the Chapter watch a screening of Birth of a Nation where, although underpinned by some humour, that hatred really does come across compellingly. It's chilling.<br/><br/>It's a great (true) story that is extremely well told.<br/><br/>At times the cinematography is truly outstanding - in particular the scene in which a visiting black political speaker (Kwame Toure, played by Corey Hawkins) addresses the local black student population. Lee creates a montage of faces from the crowd that echoes Queen's seminal Bohemian Rhapsody video but so stylistically and handsomely that it's art on screen for just a few fleeting moments.<br/><br/>It's seared on my mind.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","Set in the 70s, the film introduces us to Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), an African-American rookie policeman from Colorado. Ron's job in the police station is to return and retrieve criminal files when requested by fellow police officers. Ron feels he is called for greater things and feels ready for something big, something like ... going under cover. When he expresses this to his captain, he is then transferred to work in the ""Resources"" department.<br/><br/>While in Resources, Ron reads local newspapers, looking for clues or any leads he feels should be investigated. Ron soon finds a local ad for the ""Ku Klux Klan"" and he calls them, pretending to be a racist white guy over the phone. He does this so well that he manages to get an invite to further discuss the group in person. There's just one problem... Ron can't actually meet these people in person. Ron is encouraged to work with fellow officer, Flip (played by Adam Driver), who will pretend to be Ron in person and Ron himself will continue the communications over the phone. The two officers will work together to question and investigate the group's intentions and seek out if there are any plans or threats to the people within the city.<br/><br/>This film can be classed as a true story, but it also has a touch of comedy. The film's dialogue contains many well written lines. For many cinemas viewers, there are funny moments to be seen and enjoyed through the dialogue. For me personally, I found humour within this film came from the actual journey which our two leads took. How these two officers discover and find key information in this investigation was rather surprising, even more so when I had to remind myself again and again that this film is based on a true story and this actually happened!<br/><br/>This film is well written, well directed and most importantly it's incredible well acted. I'm not surprised to see Adam Driver succeeding in his role here once again, but most importantly, the son of Denzel Washington, John David Washington who played Ron Stallworth, takes the lead in this film and the end results are awesome. I found his performance to be a rather memorable one. The world of the 70s is alive and the costume design and the film's soundtrack is truly nailed here.<br/><br/>By the end of the film I felt that it was rather evident that the film had a number of key messages to deliver from the passionate director, Spike Lee. I felt these were unexpected but most certainly welcomed for 2018. If you were expecting a Starsky and Hutch style of action film, you could be somewhat shocked. The key element of the film is simply the incredible story that took place in 70s. The focus is not on delivering an action packed comedy film by any means.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a truly outstanding film by Spike Lee. The film has an incredible story to share along with passionate messages suitable for 2018. The film isn't a knock out action comedy film, but it can bring some chuckles either through actual events that took place with these characters or perhaps the general dialogue. In the end, this is a film that will evoke different feelings in each and everyone one of us. If the director wanted people to have discussions after seeing this film, then I would say it worked.<br/><br/>8.6/10

"Tweekums","8","3","6","25 August 2019"," Occasionally heavy handed but still well worth watching
","This film is inspired by real life events in the 1970s when Ron Stallworth, an officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department, infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. Officer Stallworth is actually African American and contacted the Klan by phone so when members of the local chapter ask to meet him he has to find a white officer, in this case a non-religious Jew named Flip Zimmerman, to attend any face to face meetings while he continues the phone contact. Flip is welcomed by most of the chapter but one is highly suspicious; Ron eventually finds himself talking to, and ultimately befriending David Duke, the Klan's leader. Ron also gets involved with Patrice Dumas, a local black power advocate who distrusts the police and is in the sights of the KKK.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this film I thought it must be a comedy; the concept sounded too crazy... then I learnt that it was inspired by true events. Like many such films plenty of liberties have been taken with the actual events but the core of the story is true; a black police officer did infiltrate the Klan. The film creates an interesting narrative; from Ron Stallworth joining the police, dealing with racism there then going undercover at a black power student meeting to joining the Klan. The story does provide many amusing moments; mostly at the expense of those that deserve to be mocked, namely the Klansmen and other racists. There is also plenty of real tension as it often looks as though Zimmerman's cover might be blown. There are times when elements of the Klan's history and historical racist incidents are discussed; most potently when a character played by Harry Belafonte tells black students about the real life lynching of a seventeen year old black boy in Texas in 1916. The central cast is solid; most obviously John David Washington and Adam Driver, who play Stallworth and Zimmerman but also those playing the Klansman; they make them believably disturbing rather than just pantomime villains. On the down side the attempts to link what happened then to events in modern America is very heavy handed; we even get an epilogue showing an admittedly terrible event; something that detracted from the main story of the film... still this wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of a film that is well worth watching."

","Glass shatters at a Brooklyn pizza joint after Mookie tosses a garbage can into his master's house. It's retribution for the blue and white murder of Radio Raheem. Mookie can't coexist in both worlds anymore. He heeds his best friend's advice. ""Stay black,"" Buggin' Out tells the pizza delivery boy, early on in ""Do the Right Thing"", Spike Lee's third and best-known film, because he wants Mookie to quit his job and support the boycotting of Sal's Pizzeria. Buggin' Out despises Sal, but that pizza joint is the hangout place where he and his gang have been frequenting since they were knee-high. It's a ritual, a foregone choice everybody makes in the Bedford-Stuy cul-de-sac without self-introspection. But then you get older, and for somebody like Buggin' Out, the apolitical turns political. Suddenly, the place where you eat your slice matters. Before he takes his first bite, Buggin' Out looks at Sal's ""Hall of Fame"", as if for the first time. ""How come there ain't no brothers on the wall?"" the disgruntled patron asks Sal, adding that it's black folks, not Italians who spend ""much money"" at his inner-city eatery. Sal, so incensed at being tested, comes out from behind the counter wielding a baseball bat that Pino subtly removes from his father's hands. An audience may misread the older son, since his animosity towards the clientele is no secret. And yet, he staves off the inevitable until closing time, when Sal makes good on his promise: ""I'm going to kill somebody today."" Sal is the unabashed bigot, latent racism brought to light by circumstantial fate. Pino is not his father. When Buggin' Out suggests that Michael Jordan's likeness be inducted to Sal's hallowed wall, Pino smiles, in covert solidarity. Admiration for the Bulls guard is a bridge that the Bensonhurst native doesn't dare cross, in spite of a desire for camaraderie, because what would his friends back home say? Larry Bird fans, the whole lot, probably. Pino has more in common with the black community he purports to despise than the brownstone-owning white bicyclist donning a Celtics jersey who runs over Buggin' Out's immaculate Air Jordans with his ten-speed.<br/><br/>Because of peer pressure, Pino is expected to denounce Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" because of Chuck D.'s pointed takedown of Elvis Presley and John Wayne. And yet, he is curiously neutral as Radio Raheem turns the volume up on the anthemic rap song, while his father undergoes an emotional meltdown about the noise pollution. Mookie knows Pino's secret. All of his coworker's heroes are black. He puts him to the test. Sal answers: ""Magic Johnson...Eddie Murphy,"" before Pino catches on to the methodology behind Mookie's inquiry and switches gears, claiming that ""Bruce"", not Prince, as his favorite rock star. The racist slurs are a cover. ""Down deep inside,"" Pino hates his olive-skinned complexion. Mookie guesses: ""I think you wish you were black,"" just like Vito, the younger brother, who probably uses black lingo to greet Mookie every morning. Vito is out, in regard to fluidity with racial dialects and identities. But even he can't quote Louis Farrakhan, accurately. It's Pino, more so than the Korean grocer, who can lay claim to being the ""same"", to being ""black"". When Pino quotes the Minister Louis Farrakhan: ""We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past,"" Mookie doesn't blink an eyelid. Pino's charade of flubbing the Nation of Islam's leader's name with several false starts doesn't fool him. After all, he notes, Pino's hair is kinkier than his. It's the father, not the son, who has no interest in African-American culture. Pino probably has a begrudging respect for the aesthetics of rap music. The shopkeeper and his wife, conversely, loathed Radio Raheem. The C/D battery incident, Sweet Dick Willie has no knowledge of, when he calms the angry mob with fire on their minds. ""The Korean is all right,"" he tells his friend ML. The Korean is not all right. During the sequence in which ethnic group representatives hurl racial epithets at each other, Sonny expresses a disdain for Jewish people. The grocer imitates Ed Koch with a sustained vitriol that has more in common with a Nazi-era German than some contemporary African-American Brooklynite. ""I no white,"" he pleads with the converging dark-skinned locals, swinging a dust mop to fend off the riff-raff. But the emigre will say anything to save his livelihood and life, by any means necessary.<br/><br/>""Europa Europa"", the 1990 historical war drama by Agnieszka Holland, could be dubbed ""Do the Prudent Thing"". Life during wartime means having to modify your moral universe. Solomon Perel, a Polish Jew, is the survivor-type. When German planes attack a Bolshevik convoy, Solly hides under a truck to avoid Luftwaffe bullets. The vehicle carrying the Communist reactionaries pulls away, stranding him among the walking dead. Inna knows her comrade's fate; he will succumb to Nazi capture. She rolls Solly a red apple. Metaphorically speaking, an apple with skin intact is like an uncircumcised p****; an apple without skin is a circumcised p****. Skin is the difference between life and death. It's something to worry about in the future. But, for now, Solly tells the sergeant his name is Josef Peters, a German, of Baltic German descent, a dark-haired Aryan with Latvian roots. Whereas the Korean grocer knows enough English to bamboozle the African-American throng with his claim of solidarity based on non-whiteness, Solly is fluent in both Russian and German, which helps corroborate his tall-tale about being reprogrammed by Soviet captors and deposited in an orphanage where he received a Communist-minded education as a member of Komsomol, a political youth organization. Out on the battlefield, Solly never picks up a gun, but instead, works as a translator. He fights on the same side as the very people who killed his family. Kellerman, his buddy, gives him a haircut, which evokes the couplet: ""I changed my hairstyle so many times now/I don't know what I look like,"" from ""Life During Wartime"", a Talking Heads song that aptly describes the cons of collaboration. Solly loses his religion. An accidental war hero, ""Josef"" is transferred to a prestigious Third Reich school, where he pledges allegiance to a bust of the fuhrer as a prerequisite for joining the Hitler Youth. He falls in love with a Nazi maiden, Leni. It's not until the Waffen-SS recruit passes a desecrated Jewish graveyard, where all the headstones are dug up to the delight of his girlfriend, does he finally wake up from an Aryan-induced trance. It's not Josef, but Solomon, his former-self, who slaps Leni. The girl from Germany, the boy from Poland learns, would slit his throat if she discovered what he was. Josef's attempt to sew the helmet back on ends in discoloration. The apple has no skin.<br/><br/>The Klan advertises in a Colorado Springs daily, so Ron Stallworth cold-calls the KKK, and just like that, presto, he gets Walter on the line. To fool the regional Klan leader, Ron uses the king's English in a Caucasian-accented voice as he launches into a diatribe about his hatred for ""******s"" and ""***s"". Ron's gift for impersonation is so convincing, his colleagues stop what they're doing and openly gawk at their new colleague. Where does it come from, this gift for mimicry; this performative hate monologue? It comes, no doubt, from spending a lot of time around white folks. Ron lived a sheltered life; he grew up on a military base. The ex-army brat tells Chief Bridges and a black recruitment agent that ""my parents raised me the right way,"" coded talk for the white way. He shares with Mr. Turrentine, the characteristic of being at a far remove from the radicalism of their peers. These soul brothers; these soul sisters, grew up as targets. That's why Ron answers: ""Will that happen, sir?"" when Turrentine asks about his conduct should another cop call him a ""******"". Ron's black experience was blanched of color. For the first time in his life, he encounters the same casual racism just like any other ""Negro"". As a rookie, he fetches the files of ""toads"" in the records department, back and forth, like a trained dog. On assignment as an undercover detective, Ron doesn't know that the ex-Black Panther changed his name to Kwame Ture, the radical he has been tasked with monitoring. He wants to cut to the front. That's privilege. Patrice, the Black Student Union president, tells Ron to stand in the back of the line like everybody else. Patrice doesn't know what the audience knows, which is that this new recruit wasn't raised to fight the power. Kwame's words ""stop running away from being black"" hits Ron square in the mind's eye. It's what made him join the police force; to transcend his skin color. Ron realizes that he identifies with Tarzan, as Kwame did as a youngster, when it's the savages, who are the corrective analogues for blacks in the seventies. ""Superfly"" is Ron's favorite flick. Patrice corrects him; a pimp can't be a hero. ""The image does damage to our people,"" she warns. Ron, however, identifies with Blaxploitation films more so than black leaders. He would rather be John Shaft than W.E.B. DuBois. Ron is the frantic Korean grocer screaming: ""I black. You. Me. Same."" No. Hell, no. Ron and Patrice are not the same. ""Right on,"" the cop shouts, in unison with the students, like an awakening.<br/><br/>To fool the KKK, Ron needs a body to go with his voice. Flip is not only Ron's partner, but a projection of himself. In the locker room, they rehearse. Ron, a black man, instructs Flip on how to sound like a Protestant Anglo-Saxon. It's not as crazy as it sounds. Flip is Jewish. Like Pino, all of his heroes are black. Ron chants: ""Say it loud/I'm black/I'm proud,"" as a sort of connective tissue to Pino.<br/><br/>Eventually, bringing down the Klan becomes a crusade for Flip, too. His awakening is ingrained in the film's title. Look at the lower-case ""k"".<br/><br/>""BlacKkKlansman"".<br/><br/>Dig?<br/><br/>Pizzerias.<br/><br/>Crosses.<br/><br/>Auschwitz."
"isaacj02","9","3","6","17 April 2019"," Spike Lee strikes gold in fierce sociopolitical satire
","Spike Lee has always been a refreshingly brazen filmmaker; with movies like Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X, the director is not one to shy away from political statements all delivered with distinct style and zest. The same is true of Lee's latest film, the creatively helmed BlacKkKlansman, a fictionalised telling of the memoir of black Colorado cop, Ron Stallworth and his risky infiltration of the Ku Klux Klan. Here, Spike Lee is at his best, painting an enticing tonal mix of humour and horror that feels all too topical.
Son of Denzel, John David Washington stars as Stallworth, the so-called ""Jackie Robinson of the Colorado Springs Police Department"" and the first black officer. Ron's ethnic background makes him the man for an undercover mission spying on black activist Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins), as he excites the city's discontented African-American community. Soon enough, however, Ron is caught up at the other end of the racial spectrum as he and partner Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) attempt to infiltrate their local chapter of the KKK by posing as a budding white supremacist. It's a life-risking double act as Flip becomes the ""face"" of Ron Stallworth, as the real Ron rises the ranks through incidental phone calls with KKK Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace).
BlacKkKlansman is a film that presents racism in an interesting way, almost as a dichotomy between the ridiculous and threatening. The script is a genius work, jolting along with the speed of a bullet between moments of almost absurdist comedy to those of darker truth. A particularly good example is that of a racist couple cosying up to one another in bed, dreamily discussing their plans for homemade terrorism. This is a film where white supremacy is served with cheese and crackers and social commentary is accompanied by bizarre humour. Lee does a superb job of balancing these tones, catching the laughs in one's throat within a net of horror. This clashing approach continues throughout the film, even into Terence Blanchard's innovative score, which jumps from the safety of strings to impassioned guitar riffs.
Washington and Driver are two very-well cast leads; the former's delightfully dry yet nuanced performance allows the film to stay grounded. Driver's performance is equally captivating; in many ways, Flip has the scarier side of the job, having to meet the members of the Klan face to face hoping they believe the caricature and stay masked to his Jewish heritage. An opening cameo by Trump-impersonator himself, Alec Baldwin reminds one of the trenchant relevance of Lee's film; the costume design and jukebox soundtrack lend it all the authenticity of a 70s period piece, but the inclusion of Trumpist slurs, ironic asides and a heart wrenching final sequence remind us that BlacKkKlansman is very much a film for today. There are points where the film seems a little too self-aware, but perhaps it is intended to be; from the profane tagline right to the end credits, Lee is truly in control of his craft and the message he wants to put forward. Performances by Washington and Driver are brilliant and credit is due to Get Out's Jordan Peele for the pitch, but the real star here is Spike Lee. With BlacKkKlansman, the director returns to form with satire as it should be; sickeningly hilarious, yet equally as shocking and, most of all, with something important to say."

Race relations were, and are shitty. Are radical changes needed to reverse hundreds of years of stupidity? Yes. Will they happen?

Blackkklansmen somehow oozes 'cool' while at the same time grappling with America's tense racial politics. It's a nice time capsule to the hip 1970's but still makes jokes about current events. 
The jokes land, the action is tense, and I found myself locked in for about 90% of the film. That's my only complaint is the film felt about 15 minutes too long. All in all, this movie is definitely worth seeing."
"jordan2240","7","3","6","21 August 2018"," Entertaining with a powerful ending
","I've read a number of the reviews here before writing my own, and I believe both the positive ones and negative ones have merit. First, I find the assertion that this is about a black man who infiltrated the Klan a bit misleading. Mr. Washington didn't personally infiltrated the Klan as much as his 'surrogate' did. Without Driver's character, the 'infiltration' does not exist.<br/><br/>My main concern with any film based on a true story is, how much of it is true, how much is stretching the truth, and how much is just made up. Reading some of the reviews, it seems that much of this story is made up, though I have no doubt it captures to a fairly accurate degree some of the attitudes that were prevalent during the time period when the event took place, and incorporates events that occurred but weren't related to this particular story.<br/><br/>Regardless, I did enjoy the film, and even found Driver's performance acceptable (I usually find him rather boring in his acting style). Much of what I presume is false with regard to the actual story created a decent suspense picture, with a few moments of comic relief thrown in that worked.<br/><br/> I suspect that those who are not fans of Trump as president, like myself, will like it more than those who are, as no attempt is made to hide the political viewpoint of director Lee. The ending, featuring recent live footage, paints a powerful picture of just how little progress we've made on race relations, and was easily the most emotional segment of the film for me."
"peedipete44","7","3","6","21 August 2018"," Great acting, John Washington making a name for himself

Great acting in the movie, John Washington plays his role perfectly and a great supporting cast behind him. I'm not a big Spike Lee fan but he did a great job here. Had very funny parts but not to much to where you don't take the serious parts seriously. Dragged a little bit in the 2nd half but a strong funny and serious ending.

It is far from comfortable and not at all accurate or believable. The real story should have been told, but the acting is garbage and the directing is worse. Don't waste your time.

Some films say ""based on a true story"", but it later you find out it was extremely loosely based on the original story. This film does add some fictional elements to the original story, but I was amazed at how much of it actually happened. Half the movie I was sitting there thinking ""There's no way that actually happened"", but then it turned out that some of what happened was even more crazy than what was portrayed in the film!

","As expected from a Spike Lee joint, BlacKkKlansman explores race relations in an shamelessly dark and off-beat manner. It succeeds in triggering a genuine reaction out of you; Disturbing, but often very funny, thanks to the resolute performances of Washington and Driver. There are some pacing issues due to some overlong, pretentious sequences, and I wasn't a fan of the ending, which leaps ahead in time to showcase fairly recent events of social unrest that have minimal connection to the story that was dramatized. I'm not saying these horrid events should go on ignored, but it was just an abrupt and preachy way to close what was a very well-crafted film. I don't think BlacKkKlansman is the masterpiece most critics claim it is. It's certainly a timely and important movie, but there were a few choices Lee made that soured part of the experience for me."

","I saw ""BlacKkKlansman"", starring John David Washington-Ballers_tv, Malcolm X, Oh yeah, he is the son of Denzel; Adam Driver-Kylo Ren in the Star Wars movies, This Is Where I Leave You; Laura Harrier-Spider_Man:Homecoming, One Life To Live_tv and Topher Grace-Predators, Spider_Man 3.
This movie is based on a true story about an African-American cop that infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970's. It is based on the book that was written by the police officer doing the infiltrating, Ron Stallworth and directed by Spike Lee. John plays Ron, the first black cop in Colorado Springs, Colorado. At first, he is given office file duty and gets really bored really quick. Then, he gets the idea to try and infiltrate the KKK after he calls them-and using his best white voice-talks to the head honcho himself, David Duke, played by Topher. He keeps up the masquerade over the phone but he needs a white cop to meet the klan members in person, so that's where Adam comes in. Laura is working for a college group of young protesters that John infiltrates-he also falls for her. The movie covers racism, anger & hate during the period so there is some strong, racially charged language. You can see parallels between the way people acted then and the way people do today-there are some subtle Trump jabs. There are also a couple of cameos. Harry Belafonte tells a story of racism and torture during one part of the movie. As the end credits start, you can hear 'Mary Don't You Weep' by Prince, a previously unreleased live recording and they also show some actual riot footage taken at Charlottesville about a year ago, plus a tribute to the murder of Heather Heyer.
It's rated ""R"" for language-including racial epithets-disturbing and violent material and sexual references and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.
It is a thought provoking film and I would probably buy it on DVD."

","Robbie K back again with another review, this time on a biography that showed promise for being a wild, crime filled law. Yet, there was the potential political game embedded in it that looked to get in the way, bringing concern that this movie may go down the wrong pathway. Nevertheless, I'm back to give you yet another review in hopes that I can help shed some light onto whether the movie is worth its weight in money. Let's get started on the review of: <br/><br/>Blackkklansman (2018)<br/><br/>Director:
 Spike Lee
Writers:
 Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz 
Stars:
 John David Washington, Adam Driver, Laura Harrier <br/><br/>
LIKES: <br/><br/>Great Setting 
Costumes And Makeup
Clever Comedy
Awesome Sound Editing
Fantastic Acting
Strong Lessons <br/><br/> Blackkklansman is one of those movies that brings you back in time to all the crazy events of history. The setting alone feels like a blast from the past, as we drop into the war against segregation from the unique perspective of an undercover agent. Amidst the world building of this movie, comes an impressive display of retro fashions of the time, bringing nostalgia and a certain panache to the film. In addition, the fantastic soundtrack and sound editing brings that needed dynamic that represents emotion. While the film is certainly strong in the drama/crime aspect, the comedy is reserved for those with a dryer sense of humor. Clever wit awaits the audiences for this movie, forgoing the over the top slapstick for a richer laugh generator. Of course, all of this fails without great acting, and this film's two leads reach the goal of bringing the times to life and representing the story it wanted to tell. This strong work helps sell the strong lessons of what history can teach, wrapping it up in very grandiose, preachy method that rolls with the movie. <br/><br/>DISLIKES: <br/><br/>Aggressive dialogue
Too Dry at Times
Slow Pace
The Ending?<br/><br/>
 Back in the day, the politeness and filtering were highly more advanced than today's standards. Sadly, the accurate yelling and vocabulary is a little too much for me, hearing all the derogative slanders, hating, and passionate politics just got to eye rolling proportions. Fan who don't like all the forbidden words of sailor talk, need to already turn away from this movie, though it still has nothing on Django Unchained and Phone Booth. Trying to offset this is the comedy that totally goes down the dryer route, but sometimes it becomes more a desert wasteland devoid of the usual comedic ocean. This leads to some fewer entertaining choices, and with it a slower, dragged out piece. Blackkklansman is horrible for pacing with me, establishing fantastic details, but sort of shirking the time management thing in advance of a complete story Still, the movie needed some spice to well spice things up so that the monotony could be broken up at times. Finally, the ending. Symbology and tributes are there to help motivate and teach the life lesson contained in this viewing. However, the real error I have is that the ending itself seems out of place for me. I get it, the movie was showing some current events, but it just didn't fit with the story they were trying to tell, which was about the past. <br/><br/>The VERDICT: <br/><br/> Blackkklansman is an artistic piece of work, that makes some parts of history fun to revisit. However, the movie still needs some help with maximizing the entertainment/suspense element in their work. Given the dry, barren joke pool and an ending that doesn't quite click, you can see why the film gets some points docked away from it. Still, looking for the informative, big-budget portrayal of the events that took place, the movie does warrant some applause for the ability to make history come to life once more. Worth a trip to the theater? Can't say so, unless you want a political work of art... literally. <br/><br/>My scores:<br/><br/>Biography/Comedy/Crime: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0"

","To learn about racism, I think this is a good film. American History X has way more drama than this, but can't closely related. This one, yes. This film shows us that, after many years, there are not many improvement from racism and in the American government. The slogan ""American 1st, doesn't sound that racist but now it does after watching the film. I would put this one as an educational film and not for entertainment. If you like America, i suggest not to watch it. It only makes America looks bad. It does help me learn that having the notions of White Power, Black Power or Asian Power are just stupidity and dangerous."

","I don't know how true this story was. I did enjoy watching it, but coming from a non racist area of California I found the KKK members to be outrageous and they seemed like caricatures. Are they really that bad and ignorant? I found the soft touch depiction of the Black Panthers and their talking about arming themselves for the coming civil war and the blatant, over the top murderous, ignorant depiction of the KKK slightly revealing. I value truth and don't want to be manipulated at the theater. The movie was good and funny at times. But the whole idea that Trump was calling the neo-Nazis ""good people"" at the end of the film is just more lies and this is what keeps this stupid race war going. Trump was not approving of the thugs of the neo-nazis or of the thugs of anti-fa. He was referring to people who don't want every single statue in the south torn down because young people today paint every single soldier in the Civil War as evil. This was half of America, people, was everyone a demon? No. And some people at that march in Charlottesville simply wanted to stop statues from being knocked down. Then, the thugs of Anti-fa and the thugs of KKK and neo-Nazis showed up and now Trump's words are used by the left to brand him a ""racist"", their favorite word. Sad that that twisting of the facts had to end the movie. Sad that Jordan Peele seems to share that belief. I love Peele's comedy but that part of the movie ruined it for me. Other than the blatant anti-Trump message, I liked the movie."

"august-34947","6","4","10","15 August 2018"," Inflitrate Hate
","BlacKkKlansman is a generally well made, crowd pleasing movie but, I have a lot I want to say about it so, this is going to be a spoiler heavy, very long review.
The first shot of the movie from ""Gone with the Wind"" is a very bold and clever start, both establishing the tone and calling forward to Ron's discussion with David Duke. The opening scene featuring Alec Baldwin felt kind of unneeded. Also, having the red text with black text under layed looked like something I would to in Windows Movie Maker for a 7th grade Chemistry presentation. However, despite this issue, I still really think this is an absolutely brilliant opening scene that perfectly establishes the tone of the rest of the film.
So, when we are first introduced to Ron Stallworth, the scene is very well done, classic Lee using cinematography and framing to the best of his advantage. The police station is very well shot and interestingly lit for the most part. There are a couple scenes in which I felt they weren't all that well lit, for example the scene which Ron and Flip first pin up their membership card to the Ku Klux Klan was a bit too dark.
The scene with Kwame Ture's speech is the first sign of some of the film's worst qualities, ham fisted dialogue and bad editing. Did we really need 15 insert shots of crowd reactions that faded into each other? I don't think we did. I should also mention Ron's generic love interest, Patrice. I found none of the scenes between them interesting whatsoever. You know exactly where they are going to go and, you have seen those same scenes in movies a million times before. It isn't surprising that the real Ron Stallworth says Patrice was an entirely fictitious character created to add tension in places were it didn't really exist.
If anything, I found the scenes between Flip and the Klansmen to be some of the movies best scenes. You always got a vibe of uncomfortability. That being said, whenever a joke was attempted it always had the same set up and punchline of ""Klansman says something racist, Flip contradicts it and seems not racist, Flip then corrects himself and makes it a joke that's racist"". That was kind of annoying. However, overall the writing and dynamics between various characters in these scenes was very great. For example Flip and Felix, Flip and Walter and Walter and Felix. These dynamics were all well written and added a lot to the dialogue between the characters, made it feel more natural. They were written well enough were you could imply things about the characters. The only notable example of a Klansman who I can think of that wasn't given much development was Connie and Ivanhoe, who felt kind of flat.
Now, most of the acting in the film is pretty great, notably John David Washington, Adam Driver and, Jasper Pääkkönen. However, if there was any one actor who was kind of bad it was Topher Grace, who portrayed David Duke. I wish I could say it was an intentional choice made for the sake of having David Duke sound wooden and robotic. However, Topher Grace is just a bad actor and, I can't get past that in my head. It doesn't help that whenever he, or for the record most of the actors in the film, says a racial slur and delivers it super uncomfortably, thinking Spike Lee is going to come from behind the camera and sock him in the jaw for saying the N word.
Now, to delve into some of the harder stuff to talk about in this review. The subject of race and, what Spike Lee is trying to say. I frankly think there were some things that were delivered subtly enough but, others that were so obvious it felt like he thought I wouldn't get it because I was too stupid. The good subtle things were when Kwame says (paraphrase) ""We need to learn that we don't need a white man to do things"" and Ron says later (paraphrase) ""With the right White man, I can do anything."" That was one of the really great subtle things in the film that I picked up on. However, did we really need to cut back and forth between the Black Student Union meeting and the Klan meeting to get the point? Did we really need a character to say ""No one like (David Duke) THAT would ever be elected to public office."" Ha ha. You get it? It's like Donald Trump! It's not like I made that really obvious and that same idea could've been implied without it being blatantly shoved down the audience's throat. Honestly, that part of Spike Lee's writing really annoys me. It feels so cheap and forced every time. It felt forced at points in Do the Right Thing and, it feels no different here.
Now back to the film itself. The climax of the movie was absolutely fantastic and, so well executed it baffles the mind how Spike Lee and, the rest of his team can write climaxes to his stories so fantastically. Upon first viewing, the ending to the film with wrapping up every loose end felt kind of cheesy and really dragged on. Upon a second viewing, it felt much more quickly paced but, still a bit cheesy. The blacksplotation parody part was really cool and, a great callback to the discussion Ron and Patrice had earlier in the film. Now onto the ending ending. The Charlottesville footage is such a shocking and strong ending it is sure to stick with audience members. However, Spike Lee makes the genius decision to play music over this scene. Wow great, now I'm kind of taken out of the moment. He also has to use cheesy red text to dampen the strong emotion the ending would make you feel. Not to mention throughout the entire film, music has kind of been inappropriately placed. There were just scenes that would've benefitted from being silent and let you interpret for yourself how to feel.
Overall, I enjoyed BlacKkKlansman. I mean I saw it in theaters twice. I'd see it in theaters a third time because it's such a fun and enjoyable movie with some issues. This is the first movie I've seen this year that was nominated for the Palme d'Or and, if this is setting the bar, than we can expect some rather exceptional films to set the bar even higher."

"bharaths-435-14892","5","5","14","19 August 2018"," A very forgettable affair
","Someday, there will be a great movie made about this unbelievably true story. Unfortunately, this isn't that movie. Curiosity about this little known but interesting tale, and the relevance of the story to the times we live in, will bring the crowds in to watch the film. But other than these, the movie doesn't have much going for it. The screenplay, acting and direction were very average, and it is very likely that if this movie were made in more 'normal' times, the whole affair would be very forgettable. <br/><br/>Some positives were: I thought John David Washington (Ron Stallworth) and Adam Driver (Phil Zimmerman, aka white Ron Stallworth) acted well, and displayed good acting chemistry between them. The nightclub sequence with the dance played out well, and conveyed the racially charged yet simpler times of the 70s quite well. Topher Grace (David Duke) played the role well - his sophistication and polished language a sharp contrast to the rest of the simple and menial fools that make up the KKK in this film. <br/><br/>Other than these, the rest of the characters were pretty forgettable. The KKK and its member-characters do not deserve to be portrayed as more than one-dimensional shallow hicks in even the most thoughtful movie, and so that was fine. But somehow, they did not really convey the sense of dread and disgust they were supposed to, and came across more like villains more appropriate for a Dumb and Dumber than a film centered on a detestable sentiment like white supremacy. Secondly, the rest of the cast just seem like caricatures through the film, due to lazy writing that never really explores any possibilities with them. For instance, the wife of one of the clan members, Patrice (black student union president, and John's love interest through the film) and racist cops at the station - there were opportunities to make these characters more life-like and believable, but the movie squanders these roles. It also did not help that aside from Patrice, most of the smaller characters did not act well (especially the clan guys and said wife of one of the members). <br/><br/>The build-up and climax were disappointing, and while the movie invested a lot in building up towards the final scenes, the way it all winds down is pretty anti-climactic and incomplete. Again, lazy writing? Or was poetic justice not the point of the film (but then, what was?) 
Lastly, it was disappointing to hear references to current times (e.g. David Duke saying 'it is time to really Make America Great Again' on the phone, references to how America while never elect a racist to the White House, etc.) as these seem like little more than cheap tricks in the overall scheme of things. And it was a bit of a cop out to end the film with footage from Charlottesville: Were we expected to indulge in a goofy story that never really did justice to the gravity of the topic at hand, and then suddenly flip to more serious emotions at the end when confronted with the truth? The movie, if done well, could have stood on its own, without requiring these gimmicks."

","Movies have always had the ability to change and open peoples minds. Something about actually seeing it digs deeper into a person. This film opened me up to a issue that I wasn't aware was still relevant. I thought racism was gone in the US. I'm not so naive now.<br/><br/>Director Spike Lee is known for his free, easy going spirit. Most actors have often said that he embraces the unknown, and likes to challenge movie goers, BlacKkKlansmen is no exception. No word, scene, or shot is out of place or unnecessary to the story. Often in films you will get maybe one or two really intense brilliant scenes that everyone talks about; however, every scene in this movie felt urgent and essential to the plot. I honestly can't pick it one or two scenes for you, because they were all that good. This is the kind of film that (sadly) will always be relevant no matter what time period it was made or set in.<br/><br/>Casting was absolutely perfect. Every character was embodied truly and vividly, which is often difficult when making a movie based on a true story. Actors John David Washington (Ron Stallworth), Adam Driver (Flip Zimmerman), and actress Damaris Lewis (Odetta) especially caught my attention. John embodies Ron's complex energy perfectly. Allowing the audience to really get inside of his head and see the movie through his eyes. Adam tackles the hard hitting themes of identity, and belief flawlessly. It couldn't have been easy to go to the places and feel what Flip goes through, but at the end of the day there was no man better for the Job. Actress Damaris Lewis absolutely blew me out of the water. She embodies a strong, brave, independent women who is going out and doing her part to change society. Her character is the type of strong figure every girl needs in their life, someone who shows that you need to go out in the world and help change the injustice in it yourself. Every performance was impeccable, these three in particular.<br/><br/>This movie hits on some hard topics, but it's defiantly a must see film no matter who you are. We need more pictures like this one, masterpieces that help highlight important issues and push the boundary's of film."

This movie was compelling, shocking and truthful in a raw and heart-wrenching way. The final scenes, in which real footage is shown, are absolutely hear-wrenching, and they brought a tear to my eye.

","Based on true events: Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) was a real-life police officer in Colorado Springs in the 1970s. He was notable for being the first black officer on the force. He begins a project to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan on the telephone using his 'white voice' (this seems to be a trend in movies this year - see ""Sorry to Bother You""). Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) is his colleague who shows up in person to meet the KKK as the same fictional character.<br/><br/>This film took various liberties to dramatize events. Among the biggest were the superb climax (forgivable for its brilliant execution and build-up) and the fact that the in-person decoy was of Jewish heritage. The latter is a little less forgivable as it seemed too far-fetched as well as dangerously stupid to select a Jewish man to risk his life when a more ""Aryan"" colleague would have been appropriate (as it was in real life). Despite this questionable fictionalization, it actually succeeds in making the film an intense pins-and-needles thriller throughout. The tension is so strong that the occasional lapses into humour are hilarious and very welcome relief.<br/><br/>""BlacKkKlamsan"" courageously goes to the worst side of humanity's underbelly. There is little violence in action but a lot of it in spoken words. It succeeds in making the audience truly uncomfortable as it gives Klan members a lot of time on screen - more than most films would. Rather than just exposing them as slimy rednecks (they were), they are shown as people who spoke of things important to them much like ""normal"" people would when speaking of events such as a wedding, a fishing expedition, or a charitable event. Their words are terrible but the way they speak them is cringeworthy in how they sound live average folks.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the build-up to the climax is superb. It includes back-and-forth viewings between two large gatherings: one, a black liberation meeting; and the other a KKK gathering as members watch ""Birth of a Nation"" and react loudly to it like they are watching a football game.<br/><br/>This fine film is directed by Spike Lee. It's great to see him at the same level again as he showed with ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) and ""Malcolm X"" (1992). He's truly a thoughtful person with a lot of talent.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, I saw this film just hours after learning of the mass murders at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. As the sad saying goes: the more things change, the more they stay the same."

I usually like to watch Best Picture Oscars before the ceremony. I'm lagging behind this year for sure. I still have to see A Star is Born, Roma and The Favourite. But I did see Spike Lee's film BlackkKlansman. After seeing it, I'm posed with the question how the hell did Green Book win? This is a much better, more thought provoking movie. Now I know when you say a Spike Lee film or as he calls it a joint you get a mental picture in your mind immediately. This follows that somewhat. This is more in line with Inside Man or 25th Hour while still retaining the flavor of movies like Do The Right Thing and Clockers.<br/><br/>It sticks you in those uncomfortable places while still maintaining the silliness of the beliefs. There is an early scene where Ron is forced to go undercover at a Stokely Carmichael speech. It sits with the speech. It stays with the faces of the people in the audience. You soak it in. It's important to soak in the positives aspects of black culture before you're thrust into the den of the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>Everything seems normal from the outside. One member's wife bakes them food for their meeting. There is no real talk of violence at first. Everything just seems tranquil at first. But the hatred is there even when clothed by banality. The hatred is everywhere. Spike Lee does help you let your guard down with the comedy. The history is always there. The hatred is always there. It's the main thing that that gut punch of an ending leaves you with.<br/><br/>I know it's not the uplifting message that Green Book presents. It might be why it lost out at the Oscars. It has a political edge to it but really the message exists in the comedy and the performances. It's in the eyes. Everyone's secret is in those eyes for sure.<br/><br/>I think that Spike Lee was able to impart the message and lessons that he wanted us to learn. It's there in the margins of the entertainment we watch. It's there in the comedy we make of history's villains. They need to be clowns but they also don't need to be forgotten or underestimated. I give this movie a B."

And honestly, even after the half of the film I was still trying hard to enjoy the film and to convince myself that the turn of the events must be later amazing if I wait enough. Unfortunately the promised climax was nothing but a ""nah"" and the typical Holywood clichés started pouring down that I don't know how many times I had to roll my eyes. There were other problems as well, like the editing which didn't make a lot of sense in some scenes and also the soundtrack. The main theme coming up in most of the scenes killed the whole vibe as it sounded like a cheap erotic b-film and even the jokes didn't work and come to rescue. By the way, I really respect Adam Driver and love how he progressed in his career, but seriously, how could he get an Oscar nomination for this role?
To sum it up, a promising film ended up being a possible, actually would be better, a youtube video and this was one of the most non-deserving Oscar nominated films ever."

","A new Spike Lee film is usually good news for white liberal-leaning viewers such as myself; and one that goes after the Trump-infused rise of white nationalism is doubly so. Knowing myself target audience does tend to temper the viewing experience though, because I know I am more prone to like it for the familiarity of camera movements, scoring, and political slant - and all of this can distract from the film itself. Many critics seem to have done the same, because this is not as strong a film as many would have you believe.<br/><br/>Set within a true story, the guts of it is engaging in its focus on character and place. There is a certain irony that the true elements of the story also tend to produce what feels like plot holes, and these do tend to distract. The quality of the delivery helps carry it too, because generally the writing is not sharp; it is worthy, it is important, yes, but it is not crisp or clever. The thread through from the past to the modern day doesn't totally work because it plays the KKK characters as pretty low or obvious types, sometimes even enjoying a laugh at their expense. The link from that to the real death of a person last year feels hollow - the end is powerful, but it feels dropped in, not part of the whole.<br/><br/>In moments and in sequences, the film engages and offers much to enjoy in the quality of its director and cast, however as a total product it doesn't come together. The uneven tone, the messy approach, and the inconsistent delivery aren't compensated for by the message or its importance. There is stuff to like about the film, but it is not as good as many would have you believe."

","""Blackkklamsman"" Review
(9/10)<br/><br/>Spike Lee is coming at you with his greatest and most galvanizing movie in years. BlacKkKlansman is right up there with Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X in the Spike's Joint pantheon of game-changers.
BlacKkKlansman, adapted by Lee, David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Willmott from Stallworth's book, demands the best from everyone, including cinematographer Chayse Irvin, editor Barry Alexander Brown and composer Terence Blanchard. (Having Get Out provocateur Jordan Peele on the producing team doesn't hurt, either.) Still, the movie breathes Lee as he walks a tightrope over the heroic best and craven worst of humanity.
Some might argue that the movie didn't need a present-day coda of the showdown between white nationalists and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia; the notorious Trump speech claiming there was ""blame on both sides""; or the still-active hatemonger Duke praising the President's comments. I am not one of those people.
While this movie may have been about a true story from back in the 70s, this true story still has tons of merit in today's society. For the most part, the moments of levity serve to keep the bleakness at bay. Evil is among us, hidden - or not so hidden - in the hearts of ordinary-looking people. As the film's final moments make clear, we need a new fight back against it."

These are themes which undoubtedly have the potential to be divisive; however, BlacKkKlansman's comic approach to the issues make it an enjoyable experience, rather than a harrowing one. Excellent performances, a killer soundtrack."

","A truly exceptional film, intense and very provocative. It gave me chills and it was not at all funny. It was very sad because it's truthful.
This is a social, political, cultural movie, it deserves to be called one of the best of the year.
I usually get attached to the stories i watch and this movie got me so nervous that i couldn't finish it on the first day of watching, the film is a constant roller coaster of emotion this is why i watched each hour of it on a two separate days.
Spike Lee continue talking against so many people who wants him silent, with great directing. John David Washington and Adam Driver (who portray Ron and his partner) both deliver exceptional performances.
It has one of the most powerful and memorable endings, I'm not american and I didn't know that these stuff are still going on in the same world i live in , the final footage from the end was shocking to me."

","BlacKkKlansman is a film co-written and directed by Spike Lee. The acclaim surrounding this film along with it being in the Oscars compelled me to watch the film. After watching it, I can say that this film is pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Plot: Follows Ron Stallworth, a police detective in the Colorado Spring PD and his attempt to infiltrate the local Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>Story and direction: To be very honest, I haven't watched most of Spike Lee's ventures except for INSIDE MAN which to me was quite a different kind of thriller. So watching this film for me I had no expectations whatsoever. But having said that I was mesmerized by the sheer brilliance this film had. Each and every frame had a uniqueness and beauty in it. I am not saying that the film is perfect, but it was great to watch. The writing of the film is so intelligent that in scenes of tension they introduce certain things that make it a delight to watch. The subtle comedy is to watch out for and I can understand many people not getting that. The use of music and the songs played in the background are just awesome. You feel like you are in the 70's and living in the era. The film is basically about racism and a big salute from my side to the makers for portraying this aptly (although I still have heard from various sources that certain things were not correctly depicted). With that being said, I still felt the film would have been better if the runtime was trimmed a bit. Also, the romantic subplot made no sense and I didn't feel any need for it.<br/><br/>Performances: Let me say that I just love Denzel Washington. He has a charm and that hasn't faded up until now. Now watching his son in the film, I even fell in love with him. He lives up to his father's name and I want to see more of him. Adam Driver doesn't have much of a role but he shines with what was given to him. Laura Harrier was OK. Ryan Eggold and Jasper Paakkonen were great. And so were Topher Grace and Ashlie Atkinson. Robert John Burke and Fred Weller also do deserve some praise.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The scene comes quite early in the film where Ron is a rookie and he is kept in the archives section and Andy comes in to ask for a file on a 'toad'. He replies that there are no toads here but human beings. He gives him the file anyway and after Andy exits, Ron does some kind of hand movements. What got me in this scene was the comedy, I was laughing throughout the scene.<br/><br/>Verdict: Many people will actually not get this film and honestly if this film would have come out a few years ago, my review would have been entirely different to the one I have written now. I had a blast watching this film and Spike Lee is definitely a director that is on my watchlist.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8.5/10."

"s3276169","7","3","7","30 October 2018"," Cherry picks the facts to fit a political agenda.....
","I'll start by saying the actual film itself is very watchable and enjoyable. The acting is excellent, the story line clever and original. Its also deeply sad and at times, extremely funny, in equal measure. Its nice to see people deriving a kind of wry humour from what is a legacy of, at times, downright nasty, discrimination.<br/><br/>Now comes the ""but"". Its unfortunate that this film doesn't let the story it tells speak for itself. Instead, it elects to stifle its powerful message by overlaying a pretty obvious political one. One that seems intent, in my opinion, on blaming one side of the political spectrum for the woes of establishment discrimination.<br/><br/>Here's a few facts that don't fit that picture. David Duke first ran for the Democrats before switching to the Republicans (its all up on Wikipedia if you wish to fact check). It was the Republicans who voted to end slavery and both the Confederacy and the Union supported segregation and the North tacitly supported slavery. To say racial discrimination is somehow a Southern mindset, is misleading.<br/><br/>The truth is the US has a long history of establishment support for all manner of discrimination. Social, racial, economic and philosophical (just look at 50's style McCarthyism which seems to be making a come back). To try to imply things are suddenly ""different"" ignores the fact that ""nothing ever really changed"" no matter which party or President was or is in office.<br/><br/>Its such a shame too, because this film was almost, almost there, with a powerful message of hope for tolerance and understanding. What a genuine shame. 7/10 from me."
"jeffspalmerpga","3","5","15","31 May 2019"," another left wing attempt to hide the truth
","Spike Lee tries very hard to portray the Klan as a conservative/right wing group, including putting Nixon posters in the meeting hall. David Duke despised Nixon and the Klan, has always been proud of being 100% Democrat. Hitler was a progressive socialist, as are the Democrats. At the end when video of the clashes with BLM and the alt right movement, what is completely ignored by the left is that the alt right movement was fully organized and funded by a very pro Obama progressive socialist that despises Trump and capitalism.

I can't say I've ever loved any of Spike Lee's films, but I haven't gone out of my way to see all of them either. To me, he seems like an angry director, bent on making sure everyone knows how angry he is, and after a while, that gets tiresome. This movie is probably the best Spike Lee that I have seen. I guess I'm just not a fan of Spike Lee, and that's fine. He's a filmmaker with a voice, and many people are drawn to that voice like it's a siren song.

Certainly, Spike Lee has held his grudge against ""white"" America for his entire career and has used the film medium as a way to express his opinion through transparent characters and generic stereotypes (SEE: Sal's Pizzeria in ""Do the Right Thing"") . But his incendiary angle is now stale - as is his cinematography. Its an incredibly interesting true story - but the director just charges off in his own direction to serve his own purposes."

The subtle stuff was great, but when the lines ""America first!"" are uttered by two Klan members in a context that made absolutely no sense (there was no discussion of any other countries, foreign policy, etc) I was severely disappointed...

","BlacKkKlansman is a Spike Lee joint that is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth (John David Washington.) He was the first black recruit of the Colorado Springs police force in the 1970s.

One day after seeing a newspaper advert, he rings the local branch of the KKK and applies to join.<br/><br/>Obviously as Ron is black he cannot meet the local members. So fellow undercover officer Detective Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) goes to the meetings but Zimmerman is Jewish. Both end up investigating radical members of the Klan who plan to wage war against the local black college student union who bought in an ex Black Panther member to speak at an event.<br/><br/>There is a powerful cameo from Harry Belafonte telling a story of a mentally handicapped black man who was found guilty of rape on trumped up charges and was then brutally lynched. The white crowd had been whipped up by D W Griffith's movie, Birth of a Nation.<br/><br/>Lee's film takes liberties with the actual true events. It starts off as a satirical drama. Lee however in unable to resist being heavy handed with his message and makes a few digs at President Trump and his America First policies, which Lee regards as code for supporting racism.<br/><br/>The film benefits greatly from the performances by John David Washington and Adam Driver.

","First of all, i did learn a couple of things that i had to look up after the movie that i found genuinely interesting and fascinating, having said that the movie touches on a very good subject but ultimately is just not very good as a movie because of pacing issues.
It's very hard for me to put the finger on it and verbalize what bothered me about the movie. I felt very disconnected with the characters mostly but was very interested in the story itself and the underlying issues.
Being called a racist if you don't like this movie shows exactly nowadays herd mentality, i was under the impression that i'm going in to watch a movie, and i will judge it as that, this is not a documentary that aim's to be judged on the researched facts. Consequently i'm also willing to forgive certain historical inaccuracies.
As i said initially the pacing is all over the place, some odd scenes in that are absolutely unnecessary to drive the story forward - but most important the ""schtick"" of this movie that the trailer showed was not necessary (and not adding anything) in my opinion in the end. Some scenes also felt incredibly rushed and felt like there was 20 minutes of additional content just missing for them to make sense, especially towards the end.
Having said all this i wasn't particularly bored, just mostly irritated and not very immersed. I don't regret going to see it, but i would not recommend the movie without reservations, i felt this is a bit of a missed opportunity and could have been even heavier on the subject."
"nathan_higgins","7","2","4","19 September 2018"," Blackkklansman (2018)
","This retelling of a most jaw-dropping police investigation ticks many boxes - namely those for artistry, roundedness and tonal consistency. It engaged me early, with the apathetic and blasÃ© persona of our central protagonist something I found incredibly attractive. His take on the KKK presence (which is advertised briefly in the trailer) never seems to tire, though the film by no means relied on this for its appeal. In fact, most of the characters (including those involved with the KKK) were well developed and believable. That said, I have a few issues with this film. Firstly, there is a romance that I did not care a lick about and seemed to be included for relief from the central plot. I found myself feeling irritated whenever it cut away to this subplot, as it felt like there was way more they could be doing to flesh out the cop - KKK cat and mouse aspect. Another big problem, perhaps the biggest one, was the political newsreel tacked onto the end. Throughout, I'd lauded their objectivity, which steered clear of commenting on the grotesqueness of the KKK and their activities. I'm not saying the KKK should be respected or anything, just that their malevolence goes without saying, really. Well, they broke cuff right before the credits rolled. The montage, which I'll try not to spoil too much, basically ended up saying something along the lines of ""the KKK is a movement at large in the USA and one that our current president endorses openly and stridently"". I am not a Trump supporter, but I don't think revealing your political views right before the curtains were drawn does a lot to help you. For me, it destroyed any trust I had accrued in the filmmakers. Was everything I just witnessed refracted through a political lens? I know this is a little pedantic, but it left me with a sour taste in my mouth."

especially aided in making the vile opinions and beliefs stated by the klansmen in particular feel all the more unhinged and threatening, especially from Pääkkönen's character who oozed uncomfortable tension all throughout the picture. But this bluntness also helped the message as well, making it feel far more grounded and farther reaching than one may initially perceive.<br/><br/>The directing style within BlacKkKlansman is quite unique at times, sometimes incorporating elements of blaxploitation films from the early 70's, in which the film is set. Certain scenes, most notably one in the 3rd act that cleverly juxtaposes the Ku Klux Klan's meeting with a nearby civil rights rally, work effortlessly to build a sense of disgust within the viewer. The ending is especially daunting and heavy, leading into actual footage of the Charlottesville rally as periled screams and hateful chants are interspersed to intensify the message. At the very least, I walked away from the film both impressed by the craft but internally shaken from the rush it gave.<br/><br/>The acting on display is phenomenally performed, as the main cast remains quite likable despite having to say such vile things while attempting to infiltrate the KKK. John David Washington as Ron Stallworth does well with balancing both a humorous side whenever needed while also displaying the correct amount of restraint during the more tonally serious moments. As for the villains of the picture, Topher Grace's depiction of David Duke is deceptively calm and restrained, feeling all the more threatening through his odd passiveness as he proclaims such obscene statements during both his phone calls with Ron and meeting speeches with his followers. Jasper Pääkkönen's role as Felix is intense and gripping, feeling even more ruthless and evil then the Grand Wizard himself. No role feels incorrectly played, as every actor brings their all to the picture, even when one I haven't mentioned plays an incomprehensible slurring drunk.<br/><br/>To end off this review, I'd like to state one of the only notable gripes I personally had with this film, which would probably have to be the way it handled modern day political allusions. While I'm certainly not adverse to these, as they can help a film connect to a modern day audience when illustrating events from a generation prior, I personally feel the way it was handled was far too tongue in cheek to not take me out of the film. It only happened three notable times throughout the film from what I caught, but each time felt as if the characters were a second away from turning to the camera and winking to the audience. I feel the Charlottesville footage at the end would have been sufficient enough to get the point across, and would have felt all the stronger and unexpected. I don't dislike these spoken allusions due to any potential political bias I have as I've seen in some other reviews on here, I just feel it wasn't handled the best.<br/><br/>In conclusion, BlacKkKlansman is a fantastically directed film that touches upon both a small domestic problem connected to a country-wide epidemic. It's powerful in both it's performances and it's messages. While it might not be entirely factually accurate, as some smaller elements were altered and changed for dramatic purposes, that doesn't excuse the expertise on display here in any way. Whether or not you agree or disagree with the message Spike Lee intends to get across to the audience, this film is undeniably quite masterful in it's execution despite very minor shortcomings."
"classicsoncall","8","3","8","1 March 2019"," """"We are black, and we are beautiful.""
","I'm not quite sure how to take this film. Spike Lee has established himself as a controversial film director and activist, and yet of his films I've seen, ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""25th Hour"", he seems to offer an even handed approach to the issue of race relations in the country. There are some exceptions here, which I'll get to, but it doesn't come across to me that he sees whites as intrinsically evil. As this picture progressed, I felt sure that newly hired black police officer Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) would eventually become radicalized via his association with Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), by the message of Kwami Ture/Stokely Carmichael (Corey Hawkins), and the overt racism of fellow cops on the Colorado Springs Police Force, like the low-life Landers (Frederick Weller). But significantly, Stallworth wended his way through various assignments to become an intelligence officer working undercover to expose members of the Klan and dirty cops within the department. Quite remarkably, he had the powerful backing of his superior officers in the department to infiltrate the Klan, and along with fellow officer Phillip 'Flip' Zimmerman (Adam Driver), both managed to negotiate some fairly dangerous situations by thinking on their feet and adjusting to changing circumstances. It came as a unique kind of shock to see the three most racist Klan members of the story get blown up as they thought they'd exact their own brand of vengeance on the Black Student Union leader.<br/><br/>However there are those veiled and overt references to making America great again, echoed by prominent Klan racist and white supremacist David Duke (Topher Grace), former President Ronald Reagan, and current President Donald Trump. That phrase comes across in the story as a trigger for those leaning in the direction of violence to achieve their aims in the quest for racial equality, so from that standpoint, it's difficult to ascertain Spike Lee's overall message. The footage of Charlottesville tends to fuel that message, but the picture's overall theme seems to support the idea of the races working together to achieve fairness, justice and dignity for all. Which makes it rather unfortunate that Lee decided to throw a tantrum at the Academy Awards when this film lost out to ""Green Book"" in the Best Picture category. Far from getting robbed, Lee went home with an Oscar of his own for Best Adapted Screenplay for this film, and that's not an altogether unsatisfactory outcome for the outspoken director."
"marciosilva-01319","9","3","8","1 March 2019"," Finally!
","It took a while, but Spike Lee won a deservedly Oscar. Great story, great performances - notably the monologue by the character played by Harry Belafonte (great cameo!) contrasting with the hate speech of the antagonist, lived by Topher Grace; in addition to achieving the feat of fitting the right amount of humor in the gaps of a dense history of prejudice in the United States. Black K Klan did not win Best Picture, but it could. And it should."

","Spike Lee is one of the most remarkable directors of the decade, independent of your political posture it is undeniable that his works have highlighted minorities and racial issues, he is the main voice of a movement, and that is a hell of a thing to do! That said, while personally I disagree with the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement in the present, I enjoyed a lot this picture, there is so much to tell about it: Let's start with the trivials, the editing was marvellous, you can easily detect a music motif, but out of that, the scenes were all so cleanly orchestrated, the story was smooth and credible; the film was comical, everyone at the cinema were loosing their asses at a couple of scenes (I would mention some examples, but I'd rather not to avoid spoilers), but much more acknowledgeable is the fact that the movie is capable of building tension and creating suspense when necessary, but also has the hability to loose and be funny at times. It's immersive, powerfull, very straight-forward with its intentions, it's beautiful to watch and although it's not too partial (politically, I mean) it makes some breathtaking parallels, it's filled with smart simbolism, and it's definitely one must-watch tape of the 2018"

","It's a very powerful film.. I just wish there was justice done for the blatant homophobia in the movie."
"PaxtonMalloy","7","3","8","7 September 2018"," Underdelivers due to some odd stylistic choices
","That this film tackles a very important topic is obvious. And on that level it delivers with all its jabs against dumb prejudices and racism. Also both or leads Adam Driver John Washington give us really good performances.<br/><br/>But from a technical standpoint this movie really underdelivers. Spike Lee chose to portrait the KKK for what it is. A bunch of clowns. And this tone is conveyed throughout the whole film. The problem is that even though it is very funny it lacks conflict. And no point do you feel like any harm will be done to our protagonist(s). Even when it comes to the supposedly climax we never really feel like there is any danger because this is just not the tone of film. This is underlined by the music Spike Lee chose. Even though at times where there should be tension we get this recurring guitar theme which never conveys tension or drama.<br/><br/>And ironically the last 3 Minutes that show footage of actual events that is the only time the movie really touches us and makes us sad about all that racism that is still out there."
"Turfseer","6","3","8","28 August 2018"," Cautionary tale of Black Police Officer's infiltration of the KKK proves of great interest but fictional plot strands fail to convince
","Spike Lee's latest is based on the memoir Black Klansman by Ron Stallworth, the first black police officer in the Colorado Springs police department. Setting the film in 1972, Lee employs dramatic license by embellishing, changing some of the facts and developing a plot that provides the narrative with a concrete through-line.<br/><br/> 
On the plus side, Lee rather bravely links the ideological roots of the Klan with anti-semitism. Not only does he emphasize the constant anti-semitic language coming out of the mouths of the Klansmen but he also highlights David Duke's dangerous belief that an international Jewish conspiracy threatens the ""purity"" of the White race and the United States as well.<br/><br/> 
Lee's stance is welcome as it's a mainstream attempt to link the history of cooperation between African-Americans and the Jewish people, both historical victims of oppression. Notably there are others in the black community who disagree and blame Jews (particularly those who are well off and are in positions of power) for oppressing them. <br/><br/> 
Lee of course still has a great deal of sympathy for more militant voices and that's why he has Stallworth speak approvingly of Kwame Ture's speech during the early part of the film (unfortunately Lee's decision to present the entire long-winded speech results in slowing the narrative down considerably-all in an attempt to prove his social cred with his more militant brothers). Still, by making the undercover officer a Jew, there is no doubt that Lee recognizes there is a bond between the two groups.<br/><br/> 
Lee also must be commended for creating a great deal of believable dialogue coming out of the mouths of his fictional group of Klansmen. Despite their repugnant beliefs, there is something oddly humorous in the dialogue and one senses that Lee had a bit of fun creating all the racist ""talk."" The same goes for the purported true to life dialogue between Stallworth and David Duke in those phone conversations in which Stallworth gets his comeuppance over the racist KKK leader.<br/><br/> 
Among the scenes that pretty much were true to life were as follows: 1) Stallworth infiltrated the Klan by making contact with them over the phone; 2) an Undercover officer was utilized to infiltrate the Klan; 3) Stallworth was assigned to infiltrate a black college student union while they were watching a speech by Kwame Ture (the former Stokely Carmichael); 4) Stallworth had multiple conversations with David Duke (the leader of the Klan) over the phone, tricking him into believing he was white; 5) Stallworth was assigned as David Duke's bodyguard on one occasion; (6) at a Klan social club, Klan members viewed D.W. Griffith's racist 1915 film, Birth of a Nartion; and (7) the investigation into the Klan was abruptly shut down by the Colorado Police Department.<br/><br/> 
The actual investigation into the Klan by the Colorado Springs police department lasted a scant nine months or so and aside from the infiltration of the group by the undercover officer and Stallworth's one time experience as David Duke's bodyguard; this is a story that does not lend itself to much action or detailed plot developments.<br/><br/> 
Thus Lee was forced to create a few events out of whole cloth to move things along. Not all of it is successful. There is a scene where Stallworth throws a rock through a Klansmen's home in order to interrupt him from giving the undercover officer a ""lie-detector test,"" to prove whether he's Jewish or not (plausible? Perhaps but I'm not sure).<br/><br/> 
The scene in which the Klansman entrusts his wife with attempting to bomb the black college student union (and later the home of the student union's leader), is awkward and doesn't feel like it could have happened at all (historically, there was some talk of the Klan bombing a gay bar but this never came to fruition). <br/><br/> 
Worse is Lee's invented scene in which a racist member of the police department gets his comeuppance after he's recorded on tape, admitting that he harassed the black college student union leader. This scene is particularly poor because in reality, entrenched racists usually remain in their posts and receive support from a whole network of colleagues. Here, as a matter of wish fulfillment, Lee takes him down!<br/><br/> 
The divergent scenes from the true history are basically as follows: 1) The Undercover officer was not Jewish; 2) the individual Klansmen depicted are fictional; 3) there was no bomb plot involving one of the Klansmen and his wife who were going to blow up a black college student union; 4) there was no racist fellow officer of Stallworth who gets his comeuppance in the end and 5) there was no apparent romance between Stallworth and the leader of the black student union.<br/><br/>
There are also the usual Spike Lee ""asides,"" which populate so many of his films. That is, he throws in gratuitous scenes which are not directly integrated into the plot. Here there's a clip from the 1939 Gone with the Wind as well as a make believe 1950s outtake tape of Alec Baldwin as a racist attempting to create a racist public service announcement (but looking bad in the process).<br/><br/> 
On the other hand, Lee's final aside is a good one: clips from the incident at Charlottesville last year in which a woman is run over by a racist in a car. The images include a now much older David Duke inciting the populace down there as well as President Trump delivering his insensitive remark citing an incorrect moral equivalence between the protesters against racism and white supremacists. The moral of course is that the Klan is alive and well in the United States even today.<br/><br/> 
Blackkklansman is a film certainly worth seeing as it tells an interesting story and serves as a cautionary tale of the incipient racism that has plagued this country since its founding. On the other hand, Lee's plotting is weak, suggesting that overall this could have been an even stronger entry in the pantheon of films that serve as a catalyst toward explaining and exposing the underbelly of fanaticism, which continues to plague this country today."

","What I thought might be a funny movie ended up being another attempt by Spike Lee to bash President Trump. His subliminal messages throughout the movie and especially at the end where he fully turns up his anti-Trump rhetoric was disgusting. We both got up and left the movie towards the end in protest."
"tehredvelvetcake","5","5","17","16 August 2018"," Slow, Forced, Good Ending
","The film tries to hard to be both a comedy and a serious rebellion-inspiring political piece. Most of the movie is just Spike Lee preaching his political views at you. <br/><br/>Besides that, the acting was mostly great (besides Felix and his wife), the cinematography was excellent, the soundtrack was interesting, but the whole thing was really slow. They never have much tension or really try raising the stakes until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Towards the climax of the movie, it finally goes from being mildly interesting to a tense, thrilling film. Then they include some footage from the riots and present day propoganda as if the movie didn't already preach to you enough about Lee's political views. <br/><br/>Would not recommend."
"dogacol","1","7","27","15 May 2019"," I thought this was satire
","I really thought Spike Lee was joking with this one. No way this could be an anti-racist film like some critics are arguing. This is precisely what a hateful racist film looks like. The way black people are portrayed is stereotypical, and that's surprising. I'm not sure if this is only obvious for people who do not live in the States. Any white critic who says this film is impressive is only because they are too afraid to sound racist. Everyone is trying to sound politically correct and use the word ""ethical"" as a cookie cutter tool to look at everything around them. A critic should not be afraid to talk about anything, let alone being afraid to be ""offensive."" It's absolutely preposterous that people think about being offensive. And because of this everyone is self-censoring themselves. I read from some critics that Green Book was a racist film made by a white person when compared to this film which was anti-racist made by an ""intellectual"" director. I did not feel that way at all. I think white critics are too afraid of their own racist thoughts, so they search for anything that resembles their own opinions. They feel like they have to love anti-racist films made by oppressed people even if the film (or any artwork for that matter) is terrible. And yes, this film is awful. Editing is a joke, the floating heads in the dark during Kwame's speech was laughable with calls and cries that sound like they were being said by a white person trying to sound black. How did anyone keep a straight face making this film? If they thought this film was serious, then they were accepting Spike Lee's discriminative and derogatory way. I hope people start making overly-offensive films so maybe some of those people who are all PC could wake up well healed after going into a coma watching them."

","You know those stories that are extremely hard to believe? Those are the best, you listen to them drinking your beverage, laughing and trying to stick some logic to the events but eventually give up and just enjoy? This one is pretty much like it, but a pressing matter constantly flows in the air, jumps to your face and doesn't rest a minute. This matter is racism.<br/><br/>Spike Lee doesn't allow you to divert your attention from the wrongdoings of white supremacists. It not wrong, but the realism is too cruel. It's hard to watch the movie easily, when you understand all the horrors of racial hatred. The undercover story though is unbelievable and is kind of fun, when you realize that all those ""high standards"" are so easily fooled that no one notices two guys that represent one of the biggest enemies of the clan: Black and Jewish folk respectively, to infiltrate the organization.<br/><br/>I was really impressed by Adam Driver's performance, showing that he can act while acting and his army experience made him even better in portraying a cop. John David Washington stunned by a great range of emotions. Love how all his concerns directly appear on his face, delivering a powerful statement of a man fighting for the right thing.<br/><br/>Throughout many serious moments quite a lot of funny stuff is happening that relieves you from the tension and ridicules the ""organization"".

There is nothing 'cartoonish' (an oft-repeated word among the bad reviews by people who obviously didn't see it, but certainly got their talking points down pat); it tells an important and absolutely true depiction of some evil people luxuriating in their own hatred who wrecked havoc on so many lives for so many years. If the racists in this movie seem one-dimensional, it's because racists ARE one-dimension losers; nothing complex or nuanced about them. A perfect film for the Trump-era, as these same type creeps seem to have come out from under their rocks and now feel newly empowered. This film is an important reminder of what they are capable of."

"Vartiainen","Null","3","9","11 October 2018"," Topical to the extreme
","Based on police officer Ron Stallworth, played by John David Washington, the first black officer to serve in Colorado Springs, and his successful attempt to infiltrate the ranks of Ku Klux Klan. Helmed by the legendary Spike Lee.<br/><br/>As you'd expect, the questions and themes concerning race and race relations are heavily featured. The films speaks for unity and peace, but it's also a cautionary tale about hate and intolerance. The ugliest performances are of course given by the Klan members, but the film does show that the other side had advocates for violence as well. Which is of course natural. We're all human, after all.<br/><br/>And speaking of ugly performances, I have to raise my hat for these actors. Washington, and Adam Driver as Detective Flip Zimmerman, play the two officers doing the infiltration, and they're wonderful, but I can only imagine what it must been like for Topher Grace and Jasper Pääkkönen playing the roles of David Duke , the grand wizard of KKK, and Felix, a psychotic Klan member, respectively. Pääkkönen especially has some truly haunting scenes where he has to spout the most vitriolic, hate-filled, blood mad filth imaginable. Scary performance, I have to admit.<br/><br/>Aside from that the film is very solid on the technical side of things, has a sense of humour and is all around well-told. I did feel that the last act was perhaps a bit more outlandish than it necessarily needed to be. I get that the director wanted a big finale and to raise the stakes, but I wonder whether the focus should have been maintained on the actual issues, which are still ongoing even in today's world. The last minutes focus on those modern day issues, which was a nice finishing touch, but still.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a very good film. It should fill us with shame that such a world of hatred and intolerance still has a place in this day and age. And if this film opens the eyes of even one of its viewers, its existence has been justified."

What a slap in the face for the only good thing about this movie and all the people who served like him.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for the movie.

Lee dramatises what could have been a lost story, and uses it to make his points and parallels between then, and Trump's presidency now. It's crammed down your throat in a hearty, comical, fourth-wall busting way, but if you're watching a Spike Lee film called Blackkklansman, something tells me you'll be expecting it, if not, wishing for it.

","BlacKkKlansman is a film about a true story of how Ron Stallworth infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. It's an interestingly true story, so converting that into a movie equally makes it interesting. BlacKkKlansman is like a breath of fresh air when it comes to movies that speaks on the topic of racism, and there should definitely be more movies such as this one.<br/><br/>BlacKkKlansman is a thrilling movie to watch, even though it's considered to be a drama. Adam Driver's character, Flip Zimmerman is the one who actually meets with the members of the KKK, and most of his interactions with the members are very intense scenes. We're always guessing whether Flip Zimmerman will get caught, and that's what makes the movie so entertaining.<br/><br/>There are a few issues with the movie that do hold it back. The character development of Ron Stallworth and Flip Zimmerman is unbelievably weak. We barely get a story behind both characters, and we rarely see what their lives are like outside of the job. Some of the Klan members even get more exposition than our leading characters. Another issue is with the relationship between Patrice and Ron. They're romantic relationship has such a weak foundation, because of how rarely we see the two together. Giving both characters more detail would've made the final act more intense to watch.<br/><br/>BlacKkKlansman is definitely worth a watch. It's entertaining and intense throughout most acts. Some of the issues with the movie are issues that shouldn't even appear in a film such as this. Overall, BlacKkKlansman is a good movie that expresses a message in a fresh new way; that doesn't feel forced, I definitely recommend watching."
"richarddillomes","7","2","5","7 October 2019"," Everyday human beings doing the extraordinary
","BlacKkKlansman tells the story of Ron Stallworth, the first African-American undercover agent for the Colorado Springs Police Department as he infiltrates the infamous Ku Klux Klan back in the '70s. Not bad for someone that was originally hired to be the poster boy of the CSPD's effort to diversify. Starring John David Washington (son of THE Denzel W.) and Adam Driver (HBO's Girls, Star Wars), we follow them as they take on the dangerous task of finding out if a known hate group with a massive reach and resources has really reformed or is still out for blood for the sole purpose of ""making America great again.""<br/><br/>The movie is very timely considering what's happening in the US: racism has become mainstream again, rising from the shadows from whence they were banish forth. If you think about it, it's true when George Santayana said that 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.' Here we are 50 years later, white supremacy is rearing it's ugly head once again. Depending on which side of the narrative you are, you will feel disgust as the poisonous hate and the creative ways the whites spew like they own the world are never-ending, or if you are a white supremacist you will feel disgust among your colleagues for having been fooled by a tandem of cops, one is Black rookie and the is a non-practicing Jew.<br/><br/>Comparable to last year's The Post, and 2015's Spotlight, BlacKkKlansman will give you your fix of normal, everyday human beings doing the extraordinary in the service of humanity even at the risk of their own life. The difference is amidst taking on a serious and heavy topic, director Spike Lee made sure to put some needed humor so we don't choke on the urgency of what message the movie is trying to convey. I mean if you really think about it, it's not that hard to make fun of those that are so full of themselves they honestly believe they can do no wrong, thinking highly of themselves as the chosen race when the rest of the world looks at them like a joke that write itself (insert Pelosi clapping at Trump.) If anything, I realized sometimes you really have to see destruction first because from there, only better things will come. If from all this hate and death we will see another Marthin Luther King Jr. rise from the ashes or Obama become a world leader again, maybe it will make it all worth it."

","Generally speaking a lighthearted story about racism, with lots of tongue in cheek jokes and a few dark and cruel racist scenes as well. The story is based on real events about 2 cops, one white, one black, who went undercover in a racist organisation in the seventies. Did they succeed in bringing racists to justice by going undercover? That is the cliffhanger of this story.<br/><br/>Direction is ok, acting as well and the story is quite interesting because it was based on real events that happened in the seventies. Any bad? Well, not really, only 1 thing at the very end. What took me off guard is what happened at the end (last 10 minutes) of this movie. It hammered down a political correct message from politics from today by showing some explicit violent REAL LIFE news footage about race riots. Why does Spike Lee do that? His message at the end is superfluous in my opinion and only substracts from the powerful fictional story that has already just been told about racism in the seventies.<br/><br/>This weird choice to start mixing real life news footage from today in a fictional movie really is in bad taste in my opinion. Never seen it done before in this blunt way. Make a fictional movie OR make a documentary. Make a choice. Really downer ending in an otherwise decent picture about racism in the seventies."

"Mike_Devine","7","2","5","23 March 2019"," Spike Lee goes for the gold - and delivers
","Spike Lee is known for translating difficult stories into cinema, and 'BlacKkKlansman' is no different. In what is one of the most interesting and head-scratching tales from the civil rights movement, Lee brings us the story of Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs' first African-American police officer, who also is part of a covert team that infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>One of the biggest surprises in 'BlacKkKlansman' is the job John David Washington does as the aforementioned Officer Stallworth. The son of a film legend and a relative newcomer to acting, Washington has everything down from the accent to the look to - most importantly - the quick wit needed to outsmart a bunch of backhills racists. Joining him on this journey is Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), a Jewish officer who is also an unconventional choice to take down the KKK.<br/><br/>The film is many things all at once - a crime drama, a dark comedy, a time travel back to a different era - and it delivers on all of these points. Through the eyes of Stallworth, the audience can identify with the personal struggle he experiences, trying to be a black cop in an all-white force with few friends or believers, while also straddling the line when it comes to sticking to his roots, including the young civil rights movement led by Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier).<br/><br/>'BlacKkKlansman' also earned Lee his first Oscar, for best adapted screenplay - incredible to believe given his long career. It is not the best (nor is it his best) effort, but it's a well done film that tells a crazy story in a unique way."

"Jazzie-too","2","2","5","26 February 2019"," Disappointing!
","I was expecting so much more! Validity, for one. Since Barbara Streisand introduced it at the AA show and then, later, supposedly Spike Lee was upset it did not win--I thought it would be a most credible and gripping story involving the horridness of the KKK. Without being told or shown anything, we should know the horridness of the KKK. I don't get how so much hate can be allowed to thrive in its assembly of members under the protection of ""civil rights"". Really?! I'm very disappointed in some of the absurdities of the story. I was so afraid that either of the undercover characters were going to be discovered and they would meet with an ugly end.
The KKK still exists today. I think a more current depiction would have better served the cause and expose the ugliness of racism. And it is UGLY! And it is thriving. It is subtle or it is boisterous! Plain ugly! And we DO judge people by the color of their skin or national origin--until we possibly get to know them. Sad reality! This movie did not get that across. Those ""dumb"" ole boys were rather hideous.
I will say, that the ""black side"" of the story was more credible in its presentation. When they chanted ""Black Power"", it was palpable and much more credible. It would have served us all, had it been more, in essence, like ""Spotlight"", which delivered an equally troubling and horrific truth. Well, that's my take anyway. Come on Spike, you can do better! And we need to find ways to move forward--together. PS: I don't get how David Duke could master so much power and following if, in reality, he was such a ding-a-ling in his earlier days.

"leonblackwood","6","2","5","20 February 2019"," Typical Spike Lee movie but a shocking true story! 6/10
","Review:
Being a black man, I did find the language in this movie quite disturbing, along with the intense subject matter, but I should have known what to expect from a Spike Lee film. As it's based on true events, I did find the storyline quite shocking, so I was glad to see that Spike Lee added some wit to lighten the mood. With the horrific events that happened during the Unite the Right Tally in 2017, in Charlottesville Virginia, I can't believe that these ignorant individuals still have the same mindset as when this film was based, in 1970. I was impressed with the performances, and Spike Lee captured the period quite well, but it's Ron Stallworth's true story that made the movie entertaining. Anyway, in the early 1970s, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), is hired as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department, assigned to work in the records room. He faces racial slurs from his co-workers, so he requests to be transferred to do undercover work. After being turned down, he is assigned to infiltrate a local rally where national civil rights leader Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins), gives a speech. At the rally, Ron meets Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), president of the black student union at Colorado College. After the rally, Ron is reassigned to the intelligence division. Whilst reading the local paper, he sees an ad about a local division of the Ku Klux Klan, so he calls them, posing as a white person, and he speaks to Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold), the president of the Colorado Springs chapter. Ron recruits his Jewish coworker, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), to act as him during a meet with the Klan members. Flip meets Walter, the more reckless Felix Kendrickson (Jasper Paakkonen), and Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser), who cryptically refers to an upcoming attack. Ron begins regular phone conversations with Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace), after trying to push forward his Klan membership. Ron begins dating Patrice, but he decides not to tell her that he is a police officer. Meanwhile, Duke visits Colorado Springs for Ron's induction into the Klan, but the Real Ron is assigned to a protection detail for the Duke. While Flip is masquerading as Ron, Felix's wife Connie (Ashlie Atkinson), leaves the ceremony to place a bomb at a civil rights rally. Ron realises her intentions, and he alerts local police officers. When Connie notices a heavy police presence at the rally, she goes to plant the bomb at Patrice's house instead, which was the pre-arranged Plan B. When she is unable to fit the bomb in her mailbox, she puts it on Patrice's car instead, but Ron tackles her as she tries to flee. Whilst trying to detain Connie, Ron is confronted by uniformed police officers, who beat him despite his protest that he is working undercover. Bombmaker Walker (Nicholas Turturro) recognises Flip from a prior arrest, and he goes to trigger the bomb with Felix and Ivanhoe, not realising were Connie hid it, and are killed in the explosion. Flip arrives and frees Ron, and Connie is arrested. Police Chief Bridges (Robert John Duke) congratulates the team for their success but orders them to destroy the records. Ron receives a call from Duke, and he reveals that he is black before hanging up. I liked the tribute to Prince at the end, and you actually get to see the real Ron Stallworth, who talks about the true events in the bonus material. Judging by the average box office takings, I can understand if people would be put off by the subject matter, and the fact that the first few scenes show black people be treated terribly, really is off-putting. Once the undercover action gets going, it does become interesting, and quite amusing in parts, but I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth, especially after seeing the real footage of the Unite the Right Rally. In all, it's worth a watch but you have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Spike Lee, who also brought you She's Gotta Have It in 1986, School Daze, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues, Jungle Fever, Malcolm X, Crooklyn, Clockers, Girl 6, He Got Game, Summer Of Sam, 25th Hour, Inside Man, Miracle At St. Anna, Oldboy and Chi-Raq. Personally, I'm not a big fan of his work, mainly because of his controversial directing style which always ends with a debate. Some of his work, like Inside Man, Summer Of Sam and 25th Hour, were straight forward, without a hidden message, so I was actually able to enjoy them but the rest were only worth a one watch. His biggest earner to date was Inside Man, with $88million at the box office, so his movies don't really break records but he's still highly respected, even though he has made some enemies along the way.<br/><br/>Budget: $15million
Worldwide Gross: $90.5million<br/><br/>Genre: Biography, Crime, Drama
Cast: John David Washington, Adam Driver, Topher Grace, Robert John Burke, Michael Buscemi, Laura Harrier, Jasper Paakkonen, Danny Hoch, Alec Baldwin, Nicholas Turturro, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Brian Tarantina, Ken Garito, Frederick Weller, Corey Hawkins and Harry Belafonte. 6/10"

"donaldricco","7","2","5","7 January 2019"," Read the book first!
","To begin, the book, as almost always, is better than the film. This review is for the movie, which I am considering ends at the cross burning. The footage at the end is amazing, powerful, and indicting, but not part of the movie proper, in my opinion. To which -<br/><br/>The movie is ok. It doesn't really deal with the actual plot of the title until about a half an hour in, which didn't really make sense to me. The speech at the beginning is awesome, but has very little to do with Stallworth's overall investigation. And with all the new pieces the filmmaker added to the plot, the actual investigation itself seems watered down in here. Even the great scene with Harry Belafonte juxtaposed with the KKK ceremony feels like a separate event than the investigation. The movie just stops to let these amazing speeches occur, and I wish they had their own, separate, spotlight. In my opinion.
Just like the ending news footage. Watching the real David Duke, the horrible Donald Trump, and the footage from Charlottesville slam home that the KKK and their kind are still here, and very much alive! I cried at the end. It just felt that though it all is connected by the same message, it wasn't part of the movie. Just my opinion.
Also kudos to Mr. Lee for NOT being in the film. He is such a bad actor, and I'm glad he was able to stay out of this one. Conversely, shame on him for using that horrible film technique of his, where the character(s) seem to be on a dolly and moving forward in a type of slow motion. It still sucks, no matter how many years he's used it."
"cinthiardgs","5","2","5","2 December 2018"," good movie but...
","This movie is about the KKK (a clan created after the 1861-1865 the Civil War. We must know these people are racist and they hate black people. So Spike Lee, the film director cas inspired and decided to make this film. In reality, it a bad movie because it shows real things at that time, it's very thought-provoking but in the same time it funny and entertaining. I liked very much this film because it is based on a true story. One of the things I didn't like is the part when Patrice was arrested with her friends and the policeman touched her body. This part is striking and made me angry because it's very upsetting. The policeman shouldn't have done that with Patrice because she's a black girl! Nevertheless the script is compelling and eye-opening on Black people's lives at the 20th century; the USA was a country without equality, heart; even if the KKK hasn't disappeared but today I think it's a little bit better. It's an absolute must-see"
"timaru-00770","6","2","5","2 December 2018"," Gripping, eye-opening but quite tedious and ridiculous
","First, I think that the actors' performance is very good, especially Adam Driver as Flip. Besides, the film has some quite funny moments and on the other hand, some upsetting and moving moments, wich make a very good mixture. But sometimes, especially with Laura Harrier as Patrice, I found the film boring and also not at all realistic. So, from my point of view, the members of the KKK are ridiculous. Thereby, the film can't be taken seriously when the villains in the movie are very cliché. It looks like a comedy, not a realistic film, which wants to be convincing. Even if the cast is great, it needs to be more serious. Besides, the film has a surpising ending, which I think is interesting because the script is very smart. On a scale of 0 to 10, i give this film a six because even if there is a good cast and a good script, sometimes it's long and slow. I can recommend it because the storyline is good and creative, and also because Adam Driver is one of the lead characters. Fans of him must see his great performance ! And Finally, the soundtrack is compelling and corresponds to the film."

","As a finn, I just have to begin this review from a supporting cast standpoint. The character of Felix Kendrickson, an aggressive KKK member, is played by my fellow countryman Jasper Pääkkönen. You certainly wouldn't want to bump into Felix in a dark alley. Pääkkönen has actually played a somewhat similar character in a finnish film called Leijonasydän (Heart of a Lion), a really well made 2013 film about neo-nazis.<br/><br/>But back to the BlacKkKlansman...Spike Lee's newest joint starts with images from Gone with the Wind and evolves into an important film about a touchy subject, hopefully this film will be another step forward in the battle against racism. The premise of the story, while being about a serious issue, is giggle worthy - the plan of an african-american police officer infiltrating Ku Klux Klan doesn't necessarily sound like the best of ideas -it's kind of a ""lets wing it"" type of deal. The movie is a part comedy but it is tonally a bit more serious than the what the trailers had me anticipating. I also felt that there were a couple of instances where the movie's history telling interfered the pacing and thrillingness of the actual story. BlacKkKlansman has laughs, thrills, importance, shock value and nice portrayal of the period, but for me the film didn't quite come together in the way I would've liked. Still, it's a good film and I'll be watching it again at some point for sure.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

"tgkfalcons","7","2","5","29 August 2018"," BlacKkKlansman: A Very Expensive Middle Finger
","BlacKkKlansman was an interesting movie to me. For one, I, a person of mixed race, saw it with my mother and her boyfriend, both of whom are black, and I brought my friend, who happens to be white, along with us. The movie revolves around this rookie cop, the first black officer in the history of his town's department, going undercover along with a partner to infiltrate their town's chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. From the beginning of the film, the movie keeps up a vivacious and infectious energy, with an enjoyable soundtrack and, in my opinion, killer theme song (which admittedly gets played a bit too much) that keeps your attention focused solely on the screen. The camerawork is slick and the dialogue is smart and witty, truly marking it as A Spike Lee Joint. The actors do a fine job for the most part (sans the chief), and they are truly able to sell their characters as people that exist in a community rocked with political discourse and fraught with racial tension. For all the film has going for it though, there are some elements of the film that I'm not a fan of. For instance, there are several moments in the film where the plot has to take a grinding halt so that the audience can get the reference Spike Lee is trying to make through dialogue (LIGHT SPOILER: There's one particularly memorable scene where the main character is talking to a seargant and he says something along the lines of ""Do you really think that somebody like David Duke could get elected President of the United States?"" The whole back-and-forth is quite funny, but there are quite a few moments like that in BlacKkKlansman, where what's happening in the story has to take a backseat to some sort of joke or stance Spike Lee wants his characters to make. While the film does have an infectious energy, is does waver in intensity. There are moments where the tension is so powerful you don't even breathe. and then there are moments where you could easily check your phone or eat your theater snack for a few moments and not miss a single thing. The movie does have a slight habit of repeating information that's already been given to us before, not quite to the point where it's annoying, but certainly at a noticeable level. There are a couple shots, especially towards the back half of the film, that seem to linger for just a second too long, as if Spike Lee thinks that the only way the message will be impactful is if it's on screen for an entire act of the movie. But probably my biggest gripe, and it's moreso personal than anything else really, is that there are several large scenes dedicated to showing black folk rising up and demanding equality and respect from their white peers, echoing in the footsteps of Malcolm X and the Black Panther Party, and while I understand why Spike Lee includes it in the film and how it adds to the overall narrative and helps to create a dichotomy and a better understanding of how people thought at the time, I personally just felt like it took away from the overall story. They hardly affect the investigation at all, doesn't really add much plot-wise, and while the organization itself gets targeted quite a lot by the Klan in the film, the specific actions of those involved and what the group does doesn't really add much to what's happening. If those scenes were cut out from the film and replaced with more scenes of the investigation, or maybe some character development for the main character, the other cops in the precinct, and even the Klan members, I might've favored the film more. The Klan members in particular seem to have the least depth in the movie, lots of times being reduced to silly dialogue that makes them sound like they belong in a PSA about racism given out to college students. I understand that racism isn't logical in the slightest, and is built on a lot of resentment and anger and faulty history lessons, but none of the Klan members seemed to even have somewhat of an understandable reason for acting the way they do. With all of that being said, the movie was quite fun, I'd definitely watch it again if I got the chance, and I give this a low 7.5/10."

","Back in the 1970s, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) was the first African-American police officer and later detective in the Colorado Springs police department. Working with a Jewish-American associate Philip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), they infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan which had been trying to become respectable. Stallworth initiated the contact by purchasing a membership by mail and calling national director David Duke (Topher Grace) on the telephone. (Stallworth still carries his membership card in his wallet.) Zimmerman became involved when the situation called for personal contact and especially when Duke himself visited the local chapter. The plot emphasizes a scheme for the likable wife (Ashlie Atkinson) of a local Klan member (Jasper Paakkonen) to plant a bomb at a student rally, but comes at the expense of a romance between Stallworth and Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), a student at Colorado College in Colorado Springs and president of the Black Students Union. Harry Belafonte appears in a cameo in which his character describes a 1916 lynching that he personally witnessed, and Alec Baldwin in one in which he appears in a Public Service Announcement decrying integration, racial intermarriage, and the influence of Jews on the Supreme Court. Spike Lee directed and co-wrote the screenplay based on Stallworth's 2014 memoir Black Klansman, and he was nominated for Academy Awards in both categories and won the latter. His long-time collaborator Terence Blanchard was also nominated for Best Score."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","11","2 October 2018"," Interesting movie and the fact it's based on actual events makes it even better
","""BlacKkKlansman"" is a new American 2018 movie and the most recent filmmaking effort by Spike Lee who directed here and is also part of a relatively big team of writers that used Ron Stallworth's novel as the basis for this very long film at 2 hours and 15 minutes. Maybe the actor who plays the main character John David Washington will not be too familiar to you, but Adam Driver sure should, actually even without his Star Wars performances. And yes I think that Stallworth is the protagonist here, not just because it is based on his novel, but also because we find out a whole lot more about him than about everybody else, also Flip, for example when it comes to romantic love interests. The latter includes the scenes with the radical Blacks and while I liked these scenes I also felt that the film would not have been considerably worse without them. But they served as a good counterpart to the KKK scenes nonetheless and this refers to one occasion especially when there is really a direct parallel between their two meetings when we find out about both groups' motivations and intentions. This was maybe the highlight of the entire film. You could write a whole lexikon about these 10 minutes or so. Of course, having Harry Belafonte in charge of telling the Black story helps a whole lot and he was mesmerizing without a doubt, even or maybe especially at the age of 90. But also aside from him, these two conventions offered so much material in terms of the women's role in these, or the references about violence or the whole idea what happens/would happen if either group found out they were infiltrated by a cop. Maybe the revelation moment was not the greatest, but it wasn't bad either, just not as significant as it could have been. Then again, we need to keep in mind this is based on real events. It's not ""Breaking Bad"". I think the performances were with no exception good in here, especially by those playing the KKK members. There was so much absurdity for example in the romantic scene between one KKK member and his wife when we really see what unites them the most in their love for each other is the hatred against others. Well-acted and well-written is the perfect description there and for many other moments. And even if it was such a long film, it never dragged to me.<br/><br/>Yeah well, I could have done without the awkwardly bizarre Alec Baldwin introduction and also without most of the references to our days at the very end, but those weren't that bad either that they left a truly negative impact on the film. The David Duke today scene at the very end was a welcome inclusion though, just because his character was so dominant in the movie, not really in terms of screen time, but in terms of how memorable he was. Another very positive moment staying in the mind was the shot in which we see Stallworth at the shooting area minutes after the KKK members (and Driver's character) were there and we don't see what they were shooting at until Stallworth enters the scene and is somewhat united with his brothers who are targets there and surely many of the KKK members would have preferred them to be actually living targets. With many hot political debates on immigration, this film, even if it is set decades back in the past, feels relevant nowadays too and it was probably the right time for it to be made. I think I read a few weeks back that this is a contender for Best Picture at the Oscars even, but I think the buzz went a bit down. That's fine though as while it is a good film, I doubt it's really best of the year material. But it is good for what it is. Maybe you should rather think about the question if the subject is interesting enough to you than going by the trailer because while Driver's chair turning scene may be hilarious when Washington starts rambling on the phone about how he hates Blacks and non-Whites it's really not as much of a comedy as you might think from the trailer. At least my impression. But that is fine as it would have been worse if they had gone more for a comedy, but ended up fishing for laughs without delivering the quality in that genre. If you know a bit about Spike Lee, then you know what to expect here, although even with the references to the now at the very end, it is certainly not even close to being his most radical movie. But without having seen too much from him I think it is a contender for his best and it sure has a shot at becoming his most popular too. The story makes sense and those rare moments when I wasn't sure like when I wondered why the Nazi guy did not recognize the bodyguard from the door visit earlier, they developed the story in a way that he did eventually. Or the saving from the lie detector test which was pretty spectacular. As was the eventual bomb scene with the explosion too that despite how key of the story it was never really felt too impactful to me to be honest. However, the film delivers sufficiently during many other scenes and moments and I am thankful for that. I am not even close to regretting having seen this one and I think you should go for the watch too. I give ""BlacKkKlansman"" a thumbs-up and positive recommendation."

","This is the worst Spike Lee joint I've ever seen. I haven't bothered with his pointless ""Oldboy"" remake, but this one may be his worse either way. The first half of the movie is actually not bad, its pretty entertaining and intriguing. The second half however, goes off the rails and is incredibly unfocused and dare I say cartoonish. The tone of this movie seems to attempt to be comedic at many moments, even though the content is quite serious and should be handled more appropriately. Otherwise, it needed to be a straight up farcical comedy. I belive its inspired by a true story, but Lee obviously took many liberties. I dont even touch on the plot holes and continuity errors. At about the hour and a half mark I was waiting impatiently for this film to end. The soundtrack in this movie is headache inducing and unnecessary, Lee never allows a scene to breathe and moments that should be tense are directed so poorly that there is no tension at all. If Spike Lee hadn't directed this, thered be no way it would have been nominated for best picture. There is some entertainment value in this movie, and the acting from the leads is pretty good, but at over 2 hours long, this movie really isn't worth ones time. I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone, I expected something better from such a great director."

The footage at the end, although powerful was poorly transitioned into and had little to do with the last scene in the movie which featured a Charlie's Angels styled gun posing by the protagonists.

"antoniokowatsch","6","2","6","12 December 2018"," Entertaining but factually wrong
","I have to say, this was a really funny and entertaining movie. However, as someone who knows the actual story I have some rather harsh criticism to share. First off I'd like to state that I'm half-black and that I know David Duke, just to give you some perspective. While the movie was fun to watch it was very inaccurate as far as the facts are concerned. There was no terror attack/mail bomb and the police officer Flip wasn't Jewish. He was a Christian. Spike Lee basically sensationalized the whole thing. If you don't believe me go and read the book that this movie was ""vaguely"" based on. I mean, the story in itself was interesting enough, there's really no need for sensationalizing it like this. Also, I like how they constantly joke around and ridicule the ""conspiracy theory"" that Jews are over-represented in positions of power. It's not a conspiracy theory, it's the statistical truth.
Towards the end the movie segued into video footage from the Charlottesville riot and other racially charged attacks. Nice appeal to emotion, I see what you did there. The only problem is; leftist extremist are actually more violent than the few right extremists who are insane enough to drive a car into a crowd. They are not just more violent but also legion. There are so many of them that it's quite scary. Especially in European countries like Germany, where I'm currently residing. The European Antifa is akin to a terror organization. They're highly organized and very dangerous.
I'm not saying that racism does not exist. All I'm saying is that it isn't really a big issue anymore. Through constant perpetuation of these ""lores"" we're entrapping the generations to come in a literal prison for the mind. Spike Lee, just like Tyler Perry, are basically just exploiting black culture for financial gain. The only reason why they've gotten away with it over all these years is because they're black themselves. Overall, however, they've been a net negative influence on the black community. I obviously don't condone it.<br/><br/>The inverted American Flag at the end was straight up disrespectful, there's something called the Flag protocol according to which this act is classified as ""flag desecration"".<br/><br/>To conclude: the movie was good but don't believe everything that you see. If I didn't know it any better I'd call it a modern propaganda flick.
When lies are being fought with lies you know that you've officially entered the post-truth era."
"judeknicks","8","2","6","6 September 2018"," Entertaining, but not quite amazing
","I never wish to address politics, but I feel like Hollywood has made more socially-conscious movies ever since President Trump was inaugurated in office. It may be a coincidence, but I don't think so. In 2018 alone, there have been three major movies that have dealt with racial inequality. We first had Sorry To Bother You, which was tremendously overhyped and overall a bad movie. Then we had Blindspotting, which was an excellent and realistic look at the injustice that people of color often face. Now, we have Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman, which has been showered with praise. While not perfect, it certainly has plenty of quality moments that overshadow it's lack of a plot objective. Let us begin.<br/><br/>The story of the film focuses on Ron Stallworth (a most entertaining John David Washington), a rookie African-American cop on Colorado Springs who decides to open an investigation on the KKK. Stallworth communicates with them through the phone using his ""white-voice"", and fellow cop Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver, who did great) meets with them face-to-face. What makes the movie so engaging is the dynamic between the two cops and the concept of acting as someone else. The phone conversations between Stallworth and the KKK alone provided many great moments. As if that weren't entertaining enough, the scenes at the meetings were well-executed and engaging, if not very sad. All of the major-billed actors, with the exception of Stallworth's girlfriend Patrice (played by Spider Man's girl in Homecoming), performed very well, especially John David Washington and Corey Hawkins (Kwame Ture was his character). During the scene with Ture, it was an empowering moment for the film to highlight the faces of the crowd and the true statement that ""Black is Beautiful"". However, there were a few aspects that prevented this film from being amazing. Allow me to explain<br/><br/>I've stated the importance of a clear plot before, and that is where BlacKkKlansman falters most. The movie just does not have a clear plot; there isn't a purpose to the investigation except to highlight that the KKK is racist. They are absolutely corrupt in the mind, but what they do technically isn't illegal. Throughout the course of the investigation, the Stallworth Brothers (as Ron says) try to uncover a plan for an attack; they talk about doing things, but they never create or carry out any plans. This hurts the film because the investigations never lead anywhere. They just show what KKK members do during their meetups, which is basically drinking beer, chatting about life, and being racist. Basically, they are frat and f**k boys. The lack of an objective hurts the film the most, along with the poorly executed remembrance of the Charlottesville protests.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After seeing the trailers, I had been excited and looked forward to seeing BlacKkKlansman and even more so after seeing all the rave reviews. Once again, reading reviews prior to seeing a movie set high expectations that weren't quite met. I was highly entertained and found this film to be one of the funniest films of the year, but this is largely credited to the character, chemistry, and two-in-one dynamic between Ron Stallworth and Flip Zimmerman. They, however, did not have a specific objective with the investigation, which is what the movie focuses on. Overall, I would say that this film is worth your $12 to see it in theaters. After watching John David Washington in Ballers and this film, he is definitely a star in the making. Maybe one day he'll reach the level of his dad Denzel; he was easily the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Rating wise, I would say that this movie deserves an 8 out of 10. If only all movies so close to being amazing just had a definitive plot."

","I thought this film was going to be good with a very interesting cast and interesting subject. This film did have some positive moments specifically its funny scenes but in the end it lost its fissile.<br/><br/>In a quick summary the film drags out and the story doesn't lead to much of anything interesting with very obvious political statements being made. Racists are bad and stupid and we would be foolish to elect one to president.<br/><br/>In the end the finale is utterly stupid at best while the revealing of Adam Drivers character as a Jewish cop leads to no consequences and is just passed by.

"bbewnylorac","6","2","6","30 August 2018"," Could have been much better
","BlackkKlansman has a great cast, wonderful sets and costumes and raises some important social issues.
It's a shame that the script is so undeveloped. Many of the scenes go on way too long, or don't have much purpose, and there is too much dialogue. Generally the film isn't entertaining enough - too much talk and not enough action. Which is a pity, because the plot is great - a black police detective Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan by phone, and sends a Jewish fellow detective, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to go undercover to Klan meetings, under Stallworth's name. Washington is fantastic - intelligent, laidback, bold and sensitive. As is Driver, who must act like a white supremicist as the Klan grill him about his views on blacks and Jews. As the black student leader Patrice, Laura Harrier is fabulous, although often she's more the love interest, and her love affair with Stallworth seems more a series of cute scenes that don't amount to much. The film's ending is confusing, and finally cute, and isn't very smooth.
Stallworth deserves more recognition for his courage - there's a great scene where he applies to be his city's first black police officer, and the film does portray some of the immense danger of that, when even some of his workmates were hostile to him, and he had to straddle his black social life and the white police culture. I guess the filmmakers at least had a go at covering some of the myriad issues relating to racism in America. But if they had taken more time, they could have made a really good film."

","There is much to like about this film, but I only give it a 6/10, blaming most of the negative aspects on Spike Lee's direction. There are more than a few very good acting performances: Washington and Driver, and several of the Klansman, especially the husband-wife duo (especially when contrasted to the poor acting of the ""bad cop"" character). But Topher Grace as David Duke is a great, spot-on portrayal of the smarmy, ""marketable"" klansman David Duke.. I was less convinced by the love interest/student activist and her relationship with Washington's character. The film suffers from an identity crisis, not knowing whether to be a drama or a comedy. This would have been a better story to be made as dark comedy (maybe like ""I, Tonya"" (9/10)), or maybe an action, suspense drama. But instead it meanders throughout much of the film. When it's good, this film is superb, but there is much dead time in it. The long speeches greatly slow down the pacing of the film (and I'm NOT a person with a short cinematic attention span - I love ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the wedding scene in ""The Deer Hunter""). A second long speech is a lost opportunity to build suspense. Lee tries but fails to build that suspense, with cinematic tools he should know how to use by now. Lee's attempts to tie the 70's Klan to Trump were forced and at times insulted the intelligence of the audience (Did he really think he had to repeat a Trump catch-phrase over and over and over . . . or we'd somehow be too stupid to get his point?). Factually,.this former Colorado Springs resident can accept (for cinematic reasons) moving the mostly flat city of Colorado Springs to the hills (Spike's city looks more like neighboring Manitou Springs). At least the Black Student Union sign was written in the correct Colorado College Colors. Go Tigers."

","Spike Lee is someone a generation has grown up with, and whether you love his work or note, it does definitely make you think and brings to the forefront issues of society, race & class, as well as opportunity. Sometimes very inciteful and educational (Jungle Fever & Do The Right Thing) but sometimes just crude political point scoring. This film seems to straddle between those two BUT more towards the first.<br/><br/>What we have is the unbelievable but true story in the 1970s of African American Ron Stallworth who infiltrated the far-right US movement. Working with his colleagues, over the course of the case he finds out their plans and works to stop them, is in a relationship with a young headstrong but politically engaged black women and is battling bureaucracy & bigotry in his own police department.<br/><br/>Despite the dark nature of the story, Spike Lee does a good job in plastering lots of comedy throughout to lighten the tone to make it all the more digestible for a wider audience than otherwise. Admittedly he is too biased in some ways, there are extremist elements on the African American who seem to get away without any questioning, whilst all in the are treated as cliched hill-billies whereas reality of late shows them to be far more serious than that. Don't get me wrong, the director & writer do a great job in tackling various subjects, and the main point is showing that bigotry can be defeated with action by people on the ground.<br/><br/>It's well filmed and entertaining, and (not a spoiler) i enjoyed a closing montage of recent political aspects. There are a number of themes of late that are important as the far-right globally has been taking a greater hold of the vote. This film won't answer the questions, but will help discussions to continue. That's the good point.<br/><br/>Must add that the cast as a whole is very watchable, including the omnipresent Adam Driver! Possibly the hardest working man in film today it seems.<br/><br/>It's a fine film (with some flaws), but still very watchable."

"burlesonjesse5","7","1","2","14 November 2018"," VIEWS ON FILM review of BlacKkKlansman
","Yup, I'm a fan of Spike Lee. Ever since I saw 1995's Clockers, he has been appointment movie time for me. Spike shoots films that other helmers would be hard pressed to touch. His work is involving, absorbing, compulsively watchable, and messy. In truth, I expect that familiar Terence Blanchard film score whenever a quote unquote, ""Spike Lee Joint"" is released. I also expect the obligatory Spike Lee cameo even though I can kinda do without it. Finally, I expected and got Isiah Whitlock Jr. giving us his patented catchphrase. You know, he's the actor that always says ""sheee-t"".<br/><br/>In BlacKkKlansman (my latest review), Lee opens the proceedings with a clip from Gone with the Wind (I'm not kidding). The director then chronicles the true story of one Ron Stallworth. Stallworth was the first African-American detective in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Also in the early 70's, Ron managed to infiltrate and uncover central Colorado's infamous Ku Klux Klan. On a side note, the character of Stallworth is played effectively by John David Washington (he happens to be Denzel Washington's son). When you watch John David move through BlacKkKlansman with big head of hair and strut in tote, you're reminded of his dad via Spike Lee's He Got Game from twenty years ago.<br/><br/>Like with most Spike Lee endeavors, there is controversy, race-related humor, and plot over plot mechanics. BlacKkKlansman is controversial with its uncomfortable racial epithets yet it's about as straightforward and non-violent a story as Lee has ever concocted (except for maybe 2006's Inside Man). Spike doesn't push the envelope here and at 135 minutes, he only scratches the surface of what unpleasantness BlacKkKlansman could've become.<br/><br/>Oh well. The actors pull you through (especially Topher Grace as a quirky David Duke and the chameleon-like Adam Driver), Spike's go-to cinematic tricks are intact, and BlacKkKlansman's message of hate and racism is relevant today as it was in 1970. How do I know this? Well all you gotta do is check out the ending news footage Lee provides in the form of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. It ups the ante on an otherwise behaviorally tamed flick early on. My rating: 3 stars."

Where this movie slips up is just how heavy handed it is. Spike Lee tries so hard to make this THE movie of 2018; the movie that tackles Trump and tackles racism more head on than any movie recently, but instead of Spike Lee's attempts coming off as relevant and ""important"", it mostly comes off as annoying. Don't get me wrong, I agree with what Spike Lee was trying to say, but did he have to beat me over the head with the obvious themes of the film and then scream them into my face. Spike Lee needs to learn what subtly is. Also, this movie tries to be funny in many places, but mostly all the jokes just don't land.<br/><br/>Like I said, I liked this move but it's not the best movie of the year like a lot of critics are making it out to be.

Washington uses a accent that comes off as a bit strange at times but it doesn't take away from a good performance. Some scenes are a bit random and don't serve much to the overall plot. There are a few times where the camera work leaves you scratching your head but that's pretty true to most Spike Lee movies"

"PyroSikTh","8","2","7","13 August 2019"," This is Not Just a Movie
","If I'm being honest, I always struggle reviewing movies that tackle racism in America. For starters I'm not American, so it doesn't quite hit as close to home as it maybe intends. More than that I'm white, and I live in a majorly white area. I've never experienced that kind of treatment, so I admit it makes it hard to empathise sometimes. But no movie has created as much turmoil of approach for me as this one. I'm not Spike Lee's biggest fan, on a personal level. I feel he makes too much about his race, and his protests often just come across as childish rather than passionate, but I don't want to get too deep into that. His movies often tackle difficult subject matter, especially those that cover the plights of the black community. My issue is that I'm not entirely confident I received the message he was trying to tell.<br/><br/>Okay, so the movie is about Ron Stallworth, Colorado Springs' first black police officer in the 70s. He infiltrates the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan with the help of his Jewish colleague. A mixture of hilarity and tension ensues from the situations the characters find themselves in. But Lee also adds in a completely fictional character to add a black point of view, I guess, in Patrice. Honestly I have no idea what his intent is with her character. I can imagine to many of the black community she is represented as a hero, but to me I found her to be almost as bad as the Ku Klux Klan. I'm torn because I don't see Spike Lee (or what I know of him) to intentionally put in a black character for us to root against. I don't see the point he's making with her. Is he trying to appeal to those who paint the police as the villains? Is he trying to pin the blame on the police force himself? Or is he genuinely attempting a more partisan position by showing that black people can have outrageous and generalised views of the 'opposition' as well? Because that last one is how it came off to me, and yet doesn't fit the general theme of the movie at all. Maybe this confusion was exactly his intent.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is solid through and through. It's smartly written, and full of subtle callbacks you wouldn't pick up on without dissecting the film. The most poignant, especially as a film reviewer, was the subject of films and their impact on the race issue. At one point Ron is debating with Patrice about blaxploitation movies of the 70s. He finds the humour and entertainment in them, while she sees them as offensive, and he remarks that they're only movies. True enough, they are, made purely for entertainment value and to appeal to the black audiences of the time. But later on in the movie Ron witnesses a KKK meeting where they enjoy The Birth of a Nation with a racist uproar. The KKK in the movie are portrayed as all American heroes and the KKK watching it celebrate this like a party. At that point it's not just a movie. It's propaganda. It's the celebration and normalisation of racism. This is a very important point to make, not just about BlacKkKlansman, but about movies in general. Sometimes movies are not just movies. Sometimes there are agendas behind them. Sometimes they're used to fuel movements and steer public opinion. Lee wants you to know this while watching this movie so that you can't just shrug it off as 'just a movie'. He wants you to pay attention to what he's saying, because it's important.<br/><br/>Another thing I wasn't sure of on the initial watch of this movie was the very end, but I'm definitely coming around to it being somewhat a stroke of genius. The movie has finished, the characters have had everything resolved (for the most part), and this is where the credits would roll. Except they don't. Instead we cut to real life footage from 2017 in Charlottesville. We see the real David Duke on a podium speaking in support of Trump and making America great again, not even attempting to hide his racism. In the middle of this we cut to rallies and marches, both from white supremacists, and the black lives matter movement. It all culminates in footage of a car charging through a crowd of black lives matter supporters, and a dedication to the woman who died as a result of it. My initial impression was slightly irksome. It took me out of the movie entirely, and I didn't immediately see why it was included. It felt like a curveball. It felt irrelevant. But as I thought about it more I realised the point it was making. BlacKkKlansman is the story of racism in the 70s, but this racism didn't just go away. The KKK didn't just disband and change their minds. They're still around today. They're still making an impact today. They're still violently assaulting people in the streets today. Including these real-life clips at the end reinforces that the message being told in this movie is important - today. It's not just important history to know about, because it's not just history. It's still happening.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is top-notch as well from everyone involved. John David Washington (son of Denzel) definitely deserves praise for his performance as Ron Stallworth. He holds a natural charisma that makes it hard not to like him. He eases into the performance and makes it so natural that it's easy to forget he's not the real Ron Stallworth. Particular standout moments include his subtle facial reactions to the racism he suffers, particularly early on in the movie, but also later when he's assigned as bodyguard duty for David Duke. Talking of, Topher Grace was exceptional as the charming, down-to-Earth Duke. He definitely embodies that everyman feel that enabled Duke to infiltrate the hearts of Americans. He doesn't come across as a racist at all until his racist remarks start to sneak into his dialogue. Corey Hawkins' small appearance as Kwame Ture is also great, as he delivers a speech to the local black community to inspire them to take a stance and fight back against the systemic racism they suffer on a daily basis. While some of what he says is a bit extreme, Hawkins delivers it in such a way that it's inspirational, and the potential extremism in his words is lost.<br/><br/>Adam Driver deserves a bunch of recognition here as well, as Flip Zimmerman, the white detective helping Stallworth out as the white face of Ron Stallworth, KKK sympathiser. His character arc is subtle, but also a very important aspect of the movie for non-black people to latch on to. Zimmerman is a Jewish character, which is another race of people disliked by the KKK. However, being white, this aspect of Zimmerman's identity never had much of an impact on him. He was never slighted against for being Jewish. He didn't even practice Judaism, so his Jewish heritage has even less impact on him. Until he's asked to help infiltrate the KKK. The flip in his position from regarding it as just another part of his job to something more meaningful is a reminder that race issues are not just segregated to the black community. In the words of Zimmerman; ""...I never thought much about it, now I'm thinking about it all the time..."" That is the kind of impact BlacKkKlansman seeks to achieve in everyone, regardless of ethnicity or background.<br/><br/>While I think Spike Lee's walkout of the Oscars when Green Book was announced as the best picture winner was childish, like a tantrum over not winning what he felt he was due, and as much as I enjoyed Green Book as an entertaining movie, BlacKkKlansman probably deserved the recognition more. Green Book was just a movie, the very thing BlacKkKlansman makes a point not to be. While they both tackle racism, BlacKkKlansman feels more genuine and more impactful. Of course they're completely different movies aiming for completely different audiences, but I feel like I can at least understand Lee's feelings watching his movie, that he didn't see as just a movie but as a social cry for help (the upside down American flag at the end is all the evidence of this you need), lose to a piece of entertainment made by white people for white people. Yeah, that would feel like a stick in the gut.<br/><br/>BlacKkKlansman is a really good movie. A really, really good movie. It definitely deserved more recognition than it got when it first came out. It balances the lighter more comedic moments with the more important and serious tones perfectly, forcing us to really ask ourselves why we found that moment funny, and how the implications are actually terrifying. If nothing else Spike Lee has earned a whole lot more respect as a filmmaker from me. This movie is dense. There's so many different layers to it. It's hilarious and upsetting in equal measure, it has so much to say and tells most of it in a smart and affecting manner, and even on a technical basis the film looks and sounds great, driven by fantastic performances all round. I give it a high 8/10. Would definitely recommend."

For that reason, the entire film made no sense to me at all. However, it is based on a true story, so go figure??"
"liamspillane-18301","7","2","7","1 November 2018"," I understand the controversiality.
","First off, I would like to commend Mr. Spike Lee for his impressive interpretation of Ron Stallworth's autobiography, Black Klansman. I believe BlacKkKlansman was a very well made movie, and it was an effective way to address the very real problem of racism in our country. On the other hand, I was not impressed with the shots Mr. Lee took at President Donald Trump, as they seem to blame Mr. Trump for all of the violent protests that have been going on in our country.
I am going to say here that I personally consider myself Right-of-Center, from a political standpoint. Now, if the idea of even reading what I am writing is just that intolerable to you, you are welcome to stop here. For those of you that are genuinely interested in my opinions, feel free to read on.
As a Caucasian myself, I greatly appreciate how Mr. Lee addressed the issue of racism in both directions, even if that was not his initial intent. I believe that the references to the Black Panthers and the inclusion of Mr. Kwame Ture's rally were an excellent way to recognize that racism could go both ways.
There were many other good, and even great, aspects to this movie, but as this is mostly meant to be a critique, I will just say that the portions of BlacKkKlansman that I do not address are, in my opinion, well produced.
Now, as an American and a proud member of the Republican Party, I did not appreciate the way that this movie made allusions to my President in relationship to the hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. I will admit that there weren't very many of those allusions in the movie, but the few slogans that made an appearance seemed to be very targeted. Just as an example, I will use the background comment of one of the Klan Initiation attendees of ""Make America great again"". As I am sure you all know, this was a very popular slogan throughout Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential Campaign, and I feel that the use of this statement in a KKK setting was not politically appropriate and was intentionally inflammatory. Again, though, I will be the first to admit that there were only a handful of these potentially harmful remarks in the movie.
The other issue I had with BlacKkKlansman was the use of footage of a Trump rally in the ending coda. There is no argument that Mr. Lee or anyone else would be able to make that would convince me that the use of this clip was not meant to slander President Trump and fully blame him for all of the far-Right rioting. I do not condone those protests, and neither does President Trump, as he has said on multiple occasions. From a totally moderate viewpoint, violent protests are being carried out on both extremes of the political spectrum, and none of them should be supported.
So in closing, I believe that the issue or racism that Mr. Lee and Ron Stallworth partially address in BlacKkKlansman is a very valid one and it should not be taken lightly. Thank you."

I felt the ending was a bit underwhelming, although the modern day real life footage was chilling to see."

"jboothmillard","7","2","7","6 September 2018"," BlacKkKlansman
","It had been some time since Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Spike Lee (She's Gotta Have It, Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, Inside Man) brought out a film, or ""joint"" as this one is referred, many fans would have been delighted with this one, a ""stranger than fiction"" fact-based story, the trailer definitely made it look appealing. Basically in 1979, Ron Stallworth (Golden Globe nominated John David Washington, Denzel's son) is as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs, Colorado police department. He is initially assigned to work in the records room, where co-workers give him constant racial slurs, but he demands to be transferred. Stallworth is assigned to go undercover, to infiltrate a local rally, at which national civil rights leader Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins) is to give a speech. There he meets Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of the black student union at Colorado College. After the rally, Stallworth is reassigned to the intelligence division, while reading the paper, he finds an advertisement to join the Ku Klux Klan. Stallworth calls and pretends to be a white man, he speaks with Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold), the president of the Colorado Springs chapter, claiming his hatred for black people and other minorities. Stallworth recruits his Jewish colleague, Flip Zimmerman (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Adam Driver), to act as him in order to meet the Ku Klux Klan members in person. Zimmerman attends a meeting and meets Walter, along with the more radicalized member Felix Kendrickson (Jasper Pääkkönen), he also hears another member named Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser), who cryptically refers to an upcoming attack. Zimmerman and Stallworth continue to cultivate their relationship with the local Klan chapter. Stallworth calls Klan headquarters in Louisiana to expedite his membership, he is shocked to be speaking to David Duke (Topher Grace), the Grand Wizard, they soon engage in regular conversations on the phone. Kendrickson, who is very suspicious, almost makes Zimmerman take a ""Jewish lie detector test"" at gunpoint, but Stallworth causes a distraction, throwing a rock through the Kendrickson house window. Stallworth begins dating Patrice but does not tell her that he is a police officer, and he learns after meeting an FBI agent that two Klan members are military personnel stationed at NORAD headquarters. Duke visits Colorado Springs for Stallworth's induction into the Klan, while the real Stallworth is assigned to protect Duke during his visit. After Zimmerman, masquerading as Stallworth, is initiated, Felix's wife Connie (Ashlie Atkinson) leaves the ceremony to place a bomb at a civil rights rally. Stallworth realises her intentions and alerts the authorities, acting on Felix's backup plan, Connie tries to plant the bomb in Patrice's mailbox, but instead leaves it under her car. Stallworth tackles her when she tries to escape, but uniformed officers detain and beat him as he protests he is working undercover. Bomb maker Walker recognised Zimmerman from a prior arrest and conviction; he, Felix and Ivanhoe arrive and park next to Patrice's car, they set off the bomb, not realising where it was hidden, and are killed in the explosion. Zimmerman arrives and frees Stallworth, and Connie is arrested. Stallworth celebrates the case being closed and tricks a drunken Landers into bragging about his assault on Patrice, whilst wearing a hidden microphone, leading to Landers being arrested. Police Chief Bridges (Robert John Burke) congratulates the team for their successful operation but orders them to end it and keep all details from the public. As he is packing up, Stallworth receives one last call from Duke, Stallworth reveals to him that he is a black man before hanging up on him. Later, Patrice (who found out he was a police officer) and Stallworth discuss their future together, they are interrupted by a knock at the door, in the distant they see a large flaming cross on a distant hillside surrounded by Ku Klux Klan members. The film ends with footage from the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, including footage of the white supremacists, the real David Duke giving a speech, and President Trump's statements after the events. It also shows the memorial to Heather Heyer, the car attack victim, and an upside-down American flag, which fades to black and white. Also starring Alec Baldwin as Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard, singer Harry Belafonte as Jerome Turner, Isiah Whitlock Jr. and Mr. Turrentine and Michael Buscemi (Steve's brother) as Jimmy Creek. Washington in his major film role rises to the challenge as the determined black cop who infiltrated the KKK, Driver as always is reliable playing his colleague, and Grace does well as the calm but quietly nasty head of the cult, Eggold and Pääkkönen are also scary. The Ku Klux Klan have been one of the most reviled and dangerous cults over the centuries, so it was most interesting to see Lee bringing to life a fascinating story of a black man brave enough to tackle them head on and stopping any planned attacks, there are many chilling scenes of tension, and a wonderful sense of absurdity throughout, many are relevant and mainstream to events today, it does take things seriously, but manages to squeeze in well-timed moments of humour as well, a most interesting biographical comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for Spike Lee, David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Willmott, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Score for Terence Blanchard and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film and Best Original Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"

Unhappy with his initial assignment but still determined to do his job, he's transferred to the intelligence division where he tries to pull off the daring task of infiltrating a local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. Despite how far-fetched it may seem, this is actually inspired by true events (though some obvious artistic liberties are taken) and naturally Lee uses this as a platform to inject some of his own political propaganda, but it's a fascinating story with fine performances, invigorating dialogue, and much more humor than you'd expect from a film with this type of subject matter. A solid all-around showing, with effective performances from Washington--yes, he's the son of Denzel--and Adam Driver. ***"

","Spike Lee is a top notch story teller and an obvious talent, but sometimes he lets his politics (and his latent hatred...and maybe even his racism) crowd out his talent.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie and it was a must see after watching Lee's behavior at the Oscars; I just had to see what all the fuss was about. So while I would certainly recommend anyone to see Blackkklansman I wouldn't make the argument that it deserved best picture.<br/><br/>The acting was very good, the screenplay excellent, etc. But the film, like a lot of others, was needlessly long and could've done without some scenes. I got the impression that Lee wanted to make sure he made his political points while telling a story. For instance, he wanted the villains to look as stupid and backwards as possible. We get it, racists are stupid and backwards, but the audience doesn't have to be hit over the head with it.<br/><br/>If I could speak with Lee I'd tell him to make more movies...and maybe take some anger management classes as well."

"movieman6-413-929510","7","1","3","5 February 2019"," Spike Lee shows the problems of racism on a realistic and with some comical moments with BlacKkKlansman.
","BlacKkKlansman is a biographical crime drama directed by Spike Lee, the director of Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X. The film is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, the first African-American agent who managed to infiltrate Ku Klux Klan.
In the film, Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is one of the first African Americans to work with the police in Colorado Springs. Here he is treated as a lesser person by his colleagues because of his skin color, but Ron does not try to attract too much of it here.
In order to get a better job, Ron manages to make contact with the Ku Klux Klan by telephone and knows how to draw their interest with insults about the dark people. When Ron is invited to come by during a Klan meeting, he asks his partner Flip Zimmerman to play his role as a person.
So they infiltrate in the Klan with Flip as Ron's personal character, while Ron himself continues to work as a telephone contact with the Klan. For example, they must continue to play Ron Stallworth until they reach the Klan high enough to access most secret plans and then stop them as agents. In order to succeed in this, Ron and Flip have to keep their actions for many secrets. Flip is known as an agent and should try not to stand out too much and Ron can not easily warn befriended African Americans how to get information about the dangerous plans of the Klan.
This film plays well and informally on the problems of racism of the past and present. The film responds so realistically to how people who were formerly no white Christians were seen and treated as inferior. Despite the fact that this is no longer done so extremely, unfortunately it still happens too much that people treat their skin color or belief as negatives or are treated by, for example, extreme right-wing politics or people who have less and still remain to blame. to give. That is why this film is important to watch in order to learn and see more about this subject. For example, the end of this film contains real images of true racist situations of the past and present.
Spike Lee tells the story in this film a bit in a dark comical way to keep the film nice despite the dark theme. For example, some scenes have a laugh in the film, but in most scenes the film remains serious and exciting where the two agents try to keep their work secret. Spike Lee also added some slight adjustments to the film to make it more like a film.<br/><br/>The acting is also done well and realistic in the film. John David Washington has not had many major roles in his acting career, but still puts down good work as the main role of this film. He also delivers good acting that clearly shows how difficult his character is in certain scenes in this film. You can sometimes tell from his voice that he is the zoom of Denzel Washington, but despite that he gets out of the shadow of his father with this film.
Adam Driver also performs good acting and comes out especially well in the exciting scenes where he is an undercover agent between members of the Klu Klux Klan. Topher Grace David Duke plays the leader of the Klan in this film. It is special to see an actor best known from the comedy show That '70s Show now as the racist leader of the Klu Klux Klan. Like other actors who play members of the Klan, he has also admitted how difficult it is to play such a dark role, and Topher Grace also said that he felt very depressed after playing this role."
"tomgillespie2002","7","1","3","11 December 2018"," It isn't Lee's best work, but arguably his most ambitious
","Although he is still producing an impressive body of work, it feels like Spike Lee has been away from the mainstream for an age. When Jordan Peele brought him the unbelievably true story of Ron Stallworth, a black detective who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s, Lee jumped at the chance to tackle what would be his biggest joint since 2013's rather pointless Oldboy remake. If the movie didn't tell you as much at the introduction, you would likely have a difficult time believing that what you are seeing actually (well, kinda) happened. Based on Stallworth's memoir Black Klansman, Lee takes the story and successfully manipulates it into a commentary on racial hostility in the U.S. and its circular momentum throughout the country's history. Not only that, but BlacKkKlansman is also a funny police procedural that tips its outlandish hat to the blaxsploitation movies of the era.<br/><br/>Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) has just become the first black police officer in the Colorado Springs police department. He is eager to make a mark, but finds himself assigned to the records room, locating files for his racist co-workers. After making his desire to work undercover known to his superiors, Ron is tasked with infiltrating a rally involving civil rights leader Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins), where he meets Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of a black student union. Assigned to the intelligence division, Ron spots an advert in the paper for a KKK recruitment drive and, with his best white man voice, bags himself a meeting with Walter (Ryan Eggold), the president of the local chapter. His fellow officers are quick to point that not only did Ron give Walter his real name, he also happens to be black. Enter Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), the Jewish co-worker who takes the job of working his way into the ranks of the ever-suspicious Klan, while Ron does his part on the phone to try and land a conversation with Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace).<br/><br/>BlacKkKlansman is certainly not without its flaws. Lee's desire to envelop Ron and Patrice's blossoming romance into the KKK's plan to carry out a terrorist attack leads to some glaring pacing issues, and an eagerness to hold up a mirror to the growing far-right attitudes of the Trump era can often be heavy-handed. Yet Lee's interesting style - mixing comedy with serious issues and often within the same scene - pulls you along for the ride, with the director showcasing a rarely-seen talent for suspense. Flip's assignment is fraught with problems, from the volatile and suspicious Klansman Felix (Jasper Paakkonen), to the fact that Ron's voice sounds oddly different on the phone to real life. Some of the supporting characters are perhaps a bit too cartoonish for the film's overall tone, the script from Lee, Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz and Kevin Willmott, is incredibly sharp and witty without taking anything away from the seriousness of the underlying themes at play. Lee goes straight for the jugular, ending with shocking footage of the car attack at the 2017 Unite the Right rally to remind us of how little has changed, and how the threat never really went away. It isn't Lee's best work, but its one of his most vibrant and cinematic joints, and arguably his most ambitious."
"kylerafa","8","1","3","22 November 2018"," Could've, should've, would've been a Masterpiece
","This film tells in a very good and audacious ways what must be told those days. Emotions are there, suspens is there. It's sad, funny, raw, intriguing at the same Time. Actings are good. But ... The screenplay is flat when it comes out of comedy, actings and tragedic dramatic scenes are overplayed sometimes, scenes and dialogues could've been done better. It tries a lot to be perfect but there was a big problem when shaping the film Itself. Honestly it could've been better, far better. It would've been a CLASSIC MASTERPIECE !"
"Joe X.","7","1","3","9 September 2018"," Entertaining, slightly odd pastiche of comedy, drama, politics, history
","Spike Lee has some great source material here (how was this story not more famous?) and he doesn't screw it up. <br/><br/>The comedy isn't laugh-out-loud funny and some more suspense could have been wrung from the plot. Because the book really didn't contain one, a big ending had to be written in, and it's a bit of a let down. Still, Lee is able to knit an absorbing story out of all the parts.<br/><br/>The incredible thing is most of the rest of it is true, and the two leads Washington and Driver do a good job bringing it off. Topher Grace is well-cast as David Duke, but the rest of the support is a little thin in spite of the film's expansive run time.<br/><br/>Lee must have loved learning about the Klansmen's ""Birth of a Nation"" movie night. It allowed him to delve into one of his favorite topics, the whitewashing of D.W. Griffith. It might seem a little didactic to those who already know the story, but it's a good history lesson for younger viewers.<br/><br/>Lee bookends the film with political commentary in his typically provocative fashion, which was jarring but affecting. Alas, he's likely preaching to the choir given his audience.<br/><br/>BlackkKlansman certainly gave you something to think about on the way home, like the best of Lee's films did, and for that it's worthwhile viewing."

"generationofswine","1","2","11","14 February 2020"," An Honest Review
","I think the last film of Lee's watched and enjoyed was his Malcolm X biopic... but to be honest I don't think I really enjoyed the film so much as I did Denzel's performance. I mean, isn't it nice to see Denzel Washington playing something other than the smart law enforcement officer and actually bring his all to a film?<br/><br/>I guess I should be fair and say that it's not as horribly bad as Son of Sam was... but it's bad in a way that Nicholas Cage is had to watch in all of his movies... almost all of his movies. He actually has a few good ones.<br/><br/>I guess Lee's approach to this was to tell all of his actors to over-act as much as humanely possible for even the smallest roles. There is not a line that isn't over done, not a part that isn't over-acted. There is nothing naturalistic about this and it makes it so very hard to watch.<br/><br/>The result is a serious subject that could have been a compelling biopic, that was turned into a cartoonish mess."

","Spike Lee is a very talented and accomplished movie maker. His best work counts among the finest in American Cinema (""Malcolm X"" is a great example). However, as regards ""Black Klansman""..I fully agree with many of the reviewers that the story was compelling and that generally speaking the racism of the era was well displayed via this microsm of society. However, I think that if Mr. Lee had stayed with the story rather than proselytizing about modern day politics the movie would have been much, much better. Mr. Lee hits seems to have felt the need to sledgehammer his point home ...a very valid one...rather than to let the historical events speak for themselves. An example...Harry Belefonte's telling of that story in the movie was far, far more heart wrenching and effective in making the point of the story than that final scene montage that was gratuitously provided at the end of the flick. All that said, having lived through the time in question Lee was spot on as regards the production design all around and those ""naturals"" that the Black characters sported were, as was said then, ""Oughta sight!"""

The film is really enjoyable, I didn't stop watching it neither for a second.
Firstly I didn't understand how could the end be in any way related to the film, but after a few scenes I realised how it was all connected. The end is ""disturbing"", during the whole movie there are strong images. The propaganda movie shown, the last videos... everything has a reason and is connected. The whole movie has a strong message on how racism affected and still affect us today. How it was imposible to continue investigating against the clan.
I'm glad the movie reacived prices, because it deserved them and I hope people could watch it the way I did. It's an impressive work.

","Whilst gripped by this movie at the start especially where Ron Stallworth goes undercover I genuinely felt for the struggle that the black people were facing at that time and indeed now. Midway through the movie I did find myself trying to stay engaged but nodding off, characters were shoehorned in and not really explained or fleshed and the insertion of blaxploitation movie references were not really required. All in all I think BlackkKlansman is more of a statement on Trumps America today instead of trying to tell a fascinating but true story. The move also was supposed to have an edge of humour to it, but sadly it was lost on me for such a serious subject matter, Spike Lee's Jungle Fever hits the mark better"

","Spike Lee connects his art to the racism in America. Blackkklansman makes no mystery that it is equal parts thesis and entertainment.

","This is Spike Lee's most Tarantino-esque project to date - like Tarantino, he lovingly absorbs 70's Blaxploitation to great effect and ends up surpassing the genre he's sending up. That's what makes it work so ingeniously - it's a message movie wrapped in the guise of a pulpy platform (the premise is inspired by a true story, but the delivery is pure pulp) and it works for the same reasons those 70's Blaxploitations worked - a style, an attitude (not to mention an outstanding soundtrack) that makes it immediately accessible to virtually all audiences. In a year filled with black message movies, many of which blur shamelessly together and range from bad to middle-of-the-road, this is a prime cut that decades of experience, the shocking revelation that Spike still had at least one more great movie left in him, have boiled up to. Even Do The Right Thing, while immediately likeable, took two viewings to recognize the greatness of it, while this was immediately palpable, vibrating with an instantly infectious sense of urgency.

"rarajackson","7","1","6","2 May 2019"," Spike Lee's more ambitious films
","I personally consider BlacKkKlansman to be one of Spike Lee's more ambitious films. Throughout the film he incorporates so many historical, yet topical nuances that force the viewer to see the uncanny parallelism of the trials and tribulations African Americans have undergone, ranging from all the way back in 1939's Gone with the Wind to the 2017's Unite the Right Rally. However, some of the films' strongest moments don't happen to be plot twists or cliffhangers. Instead, they are the beautifully, interwoven layers that speak the loudest volumes without explicitly saying their truer intentions. For example, Lee chose to overlap the jarring story of Jesse Washington told by Jerome Turner to the Colorado Black Student Union for their ""All Power to all da People"" campaign with the inauguration of the false, white Ron Stallworth into the Ku Klux Klan. By switching back and forth between the Klansmen's celebrated screening of 1915's Birth of a Nation and the Black Student Union's tiering prints of adolescent lynching, we get an impactful almost side by side visual comparison of two paradoxical environments that inherently highlights the abhorrent beliefs and values of the Klansmen.
However, Lee's dryly-comic approach to such a sensitive piece evokes frustration and disappointment from his peers and rightfully so. Although an interesting perspective on this may be that the individuals who found portions of the film to be comical weren't ridiculing a shameful part of America's past, but rather found the actions and values of the Klansmen so shockingly preposterous that their default response was humor. Overall, I feel this film exemplifies a strong African-American film by the way it encompasses critical pieces of the civil rights movement's past so as to not only be reminded of their significance, but also prevail their relevancy to today's culture."

You can expand your historical knowledge and increase your vocabulary by watching this film. Spike managed to make the hero of the movie who would be a otherwise unlikable character very endearing seem oh so charming and come off as misunderstood and taken for granted!
You left the film with a sense of respect for the black cop Ron Stallworth played by John David Washington when you saw everything he had to go through and how he still was willing to when a lot of others wouldn't have and finally put his foot down when he had to and knew how to step back and follow instructions as well!<br/><br/>It takes a level of humility to be the leading man and still be very much behind the scenes too, my only criticism is for one John David Washington is way too dark skinned to blend into the role
aesthetically! They could of at the very least put make up on him to make him look a lot lighter oh and another thing it is already hard enough to accept that a black guy infiltrated the klan as it is, so why oh why make up a Jewish character ironically who is the furthest thing from Jewish, who plays a critical role in the movie?! Oh that is a rhetorical question , I get it I know that it is stimulating left wing propaganda however that element shouldn't have been added too much politicizing can bring things out of focus and I say this as a conservative liberal.<br/><br/>This is Spikes best movie, he deserved to win a oscar for it, I enjoyed watching it With all that said I still cannot say it is the type of film that I can watch over and over again."

"anselmdaniel","7","1","7","13 October 2018"," A dramatized and fun account
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Blackkklansman is a biographical movie directed by Spike Lee. The movie stars John David Washington and Adam Driver as police defectives in Colorado Springs. The two investigate the Ku Klux Klan chapter in Colorado Springs. Eventually the detectives discover a dangerous plan they must thwart.<br/><br/>The movie relies heavily on John David Washington as Ron Stallworth and Adam Driver as Flip Zimmerman. This is a good thing as these two leads compose a great center of the movie. I enjoyed any scene that these two actors were in. I enjoyed that both of these characters had to play Ron Stallworth for the Ku Klux Klan chapter. Adam Driver is becoming a master class actor as he is able to play many roles.<br/><br/>The story of Blackkklansman is engrossing. Watching the police infiltration of the Ku Klux Klan and Ron Stallworth ascending the ranks is exciting. Even the police dynamic with the real Ron Stallworth and the Colorado Springs police department is fun to watch. The movie's plot and pacing is not without problems.<br/><br/>The opening and closing scenes of the movie are out of place. The movie opened with Alec Baldwin playing Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard giving a bigoted speech about African Americans. The movie ends with Ron and Patrice seeing a burning cross on a distant hillside. I felt that these scenes are not necessary. The opening scene did not add anything to the movie except to set the tone that the rest of the movie already sets. This is also the same with the closing scene as the end cuts to scenes of the Charlottesville's Unite the Right rally. I feel that the movie would have been more powerful if it had ended on the burning cross. The audience could have made the connection on their own. As it stands the opening and closing scenes are too blunt and offer nothing to the movie's plot.<br/><br/>I would recommend Blackkklansman.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

The ending was very unexpected as well. You see at the end that the main character gets back at the KKK leader in the best way, and for a second you believe it will end on a happy note (as much as a movie like this can be happy), and then you see the footage of the Neo Nazis and white supremacists of today, and it is heartbreaking to see how little we have learned. It hits you hard knowing that the riots where people are being beaten and even killed are actual footage.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a must watch.

"senor_spielbergo123","Null","0","1","5 December 2019"," Nothing wrong with the message, a lot wrong with the movie
","Racism is wrong, it was wrong in the 70ies and still is wrong today. Sadly, the movie doesn't handle this matter in a masterful way. And the Academy was apparently willing to look over its issues and wasted potential.<br/><br/>First of all, it is a blaxploitation movie at heart and only its premise of a black cop infiltrating the KKK is factual. The rest is heavily fictionalized for its claim to be ""based on true events"". This could be justified if it would have elevated the material but I don't think that is the case.<br/><br/>Driver's acting was - as usual - very natural and likeable but he was not given space to shine to actually justify his Support Oscar nomination. There is one scene where he questions his own identity and the meaning of his Jewish heritage after he spent a long time as an undercover cop surrounded by antisemite Klan members. However, it is not quite tied in with the racism aspect and never concluded either.<br/><br/>Laura Harrier as black student leader Patrice Dumas was very one note and she was essentially reduced to love interest and assassination target.<br/><br/>A highlight were the phone conversations between John David Washington as black Detective Ron Stallworth and Topher Grace as David Duke, who surprisingly was portrayed very mannered. In contrast, most of the other characters felt like comical stereotypes. I assume it should create comedy how dumb KKK people are. Also, what was the point of them finding out that something's going on if it doesn't really create tension? In fact, pacing of the whole movie didn't create a lot of suspense.<br/><br/>The editing is slightly disjointed but okay, the soundtrack main theme is pretty good but repeats itself too often.<br/><br/>Then there is the issue that the movie could easily have ended 15 minutes earlier. The ending fails to naturally wrap up the story and instead they tacked on news footage of the 2017 Virginia events. The movie leaves you with a gut punch, which is fine, but there must have been a classier way to link that era to our times. Spike Lee assumed the audiences are a bunch of 5 year olds who need to be hit over the head with the political message."

","BlacKkKlansman for the most part was good. I was impressed with the way Spike Lee handled the film considering his last few ventures didn't work out. This was a film I could tell he really cared about.<br/><br/>The overall presentation of the movie was great. It was well shot and had some great cinematography. The soundtrack, in particular, got me into the mood of the film. The main theme, to this day, is very catchy and still playing in my head on loop.<br/><br/>This was the first time I witnessed John David Washington act and I felt he did full justice to his role and played it off really well. Adam Driver was also fantastic and hilarious in many parts of the film. His chemistry with Washington felt believable. Topher Grace was great as well. The acting overall was solid.<br/><br/>I liked Lee's approach to the film. Whilst trying to spread awareness of themes like racism, Lee mixes the seriousness of this issue with some lighthearted humour which kept me invested with these characters. Whilst I did feel the story was predictable and knew what direction the film was taking towards the 3rd act, I didn't lose interest due to the subject matter and interactions between each character. I also thought the film was a bit too long. If around 15-20 minutes were trimmed off the runtime, then it would have been more smoother.<br/><br/>All in all, BlacKkKlansman was a decent film. It may have not surprised me but it was a fun experience which you can take a lot away from. I'm happy Spike Lee is back into his territory and hope he continues to make good films more like this."

My writing of this BlacKkKlansman review feels like that.<br/><br/>I did really like this film, I am honestly surprised there are not more films like this being made in the heat of today's racially charged climate. Yet, while watching this film, which shows glimpses of powerful imagery, camaraderie, and evil, I found myself a bit detached from the emotional weight of this movie. In fact, I will say other than that real-life footage at the end of the film BlacKkKlansman felt like a bit of a let down at parts. To be fair, this issue is probably on me. I was expecting a film that was going to give me that sick stomach feeling that I got watching that end of movie real footage. Yet, I didn't. I did not want to see race violence to the extreme but I had expected it with the subject matter of this movie. There are scenes that are generally frightening, though they are mixed in with a lot of light-hearted moments, and sometimes they just took me out of the experience.<br/><br/>Ugh, reading this back makes me feel like I am advocating for more violence, which I am not. I just felt like the emotional impact of this was lost a bit in the light-hearted moments. Also, Ron's white guy voice sounds like Eddie Giffin's white guy voice in Undercover Brother, which didn't help.<br/><br/>Other than the mixed emotions of the tone, I have nothing to complain about.

","This is a good movie. It is important to throw a spotlight on our cultural flaws and ingrained pre-judgements of each other. Otherwise. how will we overcome them? It is a good story, incredible in its root in reality. The cast and their performances were good (with the exception of Topher Grace who was horribly miscast). It had some unexpected treasures, like Harry Belafonte as Jerome Turner who mesmerized us with his testimony of brutality. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. Does its subject matter alone elevate it to Best Picture (it is nominated in 5 other categories for Oscars, as well)? I'm not sure. MINI RANT - In an age when popular understanding of history is based on the movies people see, I think it is important to point out that if a movie says it is based on actual events, as when a movie says it is based on a book, there is a lot of artistic license taken to shift details around and changes made to make it a good movie, even to the extent that the film is more fiction than fact. I'll give you just three examples from this film, it is based on the 2014 memoir BLACK KLANSMAN by Ron Stallman. The writers moved the story back seven years (1979 to 1972) to facilitate a reference to a number of blaxploitation films. David Duke didn't find out that Stallworth was black until 2006 (27 years later) when called upon by a reporter to comment on these events. The detective who is characterized as Flip Zimmerman was not Jewish, that is a total contrivance of the film. Two other Oscar nominated films, also saying they were based on actual events, THE FAVORITE and MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, are really fiction far from fact. Beware fiction masquerading as fact! END MINI RANT. Fun Fact: Stallman still carries his KKK membership in his wallet. {Crime Drama}"

His original script is good, well tied up and with well defined acts, although forced at certain times, his technique and photography intertwine between comedy and drama which gives a charismatic air to the work, despite a clear, partial and heavy message.

You either make fun of Klan or turn it into a serious crime movie. The ending about 2017 is really serious and disturbing for me but the movie wasn't so much which is awkward since I think of racism as a stupidity of mankind. I didn't read the book and the comments are that for Ron it was easy to infiltrate to the Klan but to be the first black policeman in Colorado Springs sure wasn't as easy as presented here.

","Ron Stallworth (John David) is hired as the first police officer to the Colorado Springs police department in 1970 due to affirmative action laws. Being assigned to the records room was not what Ron was hoping for when he applied, so soon he asked for reassignment within the department. Ron was asked to go undercover at the Colorado College, and observe listeners while civil rights leader Kwame Ture give his speech. While present at the even Ron meets the president of the student union Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier) and begins an interesting relationship with her. Ron is then reassigned to the slower paced intelligence department. There Ron notices a phone number in the paper for local recruits to join the Ku Klux Klan, Ron then calls and pretends to be a white male attempting to join, only problem is he uses his government name while speaking with the Klan chapter president Walter Breachway. Now having established a relationship via phone with the KKK, Ron must enlist the help of his white co-worker Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to pose as him during the meet and greets with the Klan for obvious reasons.
This films theme being about racism in a time when racism was ending in government settings but remain firm in neighborhoods and communities. With the help of Flip, Ron can infiltrate the Klan by means of gaining support of the grand wizard David Duke via phone meanwhile Flip has gained his place as Ron Stallworth amongst the local chapter. During the time Ron Stallworth was a Klansman who was able to gain enough intel to prevent the death of Patrice via a house bombing because of her Black Panther ties, Ron was also able to let the Klan know mentally African Americans are just as if not smarter than the KKK. Nonetheless Ron was the Klan's three worst enemies, he was an African American and a police officer and he now a Klan member with the official member card with his name on it to prove it.
Similar to the 1996 film A Time To Kill which was based off a 1989 John Grisham novel, both films show unnecessary racism at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan with the burning of the crosses and just the plain dislike and disregard for the African American people as a whole. Both films showed African American males fighting for equality in different forms with the help of both their white counterparts. Whether it was the lawyer in A Time To Kill fighting a racially profiled case or a co-worker helping to infiltrate the Klan, both films showed and told the truth of those times and how working together racism can be defeated."
