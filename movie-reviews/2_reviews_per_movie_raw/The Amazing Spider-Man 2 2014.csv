","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has technical merits. However, these merits are impossible to enjoy in a film drowned from beginning to end in the sickening narcissism of both its purported hero and supposedly tragic villains.<br/><br/>I give you The Amazing Spider-Man: a hero with no principles and no goals. He sometimes cares about a girl and sometimes wants to know what happened to his parents, but day-to-day he really only cares about doing what he wants to do--which happens to be helping people, it seems, because it gives them ""hope."" And what luck! He gives them this just by being himself. Not by being a better person. Not by sacrificing anything else in his life for the greater good. Just by being strong and smart and doing exactly what he feels like doing because that's how he feels. And look: by being himself, other people want to be like him. What a wonderful message for a self-obsessed age. And watching the box office dollars roll in, it would seem that this is just what everyone wants to hear.<br/><br/>Ah, but lovable doe-eyed Petey gives up Gwen for the greater good, right? No he doesn't. He gives her up because he can't face the guilt of having contributed to her father's death--his guilt, and his unquestioned inability to give up being a famous public figure, lead to his need to break up (And his principled stand on this issue is so strong that he will renege on it whenever he feels randy). We never see Peter torn between helping people and helping himself. We see him torn between two paths to self-gratification: the adulation of public heroism (and public vilification, which is a kind of adulation) and the love of a single woman. What about Aunt May? No, not her--she's just in the way of Spidey laundry.<br/><br/>This is the major problem with the reboot: The overshadowing death isn't Uncle Ben's. It's Captain Stacy's. And Captain Stacy didn't die because Peter was self-absorbed. Captain Stacy died because Peter existed. So the standard for Peter being a good person or bad person has nothing to do with his character--it has only to do with his presence. During an over-the-top car chase in the first act, rather than stop a massive truck from smashing through a set of cars (which Sam Raimi has shown us he could have done, assuming equivalence between a truck and a train), Spidey ducks out of the way only to come back after the carnage. This is a hero who says, ""I'm here for you--until it's inconvenient for me, then you're on your own.""<br/><br/>The long and short of it is that this Spider-Man is in no way heroic. Superheroes are heroic because, while they could decide that they are unconcerned with our struggles, they still feel a moral obligation to help the average Joe. This Spider-Man seems to feel obliged to help only because, as someone superior to everyone else, the world's problems must naturally fall on his shoulders. Not because someone died due to his inaction--because he's exceptional. And helping inferior people is what exceptional people do. Sometimes. When they're not busy dealing with exceptional-person stuff. Like obsessing about parents who unjustly abandoned them while feeling no responsibility whatsoever for the uncle they themselves abandoned.<br/><br/>Add to this a pair of villains who go from being apparently well-meaning if somewhat imbalanced individuals to homicidal maniacs due to a single rejection episode, and you have a two-hour cesspool of poorly justified destructive self-obsession. <br/><br/>Electro could have been a tragic Frankenstein villain. Instead, because a group of random people roots for Spider-Man over him in his first public appearance, he decides everyone should die. Yup--that's his motivation. You don't love me because I'm me? Well, I'll kill you all. Thank you, Columbine.<br/><br/>Harry's the same. After a five-minute meeting in which Spider-Man refuses give him his blood--which he truly believes, based on a single night's research on a single computer file, is the only thing that can save him from a horrible death that won't happen for another 40 years--Harry decides that Spider-Man needs to die right now. And everyone who dies in the process of saving his own old-age skin is perfectly okay. This despite Harry having been Peter's best friend only 48 hours before--though not because they have a long history together, but because they talked for a few hours and remembered how they were friends eight years ago. And it's not like either of them developed any other close relationships over their entire time in high school and college. (Let that be the only mention I will make of this film's preposterous set of causes and effects--and its Attack-of-the-Clones-inspired need to intellectually dictate emotional importance rather than meaningfully display it.)<br/><br/>The original Spider-Man had a single moment of narcissism. Count 'em: one. Only once did Peter Parker step up for glory, himself, and his own objectives, and he immediately paid for it with the death of one of the only three people he loved. This new Peter Parker steps up for himself every day as a part of his playground vision of a hero, and not a single screenwriter or billion-dollar audience member seems to care. This Spider-Man says the world should glorify you for being you, and if that doesn't happen, it's the world that needs to change, not you. And that is what truly terrifies me."
"MartinOnMovies","5","630","1010","25 April 2014"," Too much, too unbalanced and a waste of talent
","I can't say I went in to the theater with high hopes. I did enjoy the first installment of this unnecessary reboot, almost anything seemed like a step up from ""Spiderman 3"", and Garfield felt way more natural than Maguire, and Emma Stone is always welcome. But after seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film. <br/><br/>Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and a blue electric guy.<br/><br/>Oh Jamie Foxx, how did you go from Django to this? Before he goes all CGI-Electro he tries to play the nerdy unseen scientist (with a worse comb-over than Christian Bale's 'Hustle'-look). As Electro it's hard to say how much is his fault, and what can be blamed on the rest, I'd go with the rest. You don't sympathize with him nor do you believe how fast he becomes this super-villain. <br/><br/>Everything that Dane DeHaan did so well in ""Chronicle"" just feels unnatural and (maybe not misplaced, but wrong) here. And his character development is way too rushed and quite unnecessary for this film, it just becomes another sub-plot standing in the way of what really matters. <br/><br/>Sally Field does good work as Aunt May, but leaves no lasting mark. Paul Giamatti's Russian criminal is just in the way and only gives a couple of dreadful and laughable scenes. And then there's the mad German scientist named Kafka and I rest my case. <br/><br/>The action and visuals isn't bad, but still doesn't make up for the low ""trying to be Marvel""-comedy and horrific soundtrack, a soundtrack that almost itself destroys the film throughout the exhausting 142 minutes. And sometimes it feels like the movie is taking us as an audience to be stupid, with pointers to what is going to happen. I would like to say that you might enjoy it if you just try and see it for what it is, but it's hard, but hopefully possible! It had an interesting start, with a glimpse inside the past and Peter's parents, but it's left underdeveloped, as is almost everything else, to make room for all its action and villains.<br/><br/>It's amazing how the difference between two big-budget superhero-movies can be so huge, if you put this against ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", a great and, opposed to this one, original film. <br/><br/>Oh how I wish that Marc Webb could have continued with a ""(500) Days of Summer""-esque movie instead, he could keep the sub-plots starring Garfield, Stone and DeHaan, and it could very well be a great film, and probably not such a waste of talent."
"lincolnpjones","9","66","101","22 May 2014"," Seriously underrated
","I really don't understand the hatred this movie gets. Let me start out by saying that I'm not really a Spiderman fan. My experience of Spidey came from the awesome PS1 Spiderman games, the 1994 Spiderman animated series and the Raimi movies. With that being said, Rise of Electro is one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen. I'd put it up there with Winter Soldier, the First Avenger, Blade and even the Raimi Spider-Man films.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield does a pretty good performance as Spidey, balancing emotion with excellent comedic timing. Emma Stone is wonderful as Gwen Stacy. Jamie Foxx is an excellent and quite sympathetic villain, even if he is pushed to the sidelines a little by Harry Osborn. The movie actually makes you care for all the characters, even Harry Osborn. And I'd be lying if I said Gwen's death didn't knock me on my ass, because of how shockingly gruesome it is for a PG-13 movie and because I would've thought they'd let her live.<br/><br/>I really liked what they did with the source material, updating concepts like The Rhino and Electro without taking out too much. Plus, I genuinely feel that this movie pulls off the 'hero rises from the ashes' storyline much better than Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. But is it a good superhero movie? Hell yeah, it is."
"marcossam2011","9","52","82","13 May 2014"," Great, Lived up to ""The Amazing""
","Strong movie, strong plot, excellent action, Andrew Garfield is an amazing Peter Parker and a more amazing Spider-man with his jokes. Still, the villains' development is too much fast, with no persuasive reasons to take down the Spidey. Furthermore, my favorite scene it's the one Peter fights Green Goblin on the tower, then try to saves Gwen by throwing the web, which in slow motion and forming a hand's shape was completely amazing. Her death was sad, but epic, very well developed and adequate. Also, the Rhino appearance in the end wasn't so amazing, leaving curiosity for the next movie, and this is a fact that I don't like: the understanding that will have a next movie, even we knowing that will have."
"wileyb9571","8","45","71","16 August 2014"," A Enjoyable Film
","SPOILERS!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!! I have Never really critiqued film before but I have seen really nothing but terrible reviews for this movie and I thought that I would do it a Solid and give it a good review. Yes it does have its flaws and a lot of them, you can't just focus on its flaws because if you watch a movie for the flaws, then what is the point of watching that certain movie? Because I could not tell you that answer.<br/><br/>You can do this movie a solid with the Chemistry between Gwen and Peter, which I think is a ton better than Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst's Chemistry, In all honesty I never really cared for the original trilogy, Well the second one is good. Third is atrocious. But anyway.<br/><br/>The acting is halfway decent in this film, Dialogue is terrible at points but I can forgive that. Because of the such fun time I had in the theaters. <br/><br/>Downs of The Film: 1.) Jamie Foxx's characters dialog was complete Ass. 2.) Harry is not the goblin or shouldn't be the goblin but they waste potential with Chris Coopers acting capability with that one scene. 3.) They Kill Gwen. Look I knew that they were gonna kill her because I frequently read the comics and read the particular comic at which I was not disappointed in. But when they put it into film it sucked terribly I wanted to punch the screen. One it happened on a bridge not in the clock tower. PS: if you have seen the trailer it does spoil you by literally showing you that Gwen Is dead! I'm pretty sure that Aunt May didn't fall down the clock tower. 4.) They use Paul for literally 6 to 7 minutes through this film. Which I don't Get, why not just put him in the Sequel or introduce him in the ""Sinister Six"" Film that will be released when the 3rd installment was supposed to come out. 5.) No ending credits scene. With all of marvels films there's either a scene thats after the credits, such as, The Avengers, X-men franchise. There isn't a ending scene on this film or there was originally one at which they cut out. I would have rather gotten nothing than the X-men Days of Future Past Scene (Great Flick) Ups of the Film: 1.) Great popcorn fun. 2.) The Humor Works in my book. 3.) I thought this was the best roll Andrew Garfield has ever taken. its a great movie all and all. 4.) The ending Scene I thought was okay, it had moments, but in terms of a fight scene you really didn't get much as a viewer. 5.) Hans Zimmer's score of the film was magnificent. 6.) It made me leave the theater with a smile on my face and I am ready for the next two sequels."
"verndougall","8","47","76","18 May 2014"," Better than what I thought, but not as wonderful as possible.
","I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, only assuming the commercials had been far to revealing. Anyways...safe to say that assumption wasn't very far off. Anyways, now to speak of this in a more revealing light.<br/><br/>Fascinating visuals, wonderful eye opening colors. It felt almost like a comic book jumping onto the page. The portrayal of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy were amazing. Needless to say there's a connection felt between them. However rocky it forms most of the movie though. this isn't much of a qualm, but it was one of the more enjoyable elements. Now, onto something a little distasteful. The villains as they were developing had me hooked. Drawn into them (At least the ones shown mostly,only spoiler here). One character in this is shown to be around more in the commercials, it was more an illusion. You hope for more and it comes up short. The villains when they fully descended failed to keep what was making them enjoyable before the transition. <br/><br/>Anyways, I hope you find this insightful. Through less of a bias side (Love Spider-man). I'd give this movie around more of a 7, or 6.7, give or take between them. Go see it and see what you think, it's worth the ticket."
"iconic-sr","9","55","91","13 September 2014"," The Amazing Spider Man 2
","Initial Review: The Amazing Spider Man 2 is definitely one of the best movies of the year! I also believe that it is the best Spider Man film to date. Marc Webb masterfully fuses action, romance and comedy into a film that is fun and moving for everyone.<br/><br/>The Positives: I liked the first ""Amazing"" that was released, but there were some problems I had with it. I think this film took these challenges head on. I felt like there wasn't much fighting in the first movie, but this was vastly improved. The romance was top-notch much like the first film, and the special effects went above my expectations. *(Spoiler)* I may be hated for this, but I thought it was a good move to kill off Gwen Stacy this go around for two reasons: it needed to follow the comics and it set a much darker tone for the rest of the franchise (which will be needed for future films like ""Venom Carnage"" and ""The Sinister Six."" Towards the middle of the movie I was really getting the vibe that this was mostly a kid-directed movie, but the death of Gwen brought it back to the tragic feeling of Spider Man that was so popular in the comics (God I'm going to miss her). I really enjoyed the villains which added to the fun of the movie.<br/><br/>The Negatives: Now this film wasn't all roses but it was exceptional. One problem I had was the little screen time provided for the Green Goblin (after transformation) and the Rhino. Critics often referred to the film as having three villains, but it really felt like one with two side battles to tease the next film. The character who dons the rhino suit has all but 12 minutes and the Green Goblin (once again, after transformation has like six minutes of screen time (approximately). However, I do agree with the critics that the back story for Harry Osborn felt awkward, and there was one two many story lines running through this movie.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I gave this movie 9 out of 10, due to the facts that it has so many positive aspects and with minimal negative issues (that are really more of a nuisance than anything else. I highly recommend this film for everyone."
"JohnnyPHreak","7","48","79","28 July 2014"," Spider-Man more on his plate than he can handle in this sequel
","I'm an unabashed die hard fan boy for Spider-Man. There I said it. You can call me a homer for anything Spider-Man. I wasn't a happy camper when I heard they were rebooting the films that I fell in love with. The first two Raimi films for me were great. The sequel still holding up today as one of the best superhero movies of all time. The first Amazing Spider-Man was a bit jarring for me. I walked out of the film not knowing what I thought about it. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man but his Peter Parker didn't click with me. I also had some nit picky things about the film as a whole (Gwen instead of Mary Jane, lackluster villain). But watching the film a few more times I realized that I liked it.<br/><br/>I do research on films that I'm excited for. This film came out weeks earlier in the UK and Europe. And the reviews were mixed which was sinking my high hopes. I didn't like the fact that there were three villains (More on that later). But it seemed like they were choosing the right actors for parts and surrounding the film in talent. After much heart and headache reading people thoughts and reviews for me, I'm okay with saying I liked much of this second Spider-Man film.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is Spider-Man and it seems he's embraced the part much more this time than in the first film. His Spider-Man is having fun being the savior of the city. He's making the quips, the jokes and the all around energy of his Spider-Man feels directly out of the comic book. I am finally sold on his Peter Parker. Director Marc Webb finally lets the smart but dorky Parker shine in a few scenes that are hilarious and engaging.<br/><br/>I'm still not an Emma Stone fan but she is a good counter to Garfield's Parker. They have excellent chemistry. You can tell that these may be Webb's favorite scenes to shoot. When they are on screen this huge summer tent pole film because a small drama about two people with a unique love story. <br/><br/>The villains, there are three of them but not really. Let me explain. Rhino played basically as a cameo by Paul Giamatti is really only on screen to show Spider-Man in action at the beginning and end of the film. His main adversaries are Jamie Foxx's Electro who starts off as a man who is saved by Spider-Man. He then becomes a obsessed fan only to in perfect comic book fashion have a horrible accident that grants him superpowers. Foxx is okay, I wouldn't say he is awful. He has some good moments and contrary to what has been written I think he only has one cringe worthy line.<br/><br/>Dane DeHaan is one of if not my favorite actor working this moment. His method style works so well in many of the films he's in and here it's perfect. His Harry Osborn is less cartoon-y than James Franco's from previous films. He's creepy, spoiled, arrogant but dealt with a lot of adversity. His chemistry with Garfield feels genuine. It doesn't feel forced like it could have been. They are long time friends who have been distant but because of new circumstances are forced back together.<br/><br/>The action is fun, fast and so Spider-Man if that means anything. The way they use his spider sense was very cool. I want to see more of that. The small nods to the comic book are fantastic. There are nods here and there to the upcoming sinister six film which doesn't cloud the film. It's just there in the story that this is apart of a large story in the future. I was trying to count the nods to the comic books. The only issues I had with the film was Peter's search for what happen to his father was kind of just there to fill time. Also the great Sally Field as Aunt May got only a few scenes. She was great on screen but mostly wasted.<br/><br/>Because this film is dividing fans I think I've pinpointed the problem. I'm a fan of the comic books and this film feel like a few issues of the comic books aka a mini-series. There are multiple stories, with multiple villains and a lot going on. I'm okay with the finally product and eager to see the film again. For Garfield's performance, the chemistry with Stone and the action scenes this film is a fun ride for any fan of the neighborhood web shooter."
"A_Different_Drummer","6","99","174","4 May 2014"," OK, let's talk about HOPE..
",".... and, to be fair, this was not my idea but the screenwriter's, since the last few minutes of the film reveal that this was a topic very much on his mind when he penned this script.<br/><br/>OK OK, I get that the transition from comic book (graphic novel) to feature film is not easy, but art never is, really. And it has been done successfully. Look at Superman 2 with Chris Reeves. Look at Spiderman 2 with Toby MaGuire. More recently look at Superman Returns (flawed but still brilliant in parts) and even more recently than that, Captain America 2. <br/><br/>What do all these films have in common? Humanity. Hope. Decency. That difficult blending of superpowers with those same quirks and oddities which make us human. <br/><br/>What they lack -- every film above-named lacks -- is brutality for its own sake, gratuitous violence directed against the star (and, by analogy, the viewing audience) just to make them feel the pain. <br/><br/>Yet, astonishingly, this trend is becoming the ""new normal"" in superhero films and no one seems to care, the fans just keep lapping it up. MAN OF STEEL was an abomination, as if the intent was to see how many office buildings you can bang to bits with Superman's head. Ditto Thor 2, ditto The Wolverine (borders on torture porn, that one); and finally, this ""re-imagining"" of Spidey where everything that can possibly go wrong in his day ... does go wrong. Including saving his gf.<br/><br/>Is this entertainment?<br/><br/>Seriously. C'mon folks, wake up and smell the stupid before all superhero films end up like this."
"hunterhayes49","9","46","76","12 May 2014"," A Reason for Hope
","I was a pretty big fan of Raimi's original series when they were released, and the first two films still hold high among my favorite superhero movies. When the reboot was announced I was naturally skeptical; despite Spider-Man 3 and its flaws, I had confidence that Raimi could right the ship. Deep into production I began seeing trailers and clips from ASM, and it gave me some hope. After seeing the film in its entirety, I became a big fan. The story was similar to most origin takes on Spider-Man, but with some small changes to try and separate itself from the original film trilogy. Admittedly, a few of those decisions might've been less than stellar, but Raimi's version nailed the origin and that was hard to top for the new film. With the tale of how the hero came to be out of the way, the sequel could really decide where this series was going to go. It seems to be an exciting direction.<br/><br/>I was skeptical when the cast was announced and we met our new Spider-Man, which is a feeling I no longer have. Don't get me wrong, I thought Tobey Maguire played a great Peter Parker. For my money, he was a solid Spider-Man as well. But Garfield feels truly at home in the role. It isn't to say one performance is more accurate to the comic Spidey than the other; with as many different takes on the character as we have seen in comic book lore, both performances reflect different qualities in different versions of the character. However, Garfield's Spider-Man feels like the version of the character I grew up with. He's humble and soft-spoken at the right times and confident in others. I thought his performance in this film was one of the more defining performances of any Marvel film character alongside Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark.<br/><br/>Spidey's love interest, Gwen Stacy, is portrayed perfectly in not only this film, but in the first as well. I've been a fan of Emma Stone since she hit with Superbad, and she really gives Gwen some life. Her dynamic with Garfield is surprisingly one of the strongest portions of the film. They have such great chemistry that it's impossible not to feel like you're in the moment with them, and Marc Webb knows it. Dane DeHaan shines as well, giving Harry a unique sense of frustration and abandonment. He's dark and brooding, but also sly and cunning when necessary. Jamie Foxx holds well in the film as well. Admittedly the Electro/Max Dillon character is goofy and strange, but I like his motivation. In a world of so many it's easy to feel neglected, and it's clear he has a lot of problems that motivate his transition from bumbling Max to the powerful Electro. <br/><br/>As far as the plot is concerned, there is a lot going on. However, I felt this film did a markedly improved job on balancing the numerous subplots. I never felt as if the characters were fighting for screen time or that any of the plot points were necessarily rushed. Between Peter's parents and his love life and the growing problems arising from Oscorp, it would seem like there's too much happening. But Webb never lets the story lines stray too far before reeling them back in; each plot point directly connects to the finale and ultimate message of the film: Hope. Peter often tells others Spider-Man gives those around him hope, but the ultimate test of the film is how well Peter Parker can maintain that hope himself. Indeed being a hero has a cost, which results in one of the most powerful comic book moments in history coming to fruition on the big screen. Gwen's death is the turning point for our titular character, and one that will certainly drive his actions in future installments. <br/><br/>Ultimately, ASM2 is an ambitious film that does attempt to do a lot in just one film. However, Marc Webb keeps the story moving with enough confidence to tie the plot points together in one swift finale that will change Spider-Man forever. Amazing Spider-Man 2 ****1/2"
"jessie-lou-68-444647","10","46","77","31 July 2014"," Loved It!
","I know there have been so many bad reviews of this movie, but I found it to be a wonderful movie. The thing I love the most about this Spider-Man series is that it isn't afraid to deal with the emotional aspects of the Spider-Man series. Anyway, I will rate each aspect of the movie below.<br/><br/>1) Andrew Garfield: I find Mr. Garfield to be a wonderful Spider-Man. He grasps the cockiness and nerdiness that matches the comics well. He was great in this movie, carrying the emotional and action scenes like a pro. <br/><br/>2) Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy: I absolutely love Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey. Their chemistry is so real (love that they're together in real life), and the scenes between the two of them are my favorite. They are what make this Spider-Man series so special. <br/><br/>3) Villains: I did feel that although the villains in this movie were played well, that there were too many. Jamie Foxx played a good Electro, and Dane DeHann was a creepy Green Goblin. But, I found some of the fights scenes long. Overall, villains were played well. <br/><br/>4) Soundtrack: The soundtrack was OK. I was disappointed that James Horner didn't return to score this one, but Mr. Zimmer did an OK job. Some of it sounded too dub-steppy and I just found it a little too loud. <br/><br/>5) *major spoiler* Gwen's Death: I knew it was coming, but I still cried my eyes out. I cried for a solid 15 minutes. From how aggravatingly close Peter was to saving her, to his hauntingly realistic reaction to her death, it was heartbreaking. I am still in mourning. <br/><br/>6) Other things I loved about this movie: the costumes, some of the sarcastic Peter Parker humor, the adorable Peter-Gwen pictures hanging in Peter's room, and finally getting an explanation as to why Peter's parents died. <br/><br/>I was sad that it didn't get better reviews, because I loved it. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero, and even though I thought the ending was heartbreaking, I will definitely come see the next Amazing Spider-Man."
"dale7171","9","334","651","11 April 2014"," spidey 2 - surprisingly good.
","Being not a fan of the spiderman movies - for me aimed at at kids and teenagers of which i am not - I found this movie to be a bit of an unexpected treat.<br/><br/>Viewed it last night at a 3d preview in edinburgh and what i worried might be a bum numbing 2 and a half hours actually flew by.<br/><br/>Don't want to give any spoilers or ruin any story but the whole pace of this film is much tighter than previous efforts and the tone can be quite dark at times. There is of course love interest but this added to the story and I actually bought into it and found myself caring for the characters, no mean feat for a cynic like me. Thankfully it didn't come across all teen/twilighty which seems to be the norm these days.<br/><br/>The villains are very good, Dane DeHaan in particular is exceptional (is it me or does he remind you of a young Leo di Caprio?) and gives a fantastically unnerving performance - big things beckon for him no mistake.<br/><br/>If you liked the previous Spiderman movies you'll still love this, If you didn't put any misgivings aside and give it a whirl (as i did). Either way definitely go and see this film, words I never thought I'd utter about a Spiderman movie. You Won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>As I said - no plot details and no spoilers, just an honest opinion of my film experience."
"metinbarissonmez","8","44","75","26 April 2014"," Good but there are minuses
","When I watched the trailer my expectations is much higher but after I watch the movie it didn't satisfy my all expectations. Of course it can't satisfy everybody's all expectations at the same time. <br/><br/>The film is generally very good. In the way of Electro's creation is very good, Green Goblin could be better. Harry did very less research about secret projects it didn't mention there it can heal the body. Also spider venom effect Harry very fast. It start to effect Peter in a day or less but effect Harry like 10 seconds. Also slow motions are perfect and it happened the time it should be. Fight with Electro and special effects were very good. It is good to see what happened to Peter's family. Gwen's death was shocked me. I don't understand how she die. Is her back broken or is she hit the ground before Peter catch her. Anyway Ä±n my opinion she shouldn't be dead in this movie maybe she can die in next movie or in the next movie she can go somewhere else and leave Peter. If it is go like that next movie Aunt May is going to die. Comedy is good somewhere but somewhere it is unnecessary. Rhino's type is little different maybe because I saw it only in Spider-Man cartoon. End credit scene could be about next Spider-Man movie.It was unnecessary to add a scene about X-men. <br/><br/>There are minuses but the pluses is more than that I suggest anyone to see that film and it is far better than first movie."
"themorar95","9","281","549","16 April 2014"," A really, really good film
","I personally thought this was an excellent film. It had a good amount of comedy, truly deep emotions, and brilliant action. A great, cohesive film to lead on from the first one.<br/><br/>The relationship between the two main characters are brilliant, and you can really understand what's going on between them as both actors portray their characters very well.<br/><br/>Also, what I like from these movies are that they are more relative to the Spider-man comic books, compared to the Spider-man Trilogy (and let's be honest, they were terrible.) If you have read the comic books, then you'll understand where I'm coming from when you see this movie.<br/><br/>The only downside/s I feel this movie has is that Jamie Foxx, in my opinion, doesn't really fit his character and I felt that he didn't really have a massive say in the whole film, it was more about the other villain - but what I did like is that having two villains didn't make it feel like there was too much going on; it was very understandable and a pleasurable viewing experience, so the director receives points in my book for his story telling.<br/><br/>This review is really brief as I don't want to sway your opinion on the film before you've watched it, but rather to change your opinion on whether you should watch it, and I believe that you definitely should."

","With much speculation about the success of this film, it surprisingly, yet thankfully, lived up to the billing! With expectation high despite the seemingly mediocre Amazing Spiderman it seemed impractical and implausible to believe this film would be any different. Yet with promises of a better script and storyline, it seemed as if the series was about to live up to its initially thought potential. This was already hyped up more so by the pretext of a more intricate storyline which was implied by the previous film's ending. So it proved. The storyline was better, and the bonus of empathy with villains really did not hurt its compelling case. All in all, a film that delivered what it promised..."
"estebangonzalez10","7","34","58","25 April 2014"," ""Let's go catch a spider.""
","""Let's go catch a spider.""<br/><br/>Marc Webb's first feature film, 500 Days of Summer, was a successful small indie romantic film with a lot of heart. He went from that to the huge production of the Spider-Man franchise which I thought didn't necessarily need a reboot so soon. However the film did work thanks to Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker. His natural charisma and confidence translated really well to the character and his sense of humor makes him the perfect candidate to play Spier-Man. I began my review by mentioning that Webb directed 500 Days of Summer because for me the heart and soul of this film is the love story between Gwen and Peter. I can't think of any other superhero film with such a great love story and believable chemistry than this one. Garfield and Emma Stone are incredible together and I loved their scenes. Webb knows a thing or two about young romance and it is the film's strongest asset. The sequel is entertaining and has some great action scenes, but I could've watched this film for the romance alone. The flaws are actually the villains in this film. They don't crowd the film like the trailers led me to believe, but they really don't seem to menacing until we reach the final third act. For a film that runs at 140 minutes it went by really quick and that is always a good sign. Spider-Man 2 might not be as good as this year's Captain America, but it does have its solid moments and clever one-liners. At times the CGI took me out of the film as it looked more like a video game, but there were some interesting shots as we got to follow Spider-Man swing across the New York City landscape. The film works better as a romantic comedy than an actual superhero movie but that was fine with me because it was a really good one. It makes most other recent rom-coms look ridiculous and unbelievable.<br/><br/>After a short flashback where we see what happened with Peter's parents, the camera follows Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) swinging across NYC as he tries to stop a Russian mob criminal, Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti), who has stolen something from OsCorp. In the midst of all the action he receives a call from his girlfriend, Gwen (Emma Stone), who is reminding him that he's going to be late for their graduation. Somehow Spider-Man manages to take care of business and arrives in the nick of time to receive his degree as Peter Parker. His Aunt May (Sally Field) is the only family he has left, but she's there for him like she's always been. Peter however has been having visions of Gwen's father reminding him of the promise he made to not date his daughter in order to keep her out of danger. Apparently it has been a conflict they've dealt with over the last few months and Gwen decides it's time for the two to break up. Gwen continues to work at OsCorp which is now managed by Norman's son, Harry (Dane DeHaan), after his passing. Harry seems to suffer from the same degenerative disease of his father and wants to continue researching for a cure in OsCorp. Peter is glad to see his childhood friend back, but when he realizes what he's up to things get complicated. When an employee from OsCorp suffers a freak accident he becomes Electro (Jamie Foxx), a dangerous foe for Spider-Man and the city.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man has some flaws but it still entertains thanks to the great chemistry between Stone and Garfield. They are perfect together. DeHaan is also great as Harry and he does look like a believable threat for Spider-Man. I had a problem with Foxx's clumsy performance as Max but once he becomes Electro he does look menacing. I didn't care too much about the villains or the action set pieces despite the fact that they were well crafted. The inner struggles that Peter Parker faces with his family drama and relationship with Gwen is at the heart of this film. The final act is more than just a gigantic action face-off, there is actually a lot of emotional elements at stake and that is what lifted this movie as it finished on a high note. There was a very emotional scene scene near the end of the film that left the entire theater in silence. The best thing about this sequel is that it was much more emotionally involving than the original and it banks its strength from Andrew Garfield's charismatic and spot on performance as Peter Parker."

","I was a guy who like the first film and i was thinking the same with this one, and this one is far better than the first one. It's actually come out a pretty good movie. Please don't listen the critics otherwise you will miss why Spider-man is Amazing. If you are going into this expecting a Dark Knight or an Avengers or any other movie, this isn't for you. Spider-Man is a fun character and this movie is like a comic book come to life. Certainly I am not saying that this movie is 100% perfect. There are some things about this movie which can be questioned but after watching i can say i really want to believe in superheroes. A great mix of action, humor, love and pure fun. From the story about Peter's father, over to aunt May and the love to Stacy - everything fitted so well together. End is little sad I was heart broken It killed me inside. If you're a fan of any characters in spider man, I suggest you prepare yourself mentally before watching this film, because you really should watch this film."

","Spider-man comics and movies aren't just about the hero, but they are about the daily struggles that Peter Parker must confront and balance. In the 2nd Amazing Spider-Man film, Andrew Garfield is back at his game at being that Spider-man who is cocky, ignorant, and full of humor, but yet I am pleased to say that he still has that brilliance to make you fall into the shoes of Peter Parker and make you feel like you are still keeping things together as the world is falling apart around you.<br/><br/>When watching this film you will experience an emotional roller coaster that will have you hoping for the best to come out! Kudos to Marc Webb for balancing the villains and supplying the audience with just enough background story to understand their history AND for keeping that rich love story between Peter & Gwen."
"tinovalkki","7","25","41","3 June 2014"," Good but not great
","Once again a good example about movie that critics don't like, but I enjoy to watch. Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro. Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200 million dollars) is hard to cross over. On the other hand if movie makes enough profit as theatrical release couple of more millions should not be any infeasible to approve.<br/><br/>http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/"

","Superheroes are heroic because they feel a moral obligation to help the average Joe. Not this Spider-Man. All the characters struggle against the system that has perpetuated falsehoods. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. But it's a two-hour pile of destructive self-obsession."
"pixrox1","8","27","45","12 May 2014"," ""Down came the rain . . . ""
",""" . . . and washed this spider up."" One pretty much expects Bond Girls to die. Every time Agent 007 gets hitched, his bride catches a bullet almost before the wedding bouquet is tossed. But when a movie's heroes are perky high school kids, movie goers expect more longevity than that enjoyed by Bond Gals. It's depressing enough when teens turn out to have their whole lives BEHIND them on Graduation Day in real life. Film escapism demands that trailers or previews must provide at least a kernel of truth-in-advertising. You expect teens to die in CARRIE, because the previews explicitly show that it's a horror flick. (Even Harry Potter's hapless ""Cedric Diggory"" character is a pretty minor plot sacrifice, thus no exception to this rule.) Teens are the number one demographic for movie multiplexes, so responsible exhibitors should refrain from biting the hand that feeds them. High schoolers also are the most easily influenced film fans. Ever since the rash of suicides and suicides-by-cop inspired by the 1950s film REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, Hollywood studios have made an implicit pact with parents NOT to blindside them with another wolf in sheep's clothing like REBEL. However, AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is in clear violation of this understanding. Therefore, it can be rated ""8"" for college kids, but deserves a cautionary 4-out-of-10 for your impressionable high schoolers."
"trooper5783","9","28","47","23 March 2015"," Finally, a great Spidey movie that's not Spider-Man 2!
","As a fan of Marvel, Spider-Man is one of their best in my opinion. The comics are great, the film adaptations, however, I'm not that fond of. Spider-Man was just OK, Spider-Man 2 was flawless, Spider-Man 3 was really bad, and The Amazing Spider-Man was good, but not memorable. I walked in the theater with semi-high expectations, because I read some reviews and was skeptical about it. However, it was actually fantastic, and is definitely going in the best Marvel movies ever made. I was surprised by the performances of Dane DeHaan(Green Goblin), and Andrew Garfield(Spider-Man), both fitting their roles very well.The special effects are spectacular and imaginative, particularly the web-slinging scenes and Electro's skin. I have an issue with Paul Giamatti's performance as Aleskei Systevech/Rhino and the Sony marketing, but TAS2 is still very awesome and underrated. Even my mom enjoyed it, who doesn't like Spider-Man! Surprisingly, there was applause at the end, so the audience must have liked it."

Also there was a lot of set up for the Sinister Six movie. Andrew Garfield is the best as Peter Parker. Sony should not change him.

","Having multiple villains was a good idea. And linking in with the original spider man films due to the special projects area. Such as professor Octopuses arms. <br/><br/>Most of the film focuses on Elector or Sparky according to spider man. Then near the end there is the green goblin(Harry Osborn)then at the end the guy in the rhino robot. Not seeing the end of the fight was a good touch. <br/><br/>I expect that the next film will probably have like a documentary playing on the TV showing spider mans previous saves.

"dfa120374","8","49","88","18 February 2015"," Much Better Than People Would Lead You To Believe
","So much negativity for a film that is far, far superior to the Raimi cheese-fest astounds me that it's a kin to praising Pearl Harbour over Saving Private Ryan in my opinion.<br/><br/>This version, like it's prequel, is so much better than any of the Raimi films in all aspects from action, story, and CGI that it's no contest for me. In saying that though, I think the only part of this version I didn't really like was the way the Green Goblin was portrayed. He actually looked like a cross between Wolverine and a leprechaun and he was more laughable than menacing. Other than that however, this is a much more enjoyable film than any of the others.<br/><br/>The story for the film, while being pretty predictable, is very decent for a super hero movie. I mean, how many super hero movies can have an Award-winning story that is NOT original or predictable? They are all the same in one way or another so for this story to be criticised more over others is a bit laughable. There is more of a ""love story"" with this sequel as well between Stacy and Parker, but unlike the way the annoying relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson was portrayed in the Raimi films, this one is not insufferable. And that's coming from a guy who hates any sort of romance in movies.<br/><br/>The main cast done a stand-up job once again with Garfield and Stone doing well with their continuation of Parker/Spider-man and Gwen Stacy. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan were excellent in their roles as Electro/Max Dillon and Green Goblin/Harry Osborn respectively, especially DeHaan as Harry Osborn who brought a sly, sneaky, and very snake-like menace to the character. I also liked the Stan Lee cameo again in this one....it wasn't as good as his cameo in the 1st film, but it was still a nice touch.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi may have brought us a more up-to-date take on Spider-man but Marc Webb has made the franchise more enjoyable with less cheese. Ignore the hate and judge for yourself....you may just enjoy it as much as I did."

"broncojameson","8","29","49","28 August 2014"," From A Fan
","My first memory is of my dad taking me to a basketball court near our townhouse, and watching me throw around my first Spider-Man action figure, which came with a parachute. I would toss him up countless times and watch him fly down and I was so overjoyed. I still have that toy to this day. That was the day I fell in love with my favorite superhero. Spider-Man was such a huge part of my dad's childhood, and he shared this with me, and it has become a big part of me as the years go by. I watched the nineties cartoon religiously, I read whatever comic book I could find, and I got as many action figures as I could and created my own adventures, and would draw my own comic books too.<br/><br/>When the original Sam Raimi film was announced, that was an exciting time. I would watch the movie trailers over and over again, and once the movie came out (my dad and I were there on opening day), it was like a dream come true. Not too long after that, Spider-Man 2 came out and is still to this day the best time I've ever had at the movies. This was the true realization of the Spidey character in film, and had a villain in Doc Ock that was absolutely unforgettable. Cannot forget to mention the fight on the train, it's one of the best fight scenes in film ever. It seemed like this franchise was going nowhere but up. Then, Spider-Man 3 Personally, I don't think Spider-Man 3 is a bad film, but it's certainly not a good one. It's a solid mix of some great things, and some horrendous things, there's really no in between. The disco dance crap still haunts me to this day. Anyways, after that failure, Sony decided to reboot the franchise. I remember being really upset by this, but was willing to give it a shot because it was Spider-Man. I actually consider The Amazing Spider-Man to be the biggest low-point for the franchise. Why? There was a complete lack of fresh ideas and an abundance of underwhelming ideas. Andrew Garfield was great (better than Maguire), and his chemistry with Emma Stone as Gwen was the best part, but I couldn't get past the ""been there, done that"" feeling. Everything had been done better before. I pretty much forgot about the movie after I saw it, and was actually starting to stop caring. Honestly, my expectations for the sequel were very, very low.<br/><br/>When The Amazing Spider-Man 2 opened to mixed reviews, it seemed like my predictions were coming true; that the movie was a mess. Still, my dad and I went and continued our tradition of seeing every Spider-Man movie on opening day. As I watched it, I wondered what other people had been watching. When the credits rolled, my dad and I sat in silence for a few moments, and then turned to each other, and both agreed that we had just seen a great movie.<br/><br/>I complained that the first Amazing Spider-Man was an abundance of underwhelming ideas, but the very beginning of the sequel is powerful, and absolutely unforgettable. I could already tell that director Marc Webb had become more comfortable and experienced with filming action sequences; his inexperience sometimes painfully showed in the first film. It doesn't let up from there, with an energetic action sequence with Spidey against a really over-the-top (sometimes maybe too much so) Paul Giammatti, and again, much more entertaining than anything in the previous installment. There were complaints about it not being well shot, unfunny, and other stuff that clearly contradicts the truth of the end product. Then, we get more of the wonderful chemistry between Peter and Gwen that absolutely energizes this movie. Universally, this is a praised component to the new movies. Peter and Gwen will make you smile, laugh, cry, and then cry some more. Rarely do we see chemistry so strong on screen, and a love story we believe in so much.<br/><br/>Some people have said they don't care about the Peter-Harry friendship and think it's uninteresting. Huh? If you know these characters and know their history, it's not only well-done and believable, but also nice to see again, despite the always depressing spin that seems to happen to almost all of Peter's relationships. Dane DeHaan makes for a much better Harry Osborn than James Franco. He's more of the awkward and troubled Harry we saw in the comics, and carries the role well, and I can say I was truly terrified by his portrayal of the Green Goblin. When it came to Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon, aka Electro, I really did feel sympathetic towards his character, kind of like how I felt towards Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>Speaking of emotional depth, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is packed with it. It's bookended by two incredibly powerful scenes, the last scene very moving, and has a lot of emotional force in between. It's this emotional depth that makes the movie work and rise above the little blemishes, and what makes it stand out compared to the other films. Gwen's death is unexpected and heartbreaking, and oh so well done. Peter's discovery of the truth about his parents was wonderful. There's so much to be emotionally invested in. The story is not perfect but engaging. Personally, I haven't actually met a person yet that doesn't like this movie. I've only come across people on the internet who have given it condemnation. I just don't see it as a franchise filler; it's so much more. I loved this movie, and can't understand the hate.I could be wrong (and I often am), but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is great. It brought me back to the joys of playing with Spider-Man at the basketball court, and the joys of experiencing Spider-Man at the movies. Thanks to Marc Webb and the team! Sincerely, A Fan"

","As the title says, I thought this was a generally good movie, not Oscar quality, but entertaining. I walked out of this movie satisfied with all aspects of this movie except for one. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie max/electro is portrayed as a sympathetic villain that you're supposed to feel bad for. We see his ideas stolen, his accident covered up, and then after the accident he is held and experimented on. After all this, I felt genuinely bad for the character, and was hoping for a Spider-Man 3-like ending in which the sympathetic villain is given redemption in the end (just to be clear I recognize how terrible and ridiculous Spider-Man 3 was.) <br/><br/>However, in the end of this movie electro is killed without redemption, which, in my opinion made the whole ""sympathetic villain"" aspect of this movie kinda redundant.<br/><br/>All that being said however, I did thoroughly enjoy this movie, and am looking forward to future sequels. 9/10"

I wished they never rebooted and just continued with Maguire under the suit.<br/><br/>But TASM:2 opens up with a universe far more dense than the reboot let on in the first movie. The second attempt gets finally seems to get things right with Spiderman's style and attitude - true to the comic. Another thing worth noting is that his suit is now more believable considering you can see it ripple in the wind as he swings along the city; a vast improvement from the obvious CGI with Tobey Maquire. Garfield also seems to have beefed up this time around (definitely needed to enable him to portray someone capable of throwing a punch!).<br/><br/>The movie runs quite long and they cram a lot into it - this has been criticised by a few but is something I rather enjoyed.

","First off, I'd like to say that I really did not like the first Amazing Spider-Man, so my expectations were really low coming in to part 2. I was pleasantly surprised by it though. This movie has action, comedy and drama in a perfect balance. I was worried that there would be too many bad guys in this movie, but they did it just right. If I had one complaint, it would be that Harry Osborne's transition to the Green Goblin could have been done differently, it felt a bit rushed to me, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. Another highlight for me was the soundtrack and score of the movie. The music when Electro is in Times Square is amazingly well done.<br/><br/>Overall I liked this movie a lot because it really felt like the Spider-Man I knew from the comics. <br/><br/>There was a mid credits scene of the X-Men: Days of Future Past movie, but I really didn't like that scene."
"CinematicInceptions","8","23","38","26 November 2014"," Very enjoyable. Character driven with exciting action and a decent storyline.
","So far this is my favorite movie of the year, but Battle of Five Armies will probably take its place when it comes out in three weeks. I only saw the first of the 2000's Spiderman movies, but I didn't like it very much. While this new series is lacking in a couple of areas, it certainly fixes the problems I had with the older one. We have a very different Peter Parker to follow. While the old one was shy and nerdy, Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker has a strong personality and is a easier to root for. I know that this is illustrated better in the first movie, but it is evident that becoming Spiderman only changes Peter physically. He has the same level of courage and outgoing nature before and after becoming Spiderman. This is especially true in his relationship with Gwen, because he is okay with her knowing that he is Spiderman and it doesn't change her opinion of him. <br/><br/>In this second installment, he is faced with multiple problems in his two lives. He has to worry about the usual crimes of New York, surviving the attacks of Electro, keeping Gwen safe and in his life, discovering the truth about his past, doing what is best for his friend Harry Osbourne, and the simple issue of getting enough sleep. It is clear that he feels truly free and joyous when he is acting as Spiderman. Now, some people might say that the screenwriters gave him a different personality in his two egos, but I would argue against that. We see the same personality traits when he is in both guises. Also, the little jokes he makes while fighting crime might be part of his disguise. I know that some people find this part of the character annoying, but that's just a matter of taste and nobody can deny that he has a distinct personality in this version. <br/><br/>With Peter in all of his endeavors is Gwen Stacy. She joins the ranks of strong female characters and is very helpful in both areas of Peter's life. She isn't afraid of what will happen to her because of their relationship, which is another plus for her character. The only plot point involving her that I disliked was how she and Peter were supposed to not be together. I understand why it happened, but it was kind of unnecessary because they didn't stay apart long enough for it to really be relevant. <br/><br/>Next on the character list is Max Dillon/Electro. He is a very potent villain with a strong motive. At first glance, it would seem that his transition into villainy is forced and implausible, but if you take a step back and look at his situation before becoming Electro, it isn't so implausible. His anger has always been bottled up inside of him because of how he has been neglected. Spiderman gives him hope and purpose, so when he feels that Spiderman has forgotten him and has betrayed him, his anger explodes and he has a way to vent it with his electrical powers. <br/><br/>The final main character is Harry. Dane DeHaan plays him very well and develops his character naturally. He experiences much of the same emotions as Max does, except that his involve his new job of running Oscorp. Also he feels anger towards Peter rather than Spiderman. I didn't really like the scene at the river with the two of them, because I felt like they were trying to act cool in front of each other the whole time (this was the one point where I felt like the acting was lacking). Harry's plight is worthy of sympathy, but it is also clear that he is blinded by his own problems. So, when he gets the means to take revenge on Peter and Oscorp, his actions are not surprising. The two things I wish they had explained better with his character are his relationship with the one Oscorp guy that was his sort of adviser, and what specifically would have happened to him if Peter's blood had not cured him. Also, I still can't figure out if his Osbourne disease was cured at the end. <br/><br/>The only other character worthy of addressing is Aunt May, who is key in helping Peter discover his past. <br/><br/>In terms of execution, I would say this movie did a good job. The effects were very good. The action choreography was spectacular, particularly the slow motion. Here we see that Spiderman has improved his abilities and resourcefulness like in his encounter with the Rhino and the scene in Times Square. The acting was good all around and the characters were well scripted for the most part. The wide variety of sounds in the film score were a great accompaniment to the film. <br/><br/>While I enjoyed the movie very much, there were a few spots where it lacked. The smaller plot points were underdeveloped, such as Harry's situation with Felicia and the other Oscorp workers. Peter's past was made to seem important, but kind of took the back seat in the scheme of things. Lastly, the Ravencroft doctor was given too much of a personality for the size of his role. <br/><br/>I would recommend it to people who are fans of Spiderman, superheroes, or classy characters like Peter and Gwen. If those things don't entice you, it has a good story and very good action sequences. I wouldn't recommend it if you're someone who insists on looking for flaws in a film. If not, it's worth considering for a Christmas gift or an online rental. One last big thing for prospective viewers to look out for is the trailer. About 80% of the lines in the trailer are not in the movie, though some of the ideas they convey are. However, all of the action sequences from the trailer are included. Overall Rating: 8.6/10."

","Great power doesn't just come with great responsibility but also at a great cost. Heroes deal with their painful pasts and yet rise to face the evil that can threaten the present day. It is their ability to overcome those personal battles in times when darkness looms over society, that makes them superheroes. In the follow-up to the reboot of Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, director Marc Webb (!) massively improvises upon the story's technological rendering and the human element of it that delineates the challenges of being a superhero for an ordinary man. Peter Parker's ability to overcome his fears, his childhood loss, his financial instability and relationship's complication is what really makes him the Amazing Spiderman and in its 2nd installment, his portrayal by Andrew Garfield outclasses any prior attempt. At the burden-heavy core of his responsibility web is Emma Stone's charming Gwen Stacy who is perhaps the most lovable superhero girlfriend yet. <br/><br/>As Spiderman busies himself with crime prevention in the city, thus gaining popularity among its citizens, Peter Parker's personal struggles mount. Devoting time for his girlfriend and being there for her big moments is one challenge but visions of her deceased father warning him to keep her out of his harm's way is a decision that is taken by his destiny and not him. Meanwhile, Harry Osborne (Dan DeHaan) returns to his ailing father's death-bed to take over a device containing his life's work and his empire of OsCorp. The same illness however is detected in Harry and his only solution to a cure is blood transfusion from Spiderman. The hero's woes aren't over just yet. In a freak accident in a lab, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is submerged in a tank of genetically modified Eels that mutate him into 'Electro' – a living electric station that has the power to cause a massive blackout and use that energy against Spiderman. Parker soon realizes that all of his challenges have OsCorp in common and it is his father's hidden video feed that clarifies Norman Osborn's true intentions about the biogenetic projects. Spiderman must now face all his demons, take high volts of electricity thrown at him by Electro, combat the wrath of the goblin-glide rider Harry Osborn and keep Gwen away from imminent danger. A hero's strength will become his weakness and he will pay a price to be the savior of the city that he must protect. <br/><br/>The action is frenetic at times and draws parallels with 'Man of Steel' where each sequence isn't elaborately explained but is delivered in its intense form directly. We all know the powers of Spiderman so the director doesn't waste time in how he goes about the action. The swinging scenes are better than ever at engaging the audience, the action is bigger and Spiderman's powers seem enhanced. The special effects truly come into play when portraying the destruction by Electro and yet, they simply aid the story and characters. The plot balances well between being a Superhero's struggle story and an all-out action duel. <br/><br/>Dane DeHaan plays a sinister Harry Osborn with evil emanating from his expressions. Jamie Foxx 's innocent Max Dillon is then transformed into the CGI version that is Electro and Foxx is excellent in his powerful villain's character. As secrets that are buried in the past are revealed, Peter understands his purpose better and overcomes his challenges. Garfield's quirkiness works in his friendship with Harry, his vulnerability works with Aunt May and his ambivalence works with Gwen. In an all round performance, Garfield manages to out-swing The Amazing Spiderman's curse of being the 5th movie about the superhero in 12 years. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is the reason this film stands out beyond all the action and effects. Her charming portrayal of the young, ambitious and intelligent individual is such a far cry from Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane. Peter's fears raise complications between them while Gwen's confidence and charm bring them closer. The scene when they establish 'ground rules' after a break up can just make one fall in love with her as Peter did. Gwen's science degree makes her more of an understanding partner rather than just a romantic one and such chemistry makes them the best couple in a superhero film.<br/><br/>Faced with an enemy far superior in powers, a complicated relationship shrouded in fear and a past remembered for its losses, the friendly neighborhood Spiderman must rise to live up to a role that every superhero embraces. Through the dark days that took over the city and through days he felt alone, what made our hero 'The Amazing Spiderman' was his ability to give hope to people...... and of course, how he can free fall from the tallest building's top and make us spend all that money on its 3D effect. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.234 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"keyos27","8","23","38","13 May 2014"," Spider-Man's amazing prowess is as solid as his webs
","Whether you have watched previous Spider-Man movies or not, there are tons of potential and spectacular elements where you won't be able to see in Marvel counterparts in this film.<br/><br/>What easily makes me say such a bias statement? The director and the team know how to deliver fantastic and thrilling camera angles to showcase flexible, fast-paced, and detailed web techniques that Spider- Man used when going through oodles of hazardous obstacles to protect citizens in New York while naturally executing chores and roles as an ordinary guy. If that does not live up to your expectations, get ready to giggle at some of the jokes along with mischievous antics.<br/><br/>The super-villain, the blue-neon bodied nerd, Electro, is an electrifying and unique character to be seen. Jamie Foxx does his part as an actor and villain for the first time. The one-on-one battle that involves elemental moves and scientific tactics is the highlight of the movie. Although the plot get vaguely wrapped around between Electro and the Oscorp, it is still interesting to watch the character development. <br/><br/>So what takes 2 stars away from me? It would be the complicated bonds between a young couple, Peter and Gwen, who just can't make up their mind by being hesitant, especially in the middle of the movie. I mean, it is normal for any couples to experience erratic emotions, but the whole romance definitely can be succinct to intensify other aspects.<br/><br/>Despite a number of downsides, I would still strongly recommend this to anyone who is itching to watch a different type of feisty film. Because no movies can offer such a sticky, nifty, and vigorous action like ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" Yes, it is as good as the first one, or like others say, it is better."

"bluetanker_07","9","24","40","1 May 2014"," The Amazing Adaptation Yet (Spoilers, a lot)
","Just got home from watching The Amazing Spider- Man 2, it was great, visually stunning, action- packed and just plain epic.<br/><br/>This new Peter Parker is always giving us proof that he deserved to be THE Spider-Man. He has the flexibility, the moves, the wit, and that 'wow' factor - that will make you stand-up and do a standing ovation for that great job he did.<br/><br/>Time for spoilers guys. I'm warning you, I love spoilers.<br/><br/>The plot of the story for the villain is simple, guy that's invisible to people just wanted to be recognized, just asking for a little attention. Then this guy met the Spider-Man became a huge fan, next thing happened when he needed Spidey - he felt that Spidey let him down - there comes hate and vengeance together with the idea of killing Spider-Man. Then of course, he failed. (I felt like I was watching #Lastikman which starred by Bossing. The story for villain is almost the same as that.)<br/><br/>Harry Osborn is also here. As we all know it he wears the suit as Green Goblin, yet it was not mentioned all throughout the movie. (If it was mention, I did not hear it.) Harry here is full of hate, and much cruel too, if you would ask me. I blame him for a death of someone. (Teary.) He was prisoned, yet still control Oscorps and releases villains from Oscorps 'special projects', with the help of that guy. (I'm guessing he will be Dr. Octopus, just a wild guess, though.)<br/><br/>Oh wait, I said someone died? Made you curious, huh? I'll spoil it out for you then.<br/><br/>Gwen died. Gwen Stacy. Fvckin' died.<br/><br/>I know that Gwen is going to die, we all knew that. I did not know that she will fvckin' die on this movie, I was thinking that she'll be killed on the third installment. I was shocked. I'm expecting it, there were signs during the first part of the movie, yet it still surprised me when that scene happened. Damn! Poor Gwen. I will miss her.<br/><br/>The post-Gwen-died scene is so short. I don't know, I was thinking that Peter would somehow die a little as well. 'Cause he loved her, man. That's hard. He said he follow her, anywhere. She's dead now, so figure. Nah! Gwen left a message to Peter during her Graduation Speech. And that's what Peter is following - not death - though Spidey might die on the third Spider-Man movie. Whoa!<br/><br/>Sinister Six. There were lots of signs and clues spilled throughout the movie. During the releasing of 'Rhino' and also during the credits. Question is, will Spider-Man be in for the Sinister Six movie?<br/><br/>Oh, and news flash! There is NO POST-CREDITS SCENE, so don't bother staying longer. There was one though, during the middle of credits. They showed a clip from X-Men: Days of Future Past. I know, right? Completely out of the picture. It was Mystique attacking a military base to free some mutants. And you can see that scenes on the trailers, most of it.<br/><br/>I think that's it. Oh wait, have you seen on that TASM2 trailer where Harry Osborn shows Peter that he's been under surveillance by Oscorp and then Peter asks why. Then Harry says, ""Isn't that the question of the day?"" Have seen that on the trailers? 'Cause I did not see that in the movie, I might have missed it though. Haha Lolz<br/><br/>OK that's really it. 8.5/10<br/><br/>#TheAmazingSpiderMan2 #PeterParker #SpoilersVsReview #GMallCinemas"

Little cheesy at times but I didn't got bothered. Nice directing and cgi, actors weren't bad at all, all it was that little thing that I would like to call something like ""do not push every stuff in one movie"". Anyway it somehow worked well. First I rated this 6/10 after seeing some low-level version, it probably had missing parts and all. When I now watched c001 bluray-version it was totally different.<br/><br/>Even if you don't bare these mainstream films much like I don't, it was excellent movie.<br/><br/>Ending was little weird and all but so they are all :) 8/10 Terrific job!"

Give me the two other evil enemies at the end, Dane DeHaan really fits his part both as Harry Osborne, but also as the Goblin it is really good. The Rhino that we briefly see in the end is really fitting in my universe of spiderman and the evil fiends he has to battle, so for my sake those are the one they should go for.<br/><br/>Really good and action packed, maybe a bit to long, but it keeps you entertained all the way."
"ankitsin","8","26","44","18 August 2014"," Great Blend of Comedy,Action and Roamance
","This movie is amazing! Acting is very fabulous and character were well portrayed by all the actors. And I must say that the ending is awesome. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an enjoyable film for Spiderman's fan, or just someone who wants to see a fun and action movie. You will laugh, you will get emotional, it has it all and at the right moment. The romance exceeds the action in the movie and it is a great blend of action and romance with comedy. The movie tells the story of Spiderman(Andrew Garfield) and Max(Jamie Foxx). Max is a person with friends and nobody cares about him. He works at Oscorp(which is an electricity generating company) as electrical engineer, which is also where Peter Parker's (Spiderman's) girlfriend Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) works. The CEO of Oscorp dies and Peter's old friend Harry Osborn(Dane DeHaan) who later on turn into Green Goblin becomes CEO of the Oscorp. He finds out he has a disease which can only be cured by Spiderman's blood. Peter worries that using his blood may kill him. At the same time, Max is involved in an accident, and turns him into Electro which is negative character in the movie. Max(Electro) wanted to be good person and help the city but misunderstood himself due to his appearance. The first fight between Spiderman and Electro, which is a memorable scene of the movie. To get the blood of Spiderman, Harry convinced the Electro to come with him which is also turning part of the movie. The design of Electro was not so good but green goblin was well made. I recommend this film to anyone else looking for an action, comedy and romantic film. To sum up, I think it is an overall excellent movie and I give The Amazing Spiderman 2,Eight out of Ten."
"miguel-guitarra","8","26","44","25 July 2014"," Right title for sure... AMAZING!
","Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Marvel/Graphic Novels/DC both comics and films. The thing is, many of the films falls short for real fans of heroes, be it because the actor was poorly chosen (the blatant case of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker). AWFUL! Hugh Jackman is a GOOD Wolverine for instance and Brandon Routh was a pretty Good as C.K., having big shoes to fill! Andrew Garfield looked a little strange in these two films he starred, but only for the first five minutes, which are usually filled with «woo- hoos» and an action scene to «re-introduce us» to Spidey (as if we need to be reminded of who he is, lol). So OK, we get a «happy-go-lucky Speder-Man and a somewhat air-headed Parker. But this is just for these five minutes, until one gets used to the character. Passed that, he is a pretty convincing P.P., throughout the movie, and adds a certain depth that was needed.Good work there! The villain (main) is a fairly good choice, and there's a vast choice within Spider's foes in the comics to make pretty good movies. This is by far the best Spider-Man of all so far, and I'm not even a fan! And to conclude, I think that as far as a Superhero movie goes, it's very well directed, not «crazy-cams» like in Transformers, where you don't even keep up with who's fighting who! All in all, 8/10."
"mukesh_hit123","7","26","44","13 June 2014"," Amazing but....
","I LOVED the first installment of this series (more than the second) and most beautiful part about the two parts is the love story. It was a SHOCK that they had to kill the character of Gwen Stacy specially when it is Emma Stone playing it. It left me in a sad sad feeling. <br/><br/>Another thing I could not digest was how EASILY Peter Parker moved on from her after her death (I Know the inspiration came from her own speech, but if it were myself, I could never move on). I was expecting to be shown as the spiderman officially retired, for the next installment to have even more vicious villain forcing him to return. (Kinda like The Dark Knight Rises)<br/><br/>I mean leaving all this aside, I LOVED it!"
"danielp2014","8","26","44","28 May 2014"," Not as good as I expected, but good.
","This movie was better than those with Toby Maguire, I mean, The Amazing Spiderman attach more to the original story of the comic book like Gwen's death, it happens like that in the original comic book. But there are things that I didn't like. If I made the movie I will make it the most similar to the comic, even in those tiny things like the suit, or how the cast would look. But comparing this saga with the first one, this is the best version. I really like the effects of the battle with Electro and the make up of the Green Goblin. When Gwen dies is very sad, It's very sad because you are able to get in the skin of Peter in that moment, more if you have a girlfriend or you're in love or something. I recommend this to everyone, but kids with 4 years old should not see it because it has violence that should have saw kids with 6 years old or more. I hope that the part 3 will get better."
"cfisher960","8","27","46","3 March 2015"," The more human side of Spider-Man
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is more of the emotional side of Spider- Man/Peter Parker as he is trying to figure what he wants with Gwen, what to do with Harry, etc. We also see a lot of things we haven't seen in previous Spider-Man films(although very small) like him repairing his web shooters or him washing his suit. Although they are very small things it gives us the feel of what we love so much about Spidey, he is just an ordinary person ,who deals with financial struggles and heartache,not just a superhero. <br/><br/>However what let this movie down is what the other character development. We learn more about what makes Harry Osborne/Green Goblin angry and hating Spider-Man than we do Electro,who is the main villain of the movie. Every actor portrayed their characters perfectly but was let down by a script that wasn't to thought out."
"x-m13","9","27","46","26 August 2014"," Brings out the true Comic-book Spiderman feel
","A very entertaining and gripping mix between ""funny comic book superhero"" portrayal and heartwarming, serious emotions. This is by far the best Spiderman movie of the five. <br/><br/>Right from the start you begin to realize how in this movie the action scenes are not executed in a dead-serious end of the world manner like the previous spider-man movies, which made me feel more connected to this movie than the others. This is how spider-man should have always been portrayed, unlike superman or batman. Andrew Garfield delivers the role in a very balanced and well done manner yet again. He had the chance to dive deeper into the role in this movie compared to the previous one. The chemistry between him and Emma stone on screen is one of the best aspects of this movie.<br/><br/>Another thing I enjoyed about this movie were the villains, which surprisingly everyone seemed to dislike. The characters in the movie weren't too much in any way, certainly not as much as in the previous Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>Even tho the movie didn't feel like it was something completely new, and doesn't seem to pull off something unexpected or revolutionary (In regards to film making, not Spiderman story-wise) I still felt like it was one of the most engaging and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time"
"nicholasheeralal","8","27","46","18 May 2014"," A iconic and really good film.
","An extremely good film. You don't have to be someone who is a die hard comic book fan to like this. I wasn't expecting what I got in this film. It was spectacular. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Great and emotional plot, excellent soundtrack ( The Neighborhood song, ""Honest"" was epic!), exceptional acting ( Dane DeHaan, one of which to point out) and awesome directing (Marc Webb *thumbs up*).<br/><br/>Way better than the first one. The movie seems more modern than Sam Raimi's versions. Some points in time, my heart was beating extremely fast due to the actors' dialogues. The Visual Effects editors, thumbs up to you all as well. Not much of a fan of 3-D but it was great. The first movie didn't really get me excited for this one. I went with my younger brothers to watch it.I don't regret watching it. People of all ages would enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Jaime Foxx's portrayal of Electro is also one to point out. It made me feel sad and pitiful towards his character. Andrew Garfield, to me, seems like he was born for his role. !SPOILER! He acting was top of the line when he was acting depressed towards Gwen Stacey's death.<br/><br/>I would recommend watching this film anytime you want. I would honestly buy another ticket to watch the movie again. It was that good.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 8.4 in my book, because at certain points (very few), I felt a little bored but other than that, The movie is amazing. I can see why they call it The AMAZING Spiderman. *Ba dumb tss*"
"oiscs18","8","28","48","30 January 2015"," Slightly disappointing but Saved By Electro - MAY BE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","in my opinion Electro is one of the coolest spider-man villains, his designed looked epic and so were his powers and Jamie Foxx was very good playing him. Also his soundtrack was very good and added to the whole powerful feel of electro. The acting in this film was very good and believable and so was the romance between Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield). The storyline was very interesting and there was the right number of villains in the film, however i do believe that the goblin was shoved in at the end just to kill Gwen, and the Rhino just to set up other films. So therefore i think Harry Osborn should have had more screen time as the goblin. Furthermore, it would have been better if the whole thing with spider-man quitting after Gwen's death should have continued until the end of the film and the next film should have started with spider-man returning and fighting the rhino. More reasons why i was disappointed are that Norman Osborn got about 4 minutes screen time and a lot of the movie was wasted on a stupid, boring sub story about Peter trying to find out about his dad which lead to one moment that was relevant to the plot ; the bit about the spider venom. However as i have previously mentioned, these disappointing and frustrating things were partly made up for by electro. I enjoyed every elector scene and they were all exhilarating. So overall a very good film with a few flaws here and it set up future films very well, which I'm am very much looking forward to."
"chaz_merida","8","28","48","3 June 2014"," Another Amazing Spiderman movie, but...
","THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 !!!!!SPOILERS ALERT!!!! This new chapter of the Spiderman comic book character, Amazing Spiderman 2, is a solid good movie. The movie contains a considerable amount of information that is released in sequential order concerning Oscorp, the Green Goblin, and the Sinister Six.<br/><br/>The death of Gwen Stacy was simply tragic and drew tears everywhere in the theater. This moment was well crafted and executed. The dramatic ride from the beginning of Green Goblin's appearance to the ending moment was awesome! But that alone I cannot give the movie higher than a B.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie spent nearly a full 15 minutes on characters that were dead and too easily referenced by a line or two to warrant such a waste of time.<br/><br/>The villain Electro's storyline was exactly parallel to the Ridler's story from Batman Forever, and the character similarities before the birth of the villain was so intentional – that I could have played the Batman movie side by side and not seen any difference whatsoever.<br/><br/>When Electro was born, he became unlike the comic book villain and yes more powerful, but the villain wasn't actually an evil villain, he was a confused, psychologically unbalanced character that had passionate hate towards Spiderman that wasn't actually justified. The end of Electro was a good thing, this villain couldn't possibly work for another movie.<br/><br/>The Green Goblin, aka Harry Osborn – not Norman, was an interesting plot twist; however the introduction of Harry Osborn was a serious problem within the story plot. In the previous movie, Amazing Spiderman, Harry was not introduced at all and now this guy is Peter Parker's best friend. Anyone who read the book knows they were but if you didn't read the book and just came to see the sequel, you are surprised to see Peter's non best / best friend comes out of nowhere and not so much as a back story of the story of the two characters. Yes, that 15 minutes about Peter's parents would have done nicely to introduce Harry the right way. But nope, they didn't.<br/><br/>The Rhino at the very end was not a surprise or twist at all. It was more like throwing the last egg at the house where 11 other eggs could be seen dripping. The movie ended with Spiderman and the Rhino fighting in the street. The scene before that with the child was awesome and the Re-Introduction of Spiderman was damn good. This scene still doesn't reduce the deliberate shock of the movie ending with not so much a hint at MaryJane Watson.<br/><br/>I like the movie, and will buy it when it becomes available. The action scenes are great and the characters are real. Andrew Garfield in my opinion is a much better Spiderman than Tobey Maguire by far. And Gwen Stacy will always, as before, be missed!"

Let me tell you why.<br/><br/>Firstly because Andrew Garfield fits perfectly for the role of Peter Parker and also does Emma Stone for Gwen Stacy. A real, honest love between these two characters. It is so powerful that I felt it when they look at each other, talk to each other and in every other romantic scene. I know you expect a great superhero movie with a lot of action, with a good villain but this movie is something more than just a superhero movie. This is a really great romance that in the end it almost made me cry. <br/><br/>Another thing about this movie is that I really like the villain and Jamie Foxx was really good at being Electro. Not much action and battles between spiderman and Electro but that is what makes this superhero movie so special.<br/><br/>And the last thing may contain a little spoiler(do not read it if you want to watch the movie for the 1st time).

So there is amazing Spider-Man 3 coming 2016 and amazing Spider- Man 4 in 2018. But let us talk about amazing Spider-Man 2 and the Spider-Man 2 in 2004 so we can compare it to each other.

Over to Spider-Man 2 it has got some rubbery moments and only 1 villain doc ock and also boring stuff so amazing Spider-Man two Is a big improvement from amazing Spider-Man 2012 and although it's sometimes silly it's really entertaining for people everywhere but of course amazing Spider-Man 2012 is so silly and unneeded(SOZ mark Webb) so yeah"

How can you claim that the costume was not perfect? The most important, how can you deny that it was a spectacular film? With especially its Times Square battle and Peter Parker, I think this movie was nearly flawless. <br/><br/>If we talk about Rhino problem, I believe it was the best ending that could have ever been made.

I mean sure, Spiderman jokes more than enough this time around and the drama seems to take up most of the movie, but that's a lot how the comic book was as well. I think the story was very progressive this time and there were moments where I honestly felt like hugging the person sitting next to me while watching Peter and Gwen go through their love life. The special effects and camera angles were very neatly put together and I thought the action was pretty amazing too... no pun intended.

The two main villain arcs are very well done as are all the characters. They are engaging and are what the directors clearly wanted to drive this movie. That and the tense action sequences impressed me greatly. People say this is has too many subplots and here is the thing, the spiderman comic books are all driven by subplots with one huge plot hiding in the shadows and this film makes me excited for the sequels due to its pitch perfect storytelling and perfect performances.

"cmyers87","8","30","52","28 May 2014"," Pleasing Followup to a Great Reboot
","Having watched the last Spiderman Trilogy slowly spiral into barely above a B-Movie, I was worried that the reboot may follow it's path. Besides that, we all know that historically Marvel movies weren't as good; although Disney has done wonders to overcoming that stigma. I'm happy to say that I was not only pleasantly proved wrong, but I left with a sense of readiness for the next installment! Anyone that knows the older canon for Spiderman knows that Stone's role is pivotal, and I won't say more than that. Even though I was expecting most of what happened, it was fun to watch it all unfold, and it was great to see certain images in the background of future villains. Keep your eyes peeled for fun gadgets, people! The story moved expertly, the acting was on par, and the filmography was all done very well. Stone and Garfield kept the awkward teen chemistry going, which is exactly what I liked so much about the two of them in the first one.<br/><br/>I'm honestly having a hard time saying much about this movie without giving anything away, so I'll simply say this was a great moment in single-hero Marvel Movies.<br/><br/>All of that being said, there are always some cons to go with the pros. There were parts of the movie that felt slower than they had to be, not because I was being told any great point of story; it actually felt more like filler to me. I feel like the role of Osborn/Goblin should have been more significant than it was, and I hope the lack of gravity for this character means we'll see A LOT more of him down the road (this was hinted at, but again ... trying to avoid spoilers). Finally, I really feel like I need to know more about his parents. Not really for the plot of this film, but just based on how interesting and tangled (pardon the web pun) the back story could get.<br/><br/>Losing two points might seem harsh for a bit of slow story and the less-than-there Goblin role, but I stand by my 8/10. It may be a personal bias, but the Goblin was one of my favorite villains and, in my opinion, one of the more important. Being both an enemy and a friend - a frenemy, if you will - makes me feel like we missed a lot that could have been."
"snipes-black767","9","30","52","17 April 2014"," Holy Crap
","I was not excited about this movie at all. The trailers looked bloated with CGI action and it reminded me of spider-man 3,with the overuse of villains,and Dane DeHaan as the green goblin? That looked ridiculous. I think its safe to say that this movie was one of the most surprising movies I've seen in a while. It started out a bit cartoonish,but in a good way,it felt like spider-man. They balanced out the 3 villains really well and you believed Jamie,Dane and Paul as the villains they portray. Andrew Garfield absolutely owns the roll of spider-man,as we could already tell back in 2012 with the first movie. Emma stone is still killing it as Gwen Stacey and you really end up caring for their relationship. This movie takes a lot from the Amazing Spider-man issues #120 and #121,so if you've read those devastating comic books you know about the chilling end one of the main characters will face. In conclusion,the only people who wont enjoy this movie are either Anti-superhero tight-asses or people who generally hate fun. Enjoy."

","I loved the original spider-mans but I really do prefer Andrew Garfield as the main man, he plays the character a lot better than Tobey Maguire. First things first this film was great, plenty of action, romance and drama. The CGI was fantastic and what they did to Jamie Foxx's character Electro was amazing it was like he was a complete different person! You learn a little more on peters parents and were introduced to Harry Osbourne Aka Peters best friend (well in the originals he was) this was a great marvel film made and I will always watch the new spider man films until they stop making them because they're brilliant.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT! The only thing I was disappointed with in this film was that Gwen Stacey dies *sobs* I heard that she was going to be killed off but I wasn't sure that it would be in this movie. I did actually cry a little because I loved her character and the chemistry between her and Peter (The real life couple) was spot on. I really wished they hadn't of killed her off because Emma stone played that character so good now we have to see peter fall in love all over again with Mary Jane (that's if they bring that character into the third movie) but all in all this film was a 10/10"
"Rage-Kage","8","31","54","1 June 2014"," About as good as the 1st
","I had pretty high expectations for The Amazing Spiderman 2 going in and for the most part it really didn't disappoint me. I love Andrew Garfield as Pete Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey as well as some of the varies side character like aunt May. I really loved the first Amazing Spiderman when it was released. I loved seeing a new much more believable take on really every character that was in the original Raimi trilogy (peter, Gwen, aunt May and Uncle Ben just for example). I found all these characters to be very likable and actually useful and intelligent unlike in the Raimi trilogy.<br/><br/>The amazing Spiderman 2 definitely had a lot of the things I liked about the first one for example the creative way Peter uses his web shooters. I love watching him do things like putting his finger over one to make it shoot web in 2 different directions or like in the first movie when he used his web to find the lizard. I also like how Gwen Stacey is actually useful unlike Mary Jane. It's cool to see her try to find ways to help peter when he battles against the bad guys. I suppose its not official or anything but I think that aunt May knows Peter is Spiderman which is really cool because I'm pretty sure people close to him would be pretty suspicious.<br/><br/>One thing that I really missed in this movie though was the lack of some of the side characters from the first one in particular Flash. I really liked how he started out as a jerk but turned out to be an okay guy.It was a smaller detail but I really liked the dynamics between him and Peter and I was hoping to see more of that. i have heard rumors though that Flash will become Venom in a future film so I hope that that is the case.<br/><br/>Now I just want to give my opinion on some of the major complaints that I have heard.<br/><br/>1. To many villains with sloppy under developed story arcs<br/><br/>2. To much romance<br/><br/>I completely understand where both of these complaints come from but I have to disagree with them both. The Amazing Spiderman 2 was really more of a set up for future installments in the franchise which I know irritates people. For me though being a BIG fan of following long running TV shows and waiting all season for the big pay off of each season for whatever show I'm watching this did not bother me about the movie. I don't mind at all that this movie had a lot of set up because IMO it was an entertaining movie by itself as well. As for the romance all I really have to say is I didn't mind it because Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone work Pretty well together.<br/><br/>So overall I really enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman 2 but I liked the first one just a little bit more. I also realize that I did a fair amount of trash talking about the Raimi trilogy which means that this review will automatically be rated down by a lot of people who see it... but oh well it's just my opinion on the 2 separate franchises.<br/><br/>I give The Amazing Spiderman 2 an 8/10"

","17 April 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza, Dorchester Tonight - The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (3D) - Marvellous Marvel does it again. If nothing else a Marvel film is entertaining, but this film was definitely better than just entertaining. A mix of superhero, ordinary folk, internal struggles and battles against the bad guys, this film also had quite a few laugh out loud moments too. One of the most telling story lines yet this episode deals with the internal struggles that Peter Parker goes through to balance his everyday life, with family, love of his girl and his obligation to save the general population. I know as the audience we are privy to all the secrets on the good side and the bad side, but it never ceases to amaze me that the person closest to him, his Aunt May, has never discovered the spider suit which is just sitting in a heap in his closet, open your eyes lady, the guy you raised from a small boy is one of the coolest super heroes around. I quite like Andrew Garfield as Spider Man, he balances his fun side with the angst needed to capture this story line to perfection. 3D gets better and better by the way!!!!"
"vid8","8","31","54","16 April 2014"," A solid, entertaining film.
","So soon after Tobey Maguire's Spiderman Trilogy, the decision to reboot the franchise may have been seen as bizarre to some. However, the first in this new series, Amazing Spider-Man, was thoroughly entertaining, and this second instalment has similarly impressed. In the film, Spider-Man has to deal with new enemies including Electro and the Green Goblin, as well as Rhino. The action scenes were refreshingly good and, although there were too many romantic scenes for my liking, which in turn made the movie slightly too long, they were humorous at times - throughout the movie, there were scenes which triggered a few laughs from the audience which lightened up the production. Having said that, I don't think that it was as dark as the first instalment. All in all, a film worth seeing."
"jasperjfcs","7","32","56","28 June 2014"," I rate this movie 8.5/10
","I wanted to see this movie more than any other for 2014. I got my hopes up and was very excited and then the day came to see it with my girlfriend and I LOVED IT! For me, it had great humor, great acting (especially Andrew Garfield) and a great story. Many disagree though but to be honest I think it mostly gets bad reviews and ratings because it's not a depressing movie that is 100% realistic with a lot of swearing like most of the other TV shows and movies that get the highest ratings. Not much of a chance is given for these fantasy films anymore but they have always been my favorite movies and if I ever do get to make movies when I'm older, you can bet they will be funny, imaginative, action packed and completely awesome for all ages! The Amazing Spider-Man 2 for me is one of those movies.<br/><br/>Now, of course I don't think that a movie can be 100% perfect. There are some things I don't like about this film such as how different it was put together compared to the first movie. I personally don't like a sequel with so many changes. It feels like we have to adjust to a new environment too much so we can't continue the story we started. I am surprised it was this different even though it had the same director but the music composer was different, the credits were edited differently, the costume was better but still different. The two new Star Trek movies are examples of two movies that are set up the same way and can tell the story we came to see and that's one of the reason I love them both. The two Johnny English films are examples of two movies that are set up so differently as if the sequel just forgot the first movie. I personally can't continue following a story so well when it's sequel is set up so differently compared to the first. <br/><br/>I also didn't care much for the way some parts of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 were set up. I believe some parts of the movie could have been in different places but it wasn't much of a problem for me.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie made me smile, laugh and cry. It is the exact kind of movie I can watch again and again and enjoy and I walked out of the cinema on the 17th of April 2014 and smiling."

I personally and most of my friends think, this is by far the best Spiderman movie out there in the whole spiderman universe. The Character of Peter Parker is spot on. He's smart, witty and funny all at the same time. The romance between Peter and Gwen was spot on too. I loved all the action sequences in the movie. It is a fun ride. Its not a cry baby spiderman movie like the ones we have with the Toby McGuire series. I watched this movie twice the very same day and I felt the nostalgia of being a kid again watching a very uplifting superhero. All in all this movie deserves a far better rating and the industry should hold on from introducing another remake here.

","I was really surprised after watching this movie! Not only was the VFX extremely good, but the plot was also awesome and detailed. They show you that; spiderman is a human, he can't save everyone, without making enemies. Everyone was good in this movie, even police officers were good in this movie. I feel that Marc Webb (the director) has learned from his mistakes, no more wannabe spidey, no more trying to funny! And finally, finally, we learn more about his parents. The story is realistic, if you think about it in a superhero movie perspective. They show you the sad part of spiderman's story, they show you the phycology of spidey and almost all the enemies. The vfx are really impressing too, I even think there could might be a Oscar nomination for it.<br/><br/>The ending was too fast though, they had the chance to stop it at the right time. But instead they overworked it. There were some parts of the movie, where they tried to be funny, even though it wasn't.... But all and all, the movie was awesome and epic. AWESOME MOVIE, AWESOME DAY. Strong 8/10"
"jackgradis","8","35","62","5 July 2014"," This is what Comic Book Movies are supposed to be like
","For starters, let me say that this is not a perfect movie. The first act is rushed, and the plot loosens as the movie progresses. But this is what comic book movies should be like. Fun, action-packed, and believable performances are what make this movie good. It is not trying to be The Dark Knight, which I enjoyed. There are a few darker moments, but the overall feel of the movie is light and fun. That tone is perfect for Spidey movies, and that is where I think Sam Raimi went wrong with his Spider-Man trilogy. He wanted to make a good film, not a good Spider-Man film. Mark Webb is making good Spider-Man films, so critics are not liking it because they view it the same as they would Shawshank Redemption. And fans aren't on board because they want all superhero movies to be ""darker"". Ask Man Of Steel how that worked out. So just sit back and enjoy a fun ride with beautiful visuals and outstanding acting."

","Although i thought the film was great, i did feel the ending let it down slightly. the death of Gwen ruined it for me. it made the fact of her going to oxford in england irrelevant. they gave you false hope of spider-man going to england and maybe continuing his adventure there. the death of Gwen was a little to full on for my liking. following the death of Gwen makes the next spider-man film less exciting for me.<br/><br/>their relationship is a huge part to the spider-man films and now thats gone the films will never be the same. <br/><br/>apart from that i thought the acting was brilliant and spider-man/peter parker is played amazingly."

","This film is getting too much hate by some people and too much love by others (including me), and it seems to be only based on the mental image each group has of spider-man and movie scripts in general.<br/><br/>Those who love the soup opera aspects of Peter Park, hated, they missed the character grow, the motives of the villains (arguable) and complained for having too many story lines. On the other hand those who love comic spidey, loved, for all the stupid puns, the charisma and the of course the action. But the main complain is about the script, but understanding as a comic adaptation, it makes sense, the several sub-plots going on between each fight,the preface and Peter Parker/Spider-Man parallels objectives, it makes just like a regular comic (weekly or monthly) and less like a regular movie.<br/><br/>But What can I say, I was expecting to see the real (mental image, again) Spider-Man on screen, the costume is really (a lot of emphasis here) beautiful, Andrew Garfield really is in the character, Emma Stone makes an active love interest, Dane DeHaan makes a 'realistic' Green Goblin and Paul Giamatti goes a over-the-top, more related to an usual Spider-Man Villain. The only big flaw is Jamie Foxx getting the spotlight just because Django, the character is lost in the movie, half-way between fun villain and real threat, shame because he is the main villain.<br/><br/>Marc Webb got me, I'm gonna be the first in line for: The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom-Carnage, Sinister Six, maybe Spider-Woman (not confirmed yet), or any other release of a fun comic adaptation."

","I just came home from the cinemas right now and I just want to break it to you all, The Amazing Spider Man 2 is one of THE BEST movies! directors like Matt Webb and Neil Burger? Oh man you guys are great!!! I'm the worst movie critique so accept the fact that I love this movie! I was so disappointed with the first one and at first, I didn't want to watch the second movie either. But after watching this movie, my, I'm breathless...Consider my mind blown away! First of all, I love Andrew Garfield. I could feel him in his scenes... His words, his actions, his feelings. They were so intense! I love Emma Stone! Aside from being the perfect girl for Andrew, I have to say, you're a great actress, Emma! This film is quite different from other action-adventure movies...I hate movies with a bad guy, sometimes supernatural, and then the good guy comes out, whooping saves the day. THE END (just like the first amazing spider man movie) But the second movie? Wow. Took me off guard, actually. It's centered on a normal guy turned extraordinary. It's centered on THE GUY! and his life, his family, his decisions. I love that. I never knew that could be applied to adventure movies. Overall, it's a big thumbs up for me. I love how Spider man is so cool and chill all the time! And the bits of comedy, suspense? love it! Though I don't quite agree with Gwen dying in the end, because she's actually what keeps Peter alive, I accept the fact that things don't always go your way in reality. It's just so tragic that Gwen died. I feel so sorry for Peter. They were both perfect. Okay so that's it! I love Andrew, Emma and the others! Matt Webb! Feel great guys, I appreciate you talented people! You should never change, feel good but keep humility. Must watch! Great film!"
"zak_broncos","9","20","33","30 April 2014"," Best Spider-Man movie ever!
","Being a huge fan of Spider-Man comics and the first movie of this franchise, I went to the advanced screening of this movie and I'm so glad that I did. This movie blew my mind. One minute you're happy, next you're sad. This movie is one giant emotional roller-coaster.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant all round. The only disappointing performance was Jamie Foxx but that can be overlooked. The standout performance was definitely Emma Stone. She nailed the role and played a very good partner for Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker.<br/><br/>The characters were all unique and also interesting. This movie did a very good job at handling three villains. Dane DeHaan was a much better Harry Osborne than James Franco. He really understood the character he was playing and that translated in his performance. Jamie Foxx as I mentioned earlier wasn't very good in this movie but that's because Max Dillon wasn't a very good character. As Electro, he was fine, but Max Dillon didn't feel like a character you can relate to or a likable character. The Rhino was only there for a short amount of time but I felt that was enough. He payed his part and didn't overstay his welcome.<br/><br/>The music was really well written. Hanz Zimmer did a very good job at capturing the character's personalities and it was very well composed. Saying that, the music didn't fit the situation at times. When Electro was trying to understand what has happened to him, light, jumpy music was playing when I felt the scene was serious.<br/><br/>The CGI in this movie was amazing. It went a little downhill during the fight scene between Electro and Spider-Man, but other than that is was really good. While watching this movie, I believed that Spider-Man was actually swinging around New York. The animations for the swinging was believable and flowed really well.<br/><br/>The movie was fun to watch because of the costume designs and the make up. The Green Goblin looked really cool and creepy and his suit was alright. They might want to change the look of it in future films though. Spider-Man's suit got an upgrade and it is better than the first movie's and looks a lot like the comics. When Gwen Stacey died, she was wearing almost the exact same thing she was wearing in the comics.<br/><br/>To be completely honest, while watching this movie, I cried. It was the first time I have ever cried in a movie and I am so glad it was this one. The scene where Gwen died was emotional and very well done. It felt like she was falling forever and that was a good thing because you didn't really know if she was going to survive or not.<br/><br/>I am really glad Sony still has the rights to this character because if Marvel studios had done it, we wouldn't get Gwen Stacey at all and we would be stuck with Mary Jane. If Marvel had the rights to Spider-Man, they wouldn't have killed Gwen Stacey like they have in this movie.<br/><br/>The ending was one of the best parts. In superhero movies, you don't get to see what happens after the ""big fight"", but in this movie, you see how Peter reacts to Gwen dying and he tries to fit back into his life. It's really rare to see and when done right, it can be amazing.<br/><br/>Overall this is a really great movie you can watch with the whole family. In my opinion it is better than Spider-Man 2, but I'm sure there will be people that disagree. I loved it and can't wait for the next one."

","I had always been (somehow) against the remake, and even with the first Amazing Spider-Man being a success, Tobey Maguire has always been the better Spiderman in my heart. I chanced upon the opportunity to watch the first Amazing movie just two months before The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Ok, I was actually forced to watch it), I can't help but compare how different the character of the two Peter Parkers (Tobey Maguire's and Andrew Garfield's) as well as the relationship between Peter Parker and his uncle (Well, I prefer the latter). Relationship-wise, it's a Peter Parker-Mary Jane versus Peter Parker-Gwen Stacey, so comparing it will be like comparing apples and oranges. Although I've got to admit the effects of the Amazing Spider-Man trilogy is much better (10 years does a lot for the CGI).<br/><br/>Moreover, I always wonder why Spider-Man isn't in the Avengers alliance with my favourite Captain America, so all I can say is that I wasn't exactly super keen to catch the Amazing Spider-Man 2. But well, Sony Pictures Singapore's invitation to catch the sneak preview changed my mind. In fact, I start to worry if it will supersede my favourite Marvel Hero's Winter Soldier's movie shown less than a month ago.<br/><br/>Peter Parker aka the Amazing Spider-Man aka Andrew Garfield A more confident Spider-Man, with an almost Tony-Stark arrogance (he's not as wealthy though), Andrew Garfield plays a character which is completely different from Tobey Maguire's. The best and worst thing about the movie was his relationship with Gwen Stacey. While girls love the sweet albeit complicated relationship, some online Spidey fans find it too draggy. I love the genuine chemistry between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield (Duh, I'm a girl too), the lines, the little actions, the romance is so real that it gave me the same feeling Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron did back in High School Musical.<br/><br/>The Villains Many people were skeptical of Jamie Foxx being casted as the Electro because he's a Black (How racist!) but after watching his performance in Django Unchained and White House Down, he is one actor who can take up any role and be that character. Of course, i have to credit the Amazing soundtracks and songs by Hans Zimmer that brought out and enhanced the anger in Max Dillon (the Electro). It is in fact one of the rare times that I actually noticed the songs/soundtracks in a movie. Through the music, I could feel so much of the Electro's anger that I can't help but feel for him. He is indeed the reason why Spider-Man 2 is so amazing.<br/><br/>The Green Goblin in the Amazing Spider-Man 2 is no longer just suit and armour, but also ...<br/><br/>Read more: http://tiffanyyong.com/2014/04/30/amazing-spider-man-2-movie- review/"

","The Amazing Spider Man 2 continues the story of the franchise, as Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) continues to be the iconic marvel hero. Although promising to tear his relationship apart with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) to her father, Peter and her continues to see each other, as Spider Man keeps being the hero of New York City. Meanwhile, a new villain appears, Electro (Jamie Foxx) an ex-employee of Oscorp Corp. accidentally turned into a blue skinned person with electric powers, that seeks revenge from Spider Man. At the same time another super villain assembles, Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan), previously Harry Osborn, the owner of Oscop Corp., that turned himself to overcome a degenerative disease and also for defeating the protagonist. Differently from the previous movie, The Amazing Spider Man 2 had more special effects, more complex action scenes and more differentiated soundtrack, as Electro's electric powers requires this developments to be better represented compared to Lizard's powers. Even being an outstanding movie, in a technical way, what contributed to this movie not being as good as the first one in a general way was the fact of having two villains. In the limited time of two and a half hours was not possible to both of these very differently characters have the necessary development to the public understand or create some connection with them. Most of the time some more detailed explanations would be necessary, as for instance detailing more how the power of the villain works, or how the studies of Richard Parker, Peter's deceased father, were developed and connected to Spider-Man's fate or introducing some flash backs of how Peter and Harry met and became friends. Furthermore, Amazing Spider Man 2, even though not being another master piece of Marvel productions, is an spectacular action and visual movie, enjoyable to the hole public, but just only if character development or the plot quality is not your priority."

","This could be the movie of the year for me definitely this movie is so amazing and so good I think a stupid rating 7.4 is so low it should have been beyond 8 but I rate it high mostly because of visual effects,Andrew Garfield+Emma Stone,Dane DeHaan's amazing play and the sadness in the end.<br/><br/>This movie is funny is sad is amazing in every aspect. A.Garfield topped this movie no doubt the best Spider-Man movie ever and until now one of the best movies of this year it just couldn't be better. From what I watched this year this movie is far better than any one else except I am waiting to see Dawn of the Planes of the Apes to see if is any better but until now this one is the best one yet,"
"kyleluna","10","25","43","21 September 2014"," The best in the Spider Man series even though its flawed and rushed.
","Let me say that I'm a huge Spider Man fan ever since I saw the original Sam Raimi trilogy and I love the early series but when I learned that there were issues in the early film series I lost interest and I never watched any of Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy again after learning about its issues. But when I heard they were rebooting it with a new director and casts along with the same production team returning to make a brand new Spider Man film I was super excited. When I saw the 2012 reboot I was surprised and I started to like the series again. Now this year when I watched The Amazing Spider Man 2 the series seem to get better and better while Raimi's films are extremely flawed forever. Marc Webb's reboot films is making good progress. I remember being at the exclusive premiere of this film in IMAX back in April 30 me and my sister hit the exclusive late screening of the film which is at 11:55 pm to 2:00 am in the morning and when we watched it I was super amazed with it and I so love the new Spider Man film its even better than the previous films because this film like Spider Man 3 because the film has too many characters from the comic books where as Spider Man 3 failed due to the presence of too many characters from the comics and less screen time for the villains like Venom who was 2 or 3 minutes only in the film The Amazing Spider Man 2 worked a lot more even though there are way too many characters from the comics it managed to stay in the proper direction in terms of character development and introducing new characters even though this movie is way too rushed than Spider Man 3 because when we get to see a bunch of new characters Marc Webb seriously handled everything very well unlike Raimi who seriously worked way too hard and failed when the third Spider Man film was released Webb did a slightly better job than how Raimi worked on his films. One of the film's main highlights of course is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone and it gives the movie a very good feel something the Sam Raimi's films failed to do and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's chemistry will always be better than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's chemistry in the early films also the new villain Electro is amazing and the design of Electro is superb and it is way better than the Lizard's design in the first film. Plus one of the other film's highlights is the CGI and special effects which is always the highlight of the Spider Man films even in the Sam Raimi trilogy(The Sandman special effects are my personal favorite in the early films)but I love the special effects here way better and I would say that The Amazing Spider Man 2 has the best special effects in the series since Spider Man 2 and 3. OK it maybe rushed and flawed but they are easy to forget once you see the movie's highlights which are extremely unstoppable in the film and will keep you glued to the screen until the end and while we did see a couple of characters that we've seen before like the Osborn family what's great about reintroducing the early characters from the early films is that they are not only portrayed by new actors who give a stunning and amazing plus mesmerizing performance but I love how they are given a darker back story than in the early films. Overall The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a great sequel to the 2012 reboot and is a major improvement also to its predecessor in terms of character development, special effects, designs and stunning visuals and this is where the series get to expand where we are introduced to a lot of new characters and learn a lot more about the characters and I'm hoping that The Amazing Spider Man 3 and the spin offs will expand the Spider Man universe a bit more and have bigger and better fights."
"sixtydaysofhonestymovie","4","117","236","20 April 2014"," Not greater than the sum of its parts
","Off the starting line here, let me address that the film being marketed is essentially not the film you get. The entire ""Enemies unite, and his ultimate battle begins"" is not what happens here. In-fact the poster where Spiderman is facing off against Electro, Green Goblin, and Rhino, is a border-line breach of trading standards when you have seen the film. They only ever fight him individually, and at separate points in the film. Also, the new Rhino, including the scenes heavily used in all the trailers - only appears as the CLOSING SCENE of the film. With that information out the way, is the film any good? Not particularly. Andrew and Emma are wonderful together on screen and keep the film alive, but whenever the film is left to be carried by the male cast it is left for dead because the script, the characters... it just isn't there. It's a series of convenient events that just happen in order, to reach the end and set up a hopefully superior part 3. A wasted opportunity with a cast that were not given the right tools they needed to do their job - a decent story and script."
"The-Sarkologist","4","121","245","17 April 2014"," I'm not finding this reboot all that enjoyable
","I am not really all that sure about this film, and as I was watching it just kept on thinking that I found the Sam Rami/Toby Maguire Spiderman films so much better. In fact, right from the beginning of this film, with Spiderman running around teasing the crooks that he was chasing, made me think that this film was actually quite stupid. Also, there is also the case that the current actor playing Spiderman reminds me of the actor that played Harry Osborne in the Rami movies.<br/><br/>There are two bad guys in this film, Electro and the Green Goblin, and I am not really sure why they subtitled this film 'The Rise of Electro' because it appears that Electro will not be returning for any further films (or I do not suspect that he will) though it does appear that the Green Goblin will. The other thing that annoyed me was that in the Rami films Spiderman never kills anybody whereas in this film he does. I suspect that the reason that Spiderman does not attempt to kill his enemies is the same reason that Batman refuses to do so, and that is because by doing so one will end up becoming just like those they are hunting.<br/><br/>It also seemed to be somewhat more cobbled together, especially with the Osborne, Peter Parker friendship. It seemed as if, all of a sudden, it turns out that they were friends whereas in the Rami films it was established right from the beginning that they were friends and had been friends for quite a while. Oh, and there is a mid-credits scene in this film, but I am not going back just to find out what it was (because I can find out from the internet anyway), but I guess next time I won't simply rush out of the cinema to go to the toilet (and it is even more annoying with end credit scenes)."
"powerfull_jedi","5","104","209","17 April 2014"," The Not So-Amazing Spiderman Movie...
","I felt something was off from the moment I laid eyes on the first trailer for this movie.<br/><br/>And here's the gist of it: Whatever bad impressions you got from the movie based on the promotional material, I'm sad to say that all the negative impressions came true in this 2 hour action flick.<br/><br/>What's wrong with it? Plenty. TAS tried to imitate The Dark Knight and it did OK. This one, however tries to take the same approach: One main antagonist that spawns another major antagonist, but everything here reeks of Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>But these villains are simply all setup with next to no payoff. Jaime Foxx's character is billed as one of the central antagonists, but really nothing more than a hired muscle with a motivation that would make even Joel Schumacher cringe. He also wears an outfit that feels like a rejected Fantastic Four costume. Harry Obsborn at the beginning has some promise but ultimately he's barely a presence in the movie. He's Two-Face, if he were written by The Farelly Brothers instead of Jonathan Nolan.<br/><br/>Oh and that amazing revelation 'bout Peter's parents and their tragic ""accident""? All this setup (with a fairly impressive opening scene) for a 3-minute grainy Youtube video in which Pete's Dad gives us some exposition that can summed up in ""Oscorp is evil"". Thank you, I wasn't aware of that.<br/><br/>Romance is still awkward, the actress who plays Aunt May seems to have forgotten how to act.<br/><br/>You can argue that TAS did too much in trying to expand upon Peter Parker's life, Ben's death and the hunt for said killer and all that. But the sequel on the other hand seems to think that ""less is more"", when really it feels like ""stuff just happens"".<br/><br/>Since when did Spidey develop Jedi-like evil sensing powers? Why does Pete only see Captain Stacey when the plot demands it? Why are the police and firefighters more than willing to let Spidey call the shots since he is still technically a vigilante? Was Gwen fired from Oscorp? And if not, did they pretend she didn't exist after she walked out of the building? They were keeping tabs on Harry hanging out with Peter and the electric guy that nobody gave a flying hoot about and nothing was done to the one random employee that happened to search for Max Dillon's name? Oh and Harry doesn't get killed yet because he knows his way out? How does that work? Is Peter in colleague yet? 'Cause it's a little hard to tell, since he's either fighting crime or making a meager wage sending photos to the Daily Buggle. How come a genius like Peter doesn't know 8th grade science? How does a damaged webshooter work to magically save a whole lot of people from being shocked? Who is Mr. Friers? And does Harry get back to normal?<br/><br/>So much stuff that doesn't work..."

","Lets give a disclaimer here: I am a comic book nerd-geek and Spider-Man is one of my favorite fictional characters ever, so maybe I am inclined to be fully absorbed by this movie very easily, yet this doesn't take away from my film nerd-fan side that genuinely thought very highly of this film from a simple filmaking point of view. As storytelling goes I was very-pleasantly surprised to find a really strong grip: it never commits the Spider-Man 3 mistake of being over-crowded and maintains a brilliant balance on all the characters flowing naturally with a story that feels perfectly fine despite the pressure it had from Sony. It never tries to be over intricate but manages to pull of multiple inter-twining story lines in a magnificent way. Never does it leave loose ends and that is something I hadn't seen in a comic-book movie for a couple of years. Furthermore it isn't a banal plot, there of course are some clichÃ©d moments but as much as they don't get me in 90% of movies they got me here (credit to director/actors for making those few feel very spontaneous), it has valid originality and keeps a core fidelity to the source material that deserves high praise. Just as good is the way in which this sequel builds on its predecessor tying up loose ends, proceeding with minor story lines of the first movie and adding great parts in it. As a director Webb proves to be amazing. The action scenes are complexly put together, with visual brilliance and continuity in them. Great improvement from the first movie. They really were breathtaking, nail-biting sequences that found me on the edge of my seat continuously. Another visual aspect that is stunning is the swinging sequences of Spider-Man: this is what I always wanted to see but never fully experienced with the other Spider-Man movies; the shots there were fantastic. Yet what I most admire Webb for is the talent he has for character development and coherence, we have seen this in his previous two movies and here it is firing once again in all cylinders. There just isn't one character in whom I did not believe, I never spotted the stereotypical comic-book person in here. Everybody had there chance to shine. Sure a couple of characters have minor short-comings and I understand if somebody doesn't believe in Electro's personality, but I found that it walked the line between movie acceptability and comic-book campyness in the perfect dose. To this I also have to give credit to the soundtrack which blew me totally away when Electro is introduced to the public: that was some serious use of music and sounds for storytelling, brilliant, intelligent! Adding to this is a really powerful score from Hans Zimmer, one of the better ones I have heard from him and generally in recent years. Our introduction to Harry Osborn/Green Goblin was positive on the character part (indeed there was no need for him to be green goblin in this one but I honestly did not mind him), yet from an acting point of view I think Dane Dehaan overacted in some scenes, nevertheless he was good enough. There have been many criticisms of this movie in regards to messy tone, unoriginality and rushed villains and as much as I see where people are coming from and I would indeed have appreciated a more untraditional villain(s) introduction and story I just never thought of that during the movie: there are many movies in which I simply cannot be taken in because of originality issues, but for some reason this one felt to me so fluent I never had any problems with this and actually felt it kept a consistent tone throughout. Yet I must address the fact that watching it twice I could feel the studio putting too much of its hand in the movie: they were way to manipulative of this and I think that by leaving Marc Webb just some more creative power this movie could have been enormously better. The CGI wasn't always seamless but great in many moments and anyways it never bothered me because the story was always the driving force behind it and what I was most interested in: this also speaks to the fact that the action was used to propel the plot so it never felt out of place, that is something really hard to pull off. There is lots of humor in the film and I can safely say that it actually is very funny and very faithful to who Spider-Man is and how he acts and to expand on this the humor fits both the tone of the movie and the storytelling, speaking again to the fact that, just like the action, it is used appropriately for the character development or the story, it is never gratuitous. I was excepting more fan service, but I can't really fault the movie for not satisfying my unsatisfiable thirst for it, that was nevertheless kept at bay. ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" truly was a comic book movie. It took the best aspects of the two world and combined them in what I always figured in my head when I read Spider-Man comics. Yet, I have been holding back this for all my review and here it is: what truly is the best part of the movie, the most riveting element, the thing that Webb does best in a really majestical way, the driving force behind this film, the main reason and thing that kept me most absorbed in the drama and what gives it honest emotional depth is the relationship between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker. honestly do not know how Webb is so amazingly good with romance and character interaction but what we have here (and in the previous movie) is something really special."
"aarondwasserman","9","16","26","14 September 2014"," My thoughts on The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","The first time I saw this movie (opening night) I was really underwhelmed. Nothing in the movie seemed to make sense, because there was so much in it. I went to a second viewing for the film and found myself pleasantly surprised by how much I loved it. It is a really well directed, written, and acted film. Many people hate on it because they cant follow it and find small things to complain about, but if you actually pay attention to the film, you see they explain things. a common complaint was ""why did Harry know to crawl to the goblin suit and know it would heal him"" wwell if you paid attention you will have seen he observed the suit in a earlier scene that explained everything about it. So stop trying to find things to hate. This movie is fantastic and I believe it is the best Spider-Man film to date. And the best incarnation of Spider-Man on film. The cast is really spectacular especially Andrew Garfield and Dane DeHaan. So do yourselves a favor and ignore the critics. you'll have a blast. I love this movie."
"raulfaust","8","16","26","12 September 2014"," Friends and rivals?
","I had high expectations for this picture due to two main reasons. First: I really loved the first Webb's vision on Spider-Man. Second: Many people told me good about it-- albeit some others said the contrary. Anyways, I feel very sincere to say that it almost corresponded to my hopes. The first hour of this film is extremely entertaining, containing lots of action, drama and even humor, each one in its own way. The scene in which our hero takes the pants off of a criminal is really unexpected, reason why I instantly laughed. The relationship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn is just as great as I could've expected. They play that classic game in which initially they seem to like each other, but, in some other times, they feel like enemies. Acting from Emma Stone is GREAT, like in the previous installment. Director has so much faith in her that basically all the emotive sentences come from her character-- which in fact touched me, mainly if considering I'm about to graduate. Besides, I feel very satisfied that a Spider-Man movie FINALLY decided to explain the issue involving Peter's parents; I mean, for those-- like me-- who have never read the cartoons, their situation was an absolute abyss. Also, I enjoyed the joke involving ""Jaws"" and I had a spontaneous laugh in that scene. Photography directing and special effects are beautifully AWESOME. Other than that, I kind of agree with those who complained about the plot, since it felt rushed for some moments, but it doesn't the spoil the movie's overall qualities. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", even if not as great as the previous version, obviously, is a movie that I respect and recommend to anyone who enjoys this superhero. Thumbs up!"
"martinrobertson300482","6","89","179","30 April 2014"," Spends most of its time setting up future movies ...
","""The Amazing Spider-man 2"" is a tough one. A Movie I can't actually figure out whether I liked or not. Parts of it were actually amazing. While other parts were far from it.<br/><br/>I Think the main problem with this second Spider-man movie (Or is it fifth Spider-man movie?) is that the film before it still feels like a re-run. Yes, as good as ""The Amazing Spider-man"" was. It still felt over-shadowed by three previous movies that didn't really deserve to get ignored. I left that one thinking ""Oh well, at least they've got the setting up out of the way, and can get on with doing something different in the next one."" Trouble is, they haven't. This one also spends most of its time setting up future movies. While other parts bring nothing new and feel like more repeats. I mean, wasn't that ""Washing machine"" gag done in the other ""Spider-man 2?"" <br/><br/>The biggest mistake ""The Amazing Spider-man 2"" makes though. Is one that this series should already have learnt not to do. And that's under-using its villain. The main bad guy off this one is suppose to be Electro. A Bad-guy that was always going to be a tough sell, and they don't quite manage it. In the Cartoons he looks so ridiculous that they've had to entirely redesign him, which is cool. But the character is ruined after an amazing intro by being under-used yet over done.<br/><br/>The ""Real"" main villain of the movie is Harry Osborne (Dane DeHann) and although this is one of the things that has been done before, he is arguably the best thing in the movie. The minute DeHann was cast I knew he would be great, and he is. His ""dual identity"" too, has been redesigned, but for the better. With a new take, that makes the future of the series at least look promising.<br/><br/>But what about this movie? It likes building up future ideas, but there must be something else good about it by itself? Well, Andrew Garfield is still pleasing fans as Spider-man, and his chemistry with Emma Stone is still strong. Providing the movie with most of its laughs, charm, and in some parts, genuine tears. But we watch Spider-man for the action, right? And most of the action too, is still cool. Even if the series has far from reinvented itself, and is still spending a bit too much time on Spider-man's love life, than his crime fighting."
"xscd","9","17","28","11 September 2014"," Better and more entertaining than the previous Spider-Man Movies
","One of the harshest critics of this movie said that ""nearly everything exists only to advance the plot."" I found myself wondering what he thinks should have filled that time instead. The movie did cover a lot of territory, so it was necessary to spend less time on some things than others in order not to be overly long.<br/><br/>I found this movie immensely entertaining and often truly humorous, especially Peter Parker's dialog which was in my opinion very well written and well acted.<br/><br/>I feel that only the most jaded and demanding of critics would be hard on this movie, and only because virtually nothing would be good enough for their personal standards of perfection. For everyone else, this is a very good movie, my favorite so far of the Spider-Man movies."
"jakeanderson1206","4","27","48","15 August 2014"," Not perfect, but doesn't deserve the sheer amount of hatred
","Alright, I know I'm not the populist opinion here, so I'll go ahead and say what I think and try to articulate why I think this movie is probably the best Spider-man movie to date.<br/><br/>First off, I don't like the Raimi films, I tried my absolute best to tolerate the ridiculous cheese, underacting (McGuire and Dunst) and overacting (Pretty much everyone else) the hoaky writing, the plot holes, the weird character motivations, but I couldn't. I feel that everyone who compares the new Amazing flicks to the Raimi trilogy misses the point of a reboot, its not supposed to be like the old movies, that's the idea.<br/><br/>First off, its undeniable that Garfield far outshines McGuire as an actor, and as Spider-man. Not only that, but even without the comparison, he manages to play a likable and natural High-Schooler (Despite the fact that he looks like he's in college) Emma Stone, well, she almost makes the movie. Marc Webb can definitely write chemistry between characters well, and with Gwen and Peter, it really shines. I genuinely cared about the romance in both movies, which I could not say for the old films. <br/><br/>The other actors are all solid, Jamie Foxx is a great actor, and while his part is not original, it is entertaining and well acted. Props also to Dane Dehaan, who is a great actor and a fantastic Harry Osbourne. <br/><br/>Is this movie the mess of a plot everyone says it is? Not really. I was never confused or befuddled by the absurdity of the plot or situation at hand. However, the only thing I can honestly fault on the film can be Sony's marketing. Putting the Rhino in the trailers was idiotic considering he's in two scenes, and yes, the film feels like its fulfilling a quota of things to do with its plot, but here's the catch: its entertaining. The characters are fun to watch, the story keeps true to the Ultimate Spiderman mythos, and it genuinely makes you care for everyone you are supposed to care for. This, in my opinion is the best Spiderman movie we've had, its enjoyable, exciting, heartfelt, and a very well-written film, but Sony's meddling is very evident."
"bastiantaibo","5","76","154","20 April 2014"," A waste of an actor born to play Spidey
","I'm a big fan of comics, particularly Marvel's characters and I grew up adoring Spiderman and most of the adaptations that have been made. The 90s animated series ruled, the Raimi trilogy made true the dream of a real action movie of the webhead but threw it all away in the final installment and this franchise..... just doesn't feel right to me.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with Amazing Spiderman both 1 and 2 is that the writers seem to misinterpret the aspects of the hero and it's surroundings. Spidey comes out more silly and clowny than witty and sarcastic. He is annoying to the guys he's fighting like a mime can be annoying when you walk by him in the sidewalk and chooses to displayed all his talents for you to see, and that's just not the feeling I think this character should provoke. All that, added to the crowds cheering behind a police line while Spidey fights a villain makes it all too childish for my taste.<br/><br/>What's really sad is that Andrew Garfield is the best Spiderman there is and will be. He has embodied the character amazingly and any shortcomings are due to the screenplay he's has to work with. Same goes to Emma Stone, a brilliant young actress that has returned dignity to our beloved Gwen Stacy after what Spiderman 3 did to her. Them and the greatly accomplished CGI scenes of Spidey's web swinging, which are what I've always thought that these scenes should look like, are the beautiful things about this movie that end up wasted in a context that doesn't do justice to a wonderful character and it's even more wonderful universe."
"firelazz","9","115","242","15 April 2014"," The best adaption until now!
","The story, for a superhero movie, was well written, logical and just very good. A bigger universe is definitely created and I can not wait for the future. The movie was 150min but it didn't feel long at all. Because of good pacing and very good acting. The relationships that all the characters have in one way or another on screen was magnificent. (Not only Peter and Gwen but also props to Dane Dehaan as Goblin and Jamie Fox as Electro!! .... Each scene with them was a wow moment) If I only could see part 3 now. <br/><br/>The action was a huge step up. This is how I want my comic book heroes to see on the silver screen. Nothing more to say about this part. Well crafted out, epic-moments and emotional moments. <br/><br/>I saw it in 3D (only way for this avant-premiere) and the 3D was thanks to the 3D EPIC RED cameras full of depth. It felt natural and after a while you'll forget you have glasses on. It was very immersive and really added a new dimension! Occasionally they used also pop-out 3D. <br/><br/>Summary: Big step forward for this Spidey universe. In my opinion best adaption of the comic-book hero."
"Nebzyl","7","34","64","3 August 2014"," Best version of Spiderman till date...
","The original trilogy seemed incomplete but now, that incompleteness is completed by this new one. I love the background story of Spiderman shown in this movie, at least it has got one unlike the original. The story of how Peter Parker ended up with his Uncle and Aunt, the story of why ""Peter Parker"" is the only one who could be Spiderman and no-one else. It all feels complete now. A satisfactory plot for a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Talking about the performances, I like the new Peter Parker, humorous and entertainer. I've started to feel the original 'Peter Parker' was actually boring. Really good job by the actors here. And with that SuperVillian : 'Electro', the movie becomes one of the best SuperHero movies. Visual effects are quite good and the movie is perfectly entertaining. For me, this is the best version of Spiderman movie till now.

"rjsf96","4","148","320","22 April 2014"," Spidey Swings into Action
","Spider-Man's film franchise has always been a bumpy road with Sony Pictures. The Sam Raimi trilogy for the most part revitalised the Superhero genre that was stuck in the mud with the abysmal Batman and Robin. The first Spidey outing changed the genre around and managed to get fans interested in the characters and the storyline once again. The sequel improved with a more complex villain and better character development. However, fans lost faith with the threequel and Spidey's future was stuck to one huge tangle of a web.<br/><br/>Then along came Marc Webb, with The Amazing Spider-Man which was shrugged off by the critics and called a cash grab. However, whatever criticisms there have been of the previous four films this one seems devoid of all of them and gives fans what they have longed for; an exciting, mesmerising and pulse- pounding adventure one that stays true to the comics.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a jam packed film and every shot has been thoroughly examined and expertly directed by Marc Webb. The effects are the best that they have ever looked, the characters are fully developed and we care more than we ever have done about them all and the action and story threads are not all over the place. The beauty of TASM 2 lies in the fact that the origins of Spidey have been set up and he is free to roam this spectacularly created world.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that there has not been much hype surrounding this superhero sequel and going in with high but not extreme expectations it blew them out of the park so effortlessly I was left gob-smacked. This leaves us with undoubtedly a Superhero for the ages and the best outing for any standalone character since The Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>The score composed by Hans Zimmer shows off his mastery of the Superhero genre of music and his themes for Spidey, Electro and Goblin are always enthralling and only add to the burst of colour and energy that we receive on screen. Here's to hoping he can stay on as he proves himself a worthy heir to Danny Elfman's Spidey scores.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the story threads are balanced with ease and that is not a small task to be had. There are three villains; Electro, the Green Goblin and the Rhino. The rhino played with a maniac twist by Paul Giamatti relishes the short screen time he gets and leaves us longing for more (which will come with TASM 3). The goblin (Dane DeHaan) gives a better performance than the campy version we got with Willem Dafoe in 2002. He brings menace and I was shaken up when we hear his manic cackle from afar off screen. His relationship with Peter is explored and his origin story is told well and most importantly of all his character motivations makes sense. Electro (Jamie Foxx) gives a career changing performance and matches if not exceeding Doc Ock in 2004. He is similar to this character as he is more of a tragic villain, striving to be noticed and changing by a terrible accident into the deformed and terrifying Electro. He changes so drastically throughout the film's runtime it leaves us with a Spidey villain for the ages.<br/><br/>Gwen and Peter's relationship is given plenty of depth and is not (thankfully) lost in the plethora of set pieces and action scenes that frequently take place. The struggle of Peter's double life gives us many twists and turns. Andrew Garfield (who is by far the greatest Spidey and Peter Parker) and Emma Stone light up the screen with their meaningful and charismatic chemistry ensuring that sometimes two people talking can be just as exciting as watching the action unfold.<br/><br/>The final end scene is heartfelt, surely bringing a tear to even the most cold-hearted of people and will definitely leave viewers overwhelmed by the direction this sequel takes, yet it is never clichÃ©d, boring or predictable.<br/><br/>This is a smart film and should be the template for Superhero sequels to follow in many years to come; it is a game changer one that breaks the mould and sets the bar as high as Spidey's web can reach. Webb will need to be on top form to exceed this rare thing; a Superhero Masterpiece."

However,this time I was surprisingly shocked to see how much it stepped up, it was better than any Spider-Man movie I ever watched. <br/><br/>I first need to say that the director did a great job in twisting the plot and changing it to fool us a big time, I will not spoil the movie. Also the acting was phenomenal, the villains were right on track, and speaking of tracks the soundtrack was a killer, this Johann Strauss II is a genius, adding futuristic sounds to comprehend the sound of electricity, with his music you can actually cry to dubstep."

","The are many bad things in this world, and one of them is those occasions in which we find somebody or something saying/doing a lot but really not saying/doing anything at all â€“ Marc Webb's follow up to his surprisingly great popcorn adventure from 2012 is sadly one of those such occasions. Upon conclusion of this 130 minute plus blast of hot air it becomes clear that the hope we had with the reboot of an already new franchise is now sadly hanging in the balance of movie purgatory, a place that is neither here nor there and a place where we the audience now will find it hard to care what else this franchise has to offer.<br/><br/>Webb's 2012 film benefited greatly from a fresh sense of direction that Webb harnessed to great use in his breakout movie 500 Days of Summer, but here just a few years on the direction and pace of this ""amazing"" adventure feels well and truly drained of its power. As mentioned in the opening the film exists to cover ground that has been covered before and makes this venture seriously hard to warm to when so many words and scenarios are playing out for playing-out's sake. With Webb's direction feeling now lacklustre the bad mojo spreads to his cast in particular Andrew Garfield who gets lost in a movie that his natural charm can't escape from, his Spider-Man and Peter Parker that showed youthful enthusiasm in the first is here nothing more than a wisecracking, sulky mess that makes you wonder if we should actually even like him, although the story Garfield has been placed in is so overplayed now over all these incarnations that it could just be fatigue from over familiarity that even the introduction of two new villains cant solve.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx coming off his most beloved film Django Unchained was a hot casting choice as the sorry and powerful Electro while Dane DeHaan so good in Chronicle and The Place Beyond the Pines was also a score for the movie's casting, but both man sadly don't get much shift with a particular wasting of Foxx. Foxx's dweebish Max Dillon is neither scary or human enough to be memorable and he does overplay the outsider nature of the character to unbelievable levels, while DeHaan has small moments, his Harry Osborn is perhaps being saved for later entries to shine truly. The ensemble as a whole here feels weak which is a shame, an indictment backed up the fact Paul Giamatti who appears for 5 or so minutes seems far more interesting.<br/><br/>Without a real stand-out action piece, and with far too much exposition that has been covered before this Amazing movie feels anything but. For a film with a $200 million budget and with talent in all departments it's a real shame that it turned out to be the movie that it is, although with 5 separate Spider-Man films now done and dusted, one must wonder if there is anything that could make this blockbuster staple truly jaw dropping again.<br/><br/>This particular reviewer would be leaning towards the answer of highly doubtful.<br/><br/>2 mid air data transfers out of 5<br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out -<br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"chris_mcsweeney","5","55","111","17 April 2014"," Cartoonish and flat. The bad writing disembowels it completely.
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the unwarranted and unnecessary sequel to 2012's equally unnecessary and unwarranted The Amazing Spider-Man. It almost goes without saying that this is a staggeringly transparent cash- grab on the part of Sony and to a lesser extent Marvel, but the question is, is it worth your time and money?<br/><br/>The short answer is, absolutely not. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 evokes unavoidable comparisons to the masterstroke of the 2002-2007 trilogy, Spiderman 2, which was unquestionably superior in literally every conceivable fashion. As a matter-of-fact, you'll often wish â€“ during TASM2's 140 minute runtime â€“ that you're watching Spiderman 2. But how can that be? As Buzzfeed like to remind us, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are delightful; Dane De Haan is a promising young actor with a striking resemblance to a young Leonardo Di Caprio and Jamie Foxx is an experienced actor playing a potentially strong villain. Behind the camera, director Marc Webb impressed everybody with (500) Days of Summer and a string of well-known music videos, so what could go wrong? The answer, as is often the case in failed blockbusters, is lazy, shitty writing. It will be of no surprise to anyone that screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have each had a hand in at least one Transformers movie. But I digress.<br/><br/>TASM2, much like its predecessor, tediously and uncharismatically explores the mystery of what happened to Peter's parents, while Peter himself unconvincingly gets adjusted to his new life as Spiderman. Typically, there is also an antagonist who pops out of the woodwork courtesy of Oscorp (which surely by now should've faced at least some legal scrutiny for becoming a world-leader in the manufacture of supervillains), and Harry Osborn also appears as the harbinger of an inevitable Green Goblin return. This much has surely been made obvious by the trailer.<br/><br/>While this movie has some legitimately impressive action set-pieces, it succeeds only in turning a respectable group of lead actors into scenery-chewing, Saturday-morning-cartoon caricatures. During the film's non-action scenes, the leads unforgivably adopt ham-fisted pseudo- representations of their real-life personalities - I'm referring in mainly to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone here. It becomes insipidly clear as the film goes on that their off-screen personality as a ""cute celebrity couple"" has been allowed to directly influence the writing. Often it feels as if they've just been thrown into a scene and told to improvise, and riff off of their natural chemistry. This is cute to watch, but when you suddenly remember that the last scene finished with an argument (or even an official break up at one point) it does make you question how well the writers knew their own screenplay. They chuckle and fawn giddily over each other, in spite of the fact that the narrative demands that they behave otherwise â€“ like real human people would.<br/><br/>Poorly written scenes are not in short supply, and they encapsulate the knuckle-bitingly poor dialogue that mutilates this movie from beginning to end. The dialogue in the original trilogy was far from Shakespeare, but it was firm, utilitarian dialogue that moved the plot along. Here, everything is awkward and confused. It also through this poor scripting and story-telling that it becomes unescapable to realise Peter is in fact, quite obnoxious and douchey in this incarnation of Spiderman. Look at the plot from the villains' point of view as the film goes along, and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Ultimately, TASM2 just left me feeling quite sad. The writers' tendency to open up plot holes the size of craters, and the bizarre shift toward Adam West Batman-style ""campy"" villains just made everyone seem like a dick who wasn't worth rooting for. By rebooting the Spiderman franchise this early â€“ and getting a great cast to boot â€“ Sony have made the unspoken promise that they've corrected the mistakes that the original trilogy made, and even improved upon its positives. However, they have achieved neither. This series has thus far done everything that the original series did, but slightly worse. Anything new it's tried to do, it has done poorly, and frankly I feel like a sucker for going to see it.<br/><br/>BUT HEY, THEY'RE MAKING A THIRD ONE WITH DOC OCK AND VULTURE AND OTHERS. GET OUT YOUR WALLETS."

"itsjoshykho","5","39","79","25 April 2014"," Pacing Issues, Unbalanced and off.
","I went into this film with high expectations. I enjoyed the first one more than I thought I would have, as well as the trailers for this movie really had my attention going. Sadly, this movie is no where near as good as the first film and felt like it was directed by someone completely different.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film is the pacing. Something about the flow of the movie was just wrong and off. Some scenes went on for way too long, I'm talking about 20 minutes of just straight up chatter of non related topics that do not contribute to the film's storyline at all. The next scene would then be a 30 second clip of something interesting, and then it would cut back to scenes that actually bored me. Even the action scenes were paced so poorly. I can't find the exact word for it, but the only word I can think of is weird when it comes to the action. Don't get me wrong, the visual effects look great and the cinematography is great also (way more colorful and bright than the first film) but nothing in the action feels natural. I was never on the edge of my seat on any of the action sequences. Even the last action that was supposed to be the final climax action set piece had me feeling empty. The structure of this movie was just messy and all over the place, and on some parts, very boring to watch.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield I felt was not as strong in this film as he was in the first film. Its not so much his acting, but the script he was given. All he does is cry or look like he's about to cry, and the dialog scenes that he has with anyone (even Gwen) is super dooper cheesy and un-natural. Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborne was good, but not as spectacular as everyone says he is. He was particularly strong towards the final act of the film. Jamie Foxx was a weird one for me. I couldn't tell if his acting was poor, or if what he was told to do was poor. Before he became Electro, his scenes were off as hell. Too rushed, too many quick cuts and just unbalanced (which as I said before is pretty much the entire film). The reason of why he suddenly becomes a villain I found was just stupid. One second he's totally obsessed with spider-man and the next he wants to kill him... Ummmm...huh? One of the few things that was good about Electro (or Max Dillon) is that you sympathise for him at first and you feel sorry for him because he gets treated like horse crap. But all that connection is lost as soon as the times square showdown sequence happens. The best performance is still Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy). She's always good, but as I said before, the dialog in this movie is off, which does affect her performance on a small scale. <br/><br/>Another big thing that ruined the movie for me was the music. The trailers made it seem like this truly was spider-man's ultimate battle because of the music (especially the music towards the end of the final trailer). What do we get instead? Dubstep, party music (Project X stuff) and music that seems like it would belong on the Disney channel. Whenever there's an action sequence, the music completely ruins the tone of the fight making it so much more less intense than it should have been. And since Hans Zimmer was composing the score, I expected it to be intense orchestral hybrid pieces. If he were to compose a score that would sound something like inception's, then I could see that capturing the tone of the film (particularly the action sequences). <br/><br/>A few things I actually like about the film: The opening scene was amazing. I thought that by watching the opening scene, this movie would top all of the other Spiderman movies. Sadly I was wrong. The action as I said before is cool to watch. Everything is very colorful, and the visual effects aren't the realistic type in lets just say Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Man of Steel. Its the cartoony comic book style type of visual effects (sort of like 300's) which is great for this type of movie. I also like how they don't over do the slow motion in the movie. It was used when it was needed the most and it looked great. <br/><br/>All and all, this film felt like it was directed by Michael Bay. It had that weird, off, quick cut, rushed, forced and messy pace but had great visual effects just like Transformers 2 and 3. This isn't a terrible film, but its not good either. If you want to watch this movie for the action, then you're in for a treat. However, you will need to get through the clunky dialog, bad pacing, okay acting, rushed villain origin stories and a generic storyline. In total, there is probably only around 30-40 minutes of action which means you will need to get through the 90 to 100 minutes of everything else.<br/><br/>5/10 - Mediocre"
"DUKEJBM","Null","31","61","2 May 2014"," So bad.... actually offended by how bad this turned out.
","Based on the fact that I did not enjoy the first movie, I lowered my expectations yet still tried to judge this film on its own merit. Even so, I have to classify this effort as an absolute film travesty. It is all kinds of awful.<br/><br/>I seriously am searching for something to like and I do absolutely love the character. Spidey looks great and I really do like the cast. It's too bad they gave them such a dumb story and such a bad script to shoot. There are so many things wrong with this effort that it's tough to sum up my utter contempt for what I saw unfold on screen. What struck me about an hour and a half in to the run time was the fact that nothing major was happening yet they managed to develop NOT one single character. Everything feels shallow and most nothing connects. They book end the film with cheesy Rhino moments that really deserve all the ""Batman & Robin"" comparisons that I've read. (Spider-Man messing around in the opening truck chase should have gotten dozens of people killed for no reason) Seeing New Yorkers standing behind instant barricades watching gun battles and explosions happening less than 100 yards away as if it was some sort of Spider-Man sports contest actually made me cringe. That happens three times during the film. Electro was ridiculous and again, the parallels to the worst films the genre has ever produced are real and tangible. Harry Osborn is yet another wasted and unbelievable cheesy character.<br/><br/>I do award a few salvation points for actually giving Aunt May a few scenes to shine (unlike the first film.) The action is completely forgettable except for the final Goblin showdown. That was well done (more salvation points). The slo-mo vibe is terrible and the soundtrack severely detracts from everything. The dialogue is as bad as it gets as is EVERYONE'S motivation.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm a Marvel fan that is actually offended by how bad this turned out."

"RforFilm","4","47","98","2 May 2014"," The crowded story in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 shoots an unfocused mess of cobwebs.
","The modern summertime at the movies has developed a tradition where a superhero movie or two is released that can please both a general audience looking to be lost in a fantasy and a comic book crowd that's counting to see if everything is properly represented. Before the 2000's, most of these adaptations took two different paths that separated these crowds; either something that's more playful with bright colors like Superman and the original Spider-Man that's self aware that it's campy and silly. And there's the dark and dramatic route that Batman and The Crow took with an atmosphere that's cold but stylish, and bolder character development.<br/><br/>Most superhero movies today tend to go with the latter. The idea behind this is that with every caped crusader, there has to be some big epic story with how they got there and the dilemma they must be going through, doing their typical ""saving the day"" routine. The previous Spider- Man trilogy had more of a campy route with occasional scenes of dramatic character arcs. The recent reboot of The Amazing Spider-Man gave our friendly neighborhood hero a reimagining that was darker, but still the same wisecracker we loved. It took me by surprise, so it made sense that I was hyped to see where the story would go in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>So what's going on? The real question is, ""What's not going on?"" as the movie tries to put a lot into it's story. Peter Parker (played by Andrew Garfield) has settled into his role as New York's favorite son as he catches thieves, thwarts dangers, and saves an occasional life, including that of an electrical engineer Max Dillon (played by Jamie Fox). What Spider-Man didn't know was that Max was a big fan of the Web Slinger, and dreams of being just as important and wanted.<br/><br/>An accident with electric eels causes Max to mutate into a living electric generator. His debut is met with disgust and horror. In a spectacular action sequence, Max calls himself Electro and starts to destroy Time's Square, finally releasing his personal anger with the world. You would think that Spider-Man would have enough trouble with this guy, but Peter also has to deal with discovering that his father may have been hiding top secret research work from evil, his best friend Harry Osborn (played by Dane DeHaan) returning to take over his dad's company, a relationship with Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone), and even the beginning of submitting photos for The Daily Bugle newspaper.<br/><br/>There's a lot more plot to tell, but I don't want to lose focus. That's the biggest problem with The Amazing Spider-Man 2; it tries to tell a lot of story. Since they got the origin story out of the way in the previous film, I thought that this movie would be ready to give us something that was different from the previous trilogy. In truth, I found myself making a lot of comparisons to the okay-received Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>It shares the same problem of adding in too many villains and rushing most of the development in place for uninteresting story and jokes. I can only blame the less then average screenplay, as the acting here is really good. The material with Electro, with his back-story and the battle sequences, was so good that I don't know why they simply didn't settle on that for a movie. There's nothing wrong with a superhero film that's only ninety minutes long. I can tell that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a result of a director's vision clashing with Sony's corporate idea of setting up a franchise. It never meshes enough for a solid story.<br/><br/>I'll give this four comic book electros out of ten. This movie has impressive acting, impressive visuals, and impressive cinematography, but it's badly put together story lacks true excitement that I got from the previous franchise. Ughit was close."

","Wow, that was really bad. I didn't want to hate this movie because I am a huge spider man fan, but this...My God it was horrific. It seriously, seriously sucks. I don't even know where to begin. First of all the characters: First of all, the characters are annoying and crap. As much as I like Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, their characters were absolutely awful. Gwen is almost a nothing character and the writers obviously don't get her character. And don't even get me started on Peter. He is an annoying, unlikable, smug idiot who is so far from the spider man in the comics it is shocking. As for the villains: RUBBISH. Dane DeHaan and Jamie Foxx deliver good performances, but their characters are underused, worthless and hardly anything they do makes the slightest lick of sense. The friendship between Peter and Harry is also so painfully underdeveloped and just makes me not care about Harry as a character. What also annoys me is that the movie is basically just a 2 hour advertisement for the next movie. No joke. Also, while the action sequences look impressive, I don't really care, as all the action that was in the movie was all in the trailers anyway. No joke. I am honestly enraged that I paid money to see this movie, only to be met with basically a 2 hour advertisement for the next movie, which I am not going to see after this travesty by the way. Very, very rarely does a movie make me feel angry, but this one ticks all the boxes. Almost no plot, illogical plot holes, crap characters, awful CGI, boring story (Wait, was there even a story?) way too much action and a waste of good actors. But what really sealed my utter disgust and hatred for this movie was the ending. That ending might as well have been Mark Webb sticking his middle finger up to the audience, because it was basically him saying ""OK, I know you have all had to sit through 2 hours of crap, so here is 2 iconic comic book scenes that we have shoved into the movie at the last minute and then resolved just as quickly to appease fan boys. Happy now?"" It enrages me that Mark Webb actually had the utter gall to do that. As for the Rhino: Shoehorned into the movie for no reason other than to sell toys. That's it. That's all I'm going to say. The amazing spider man 2 is one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with Batman and Robin and Catwoman as one of the worst comic book movies of all time. And I say that without hyperbole. To any one who actually wants a plot in a movie, do NOT watch this. AVOID!!! Without question, avoid this movie. 1/10."

"starcrowq3","7","4","5","16 November 2018"," Nice visuals, a great soundtrack and a solid Spider-Man movie!
","Since this movie was released I've seen it a couple of times. And I always come to the same conclusion, this wasent bad at all.
Garfield does a solid Spider-Man. It's not the same ""nerdish and a little shy like"" version as Tobey Maguire did, but instead it's a more straight forward Spider-Man/Peter Parker that feels a bit more modern at times. The old trilogy is classics already by all means, but this one felt more visual pleasing somehow.
The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone is still there. Sure the story of one of the bad guys played by Jaime Foxx felt a bit too much to maybe make me sympathize with him turning over to the darkside. But then again with great powers comes maybe too much responsibility for some right? Some people just can't handle the power. We can still understand his motives so it doesnt take much away from the action. And this movie felt really great when it comes to visally upgrading the action scenes, making spidey more visually stunning with it's more colorfull visuals then maybe ever before.
I also think Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn felt alot better then the original trilogys version that felt flat and childish. This one had depth and his own motives and struggles.
The soundtrack is another great one from Hanz Zimmer that adds another level of the emotions felt by the characters and the scenes.
All in all i think this one did alot better then people give it credit for. And it feels like a missed oppertunity not making a 3rd one. They had alot of potential moving forward from this one, without going into spoilers. Instead we ended up with a new Spidey that doesn't do it bad either but feels a bit too childish for my taste. This one felt more like a middleground suited for all ages, like it should be."

At least, Raimi's trilogy had some New York aerial shots. In this movie, almost everything is CGI. The fights are good, but, too short. And,in some shots, the CGI looks extremely FAKE. It's good, but not that good. It's not epic, and it's absolutely forgettable. Yes, I admit it take my breath in some shots. I'm not saying that Raimi's trilogy it's best, but the every fight with Dr. Octopus is Spider-man 2 it's just... epic. I like the visual style of Marc Webb, it's like a comic book.

I am concerned that SONY Pictures is planning two more after this sequel.<br/><br/>With so much talent out there, why do they have to pick such an amateur bunch of bad actors? So many good stories out there to tell, and SONY picks this stupid script to waste money in the name of collecting revenue. The whole movie is too violent for not reason, and the plot is so silly that my 11 year old daughter asked me to leave in the middle of the movie. The whole cast is boring and Jamie J. Fox is so stupid that sometimes you wonder ... We couldn't finish the movie, we left after the first 30 minutes. Please don't waste your time and money on this movie, instead bring your children to watch ""Bears"" from Disney, or any other instructive and educative movie.<br/><br/>We need to start sending the right message to Hollywood, we are not consuming movies for the sake of consuming movies, we go to the movies to learn and enjoy a good story and have a good time. SONY should learn from good movies like ""Captain America"".<br/><br/>My two cents,"

","After being dragged to the movies i found myself in the Theater watching Spider Man. Coming in to it I was hesitant mostly for the unnecessary reboot of the whole thing.<br/><br/>I found spider man for lack of better wording ""a sack of bore"" Jamie Foxx's character was poorly portrayed though I'm not sure whether it was his acting or scripting. He was supposed to play this invisible quite dorky guy with the worse comb over. Yet you feel no sympathy or anything for him, he's dull really.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx's character wasn't even fully developed as a person before he all of a sudden became this blue thing out of nowhere. Emma Stone was probably my favorite but her and Spiderman in my eyes had zero chemistry and the part where she dies at the end... no where near as heart felt or moving as it could have been. <br/><br/>All in all, a really bad remake."

","I'm sorry but this film left me wanting so much more.<br/><br/>The action was good but limited. The story interesting but lacking. All in all its another superhero film that leaves me stating that Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy is by far the best in superhero films ever.<br/><br/>But the good stuff. Graphics and CGI were brilliantly done, the soundtrack is amazing and the acting superb, well bar Jamie Foxxs over acting the bumbling idiot the attention seeking fool, Sorry Jamie but you've done better.<br/><br/>Is it the worst superhero film ever. Well no cause we were given the green lantern but it just didn't hit the right note for me at all.<br/><br/>Better luck with number 3 but definitely keep Andrew Garfield in the role as does an amazing job."

","Aside from the Emma Stone, Sally Field, and the Spiderman side of Garfield's role, the acting was pretty terrible all around. The film in general bases itself around a horrible plot that manages to do a worse job with the villains than the 1st series.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx's role as Electro was performed adequately at best with the badly written script he was given. The performance of DeHaan as Harry Osborn was atrocious at best. The Actor seemed to be in a rage induced stupor the entire movie, leaving little room to promote his back story with Parker The Green Goblin on the other hand.. Somehow they have managed to destroy the character more thoroughly than the 1st series ever has. Poor acting and horrific costume design make the character more of a laughing stock than the James Franco version at the beginning of Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>Aside from the above average visual effects, and timely one-liners of Garfield's Spiderman persona.. This movie will leave you wanting your time and money back."
"The_moan_of_all_moans","4","33","68","24 April 2014"," Web of woeful.
","Let me start by saying that 30 minutes into this film i was just about to get up, casually walk down the stairs in the aisle, leave and go do something better with my time. The so called comedy that Spiderman so infuriatingly tries to convey is embarrassing. How can you expect the viewer to take any villain as a threat when all this pubescent dweeb does is make horrible, i repeat horrible, ""jokes"" in the middle of fight scenes. It really is a mystery to me. And i know that it is trying to stay true to the comic, where little spidey will ""say something funny"" in the midst of battle, but there are things from the comic that shouldn't be incorporated into the movie because it doesn't come across comical. Instead it makes it excruciating to watch. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is terrible as Spiderman; absolutely terrible. Is it his fault his dialogue and direction is detestable? Probably not, but his clear inability to execute them is. I do not rate him as an actor at all. And whilst he is dragging the film down Dane Dehaan is the small glimpse of hope to the film. He shows grit in his role as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. It is his performance alongside the excellent action scenes that make this film watchable in my opinion. <br/><br/>Spiderman, undoubtedly has massive potential, but instead of capitalizing on it, Mark Webb (the irony kills me) has instead decided to cash in on a rising trend in films. I'll call it ""The Twilight Trend"". Films focused solely on attracting teenagers. First was ""Twilight"", showing how NOT to do a film about Vampires and Werewolves. Then came ""Hunger Games""; which was a little baby version of ""Battle Royale"". Then came ""The Host"" which gave all the gullible, love seeking teenagers a movie about an Invasion of Aliens. Next it was ""Divergent"" which is an abysmal version of ""Equilibrium"". You'll notice that all these are based on books. And it has (in different masses) had droves of teenagers flood to see them, become infatuated with them, obsess over them. Spiderman reminded me of all those films. It was cheesy like them, it was soul-less like them, it was a watered down version of what it should be. All about a love story and nothing about an impending threat to the World. <br/><br/>As i said the action scenes where phenomenal; great to see. But every now and then this nerdy voice would spit out a sarcastic slur, and in an instant i would be unhooked. The potential for Spiderman is limitless and no doubt when it has run its course of pleasing little screaming teenagers, it will reboot. And i can only hope, that next time around they take it seriously and maybe bump it up to a 15 certificate, which would give more room for conviction. <br/><br/>4/10 for action scenes and Dane Dehaan."

","I am writing this as a Spidey fan and I am really really disappointed by the film. I did have some expectations because of the actors and crew involved, especially Hans Zimmer. Some people guessed from the first trailer that the film was gonna suck and they were right. It was a very bombastic, silly, unentertaining film. The good things I remember from the film are only Emma Stone's smile and Hans Zimmer's dub-step+rap Electro theme. <br/><br/>Film starts with a totally unnecessary scene in a plane where Peter's parents try to survive an assassination attempt which is really silly. Plotwise it doesn't build anything up,doesn't explain anything. Just a scene stolen from the Dark Knight Rises. As we get back to present day story, we see Peter Parker being the same idiotic, smug and megalomaniac character. Normally you would expect a hero to make sacrifices for the people, especially the downtrodden. But in this film Spiderman is just a prick who makes some gimmicks for the applause. Then there is a messy over the top car chase scene. That whole fight on the truck between Peter and Russian guy was boring and stupid.<br/><br/>Later they set the relation between Peter and Harry.In 5 minutes they became the best friends they were years ago which is unbelievable. As for Max Dillon, he is simply uninteresting nerd archetype. One could expect a King Kong alegory but for that writers and director are too incompetent. Max turns from that passive nerdy guy to a totally nihilistic person who wants everyone to suffer. Transformation is implausible. <br/><br/>Harry is even worse. There is no depth at all in his character. All the depth is spewed from his mouth in the scene with his dying father. He unbelievably knocks out two security guards in Ravencroft and then successfully infiltrates the facility and reaches the most protected room in the building. All this is done by the son of a multi- billionaire! After he becomes goblin, he seems to manage to easily learn how glider works and all the martial arts thing to tackle with Spiderman! By the way, why he chose the goblin suit is never explained. Vulture, Octopus suits were also there. Wouldn't it be funny if he chose Octopus suit? By the way why does Oscorp develop those suits? It has no meaning. In Raimi film, the Goblin suit was a military research. In this film, it rather seems that Norman Osborn is a crazy evil scientist who just loves killing people using advanced technology. <br/><br/>Meanwhile big secret of Peter's father is revealed which is not really a big deal and as a plot point not rewarding. It is very typical and film would be better if there were no secret at all. Then there are another questions. Why did Electro and Harry attack Spiderman separately? Why couldn't Electro escape Ravencroft on his own? How did Harry know that Electro hates Spiderman? How did Gwen steal a police car? Why didn't police show up near power plant when Spiderman and Electro were fighting? Why didn't Gwen bleed when she hit her head onto the floor?<br/><br/>Having suffered two terrible Spiderman films, I hope Sam Raimi comes back. But it will never happen. Webb has a contract for another Spiderman film. This time it will be even worse with that stupid rhino mech, Vulture and Dr. Octopus suits. They all look ridiculous and producers will turn Dr. Octopus into a random criminal. Why does Sony suck so much at making this series work? Could not they see Marvel and how it treats its own characters?"
"sheance114","Null","33","69","29 April 2014"," It's Spider-man 3 once again, but this time more terrible
","EXTREME SPOILER ALERT! I've warned you.<br/><br/>Remember the time when Spider-man was cool and awesome? Remember the time when the story was so strong, it made you cringe? Remember the time when Spidey was effortlessly funny? Remember the time when the love story of Spidey and a girl was really getting into your feels? And remember the time when a line in a Spider-man movie was so memorable?<br/><br/>To sum it all up, all of those hypothetical questions above were seemingly not present in The Amazing Spider-man 2.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Spider-man, and ever since this reboot of Sony; I've never been impressed. The first film failed horribly, and to be honest, it's going downhill.<br/><br/>What is obvious in the movie was that the story was not strong, after the movie; my partner and I concluded that there was no story AT ALL. It was all over the place! It was all falling apart It did bore me 2 hours running (Except for part where Spidey and Electro faced off in time square between the boring two hours) and the last 30 minutes of it was the only interesting time/s.<br/><br/>I was wondering if the entire build-up time was only for the (EXTREME SPOILER ALERT) death of Gwen Stacey? Peter Parker's father was not even the highlight of it all, when in fact it should be his. Not even the entre of the movie gave justice to Peter's father.<br/><br/>But on the positive note, the action scenes were cool; there were some fun moments and comic reliefs. The visual effects were really stunning; it really looked good on IMAX 3D. And also, the exceptional acting of Dane DeHaan who played Harry Osborn. But that's all.<br/><br/>I also had an issue with the ending of it.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacey died because of a broken spine caused by Peter himself Peter mourned for seasons, but revealed it was only 5 months, and then he's back being Spidey just like that.<br/><br/>What I mean to say is that, it was so insensitive for the filmmakers to revive Spider-man very quick when in fact there's loss and it's the loss in which you are not capable of coming back to your own self in just a short amount of time. He's Spider-man, everyone knows he's got responsibility, but c'mon, he's human after all. The entire boring 2 hours was an emotional build-up (even dark), and why would they stray away that emotional tone by the end?<br/><br/>I'm really sure about this, but it was a bad, bad movie. It was so disappointing that even the news that there's a preview of X-MEN: Days of Future Past in the mid-credits WAS NOT EVEN PRESENT.<br/><br/>This was like Spider-man 3 all over again, so many villains, so packed action scenes, but the story is non-sense. Minus the fun and comedy.<br/><br/>Compared to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, there was only one main villain and that's the Winter Soldier himself. All of the other hydra people were back-ups, but there was an uncertainty in every character, whether they'll make it or not, the tension was in the midst of the movie which were lacking in The Amazing Spider-man. CapAm was all pumped up while Spidey 2 was not.<br/><br/>This just goes to show that a Spider-man story can never work with a dark tone. Or is it just Andrew Garfield that missed being a true Spider-man that's why it's lacking? Or was it the directing over-all? Trust me; nothing beats the Spiderman series where the (AWESOME) Tobey Maguire starred.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman 2 is directed by Marc Webb and stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx and Paul Giamatti. The film was released April 30, 2014 in the Philippines and distributed by Columbia Pictures.<br/><br/>(This review is also seen in my blog www.onesettingatatime.com)"

It did it! <br/><br/>If you are a visual-maniac, Spidey 2 would be good choice for you. :) <br/><br/>However it was screwed up by ""poor"" story. Poor story does not mean simple story. In this case, it was too much complex for hero action movie. It makes me not able to focus on the visual. There were so many unnecessary stories :(<br/><br/>If the story was simple enough, overall rating could be better.<br/><br/>Overall score : 5/10"
"tristan-dryburgh","3","55","123","22 April 2014"," Simply cannot understand the hype
","Spiderman 2 is not only a children's flick but a very basic children's flick which drags on for hours as more of a try-hard deep romance, than the advertised ""action"" movie.<br/><br/>After stopping the criminals he makes it to the Graduation ceremony just as Mary J is wrapping up her speech and glides on stage to make out with her in front of the entire graduating class. It is this arrogance and cocky nature which makes Spiderman/Peter Parker difficult to like as a character. <br/><br/>Whats more is that there is no chemistry between the two lovers. The script is so ""smooth"" it's unbelievable.You'd think that with 1 1/2 hours focused on the romance there would be some sort of feeling of attachment to their relationship from the audience, but not even a whim was heard when Mary J died.<br/><br/>The action scenes (which are few and far between) are alright. The special effects are great and Jaimie Fox plays an excellent Electro (I still cant understand why thousands of volts pumping through him caused him to develop super powers)its just unfortunate that the action scenes were cut thin because of the numerous sub plots which could easily have been removed and no one would have cared. <br/><br/>Overall I was glad to leave the cinema and would have earlier if i had not been with my girlfriend. <br/><br/>Cheers Spidey"
"dkemathas","9","31","65","26 April 2014"," Finally a superhero movie that is credible to the comics.
","I went to watch the second part of Mark Webb's Spider-Man franchise yesterday. As it's precedent it stars Adrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and Sally Field as Aunt May. Both Martin Sheen and Dennis Leary who portrayed Uncle Ben and Captain Stacy make cameo appearances in this film as well. The film also introduce new characters; Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx), Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino (Paul Giamatti)and Felicia Hardy (Felicity Jones). Unlike it's previous film the musician is Hanz Zimmer, who replaced James Horner.<br/><br/>The actors's performances are outstanding, specially by actors Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. Garfield's body-language is better than Maguire's and he is way more curious, funny and emotional. Although Tobey Maguire was a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Garfield is a notch better. Emma Stone is a great choice to portray Gwen Stacy. The chemistry between her and Garfield is outstanding. Sally Field's performance as Aunty May/May Parker is marvelous and she has a bigger role in this one than it's previous venture. She is very secretive and is kind of a selfish woman who hides a lot of things for her nephew Peter. Jamie Foxx who portrayed Dillon was great even though the character is portrayed by a black actor. Dane DeHaan who played Harry Osborn/Green Goblin was good. Not as great as James Franco to play Harry Osborn, but better than Willem Dafoe to play Green Goblin.<br/><br/>The film's storyline is well-built and it's more credible to the comic books than the previous Spider-Man films. It digs deeper about Peter Parker's past and his parents's disappearance. It's more humorous, more emotional and it has a more darker tone which keeps the film interesting to watch. The costumes are stylish and more high-tech and the CGI effects are amazing. However, I felt that the final battle between Spider-Man and Electro maybe had a bit too much effects. Even though the scenes where we see Spider-Man swinging around New York City is epic, I still miss James Horner's music. Zimmer's music is cool, but I felt that it wasn't that suitable as Horner's tunes.<br/><br/>The movie is simply amazing and it deserves to be watched in the cinemas. Two thumbs way up!"
"robson_scheppa","6","80","187","14 April 2014"," Literally Amazing
","With solid 3D action, great and emotional plot, work well jokes and comedy, good soundtrack and CGI, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the best Spidey movie till here.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield, just amazing) returning to being spider-man when some new enemies starts to appears, and he tries to turn back your relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone, well like the first), in this situation Peter has to deal with new problems like Rhino (Paul Giamatti, will only briefly appear) and Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx, best thing in the movie), besides having to deal with the past problems like Harry Osborn (Dane Dehaan, basically return to your ""chronicle"" character) and the death of your parents.<br/><br/>With some unexpected plot twist, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is funny and surprising good, not disappointing in anything, the plot is human and open great opportunities for the stars of the movie, principally Andrew, Emma and Jamie Foxx. The CGI is exceptional and it's a rare real 3D case.<br/><br/>10/10 Enjoy it in IMax 3D"

","My favorite Spider Man movie ever I thought this movie was great for so many reasons, I mean they found a way to combine heart racing action with heart breaking consequences I mean like the amazing spider-man 2 was a pretty amazing movie the villians with electro and The new green goblin was good the soundtrack was good. The fight scenes. . . Yes they was good like the first one against electro and spiderman was good and all but i don't understand this movie got so much hate. And i personally loved the way Andrew Garfield portrayed the character, Going from his is un-flinching bravery, To his commitment to doing the right thing, Not to mention his love for Gwen up to her last breath. . . Literally. And the way they found out how to incorporate so many sub plots ans spin-off ideas in one movie amazed me with depth and a story behind every villan. Overall I just thought it was a great movie and I wish Sony were coming out with a part three."
"shagrog","7","26","54","1 May 2014"," Sony's marketing campaign
","This is another Spider-Man movie. Or is it?<br/><br/>While the original trilogy had a comic book feel. This one seems closer to the cartoons, namely Ultimate Spider-Man, because of it's kind of humor, character treatment and level of inconsistencies. Also, Spidey's suit seem to have been changed or maybe it's just me, but it now seems to have bigger eyes like the one on the before mentioned cartoon, which helps corroborate my theory. But that's not an issue. Let's move on to the issues.<br/><br/>The first thing of note is that it's broken down into parts and sometimes transitions aren't smooth at all. One minute we're on Spidey, then bam, we're back to the other side of the city for an seemingly unrelated part of the story. Spidey just finished a fight and we go back to Osborn offices for a very calm and discussion that has nothing to do with what happened in the last scene. And let's just forget the subtlety of Aleksei's introduction (for those who haven't seen it or don't remember, we're suddenly watching a car chase and he screams for nobody else to hear but the audience ""Introducing Aleksei Sytsevich"" or something like that).<br/><br/>The second thing, that is actually the first thing I noticed in this movie was marketing. It's so obvious that it hurts. Iron Man had all those Audi, The Winter Soldier had every car turned into a Chevrolet and Spidey has Vaio. Now, I admit I didn't check the release date of the first Vaio and this might be a sign I'm getting a bit old, but how did Peter Parker's dad have a Vaio? Wasn't his crash over 10 years ago? Were Vaio's available then? Let's assume yes, then why did Richard Parker have an old monitor in his super secret tiny lab? Space was obviously an issue, he could just have another laptop there. But it's not just product placement and the brand shining on your face. That laptop was the Hulk of laptops. It was so surprisingly resistant that the bad guy could hold on to it to avoid falling off a plane AND it still worked perfectly and finished the upload.<br/><br/>Moving on. You know what? I'll just make a list: - Harry Osborn (a.k.a. Mr. One Direction a.k.a. I-love-my-hair-and-the- serum-made-me-forget) is a pretty smart guy. Granted, he didn't recognize his best friend's voice under the suit, but he figured out things on his own, which is a step up from the regular villains of movies targeted at kids like this one. However, his father left him tons of projects that could potentially save his life and he couldn't explore more than one. He would die before reading another folder from the device Norman left him. Oh, and did you notice? His hand had a problem. Try to remember that for the rest of the movie when, for example, he's pouring drinks or beating two guards of a high security facility at once. Also, he didn't question why his father was green.<br/><br/><ul><li>Electro. To enjoy Electro you must forget everything you know about electricity. That's not a problem with the movie. This character was always unbelievable and sometimes you have to just ""give it this one"" and ignore the laws of physics to enjoy a movie. But, that aside I have to wonder. If Electro can kill with a finger, why does he just throw Spidey around? He was an electronic engineer and yet didn't take power from the backup generator or whatever it was they used to give back power to the city. If he knew it would be dangerous to him, why didn't he stay away from it? Didn't he design the whole thing? Then he knew about the backup. If he's an engineer, he should be smarter. And if (still ignoring the laws of physics, but following the logic of the movie) Electro took power from the generator and the city when out of power, how can Spidey give more power to Electro and power the city at the same time? Should he at least defeat Electro before the city can have power again? Shouldn't all the static electricity undo Gwen's hairdo? Questions, questions...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Let's talk about Gwen and romance and all that stuff. Instead of going back and forth, two VERY smart people would have established ground rules, thus keeping having ""fun"" and protecting Gwen from her imminent demise. I know, it's just following the comic story, but what I'm complaining is how they got there. ""Oh, I want you... No, I don't... Wait, I do... But I must protect you... I love you... I see dead people..."". Jesus, that sort of stuff is what leads to people getting killed. If they had enjoyed their time, I'd have felt sorry when she died, instead I was like ""well, now you don't have to decide"". She was probably tired of being picked up by him. That move has got to hurt.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Peter Parker is not the nerdy Peter Parker everyone can relate to.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>New York's ground it way too sensitive. It breaks at minimum impact.</li></ul><br/><br/>The good stuff: - It was funny in a cartoonish way, which is something the old trilogy didn't explore. - Kinda cool CGI. No problems there. Except, why does Electro materialize with boxers? OK, I get the boxers, but why the catheters? Where did he get the suit? The suit has a small lightning bolt, so it was definitely made for him. - Hairdos always perfect. - Felicia introduced. Doc Oc and Vulture hinted. - I guess there's no Mary Jane. That's good. I guess. We already had that. - Reference to Jameson. - Acting was OK. - Story was meh. If they cut most of the Gwen back-and-forth drama, they could have focused on putting the pieces together with better transitions and perhaps a little more than goblin's ""I just came by to kill your girlfriend""."

","""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is the worst movie of this hero, with terrible story and villains and boring romance. Max Dillon, a.k.a. Electro, is a needy moronic lonely engineer that worships the Spider-Man and after an accident, he becomes a powerful stupid enemy that destroys part of New York. Harry Osborn, a.k.a. Green Goblin, is poorly developed; when his father is on the death bed, he learns that he has the same disease that is killing him and becomes CEO of the corporation without any experience. Soon he makes a quick research, has a short dialog with the Spider–Man and becomes his enemy after an announced accident. The romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy is boring and repetitive. There is an importance in Peter Parker's parents and Uncle Ben is practically forgotten. There are good action scenes and special effects but that is all. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Espetacular Homem-Aranha 2: A Ameaça de Electro"" (""The Amazing Spider-Man 2 – The Threaten of Electro"")"

There were no unnecessary conversations and it was mature. This movie wasn't. It was way too long. There was a lot of explanation going on about the mystery around Peter's parents and the thing between Peter and Gwen. This took a lot of space in the movie so we didn't get a lot to see from Electro, Goblin and especially the Rhino. That was a big disappointment. Somewhere in the movie I saw the suit of Dr. Octavius, will he be there in the third movie? I don't have much more to say about this movie, only that it was a big disappointment. Now up to the third movie; will that one be only action? The mystery about the parents, Peter's father, is solved. There is nothing more left. Maybe Peter finding the killer of his uncle, but even that provides a thin shred of story. Will Gwen Stacey and her father be forgotten when Mary-Jane will appear? Will the lizard come back? Will the third movie vanish the story of the first two? Will Venom and Carnage appear? I don't know. Do I care? Maybe a little.

","I went to see this movie with some friends on a Friday night. I didn't expect anything from this film, unless to be enjoyable. I was nothing less that amazed by the stupidity of the whole thing, even if it didn't start badly... The first sequence where Spider-Man chase a truck in Manhattan is at some point very impressive. The moment when we follow Spidey flying between the building, we almost feel like if we were with him. In fact, we could resume the movie with what I have already told : most of the action sequence are well directed, but apart from that, there's nothing to be satisfied with. Half of the film is focused on the Peter-Gwen love story, and I can guarantee you that you will do nothing else than sigh. And the villains! There's a lot to talk about (but not in good sadly...). To not spoil you, I will only speak about Electro. At first, his name is Max, but the problem is, that you don't have enough scene to understand the psychology of the character (if there is one), so you just think that he's just a very stupid guy, and I have to say that Jamie Foxx's interpretation is probably for something. And when he turn into a bad guy, well... we almost don't see his power until the last thirty minute, where Marc Webb must have noticed that we had seen enough of cheesy scene between the two lovers. So we get a terrible action scene, where the director put all the element he can. But it just turn amazingly bad, and we almost have an overdose of bad CGI - because yes, the CGI are bad. I could write a lot more to convince to not spend one dollar for this movie, but it would turn just as boring as the film was... The first was bad, the second is worse."

Every single character arc felt extremely unnatural and awkward. I found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, including Spider-Man. The majority of the lines in this film were extremely awful. I was painfully eager for nearly every scene to be over so that I could gain some respite from the awkwardness and pointless nature of the scenes. The first film was campy, sometimes annoyingly so, but overall, the story was well written. That is not the case with this sequel. The only redeeming aspect is that there are about 2-3 scenes where the jokes are genuinely funny.<br/><br/>Another aspect that was immediately annoying was that the action scenes felt chaotic and hard to follow, especially at the beginning. It seemed like they were all too close; as though someone had zoomed in too far with the camera. I did not notice if this continued throughout the film because I honestly stopped caring about the results of any of the conflicts less than half way through the movie due to the awful story.<br/><br/>Even with low expectations, this film did not even prove to entertain. It was simply difficult to sit through."

","The movie starts with promise and quickly descends into failure. The characters were underdeveloped, the story was disjointed,and our web- head spent the majority of the movie stalking his love interest.<br/><br/>Electro gets his name and a nice pretty suit out of nowhere just like Peter's friendship with Harry. The dots in this story weren't connected by any means of the imagination.<br/><br/>This movie feels like a crappier version of Raimi's Spider-Man 3 re- visited: One cool villain with great cgi, and the rest just sort of rushed and tossed in, (instead of a Crappy whiney Venom we got a crappy cartoony Rhino) thus overloading our hero's plate and our mind's eye.<br/><br/>Once again Oscorp is at the center of our movie world and this apparently will be the continuing theme in this franchise, moving further and further away from comic canon.<br/><br/>Most of what you saw in the trailers misleads the direction of the entire film, many scenes didn't even make the final cut. Basically if you saw the right trailer, you've seen the end."

I can't wait for all the fans and movie fans of movie watch this. The villains are good in this movie, the green goblin was a little bit creepy than I thought it would have been, Electro looked really cool with his electric power, Rhino was there for about 2 minutes which was at the end.

","This movie ties up loose ends from the first film while also expanding on the already dedicated love of the character.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's characterisation is a perfect representation of what he should be and Andrew Garfield plays the part with absolute perfection. He eliminates the idea that Spider-Man and Peter Parker are the same person by giving the two characters their own layers and depths worthy of respect and admiration. As Spider-Man, he's the classic trash-talking, sarcastic mischievous hero while as Peter Parker, he's the relatable teenager struggling with everything life throws at us all: his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) plays a fundamental part in this as he struggles to keep the promise he made to a dying Captain Stacy, Gwen's father. The chemistry between the two (with aid from Andrew and Emma's real life partnership) add a layer of reality to their relationship; with every scene shared between the two feeling grounded and real. Dare I say, the dynamic between the two is also incredibly cute.<br/><br/>Other characters involve Harry Osborn (Dane Dehaan), Peter's childhood best friend recently returned from attending school away, and Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx): the pitiful, lonesome electrician who falls victim to a tragic accident transforming him into the powerful villain, Electro. Even as the electrified baddie, Max's character remains to grasp the audience's pity. However, this is changed when Max feels betrayed by Spider-Man and uses his powers to destroy and kill instead. Harry, on the other hand, continues to have a similar relationship with Peter as Gwen had: the two share great chemistry and the dynamic feels natural and fluid. Harry's been told by his dying father that the 'Osborn Curse' has befallen Harry, forcing him to do anything he can to salvage his derailing health. However, Harry's time is short-spent before he transforms into the already-confirmed Green Goblin. This makes his development feel like it's reached it's limit before his first appearance in the franchise is even finished. Had his character been drawn out more, there may have been more time to add to his character, although what was delivered from him (and Dehaan's stunning performance) was enough to make you both like and fear Harry equally.<br/><br/>The story balances the main narrative and the sub-plot involving the mystery behind Peter's parents wonderfully and the two never feel forced or out of place from one another. Each character has their own part within the film and have the right to be there (as apposed to the overwhelming amount of clashes between Sandman, Venom and New-Goblin in Spider-Man 3). The action-packed sequences alike have their reason to be there too and never feel forced in order to create some excitement as they each play their own significant part in both character/story development.<br/><br/>Lastly, the film expresses all kinds of emotions from the audiences that really make the viewer invest into the story and characters alike; making you love and relate to them. The film is a wonderful addition to an already fantastic franchise in which Marc Webb truly expresses his love and devotion of the character making this portrayal of the web-slinging hero one to be remembered and loved!"

","First of all, it was a pleasant film, although it received a lot of bad reviews I think we can say a good movie. Much better in terms of visual effects compared to the previous spiderman series, of course, the reason for this is the difference in years.<br/><br/>If we look at the beginning of the film briefly I liked the first plane scene in the first film they continued the subject.
later battle scenes visual effects according to the first film did not develop much in terms of, in fact, the biggest difference of amazing spiderman we watched too many spiderman, but I didn't see much of peter parker's own life so I think the first three Spiderman movies more beautiful than this series.
just focus on the action and forget the Peter Parker I felt like Peter Parker was just investigating his family.<br/><br/>I didn't like the bad character it should be used another bad character in my opinion instead of Electro.
Harry Osborn was also a very short battle scene as the goblin came to the last scene of the film, and it seems to me that they wanted to keep it in the sequel, just like they had a preview and we don't enough see harry and peter friendship.<br/><br/>They've skipped too many topics and focused more on the action instead I think they could have done better than the first series."

"Wuchakk","6","2","2","8 July 2017"," Decent sequel with mature tone & listless story, but excellent (shocking) final act
","Released in 2014 and directed by Marc Webb, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" stars Andrew Garfield as the troubled, but likable hero with spider powers who struggles with relationship issues with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and battles Electro (Jamie Foxx), a humble electrical engineer transformed into a living electric generator. Dane DeHaan is also on hand as Harry Osborn, who has a startling transformation of his own. Sally Field plays Aunt May while Felicity Jones appears as Felicia.<br/><br/>It's best to watch the first film before this one because some story elements transfer over. It features the same main cast and has the same tone, so if you liked that one you'll probably like this sequel. Thankfully, they fixed Spider-Man's costume, noticeably the mask & eyes. While I like the mature, sometimes reverential tone, the story feels listless, particularly the part revolving around Electro (which is thoroughly changed from the comics). Foxx is fine; I just found the character, as written, uninteresting. Ditto with the other convoluted subplot. DeHaan works better as the second villain (I'm not going to say who, but it's obvious if you know anything about Spider-Man).<br/><br/>Thankfully, everything perks up in the final act where the creators do something bold. I didn't think they'd do it and found it almost shocking, although they didn't milk it for it's potential (but they did well enough). Even the Rhino shows up.<br/><br/>The movie runs 142 minutes and was shot in New York (The City, Rochester & Long Island) and Los Angeles.

","The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a movie directed by Marc Webb,Spider man is played by Andrew Garfield who suits perfectly with the role,in my opinion even better than Tobey,although i liked Raimi's trilogy a lot,it was my childhood. I enjoyed how they showed Spider-Man,i mean he is one of the most amazing superheroes,why? Because he is a friendly web-slinger,he might give you a ride,he might buy something to eat for homeless guy. They also added his humor,which i think was kind of missing from Raimi's trilogy,no matter how hard can his private life be,he is always funny. They also concentrated a lot on Peters relationship with Gwen,because as we know from the comics he is a ""hard luck charlie"" or whatever they call him.Also this is just the beginning ,Webb tried to expand the spidey's universe,we will see smythe who made spider-slayers,Sinister-Six and probably venom. BTW don't miss the scene after the credits,it is amazing and we might even see spidey with X-men! Do not listen to haters,i am pretty sure that most of them haven't even seen the movie,if you love comics then you will probably love this movie. Thanks for reading."

","While The Amazing Spiderman boasted a good storyline and well developed characters, the latest offering of the franchise has little to offer except for the number of villains.<br/><br/>The story is weak, the characters under-developed and at one point of time you are just waiting for the movie to finish.<br/><br/>The main villain, as portrayed in various posters and trailers, Electro has been provided with a weak background story and doesn't get the kind of screen presence a main villain should get. The main focus (intentionally or unintentionally) shifts to the other bad guy, Green Goblin played by Dane DeHaan who plays it quite convincingly. Paul Giamatti playing Rhino has been totally wasted.<br/><br/>It feels like Mark Webb wanted to send as many villains against Spiderman as possible without developing even a single one. If the movie had been any longer he might have added a dozen more villains.<br/><br/>The only plus point of the movie would be Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's Chemistry and their scenes together provide the movie its much needed charm.<br/><br/>I watched the 3-D version and found it to be much better than many recent movies.<br/><br/>Overall The Amazing Spiderman 2 may have its moments but it fails to prove as 'Amazing' as promised by the title."

","You know when you have great ingredients to cook a great meal but somehow manage to mess up your dish entirely? Well here we have great actors, great writers, incredibly talented C.G.I artists, an enormous budget and best of all one of the most iconic Marvel super hero of all time and yet somehow they managed to make an unstructured and unbalanced mess out of this movie.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 goes from comedy to intense drama to high speed super hero slow motion action scenes. It takes you on a mood swing trip as if you were a monkey on speed. At first you think: ""Hell yes! Spider-Man! I am in for a ride! Bring it on!"" But suddenly you realize that this movie is completely out of balance. The tone of the whole movie leaves you in a state of confusion. It doesn't seem to be a streamlined movie at all. Where does it go? Do we laugh now? Do we cry now? What is all this nonsense? Of course they have promoted this movie through the roof with showing off trailers and video clips of high tech 2014 ready C.G.I action scenes. It's safe to say that TASM2 looks stunning with crazy super slow motion micro detailed comic book flavored scenes. But at some point it was as if the different C.G.I scenes had to compete against each other to stand out, and therefore they became somewhat of a distraction of the whole flow of the movie. This is also the problem with basically all other scenes. The drama isn't bad, the acting isn't bad, it's good in fact. But they don't build up to it, they just magically appear. We suddenly get pulled out because of yet another deeply romantic love scene or yet another highly dramatic plot twist and I ask myself so many times during this movie: This doesn't make sense at all, and why am I seeing this now at this precise moment, please just carry on with the story! Didn't Marc Webb ever heard of the principle: ""Less Is More?"". It's more like ""more is bigger and better equals more drama, more comedy and let's trow in another bad guy!"" with this flick.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, it really felt as if there were too many people involved in making decisions in this movie. I imagine Marc Webb trying to do his own thing in his little working room and suddenly some big corporate Sony guy comes in and says: NO WE NEED MORE ACTION AND MORE SUPER BAD GUYS..! And... errr... EXPLOSIONS!!! And there, we have Marc Webb all teary eyed wanting to just make a 500 Days Of Summer Spider-Man remix. Well Marc, you can't just do your emotional thing and trying to mix and match this with big budget superhero movies. If there is one company that has it down (and I passionately share the opinion of many other true believers) it's Marvel. So Marc or Sony, if you guys are reading this, you have told your origin story of Spider-Man (again), but now is the time to give back the torch to Marvel so we can continue to see Spider-Man in a much greater light.<br/><br/>So my score is 4 out of 10: 3 points for great actors (1 for Garfield, 1 for Dehaan and 1 for that subway pigeon that took a giant dump on Emma Stone's head) and 1 point for that Asian guy who made the realistic Spidey fart effect during the swinging scene in daylight NY."

Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, looks gorgeous. Jamie Foxx as Electro/Max Dillon, delivers the best performance in the film. He's creepy & menacing. Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn, hams.

","I still don't know what is the point of these Amazing Spider-Man movies? Three Spider-man movies came out before, so why are the directors making the same movies again? Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are good actors, but not good as the originals. I found Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst way better at being Marry Jane Watson and Spiderman/ Peter Parker. I don't get what is the point of going to the movies and watching a worse version of Spiderman. Why didn't the director make a Spiderman movie with a different story line. This is what happens when greedy people want to make money and cant think outside the box. Hollywood cant come up with any new ideas? I love Spiderman, but I disliked this movie for its lack of originality.<br/><br/>The only reason why I am giving this movie 5/10 is because of the action. There was action, but that's not enough for a movie. I watched the first Amazing Spiderman movie, and now I have watched the second. And I have to admit they are getting worse. Do not go waste your movie on this, which is an exact copy of the original Spiderman 2. What I suggest is, if you have a DVD of Spiderman 2, or have Netflix, go watch it there instead of watching this crappier version. I am not even going to see the third from how disappointed I was. Save your money and watch something original, and something you don't know what's going to happen every second."

","Wow. The Amazing Spider-Man was a bad movie, and surely there could be no way that the sequel, with established characters, could be worse, right? Wrong. Clocking in at 142 mins, how is it possible for this movie to rush so many elements? Harry's turn happens so quickly, and is poorly handled, not to mention that Dane DeHaan is woefully miscast in the role. Speaking of miscast, hello there Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>Everyone raved about the chemistry between Garfield and Stone from the first movie (even though the writing was so cringeworthy). Well, this time around it's just flat out annoying! Stone is so irritating on screen that by the time she dies, you're actually almost a little thankful. For fans of the comics, the death isn't handled right either, despite how some people might want you to think it is.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only good thing about the movie is that James Horner has been replaced on scoring duties. However, Hans Zimmer still doesn't get the feel right, and is leagues below Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>No doubt this movie will appeal to the market Sont intended when they announced a reboot, but with the way Marvel have presented their superhero offerings, it shows up how messing with something that already worked was perhaps not the best idea."
"matt_everitt","5","23","49","1 May 2014"," High budget poor direction.
","I wouldn't necessarily class myself as a superhero whiz-kid, but I do know a bit about what to expect from a good film and unfortunately this was below average. Perhaps I'm being a little harsh, but if you compare a superhero franchise such as the Dark Knight to the writings of Kurtzman & Orci, you'll understand that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not so amazing at all. These writers had previously worked on such films as the Transformer series, so how could they forget how to write an action film within a year? The typical last second save of a persons life, is literally text book stuff. When will we see something that isn't inevitably predictable? <br/><br/>What enraged me was the lack of originality, the poor continuity and excessive/unnecessary use of music throughout the production. I can only question whether the audio department had done their jobs correctly if they believed adding an inappropriate/unnecessary songs would mask their errors. Maybe I'm looking too far into it and in fact it was an attempt to appeal to a younger target audience. Regardless, I didn't like it.<br/><br/>For anyone who isn't familiar with Webb's work, you should know that throughout his career, directing action/adventure movies is not a regular occurrence; which is evident within The Amazing Spider-Man 2. It just shows that anyone with a slight interest in action and a high budget can produce a run-of-the-mill action film.<br/><br/>By employing just under 400 people within the visual effects department, Marc Webb clearly states his intentions for the movie. Its no secret that the Spider-Man films are nothing less than visually amazing, but when the plot suffers as a result of this you have to question Webb's decisions.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film was entertaining and the casts performance was exceptional, in specifically Garfield (Spider-Man). I imagine the younger target audience would get out the cinema and instantly be mimicking Spider-Man's web-slinging abilities."
"Jakestro","6","23","49","18 April 2014"," This Spider-Man is indeed amazing - But the web spun around it feels clumsy
","This Spider-Man is indeed amazing, but the web spun around the film is somewhat clumsy, with too many fuzzy strands to do the wall crawler justice.<br/><br/>Okay, now that the obligatory Spidey metaphor is out of the way - Amazing Spider-Man 2 is in my opinion stronger than it's predecessor but falls far short of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 benchmark. Might not be a fair comparison though since I still contend that Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is in my top 5 comic book films of all time. Garfield is cutting the perfect figure as the web slinger and sharing an infectious on screen chemistry with Emma Sone as Gwen Stacey.<br/><br/>But my beef with this films lays with two main problems - the writers and the director. Sure, there was some bad acting as well, but I believe that was due to the script the actors were handed.<br/><br/>Let me say, I enjoyed this film, in fact I really enjoyed this film but I do have to talk about the parts that I didn't enjoy first so I can get to the good stuff later.<br/><br/>Okay so problem number one, the writing in this film is bad, like blatantly bad. I mean, they nailed Spideys comic-book-perfect sarcasm but other than that.. nope not cutting it. I looked the writers up on IMDb to see the rest of credits... mystery solved! It's scripted by the same duo behind the Transformers franchise - suddenly it's shortcomings become more understandable. Kurtzman and Orci are masters of ''whizz-bang'' ''oohs'' and ''aahs'' shoehorned into a mechanical plot provided to advance the story but nothing more. All the baddie origins here make you wistful for the Sandman creation sequence in Spider-Man 3, which isn't something I thought I'd ever say. Electro is lumbered with a shockingly clichéd birth with Foxx struggling (and failing) to make him anything more than the film's time bomb to be diffused. The electric effects are great though if that makes up for anything, and his face-offs with Spidey really do pop.<br/><br/>Problem number two is that of director Marc Webb - Webb struggles to maintain a coherent tone, often veering between hyper-real CGI mayhem and soft-focus Twilight-esque teen dreaminess. This is what really threw me off - one second you're watching this great spectacle of an action scene, and then within literally seconds the scene along with the dialogue turns to this really cheesy nonsensical Twilight-esque love scene but with Garfield in tights. I guess the best way to describe it would be like squinting to focus your eyes – all the elements are there but you just can't quite see them all at once. You could tell the film is designed to attract audiences of all demographics, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing - if only it didn't make everything feel shoehorned in. It basically struggles to be it's own thing, even if Raimi's incarnation weren't to your taste, the films did clearly have a defined style that made them distinctive.<br/><br/>I feel kind of like saying more would spoil the film and it's still good enough to avoid doing that.<br/><br/>Aaand finally we get to the things I liked about the film, credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>This Spidey flick does go places that the previous incarnation shied away from and even tweaks the tear ducts ever so slightly at points. Comic-book fans will certainly be pleased to see some elements - Spidey's sarcasm - be more in line with the comic books.<br/><br/>The film opens with public support growing in the web heads favor as Parker graduates high school and starts college. However, Spider-Man finds himself up against a new foe - Electro played by Jamie Foxx. Meanwhile the return of his childhood friend Harry Osborn played by Dane DeHaan threatens to throw his life into even further chaos. As to be expected, cue plenty of plot twists that anyone with half a brain could see coming from a mile away and mayhem on a city-wide scale. You certainly can't fault it for its scope.<br/><br/>People have been so scared of the amount of villains in the film, pretty much everyone I know was expecting another Spider-Man 3 fiasco – but I have to say, the clutter of villains is actually more about setting up spin-offs and further sequels than overcrowding. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the villains work though – they are hampered by mechanical plotting which of course leads back to the writing that also holds Webb's film back from really hitting the heights it could've. <br/><br/>At least Webb and the writers do wrap up and tie a bow on the somewhat irritating parents-as-spy-scientists story thread, thankfully not robbing Peter of his ''ordinary Joe'' back story as the first film threatened to do. With the past dealt with, you realize how much time has been spent on it and with the middle of the film getting dangerously close to being boring. This is especially frustrating when we're rushed into the final reel, ruing the lack of time for stronger character work that could have made the ensuing drama even more impactive.<br/><br/>As the credits roll, the exciting action and Spidey's comic-book-perfect sarcasm stay longest in the mind, just winning the day, along with Garfield and Stone's genuinely effective relationship. It's just a shame they're not better served by a film that isn't the sum of its often- inspired parts.<br/><br/>But here's the big question - If you find yourself standing at your cinema with a choice between The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Captain America 2, Marvel still triumphs in my opinion. Spidey is always worth watching though and admittedly did leave me with a desire to see more.<br/><br/>If you want more reviews please visit www.themoviecorner.net, thanks for reading!"

They become quite close and start developing the friendship once more. Little does Parker know that Harry is dying from his Father's DNA an he needs Spider-Man's blood in order to survive. Parker/Spider-Man refuses to do so, as it might have a bad effect. So Harry has other ways of getting to stay alive. I will let you figure out where it goes from there.<br/><br/>We have Jamie Foxx playing Electro. Jamie Foxx, I must admit, did not do a bad job at playing Electro/Max. However, he did not do the best. His electricity effects were so fake, it looked photo shopped. The fight scenes were okay. But, for those wandering about the green Goblin. He was only in it for about 4 and a half minutes with a 3 minute fight scene. Yes, I timed it! The death of Gwen (Emma Stone) was really unexpected, but necessary.

","I thought the first ""Amazing"" Spider-Man film was extremely tepid, but then again much of that was just re-telling the whole story of Peter's origin all over again, so I thought this one had to be a step up, but boy was I wrong... For starters they cram in three underdeveloped villains, none more so than the Rhino, who literally appears there for about 2 seconds. No seriously, they just cram him into the final five minutes of the film with about 2 seconds of actual combat and as soon as Spider-Man is actually about to land a punch the film immediately ends. I honestly think it should be illegal for them to even include the Rhino in the adverts and poster if he is given this much screen time, under false advertising. Similarly, the Green Goblin is often ranked as the number one villain for Spider-Man in many polls and again was given just one short 3 minute fight with Spidey before being defeated. Electro actually had some development but it actually undermined the characters motives: basically he was a huge Spider-Man fan met him, saw that Spider-Man was on a big TV and decided to try and kill him (no seriously, this is exactly what happened) It was also cringe worthily cheesy during any actual slight sniff of combat: including Spider-Man pulling down a robbers underwear and wearing a firefighter's helmet when stealing a hose to spray Electro There are so many other plot holes and flaws it's best to just list the main ones here or I'll be here all day, so: 1. Electro looks and acts nothing like in the comics (particularly the fact he's a black guy in a hoodie) 2. The Rhino is a robot that appears for 5 seconds 3. Spider-Man has an infinite supply of his webbing 4. Oscorp is literally the most ridiculous company of all time, they almost killed everyone in the city on countless occasions and even mention how they had to get rid of all animal experiments only for Electro to be turned into what he was by some fish (another animal) 6. Harry has no understanding of any medical science whatsoever and is completely oblivious of any possible problems with just injecting himself with a random blood/chemical sample. 7. Gwen acts as if she's already secured a place at uni when all she is doing is being interviewed and then the second the interview is over they send her on a jet to England 8. A mother decides to send her kid to watch a terrorist shoot at police and destroy the city just because he likes to dress up as Spider-Man. Overall, a horrible mess of a very cheesy movie compounded by the 2 seconds of action involving the Rhino. AWFUL!!!"
"jmillerdp","5","18","37","30 April 2014"," Roberto ""The Decider"" Orci Strikes Again!
","(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Co-Screenwriter Orci declared himself ""The Decider"" of all Star Trek when he threw a fit after receiving criticism over the impossibly awful ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (a.k.a. The final nail in the Trek coffin). Well, Bob, you can have it! ""Star Trek"" stopped being ""canon"" after Gene Roddenberry was last allowed to be involved with the films, that is, after 1979's ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" Everything since then has been fan fiction, written by people who had zero to do with ""Star Trek"" before they wrote their screenplays.<br/><br/>And, so it is with ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" which I call ""The movie no one asked for. Again!"" After the 1 for 3 Sam Raimi series (like Nolan's Dark Knights, only the middle one is worth watching), Sony wants more money out of Spider-Man, which I am guessing is the only Marvel property they have access to. And, that's the only reason this sequel exists.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I got to see it in 3-D and Dolby Atmos for free. I never would've paid anything beyond my monthly Satellite TV fees to see it. Like Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3,"" this sequel is overpacked by Orci and his faithful screen writing sidekick Alex Kurtzman (a guy who's thankfully far less bitchy than Orci!). Like ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" this movie ping pongs back and forth between this part and that part nonstop until the final oh-isn't-that-cool? image.<br/><br/>I think Orci and Kurtzman do this overstuffed screen writing so that everything's coming at you so fast that you're not supposed to notice the endless plot holes and inconsistencies. But, after STID, I am used to sitting there wondering ""Hey, what about this?"" or ""Hey, what about that?"" questions. People who know the Spider-Man story know what's going to happen to a major character. So, you're just waiting to the end to see how the character is killed off.<br/><br/>There's lots of metaphysical stuff going on throughout, but little of it makes much impact, since you know it's just the screen writing gears grinding for almost 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>Marc Webb does okay, but TAS-M2 is pretty much like TAS-M, just lots of sound and fury signifying nothing. Daniel Mindel, who (unfortunately, in my opinion) is going to DP ""Star Wars Episode VII"" provides fairly routine, soft images. Honestly, the great Peter Suschitzky, who shot ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is still very much around! It's insane that he isn't being used on any of these latter-day ""Star Wars"" films.<br/><br/>Anyway, unless you just need some background noise running on your TV on an otherwise quiet Sunday, just skip this installment. Trust me, you've seen all of it before!<br/><br/>***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)"

","I have been waiting 2 years for this movie. 2 YEARS!!!! I finally get to see it. The trailer looked fantastic the 20 minutes of footage they showed us in all of the trailers looked amazing(20 minutes is a small exaggeration). After getting myself over excited I get slapped in the face. Then a blow to the gut. Andrew was pretty good(Not as good as Tobey Maguire but good). Dane Dehann I was shocked by because he played the best performance in my opinion. I didn't like the way he looked as the green goblin but he was the best actor in the whole movie. Electro let me down really bad. They didn't show me enough, it didn't satisfy my hunger for the series. I didn't like the first one much but after watching this I appreciated it a whole lot better. It felt like Spiderman 3, everything was rushed, they didn't have a good flow. Great visuals, but spider-man 3 had just as good visuals.I guess I shouldn't of expected too much, honestly, if I had went into this movie without thinking too much about how good it was going to be then I would think this movie was pretty good. The fight scenes weren't that good either. Advice to everybody, don't get your hopes up."
"ovc89","4","20","42","25 April 2014"," The writers wasted this movie's potential
","I hardly ever review movies here, but I had to on this one. It just bothered me too much that there was so much wasted talent in this movie.<br/><br/>I thought all the actors did their best with what they had, except maybe DeHaan. I compare this movie only to the previous series (from Sam Rami), of which I'm not a fan.<br/><br/>Garfield was actually a little bit better than Maguire as Spiderman. Apparently, he's closer to the comic book personality. For the ones who thought he was unlikable, remember he's a teenager that just graduated High School; he thinks he's God. He's reckless and an a-hole, just as u would expect from a teenager with actual superpowers.<br/><br/>The villains, on the other hand... sucked. There was no development for them whatsoever. Rhino appears at the beginning and the end, serving no apparent purpose to the main plot other than to say that Spidey is fighting crime. The same could have been done with a regular bank robbery or something.<br/><br/>Electro was not just unrealistically lonesome (""forever alone?""), but he didn't seem to have any good reasons to really hate Spiderman the way he did. The transition from an innocent good guy who's been screwed hard by people to a hateful villain can be called forced or non-existent. He didn't even seem to have any motivations for anything, really. He just sort of... did stuff. If he was the smart guy he was supposed to be, he should have been trying to come up with some sort of plan for revenge against his real enemies: Oscorp. I optimistically thought at times that they wanted to base him on those people that go on random shooting sprees all over the US, but even that didn't happen (if that's what they tried, they failed). Instead, he was more like Schwarzenegger's Mr Freeze, and not just aesthetically.<br/><br/>Then, just as Electro was killed, the Green Goblin appears for no apparent reason other than to mess with Spidey. The portrayal of Harry Osbourne was angry and creepy from the beginning, which makes him an obvious villain (don't know if this was on purpose, it could be blamed on the actor). Contrast that with James Franco's Osbourne, which was actually shown as Peter's friend, and makes you feel bad that they had to fight each other. Or with DaFoe's character, which also keeps you guessing, and feeling uneasy when he dies. I will concede that the conversion of Harry into the Green Goblin was more convincing in TAS2 than in the previous series, as it's shown as his search for a cure to his genetic disease, rather than some convenient accident. Still, the problematic relationship that should be there didn't take hold at all. This character should have been either the main villain in the movie, or just preparing to be on the next, without ever actually fighting the hero. If his purpose here was just to get Gwen to die, she should have died in the fight against Electro. His presence in the last 20 mins of the film seems forced.<br/><br/>Overall, a great waste of perfectly good actors and visual effects due to general incoherence in the story."
"Theraxorterminate","2","20","42","25 April 2014"," It feels like I'm the only one who didn't enjoy it as everyone else.
","(Warning a few spoilers might appear)<br/><br/>Oh Boy, where do I start? First, I admit that I had huge expectations and after waiting so long for this sequel and was finally able to see it I can honestly say that I'm pretty much disappointed with this presentation.<br/><br/>My first complaint is that the scenes with Peter and Gwen was given too much time. OK but I understood the way how director Marc Webb wanted to give the time to the most important characters in this series but didn't everyone else felt that because of those scenes it almost made the movie more of a romance? In my view it felt like the kind of Spider-Man movie I was watching suddenly disappeared, no seriously it did for me. The romance wasn't so well presented in fact it became very awkward and cheesy after a while, I cringed a little bit on some of the romantic lines that feels like they have been taken from a bad teen show. Sometimes I'm wondering if Marc Webb was the wrong choice to direct the ""new"" Spider-Man movies because I don't think that he was the right one to do these which comes to my next complaint.<br/><br/>The movie felt a bit unbalanced, it's like director Marc Webb had a difficult work trying to figure out the perfect timings. Although the beginning of the movie was impressive but then everything else felt predictable apart from the 'near' end which was the only balanced scene I thought.<br/><br/>Another complaint is that this movie wasn't so exciting. I feel quite tricked by all these trailers I've watched so many times that after all there wasn't so many action in it. OK look I know that action isn't the most important genre of all the movies but come on! If a movie is supposed to be action then give some nice excitement that everyone could enjoy and I got a pretty bad drama movie with lots of bad romance instead with very little action! DO NOT LET THE TRAILERS FOOL YOU! <br/><br/>Next is that in the half of the movie 'til the end there are some flaws that almost made the movie look stupid and totally ignore a little continuity and the characters for how they can do things that didn't seem so possible or logical.<br/><br/>The positives I can say about the movie is the action which was pretty good but again too short. I was happy to see that the new suit for Spidey was fixed and simply looked way better than he had in the first and more closer to the way the suit always looked. Electro was good and that's pretty much it from me.<br/><br/>But still the movie felt boring, dull and uninspiring, a big disappointed blockbuster for me."
"WhySoSerious2007","4","20","42","24 April 2014"," With great budget comes great responsibility!
","Spidey would have to be one of the most popular super-heroes of our time. He's been my favourite ever since I saw the Nicholas Hammond movie length TV pilot as a child. Since then, there had been periodic rumours about a Spidey movie, but nothing until Mr. Raimi's Trilogy that blew Spidey fans out of the water.....and many others! (Well, 2 movies of that Trilogy did anyway, but that's another review) Then a new incarnation came along via Mr. Mark Webb.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman was a great re-invention of the Raimi raised franchise, great cast and crew seemed to give us Spidey fans.....and the many others yet another winning Spidey flick to love.......So?.....What happened here? Amazing Spiderman 2 has mostly the same cast that appealed to fans of the first one. It has the same director, who I must say, done a terrific job directing. The problem is not HOW he directed, but WHAT he directed.<br/><br/>The action scenes are the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants, roller-coaster stuff that we have come to expect (rightly so) and love in modern action cinema. Webb's direction makes us feel, on more than one occasion, that we ARE Spidey, or at least hanging on to him for dear life as he swings his way through the city. It's great stuff and if watched in 3D there are some nice effects thrown in at times also. The action sequences are all done well and raise the heartbeat a little. Exactly what we want in a super-hero flick. Only problem is, these scenes are way too few and far between.<br/><br/>Way too much time is spent on character development. Back-story takes up some time also, but nowhere near as much as the characters relationships with each other. Plus the back-story is interesting to watch, whilst the relationships, especially that of Peter's relationship with Gwen, seem to drag on and hold up the pace of the movie significantly and we are left almost praying for the next action scene to hurry up and grace us. But the action scenes seem to arrive late each time. Yes, they try and make up for their tardiness, but 'Too little, too late' is an emerging motto as this slow paced movie progresses.<br/><br/>Of course character development is important in any film, but not at the expense of the more important elements. This is, after all, Spiderman and super-hero movies are kinda meant to be primarily action based. At times The Amazing Spiderman 2 seems to forget it's a super-hero movie. It's a pity, because it had the potential to be a great sequel to it's great prequel."
"gggmathieu","5","15","30","6 May 2014"," just OK, Should of been much better.
","This movie was a big let down. It wasn't bad, but it seemed as if this movie felt very forced with many unnecessary scenes. It definitely wasn't edited properly. There are many mini plots and scenes that have no significance. At times I felt like this movie had to fill out a checklist of scenes that had to be in the movie even thought they don't fit into the story, which they are many. The acting was great. Dane was my favorite character. And it's nice to see Spider-man being silly and making jokes with his enemies. I thought the CGI was a little bit too much. I liked it better when film makers used CGI to make things seem more realistic. Now it seems as if it's used to make things look more like a cartoon. The villains weren't developed properly. Electro wasn't a good villain because he had no clear motive. He was a psychological mess. These types of people don't make good villains in movies, neither in real life. This movie has no excuses. They just needed to find a reason for him to hate spider-man, it's poor screen writing. Rhino and Goblin are in it for an insignificant amount of time. There was no room for them, but they squashed them in anyway. But the main reason why I didn't enjoy it was because of the story and it's structure. The audience can't get emotionally involved with anything because there are too many plots. When this movie kept switching plots around you sometimes forget that other things are going on. And when they reappear you don't care anymore. This film tried to put too many apples in a bag that wasn't big enough, so the bag broke. The script had many other flaws, especially with dialogue. The script was the main reason why this movie suffered. I guess they should of thrown out that checklist."
"cadillac20","5","12","23","2 May 2014"," Very Underwhelming
","I felt the same about the first film and had higher expectations of the sequel. With the villains involved, I had higher hopes for a better, more action packed sequel. And there were things I appreciated. But for the most part, this sequel suffered from some disappointing sequelitis, the same kinds of things we've seen in numerous other comic book flick sequels. Suffice to say, while I wasn't too disappointed, with lowered expectations, it is sad to see this film fall short. But let's talk about what's good first.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was easily the scenes between Garfield and Stone. Both actors are excellent in their roles and have fantastic chemistry together. When they share their scenes, their relationship is believable and it's something you can completely get behind. It's the one area of the film that Webb improves over the Raimi trilogy. There's also some decent action. The action involving Electro especially is great, with a fantastic display of special effects and an exciting sense of motion. <br/><br/>However, unfortunately, this is where a lot of the good stuff ends. Much of the rest of the film ranges from mediocre to bad. Pretty much anything involving Harry Osborne is cringe worthy, particularly when he starts losing his sanity. While the action involving Electro is excellent, everything about the character seems to lack depth and interest. His plight isn't the least bit interesting, and his motivations feel flimsy. While he may be sympathetic in a sense, it's a cheap kind of sympathy. He feels like a villain who is there merely to be a villain for Spider-man, with little in the way of actually being a meaningful character. Paul Giamatti makes two very brief appearances, and his character feels like little more than a nod to a future film that will probably, hopefully be much better. <br/><br/>The story itself isn't terribly interesting either. It's the same kind of inner conflict stuff we've seen in most other comic book films, but in particular, we've already crossed this territory. While Stone makes for a much better love interest as Gwen Stacy, it's still the same tried and true story of Peter Parker having to juggle his real life and his love for Gwen and his role as Spider-man and the danger that brings. I will give the film props for a twist at the end of the film that I think is a somewhat brave and unique thing to do in a comic book film, but it's one plot point in many other retreads that we've already seen. And the stuff involving Peter's parents still isn't all that interesting. It's a nice attempt to add changes to Peter's origin, but they're just not that interesting, which is too bad considering how much of Peter's inner struggle comes from that.<br/><br/>This outing of Spider-man feels much like the first: uninteresting villains, needless changes to the origin story, action that, while decent, fails to be really memorable. The biggest problem here is that it feels like the middle part of a bigger story. We've seen this with films like Iron Man 2, but there is no backing here with a larger cinematic universe. Instead, we just have to hope and wait for a better Spider-man movie to come."
"m-joffroy92","4","21","45","18 April 2014"," Disappointed. Truly.
","I don't know why everyone seems to be showering this film with praise. Having been a Spider-Man fan from I was a child, and thoroughly enjoying the original Amazing Spider-Man, I was eagerly anticipating this title. <br/><br/>We are initially hit with some standard Spidey action, and some mind- blowing special effects, in a visually stunning and typically sarcastic intro. There is some cheesiness to be taken with the beginning but this won't bother any self-respecting Spider-Man fan. At this point I was expecting more of the same throughout, cleverly broken up by Peter Parker and Gwen's story in order to add an element of realism and something for the female audience... <br/><br/>Sadly, it was too much of this and too little of that for me. I spent the entire first hour and a half (that might even be generous) wondering when Spider-Man was going to have his first proper fight scene. Too often I found myself watching Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone going around in circles in their ""complicated"" relationship. A touch of the real is nice but when it's this overwhelming in a film that you'd expect to be pretty action packed, it really just wastes time, regardless of how good the chemistry on screen is.<br/><br/>That is my biggest criticism of the film, the fact that it would probably be more accurately titled if it was called ""The Amazing Peter Parker"". However it is not the only flaw. They clearly were not confident enough in Electro as the main villain, considering there is a Harry Osborne/Green Goblin sub-plot. I really do believe that one or the other would have sufficed, with not enough time dedicated to either of the main villains. I think that in terms of screen time, both villains were short lived. The transition from Max Dillon to Electro was fairly quick and we don't see enough of him in action between the first and last encounter with Spider-man. That said, watching him at his best was entertaining, and the combination of incredible effects and a bit of slow-mo in the final face-off was satisfying, if too short and a tad too easy for Spider-man. <br/><br/>The Goblin sub plot had even less time dedicated to it and while I feel that it was in preparation for the third film, I also feel that it was a poor attempt at making Spider-man's life that little bit harder. In my opinion the primary focus should have been on Electro's development as a villain, ultimately leading to Spider-Man having ONE seriously powerful enemy to dispose of. This aside however, I do feel they are building towards a sinister six film and so the inclusion of Harry Osborne is likely crucial going forward.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film felt as though it focused too much on the love story, for reasons that become obvious, but it was lacking in everything you'd want to see in a Spider-Man film. The action is good, the effects are unbelievable as expected but the balance is not right. Too much realism and too little spidey is a bad combination, here's hoping the third instalment doesn't dwell so much on The Amazing Spider-mans relationship difficulties. Disappointing, all in all."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","21","45","16 April 2014"," It's complicated...
","Never being a fan of the Raimi films, I was amazed how much I liked the first TASM film. It improved greatly on the original cheesetastic first film, and this one continues with that, providing an improved sequel to the original trilogy's (overrated, in my opinion) second film. I'm still preferring Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker/Spider-Man to Maguire's. Yes, this Spider-Man cracks jokes (that are at least actually *funny*), but he's also a likable person who's not so full of himself. He's got his heroic side, but also believable flaws. And thank heavens we're not hit over the head with anvils about how sucky his life is like in SM2. His relationship with Gwen Stacy is still one of the best aspects of these new films. Thanks, in large part, to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's effortless chemistry, they make the relationship between their characters so easily likable, whereas with Maguire and Kirsten Dunst...did anybody actually LIKE them together? Another improvement over Dunst's eternal damsel in distress is that Stone's Gwen is actually *helpful* to Spider-Man. Like in the first film, she saves his butt just as much as he saves hers, makes her own choices and doesn't allow him to make them FOR her, further proving why she's such an awesome love interest...which makes what happens near the end all the more powerful. Yes, that big thing concerning Gwen Stacy? It happens, and it's every bit as effective as you'd hope it would be. There's more tragedy packed into that moment than the original films had combined. Although this brutal event sees the end of two of the new franchise's biggest assets (Stone and the Peter/Gwen relationship), it proves too much of an important moment to have gone any other way.<br/><br/>The other big casting benefit is Dane DeHaan, who takes over from James Franco as Peter's old friend Harry Osborn. Although he's only introduced in this film, he and Garfield manage to make their character's history/friendship more believable than Maguire and Franco ever did. There's an easy back and forth between these two, and despite having only a few scenes together, you buy them as old friends. Even Harry's change into the Green Goblin is better handled here. It's not due to a misunderstanding about his father's death or regaining memories after a bump on the noggin that leads him to becoming bad, it's due to his need to save himself and Spider-Man's unwillingness to go along with it. As it turns out, Peter was right not to grant Harry's wish, as once he does get what he wants, he goes from being already kinda creepy-looking to downright impish. Unlike Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn, there's no costume that looks purchased from a toy store here. This time, we have an actual menacing-looking villain (that, granted, looks a bit like a homicidal leprechaun, but still...an improvement over the last Green Goblin incarnation). His physical transformation is truly horrific in how it's presented. He becomes this ghastly creature and proves to live up to the infamy as Spider-Man's greatest enemy. <br/><br/>Somewhat less effective is Jamie Foxx as gap-toothed Max Dillon. He seems a good-natured enough guy (albeit with occasional violent internal feelings), who appears to be as big a fanboy of Spider-Man as they come. However, one lab accident later involving electric eels and something as simple as his hero forgetting his name for a minute sets him off. Perhaps time would've been better spent more on showing how he went from fanboy to enemy, and less on his nerdiness or ability to create Dubstep on the soundtrack. Is it simply because he NEEDS electricity that he goes all crazy, or is becoming Electro such an ego trip that it causes him to go off the deep end? Foxx is quite good as Max pre-Electro (as much as an adult behaving like he does CAN be), but it feels like a little more motivation was required for Electro. At least he provides some stunning visuals/epic battle scenes with Spider-Man, who (unlike a so-called 'Man of Steel') goes out of his way to save the lives of innocent people when crap is being destroyed in Times Square. <br/><br/>Although I found Sally Field's Aunt May to be an improvement over the last one, those who didn't will be happy to hear she shares some emotional scenes with Garfield's Peter here, which proves she can do more than just nag (although, when she does, it's actually quite amusing). Chris Cooper is only in one scene as the dying Norman Osborn, but he does a lot with a little and we get his history with Harry without resorting to anvils (no screaming ""Avenge me!!!"" here, thankfully). Felicity Jones as Felicia Hardy also makes the most of what little screen time she has, managing to make her character mysterious/intriguing, with (hopefully) the promise of seeing more of her next time. The film's thrilling opening scene shows what happened to Peter's parents/how important they are to this new trilogy's overarching storyline. The only WTF casting is Paul Giamatti's hammy Russian mobster, Aleksei Sytsevich, who has two brief scenes: an opening car chase and the end, where he pilots a Rhino-shaped armoured suit. He does feel a bit out of place, like a goofy throwback to the original films, but it's far from the ""multiple villains"" stigma there had been an outcry from fans about.<br/><br/>TASM was an above average set-up film, this one proves a worthy sequel and proper groundwork has properly been laid out for the third. The score, the effects, the direction and the acting are all top notch here. This film shows the consequences of the life Peter leads, but it's not all doom and gloom. There's good humour sprinkled throughout, it's not as overstuffed as people had feared, and we even got a mid-credits scene setting up X-Men: Days of Future Past. Hey, bonus Jennifer Lawrence is always a plus in my book."

Peter Parker then does the cliché sequence of being a depressing douche and contemplating whether to go out and fight the baddies, obviously he does fight the baddie, this baddie being the highly anticipated rhino. There is literally a pathetically short battle, one which leaves a sour taste in the viewers mouth, wondering ""Is that the end? That can't be the end"""

","So, the first 90 minutes were typical. I did continue to capture how angsty spidey seems in the comics. however...it was cliché after cliché...loosely connected plot point to loosely connected plot point.<br/><br/>that is until the last 20 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Harry shows up, figures out spidey is peter, steals Gwen away...peter catches up to save gwen, only he was (cliche) too late.<br/><br/>The cry scene by spiderman at the loss of gwen was really good, seriously moving. The subsequent drama surrounding spiderman giving up because of his guilt, the world going to crap, his Aunt verbally chastizes him for letting his self go...he mustards up the courage to try, re-enter spiderman! <br/><br/>Time and time again superhero movies are ruined by under appreciating the complexity of character.<br/><br/>Dear marvel....aka Disney, you wanna re-stoke the fires of superhero worship...give villains their own 1 hour movies to become villains.

","The story and plot had potential that was not completely realized. The action was good - 8 - liked the POV/First person shots and camera moves. The acting was modest - 6.5. The character's dialogue was pretty good most of the time, witty, sharp - 7 but when it failed it was a 2, and it failed at critical times. The dialogue (and acting) really fell short during the dramatic emotional scenes. A lot of close-ups and teary-eyed emotional scenes that hit the same note and seemed trite. The characters said exactly what they thought, spilling their guts with no subtlety -- dialogue was too head on. The characters ultimately came off as shallow. The story got long and seemed to wander at the end becoming as much about setting up the next movie as satisfying it's potential. More time could have been spent making the characters compelling. It was soap opera acting/dialogue/story with top-shelf Hollywood special effects. Not enough for me."

","A huge step up from the first ""The Amazing Spiderman"". The movie's visuals are stunning, and have some of the best fight scenes I personally have seen in a very long time. The relationship between Parker and Stacy is spectacular and is a driving force in the movie. Story did feel a little convoluted at times, and i would've also liked the movie to focus on itself rather than what is to come in the future. Electro and Harry play pivotal roles in the film and neither characters fail to deliver in their respective villainous parts. Though i did feel as though Harry was the main antagonist instead of electro, but i digress. The Amazing Spiderman is a thrilling, awe striking and gripping film which takes Peter and throws him on the pan of many troubles. Despite the minor problems i have with this film the film is unarguably an epic installment to the Spiderman franchise."
"adamtrz","7","16","34","2 June 2014"," Great Romance Flick, Not the Greatest Action Film
","Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie but something was missing to make it the ultimate Spidey movie (and it was definitely not an absence of Sony product placement). First off I would like to congratulate Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield's on-screen chemistry. It was to say the least adorable and true, which is what made this movie a great romance flick rather than an action film that we all paid to see.<br/><br/>Garfield's portrayal of the loud mouthed web head we all know and love was a huge step up from the first of the series (which is saying a lot as I'm a sucker for origin stories). The perfect balance of cocky script writing and believable teenage actions made for a great portrayal of Peter Parker and allowed for a fun movie experience. I loved the new suit which paid homage to the old comics which was a nice treat for all you spiderfans out there and ultimately it made the fight scenes seem almost 'too comic' but who's to say that's a bad thing anyway. As for the new 'Baddies', they where good, but not great. I will run through each of them and give my opinions on each;<br/><br/>Electro~~ The CGI was fantastic! Despite the original worry that they cast a black actor to play an originally white character Jamie Foxx pulled it and played a very convincing villain. I say villain because his portrayal of the innocent Max Dillon was strange, but kind of good in retrospect.<br/><br/>Harry Osborne~~ Although my first impressions of the pictures released where negative, after watching his portrayal of the conflicted and isolated millionaire kid I would say his performance was on par to that of Garfield himself. He made me think, he made me worry and at one point he even made me hate the web-slinger.<br/><br/>Rhino~~ For me, Rhino was just there rather than part of the 'enemies unite' team. His character lacked development and in terms of story he just jumped from one to another without really any backing<br/><br/>For a fan of Spider-man in both mediums of comic and cinema this movie was not perfect but it did not disappoint either, it's 100% worth the watch and is the best of the spider-man movies yet. 8.4 stars out of 10"
"HimanshuSharma","4","16","34","6 May 2014"," THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2: Overdressed Dish
","Last one was 6/10 and this one's a 4 so Mark Webb has notched up a total score which Raimi did in Spider-man 2 alone. I have seen worse superhero movies but in an era where these are a rare sight, this one's a first. The untold story which was to be told in the first movie is not at all earth shattering until it has some major implications in the future movies. So many cheesy one-liners that for once I thought it was 1997 & I was watching Batman and Robin though there were some scenes which were genuinely funny. With this movie, Mark Webb has proved that superhero movies can be all about love and that is not a compliment. He has ruined my favorite Marvel Superhero. He should stick to 500 Days of Summer material. I, for one, am very happy that he's leaving after the third movie but I'm also afraid that he has run this one so far into the ground that it kind of makes me skeptical about the third. What I do know is that there will be a long mourning period in it. Coming to the villains which were wasted, all three of them. A villain should be purpose driven and I failed to find any in Electro. What surprised me was how he took no time to take control over his powers including flight. Dane DeHaan's acting was ridiculous initially but later he got his grips on the role. The Green Goblin was very good but it was too little and too late. Andrew Garfield and Sally Field's performances were good and that's about the only thing good about this movie. Now the CGI - What else do you expect in an age where almost everything is being produced graphically and looks life like. To put it in a way - Michael Bay's movies have some of the finest detailed CGIs but does that make him a good director? The slow motion 360-degree panorama Spider-Sense is good but if you do that with every fast-actioned sequence then Mr. Webb you are just increasing the runtime of your movie like we used to fill up pages with irrelevant materials in our reports just so that looks nice and fat. If anyone has noticed it, the power grids were having sound equalizer effects on them for the background music when Spidey and Electro were facing off at the grid - Lame and stupid. The Runtime - Characteristic of a good movie is that you don't realize how quickly time flies by but here I was constantly looking over my watch waiting for the movie to end. The Dark Knight Rises was 165 minutes and I didn't want it to end but this 142 minutes felt like eons because Mark Webb has given such unnecessary attention to finer things that the big picture was completely forgotten. Peter's web shooter getting fried and him toying with different batteries and then Gwen and Peter fighting over who did their 8th standard studies better and Peter and Gwen breaking and making up n times and on and on. All this time wasted could have been focused on character building. And yet again some critical looking scenes from the trailers are not in the movie. What goes on in Mark Webb's mind? I bet he has shot 2 completely entire movies."
"son-scott-andrew","4","12","24","3 May 2014"," The amazing spider man was not so amazing.
","Being a big Tobey Maguire I had my doubts with the first movie, but I really enjoyed how Andrew Garfield had portrayed him in the first as a little cocky smart mouth kid, <br/><br/>BUT, THIS MOVIE WAS NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST of the reboot. With useless scenes that has nothing to do with the movie but add suspense, it was a major let down with all the hype surrounding it. <br/><br/>Like many reviews seen and heard, it was more of a chick flick, than an action comedy with them trying to build emotions to quick for the audience to understand. Feeling that the relationship between Parker and Stacy was to quick to add into just one movie. This left me with no connection to the actual characters themselves, feeling that the change in them was rather to quick for the connection to be made.<br/><br/>I know the movie was to be entertaining with all the puns and comments everyone made, but you can fill a movie with so much before it starts to get old, and trust me it got old real quick.<br/><br/>Another point is the lack of character development outside Parker and Stacy, The interaction between other characters left me without any means to fully understand why Jamie fox would want to kill anyone. Sure it showed a little but there could have been more to add to his story, same with Harry Osborn.<br/><br/>All in all the movie had some entertaining value but for the amount of time the movie took to watch, i saw nothing that could add to future sequels seeing as the movies lack and development between anyone."

","Contrary to many negative reviews for the first Amazing Spiderman movie, I liked it because of it's simplistic nature. The second one is a poor follow up. It is an example of what you get when you try to cram a lot of villains without a powerful plot. <br/><br/>Electro's character building was not grasping enough to make him a fearful villain. The green goblin was a peck on the cheek! And Rhino was the gush of air before peck on the cheek! What were you guys thinking when you added them? The only savior was Peter's personal life. The short story of Peter's dad and Peter's love life were the reason this movie gets a 6 from my end."

Sloppy and meandering script could potentially be redeemed by a cast of this caliber, but there's too many characters, an infuriatingly unfocused narrative, and the director's attempt to stage big, grand action sequences is mediocre at best. Shows signs of life as it nears its conclusion, but up until then it goes in so many different directions that it's difficult to take any true enjoyment from it. Overlong, overwritten, and overdone, making this one of the more forgettable Marvel products. **"

"rid-diego","9","31","74","9 May 2014"," Best Spidey film so far!
","First of all, I want to say that I never was a fan of the older movies. The first Spider-Man came out when I was 11 so I said to myself that was the best movie ever. When number 2 came out, I was sorely disappointed so you could imagine my expression when I learned people thought that was the best superhero movie ever (the less we say about SM3, the better). It was a movie that showed that its director, Mr. Sam Raimi, loved the character and the mythology but the script failed in many different ways (that I will not summarize for this being the space for another movie). Maybe it applied when it premiered in 2004 but not anymore. And, sadly, that is what diminishes the impact of this new Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The first Amazing Spider-Man can be accused of being a remake of Raimi's and with some reason. But, luckily, sits among the good ones. Fortunately, this sequel throws everything away to become it's own beast. And, boy, what a beast! Successfully avoiding the curse for ""too many villains"" and being lighthearted fun in it's action sequences without being campy (I only can think of one character that fails in this but still can't really understand there are critics comparing this with Batman & Robin) it still manages to tell a heartwarming (and, eventually, heartbreaking) love story, wrap up plot threads established in the first film and present interesting villains with compelling arcs on their own. And, even with all this, Webb manages to find time to establish the new Spider-Man cinematic universe to come.<br/><br/>Rushed at places? Maybe. Scenes that didn't survive the cutting room? More than likely. And, even knowing how it would end (thanks to a spoilery ""spoiler-free"" review I read in a magazine), it still packed the same punch. That is a testament to the storytelling skills of its director and screenwriters (the underrated Kurtzman/Orci duo alongside Jeff Pinkner of Fringe fame), and also of its actors: Garfield, the definite Spidey to whom every future Spidey would be measured against; the lovely Emma Stone, who delivers a great female companion to the hero, and Dane DeHaan as a, at the same time, endearing and frightening Harry Osborn. <br/><br/>In a world where you have The Dark Knight and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not the best superhero movie of all time. But it is a great time at the movies and the best Spider- Man movie so far.<br/><br/>Rating: A=9.5/10"
"agoodfella","5","19","42","23 July 2014"," The Not So Amazing Spider-Man
","TASM2 has had a number of things going against it, namely: <br/><br/>1) The bar has been set very high indeed for Super Hero films -- esp. the Dark Knight Trilogy, Avengers, Cap, Iron Man and X-Men DoFP have all been on average fantastic. It's great for comic book lovers like most of are. Not so great for film directors and producers that don't really bring their A game.<br/><br/>2) The plot is extremely unoriginal and very derivative -- for a refresher on a fantastic re-boot, re-watch Batman Begins. Or 007 re-boot Casino Royale with Craig James. When I saw that for the first time, I was like ""what the heck... is this James Bond? This is absolutely fantastic!"" It hits you right between the eyes. Does anyone get that sense from watching the TASM / TASM2 films? Not I.<br/><br/>3) The villains (i.e Electro and GG) not only looked ridiculous, the dialog was uninspired and the costumes looked liked they were made from someone who had never read a comic book. Rhino was embarrassingly bad. Really.<br/><br/>4) But, the main thing the TASM series has going against it is, frankly, Andrew Garfield. I don't think he's a bad actor. He was miscast, that's not his fault I guess. But he isn't a convincing Peter Parker. He's too old, he's too lanky and too depressing. Spidey / Parker, if nothing else, is bursting with personality with an amazing sense of humor, and he's gutsy -- I'd argue that only Captain America rivals Spidey's level of bravery / courage. As Parker, he has everything going against him -- loner nerd, has to hustle part-time job -- but I think deep down that's why comic book fans love and identify with Peter -- because WE could be Parker, hence, WE could be Spidey. That's why we root for Spidey. At least that's why I do. <br/><br/>And I didn't feel an ounce of that from TASM2, and I have no interest in seeing TASM3 knowing we will get more of the same."

The Trailer was so Promising that it will turn out good and the fights are A lot which they are NOT. The movie is long for no reason and the fights in it like 3 fights maximum. The movie or the story could have been saved. It started well , got lost in the middle and then ended real bad. A lot of missing things that needed to be explained. Why in hell they keep making Spider- Man a silly cheesy character. Yes he is Goofy , inexperienced and young but why make him a silly character , he is a genius after all. Why put unnecessary stupid scenes in it. There are two scenes that are actually great ( One of them is the first fight against electro )and that's it. The only one who made a great job and all the effort is The Legendary Hans Zimmer ( Composer of TDK Trilogy and MOS ). Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were OK. Jamie Fox tried his best but they made his Character ( Electro ) with no mission but one ( Kill Spider-Man ). Dane Dehaan acted decently but they didn't give his Character ( The Green Goblin Jr ) a chance or a bigger role. This Movie is a disgrace."

The script was funny and heartbreaking, and I left this movie with mixed emotions.<br/><br/>I have no idea if this is just me, but once I got home and really thought about this movie I felt really depressed after the events in the movies. One particular scene, which I'm not going to spoil, everything about it was devastating and heartbreaking, I was on the verge of tears. Thats what makes a good movie, scenes like that where you just feel so deeply for the characters and you want them to win. If you've seen the last movie and you liked it, you're going to love this movie.

"jmiddlehurst","3","31","75","27 April 2014"," A horrible mess
","This Contains Spoilers <br/><br/>I don't normally write reviews but I just wrote a message to my friend and I didn't want to waste my words. <br/><br/>The start annoyed me for two reasons. First, the internet connection on a plane in the late 90's and second the fact it wasn't linked to the Avengers universe. I know this is not Sony's Fault but still annoyed me. I just kept thinking I wish Spiderman was failed experiment of the super-soldier programme like Hulk. And Oscorpe were competing with Stark Enterprises i.e. Rhino's mech-suit for military contracts would be decent. <br/><br/>The films started off with a sadish start with the death of Peters Parents-,And then came the campy Paul Giamatti. Has anyone ever in the history of Cinema been less threatening? Even the corpse of Bambi's mom had menacing hooves. So the film went from sad drama to campy. I felt that was a bit jarring. Peter should have been battered wreak, when he got to the graduation but he was perfectly fine.<br/><br/>Then 2 years pass which felt like 2 seconds. During this time Spiderman, like a stalker has been following Gwen Stacy to a Korean meat ball place (What are Korean meat balls?)- yet she doesn't think it's creepy she thinks it's enduring. I've got news for the writers there's not a girl in the world who likes to be stalked. <br/><br/>In between the stalking – Max Dillion the most socially awkward man in history just doesn't wait to get in the next elevator to go home instead tries to fix the electrics even though. He clearly is an electrical or structural engineer of some kind who works in RnD and not an electrician. Anyway Max Dillion now has the ability to turn in to electricity, travel through power lines etc yet he cannot zap Spiderman or even injure him. Oh wait Electro can be stopped by a simple water hoes.<br/><br/>Some time passes Peter Parker finds a forgotten underground railway, hits a wall and a train pops out of the ground. The perfect internet connection from the early 2000's has been uploaded to this underground train which seems to be in perfect working order and why shouldn't it be? In the train Peter Parker's dad tells Peter he loves him from the grave and only his unique DNA will accept a modified spider bite.<br/><br/>All is forgotten about Peter's mom. She wasn't a scientist so who cares.<br/><br/>At this point Harry Osborn is brooding, desperately wanting Spiderman's blood even though he has a least 20 years left and he is the CEO of a massive military technology company that deals with mutating people. <br/><br/>After being kicked out of Oscorp because he couldn't break into his own company, Harry thinks, I know I'll go to a heavily guarded Arkam Asylum rip-off to rescue Eletro. He ironically uses a teaser. In Arkham there is campy character number 4 DR. Kafka - couldn't they think of a more original name?<br/><br/>I hope you're following this so far there has been bad 4 bad guys, campy Russian (Socially awkward and campy Electro) geeky gorky Harry and evil Nazi scientist Kafka. <br/><br/>Then people start fighting, to that horrible dub-step sound track. <br/><br/>But it's OK Spiderman has a battery to save the day and defeat the enemies. <br/><br/>Oh yeah 2 hours have passed remember this guy it's the Russian, I am Rhino!<br/><br/>The End<br/><br/>There were few positive Dane DeHaan is excellent as are the leads. But for me the change of tone and sloppy plot was hard take. I could never connected to the characters or laughed at the jokes. Too many aspects of the movie felt odd or forced. There were a couple of scenes I felt were just awful and I didn't understand what was happening. I didn't personally felt bored and hoped the movie would end. For me it had a feel of Batman and Robin, I am sure kids will love it but I personally hated The not so Amazing Spiderman."

Jamie Foxx starts to give an electrifying performance but we never really understand his hatred of Spiderman.

This one will leave you asking for more. I love Emma Stone, but there was too much of the love story and not enough everything else. Jamie Foxx plays a formidable villain who you start out feeling sorry for but quickly turns into a jerk who you would not miss if he was destroyed.

"FilmMuscle","3","15","32","3 May 2014"," This Rebooted Franchise Just Gets Hammier As It Goes
","Frankly, watching the new Spider-Man movies made me miss Sam Raimi's original trilogy that much more—yes, even Spider-Man 3 (actually not even a hater of that movie like most people on the ""cool"" or comic-book train). This rebooted series has plenty of flaws and is markedly lacking in so many aspects that it often gets awkward and groan- inducing, including Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker. I preferred Tobey Maguire's Parker simply because he was much more relatable, sympathetic, likable—you know? This one is a cocky lady-charmer with a slew of cheesy jokes. Nope, as far as I know about the original Peter Parker from the comics, he was always a geek who eventually donned the bright outfit and took on the role as a ""friendly neighborhood"" and hero. We are far removed from that image with Marc Webb's rendition. Personally, though, it's definitely more fun to write a negative review than a positive one (I feel like there's so much more things to say) so the film did give me that pleasure. Ouch! <br/><br/>Anyway, the mystery behind the sudden disappearance/deaths of Parker's parents continues from the first installment, and we're actually presented with much more depth into the arc this time around. In addition, Peter Parker is still attempting to somehow address Gwen Stacy's and his relationship after the death of her father and the promise he made Parker keep. Lots of drama already, and then—boom—a plethora of villains because we obviously didn't have enough story to cover. First, we get Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) who actually benefits from an intriguing set-up/origin story as a nerdy, awkward Spider-Man fanatic; that was fun. However, once we witness his transition into his villainous role as Electro, things start to get hammy and ridiculous with never the slightest hint of believability or proper development. There's never a scene that explains how he suddenly turned from a shy, humble Oscorp employee into a menacing, destructive baddie. ""I AM ELECTRO!"" Yes, he actually said that in the movieIn a significantly smaller part, Paul Giamatti horribly portrays the rhino, and yes, he too laughably exclaims ""I am the Rhino!"" at one point in the film, as well as carries a terrible Russian accent (I guess that's apparently what that babble/gibberish was supposed to be). Cringe- worthy, I know! Just like the rest of the flick's dialogue. <br/><br/>And finally, we have Peter's dear friend, Harry Osborn, who of course turns into the Green Goblin, and actually, in comparison to the rest of the ""super-evil"" characters, he was fine. Now, Dane DeHaan, for some reason, thought that putting on a forced, deep and maniacal-like voice was going to sound convincing or make him sound more like a typical teenagerit didn't work. Usually, I'm a huge fan of DeHaan's work (from Chronicle to Kill Your Darlings), but this performance really disappointed, and like the rest of the film, was quite over-the-top. Most importantly and what I briefly mentioned above, the dialogue just can't be taken seriously. <br/><br/>The conversations frequently make you cringe as far down as you can get into your seat, and the actors clearly think that stumbling with your lines and repeating the same word makes for fine acting. In essence, almost everything in this film feels forced and unnatural, and I don't know if Webb was going for a truly comic-booky superhero movie. If so, it really worked but not in a good way. The film is so confident that it abandons any sense of being grounded and just goes all out. Screw logic and have this guy burst with electricity, and yup, he gets even more powerful with the more electricity he consumes. If you're a comic- book fanboy, you might be biased into not minding these sorts of elements, but as a pure fan of films, it honestly was difficult to stomach. <br/><br/>Shall we get to the movie's soundtrack too? You know it's a 2014 Spider-Man movie when you hear dubstep and hip electronic music playing in the background. Did we see any of that in the original trilogy? No because it wasn't necessary, and it also wasn't popular back then. Moreover, there's a scene that unnecessarily begins playing a pop/country song that makes it feel more like a music video than an authentically-edited search for information on his dad's death. Last but not least, in comparison to the original films, The Amazing Spider- Man 2 is undoubtedly geared towards younger audiences with its inclusion of extremely kiddy humor that only saw laughter from—who else?—the little kids in the movie theater. I thought Spider-Man was excessive with his use of jokes but, at least, witty ones. <br/><br/>So, I practically drove everything this movie offered into the ground with this review, but don't get mad at me yet, Spider-Man fans, because— at least—the movie gained from the chemistry Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone share on-screen as the couple. On another note, the filmmakers actually pulled off a considerable risk towards the end by—*gasp*— killing off a character (like they did with its predecessor), which is certainly more than Marvel Studios could ever do with their properties in their magical worlds of miraculous revivals and recoveries. Furthermore, we do get some exciting action sequences and thankfully, Spider-Man faces off against his threatening foes a few times throughout the narrative instead of just an immediate final showdown that an abundance of similar movies mistakenly feature. <br/><br/>In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't the worst of superhero movies. Actually, it's a little better than its forerunner and even more enjoyable than some of Marvel's recent films, but when compared to the classic superhero movies that Sam Raimi graced onto screens, the X- Men franchise, and—duh—Nolan's Batman films, this new Spider-Man story hardly warrants the franchise's quick resurrection."
"damonous","4","13","27","4 May 2014"," It was the Best of Spidey's; it was (almost) the Worst of Spidey's
","Here we are again: I wrote a similar headline for the similarly-frustrating Skyfall a couple of years ago. I didn't expect to find another overlong, hopelessly uneven movie I had such high hopes for this soon. Maybe I shouldn't say ""high"" hopes: I had my fears going-in based upon the trailers and the abundance of villains, so my expectations were pretty well-metered before the opening scene. TASM2 is, at the end of the day, a fairly punishing, draining watch. Unlike the stellar Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which precedes it by just a couple of weeks and had me instantly wanting to see it again as the credits closed, TASM2 left me dreading the thought of ever sitting through it again...DURING the big battle scene in the final quarter of the film.<br/><br/>Was it ever as bad as Sam Raimi's King of All Bad Superhero Movies, Spider-man 3? Thankfully, no. I WOULD watch this again any day over that fine mess. But TASM2 is just so up-and-down, yo-yo, through-and-through. There are so many great action sequences & web-slinging rides through the city, which really make IMAX 3D the only way to see this (if you're not going to heed my warnings). There are absolutely wonderful Spidey quips & small heroic touches ripped out of the comic pages just for you (I wont spoil these gems; they're part of the ""best of Spidey's I refer to). The interaction between Garfield & Stone as Peter Parker & Gwen Stacey is even better than the first TASM, and really seals their great love affair with a silly smile on your face. Also, I enjoyed the briefly-played, but well thought-out friendship between Parker and Harry Osbourne. Dane DeHaan gives a great performance (at least, before he rather abruptly transforms).<br/><br/>But, amidst all that, we get the lamest villain origin in Electro since Jim Carrey as The Riddler in Batman Forever. Why did Jamie Foxx have to play Max Dillon as a total societal outcast, complete with overstuffed pocket-protector? And, considering how sleek everyone else who works at Oscorp is, how in the world did he ever get hired? If he's as intelligent as they make him out to be in very short, broad strokes, why is he ultimately such a painful imbecile? Add that dreadful portrayal to the big fight scene at the end, in a location apparently impervious to damage. Spidey swings his way to it in a few minutes with ease, but another character is able to DRIVE there through a city in a blackout gridlock in what would have to be comparatively LESS time. Immediately, you are able to sense the sucker punches to come as some of the absolute worst of plot-contrivances.<br/><br/>Some people are commenting that Giamotti as The Rhino is the most interesting villain in the film, for all of his very brief scenes. I was not that enthralled, since his performance is so way over-the-top. But, it does showcase an element which consistently makes Sony & Fox & most DC films bad, whereas Disney Marvel & Christopher Nolan Batman films consistently shine: Rhino is a real villain. He likes to steal, has no shame in it, and he's just a bad dude.<br/><br/>I challenge you to name a single other Spider-Man movie villain (from ANY of the five films) that isn't 'reluctant' or a victim of unfortunate circumstance. From Iron Man to Thor to Captain America to The Avengers, Disney Marvel films are unafraid to depict REALLY BAD GUYS. No apologies. They might be multi-layered, but that comes more from their general (twisted) belief structure, and less because life just handed them a raw deal.<br/><br/>TAMS2 sets up a lot of threads for more big-name villains in the next installments. Here's hoping we get at least one with a character who with full knowledge and with no regrets, decides to 'don the evil'; because the ""villain takes unadvised serum or makes unadvised mistake""-routine is way last its prime in the Spidey films."

"khanbaliq2","7","18","40","28 April 2014"," The Shabby Spider-Man 2
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is more of the same from director Marc Webb. It's a good thing that I didn't pay to see it. Because of the film's marketing campaign and the trailers I was, for some time, looking forward to seeing this sequel. But what I saw was almost as bland and unengaging as The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). As was the case with the first film, the trailers for the sequel made it seem much better than it actually is. It's a cheat in a way. One of the three supervillains in the trailers isn't even an important character in the film. All the action scenes in the film were featured in the trailers. Yes, there's a shortage of action. The actions scenes are few and far between. There's also nothing particularly impressive about them. Director Sam Raimi did the same thing a decade earlier and he did it much better. In addition he made the action scenes lengthy, something that Webb still isn't capable of doing. But Webb's inexperience (or is it a lack of talent?) is evident not only in the action. It's evident in the way he directs actors. We've heard enough about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone being a couple. But does this make a difference in the film? It makes little difference really. The featured romance is typical for a superhero film. It makes you feel little for the couple, something that becomes much too obvious during an important scene. The screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner doesn't impress. At times it's poorly written. It doesn't help the romance or the proceedings. It doesn't make the characters interesting. It's formulaic. It contains unnecessary parts. These parts are a burden on the film's running time, which is 2 hours and 22 minutes. Yet we still get two underdeveloped and unmemorable supervillains. We get to know their motivations but we don't really get to know anything else about them. This is a fault of the screenplay. Jamie Foxx (Electro) and Dane DeHaan (Green Goblin) don't provide good performances with Webb's direction. In fact, the performances and even the film itself seem cartoonish at times. Also, for a film with such a large budget ($255 million), the CGI looks surprisingly underdeveloped in some scenes. There's just a lack of style in these Spider-Man movies by Marc Webb. If it wasn't for Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker it would have been a chore to sit through this film. It's not all bad though. Sometimes the actors manage to brighten up a scene. There are some genuinely funny audience-friendly bits. A good electronic score by Hans Zimmer & The Magnificent Six is a bit of an improvement over James Horner's orchestral score for the first film. But at a time when Marvel and Disney are releasing one solid superhero film after another this aimless Spider-Man reboot by Columbia seems primitive. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is only a minor improvement over the first film. Take my advice and don't see it in a movie theater. Don't get duped for a second time."

"TheSeaLion","2","16","35","2 May 2014"," Another letdown from ""Spider-Man""
","I remember after watching ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" almost two years ago for the first and only time that I hoped the next film in the series would be better. My hopes came true as ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is a little better than its predecessor. After watching the film though, I realized that almost two years ago, I should have hoped the next movie would be good. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is a sequel that learned from the mistakes made the first time, but only corrected a few of those mistakes.<br/><br/>Opening up on a heist conducted by a group of criminals, our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) gives chase and foils the heist in an upbeat scene that suggests the people behind the movie decided to smartly move away from the darker tone a la Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight trilogy"". Spider-Man manages to get to his graduation just in time and ends up breaking up with his girlfriend Gwen (Emma Stone) because he is seeing her deceased father (Denis Leary), whom he promised in the first film that he would keep Gwen out of harm, which he has fluctuated on but this time he is certain with it.<br/><br/>In the meantime, an obsessed fan of Spider-man's who was saved during the heist at the beginning of the movie (Jamie Foxx) is believed dead in an accident that ends up giving him the power to harness electricity. As this happens, Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns to Manhattan, dying from something known as the Osborn curse, and requires Spider-man's blood and its healing capabilities to save his life. <br/><br/>If ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was the Raimi ""Spider-Man"" to this new franchise, than ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" would be the ""Spider-Man 3"" of the new franchise. The film attempts to balance too many story arcs, one dealing with Peter's parents, one dealing with the Peter/Gwen relationship, one for each of the villains, and so on. Each plot is brought up, then something comes up to distract from that plot line to follow another plot line just to pick up the dropped plot line ten to twenty minutes later (you able to follow that?). <br/><br/>The film adds more humor that is suitable for a ""Spider-Man"" film in this one with the darker scenes at the end, but the film is less humorous like like ""Iron Man 3"" and more along the lines of stupid and goofy like ""Spider-Man 3"". Toning down the darker, more realistic tone of the movie was a good move though, because it makes the presence of an electric man that was turned that way by falling into a tank of electric eels more suitable for the world that is being created.<br/><br/>Like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", this film is just set up for the next movie. It ends in a similar fashion, this time with Harry Osborn instead of Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) being met by a man in the shadows (Michael Massee). This time around, Osborn and the man plan to join a number of villains together to defeat Spider-Man, the first being the stereotypical Russian mobster from the opening heist (Paul Giamatti), now being called Rhinoceros. Several of the plot lines including the one about the parents had a loose end to it for the next movie, but at least this time we got to know about them. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone return in their roles as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey, sharing a little chemistry this time around, but still maintaining the lack of interest from the first film. Garfield's Peter Parker does not fluctuate in character as much in this film, this time not having any definitive character traits other than some snappy on- the-spot joking. The only character who stands out is Foxx's Electro until he becomes another villain who is just out for revenge on the hero.<br/><br/>While it is better than ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", ""The Amazing Spider- Man 2"" is a mess of plot lines that are jumbled up and poorly balanced with one another for the sake of setting up sequels. With a weak, and at times stupid, final scene of the film, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" ends on its lowest point, which is what will most likely stick with you after watching this film."
"JMPesce","4","16","35","2 May 2014"," Extremely disappointing; such a shame.
","A group of friends and I were fortunate enough to catch this film at an advanced screening in Toronto last night. Going in, we were moderately excited, but didn't want to overhype the film at all, so we watched it as a standalone film, without wanting to compare it to the other Spider- Man films going in. However, upon further review when I got home, after watching the film, I compared it to its predecessor for quality. <br/><br/>Rarely do sequels surpass their original films, but what ensued was honestly one of the worst filmgoing experiences of my life. Clocking in at 2.5 hours, the movie feels dreadfully long. I found myself periodically checking my watch, only to see that 10 or 15 minutes had passed, when it felt like a half hour at least. <br/><br/>Normally, I enjoy longer movies. My favourite film of all time, Casino, is 3 hours. But that film doesn't feel like 3 hours; it feels like 2 (to me, anyway). Amazing Spider-Man 2 felt closer to 4 hours, and it was mostly because of the shoddy dialogue between the two main leads, the pointless drawn-out romance scenes, Dane DeHaan's acting in general, and Electro's cheesy lines. The one that comes to mind is ""It's my birthday; time to light my candles!"" <br/><br/>Don't get me started on that ridiculous scene on the plane of Richard and Mary Parker, the disastrous shaky cam, and the unlikelihood of uploading a 30 second video while plummeting to your death. Talk about exposition and deus ex machina for future events: Peter is feeling angsty, decides to break his father's stuff, and discovers that in his father's calculator (of all places) were TOKENS from the D-Train he supposedly took to work every day. The D-Train platform was actually a SECRET laboratory where SECRET experiments were going on, SECRETLY. What a bunch of malarkey. <br/><br/>Another problem: Gwen Stacy magically knows how to stop Electro, all of a sudden, and goes along after Peter to ""help"" (upon further consideration afterward, Gwen does this in the first film as well, with the ""antidote"" that she knows about to stop the Lizard-ification of New York). That alone is bad enough because it is unlikely, but the fact that she heard Peter yell when to flip the switch, yards away, through electricity, steel, and plated glass, when she cannot even see anything discernible that would let her know visually that it was permissible to flip the switch was hogwash. Having Gwen there was only a way of setting up her eventual death at the end of the film, and nothing more. <br/><br/>Finally, when Rhino is rampaging right at the end of the film, he stops shooting when Spider-Man and the mini Spider-Man were having a moment. He's a killer isn't he? He's a mobster isn't he? Why would he not shoot at Peter to get rid of him while he's monologuing to the kid? I know that wouldn't happen because Spider-Man can't die in a Spider-Man film, especially not at the end of the film, but it was ridiculous that Rhino would even consider stopping shooting, period. <br/><br/>After watching the film, I went home and compared my experience to watching the first Amazing Spider-Man. TASM was by no means a masterpiece, but it was miles ahead of this film in terms of direction, plot, and dialogue. It is a shame that they wasted such potential on this sequel, and decided to flush it all away with that ghastly end result. Now I understand that a bunch of material was cut from the film, but that should be no excuse. In fact, it was as if they cut the WRONG scenes from the film. The scene where Harry tells Peter he is being watched? Not even mentioned at all. Horrible editing job, the film could have been completely different if those scenes were there. After the editing for the first film and this one, I'm convinced the trailers were deliberately made to bait and switch viewers, because both times different information was presented to be the core point of the film, and both times, the films did not deliver on that front. <br/><br/>Overall, this film was a VERY disappointing experience for the whole group of us. If compelled to score the film, I would have to give it a 4 out of 10, and that's pushing it, mostly because I liked the atmosphere of the film in general. Aside from that aspect, the score would most likely be a 2 or 3 out of 10. <br/><br/>Sorry to disappoint, guys. I can honestly say that this film was definitely not worth the hype Sony gave it. Sony over-pumped the tires, and they popped before they even touched the track."

","Im not going to reveal any spoilers in this review, but I do mention a few things so don't read me if you haven't seen the film yet.<br/><br/>There are a few plot niggles that irritate die-hard comic fans like myself. For example, Spider-man does not get ill, he has a healing factor which is the entire plot point for several of the other characters in the film. He could heal from electric hits in seconds, but is taken out with the common cold?<br/><br/>There were a lot of subplots. From the school graduation, to Aunt Mays new job. The origin of Rhino, Electro, Goblin and several others which are rather easter eggs for those in the know, the Gwen love story, the aftermath of the first film, the death of Several key characters, hallucinations of past characters, moving to another country, the back-story about his parents, the corporate takeover, the Ben parker conspiracy investigation. If you don't pay attention you will miss a lot of exposition. And some of the plots like The conspiracy and London don't add anything to the overall story. They just fizzle out with that strand of the plot apparently ended and deemed no-longer important. <br/><br/>They could have edited a lot more out of the film and you wouldn't have missed anything. Im glad they edited out Mary Jane as there would have been no reason for her to be there. <br/><br/>The action is great, and the special effects superb. At some point though, they have to start equipping the cops with decent weapons since they know the danger levels they are facing and handguns are no-longer appropriate. Also maximum security prisons seem to be stupidly lapse in security. That scene was a joke. Transporting plutonium through a major city and letting it get hijacked by three thugs was also a joke. Where are the spike traps, helicopters, snipers etc. We need our superheroes to do the stuff us normal humans cant do. Not make the humans so stupid that the heroes simple balance out their inadequacies of common sense. <br/><br/>The film is enjoyable viewing that I recommend. But better character motivations, fine- tuning the police to seem competent and eliminating irrelevant plot strands would have been welcomed. I also would have liked to see his injuries carry on to the next fight or day, so we can see what impact that being Spider-man has on his life of Peter Parker. He may have a healing factor, but he's not Wolverine. His scars are suppose to take days to heal, not seconds."

","I rated The Amazing Spider-Man 2 10/10 OK first things first do not pay attention to people who are reviewing this movie. This is the best and when I say the best I mean the best spiderman movie ever. Some people will say it had to many villains well I beg to differ. It may seem like it but it's nothing like how spiderman 3 did it. At least they set it up correctly. I think that's why people didn't like some of it because it's sets up for the 3rd movie and the sinister 6 movie spin off. No character was a throw away in my opinion. The love with peter and Gwen Stacy is great and Andrew is a better spiderman than Tobey Miguire. Everyone in this movie does a great job with the characters. Jamie Foxx as electro is very obsessed in a creepy way and it may come off as Jim Carey in Batman forever but it works. You don't get much time with him in the movie but he serves a purpose and he is menacing as a villain and you start to feel very sorry for him at times. But Harry Osborn played by Dane Dehann is great he may not be a James Franco but he plays green goblin better. And the movie may seem long but never was I bored or unentertained the action is phenomenal and the CGI work was great you should see this in IMAX 3D if you can spend the extra bucks. I'm seeing the same thing that happened with man of steel with this movie. The reviews are low for some odd reason who knows but the movie is epic. The only thing I could think as a negative with this movie is that you don't get much time with the villains but I only think it's because you have to explore the dynamic with peter and Gwen because of what happens at the end which is the most well known comic book thing to ever happen through out comic book history. And it is done well and I won't spoil but comic book people may know what I'm talking about. But other than that this movie was great forget the haters I think it did a way better job than the last amazing spiderman it explored the untold story about peters parents and still more to come with the sinister 6 movie and I can't wait."
"mistercsays1","5","12","25","10 May 2014"," It's Just Another Spiderman Movie
","My last review for a Marvel comic adaptation (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) drew some fire from those upset that I had given too much of the story away. Looking back, such criticisms are probably justified, but the problem I find with films such as these is that there isn't really that much to discuss. As an audience we know what to expect and, as such, there are very few surprises or points of difference on which to centre a review. We know the special effects will be first class, we know our hero will prevail and we know that each release will be out to upstage all those that went before it in terms of spectacle. There is no change to this formula with The Amazing Spiderman 2, the second in the rebooted Spiderman franchise with Mark Webb in the director's chair. If nothing else, Webb is certainly the most appropriately named director to helm such a film and, to his credit, his approach is much lighter in tone.<br/><br/>Devoid of the angst and uncertainty that plagues a character such as Captain America, Spiderman enjoys his place in the spotlight, aping for the cameras that capture his every rescue and ushering witty one-liners as he despatches bad guys to save the day. In his second appearance as Peter Parker and his web slinging alter ego, Andrew Garfield brings a real sense of fun to the character, courtesy of a screenplay from Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner that never takes the character too seriously. The Spiderman theme music as Parker's ringtone is one of many recurring jokes that keep the mood light and embed the character with a sense of self-awareness that makes him much more real, if such a term can ever be used to describe a character of this type. <br/><br/>On this occasion, there are two bad guys baying for Spiderman's blood, quite literally in one case. Whilst the emergence of the Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) follows the very traditional Spiderman narrative arc of a former friend turned against our orphan hero, the other villain of this piece is Electro (Jamie Foxx), a bumbling, mumbling electrical engineer and self-described nobody who suddenly becomes 'somebody' when he suffers a workplace accident that leaves him charged with electricity and capable of manipulating the power grids of New York and potentially electrocuting the entire population. Of course Peter's dead father Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) is always front and centre of proceedings, having developed the science that is the catalyst for much of the maleficence that ultimately leads to the creation of our various villains. Sally Field returns as Peter's long suffering aunt May, who somehow remains oblivious to his arachnidan attributes and, of course, there is the requisite love interest in high school sweetheart Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone).<br/><br/>There is a strong dynamic between Garfield and Stone - well Parker and Stacy at least – that plays like the typical on-again-off-again nature of teenage romances, particularly as they compete with the pressures and expectations that necessarily impinge upon their lives now that they have finished school. In fact, despite being 30 years of age, Garfield effectively assays Peter as a somewhat typical teenage boy, a slacker for the most part, his superhero shenanigans aside. Gwen, on the other hand, is driven and determined to achieve her objective of securing a place at Oxford University, prepared to leave Peter behind if necessary. Whilst this doomed romance is ripped straight from the pages of Romeo and Juliet (as they always are), we never lose sight of the fact that this is, first and foremost, an action film very much targeted at a teenage male audience.<br/><br/>The CGI effects, as we have come to expect, are excellent, although the deliberate flourishes aimed at maximising the 3D experience are somewhat distracting for those of us who watched it in 2D mode. The shots of Spiderman swinging through the streets of New York are always impressive and the neon jungle that is Times Square proves the ideal locale for the showdown between Spiderman and Electro. However, Spiderman is actually much more enjoyable, as a character and a movie experience, when our hero is taking on more 'traditional' villains, such as thugs and thieves. With Felicity Jones and an almost unrecognisable Paul Giamatti also featuring, The Amazing Spiderman 2 is another satisfactory if decidedly unexceptional addition to the ever growing litany of comic book characters on cinema screens."
"haosstoposto","5","12","25","8 May 2014"," Not an exciting movie
","The hardest thing to review is a mediocre movie. Horrible and excellent movies are easy, because the motivation for a review is high. But with modest movies there is nothing special to say about them. It is possible too see them once in a lifetime and forget them immediately. I had some high hopes about this installment of Spiderman and it failed to meet them. The movie itself is in my opinion too long and most of that time was wasted as a filler. There were many new things introduced in the movie but everything seemed rushed and uninspired. We have two new villains, Electro and Green Goblin. The birth of Electro is somewhat funny, because he was bitten by radioactive electric eel (Not radioactive spider, mind you! Eel!). He hates Spiderman, because he used to love him and he got disappointed later. Green Goblin is born when Harry Osborne injects himself with some kind of radioactive spider poison. And we see him on screen for entire five minutes. Spiderman manages to defeat his enemies at the end after a bombastic fight full sound and fury, but at great price. Then we have setting for a new villains in the future, Black Cat and Rhino which seemed ever more rushed then the first two villains (especially Rhino, it's unbelievable how did they introduced him in the end)and we will see what will happen with them in future movies. All in all, a generic uninspired superhero story, more like a prequel for some future blockbusters. Go see it, you will lose only 140 minutes of your life. And you will gain not much."
"ticket_for_one","5","12","25","6 May 2014"," Nowhere near good enough
","Review – A supremely average follow up to The Amazing Spider-Man. Borderline dreadful, compared to it's predecessor. <br/><br/>Performances range from good to awful. Andrew Garfield reprises his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and puts in a good performance as does Emma Stone, whose chemistry with Garfield works well on screen. Dane DeHaan (who is a brilliant new talent) comes across as a tired looking Leonardo DiCaprio impersonator. He has a few good moments with Garfield and a great scene with Chris Cooper (playing a dying Norman Osborne) but his scenes as the Green Goblin are just laughable. Imagine Gollum from the Lord of The Rings, with barely any hair, dehydrated and on some serious crack. That's the Green Goblin you see in this film. A grotesque looking man wearing Oscorp battle armour, instead of the mask wearing insane antagonist we're familiar with. Just a totally rushed villain whose inclusion was only there to please the fan boys.<br/><br/>Then we have Jamie Foxx as Max Dillion/Electro. A super villain with anger issues and low self-esteem. Seriously miscast, and found wanting in every scene he was in. However, making Electro pure electrolysis did work. It's just unfortunate that the character is so annoyingly bad, he becomes immediately forgettable as soon as you leave the cinema. Foxx's performance as the Max Dillon character is reminiscent Jim Carrey's as Edward Nygma in Batman Forever. It was incredibly cheesy and dated.<br/><br/>The narrative is jumbled, the script dire beyond belief and the inclusion of Rhino as an additional villain is a huge mistake. Paul Giamatti (sporting a bald head and Adidas tracksuit) as the Rhino, only has 10 mins worth of screen time. When he finally does don the Rhino suit (near the end of the film) the animatronics for the suit are so bad, the encounter between him and Spider-Man look more like a video game cut scene, rather than a special effects set piece from a 250 million dollar superhero film. This is primarily the reason why this movie fails in my opinion. Terrible inconsistency with regard to the effects that look incredibly choppy in some scenes, good in other parts of the film. The budget for this sequel is a significant increase after the success of the first installment, but on a technical level it's awful. Some scenes almost mirror X-Box One's advert for the Amazing Spider-Man 2 game. Marketing overdrive? Yes I think so.<br/><br/>Lastly the insipid love story we have to endure between Gwen and Peter is another problem. The will she won't she, will he won't he back and forth nonsense becomes so boring and drawn out, I became less invested as the film went on. The overall tone switches from dark superhero to comical kids film like a metronome, and the main story it all hinges on is just a mess.<br/><br/>Overall, Amazing Spider-Man 2 entertains with it's action. Just a shame it's story, shoddy script, boring romance between the two leads and Webb's lacklustre direction make this a bore fest with few thrills.<br/><br/>Disappointed!<br/><br/>ticket-for-one.com"
"pinkled5","5","12","25","4 May 2014"," Muddled Plot and Awkward Dialogue
","First, let me just say that the first 20 minutes of this film are fantastic. We finally get to see the Spider-Man from the comics that not one single movie of either trilogy has shown. I loved that. Then the film went South in a hurry.<br/><br/>The next hour is spent introducing characters, and not in a very convincing way, I might add. Why so much time spent on introductions? Because this movie has more plot lines than spider web has geometric shapes. The plot is so muddled with so many different things and there is nothing tying them all together. There is no central theme, nothing for me as the viewer to grasp on to to carry me from one end of the film to the other. It's really a mess.<br/><br/>The other thing that turned me off was the awkward dialogue. It was poorly introduced and unconvincingly written. For example, there is absolutely no time spent developing the relationship between Peter Parker and Aunt May, but all of a sudden in the middle of the film there's this big emotional breakthrough which is meaningless because it hasn't been set up properly. And many of the exchanges had me putting my face in my hands and groaning.<br/><br/>What's the one redeeming quality of the film? The web slinging. It was the best of any Spider-Man film to date."
"bayisatool","5","12","25","3 May 2014"," just OK...
","This movie is flawed. Even by super hero movie standards this movie is flawed. However I did enjoy this movie more than the 2012 reboot. What I enjoyed about the movie basically boils down to a handful of things. #1 the action. I thought the action set pieces were well done and they actually looked pretty cool for the most part. #2 I really enjoyed some of the music choices that they used in the movie. For example during spider-man's fight with electro they used dub step which I personally really enjoyed. #3 a good chunk of the jokes had me chuckling and some even had me laughing pretty hard. It is unfortunate that for all the things that were done extremely well that there were just as many flaws in the movie. #1 The story was extremely predictable. I mean my brother and I guessed what we thought would happen in the movie just based on what we saw in the trailer and we were spot on. We didn't get a single detail wrong. #2 The whole will they won't they dating game that Peter and Gwen played in the movie felt like a huge waste of time. #3 there was about 30 minutes of film that just felt pointless. Stuff that didn't lead to anything in the movie and took up time that could have been used to develop the villains/ set up other parts of the story. #4 the ending of the film should have taken place earlier in the film. If it had then we could have gotten some real development in spider-man's character. Instead all that ""development"", if you can even call it that it happens so fast on screen, happens in a montage. At the end of the film the list of good and bad things that I noticed in the film were about the same. I recommend that you manage your expectations of the film. If you do I believe that you will enjoy yourself. I give this movie a 5/10"
"h-mathurm","5","12","25","3 May 2014"," Not TOO amazing a movie, I'm afraid.
","The Amazing Spider Man 2 didn't turn out to be what I expected. Yes, the action was there, and so was the excitement, but all this was marred by the presence of exaggerated action, and stupid music (Sorry dubstep lovers).<br/><br/>2 hrs 22 minutes is quite a long time, though it could have been enjoyable , had it not felt like a desperate attempt to extend the story.<br/><br/>The music in this movie, though it tries to get your heart thumping, give it a kind of cheap look. I'm a fan of dubstep too, but trust me, it felt out of place here.<br/><br/>The ending, while preposterous, follows the old comics, so avid fans will already know it. But it will still be shocking for others. Jamie Foxx is an awesome actor, but frankly his role in this movie was idiotic. And I am no fan of Dane DeHaan's acting, which in this movie was visibly overdone and almost poor. <br/><br/>I won't say that the movie was bad, it just wasn't up to the standards of such a massive franchise, and will surely disappoint a lot of people."

","This was the nail in the coffin for me.<br/><br/>Let me say that I LOVE superhero films.

I sensed his touch numerous times.

"jpalfy-89391","10","4","6","31 May 2016"," I loved this movie!
","This movie was freaking fantastic! Andrew Garfield is a perfect actor to play the Spiderman role and they were wrong to replace him for Tom Holland. Andrew could really bring out the true colors and emotions that Peter Parker had and it was an amazing job! The movie is too harshly criticized and there should be an Amazing Spiderman 3 with Andrew Garfield. Though the plots lines are a bit twisted and unique for what would have been the next two movies, the edge that was put into these versions of Spiderman from the three previously played by Toney Maguire. I would much rather watch Andrew Garfield play the wall-crawler than Toney Maguire and Tom Holland combined. I desperately want the movie producers to worry more about the quality of the actor and movie than how much money they're getting. Aren't you rich enough already?! I want Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield to play their original roles of Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker. The duo made the movie that much better. If you were so worried about the actor, why give him the role? Don't change out Andrew Garfield just because Amazing Spiderman 2 made $4 000 000 instead of $10 000 000. Those aren't the exact numbers, but don't fire an amazing actor who plays the role of an iconic superhero perfectly."

","Only one thing gets better in these series - the digital effects. The story goes more awful every time. Personally I don't like movies where the heroes are kids, students (or worst - animals) but here there are more than enough of both. <br/><br/>The whole story of this movie is based on DNA experiments but no science is involved in the scenario - the transformations are explained like simple chemistry - put some DNA in the blood stream and voilà - a spider, a goblin or something more stupid but still that powerful. You'll see it.<br/><br/>From the movie I understood only this - the city has no rules, the ordinary people are not afraid of street gunfights, the police is full of people that only know how to fire a gun and drive a car, no special forces, no FBI, no army. <br/><br/>Spiderman does it all.<br/><br/>Please go and see more smart movies or simply read a book. There is a reason that there are no books for Spiderman with amount of pages like ""LOTR"", ""Game of Thrones"" or even ""Harry Potter""."
"rcolgan","4","10","20","6 May 2014"," Poor plotting and weak characters
","Once again Sony has tightened it's grip on the Spider-man franchise to stop the likes of Disney getting a hold of it and expanded on the amazing spider-man franchise. Unfortunately whilst they may have this power over the character they do not live up to their responsibility to make a decent franchise, instead creating a lack luster film with weak characters, poor designs and an overwhelming lack of a coherent plot structure. <br/><br/>The weak structure largely comes from the fact that the film is stuffed with far too many sub plots with each villain and supporting character seeming to get one leaving little room to develop any of them. But the film's main focus though is on the relationship between Gwen and Peter as after the events of the first film Peter is uncertain about being with Gwen and putting her in danger. At times this relationship is extremely effective, largely due to the natural chemistry of Garfield and Stone which does help the romance work. Unfortunately the romance does suffer from some weaker elements such as when Peter tells Gwen that he's been following her around. This is thought of in the film as romantic, but it's not. It's creepy and makes spider-man a stalker! If someone were following you without your knowing, would you consider it romantic? <br/><br/>Another problem with the love plot taking up the most time it also means we get more Parker than we do Spider-man. This is a problem because just like the first film it seems like Garfield does pretty well as Spider- man, being very funny spouting one liners in the most dire situations, but fails as being Peter Parker, being annoying and awkward on screen. Also the only relationship of meaning that's developed in the film is with Gwen, his interactions with the other characters don't really go anywhere. He doesn't even get that much screen time talking to any of the villains, making there relationships feel fairly genetic and lacking interest. <br/><br/>One of these villains that the film introduces is Electro, who's design looks like a reject from the blue man group. At first the film tries to develop his character and show him as this innocent person who has an obsessive nature, but then in the midpoint of the film deteriorates to a bland ""I am evil now and must kill Spider-man"" with little build up or reason for such a sudden character shift. Also, whilst in the adverts he was hyped to be the main villain, the reality is that he doesn't have much impact at all on the plot. You could have removed his character from the movie and it wouldn't have made any difference whatsoever other than removing some fight scenes. <br/><br/>Then there's Harry Osborne and his alter ego, the Goblin. He has some good scenes early on, particularly one scene where he's talking with his dying father which is probably the best scene in the film, but then he becomes weaker as the film progresses with he film seemingly uncertain as to whether it wants us to sympathise with him due to being alienated by everyone or hate him for attacking evil. Also the relationship between him and Peter feels very unnatural and forced since we don't see them build any relationship to begin with with only one or two lines of dialogue giving any explanation as to why they could be close. <br/><br/>Then to top it off you have rhino. If you thought Venom didn't get enough screen time in spider-man 3, wait till you get a load of this five minute cameo. He is only there for 2 scenes and becomes the Rhino off screen. Worse yet rather than trying to give him any character whatsoever, he's degraded to an angry, shouting hired gun who would seem more suited for a role as a side villain in a Schwarzenegger film from the 80's. His character serves as nothing but a cheap ploy to fill more cinema seats and to tease a sinister 6 movie. <br/><br/>To top this off, the ending to just about every story in the film ends up feeling either unfinished in an attempt to lure in viewers to the next film or rushed in an attempt to create a forced conclusion. This film feels too focused on building a franchise and because of it the individual films feel less complete. For example the back story to what happened to Peter's father gets a big build up, but then after one small revelation the film just drops the plot, becoming more interested in getting some more mindless action in the film for the last few minutes. <br/><br/>Though the film doesn't get everything wrong. Seeing Spider-man go to his best to save every citizen is cool and a nice call back to the likes of the original Superman film. This is helped even further when we see how kind he is to everyone he saves, at one point saving a kid from some bullies and then complimenting his arts and crafts project. These scenes are probably the best since they nail the character and make him extremely likable. Also at times the mixture of comedy and action feels just right, being a good reflection of the comic books. <br/><br/>But these small positives do not stop Amazing Spider-man 2 being a great disappointment being a significant step down in comparison to the recent standard of Superhero movies. It has a few decent moments, but these are mixed in with far too many badly written characters and a plot that goes all over the place, lacking focus and not gauging an interest for these characters. The franchise has a lot more potential than this is given and I hope the potential is met by future instalments, but so far it is not looking good for this franchise."

","I could honestly watch it over and over again. I love how they implemented more comedy this time and thought of a happier way to communicate Peter's arrogance when putting on his costume and becoming the hero. The romance between Peter and Gwen is contagious and fun to watch. I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed seeing this film and my frustration at how long I will have to wait for the next one! It seems as though it will definitely be worth the wait. I can only hope Andrew Garfield continues to play Peter Parker because he truly brings the role to life (much better than MaGuire ever did) and conveys Peter's shy and awkward personality but also brings in different characteristics like his new found confidence he has gained from becoming Spiderman. If you haven't already I STRONGLY suggest you put this film at the top of your 'must see' cinema releases. Stone and Garfield bring together the tragedy and sorrow of Spiderman's life with the joy of being truly in love. I will anxiously be awaiting the next in the film series and the DVD release. I completely loved it."
"garretsr","4","15","33","5 May 2014"," Boring!! How did they make Spider-man Boring?
","They actually managed to make Spider-man boring!!! Most of the movie is spent on scenes and relationships that are, at best, tangential to the plot. An efficient version of the movie could have been done in a half- hour TV special. We spent most of the movie waiting for something, ANYTHING INTERESTING TO HAPPEN! While Spidey is usually the most conflicted/introspective of the major superheroes, he is still an action hero. The result was exactly opposite of 2011's ""Thor"", in which the normally flat and boring character had an engaging story.<br/><br/>The writers apparently used Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, as a template, but decided that the 42 minutes and 37 seconds of Aragorn / Awren romance was the best part of that movie. So, they expanded those scenes and made the movie that combines the worst elements of Spider-man, Return of the King, and Waiting For Godot (a play in which the main characters hang themselves because they are bored). <br/><br/>The only reason I give it 4 stars is that 1. it had decent special effects, 2. it set up future movies (anybody recognize Felicity Jones' character), 3. the plot, while boring, was comprehensible and internally consistent."
"mickael-t92","3","15","33","5 May 2014"," Disappointing Toy-Pusher.
","I'm gonna start with the positive. I like how they've chosen to follow a storyline exploring Oscorp and the Parker family's dark secrets. There are some things i feel they should have changed (Like the underground laboratory) but overall a good arc to follow.<br/><br/>Negative: What were they thinking with making Harry Osborn become the Goblin before Norman. This is a bad decision that will likely anger many fans. They gave Harry a plausible reason to become the Goblin, but this still does not sit well with me. The build-up to the Sinister Six makes it obvious that the rebooted Spiderman franchise's main motivation is to sell toys and cash in on those rather than the movies themselves."

When I heard that they were not gonna make the 4th installment of the Spider-Man series, I felt quite down. I loved Spider-Man. He's one of my favorite Marvel heroes. And then they announced that they were going to make another Spider-Man trilogy with a whole new cast, story, and director. I was not that excited because I liked Sam Raimi's work. They even changed the title Spider-Man to The Amazing Spider-Man. I went to see what it was like.<br/><br/>Well, I was NOT disappointed. Marc Webb did a good job rebooting the series. I also loved the new actors\actresses. Especially Andrew Garfield. He stole the show. I kind of thought that he's a better Spider-Man than Maguire. Then, they announced they will make a sequel. I definitely had high hopes for the The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I went to theaters to see it.<br/><br/>In fact, it was better than I thought. Once again, Marc Webb did an even better job than the first installment. The actors were great at their roles. Especially Dane DeHaan. He made a great portrayal of the Green Goblin. I enjoyed his performance in Chronicle. Jamie Foxx did a great job too. He was the perfect Electro. I just wasn't a fan of Electro's suit in this film but that's not important.

"katiewebbi","Null","16","36","5 June 2014"," Everything you could want from a Spiderman movie!
","After the reboot in 2012 the sequel The Amazing Spiderman 2 arrived at the cinema this month as one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the year. Although I enjoyed the first installment I wasn't blown away by it and felt it could've done more with such a talented cast and greatly improved special effects. Thankfully, the sequel is a massive improvement and I really loved it. It's everything you could want from a Spiderman movie; action, great characters, romance, a thrilling story and heartfelt emotion.<br/><br/>Acting and Characters: Although acting isn't normally the main focus of a superhero movie I thought everyone did a brilliant job. This may be biased because I have a huge crush on him but Andrew Garfield played Peter Parker absolutely spot on. He owns the role and his charm, witty one liners and youthful energy makes him extremely relatable. It's important to remember that Peter is an adolescent so of course he's going to be a bit cocky when he can fly around New York bounding off buildings! He can also be relied on to bring emotion and depth to the heavier scenes, his reaction to a certain plot twist at the end of the film was genuinely heart-breaking to watch. Emma Stone as Peter's love interest Gwen Stacy is also wonderful and her chemistry with Andrew is so natural and sweet that its a joy to watch. The sparks they give off in their romantic scenes together easily equal the action scenes. Its refreshing to see a female character in a superhero film who doesn't conform to the damsel in distress cliché. Gwen is an intelligent, determined and extremely motivated young woman who plays a pivotal part in the defeat of Electro. Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborn is also a welcome addition to the cast and despite their little screen time together him and Andrew make you believe that they were inseparable childhood friends. It's a much darker and less likable interpretation of the character than James Franco in the original trilogy but it makes Harry much more interesting as he hovers between arrogance and unstable desperation. His Green Goblin is also pretty damn terrifying and creates a lasting impact despite his limited screen time. As we all know Jamie Foxx is an absolute badass (see Django Unchained) and he creates a truly menacing presence as Electro. He didn't have as many scenes as was teased in the trailers and I felt like Harry was more of the main villain but Foxx did the best with what he was given, even making some god-awful cheesy lines work like 'It's my birthday, now it's time to light my candles!' I would never have guessed that his nerdy, shy alter-ego Max Dillon could come up with such witty banter! Max is slightly cartoonish and his imaginary conversation with Spiderman felt slightly off but that's down to the writing rather than Foxx's performance. He succeeds in making the character tragic and sympathetic. The consistently excellent Sally Field is also on top form and gives the film some much needed gravitas. Lastly, and sorry to end on a negative, but what on earth was that mad German scientist who experimented on Electro all about? He left a bit of a stain on an otherwise impressive acting ensemble with his pathetic attempt at a German accent and shocking acting (if that's what you can call it). If I was German I'd be pretty offended that Hollywood are still using the stereotype that all Germans are sadistic Nazi psychopaths! <br/><br/>Action: There wasn't as much action in this compared to more recent Marvel films but when they did occur they certainly packed a punch! The fight with Electro in the power station was one of the highlights and despite the slight overuse of CGI you felt like you were in the midst of the action. The final fight with the Green Goblin was also extremely intense and despite it being fairly short it kept me on the edge of my seat as the friends turned enemies engaged in a brutal and emotional battle. Maybe take some extra tissues with you too if you're like me and get far too attached to fictional characters! <br/><br/>Music: You're probably thinking why on earth am I reviewing music in a Spiderman film but I was really impressed. Every song and tune complimented each scene perfectly. I've still got Gone Gone Gone by Phillip Phillips in my head and the use of contemporary music by Pharrell Williams and Kid Cudi gave the film a youthful, energetic tone. The dubstep that accompanied every Electro scene also stood out for me, whenever those beats were played you immediately knew something was going to kick off!"
"dschlatter","6","16","36","18 April 2014"," Ah, the good old days
","I'll start with this: This movie is for teenagers only! Why? Because we (30up) remember all too well the 3 Raimi films. They were good. No, they were more than good. So here we are now. It's 2014 and we find ourselves watching part two of this pretty unnecessary re-boot*. Why unnecessary you ask? Well... Spider-Man 1 was a wonderful film. In two hours Sam Raimi introduced us to the beautifully crafted world of Peter Parker: - Peter turning into Spider-Man (entertaining) - His job as a photographer and his awful boss (good comedy) - Mary Jane Watson (fit the part nicely) - Aunt May (could she have been any sweater?) - His friend Harry O. (good fit) - Norman Osborne/ Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe was the perfect choice)<br/><br/>Sam found time to fit all of this into the first movie and it fit perfectly. That was some beautiful storytelling! The flow, the action, the cast... Awesome. And he pulled off the same with part 2!!<br/><br/>But those days are gone. With The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (and one), we get similar elements put together in a different way, but not in the same quality. It feels like one of those dance-floor remixes of classic songs. They are new and shiny and (by some people considered) cool, but really you just wish they would play the original.<br/><br/>My summary? The Amazing Spider-Man is not a bad movie... it's just inferior to the original in every way possible. That's it.<br/><br/>*Don't think that I'm against all re-boots on principle. Total Recall didn't bother me at all. It's just that a re-boot should not be done with franchises that are 5-10 years old. That's way too early. (Hear that 'Fantastic Four'??)"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","13","28","2 May 2014"," What does ""amazing"" give?
","For those who, like myself, have not seen the reboot of Spider Man franchise under a title enhanced with ""amazing"", it helps to clean the slate first. The most significant difference you may notice is the persona of the new Spider Man. While Toby Maguire oozes melancholy, Andrew Garfield is practically bubbling with flippancy (although that is not so say that there are no poignant moments). On the romance front, Mary Jane Watson is nowhere to be seen as lovely Kirsten Dunst is replaced by equally lovely Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy. Harry Osborn we are unlikely to forget as portrayed by James Franco in an agonizing transformation into the Green Goblin after his father, through episodes of the Maguire series. Now, we have Dane DeHaan, with the said transformation happening only close to the end. Entirely new is Spider Man's nemesis for this movie, one ""Electro"" played by Oscar winner Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>Not having seen the first ""amazing"" can be a plus. Spider Man is already established and fighting crime in New York, a controversial figure hailed by some and resented by others. That we haven't witnessed the budding of Peter Parker's romance with Gwen doesn't really matter. In a way, it's really neat to start with them already deeply in love, with no secrets – she knows he is Spiderman. At the same time, they are also torn by his agony in feeling that to keep her safe he has to stay away from her. This, we understand, comes from something that happened in the first episode – her father died because of him. That is enough as far as I am concerned. The beauty is in Garfield and Stone playing out their scenes convincingly, especially with the tender moments touching but not sappy.<br/><br/>As I alluded to, on the villain front, Harry Osborn that we know so well takes a back seat, at least in the role of a villain. We see him coming back from a decade-long exile to his father's deathbed, resenting and not understanding. While initially aloof, he accepts Peter Parker's initiation of rekindling their childhood friendship. DeHaan and Garfield show good chemistry in this part, making it a joy to watch. Things then start to turn nasty, which we all know from the Maguire series.<br/><br/>The key villain in this movie is a bit of a cop-out in terms of character development, especially when they have engaged an Oscar-caliber actor. The character of Max Dillon cum Electro is somewhat by the book – an extremely introvert, modest and generally ignored and taken-for-granted individual acquires through a freaky accident enormous power. An emotion dam bursts, letting out a roar of bottled up resentment and hostility to the world at large. The explanation offered by the movie makers for why this hostility is directed with such intensity to Spider Man may as well be ""We need it for the plot"". Foxx does what he can but even an Oscar-caliber actor can do only so much to salvage a hollow character.<br/><br/>But, no matter. The special effect and action sequences are nothing short of excellence. The acting of the principals, as already alluded to, are all creditable. There is also a strong support cast including Sally Field, Colm Feore and Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>So, back to my summary line – what is in ""amazing"". I cannot speak for the first one but as far as this one goes, it reinforces a trademark that the movie makers can be proud of. ""Amazing"" #3 is certainly on my awaiting-with-expectations list."

"Laakbaar","4","17","39","30 April 2014"," I walked out
","I admit that I haven't been keeping up to date with this franchise (having not even seen the last three Spidey movies). I went to see this one because when I went to the theatre it was the next movie playing.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy this movie. I fell asleep for a few minutes at the start, and I walked out after about 70 minutes, something I rarely do.<br/><br/>However, I did enjoy the 3D CGI scenes of Spidey travelling through NYC.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see that Spider-Man is more like Superman now, in terms of his strength. (But you see this creeping inflation in superhero powers in most comic-based action movies now.) <br/><br/>Garfield is not a young actor who interests or excites me. I don't really see him as Spider-Man. I did give it a shot, for an hour or so.<br/><br/>I really didn't like the wisecracking of this Spider-Man. The cheesiness of this caught me off guard. <br/><br/>I didn't like the dialogue, which was more like repartee actually. The movie collapsed several times into boring melodrama that reminded me of soap opera or Glee. The scene in which Peter breaks up with Gwen seemed forced and cliché. The scene between Peter and Aunt May seemed off and unrealistic. <br/><br/>The Jamie Foxx character was unappealing. His treatment by his coworkers was cartoonishly portrayed. (I've been wondering lately whether the Hollywood people who make movies have ever really been employed. They don't seem to know what employment is actually like.)<br/><br/>This movie felt too movieish, too full of itself. It didn't seem original. After a while, I became aware of the problem that the scenes were disjointed, and I wasn't interested enough to thread it together.<br/><br/>I didn't like the music.<br/><br/>After a while I put on my jacket and left. I'm surprised by the current score, but I suppose the legions out there have spoken and we must all bear the consequences.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to the people involved for such a negative review. I see from the demographics of the scoring that people under 18 are rating this movie the highest. This seems about right. It's absolutely absurd (and an indictment of internet rating systems) that about 20% of viewers give this movie 10/10. This is a phenomenon that I don't understand, and that I suspect has little or nothing to do with the movie itself. I want to give it 1/10 (because after all I wasted my money), but that seems irresponsible. I'll give it a 4."
"shanfan_14","6","11","23","2 May 2014"," Tone inconsistent, largely unfocused
","First, I love superhero movies and thus wanted to like this more than I did.<br/><br/>I've seen all the predecessors and certainly like Garfield and Stone infinitely more than Tobey and Kirsten, the latter of whom was supremely annoying. The casting in this actually surpassed what I expected with regard to some characters, notably Harry. The James Franco version was certainly different. I was not familiar with Dane DeHaan but he was absolutely creepy enough to be the offspring of Norman...Willem Dafoe's Norman. Some actors simply exude creepiness naturally.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie didn't know what it wanted to be. It could be said that the angst-ridden love story and the heroic tale were part of the same canvas but the transitions were jarring if they existed at all. Wise-cracks were surreptitiously spouted next to life-speeches. Something simple became overstated to the point of confusion.<br/><br/>There was no focal point. The story rambled from point A to point B by an unnecessarily circuitous route and was unsatisfying because of it. Nothing was clear or fleshed out.<br/><br/>Ideally, the ending should have come when Peter decided to hang it up, thus providing something the third installment could build on. We could see the inactive Peter recalling the tragic events of part 2. A situation arises, he recalls Gwen's speech and decides to kick back in to neutralize Rhino. Instead, this anticlimax was stuck at the end and totally collapsed the ending, leaving nowhere to go next time without some creative dancing by writers...and they had better be good ones, more organized than the ones who wrote this.<br/><br/>Finally, I love the music of the Marvel Universe. Spider Man, of course, is still under the Sony aegis and seems not to have received the attention to quality that the Disney efforts are notable for.<br/><br/>Of all the Marvel movies I have seen, I cannot recall one which had such terrible music. It was often inappropriate for the scenes, sometimes absurdly loud, nothing soaring or memorable, not even catchy. It was just clanging, boring and irritating. I was shocked to see Zimmer's name in the credits. I normally love his stuff and it generally lends gravitas to a vehicle.<br/><br/>It might be better to wait until the licensing reverts to Disney before Spider Man 3 is made. While the story could pick up on what's been done, retain characters and so on, it would still receive a fresh treatment and, perhaps, right the ship."

","Pretty boring. Jamie Foxx was a good character, but every villain in these things ends up doing pretty much the same thing - causing vast mayhem and the city to shut down. Then hero fixes it. Peter's parents subplot went on way too long and who cares, and is anybody not sick of Aunt May's homilies and Uncle Ben spouting wisdom from beyond the grave? Also, random 'dramatic' scenes like two planes somehow going to crash unless the lights come on fast (I hardly count this as a spoiler, since it exists in the film for about 3 minutes and if you don't know instantly what's going to happen you've never seen a movie before) is Stupid. Pilots flying 'blind' would certainly take measures to go up, down, something to change course, and anyway, why would they be flying directly into each other anyway? Just dumb. Overlong. Gwen was good, and Peter had good moments although S-M did seem to let bystanders get killed while he was making jokes with other bystanders."
"jake-law123","5","14","31","3 May 2014"," Not as bad as the first, but still pretty flawed.
","Even though I like this one more than the first one, it still has it's flaws. Some big, some small, either way, it makes for one average film. Andrew Garfield returns as the web swinger, and if you liked his wise cracks and sarcasm in the first one, then you won't be disappointed here. He's actually better at making up wise cracks then actually taking his job more seriously than he is. Honestly, he plays a much better Spider-man in this one, not immediately jumping on someone's face, but instead trying to reason with them, which makes him seem more like a nice guy. Gwen Stacy returns as his love interest, which makes for the main focus of the film. It's so on and off in the film since Peter is guilty over the death of Gwen's father in the first and the promise he made to him to leave his daughter out of it. Even though that's kind of interesting, they still kind of replace it with ways to make it humorous in scenes. Their affection, while touching, is cut short by the 50 other plots going on, making you just want the film to take it slow.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx as Electro was an unique design, but an ugly effect. I thought his motivation was weak and the delivery was forced. Harry Osborn, aka the Goblin was also a sh*tty villain. The kid is a bad actor in general, and he brings the Goblin to shame. Oh, and Rhino? Well, once you see the film you'll know why he's not worth discussing.<br/><br/>The main focus of the film, like I said, is the romance between Gwen and Peter. I honestly think it worked out for the most part, it was the only part of the film that didn't feel crammed or forced, it felt necessary. Even though some parts were sappy or silly, I still enjoyed their interactions.<br/><br/>That's this film's best compliment is one particular scene, and the relationship, that's about it. The rest of the film feels cluttered and crammed with all these different things going on that felt forced, I'm just like ""can we please just see him fight somebody or interact with Gwen Stacy?"" It's almost like Peter Parker is bipolar. One second he's obsessed over his parent's secret, then he's all cheery about Gwen Stacy in the next scene. Better than the first? Yes. Decent movie over all? No, was watchable but would still not recommend unless you're a comic book fan."

","This movie was a tough watch. I actually liked The Amazing Spider-Man because with all it's flaws, it showed potential, but this movie was a complete face slap to the marvel camp and on the same level as the Fantastic Four Films. Sony really needs to let this franchise go, because true fans are not going to continue to come out for or support this kinda crap. Very little humor, the action went no where and the liberties taken with character back story just made me wish this ride would end.<br/><br/>Best thing about the movie was the CGI, worst this was every last actor in the film. If you are older than 12, save your dime and your time, this is just another in the long line of comic book let downs.<br/><br/>I don't plan to see this again unless I'm being punished."

You might feel sympathy for electro but you might also think he is a psychopath which kinda works, and you can't deny that the electro visuals are AMAZING. <br/><br/>With harry you do feel sympathy but you see him quickly turn and turn again into the green goblin which looks awesome by the way.<br/><br/>Don't go to the cinema expecting The Dark Knight but go expecting the best spiderman movie to date that will be a joy to watch with anyone.<br/><br/>Final Verdict : 8.9/10"
"amrita1997","10","35","91","23 April 2014"," Peter Parker deals with the regret of breaking his promise and his alter ego Spider man faces 3 new villains in pursuit to save New York.
","As a huge fan of marvel films, this has got to be my favorite. First reason is visually how awesome it was to watch spider man fly- it was spectacular, especially in 3-D!<br/><br/>There is a fair amount of romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker who have a great chemistry on screen that worked! It wasn't a silly love side plot; Gwen Stacy wasn't a mere fair maiden Spider man had to rescue, she was a useful character and allowed the viewer to see peter/Spider man on a more personal level- definitely much different to the romance in the old spider man series!<br/><br/>The action- now this is where the review really starts- was certainly satisfying. Spider man fought with three villains, they had a great buildup (the rhino not as much) and unlike other superhero movies the main two villains don't enter the show as pure evil characters. They have some sort of relationship with Peter/Spider man which created an excellent story line, you tend to feel more when the fights actually take place. The fighting itself was just awesome. It wasn't cut short and took up much more screen time than the action had done in the first film which is ideal for sure. The producers made the fight scenes looked tactical and skillful, at the end you think ""alright now THAT was cool."" Other films take action as guns are bashing and confusion and this is why I prefer spider man, his maneuvers were unpredictable and although they were fast paced it was directed so you follow EVERYTHING- this is done particularly by slowing down some scenes- (such as when electrode and spider man meet for the second time.) This made the movie easy to follow and thoroughly engaging. <br/><br/>In terms of the casting, Andrew Garfield looks like he hasn't aged since he turned 17- pretty convenient as he plays a a college student! Thinking back on it I can say damn, the boy sure knows how to act. A challenging role, physically demanding I imagine but also needs to convincingly express a range of emotions- all which I think were executed to standard. He's even British! This was pretty shocking to find out after I had watched (well, for me at least). Oh he's pretty god damn hot too. <br/><br/>Emma stone looks like the character in the comics, which is always a plus- the blonde hair biologist, it's fair to say she looked the part. Also, can I just say how much better a movie can be when the female character ISN'T annoying? <br/><br/>Jamie Fox's character electrode was frustrating and yes, slightly unrealistic- although it is bound to be because it's classic Science Fiction, I mean more his personality. He was needy, it was actually hilarious at some points (surely done intentionally) but at other times it was a bit like, ""really?"" His character was a weak minded guy, who got unfairly treated, gets corrupt by power- oh and was totally obsessed with spider man which then just changes because... yeah, wasn't worth remembering (some trivial misunderstanding.) However, the character Electrode did look terrifying so if anything, they scored an A+ on the visuals. <br/><br/>Osborns- I feel the Osborns were better done in the previous spider man series (perhaps the only thing done right.) Norman Osborn we all know in the previous one LOOKED the part. Harry Osborn in this one acted well but his character, again, was frustrating. The friendship between Peter and Harry wasn't emphasized enough- I didn't really care about harry, and once you do watch this movie (I truly recommend you should) I didn't full grasp why the green goblin hated spider man.<br/><br/>Overall, if it wasn't clear from my excessive use of the word awesome, it was AWESOME. Nothing inappropriate, people of all ages will love it and definitely was a night well entertained, and what else can I say besides I'm counting down the days until the sequel?"

"youtube-400-376823","1","36","94","19 April 2014"," Worst super hero movie
","From the first scenes of the movie to the end screen all the movie is full of stupid forced situations that try to make sense but fail miserably. There is no development in the process to create for the super villains, no way for the people to understand their motivations to be evil, they are just crazy foes. Yes, they seem to follow the comics plot, but a movie is a different medium than a comic book, you can't throw all the possible stuff that happens in the books in several years in just a couple of hours. It's a complete chaos. I think both the direction and the script are just awful. The actors just play fine with the text lines are told to say, but still they look like schizophrenic bipolar people, unaware of the context where they are."
"mwjii","5","12","26","4 May 2014"," Eh,I wasn't impressed
","The story line was good,long,slow,but good. It settled questions from the first film. I didn't like electro at all,just a lame character I wanted Spidey to dispose of him sooner. Electro was the clichÃ© black man who was filled with hate. Not the complex character he was in the comics or 60's cartoon. I must say,the scenes were Spidey is swinging by his web thru the city and fight scenes were amazing! I liked Spidey's quick wit. I wasn't crazy for the re-imagining of Harry Osborn father in particular to his demise. <br/><br/>Sadly,the first film was much better. I was truly hoping for a much better and ramped up 2nd film."
"scott-sw","5","12","26","2 May 2014"," What the heck?
","Spiderman's web misfires so much the web of the Amazing Spiderman 2 becomes too tangled, leaving comic and movie fans stuck in their tracks. It's not that the actors are bad. It's not that the story is weak. But execution always trumps the previous two elements. It does have some good things going for it. Andrew Garfield, Emma Thompson, Jamie Foxx and Sally Field have good talent and work well with what they have. Also, towards the end of the story, we have good action laced with good battles, and good conflict. The problem is it takes way too long to get there with uneven and hackneyed direction. The story begins with Peter Parker on top of the world, chasing bad guys with the public of New York mostly behind him. In one scene, he saves a nerdy Oscorp employee, Dillon Max (Jamie Foxx). He is so eager to be liked, he assumes he and Spiderman are friends and develops an unhealthy admiration. But when Oscorp kicks him to the curb - or rather into a vat of eels that is hit by power rods, he turns into Electro. When his powers spark (no pun intended) fear, Spiderman steps in and he is shocked (no pun intended again) that Spiderman is not the friend. Meanwhile, Harry Osborn returns home to see his father die from a debilitating disease. He finds out he has it and needs help. Unfortunately, the things he needs are not available - and he is forced out of Oscorp. At the same time, Spiderman/Peter Parker is discovering the truth behind his father's disappearance. Gwen Stacey is interviewing for a chance to go to Oxford Peter and Gwen's relationship is rocky - and so is the friendship between Peter and Harry. Understand the problem? All these stories fold unevenly, and behind way too many special effects that try to dazzle the eye. Then, plot holes pop up so large, Spidey could never plug them up with enough webbing. Hospitals and airports have their own emergency generators off the grid. In the end, we have a dark, violent Spiderman, far apart from the Raimi/Macguire Era. Moreover, Garfield does not have the nerdy quality that the original star had to nail the role. Frankly, too many villains, too many special effects, too long a movie all make The Amazing Spiderman 2 too terrible to watch. It might even make you prefer Raimi's final installment to this one."
"joben-525-633946","6","12","26","17 April 2014"," It's Good but Not ""Amazing""
","Marc Webb's follow up to his rebooted Spider-Man franchise still leaves much to be desired but remains a worthy installment.<br/><br/>The film originates with a confused Peter Parker (Garfield) struggling with the morality of what is best to do for Gwen Stacey (Stone). Eventually deciding to stick to his promise to her deceased father (Denis Leary) of keeping her out of his business, he is soon thrust a further set of challenges when his sudden new best friend Harry Osborn (DeHaan) reveals he needs Spider-Man's blood to save his life, Jamie Foxx reeks havoc as the villainous Electro while trying to piece together his father's past.<br/><br/>While I commend Webb for trying, his efforts to strand all these plot points together hinders the film more than it helps. It's comparable to trying to cram twenty DVD's into a stack which hold 19, it just doesn't fit, unless you cut parts off the other DVD's to make space. This is exactly what Webb does. If you have viewed the trailers, you will realise already that many scenes did not make the final film due to the scenes being removed; this is most probably due to time restrictions on the duration. However, rather than delivering a complex and engaging story-line, Webb leaves us with numerous unfinished - some rather basic - plots and sub plots.<br/><br/>Expanding briefly on this point, I would like to commend Dane DeHaan's performance. An excellent young actor for sure, his lines and performance throughout gave his scenes gravitas, and were the engaging. In interviews prior to the release, he stated he ""doesn't think I'll ever have a character that has this big of an arc (again)"" and that Harry is ""completely different"" from at the beginning to what he is at the end. This is true however that character arc to me felt very rushed and not very complex at all; judging by the edited out scenes I'm guessing there was a beefier run through of his transformation which unfortunately as viewers, we were unable to witness.<br/><br/>Instead, Webb focuses on his hit-and-miss villain ""Electro"", the touching relationship between Stone and Garfield (on the screen, although maybe off also) as well as the dreary recollection of Richard Parker's past.<br/><br/>Let's begin with ""Electro"". To me, his inclusion feels like a CGI prop to be perfectly honest, for the most part, while Jamie Foxx doesn't really feel suited to the role of this flying electric ball (this is from someone who thinks he's a great actor, and loved 'Django'). <br/><br/>The romantic scenes - as you may expect - are done remarkably well by Webb with his experience under the helm of '(300) Days of Summer' playing a key factor here. He also chose the cast for Peter and Gwen with great precision as the chemistry is clear for all to see. Both these factors deserve commending. <br/><br/>The sub slot however of his father and his dealings with Norman Osborn feels half baked. A James Bond style opening is followed by a rather uninteresting reflection on what makes Richard Parker such a good man.<br/><br/>One final qualm is the action sequences which feel labored and never particularly engaging. Battles with Electro are just an overloaded CGI frenzy while the Paul Giamatti's eagerly anticipated Rhino makes an appearance for about two minutes (in costume). Equally irritating is DeHaan's appearance as the Goblin being very short and its fair to say his transformation leading up to that was hardly detailed on the final cut. <br/><br/>However, having focused on the criticisms, the majority of the cast were first class and the on-screen chemistry between Stone and Garfield was a lovely touch. DeHaan steals the show with his performance as Osborn (which fills the cracks about his character development ever so slightly) whilst most importantly, I can look to the next installment with optimism. Optimism stemming from a cliffhanger ending, more DeHaan and a host of possibilities for Garfield to forefront."

That said, I really don't care for the way the writers, director and editor of this series have cherry picked certain plot elements to change and others to leave intact. Also, I am very appreciative of the excellent acting skills and chemistry the principals bring to the table so I feel like there is a lot of potential wasted here.<br/><br/>The two things that really bother me are the pacing and the way the story telling talks down to the audience. First of all, this movie, as well as the first one, in the series, suffer from very long exposition up front and then break into the action later in the film, which is not always explained as well. In this case it causes serious problems in that there are several major story elements late in the film that are not explained and the audience is just supposed to go along with, without sufficient explanation. Also, they just pull some crap out of their posteriors late in the film that makes no real sense and feels like they really have no respect for their audience. Anyway, I have wasted enough time on this turkey already. I will re-watch the Sam Raimi versions over the weekend to clear out the bad taste."
"OlieRendch","7","28","72","24 April 2014"," Watch out Disney, Sony have upped their game!
","In 2012 we got to see a reboot of Spider-Man's story, in my opinion it was better than the original trilogy and I love Andrew Garfield in the role. Now two years later we have a sequel and boy does it get better. First off let's talk cast; Andrew is still fantastic as Peter Parker, he also has great chemistry with Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey. Jamie Fox as Electro was an amazing thing to watch too along with the other great cast members who all do a fantastic job (even Stan Lee with his cameo). The characters in this film were actually really interesting to watch, a lot of the story focuses on Electro and his origin which is fascinating, plausible (sci-fi wise) and downright creepy, I mean creepy; this film goes to places I wasn't expecting; some of the scenes were real freaky to watch, especially Electro and certainly the Green Goblin who was nightmarish to say the least. What added to the creepy and tension had to be the music, the music in this film is phenomenal; there are so many good parts where the music goes perfectly with the beautiful shots that the movie gives you. Talking about the score itself, whenever Electro does his thing and fires electric bolts and everything they go real heavy on the dubstep, a lot, I think that adds to film though in some way, I enjoyed it. The story itself I really liked as well, the ways they went surprised me a few times but were definitely fun to watch, (I didn't see it in 3D but from the scenes I saw at the cinema it would definitely be worth it). The only negative thing I would say about the film is that there are one or unrealistic scenes where I thought ""That wouldn't happen"", It doesn't ruin the movie but does take you out of it for a few seconds. I would say the ending will surprise a lot, and for more than just one reason. In conclusion I want to say The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the best Spider-Man film to date and is absolutely AWESOMENESS."

","The movie felt very forced. It had no continuity, it wasn't cursive. They introduced the Green Goblin too late and the fight was too brief. 1 point for special effects. hands down there. 1 point for the suit (regarding the suit from TASM which was terrible and made him look skinny and goofy) 1 point for sticking to comic books 1 point for the motivation of the villains which was extraordinarily built, i could actually feel Electro's and Harry's feelings, their villain-nes was indeed understandable. I hate Andrew Garfield's face. The soundtrack makes want to stab Zimmer. Terrible main theme. The ending was rushed and death of Harry unclear. Definitely not what i was expecting. Still can not decide if whether i regret or don't regret going to the cinema."
"james1844","4","13","29","3 May 2014"," A major production full of ""FX & CGI"" Lacking Real substance.
","This could have been a very intriguing film but all the special effects have become so common place that the average movie goer has become numb to the big screen blasts of fx's and the rest. This was a very long movie that had several scenes of mundane dialog having little do with entertaining the viewer. Was this film bad? No, but there were all too many times that I wondered if the story board people realized just how boring the scenes had become.<br/><br/>The characters and plot just fell so short of taking the viewer on an adventure worthy of the comic book. If there should be a 3rd in this series please get the writers of the comic books to put forth a really exciting story. Lastly let the special effects be the secondary hook and let the story be worthy."
"bogdan314","5","13","29","3 May 2014"," Another superhero failure and it's easy to see why (a.k.a. the movie that cannot be spoiled by a review)
","Let's face it, you did not have great expectations going into the cinema!<br/><br/>I, for example, had a pretty good idea of what this movie would be and that's exactly what it turned out to: a Friday night's pass-time with your girlfriend, eating popcorn while relaxing in the cinema chair.<br/><br/>Why wasn't this movie any brilliant, interesting or otherwise... good?! It's the same reason why we saw recent poor pieces like The Avengers, The Man of Steel, The Wolverine (and generally the other last X-Men movies), Captain America movies etc.<br/><br/>This filmmakers already know they would make a great deal of MONEY by introducing heavy CGI in order to bring life to our favorite cartoon/comic heroes. Don't get me wrong: we love CGI because it makes possible to see truly amazing unrealistic things. CGI is NOT evil!<br/><br/>The problem here is that they (the filmmakers) always find an easy thing to just leave the CGI do its part for all of us, nerds. So they never even bother considering making a good movie. They come up with a quick, dull, bad script, one that ""will do"".<br/><br/>Does that mean a superhero movie cannot be good? By all mean, no! We all saw the Dark Knight trilogy (surely, with a few reserves for the final one, but the 2nd movie was pure art). So yes, it is possible to make an awesome superhero movie. How? -> TREAT IT LIKE ANY OTHER FREAKIN' MOVIE. Hire some good script specialist to make a very good story, with some interesting and mind-blowing plot points, have them deliver outstanding dialogs and find talented actors to perform effectively.<br/><br/>I won't give any examples, but you can find plenty exceptional movies that did NOT contain superheroes, or any supernatural for that matter. But they were awesome because they had all the details.<br/><br/>So why on Earth do those pesky filmmakers keep refusing to make a good movie out of a superhero movie?<br/><br/>That is the question. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 sucked because its creator chose to. They did not bother to make it interesting. Why did they do that, as I said, remains a mystery.<br/><br/>Now on to the actual movie: an unlucky guy with mental issues suffers an accident that grants him super powers. Very quickly he turns into a bad guy and starts killing people and destroying the city. Of course, we don't see any actually good reason to do so... but it's awesome to see that blue guy shooting electrical energy all around, right? No need for character development here.<br/><br/>The Harry Osborn line (we all saw it coming) was pretty much the same. Send a rich child away from home to travel study at the most expensive schools around the world, and be sure that he'll come back evil. The lack of affection from his father always turns little boys into evil men who need no good reason to start killing people. I liked the actor and how he did his best to play this role. But he did not write the dialog, nor the story, so it's not his fault that his character was so incomplete and inconsistent. Also no need for character explanations here... Harry Osborn HAD to be evil, everyone knew that so let's swallow it.<br/><br/>Then there's the romance between Peter and the girl. Peter seems pretty happy at first, then he sees her father's ghost and remembers he's putting her in danger. Right away he goes and breaks up with her. Although he states he's been seeing the ghost for awhile, I guess this time was special enough to instantly turn his mind around.<br/><br/>Oh well... overall these two characters actually did have a little bit of chemistry... that's just my opinion. All the time though, you feel their dialogs are so forced and unrealistic... They made a pretty good ending though. Hopefully, I thought that would set a nice darker tone for the 3rd film, but the film's ending somehow gave me the impression it won't.<br/><br/>And also, there's the crowd. Those people who seems to find time to clap and enjoy the show whenever there's a killing maniac on the streets. They are never afraid they might... I don't know... die?! If Spiderman is there fighting terrifying monsters, he needs support doesn't he? Let's cheer him up.<br/><br/>Overall, the plot was straight and simple: there comes the villains, there's some fight that destroys half of the city, and in the end Spiderman takes them both down at a cost of a personal loss.<br/><br/>That's the freackin' problem of this movie. Why do they always have to show us the same things over and over... why can't they make up some interesting, intriguing plot and action, with some twists along the way and a breath-taking finale? We knew all the way how this movie would end. <br/><br/>The movie brought absolutely nothing new. Sure, I agree it was different from the other trilogy. But really, is that the only purpose of these filmmakers?<br/><br/>We saw Spiderman jumping, fighting, flying, loving, crying, saving the day. That's all folks.<br/><br/>I conclude the comment with a spoiler: whatever you think will happen in this movie, it will!"
"judywalker2","5","10","21","3 May 2014"," Excellent start that quickly deteriorates to silliness
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 starts with one of the best opening sequences that I have seen in a longtime. We get so much information concerning the Peter Parkers' parents (I don't think that saying this is a spoiler). I was really glad that they included this part as the first movie left us confused about what Peter's father had really done. But after that the movie quickly deteriorates into one stupid action sequence after another interspersed with an annoying love story between Peter and Gwen. It's really too bad because Gwen was a decent unobtrusive character is the first movie but in this movie you really want her to go away. There were a few good things Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn. The introduction of Harry Osborn could have been better as I think his story was really rushed. I have mixed feelings about Jamie Fox's Electro, he certainly is much less annoying as Electro than the stupid Max character. All in all this movie is just average just like many of the sequels have been. On another note I really think we're getting into superhero saturation, too many movies with the same plot over and over, enough already."

","i don't know how to begin, let started in this way, the tone of the film is actually good because, in opposite of his predecessor, this actually make the movie more fun to watch (seriously the previous film was actually boring, is not even got style) this one particularly got it right, its feel more like a cartoon in real life. i really like the introduction of spider-man swinging around the building it was pretty good, and i like spider-man jokes (again only in the introduction) . other hint, the soundtrack in opposite of his predecessor James horner, zimmers delivery some scores really well, the intro for the green goblin and the spider-man theme is a example, i actually remember those themes ( i still prefer Danny elfman through), and for last Dane dehaan, this guy steal the movie is actually better than Garfield in terms of acting and i actually more interesting in his character than the protagonist himself. <br/><br/>but even with that goods aspect.. i actually dislike this movie.<br/><br/>i barely understand about this film whats about (no wait i actually understand, but thats because i read the comics, and to be honest it don't makes sense either if i read the comics or not), there's so many subplots and characters in this script that never get a proper develop: peter parents, harry hill, the Gwen Stacey melodramatic romance that i really see before in so many teenagers TV series (even in twilight new moon, and for bad its actually spent about 50 minutes about this particularly pointless subplot)) max Dillon becomes electro ( and he only appear about 18 minutes in the whole movie) aunt may, etc....<br/><br/>i pretty annoying with the romance, even through stone and Garfield are good actors, in this movie i got a cringe when they appear in scene. its like : we break up, peter cries, we became friends, we kiss, we break up again, peter cries again, we kiss, break up, she went to england, peter cries AGAIN!! until the end he decides to go to england ( this particularly part doesn't make sense) and....she dies making the whole teenagers drama pointless ( and i don't care if it was like the comics, because it wasn't).<br/><br/>the villains are actually goofy and his motivation for becoming the bad guys doesn't make any sense, harry Osborn becomes the goblin in only appear about 4 MINUTES!!! electro dies for stupids reasons, and the whole rhino thing was a cheesy cameo in the end of the movie ( 2 minutes of screen time) and only serves to sell toys.<br/><br/>i through that i could like it for the action from the trailers, but the actual movie don't have good action fights like the captain America film, there's not actually really action there, it was more a cgi show ( slow motion and dubstep as plus). maybe i could enjoy the rhino and spiderman fight...but in the actual movie i felt cheated, and the rhino looks really worse that in the actual trailer, it was more like a tank that the rhino from the comic (ultimate). other thing i was expected is that from all the setup from the first film, make this one jumping to a actually good stoyline, but it didn't there so many things that actually didn't makes sense like:<br/><br/>* why harry Osborn is desperate to take spiderman blood, if Norman died with over 60 years old, he actually had years or decades to create a cure.<br/><br/>*what happened with Donal Mencken when harry becomes the goblin?<br/><br/>* why harry wanted to kill spiderman? if the spider venom didn't work in the first place. and also why harry wanted to create a league of super villains? what is the purpose?<br/><br/>*why harry disease's disappear when he is in ravencroft in the end?<br/><br/>*how electro got a new suit after escape from ravencroft?<br/><br/>*what is the purpose from oscorp to have a tank in form of a rhino? is convenient for the plot?<br/><br/>* why peter parker decides to go to england with Gwen in the end? what about his father evidence? his aunt? his work in the daily bugle? his studies?<br/><br/>*any else found that the transformation of max Dillon into electro was like Mr freeze in batman in robin? you know, convenient and dumb?<br/><br/>* any else found weird that electro looks like a crappy version from Dr Manhattan than the actual electro from the comics? (both ultimate and amazing ones)<br/><br/>* if peter parker works in the daily bugle, why we don't see it working as a photographer? what about Jameson?<br/><br/>*what is the purpose from peter to create a wall with oscorp details in his room?<br/><br/>* if peter parker is a genius why he need to watch youtube tutorials? (not a joke)<br/><br/>* how Osborn manages to control the glider? why the medical suit as a glider in first place?<br/><br/>* Andrew Garfield cries about six times in this movie, i actually don't get the reason: is about his father death? even through he didn't give a crap in the first film? about break out with Gwen? aunt may? i just i don't get it.<br/><br/>* so the spider kid... did he told his mother to take him where is the rhino, while he was dressed as spiderman? and the mother says yes?"
"andrewrodgers1985","5","11","24","3 May 2014"," Amazingly Predictable and Boring
","*** May Contain Spoilers ***<br/><br/>Not being very high on the first installment of this reboot, I went in with pretty low expectations for the second installment. While very visually impressive, the story line for The Amazing Spiderman 2 falls just about as short as the first. Outside of Sally Fields ""who plays Aunt May and Dane DeHaan ""who plays Harry Osbourn"" the acting is very sub-par. The villains in this movie come off very corny, Jamie Foxx did the best he could with a horrible script and even worse re-design of a comic character. Paul Giamatti is introduced in the beginning and only again at the end to set up the 3rd film as Spiderman's nemeses Rhino. Dane DeHaan is probably the most impressive in this film, he plays a much better Harry Osbourn than James Franco ever did, the problem being The Green Goblin character was just done not long ago in the other Spidey franchise and it feels forced. Too much time in this movie is wasted on setting up sequels for movies 3 and 4 then focusing on material at hand. The visual effects in the movie are done amazingly well, and most of the actions sequences were very entertaining, just too far in between scenes that left you asking why they were even shot."

","There is a lot to see in the Amazing Spider-Man 2 and not all of it is that great.<br/><br/>Some pretty ""amazing"" action scenes, cool CGI (visually the movie is great) and great acting save the movie from being a complete mess.<br/><br/>It's dumber, messier and unnecessarily longer than it's previous installment and as it's predecessor it feels like an incomplete set of sequences, with seemingly random tonal shifts, that never make a whole movie. There are way too many characters wrapped up in an overall decent plot, but that never tells too much - This new reboot on the franchise always feels like a backstory to me, I guess the huge production values and the fine acting makes up for all of it's major flaws. <br/><br/>The main problem with the movie though, is that it is a constant attack to the viewer's intellect. You'll have an hard time swallowing some of the scenes, and some of the characters, if you're not a 10 year old kid.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much of this, and still, I left the theater disappointed."

But the film is overall laughable. Non stop unfunny jokes, an incoherent story, full of plot holes and under-developed characters, atrocious acting and ridiculous sub-plots. The villains came from nowhere, like if they decided all at once ""Lets kill Spider Man for the sake of it!"". and they never attacked in group(like anyone intelligent enough would do). If they had a useful brain, Electro and Green Goblin would've attacked Spider Man together.<br/><br/>For those who thought SM 3 was bad, check this one out. You will pee in your pants laughing at how bad this film is."
"jayvee-deguzman","Null","11","24","1 May 2014"," Just like Spider-Man 3
","When I first saw the trailer for the movie last year I was thinking that this movie was going to be like Spider-Man 3 of the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy. Upon seeing it, man I was right, a lot of villains to begin with, too noisy for the action sequences, and too convoluted for the story line. Although I find the actions sequences truly amazing, the acting was as well superbly done; the only drawback was that the story lack depth like what happened to the conclusion of Raimi's trilogy. There was also this one scene where Electro (Max Dillon), played by the Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, emerges for the first time and I couldn't quite put it if the whispers of outrage obviously voiced by him was part of the musical score or not. This was somehow awkward because it seems like he was rapping it along with the music. There's nothing quite much to hype about this movie except that it stayed true to what happened to The Amazing Spider-Man comic book issue number 121. This movie could have deserved more treatment and more substance. Overall I would rate the movie 3 out of 5 stars."
"Ankhenaten91","6","11","24","24 April 2014"," Sony steps in to ruin Spider-Man....again
","Simply stated, this movie is a bloated mess. Too many characters, too many plots and no real reason for most of it. <br/><br/>I really liked The Amazing Spider-Man. I thought it was a welcome departure from what had become of the Raimi franchise after Sony stepped in and sabotaged the narrative to shoehorn an underdeveloped Eddie Brock/Venom and unnecessary comedic elements. <br/><br/>With this version of Spider-Man we got a better Peter Parker and we actually got a true Gwen Stacy. We saw Gwen become Peter's first love and knew that her eventual demise would become the next defining moment for Peter to become the hero he's destined to be. Instead we are short changed by a flabby screenplay that attempts to spin too many plates and leaves the viewer feeling short changed. <br/><br/>First off, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are great together. Good chemistry is not the issue here, bad writing is. The foreshadowing of her eventual death is so heavy handed at times that when it finally does happen it's poignancy is lost. Jamie Foxx is a good actor but he is given very little to work with in terms of depth of character so immediately he just feels one dimensional and flat. Dane Dehann shows up as Harry Osborne and is suddenly thrust into this plot that just doesn't have enough room for him to develop as he should. <br/><br/>Action is fine when it occurs and Garfield's wisecracks and personality are still the highlight of the movie for me. He and Stone work great and you believe in their relationship. It's the villains that have no motivation or weight. Their expository dialogue pushing the story forward but never giving a real reason to hate the web slinger.<br/><br/>Stone is smart, fearless and a welcome addition to what is usually a thankless role for most women in these types of movies. She doesn't have the powers of Peter Parker but her existence in the film is more than just damsel in distress. <br/><br/>Sony is to blame for this movie because like in SM3 they tried to fit in too many characters and didn't develop them like they need to be. Here the push for The Sinister Six and for a Venom movie are so obvious that feels like one big commercial for the next movies instead of a compelling story in this movie now. This idea of an expanded universe poisons the plot and gives us almost no emotional stakes or interest as this whole movie feels like a 2 hour trailer for another movie. <br/><br/>It's a shame. but this movie just simply isn't that good and that's just too bad."

His performance was short, sweet, and superb as always.<br/><br/>Star player, however, simply has to go to Dane DeHann! He's been one of my favourite actors (along with Miles Teller, Jeremy Renner and Evan Peters) ever since I saw 'Lawless', and once again, he certainly didn't disappoint!

After going out of the movie I realized that this is my favorite Spider-Man film (Spider-Man 2 was close), the reason for that is that while the movie is far from perfect it showed me what I wanted to see. The movie was kind of rush and you can easily tell that Sony just try to hurry up to get the sinister six film, but thanks to perfect acting from Andrew, Emma, Dane, and Jamie and perfect directing and writing from Marc Webb and some really beautiful looking shots and CGI (although some of the CGI looked like it's out of a video game), all those stuff save this movie from falling like a Spider-Man 3 and while the movie could have been way better as a Spider-Man and comic books fan that was good enough for me."

While both Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have exceptionally appeared as a perfect sweet couple thanks to their great performance, which is quite outstanding as no other superheroes have a powerful love story, but it is sad to see that it could only save the film as a fantasy romance story rather than becoming a better reboot of superhero film. Heavily used CGIs does not really enhance the film effects and the directional effort reduces the enjoyment especially to see Spidey jumping here and there from slow-mo to fast-mo, fast-mo to slow-mo for a repetitive times just like video games. However, it is surprising that collaboration between Zimmer and The Magnificent Six provides the film with a number of great scores, different style from the usual superheroes film."

The only thing that was positive was the fact, that Emma Stone's character died in the end because that was really, really bad acting. I'll give Emma Stone the benefit of the doubt, that her character just was meant to be played that way - really annoying. And Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/the green goblin was poor casting. But all around inferior acting compared to the 3 movies with Tobey Maguire. When it comes to the story the two new movies doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Hopefully the cast, director, writers move on to different things now."

Not only effects were great, but also the storytelling, humor, relationships and much more. They gave enough time to the important parts between the characters. I thought, having more than one main villain could cause problems like in the 3rd part of the first Spider Man movies, but it was different this time and surprisingly well solves.<br/><br/>A great mix of action, humor, love and pure fun.

"t-hf","10","29","78","27 April 2014"," A great peter parker movie
","This movie was great, but does have it's faults. Everything you loved about the previous movie is here. The action is exciting but doesn't outstay it's welcome, the humor is fresh, the romance is very heartfelt, Andy Garfield absolutely kills it as Spidey and Emma Stone is a great Gwen Stacey. Another great thing is that almost every character has a redeeming quality, even those that you're supposed to hate. Although the villains are evil, you feel sympathy for them in some way or another. For instance, Harry Osborn despite being evil, just wants to cure himself of his disease and Electro simply wants to be loved and notice. It's great to see villains that don't wanna take over the world for the sake of taking it over or just take over the world period. That being said, the villains are surprisingly scary for a goofy spider man flick. You can definitely tell that Electro is damaged and was even psychotic before he got his powers, giving him quite a gollum-like feel and Harry is portrayed as the conniving, calculating and methodical villain that he should be.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, this film seems to let Spider-man take a backseat for a story that is mainly about Peter Parker. the film mainly concentrates on Peter's demons and his desperate longing to know who is father really was along with trying keep Gwen safe, which is fantastic to see. Not many superhero movies do this, opting to focus on the man behind the suit and ultimately giving him more depth. I don't know about any of you, but when I go and see a spider-man movie, I usually like to see a little more than just people beating the sh*t out of each other, so this film definitely delivered on that. After all, would the superhero be there without the man that embodies them. As I said, Andrew Garfield is a fantastic Spider-man, and I think he might very well become the actor with which the character is most identified. He is the Spider-man that the world needs to see: wisecracking, confident, cocky but vulnerable, caring and with a deep love for those around him. Not to demean Tobey Maguire's performance, but I always thought that his portrayal was always a little bit bland and at some times, dislike-able. <br/><br/>However, the film does have some faults which were a little bit of a disappointment. For instance, sometimes the fight scenes are a bit stale and don't flow as well as they did in the Sam Raimi trilogy, the film does focus a little too much on the romance side of it and I wish that Spidey was in the film a little bit more. But all these faults aside, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a great film, a great sequel and does what ultimately all superhero movies should do: Show what the man behind the mask is really made of."

","if I could give this film any more than 10 out of ten I would but here comes my 19 review I rate the 3d action just like avatar which was breathtakingly amazing I saw the first film in 3d after seeing adds for it in 3d and I thought the story was better the original and Andrew Garfield made the film better as he felt nearer to spider man in the comics than Tobey McGuire he was good but there is all ways someone to it better the original films from Sam Rami were good stories so you have to compare the original sequel which I loved to this 3D spectacular and it doesn't compare to in amazing spider man as this brilliant sequel has a great story heart breaking emotional story around Gwen and peter their relationship in real life sends sparks flying literally in the film which makes this film a whole lot better and the comedy sections are so funny sometimes easing the craziness going on around him when the action really gets hot you find out about his peter parker dad in a thrilling opening sequence which is awesome in 3D and a conspiracy theorist will wonder if his father is really dead or not so I wonder will we see the father again lets see any way this film will have a smile on your face watching the action you find yourself laughing so much but flying with spider man will make you have a fear of heights if you see certain parts there is great comic feel to this story with Jamie fox you have awesome baddie as electro you feel for the guy but sees the world the breath taking battles are stunning and their battles with the urban soundtrack just adds to the 3d effects with the electricity you think you are going to be hit with two more baddies this is as good if not better than spider man 3 theirs issues with peter and Gwen that need to be sorted as the end gets close the action is ramped up again choices are made and new and old baddies to get and sequel from this will have tragic consequences for peter and spider man the final battles scenes makes spider man 2 look crap. 3D effects for these scenes are a standout moments takes your breath away with a twist in the story and Paul Giamanti he was good as rhino I never would have thought he would be this good and the green goblin looks menacing and harry Osborne played by Dane Dehaan plays it so chilling that puts William Defoe outing to shame only as we compare we see which actors do justice to these characters at the time spider man was good but with the director Marc Webb he explores the film and human and spider man life and come up with a power full action and the best franchise reboot since the dark knight role on number 3 with and the ending leaves it open for 2 characters in this film to make the action even better wow this doesn't feel like 2hrs20mins this film is well worth watching doesn't matter how many films spider man there once they keep things fresh new enemies and special effects to match then I don't see why this film should beat the box office predictions a beat the spider man 3 3day opening day of 150million I reckon 139 million"
"Anurag-Shetty","10","24","63","1 May 2014"," An absolutely flawless film that is, far better than its predecessor. The best Spidey movie, yet!
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 continues with the story of Spider-Man/Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield). After the events of the first film, Peter Parker is finally getting comfortable & starting to enjoy being Spider- Man & saving people's lives. He's in a stable relationship with Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) & everything in his life seems to be perfect. Enter Electro/Max Dillon(Jamie Foxx). Dillon, is a mild mannered scientist who is saved by Spider-Man, during one of his crime fighting routines. After this, Max becomes a huge fan of Spidey, which slowly turns into obsession. After a fatal lab accident, Dillon is transformed into super-villain, Electro. Peter's life becomes even more complicated when his childhood best friend, Harry Osborn(Dane DeHaan), returns to New York City after being away for ten years. Harry asks Peter for an unusual favor. Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop Electro & comply with Harry's request before he gets into further trouble. Peter also wants to desperately find out what happened to his parents, Richard Parker(Campbell Scott) & Mary Parker(Embeth Davidtz), after they suddenly abandoned him as a child and left him in the care of, Aunt May(Sally Field) & Uncle Ben. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was, simply put, amazing! Director Marc Webb neutralized all the flaws that bogged down, The Amazing Spider- Man(2012). Webb learned from his mistakes & delivered an engaging, emotional, heartbreaking & action-packed sequel, from start to finish. Webb focuses more on Peter & Gwen's relationship, like he did in the first one. However, this in no way slows down the pace of the film. There are fewer action set-pieces compared to the previous Spider-Man movies. Nevertheless, whenever Spidey faces off against the villains of the film, the action packs a punch & the 3D adds more pop & zing to the proceedings on screen. The 3D has been put to good use throughout the movie. Apart from the web-swinging & action sequences, the 3D has been put to good use in the dialog scenes, as well. Thanks to the 3D, we actually feel like we're web-swinging from rooftop to rooftop, like Spidey does in the film. The special effects are incredible. Electro doesn't look computer animated at all. The CGI looks realistic throughout the film. Electro looks as realistic as a guy surging with electricity can look! The plot was realistic & fast-paced, simultaneously. 2 hours & 22 minutes goes by, in a flash. The performances add to the magnificent experience of an already, flawless film. Andrew Garfield is outstanding as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Garfield surpasses his performance in the first film. Garfield transitions between, Peter Parker's vulnerability & Spider-Man's sarcasm & wit with ease & grace. Andrew Garfield doesn't play Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man! Emma Stone is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Stone is beautiful, charming, funny & intelligent, all at once. Garfield & Stone's chemistry is more electrifying than in the first film. Andrew Garfield & Emma Stone's real life relationship, translates really well into the film. Peter & Gwen's love for each other feels natural & genuine. Jamie Foxx is awe-inspiring as Electro/Max Dillon. Foxx easily switches, from mild mannered Oscorp electrical engineer, to menacing leather-clad super-villain. Dane DeHaan is spectacular as Green Goblin/Harry Osborn. DeHaan's Goblin is evil & menacing. However, I liked James Franco's portrayal of Harry, better. Although I loved DeHaan, Franco was able to garner the viewer's sympathy more than DeHaan's Harry. Don't get me wrong. Dane DeHaan portrays a wide array of emotions as the conflicted Harry Osborn, effortlessly. Colm Feore is impressive as Donald Menken. Felicity Jones is effective as Felicia. Paul Giamatti is perfect as Aleksei Sytsevich. Sally Field improves drastically as Aunt May. Campbell Scott & Embeth Davidtz are excellent as Richard & Mary Parker, respectively. Max Charles is flawless as Young Peter Parker. The supporting characters are effective too. The Amazing Spider- Man 2 is a must watch, especially on the big screen. It's an EPIC film, whether you love Spider-Man, or not."
"jamesissuperawesome","10","24","63","17 April 2014"," Everything I wanted it to be.
","So I saw The Amazing Spider-Man 2 last night, and I went in with HIGH expectations. Somehow, the film still shot my expectations straight through the roof and blew me away. As readers of comics, or big Marvel fans will know, this really stays true to the comics, unlike the Tobey Trilogy. One thing they did with this film which I loved, was they spent a large chunk focusing on the origin of villains in the most interesting way. Plenty of nods to other Spidey villains not-yet- appeared to give you a few nerd-gasms, and the essentially cheesy but brilliant line - ""Let's go catch a spider.""<br/><br/>I was amazed at how much emotion I felt from the actors, and from myself, through several scenes. My whole theater reacted the exact same way to each key scene, and I think that's impressive filmaking. <br/><br/>Go see TASM 2 for action, emotion, comedy and lots and lots of fun."

","Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>God! just went through a lot of trouble to sign up and confirm my account just to rant about how stupid this movie was. I don't really remember the first one too well except for being kinda impressed. This one was bad...REALLY BAD!<br/><br/>It was just an all around mess, is it the editor's fault? Soundtrack by the way was sad cliché'. Most of this 6.5 hr movie (YES! They lie! this goes on forever!)is a ""love story"" in which Peter and Gwen bicker cutely about how she's moving to England but he won't say I love you (the dialog is a joke!)or he talks to his stupid aunt for 15 mins. at a stretch while crying. Picture a Tarantino movie written by a drunken 12 year old.<br/><br/>Did you ever try to do something and ran out of time and it turned into a panicked disaster? That's what this movie is. The dragged out love dialog has some metaphorical quality in that Harry Osborn keeps complaining he's dying which is what made me feel like I was dying and walk out with only like 10 minutes left. They tried to make this a serious love story. I didn't get to see the stupid rhino."
"sad-hammad","10","16","39","4 May 2014"," Really Amazing Spidy..
","Amazing SpiderMan is really amazing specially the VFX part,i am enjoying a lot to watch in 3D and will be watch again.The villain, Electro, is also excellent. He is visually incredible and his fights with Spider-man are the some of the highlights of the movie. The Times Square fight sequence is the best action sequence I have seen so far this year, and it will probably remain the best for a while. Jamie Foxx's performance is excellent and he plays Electro as villainous and is also entertaining before he gains his super powers. The cry scene by spiderman at the loss of gwen was really good, seriously moving. The subsequent drama surrounding spiderman giving up because of his guilt, the world going to crap, his Aunt verbally chastizes him for letting his self go...he mustards up the courage to try, re-enter spiderman!"
"yobroyo123","10","32","88","24 April 2014"," Just amazing, no words to explain how good it is.
","No words for how incredible it is.<br/><br/>I literally came out of the cinemas speechless. I watched it in the world's largest Imax, in 3d, and boy it was amazing. Everything was just so awesome. The music was amazing, the effects were a million times better then expected, and the cast was fantastic. Dane Dehaan was fantastic, and I couldn't have thought of someone better then Jamie Foxx to play Electro. Andrew Garfield was awesome- he fits much better into the roll then in the previous movie, and Emma Stone was also great. All in all, I had an adrenaline rush the entire time.<br/><br/>To start off, the plot is amazing. Its not just action, stuff happens. Very, very dramatic at some bits- 10 or so minutes was really hard to deal with, you know what I'm talking about if you've watched it. I was very teary after wards. There are a lot of creatures and enemies, but unlike what I think the original Spiderman 3 did, it did not introduce them straight in. I think one reason why people generally didn't consider Spiderman 3 that great was because of the dive in, all-creatures-introduced kind of plot. There was not really any description given, and things weren't introduced well. This definitely is not the same with this movie. There is tons to battle all the way through, but Marc Webb does it so well. The structure of the movie is awesome, the dialog is well written, and I came out wondering how could anyone, dis this movie.<br/><br/>Moving more into the sort of music this music has, it's very electronic and very heavy dubs. It simply makes this movie not even comparable to the old Spiderman 2. I like both in different ways, but this really kicks ahead of it in so many ways, starting with the music. It was really over the top actually, but thats what made it so modern, so clean, and finished. Its a combination of both beautiful soundtrack (Hans Zimmer, thank you) with a blast of fresh electronic music. The beats entwining with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack were beautifully mixed. Great idea, and credits to all the music department. I will definitely buy the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Now to the graphics. Well OK, I doubted it entirely after watching the trailer which looked like someone had overloaded the saturation bar, but they were amazing. I admit, the 3d probably did it for me for once and things just seemed perfect. Not sure if the experience watching it was affected for most people not having this massive 3d view, but it certainly made me more adrenaline rushed. Credits to the visual effects. Well done.<br/><br/>The cinematography was really great as well. Some of the birds eye shots were really arty. It must have been crazy getting some of the shots they did get- I know a lot of them are probably animated or cgi, but they really looked very real. Great camera-work- really stylish, quick and jumpy, but it was pleasantly done. I came out feeling dizzy, and that combined with just what I'd seen kept me speechless for a while. It was a good experience, and I came in with a sad, yet good feeling.<br/><br/>Amazing, 10/10- no joke, I think it earns it. Marc Webb has overall done a brilliant job. This movie does receive a lot of hate, but hopefully people like me won't be put off by it. I quite frankly think the makers are copping quite a bit from some of the haters, but hopefully you will know if it's for you or not."
"deol-arshdeepsingh","10","22","57","2 May 2014"," awesome movie
","I personally thought this was an excellent film. It had a good amount of comedy, truly deep emotions, and brilliant action. A great, cohesive film to lead on from the first one.<br/><br/>The relationship between the two main characters are brilliant, and you can really understand what's going on between them as both actors portray their characters very well.<br/><br/>Also, what I like from these movies are that they are more relative to the Spider-man comic books, compared to the Spider-man Trilogy (and let's be honest, they were terrible.) If you have read the comic books, then you'll understand where I'm coming from when you see this movie.<br/><br/>but she did not deserve to die :("
"ghostmwsandman493","10","31","85","2 May 2014"," This movie was awesome and amazing no pun attendant
","When I came into this movie I was actually worried that it might be over crowded but it wasn't. You know Spider-man is just doing his spider-man stuff. I really like his web swinging in this one when he is swinging I can see the webs attaching to buildings and his costume is flapping while he is falling it awesome. Spider-man actually wise crack more than he did in the amazing spider-man or the Raimi's trilogy. Peter Parker in this movie was spectacular, Garfield was amazing as spider-man.Gwen Stacy was an amazing love interest, yeah Gwen and Peter had their cute moments in the movie. So spider-man is just having his regular spider-man life. Then you see Electro (Jamie Foxx) come in and start a chaotic problem in times square. I feel like that scene in times square was the best scene in the entire film. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) was spectacular as that role. Im not saying James Franco role as Harry was bad, Im just saying Dehaan performance was better I fill the things that harry is going through. In the end the movie was awesome, Andrew Garfield was awesome, Jamie Foxx was awesome as electro, Emma Stone doing very well with Gwen Stacy. Thats why I rate it a 10 out of 10."
"jdesando","Null","10","22","4 May 2014"," Fear being caught in a web of boredom.
","Aunt May (Sally Field): ""I once told you that secrets have a cost. The truth does too.""<br/><br/>The truth in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is it might cost you over $10 to be bored for 142 minutes. Spidey/Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is fighting the romantic demons once again while powerful enemies are reduced to the status of playground bullies by comparison to the film's minutes. The reboot has moments of humor (Peter Parker: You want me to come down there so you can kill me? Aleksei Sytsevich: Yeah! Peter Parker: OK, I'll be right there.) but just too few. In fact, I may not review another super-hero film this summer just to avoid wasting more hours on these clichéd adventure-fantasies. <br/><br/>Marc Webb goes nose to nose with Sam Raimi's earlier trilogy and comes off second place (notwithstanding Raimi's soporific 2007 Spider-Man 3). Although Peter's on again-off again love of Gwen (Emma Stone) is as repetitious as the rest of the film, the moment he allows her to contribute her intelligence to the downfall of Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx), the film becomes charged with honest characterization—she is after all going to Oxford—whereby the old stereotype of the helpless maiden is short-circuited for a moment, but only a moment. Most of the other time she is in need of rescue or trying to break up their relationship, both motifs overwrought and tedious. <br/><br/>By the way, Electro is a promising villain, pumped up with energy that can debilitate a city and a character from humble roots, who could have provided fascinating complexity but who ends up just getting too charged up. The special effects for Electro brimming with volts and Spidey spinning through Gotham are as to be expected, state of the art. <br/><br/>But a good story is more than CGI—it should engage the minds of bright people gone bad, such as the heir to Oscorp, Harry (Dane DeHaan), who is the new head of the sinister corporation Peter's father worked for in genetic engineering gone wrong and where Max picked up his energy.<br/><br/>Harry has his moments, but like Electro, he can't trump the time director Mark Webb and his writers give to the simple-minded star- crossed romance. Webb is far away from the lovely little story of troubled romance he directed in (500) Days of Summer. Maybe when DeHaan fleshes out the Green Goblin, and maybe Gwen returns, then I will be renewed, overcharged as this iteration is with mediocre romance.<br/><br/>Peter Parker: There really is no place like home."
"adrongardner","5","10","22","1 May 2014"," Green Goblin is all hairspray
","Heavy handed, transparent, boring and redundant. <br/><br/>This is the state of every single super hero movie released in the last few years. Somehow, the Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to up the ante in every department. I don't even remember what I saw after two and a half hours. <br/><br/>This movie is more heavy handed, more transparent and more boring than just about any I can think of. A fan only of the first Raimi job, these Webb movies in particular, are utterly soulless. Garfield isn't bad, but he's not that interesting. It could be because he's not on screen doing a whole lot other than spilling his faux emotional state of mind all the time, or that he's just not a good actor. I can't decide.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is good but Green Goblin is just abominable, just awful. <br/><br/>I'm going to end it there, there's nothing left to tell."
"josh-rhoden","7","10","22","20 April 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 certainly lives up to the title.
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 tells a new story about Peter Parker's duty to fight crime as the much loved superhero, Spider-Man. Peter Parker finally graduates from high school in this sequel after a very engaging opening involving Richard Parker and a car chase between Aleksei Sytsevich (who later becomes The Rhino) and Spider-Man. Just like the first Amazing Spider-Man, this movie has a story that is more linked to the comic books (than the Raimi trilogy of course) and Spider-Man still uses web shooters that create more intense fight scenes.<br/><br/>The villains include Electro and Green Goblin (Rhino would be included but he only appears for a brief moment at the end of the movie) Max Dillon/Electro is considered as the main antagonist of the film with two battle scenes between himself and Spider-Man. Green Goblin/Harry Osborn has a 10-15 minute battle scene with Spider-Man near the end which is the cause of one of the most emotional scenes in cinema. Both transformations of the characters into their actual villainous counterpart are very convincing, and the CGI/prosthetics are very well done, and The Green Goblin comes off very scary with an equally scary and menacing laugh. Spider-Sense is tackled perfectly in the film in different slow-mo moments which leaves you asking the question: How Spidey going to do this one? The fact the Spider-Man uses web shooters sometimes leaves him at a disadvantage when they break adding to the tension of the movie. <br/><br/>Once again the relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy remains very strong and convincing just like the first Amazing Spider-Man which continues to add towards the emotional impact of the whole film. Gwen also helps Spider-Man throughout the film with the villains which make her a much better character than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson.<br/><br/>The whole untold story of Peter Parker's parents is tackled once again revealing a lot more about the story but seems pointless as it reveals one thing that we already knew: Oscorp is bad! Aunt May and Peter are shown interacting a lot more which shows more to their relationship. It's also hinted throughout the film that Aunt May knows Peter is Spider-Man. The comedy is as funny as before and the suit was awesome.<br/><br/>Overall the brilliant acting, a perfect cast, exciting action sequences, outstanding CGI, cool villains, a convincing relationship between Peter and Gwen, an epic story and the emotional impact make the film the best not only Spider-Man film but possibly even the best superhero movie made. The problem? A lot of footage from the trailers isn't in the actual film but oh well. Perhaps there's a director's cut. As much as I liked it, after seeing it a second time I realised that there some scenes that are either pointless or go on for too long. About half-way through the film it starts to slow down, and starts to drag after a huge break where Spider-Man doesn't appear for quite a while.<br/><br/>If your a Spidey fan, check this film out. If your not or you haven't seen the first Amazing Spider-Man, watch it so that you can check this movie out!<br/><br/>SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Green Goblin's fight with Spider-Man is one of the most intense scenes ever in cinema! Not only did Gwen Stacy's death cause many people in the cinema to weep, a part of me died when I saw her death. Andrew Garfield's acting at that moment and the character's death overall make it truly heartbreaking. For this reason the main villain of the film, for me, feels more like Harry Osborn than Electro. Rhino's appearance at the end is very exciting and watching Peter mourn Gwen's death is another scene that got me welling up. Any true Spidey fan will shed a few tears. Even if your not a Spidey fan you may shed tears!"
"moviescoundrel","7","7","14","2 May 2014"," Not So Amazing
","This film was a bit of a departure from what I was expecting based on the previews. I thought it would be action first, story second. This however, was not the case. The majority of the film is a drama. A character study of Peter Parker, his journey to find out more about the mysterious disappearance of his father years ago, his quest to conquer his love issues and internal conflict with the promise he made with Gwyn's father, his role as a friend to Harry Osborne and a nephew/son to his Aunt May. Although directly related to his identity as Spider-man, he doesn't have many physical dangers as Spider-man. Sure there are a few criminals here or there, but Spidey doesn't ever seem to have an issue resolving the problem. When needing to save 20 people at once, time just slows down and he does it without a problem. Some of the action even seems a bit 90's ""Batmani""ish. He also seems intrinsically motivated by mostly his selfish desires and not actually saving people or being there for his city. I don't think it needs to be the predominant theme, just doesn't seem to be present at all. His acute reflexes and strength are more than sufficient for almost every problem he encounters. There typically is not a real sense of danger or mortality for him. While I appreciated Parker's attitude and snarkiness in the first film, it doesn't sit as well for me here, or maybe doesn't feel as genuine.<br/><br/>We first see Spider-man in a scene toward the beginning of the film in a very cheesy scene with graduation taking place the same time as Peter trying stop an out of control plutonium truck hijacked by Victor (Giamatti). This seems a huge departure for Giamatti and just feels awkward, not gritty or realistic like many of the Marvel movies made today. I kind of feel that way with a lot of the action in the film although the beginning is by far the worst. There definitely are not as many action scenes in this follow up as there were in the original, and I'm not sure if the film is better or worse for it. I actually dug the drama aspect of the film for the most part. It did seem like it was a love story predominantly, and this could ""kill"" (pun intended) the continuity slightly when moving to the third installment, as I just don't think it's going to feel the same. Sequels are rarely better than their predecessors, and this is NOT a bad film, but based on the trailer, I was expecting more in this 2.5 hr escape."
"carchst","1","26","70","21 April 2014"," Yawn!!
","Since when did a superhero movie turn into a love story? Very little action and a lot of scene setting. I forgave the first movie for the extended periods spent on back story but not the second. I am not a big fan of the actors in the roles at all - I just don't connect with them and couldn't care if they live or die. The action scenes were far too short and did not take up much of the movie at all - 20 minutes maximum. Even my daughter who is a huge fan of this genre of movie thought this effort was poor. I am sure that this review is in contrast to the vast majority of reviewers who seem to have been kind so far but I certainly wish that I had waited for the DVD and even then it would only have been worth a rental. If you want to see a love story then go see a love story, if you want to see a superhero action movie - see something else!!"

It was one of the most action packed and emotional superhero movie i have seen. Not only are you learning about Spider man but also Peter Parker himself. The audience can link with the character of Peter Parker and the situations he is going through. Also you get to relate with the movies main villain and his back story on how and why he becomes a villain. Not only is it action packed but also is very funny. There is several scenes through out the movie which make the audience laugh. I highly recommend a ticket to the cinema to watch the Amazing Spider man 2."
"mounirrmaged","7","5","9","22 April 2017"," One of the worst marvel movies
","This has to be one of the worst modern superhero movies I have ever seen, possibly also one of the worst. This film has a lot of flaws so bad, so filled with it, it would take a lot of time to analyze it. THE PLOT: The story is a jumbled mess. There is no sense of focus to the film. It tries to answer what happens to Peter's parents, but later on it tries to add mystery when Peter finds the video about his father. Like, why? You already answered the question, why put this in? It just has no sense of pacing. And then there is Electro's sub plot which is forced, poorly fleshed out backstory with the most generic choices a film maker can think off in a superhero movie. This is a bottom of the barrel type of villain, even worse than terrible villains like Lex Luthor from bvs or the joker from suicide squad. On top of that, you also have Harry's sub plot, which is also phoned in, it is just there to add more torture. They try to make him this sympathetic and lost person who loses his family and friends, but here is the problem: THEY BARELY SHOW STUFF LIKE THAT. He barely has any chemistry with the rest of the characters, so why should we care about his arc? <br/><br/>THE WRITING: This is one of the worst, poorly written blockbuster movies I have seen. Just like suicide squad, they use cookie cutter dialogue. In the first scene with his parents, the dialogue is really clichéd. They don't talk like real people. Here is some of the dialogue in the plane scene with Peter's parents: <br/><br/>Mary Parker: ""Did you see his face? He's never gonna understand"" Richard Parker: ""Mary, we've been through this. Our life, as we know it, is over. We're gonna spend every day from now on looking over our shoulders and never feeling safe. We can't do that to him. "" Why should we even care about this if you don't even build up these characters? Aren't they supposed to be crucial to the plot? Why even bother to put them if there is no care? <br/><br/>I also need to point out that the humor here is terrible, like really terrible. I can point out my finger at the scene where Spider-Man strips the Rhino's pants and stop there, but I'm not gonna stop there. I've noticed that many of the dialogue is repeated a second time for some reason. I don't understand why. Did the director think it will add ""drama""? Because it doesn't. It's just annoying. <br/><br/>THE DIRECTING: Okay so this is actually a mixed bag. Some of the directing is nice, like the scene where Spider-Man swings in the first 10 minutes, or the scene of his room shot upside down. But sadly, there is unneeded shaky cam. In the first ten minutes, when the ""bad guy"" tries to hijack the plane, there is pointless shaky cam to the point where it's hard to follow it. The choice for musical score is also very lazy. These are scores you find on YouTube for crying out loud. The only decent use of directing is the slow motion which does give some insight of details that matter, like when Spider-Man goes out of his webs in the scene he meets electro for the first time, but still there is poor direction. <br/><br/>THE CHARACTERS: I hear this a lot, Andrew Garfield is the best Spider-Man for some reason because he tells jokes or because he is more confident. But here is the problem. Peter started as a geek. From the first reboot, Peter is already a much more confident person. He doesn't need to be bullied or be seen as a nerd. Some of the choices he makes are also alienating. Like for example, he promises Gwen's father to not harm her, but he doesn't attend her funeral to support her loss. It really also doesn't help when Andrew Garfield gives a poor performance. Even when he does gives the quips, it just comes off as cocky, irresponsible and childish. <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy is the only decent character in this entire franchise. She is supportive, she is decently acted by Emma Stone, she is smart and uses her brains to help Peter, she is the one who actually shows more emotion and makes this ""love story"" more believable. But sadly, they just don't give enough focus, because the film is a mess. So, when the time comes for her to die, where you should be invested, it seems be a generic death scene for comic fans to recognize. <br/><br/>Electro: This is also one of the worst villains in a comic book movie. He starts off as this generic Edward Nigma rip off (Yeah for some reason, this sounds like a good backstory) who forcefully becomes Spider-Man because he saved his life, but then he turns on him because he thought he set him up, even though Spider-Man offered him help, so it just comes as contradicting and a continuity error, and becomes a forgettable, generic villain. <br/><br/>I know a lot of people love this movie and I respect that, but I personally just can't love it. In fact, I despise it. ﻿"

","I liked this movie because it has been one of the best movies I've ever seen. The characters acted excellent, their exact roles were their personalities. He had a very good development. Characters effects and features are remarkable, because the whole movie had a meaning. The new characters were were very good. I have no bad unlike criticism is good because I found it one of the best movies that have miss Spiderman.the only comment I have is that he should not die Gwen Stacy. The new Spiderman Andrew Garfield acted on, I like more than the previous one because the previous was coming down when stupid fight and did nothing, however this has not fought better and more fun."

In addition to this and in order to spice up the story a bit our hero has to come to terms whether his relationship with the girl he loves is viable or to terminate it so that he can protect her.<br/><br/>Aside from the rather unsophisticated storyline, the spectacle will not disappoint.

"shawneofthedead","8","13","31","8 June 2014"," Comes with its share of problems (largely due to its unwieldy plot), but is definitely far better and more emotionally affecting than its predecessor.
","On balance, The Amazing Spider-Man was a bit of a disappointment. Not financially, of course - it did so well that the inevitable sequel is now in cinemas, just two years later, and a third film and spin-off are all currently in the works. But there was something missing in that first film in a new trilogy: a little of Peter Parker's soul, and a cohesive, streamlined plot that made full use of its cast's talent and chemistry. While hamstrung by a few of the same problems (notably: a painfully overstuffed story), The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is considerably more exhilarating and rewarding an experience - rich, dark, and brimming over with romance, thrills and emotion, this is really the movie that should have kickstarted a new franchise.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is now a full-fledged superhero/vigilante, even as he struggles with his personal romantic dilemma: he's crazy in love with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), but promised her dying dad that he will stay away from her to keep her safe. As he tries to reconcile the conflict between his heart and his head, new threats emerge all around him. Lonely, love-starved Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) fixates on Spider-Man and believes them to be best friends - which becomes a problem when an industrial accident transforms Max into the literally electric Electro. At the same time, Peter's childhood buddy Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns home, suffering from a debilitating genetic disease that he's convinced can only be cured with a transfusion of Spider-Man's magic blood.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't enough story to chew over, the film also dwells at length on Peter's history with his birth parents. We all know that Mr. and Mrs. Parker left young Peter with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) and never returned for him. Here, that fateful decision is explored more fully, as we come to understand how Richard Parker's (Campbell Scott) research is more intimately tied-up with his son's present and future than anyone knew. <br/><br/>Frequently, the film feels as if it's bursting at the seams, its many narrative threads jostling for attention in a most frustrating way. It flits restlessly from the creepy adoration Max has for Spidey, through to Peter's need to fend off Harry's demands to meet his alter ego, before it morphs into the re-telling of his origin story. And it aims to set the stage for Sinister Six, the supervillain spin-off that Sony's already putting together. Frankly, none of it should work at all.<br/><br/>The odd thing is how Webb manages to blend and elevate his big, clumsy chunks of story with some truly excellent character work. Ultimately, this film succeeds because it's tapped properly into the heart, soul and spirit of its title character: whether it be his cheeky wise-cracking in the face of mortal danger, or his deep, abiding love for Gwen and his steadfast Aunt May. Whenever The Amazing Spider-Man 2's over-abundance of story threatens to overwhelm, its delicate, heartbreaking web of relationships enable it to power on through. There are even some nice grace notes in his interactions with Max, who goes from adoring stalker to unhinged supervillain; and Harry, whose introduction into this particular franchise is oddly abrupt but kinda-works because of the chemistry between Garfield and DeHaan.<br/><br/>Most winning of all is the tender, spiky and very affecting relationship between Peter and Gwen. The first film ended in an oddly downbeat and sour way, with Peter deciding to break his vow to Gwen's dying father to stay away from her. Fortunately, the sequel makes up for that strange lapse in character, allowing Peter to struggle with the morality of being with Gwen. It makes for a fascinating interplay between the two characters, as Peter tries repeatedly to avoid dragging Gwen into his super-charged life, while she insists on getting to make her own decisions and living every day on her own terms. It's nice to see a female character in a superhero film - especially one with no superpowers but her own personality and intelligence - take charge of her own destiny in so firm and unequivocal a way.<br/><br/>In effect, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 really is entirely about the relationship between Peter and Gwen - watching the film makes it far easier to understand the decision to cut Shailene Woodley's Mary Jane Watson (the supposed real love of Peter's life) out of it. Her inclusion in an already overstuffed plot would have greatly distracted from the film's core themes of love, loss, sacrifice and fighting on in the face of devastating heartbreak. It's a good thing that the chemistry between Garfield and Stone is so off-the-charts fantastic - together, they lend the film an emotional depth and resonance, particularly in its spine- tingling and game-changing ending, that its predecessor sorely lacks.<br/><br/>Truth be told, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't a perfect superhero film. Objectively, it's trying to do too many things at once, and many would argue that it doesn't succeed on most counts. But, emotionally, the film works so well and so powerfully that it helps smooth over many of its narrative road-bumps. Add the heart and chemistry of its central relationship to some cracking action sequences and a final scene both enormously manipulative and effective, and this really does mark - finally - the very welcome return of everybody's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man."
"rikandum-205","9","13","31","25 May 2014"," Why the hate? This movie is great!
","Some called it the best Spider-Man movie, others said it was the worst. Some even say the cast wasted their talent, the truth is this movie divided Spider-Man fans, although most people liked it! I think it was a great movie, the introduction of Electro really moved towards the story, and now people are expecting the Sinister Six and Venom in the next movie! I also think the new Spider-Man suit is much better than the one in 2012, it's more like the one from the comics. In my opinion the movie had some influence from The Ultimate Spider-Man comics because of the design of Electro and the big eyes in Spider-Man's mask. About the story, it was good but not very solid, it had its gaps, but overall they managed to introduce 3 new villains and continue Peter Parker's story correctly. Acting was good, not great, I think Andrew Garfield is a great actor, he did very good. Jamie Foxx did good too, some people think he did bad, I think he played a unique character, a fanatic that felt betrayed by his hero. The movie introduced another important character which was Harry Osborn. This one looked more like the one from the comics comparing to James Franco in the trilogy, and I think he really mattered by being the Green Goblin, which looked better than I expected. The VFX were very well done, it looked really authentic, they made it look even better! Overall the movie was amazing, I can't wait to watch the third one in 2016!"
"jeancobo8","10","31","87","1 May 2014"," Amazing like the title says it
","It was an amazing movie, it had it all! Action, romance, funny moments, and it'll drag you to the edge of your seat. Must WATCH (very comic based the Director did a great job sticking to the comic unlike the past spider-man trilogy). Andrew Garfield had an amazing performance he portrayed the funny and sarcastic spider-man we all love and read about. He is great at showing and sharing emotions so one as a viewer gets involved quick. Emma Stone is a beauty off the charts but, she isn't only a beauty, a great actress as well.<br/><br/>You will not have problems with being able to follow the story line since they have managed to make it as understanding as possible. <br/><br/>Does not get better!"
"TommyDrama","8","14","34","24 May 2014"," A fair review (IMO)
","This was my favourite Spidey yet and I hope this review will do justice to what really was done well and poorly. <br/><br/>The story really had me engaged. Moments with Peter and Gwen were very well done. I read a review about how selfish Peter Parker is which thereby makes him not at all heroic. He is a hero, but he is also a teenager which naturally leads to a conflicted protagonist. That's fair and more than acceptable. <br/><br/>Fanboys constantly complain how movies don't stick to the source material but I think Marc Webb and the writers have done a decent job in blending the standard canon and ultimate Marvel universes. My only question about this is: why skip over Norman Osborne? Perhaps we will discover that in Spidey 3 and 4. Perhaps not. Keep in mind, as Sony prepares to challenge Disney/Marvel by expanding the Spider-Man universe, this series must act as a giant set up for the Sinister Sixwhich, so far, it has done well. Sure, at the end of the day it's all a giant cash grab, but so is The Avengers, so we're comparing apples and oranges here. Profit-oriented fruits.<br/><br/>Only a few criticisms, the first of which ignore Peter Parker as a nerd. Kid's got swag in these movies and while as Spider-Man he's got the cockiness/wit DOWN, Peter Parker is still a nerd. You see moments of this nerdiness when he talks to Harry, but other than that, not really.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the character development of Electro and Harry needed some work; Harry more so. While Electro's reasoning is extreme, it is a reason that made sense nonetheless. Jamie Foxx, IMO, did a meh job as Max but a much better job as Electro. Harry was way too rushed but I thought Dane DeHaan still did a good job playing the role. <br/><br/>Cinematography and SFX were great and this edition of Spidey had the best web-slinging. All in all, as mentioned before, my favourite Spidey yet. It wasn't perfect, but it definitely wasn't s*** as some people think. It was a very enjoyable film."
"sabataman","10","14","34","4 May 2014"," Thrilling, but maintains solid plot
","This movie is by far the best Spider-man movie, best Marvel movie, and best Superhero movie since The Dark Knight Rises. Absolutely phenomenal! I am usually not a fan of Marvel movies, as they lack a deep plot and try too hard to wow the crowd with special effects, but this movie made me believe in Marvel once again. All fans of the first trilogy were a bit worried about the reboot. I was one of those people...until I saw the first production. Not overly impressed, but it managed to send me to the second.Probably one of the best decisions I've made in movie aspect of my life since (again) the Dark Knight Rises.

","I truly loved the first The Amazing Spider Man. Judging by how amazing that film was I'm still shocked at how it could possibly surpass that. Great work Marc Webb!! The Amazing Spider Man 2 greeted it's viewers with eye-opening web swinging and action and hilarious comedy. From the beginning clearly shows us That the popular Spider Man has become a web-slinging, crime fighting pro. Spider Man has evidently grown in confidence over the two films but as the frightening new villain Electro and Gwen's plans for the future are a near reality Peter's world goes spiralling. That's my oversimplified synopsis for the story, but almost everything I've written is besides the point. This movie is not just for teenagers and kids but for adults as well.

"trublu215","5","8","17","2 May 2014"," Watch the 34 trailers they have out and you've seen it already.
","The Amazing Spider Man 2 is something that falls short of its predecessor, and hits every branch on the way down. The action is loud, the acting is obnoxious, and the overall story is so jumbled and fractured that it is hard to keep track of what is going on. Andrew Garfield delivers a solid performance as Peter Parker while Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx and even the great Paul Giamatti fall flat...right on their faces. Marc Webb confidently directs his action but leaves the actual story and character development for the sidelines. While it is far from the most important thing a Spider Man movie should have, it would have been nice to have a coherent storyline to adhere too. The technical aspects of the film are somewhat mediocre, the CGI effects often look cheesy (ie. Jamie Foxx as Electro), the editing is very choppy and jumbled. This makes for a frustrating watch to say the least. I would say the biggest problem I had with this film was Dane DeHaan. DeHaan is a gifted and talented individual...but this film makes him look like a soap actor. Marc Webb seemingly fails to direct him as Harry Osborne with any confidence or competence, either or, it remains as the most disappointing and frustrating aspects of this film. Overall, the kids are going to enjoy this one, which isn't saying too much. Between the dozens of trailers they released online, when you walk out of Amazing Spider Man 2, you'll see every beat coming from a mile away. If you have kids, they will love this film and be thoroughly entertained...if you have a brain, you might want to switch it off when watching this and try your hardest to enjoy it because I know I didn't."
"burakberkesu","7","8","17","26 April 2014"," Spider-Man 3? Is that you?
","I am quite a fan of Marvel in general, including the web-slinging hero, yet I have never been amazed enough by the so-called ""Amazing"" Spider-Man movies.<br/><br/>In spite of the fact that I think of Garfield as a by far better Peter Parker than Maguire, I was pretty disappointed about the first film, with the newly-born Spider-Man not recognised enough by the public and news, and the lame scene where he got shot and dramatised it for over five minutes.<br/><br/>These little but essential problems were solved in this one, though it did not feel good either, because they developed way too fast. Considering that Spider-Man always has to fight against the prejudice and misunderstanding of the public and the news, along with his nemeses, it was ridiculous of the public to stand there not frightened, and cheer for the web-slinger after his ""also amazing"" harangue to convince Dillon.<br/><br/>Dillon was supposed to make us feel sorry for him, but it was mostly the script's problem not being able to make that happen. Going from being the fan to being the arch-enemy was way too fast that it could make one say ""WTF?""<br/><br/>The thing was that it felt like the Osborns were the main deal. Harry's two-character personality and DeHaan's acting were quite good, though the relationship between the two ""best"" friends, who have not seen each other in ten, sorry, eight years was too rushed as well. Osborn's plans did not make much sense either; he could have found another way with all the power he had, instead of negotiating with someone who could kill him with just a finger move.<br/><br/>His final arrival at the power station was nonsense, too. Spider-Man has done nothing to make both Electro's and Goblin's hatred to grow so fast, and the timing was way too bad. You could just see what the producers thought: ""We have to kill this Stacy girl, so let's put this Goblin character here. And let's also make him come just after the electric guy dies, so it won't be too much for the Spidey.""<br/><br/>The fight between the two was too short for all the development the Green Goblin had throughout the movie, and it was just to make Gwen's death as similar as possible to the real one. Her death, however, was possibly the best moment of the movie, giving me the worst of all goosebumps.<br/><br/>Stone and Garfield's chemistry is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie, so their scenes are really breathtaking and makes one go ""Aww"" or ""No, he could not have said something that cute!""<br/><br/>Moving forward. Richard Parker's story was unnecessary also. The spider venom working only on Parkers was not that important of an information, and the YouTube video was too private to be a YouTube video. Starting with ""They may say bad things about me"" and giving all the answers Peter was looking for, and then saying that he was the most important thing? Seriously?<br/><br/>The movie, in general, was way too rushed and even worse than Spider-Man 3, considering the overload of characters. The plot was so weak that it was really easy to see what's coming. A Marvel movie is a Marvel movie, so go watch it, but don't await something ""amazing""."
"PeterWorthers","10","23","62","29 June 2014"," Welcome back Spidey!!
","Friendly Neighborhood Spoilers Ahead...<br/><br/>You thought The Amazing Spider-Man was good, you have not seen anything yet.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is back at Spider-Man and is in true from this time. It seems like hes having way too much fun playing the hero, not too bad if you have to have a day job. The role of Peter Parker seems tailor made for him. Emma Stone is back as his love interest Gwen Stacy, their chemistry (they are dating in real life) is plainly visible here. It almost seems like they are not acting towards each other. Again, if you have to have a day job, its not too bad.<br/><br/>But what this movie has in GREAT supply is FUN. What the franchise was missing after the ORIGINAL Spiderman way back in the day. Yes, unlike Toby Macguire, Spider-man is FUN again. Constantly wise cracking, lovable and trying to make his way in a world that doesn't know if it should love or have him, and making fans along the way.<br/><br/>This time Spiderman goes up against Electro, Rhino and The Green Goblin. Each is a newcomer to the franchise, but ones I'm sure we will see again, especially with the namedropping towards the end.<br/><br/>Spider-man I have no problem with at all, its the villains, they are the problem. Its what I call the 'Batman Syndrome' all over again. Let me explain better with my usual rant....<br/><br/>1-Has no one learned from the Batman franchises of old? Too Many villains bog down the story and eventually one gets stepped on by the other. This is the case with this movie also.<br/><br/>2-Rhino, hes in the first 5 minutes and the last 5. Thats it folks. We are not given any time to really care about him, or find him an evil criminal mastermind. Hes just Paul Giamatti doing a really stupid Russian accent. Thats it. Hes just there for comedy at the start and at the end you wonder 'How did he break out? How did he get the suit? Why does he hate Spider-man so much? There has to be a bigger and better reason for him being around in the next one' <br/><br/>3-Electro. First off, he felt like Mr.Freeze from Batman and Robin(Almost looked like him too)with the corny electric jokes. ""It's shocking"" ""You'll get a charge out of this"" ""You called the thunder, heres the lightning"" WE GET IT! ELECTRICITY! Calm down man! <br/><br/>4-Electro again, his mild mannered self Max Dillon seemed a whole lot like the mild mannered Edward Nygma (from Batman Forever, thus why I call it the 'Batman Syndrome') Works for company on an experimental project, stepped on by his bosses, no one pays him any attention, then Batman..er Spider-Man shows up and he becomes obsessed with him. Then a tragic 'accident' turns him into a bad guy hell bend on getting revenge on the hero that 'ignored him'. Nope, never been done before.<br/><br/>5-The Norman Osborne angle was a little strange. ""Hey Pete, haven't seen you in years and years, but come on over, let me show you top secret projects my company is working on and tell you that I'm dying."" Save it for Maury, huh.<br/><br/>6-Peters father, first in the plane before they died: Was he James Bond in a former life? For a scientist type hes got some Liam Neeson moves and keeps on going and going like the Energizer bunny. That and for a plane crashing, he sure had really good Wi-Fi to upload all those files.<br/><br/>7-Second with Peters father, he had this secret lab in the subway in a former presidential boxcar. IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET AND NO ONE ELSE KNEW ABOUT OR FOUND IT? But Peter does a 5 minute search (2 to find the answer and 3 to check FaceBook) and finds it like that? New York police must be the worst.<br/><br/>8-The Green Goblin at the power plant. He looks at Spidey and Gewn for one second and 'You're Peter Parker!'. Honestly, that could have been a coincidence, or if it was that easy how come no one else figured it out sooner. Hell, Harry had Spider-man in his house only a few inches from his face talking to him and STILL had no idea it was Peter.<br/><br/>9-Gwens death. I was glad to see this ACTUALLY happened like in the comics, but also it added realism to the movie. I don't care what super hero you are, you will not always get the bad guy and save everyone. Frist Captain Stacy in the first one and now Gwen. WHat keeps us coming back to Spider-Man over and over is the fact that hes us. Just a dude who wants to make a difference any way he ca and not always being able to live up to everyones expectations of him.<br/><br/>10-That kid at the end. Really? The kid gets under a barricade and no one runs after him? The crowd and police just stand there like 'Wait Billy don't go...Oh well'. Plus, the police are having this huge shoot out only a few feet from millions of innocent by standards and apparently a really crappy barricade? <br/><br/>Having said that, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was AWESOME! It is the reason we go to see movies and the reason Spider-man will always keep bringing us back to him. Good old fashioned super hero fun."

","After the less amazing and darker reboot of the Marvel Spidey franchise, Spider-Man is back again with a sequel, swinging between skyscrapers in New York City, with his perfectly-designed costume. It seems that Spidey's costume has evolved throughout the years...this newly-designed costume finally resembles the costume he always wears in the comics.<br/><br/>Moreover, it is noticeable that Spidey's CGI renders have improved a lot as we see Spidey swings by on the streets of New York City. We also get to see what Spider-Man really does in battle - always jokes while moving swiftly with his super-reflexes. Garfield and Stone have terrific on- screen chemistry as a couple and they have a few genuinely funny and heartfelt moments together in the film. The film does come with a major shocking plot twist at the end (not so much for the fans who knew Spidey for a long time though)<br/><br/>Despite the CGI and costume design improvements, plot twist and a strong relationship between Garfield and Stone, the entire plot structure of the film is a disaster as things just keeps on happening from scene to scene. The film is overstuffed with various subplots and the pieces don't fit together nicely, without a central story tying them together: the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents, Peter and Gwen's complicated relationship, the dual-sided nature of Harry and Peter's friendship, development of the new villains - Electro, Rhino and Green Goblin, Sinister Six setup, Aunt May and Peter's relationship after Uncle Ben's death...all in one film.<br/><br/>The villains' motivations are fuzzy and poorly conceived. It's a pity to see such potential go to waste. Max/Electro and Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino barely have character development in the film at all. Their character arcs aren't properly fleshed out as intended and they're barely connected to the main protagonist's character arc. You won't feel anything missing if they're both completely removed from the story, since it doesn't affect the overall plot of the film at all. It's understandable that the purpose of Rhino's inclusion to the film is for the next sequel's setup. However, it seems that the inclusion of Electro in the film serves no purpose other than to add more exciting, extravagant action fight scenes for the audience to watch. While the extravagance of the action scenes make the film more entertaining, it feels cartoony and not realistic at all.<br/><br/>Worst, the tone of the film shifts drastically back and forth between fun, not-so-serious and entertaining to emotional, serious and dark, which takes some time for the audience to adjust and keep up with, hurts the film a lot. When there's a tender, intimate moment between Peter and Gwen happening in the film and you start to feel the emotions coming, the film robs them away by abruptly shifting to an Electro scene, a clue to Peter's parent disappearance appears, or another Harry scene.<br/><br/>As a long-time Spidey fan, I personally feel that the film fails to capture the most influential, emotional and devastating moment in Peter Parker's life before meeting his lifelong partner, Mary Jane in the future. It lacks the much-needed emotional buildup to deliver the punch in the end, which is not present due to the horrendous plot structure and inconsistent tonal shifts of the film. The various subplots constantly interfere and collide with each other because that's how it was structured in the script. While seemingly looks good in script, it just doesn't translate well on screen.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 repeats the same mistakes as Iron Man 2, too many heavy-handed foreshadowing for future sequels, instead of making it a compelling stand-alone film. While the sequel is better than its predecessor (the first Amazing Spider-Man film) in many ways, it's still not the hands-down, best Spidey film that many fans would hoped to see.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Although the story has a terrible narrative structure, I believe the central theme of the story should be dealing with life's two biggest questions:<br/><br/>Are you capable enough to deal with the repercussions of taking chances, knowing that they might happen in the future? Are you willing to accept the consequences of not taking those chances and in turn living regretfully because of it?<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-amazing-spider-man- 2.html"
"anilgamer","6","9","20","1 May 2014"," ""Not the treatment our friendly neighborhood Spidey deserves.""
","High-octane action sequences and mind-blowing fight scenes were not enough to save the day from loosely presented content and clumsy story. At first, I was pretty excited to experience the new Spidey movie which was creating a lot of buzz. After all the trailers indicating 3 overwhelming Super-villains in one movie and announcements like ""HIS GREATEST BATTLE BEGINS"", I was quite sure that they must have learnt from the shortcomings of the previous installment and right choices will be taken for creating a better sequel. BUT, I was WRONG. This movie moves away from the being called a Superhero movie. With all the right content in the basket to make a superb 142 min blockbuster, the movie fails to pull the right chord and falls straight in the category of average. The 142 min run-time felt stretched and slow at times as the story presents emotional melodrama most of the time rather than putting other important and relevant stuff. A movie which had a potential to be the best Spidey movie till date but in the end it turns out to be a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>Would like to mention some positives after all that rage outburst:<br/><br/>The 3D is really Awesome. The chemistry between Gwen and Peter. Spiderman feels fantastic. The best on-screen Spidey display till date. And last but not the least, the only part true to the word amazing were the breathtaking action sequences and fight scenes. Superb, fantastic and mind-blowing. Especially, the electro-soundtrack combo was too good. Really liked that concept. And that's it.<br/><br/>Now lets look at the lots and loads of shortcomings: > It's a Superhero movie, Not a Chick Flick - How about putting some more time in developing the Super-Villains with story and character rather than keeping them on standby. > Creating the tense hero-villain relation which spreads the sense of threat and calls for Superhero treatment. Even this core stuff is seriously missing. > Peter Parker is a boy who tries to balance Spidey responsibilities and life as a normal guy. One who cannot hold on to a regular job, is short of cash, gets exploited at Daily Bugle by J. Jonah Jameson and lots of other troubles. That boy was nowhere to be found. > The Super-villain Trio - Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino was completely wasted. > Electro as the main antagonist is seriously wasted. His story and character development falls short and heavily underdeveloped. > Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/ Green Goblin felt like one of the things done right in this movie. But the screen-time and space, which a villain like Green Goblin deserves is messed up. > Rhino is nothing more than a cameo. Simply putting, I didn't feel that sense of threat from Super-villains which is at core of any Superhero movie.<br/><br/>When it got over, I was blank and disappointed. Tried to gather my thoughts and felt that lots of things were pushed and tried to fit in a single movie. But the effort to tie them together failed miserably due to over-emphasis on the emotions part taking away the space from more important and relevant stuff. One more thing which I would like to mention was the kid scene towards the end - the only emotion which was genuinely felt. Want to focus on emotions, bring more like this one instead of going for melodramatic ones. Was this made just to set table for the next one?? Was this a remake tried making a bold move to make a difference. Well if yes, it Does Not.<br/><br/>Verdict: This one was better than the sequel but still disappointing. Feels like a rushed movie which tries to aim lots of targets with a single bullet but fails big time due to heavy overdose of Peter and Gwen Melodrama. I went to see a superhero movie, not a chick flick running around action sequences and wasted super-villains. This is not the Spider-Man movie fans deserve. A one-time watch which will fade from the memories soon."
"dmny92","8","24","66","13 May 2014"," My favorite Spider-Man movie so far!
","People who criticize this movie either can't move on from Raimi's trilogy or just wanted to see a regular action flick which happens to feature a superhero. Everyone else should love this, for so many reasons.<br/><br/>I have seen many complaints regarding the amount of time that was spent developing the Peter-Gwen relationship. I found that to be the strongest point of the movie (same as it was for TASM1), mainly because of their surreal chemistry. Emma Stone is adorable, they're a sweet couple (this is coming from a guy, OK?). I have never watched a superhero movie where the ""regular guy"" scenes were just as (if not even more) interesting to me than the ""superhero"" scenes. SPOILER: Gwen's death scene was truly heartbreaking (both well-written and greatly acted by Andrew Garfield, who basically had to watch the most important thing in his world fading away through his fingers).<br/><br/>Spider-Man's trademark light-hearted comments were put to good use on multiple occasions (both as Spider-Man and as Peter - his childish excuses to Aunt May were hilarious) and actually managed to amuse me (unlike most comedies that try so hard to get a laugh from you but fail to do so).<br/><br/>Visuals wise, the movie uses more daytime scenes than TASM1 and most of the CGI looks very natural (by today's standards), unlike Raimi's trilogy (subpar even up to that date). Spider-Man's suit is the best representation so far, as well. The small, yellow eyes from TASM1's suit were replaced by bigger, white eyes, the overall suit design being both classic (almost straight out of the comics) and modern at the same time.<br/><br/>As for the audio, lots to praise as well. First of all, Andrew Garfield has mastered the Spidey voice. He sounds young and joyful, as he should. The soundtrack (composed by Hans Zimmer - everything this man touches is pure gold) is heart-pounding, emotional, it flows with every scene. There's Electro's suite which is goosebumps inducing every time the dubstep mixed with the whispering voices starts filling the theater room. Then there's the emotional piano sequences, that fit perfectly with the Peter-Gwen scenes. The soundtrack feels like part of the movie and not some random generic music added into the final stage of editing.<br/><br/>Villains, the necessary evil in every superhero movie. Many people complained that Max Dillon's transformation was rushed and unbelievable. I disagree. During the first half of the movie we can see multiple events that build up Max's frustration and you could tell that at some point he was going to crack, he just didn't have the means to unleash his frustration and anger, prior to his accident. When he becomes Electro, Spider-Man's betrayal (as his messed up mind perceived it) was the drop that spilled the cup. He's a victim, but he turns into a threat, so Spider-Man had to deal with him, helped by Gwen (who isn't just Peter's girlfriend, but the force driving him forward as both Peter and Spider-Man).<br/><br/>Then there's Harry Osborn (whose encounter with Peter was believable and beautifully done as well). He's desperate for saving his life, he feels betrayed by his best friend (unlike Max being delusional, they were actually friends), as well. His motives make sense. His transformation into the Green Goblin is raw, powerful and frightening. No more silly costume or cheesy voice delivery (sorry, Sam Raimi and Willem Dafoe).<br/><br/>Rhyno was more of a filler, I was really surprised to see such a small screen time from him (but I didn't feel he needed more, having Electro and Green Goblin already).<br/><br/>If you're trying to nitpick, you can probably find some minor plot holes or things that you think should've been done differently. I'm not saying that it's a perfect movie (no movie is flawless), but I consider it to be an almost perfect superhero movie (faithful to the source materials, checking all the right boxes on my list of things I wanted to see). During its runtime - 142 minutes - so glad it wasn't shorter, I basically relived my childhood (I grew up with the 1990s Spider- Man cartoons and reading Spider-Man comic books). That's what good movies do, they make you forget about real life while you're watching them.<br/><br/>Marc Webb achieved what Cristopher Nolan did with his Dark Knight trilogy, taking all the needed elements that fans love, giving them the right touch and creating the ultimate Spider-Man experience for us to enjoy (web swinging in 3D genuinely felt like you were on Spidey's back). I found TASM1 to be solid, but TASM2 is superior in many ways.<br/><br/>Don't trust the naysayers, watch it!"
"sopheywatson","10","31","89","25 April 2014"," Amazing!!!
","This movie is awesome!!! Action packed, emotional and just totally kick-ass! Unbelievable how much action was condensed into just one movie. Much, much better than the original spider-man sequel. I love how in the re-boot you learn so much more about oscorp and what actually happened to his parents and their past. Its good how they brought in Gwen first too, instead of MJ Its pretty cool how they're trying to stick to the comics as much as possible with these new movies! The ending was heartbreaking i kept hoping it wasn't real but it was :( Cannot wait for the the 3rd and 4th installments. Just hope when they bring in MJ she's less annoying and way more prettier than the MJ Kirsten Dunst played!! MJ will always be a Gwen backup, Gwen is his true love, his biggest regret and his biggest what if. Spidey just needs to join forces with the avengers now!"
"Impsman","6","10","23","22 April 2014"," Good but underwhelming
","I have just got back from seeing the Amazing Spider Man 2 here in the UK. Overall enjoyable. Storyline is good and expands on a few things from the first film. Performances from the main cast are good,especially DeHann as Harry Osborn. Some of the supporting roles could have been 'played down'a little though ( the governor/scientist in the prison being a prime example). However whilst watching the film I couldn't help thinking that I had seen the film already. Basically there is so much that has been put out online and in the numerous trailers that have been done, that i felt that I had seen every set piece already. This spoiled the enjoyment for me. I realise that I could go in without having viewed any of the saturation coverage for this film over the last six months or so, but sometimes I wish that the film makers would keep some of the best things back for the actual film. So a solid 6/10 rather than a probable 8 or 9 if they had kept some surprises for us."
"santi-reis","Null","10","23","18 April 2014"," Better, bigger, more ambitious and emotionally heavier
","As the story unfolds, and all conspiracies behind Oscorp unwind, the life of our lovable web-swinger gets more adrenaline full and also more complicated. There is a bit of a sense of DeJa Vu, specially when Peter Parker is trying to balance his personal life and his super hero life. But the aspect in which this movie really shines (like his ancestor) is in the characters, however this time the emotional weight is much more present,and the scale of both the drama and action is much bigger. Andrew and Emma were just as great as in the previous movie, and the chemistry between them is fantastic. Jaime Fox also nailed it as Electro, even thou the character itself was not the best written character, but his performance was so great that i was able to overcome the writing. Dane DeHann was equally great as the Green Goblin, at first i didn't like the idea of Harry being the Green Goblin instead of Norman Osborn, but it was a good choice and it matched perfectly with the plot and tone of the movie.(Also Dane has a knack for playing psychopaths) As to be expected there are plenty CGI scenes but it really didn't bother me because the action sequences were done in a very creative way. The Score, composed by Hans Zimmer,is amazing and somewhat contemporary, so it fits the themes of each character and moment. Overall the movie was much more intense and heavier than the first installment, as our main character deals not only with supernatural challenges but also emotional dilemmas."
"baehr_adam","10","22","60","1 May 2014"," Imax is the way to go!!!!!
","I just gone done watching the IMAX premiere of ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" and it was SUPERB. I won't put any spoilers in here but it is def the best Spider-Man movie to date. Marc Webb is really coming along in his directing of Spider-Man and did an Amazing job with casting especially casting Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn or AKA ""The Green Goblin"" which BTW is my favorite villain of all time. Anyways the acting was excellent as well as the story if you pay attention there are a ton of references to a ton of stuff in the universe. The action was top-notch in every way possible it blew the 1st film out of the water in that respect and I can't wait for the next film. In my opinion as an avid Spider-Man fan and not being biased being that Spider-Man is my favorite superhero it is a must see movie hands down!!!!!"

","Good on ya Mark Webb, you earned it, you nailed it. To keep it short, this movie IS amazing. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it is indeed marvellous!! After watching this movie I was just positively speechless. Whatta a breathtaking experience it was; from Spider man's amazing web swinging in 3D,incredible action scenes, splendid cinematography, emotion and seriously great acting. This second installment comes with a gigantic thud of awesomeness, surpassing the previous 'The Amazing Spider man' to a devastatingly far extent. Although I don't know much about the comics, this really was a marvellous movie, a definite must to see. Greatness can only merely be told online, but not effectively enough, especially for a movie of this caliber. Besides every other element of this movie, it truly is a 'visual spectacle'. Oh, Mark Webb you sly bugger, you NAILED it, good job."
"nicolechan916","9","12","29","16 June 2014"," Great effects, character developments and storytelling.
","This film was pretty amazing. The action scenes did not have many kick- ass choreography, but that's because Spider-Man mainly uses strategies and shoots webs to fight his opponent. That was still pretty cool. The slow-motion scenes were a good addition too.<br/><br/>I feel that the characters matured a lot from the first film, and that the actors/actresses grew more comfortable playing them. Spider-man (like Superman) is one of those heroes where their stories are mostly based on them juggling being a hero as well as a boyfriend, and this conflict was portrayed well by Garfield and Stone.<br/><br/>Garfield's Spider-Man is known for being witty and making comedic remarks in the face of seriousness. His humour really adds to the character and makes him seem more human. Maybe that's why he wasn't included in The Avengers; because he's more human than the rest of them, and has had no proper training. Well, I hope they do include him in the next Avengers film, it would be so much more epic.<br/><br/>One thing I did not quite like, was how there was more than one villain in this. It felt like it was building up to something with this one villain, and then a few others turn up. It just felt a bit rushed at the end. The other two villains had short screen times, but I guess they'll turn up in the third movie. But it also seemed so convenient that these villains would just appear. Like one bad encounter with Spider-Man and they would instantly turn into the bad guy. I don't know. Maybe that's how humans think, through recent events rather than the past.<br/><br/>This film also showed quite a lot of background story and that helped me to understand more of what happened. That was a good touch. Many good touches in this film, and was pretty amazing overall. I cried twice throughout the movie. I don't know why, it's just the feels.<br/><br/>Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com"
"chadclca-990-801677","10","25","70","1 May 2014"," Its a movie based on a comic, not a prize winning novel
","While the critics have generally panned this movie, I cannot see how anyone could have seen this movie and not had a lot of fun. Go see it in IMAX 3D, and notice how brilliantly sequenced the action is. Sure, there is nothing you can imagine now that can't be put on the big-screen thanks to incredibly talented CGI artists, but I think its the way that the camera moves through the action, and the action moves through the frame that makes this an incredible achievement in digital artistry, and there are some truly great moments in the acting as well. I will concede that the tortured soul version of peter parker trademarked by the intolerable Toby McGuire depiction bumps that old bruise occasionally, but there is more momentum in this incarnation pushing the action along than there were in previous movies of the same characters. Go see it."
"Ben-Mariscal-937-155436","10","28","80","21 April 2014"," Spider-Man is back and better then before
","Andrew Garfield returns as the web-slinger, facing off against 3 new enemies. Lonely Oscorp employee and spider-man fanatic Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) who through a freak accident turns into blue villain Electro. Old friend turned green goblin Harry Osborn (Dane dehann) and Rhino (Paul Giamatti). Also returning in peters love interest Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone). One thing I loved was the emotional depth of Peter and Gwen's relationship with fantastic performances by Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield. The action was great and spaced out, and also a fantastic performance by Dane dehann's creepily twisted yet enjoyable to watch Harry Osborn. I was also able to feel sympathetic to Max Dillon/electro. All of this culminates in an emotionally charged ending that is sad quite unexpected to fans who haven't read the comics. Although the one criticism is that rhino and green goblin didn't get enough screen time, but other then that it was a very enjoyable ride. Pros: .Great chemistry between actors . Good action Cons: .rhino and goblin didn't get enough screen time, felt like a cameo."
"stephenkuykendall3","10","27","77","30 April 2014"," Best Spidey Yet
","Best one so far. I have no idea where all this fuss is coming from, all this hatred? I don't get it... It was a damn fun movie, I had a blast watching it and, come on, this is the most emotionally demanding Spider- Man as well. Everything upon both series has been improved upon in my opinion. Sure it wasn't perfect, but I do like it more than Captian American 2 although slightly. The tone was perfect for the earl 90s spider-man and ultimate spider-man thrown together. Its a new take on everything and I am enjoying it just as I honestly enjoyed Superior Spider- man.<br/><br/>I will be honestly, I've enjoyed all of them for what they were. They were fun, no reason to take them so dang serious. Its a fresh take on Spider-man and not just a rehash of old ideas, this was the one that has now officially set it apart from the previous franchise and all other Spider-man cannon. Face it, Spider-Man has been rebooted countless times and all of them are different iterations from the stories told before with some new sprinkled on top. This is no different. Raimi was its own thing too apart from all other cannon, nothing escapes this. So there is no perfect iteration anymore, just individual opinion. This is no where near Batman and Robin territory that's ridiculous. In my opinion its up there with Iron Man and Spider-Man 2, even The Dark Knight. In fact I would rather watch this than The Dark Knight if not only because it is a much more fun film. Calm down. Its a great movie. Go see it and have fun!<br/><br/>Biggest gripe: all the stuff from the trailers cut out that I loved, but oh well. Its a movie, not the second coming.<br/><br/>As far as the hatred, sad human constantly searching for a nostalgia high because they can't move on to the future."
"rickygrimez","10","30","87","3 May 2014"," Best Spider-Man Film Yet!!!
","Well, for those of you who have not yet seen The Amazing Spider-Man 2, WOW, is all I can say! I will gladly set forth my opinion on what I boldly claim as not only the Best Spider-Man film yet, but also the Best Superhero movie EVER MADE! And shall do so in a few basic points.<br/><br/>1. Phenomenal 3D Experience- Now this is actually an important factor nowadays and should be rated. After all the paying viewers expect a worthy performance in the 3D aspect of the film to justify the added cost of the ticket. The first Amazing Spider-Man had the DNA of a great 3D film, yet as an audience we were not given the full potential of what Marc Webb could compose with this technology. On this movie it was evident from start to finish that he has mastered this craft. As far as comparison this 3D was far superior to that of Avengers.<br/><br/>2. Authenticity to the Comic book- I truly don't want to include a SPOILER, but let's put it this way, the characters all stayed true to at least some version of a Spider-Man comic incarnation. For instance Aunt May doesn't become The Sandman or any of that stuff. Even Spidey's playfulness and bad puns draw you into the nostalgia of the comics.<br/><br/>3. Great Acting- The performances in this flesh out the realism of these characters. There are actions and consequences, power and responsibility the whole way through. The actors make you love this story. There are some emotional crossroads in it for everyone and it's incredible how seamlessly and uncomplicated it all unfolds.<br/><br/>4. You Leave the Theater Satisfied- When this movie is over, not only do you have to contemplate the events you saw on screen, but also what you anticipate for the sequel.<br/><br/>5. It's Spider-Man- Consistently an $800MIL per movie franchise it speaks for itself on the Spider-Man status as a Superhero to the fans of Marvel. He's the ambassador in many ways, and with his potential already there, this film follows through and delivers on that promise, ""Does Whatever a Spider Can!"""
"zvnuvz-snvus","8","18","48","15 May 2014"," Amazing Spiders!
","It is always fun to see how a superhero with superpowers manages to fight crime and save one pass another good citizen. In parallel, it is possible to see how the strength vanishes in an instant. Like any human, Spiderman has to face himself and against his impulses. If you've ever wondered how the world is seen from a hero proportionately Realistically, this movie can give you that idea, and beyond, to feel the experience firsthand. The Amazing Spiderman 2 reaches as intense and dramatic moments that involve you in the story to the point of wanting involve and make your own decisions. If you want to know what I mean, go see this excellent sequel and feel what it is to live as Spiderman."

","The amazing spiderman 2 was a sequel that I found very impressive. Im very glad they went and used the source material as much as possible and I highly recommend this film. Was the most fun I've had at the cinema in a while. Whomever said it was the ""Batman & Robin"" of the spiderman movies needs to be checked mentally and needs to learn how to have fun at the movies. I can see how the movie wouldn't do compared to the new captain America or thor. And it shouldn't be compared. Spiderman is his own universe and character, so he should be treated as such. If anyone wants a great spiderman film, with loads of fun and insane action, I highly recommend the amazing spiderman 2."

","Great movie guys, I think Andrew Garfield is the right actor for Spider-Man. I saw it 5 times, I really love this movie. I want to act in this movie, I like Spider-Man since a little child. Andrew Garfield is the right play role for Spider-Man he act very good and very powerful. Electro was good creature in Spider-Man. Next Spider-Man should have some new creatures and more powerful creatures. Spider-Man is for all ages. Many people say that the spider-man is just the same, the same story, he fight with some creatures and then you know that he will win. He will stay alive. I don't agree with that. I think that every Spider-Man has different story. But to see that different story, you have to look inside the movie."
"Hellmant","10","21","58","7 May 2014"," Extremely satisfying!
","'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Big budget sequel to 2012's 'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN' (which is a reboot to director Sam Raimi's film trilogy, released in 2002 through 2007). It's once again directed by Marc Webb and stars Andrew Garfield as the popular Marvel Comics character. Garfield's real life girlfriend Emma Stone also returns as Peter Parker's main squeeze Gwen Stacey. Scenes were shot introducing Shailene Woodley as his other main love interest, from the comics, Mary Jane Watson (but they were cut in a decision to save that character for a later film). Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan and Paul Giamatti all play new villains in the movie and Sally Field, Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz return as members of the Parker family. The screenplay was written this time around by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt also co-wrote the last Spider-Man movie and Krutzman and Orci are known for co-writing lots of popular sci-fi flicks (like the first two installments in the 'STAR TREK' reboot series and 'TRANSFORMERS' franchise). This installment is meant to setup not only two more planned sequels (in the next four years) but two spinoffs as well ('VENOM' and 'SINISTER SIX'). I found it to be immensely entertaining and (being a huge fan of the characters) extremely satisfying as well! <br/><br/>As the film opens Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man (Garfield), is taking down a Russian mobster known as Aleksei Sytsevich (Giamatti). In the process he rescues a nerdy and extremely insecure OsCorp electrical engineer, named Max Dillon (Foxx), who becomes a huge fan of his for it. This is all on his way to his own high school graduation, in which he misses his girlfriend Gwen Stacy's (Stone) speech. Due to his constant guilt, over a promise he made her dead father (Denis Leary), Gwen brakes up with him. Parker then continues to fight crime while stalking Gwen, dealing with his Aunt May (Field) constantly pestering him and further investigating what really happened to his parents. At the same time Max has an accident at OsCorp that turns him into an electrically charged supervillain and Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (DeHaan) returns to Manhattan to see his dying father (Chris Cooper). Things get really messy when Harry learns that Spider-Man's blood might be the only thing that can save him from his father's same fate.<br/><br/>The movie has received a lot of mediocre to negative reviews from critics but has mostly been praised by comic book fans of the character. I never read the comics regularly but I've always been a big fan of the superhero (due to his relatability) and this movie is everything I would want from a Spider-Man flick (I've heard that it's the most faithful of the entire franchise as well). I thought the filmmakers did a really good job of developing each character (as well as their drama) and all the actors are great in their roles. Giamatti's villain isn't developed at all but he's not supposed to be (he's just introduced as setup for a later installment/spin off). Foxx does something comedic with his role, at first, (that's kind of reminiscent to what his former fellow castmate on 'IN LIVING COLOR', Jim Carrey, did in 'BATMAN FOREVER') but he turns into a really frightening and equally sympathetic bad guy as well. DeHaan continues to bare a striking resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio and he shows a lot of talent while doing so. It's Garfield that really shines though; he is the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he and Stone do have awesome chemistry together. Webb's direction is cool, the script is clever and well thought out and the action scenes and visual effects are to die for! I really loved Raimi's first two 'SPIDER-MAN' movies but Webb's films (so far) are equally as impressive. I can't see why any fan of the character or film franchise wouldn't be more than thrilled with this installment.

"melgarcia40","4","20","55","8 May 2014"," The amazingly awful Spider-Man
","Simply awful. The dialogs are some of the worst I've heard, the characters are underdeveloped, the villains are cartoonish... The break-up dialog at the beginning is appalling: ""We have to breakup, Gwen"" ""No Peter, we can do IT"" ""But I promised your father I would let you out of it, I can't keep on doing it"" ""Peter, I am breaking up, IT is over""... Gwen, that is exactly what he said at the beginning... The story of Harry is rushed and Peter's reluctance to give him Blood has no grounding. He and Peter are supposed to be best friends but haven't seen or talked to each other in 8 years. The plan to fire Harry from Oscorp is stupid. Gwen leaves for England after one day: apparently looking for an apartment, arranging the transfer of your personal stuff to another country can be done by snapping your fingers. Spiderman's lines when arresting the villains are cheesy and lame. The transitions between scenes are badly handled. The movie is far too long and most scenes are filler and lackluster Gwen's valedictorian's speech is preachy could never have been written by a girl supposedly in High School I almost left the theater. What a waste of good actors, who couldn't save this mess The only good point: killing Gwen."

","This movie was worth waiting for! I've been waiting for it since March! This movie starts with Richard and Mary parker on a plane then it crashes! I think the final battle was rushed. I think that green goblin should have had at least 20 minutes of screen time the movie should have been at least 10 minutes longer than it was. Electro was defeated fast. I know it sounds like I'm complaining about this movie but here are the great parts. I felt like this was the dark knight of spiderman I think the amazing spiderman series is so much better than the old one! Electro was a great villain Gwen's death was sad and green goblin was like joker. I think rhino shouldn't have been in this movie and green goblin should have had a second battle with spiderman I actually felt sorry for max Dillon and I loved him as a villain even though electro was the main villain green goblin effected peter's life the most I see why they rushed the final battle down to like 8 minutes I think this movie deserved to be way longer but I still loved it I think Marc Webb was a great director I give it a ten!"

","Hi Just went yesterday to see the new spider man movie and let me just say it is really not amazing. The dialogs are boring and it feels that they are taken from a very bad intimation of twilight. the Two main Characters Emma Stone is a great actress but it seems that since the start of this movies her acting level has really gone down and that is coming from a fan.Her partner in life and crime which is this movie Andrew Garfield who is our hero should really take some acting classes because he is single handedly destroying spider man's charter for everyone, why doe's his spider man charter always cries but always, Tobias Maguire spider man never cried what's with the sissy attitude,the amazing spider man is the crying spider man and he needs some spine and fast, not against his enemy's but against the lady in his life. with out the special effect's and Jammie fox and sealy field to save this movie, all of us at the theater would have walked out and demanded our money back. I hope the studious will save face and stop this remaking of spider man because if a third installment goes out, there will be no hope for our friendly spider at all."
"CinemaClown","Null","7","15","9 May 2014"," Expected It To Be An Utter Crap & It Truly Lived Up To That Prediction.
","Expected it to be an utter crap & it truly lived up to that prediction. After opening with a pretty good prologue, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a downhill trip from there & follows Peter Parker enjoying his life fighting crime as Spider-Man but having hallucinations of Gwen Stacy's deceased dad whenever he is with her. But soon he has other things to deal with as new villains in town arrive starting with a Spider-Man obsessed fan who after a mishap mutates into Electro. Next comes Harry Osborn who later transforms into Green Goblin & last we have Rhino but the less I talk about this ass-wimp, the better it is.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb tries to do so many things at once in this sequel that the movie as a whole becomes entangled in its own webbing & not a single one of its sub-plots come out as well as one would've liked. The screenplay is dull, camera-work is more focused on 3D experience than contributing to the story, editing leaves so many unnecessary scenes in tact, VFX is where most of its quarter-billion budget seems to have been expended, the entire plot has no sense of direction, characterization is poor & even Hans Zimmer's music fails to deliver this time.<br/><br/>The very few things likable about it is the new Spidey costume which now closely resembles the comic books look, the Gwen/Peter chemistry that's on or off throughout the film, Peter/Harry friendship that should've been further explored & the scenes involving Aunt May which feel most authentic on an emotional scale. The recurring cast has done the same job they did in the last film, adding nothing new to talk about in this one. Jamie Foxx hams his way through as Electro, Dane DeHaan has better moments as Harry than Green Goblin & Paul Giamatti's Rhino is far worse than imaginable.<br/><br/>Oh n don't be blinded by the false advertisement as Electro plays the main villain, Green Goblin is present only during the final moments but not for too long & Rhino almost doesn't even exist in this film. On an overall scale, the 2nd chapter of this needlessly rebooted franchise delivers another lackluster cinematic experience & proves that the team has learned nothing from the mistakes it made in the last movie. Adding more extravagant elements into its production only to later end up choking on it, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is far less amazing than what it's selling itself as. Do yourself a favour & waste your money on something else.<br/><br/>Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"
"blufrog49","6","7","15","7 May 2014"," Busy as a Bee--oh a Spider
","While this movie is enjoyable as an action film, with some sentimentality thrown in for good measure, it just seemed to me to be trying TOO hard. There are too many plots that are loosely interwoven, and waaaay too many coincidences.<br/><br/>I was offended that Jamie Foxx, the only main black character--SPOILER--was portrayed first as a social misfit and then as supremely evil. Maybe I am seeing too much into this, but it reminded me of old movies, black vs white, evil vs good.<br/><br/>The acting, when the cast is allowed to act, is quite good. Is anyone else getting tired of the transformers in so many of these films?"
"shivam-hora","6","7","15","6 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider-man? Naah
","I am a big fan of the spider man series, the previous one and not the 'amazing spider man' .. Two years ago when i went to see the first amazing spider man, i was let down by both, the story-line and the antagonist. I returned to theater this week in hope of seeing some improvement in our kid Peter. <br/><br/>Not as disappointed as by the previous one but i wasn't too happy either. The story-line was still a little bit rushed and the villains , though vicious were not the 'sandman' or 'green goblins' , we had come to know from the original spidey series. Acting was justified to the story-line and direction was as expected, good. Andrew Garfield , however 'amazing' can never match the character done beautifully by Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>Among other flaws, this movie is incomplete emotionally and humorously. The pros of this movie... Emma stone i guess. She portrays Gwen Stacy's character quite nicely . Jamie foxx's potential , in my opinion has been wasted, he seems like a villain whom we all know can be destroyed(again nothing like sandman) and we do not worry over him that much. Dane Dee Han does a childish Harry Osborn , obviously Franco was wayyy better.<br/><br/>The action scenes were good and they are one of the reason i gave this flick a 6 rather than a 5.<br/><br/>Maybe if for a second you forget the original series by sam raimi, you might end up liking this movie , maybe not.<br/><br/>In my opinion if you are not in a rush for a superhero movie, wait for x-men days of future past. If you are, sling to your nearest theaters."
"extinct22","5","7","15","5 May 2014"," I would say it's closer to a 5.5
","I'll start off by saying I didn't hate it. This review will go over both the good & the bad. Good: 1) I liked the chemistry between Gwen & Peter. Because of their off-screen relationship, they really had some touching on-screen moments. 2) Several of the other actors in movie had strong performances. 3) I like most of the special effects. 4) They followed the source material with Gwen's death, which has caused a lot of debate on how she actually died.<br/><br/>Bad: 1) It seemed rushed. Not the Peter & Gwen parts, but the villain development. Harry Osborne went from Peter Parker's BFF to psychopath in the blink of an eye. 2) Although the villains looked cool, their back stories & reasons for being evil were ridiculous. Electro hated Spider-Man & wanted to kill millions of people because Spider-Man forgot his name (Which isn't even that crazy considering his appearance drastically changed when he was electrocuted & turned blue). The Goblin was also behind the plot to murder a lot of people because Spider-Man refused to give him his blood, which was for his own good. ASM2 is a prime example of terrible writing. 3) The tone of the movie bounced around too much. There were several parts that were hammy & reminded me of Batman & Robin (Hint: The truck scene at the beginning with the vials was terrible & cartoony). Paul Giamatti was way over the top with his performance. Then there were other parts that were very dramatic, which were good, but they didn't match with the hammy parts. 4) Sally Fields backstory about working as a nurse was pointless & stupid. It served no purpose & took time away that could have been used to build up Electro or Goblin or anyone else. 5) The scene with the planes on a collision path was pointless too. I understand why they did it, but just feel they could have done much better if they took a different approach. They did it to show the audience that people were in real danger from Electro despite the fact that he was miles away from any one in an electric junkyard. Regardless, the scene was executed poorly. 6) There were other things that were done poorly with the movie, but the ones above are the main things."

"thealphakeno","8","13","33","21 May 2014"," Just like Ironman 2. Important story yet not entertaining.
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 earns mixed emotion based on my perspective while watching it. It was a great film but lacks of great fighting scenes. There are some fighting scenes and the Green Goblin Vs Spider- man is the best of all but only 40% are action, 60% are just conversation.<br/><br/>I do understand that due to marketing and a way on how they going to show how Gwen Stacy is important to Peter, and she needs to be accepted and attached by the audience.<br/><br/>The acting was perfect. The story was dark which a new concept for Spider-man series. The death of Gwen Stacy gave me pain inside me. Andrew Garfield's acting really got me. The villains are well used in this one. Electro looks cool with the effects but still boring and same as Rhino. Green Goblin fascinates me although it was just like the same Goblin from previous spider-man franchise. <br/><br/>TASM2 just a backbone of the series, not that entertaining but it was important part of the story that needs to be broaden in the future film."

"tylercolon07","8","12","30","16 May 2014"," Though spoiled for me, TASM2 did not disappoint.
","After almost two weeks of not seeing the Amazing Spider-Man 2 (College. Finals. Fun times.), the inevitable happened. People talked about it and spoiled it for me. I heard words like ""intense,"" ""awesome,"" and ""so sad"". Oh, and ""Gwen dies."" Thanks. Words couldn't express how happy I was when one of the largest moments in Marvel movie history was ruined for me! (Sarcasm intended.) After a day of sulking, I still wanted to see the movie. In fact, knowing that she died, but not knowing how made me want to see it even more!<br/><br/>I don't care what other people say, I am a much bigger fan of the Amazing Spider-Man movies than the original trilogy. Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man > Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man. Garfield plays Peter Parker with a more natural feel. However, he's just a bit corny at times —""Alright, laundry sheriff."" The way in which Garfield portrays Spider- Man is extremely cocky, but hey, he backs it up. The only category that I feel Maguire was able to pull off better than Garfield was the dramatization. Screaming, crying, yelling, etc.—Maguire's performance was better, but that's not what Spider-Man should be about. In the original trilogy, I felt that the dramatic love triangle between Peter Parker, MJ, and Harry was the main story, and Spider-Man was the fourth wheel. On the other hand, with the much anticipated reboot, the story of Spider-Man was finally done right with Spider-Man actually being main focus of the movie.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was no exception. The action of this movie was much more intense than it was in the first Amazing Spider-Man. My only complaint was that I thought it was too rushed and congested with too many characters. (Three villains, really? Didn't Marc Webb take any notes after watching the embarrassment known as the third Spider-Man movie?) Rhino's character seemed a little unnecessary to me, however, I felt that his part in the end of the movie brought Peter Parker's need to be Spider-Man full circle. Before he went to fight Rhino, Spider-Man said, ""There really is no place like home."" I was impressed with Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon/Electro. I was amazed with how much the actor made me feel sorry for his character in the beginning and then how much I just wanted him to lose when he joined Harry. His motivation for being the villain was easy to understand. Stupid, but simple. He (just like a ton of other people) loved Spider-Man. Spider-Man saved him, temporarily forgot who he was, (Come on, Max was blue and completely unrecognizable so you got to give Spider-Man for even remembering who he was!) got mad, and then wanted to destroy Spider-Man and apparently the rest of the city. A slight overreaction. <br/><br/>I wish the writers would've elaborated on the friendship of Peter and Harry a little more. ""Hey, it's been a while. You got your braces off. I'm dying."" Clearly exaggerated, but that's what it felt like to me. Don't get me wrong, I loved Harry's character, but he was just too dark. Not in a bad way, but as I mentioned earlier, it just seemed like his motives and dark side were rushed into. On top of going a little crazy after finding out that he was dying, his excessive drinking probably had a little something to do with his break down. By far, I was most impressed with the character of Harry. His presence on screen was so unpredictable and mysterious that his scenes just radiated importance. Dane DeHaan's look as the Green Goblin was menacingly outstanding. Like most people, I was just a ""little"" enraged that he killed Gwen. (Luckily for people that only watch the Amazing Spider-Man to see Emma Stone, she is confirmed to still play a role in both the third and fourth installments of the series.)<br/><br/>Overall, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 was an intense and emotional red and blue roller-coaster ride. (Ha-ha I couldn't resist.) It constantly kept me on the edge of my seat. Some parts were just too much to handle. The camera work was done incredibly well, and the random shots of Spider-Man swinging through the city looked unbelievably realistic. It was a little fast-paced, but I think that was a much needed change from the first one. It was by far one of the most difficult superhero movies for me to sit through, and it was unlike anything I expected to see from a Spider-Man movie. I highly recommend it to any Spider-Man fan and even if you aren't a fan of the Amazing Spider-Man or just the character in general, watch this movie because it will most likely change your perception of the character. This movie can't come to Blu-ray fast enough."

","Being a huge fan of Spiderman, went to watch it First Day First Show and being among the first to be disappointed by the flick, there are lots of drawbacks that were making me feel ""wait... what ???"" and thus the film goes and the way this loosely bounded script can not be resulted in a better movie, coz seriously, the making of max as ""Electro"" is not as justified as the villains in previous Spiderman movies had, it all looks like a mess, the only thing that one can enjoy in the movie are some action sequences among the movie, beyond that, a few humorous jokes are good too, but you'll be disappointed if you look for a story in the movie. If you talk about the acting, the best one was Jamie Foxx as ""Electro"" , as he justifies the need of the character which was still misguided in the script, he should be pity and it makes you feel too, Emma stone as Gwen Stacy was good too, but yes Andrew Garfield, you disappointed a little bit.<br/><br/>If someone ask me for an Amazing Spiderman 3, I'll not be going with Mark Webb as a choice for that, we want our Great Sam Raimi back as the Spiderman maker...<br/><br/>In the end, it's better to wait for a DVD released version and watch at home unless you only want it to look for its special effects on big screen...."
"broo304802","8","11","27","17 July 2014"," All in all, great acting
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 wasn't what I was expecting. I expected Electro to be some bad A dude, not a nerdy fan-boy drooling over spider-man Then that Rhino with a man inside it came out at the end, i thought he would have showed up sooner because of the trailer. And don't get me started on the Harry kid. I thought Harry could of been introduced better into Peter's life somehow, the way they did it was probably because they didn't put him in the first movie. In the old Spiderman's Harry was there from the beginning, so i guess i'm a little confused why he wasn't in the new ones as early as the old. I did think that the acting was sensational, even remarkable. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie, not from all the action scenes, but by how well the actors portrayed their characters to such real levels. When Gwen died and Peter held her and cried, that felt surreal and gave me goosebumps. The scenes following her death you could see the sorrow and pain coming from Peter, which may i add, made me think of Twilight when Edward left Bella, and all she did was sit in her room and watch the seasons change through her window. oh my, i brought Twilight into this..."
"baragon94","9","11","27","19 June 2014"," Ignore the Critics; This is the Best Spidey Movie Yet.
","It would be an understatement to say that I was never a fan of the Raimi films. Whether it was the lazy kidnap Mary Jane plots, William Dafoe in a Power Rangers outfit, a miscast Tobey Maguire, or Kirsten Dunst turning everything into a superhero soap-opera, I failed to understand the universal acclaim surrounding Raimi's first two movies (we shall not speak of the atrocious Spider-Man 3) in which the source material was largely abandoned for a more conventional movie approach.<br/><br/>With Marc Webb's direction, we finally have a film that understands the essence of Spider-Man. Its predecessor in 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man was a fine effort, but with Peter now fully immersed in the role of Spider-Man, things get more interesting. There's plenty to love here, and fans of the comics will no doubt be pleased. The cast is outstanding; Andrew Garfield deserves an Oscar for ""Best Actor to Ever Portray a Superhero."" From his very first scene where he's knocking on the truck window of a Russian terrorist, the wisecracking nature of the Spidey we know and love from the comics is in full swing. Also returning from the previous film is Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, who once again provides dynamic chemistry with Garfield that is light years beyond Maguire/Dunst. The two of them shine on screen together and it's delightful to watch.<br/><br/>Electro is clearly the main villain in the film, but it is Dane DeHaan who really steals the show as Harry Osborne. Desperate to save his life, he believes Spider-Man's blood is his only salvation to his deteriorating condition. And this is what makes his portrayal so intriguing; he's essentially a tragic villain spawned by desperation and we sympathize with him. Though his Green Goblin is largely set up for the next film, he is infinitely more menacing than Dafoe's campy portrayal, and generates excitement for the future of the franchise. <br/><br/>Complaints of a bloated plot and an unfocused narrative have been common criticisms from film critics. This sequel picks up where the first movie left off on the origin story surrounding Peter's father, which is cool, how they've evolved the mystery of Peter's parents into an enticing back story. Meanwhile, we delve into Peter's trauma regarding the ghost of Gwen's father, his deteriorating relationships as a result of his responsibility in being Spider-Man, all while a slew of super- villains are served up by OsCorp (Well really only two). Sure, there is a lot going on, but some slight disorganization is certainly justified by the sheer level of ambition.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is everything I've ever wanted in a Spider-Man movie; it is the most faithful, thought invoking, and entertaining adaption to date of bringing the web-slinger to the big screen. The cast is phenomenal, the ambition is Dark Knight Rises caliber, and there's no shortage of heart; I was reduced to tears twice. Ignore the critics; this one is for the fans. And let's face it, we deserve it."
"alandevro62","8","10","24","28 June 2014"," Better than people say
","This movie is getting a lot of bad reviews everywhere and I have to say I actually enjoyed the amazing spider-man 2! I thought it was a great movie. The villains were handled perfectly. I have to admit when I heard that Harry Osborn was going to be the green goblin I was a little worried but they pulled off the villain perfectly. When they killed Gwen off it might not have been the same way they did it in the comics but it was still done well the way they slowed down the scene really just added the tension and when she died they made it such a sad death that it made it a highlight. But it may have had sad parts but it had some funny scenes. People need to not see this movie as the best movie ever the need to see it as the first movie in a larger act. With the sinister six in the next movie they stakes are high but I think they will pull it off. So please don't let this movie ruin your view if you don't like it just go to see the next one because trust me it will be worth it."

It's action packed, it's a tear jerker, it has comedic moments that give the film a more light hearted feel, it's got a great cast and awesome special effects. I fail to see why it received such poor reviews. Stone and Garfield's chemistry is spot on, all performances are (more than) believable. Altogether it was a great film. It is much better than its predecessor and certainly outdoes the original spider man series. The performances in this film were so brilliant that I was able to ride on the emotional roller coaster that the film provides us with. I laughed, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat, I gawked at the adorable moments between Garfield and Stone. This is perhaps the most underrated film of the year so far.

"bigwan","9","10","24","26 May 2014"," The Amazing Spiderman 2 was an enjoyable action film
","So far the best movie in the Spider-Man series to me has been Spider-man 2(the one with Doc Ock). I felt the reboot done a couple years ago left too many things open, but I was very hopeful for the sequel. Boy does it deliver, and has passed every single other Spider-Man on my list. This, to me(for now), is my favorite movie in the entire Spider-Man line of movies. It has amazing action, great acting, and it has some balls that a lot of superhero movies don't have. I was very leary going in that it would be like Spider-Man 3 with the Sandman and Venom, where it would have too much going on with the different villains. But even with the Green Goblin, Electro, and Rhino, this movie is not overstuffed. It all works and all makes sense. I really like where the story goes and where it's heading. Andrew Garfield to me, IS Spider-Man now. His chemistry with Emma Stone is fantastic. Jamie Foxx was great as Electro, BUT, it felt way too cartoony. Reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson when he turned into the Joker in the original Batman movie. Dane Dehaan is one of my favorite young actors and is a great pick to play the Goblin. He reeks of rich and evil, and does it perfectly. The movie has some flaws, but overall this is a very entertaining and continues the story perfectly. Great way to start the Summer movie season. The future of the franchise is VERY bright.<br/><br/>Watching The Amazing Spiderman 2 Full movie online visit http://gg.gg/amazing2"
"rahuljonathan-nair","9","10","24","25 May 2014"," Nice sequel!
","What sets Marc Webb's iteration of the web-slinger's story apart from Spider-Man's previous cinematic outings (and indeed, other superhero films) is that along with its share of action, epic fights and special effects, there is a vibrant, emotional core at the heart of this movie. The action sequences are breathtaking and despite the running time, the film doesn't drag. Garfield and Stone, in the scenes where they are together, have a palpable chemistry. This Spider-Man serves up both pathos and power. The performances, story-line and pacing of the film are great, but what really sets it apart is the direction, choreography of the action sequences and the next level visual effects. The film is a well written, true to the comics, adaptation of one of one of Marvel's on the ground soldiers. Fans of the first movie, and superhero movies in general should definitely go for this one. PS: There's an ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" scene at the end of the movie you wouldn't want to miss."

","First of all, this is not ""amazing"". Not even close! Where was the action again? I thought I was going to watch an action movie. Turned out to be a horribly annoying romantic crap. Annoying emotion, hope-talk, crying took up more time than the action part. And even the action part was crappy. It's like 2 minutes of fight with the villains and Spiderman always wins within 2 minutes without much damage. They should have called it a fairly tale or something! I'll feel sorry for the 2 hours I wasted here for 2 years at least. I feel sorry for whoever spent money on this crap. Worst Spiderman movie ever on the face of this entire universe!!!"
"jtakhirov","7","22","63","2 May 2014"," The BEST Spider-Man so far
","After re-watching this film, I have lowered my rating from 10 to 7. I believe I was caught up in the hype and now that I have rewatched, its not that great lol. My original review below. <br/><br/>I watched the movie in 3D on opening night. I was not sure what to expect as some of the critic reviews I had read were not so flattering. However, within the first 10 minutes of the movie I was hooked.<br/><br/>Visually, this is the most realistic and fluid Spider-Man film yet. All of the movements and actions are exactly as if you would imagine if you ever read any of the comics or watched the CLASSIC Spider-Man cartoon in the 90's. <br/><br/>I was especially glad that the web swinging was realistically designed, as you were shown which buildings the web is sticking to and how it affects Spider-Mans trajectory as he swings through the air.<br/><br/>The Acting was top notch. I think Andrew Garfield is the best version of Peter Parker we will ever see. He is a perfect fit for the character and his chemistry with Emma Stone is amazing. The only character that really annoyed me was Norman Osborn. He was, how can I best put it, a Wanksta!<br/><br/>The Story was more about Spidey and Gwen Stacy, rather than the villains. I understand that this may have not appealed to some fans. However, this is exactly what Spider-Man is about. Spider-Man is about a regular guy with regular guy problems, which cause him just about as much pain as his work as a superhero. <br/><br/>In fact, Spider-Man is more comfortable with fighting super villains on a daily basis than dealing with his past and relationships. Unlike other superheros, what makes Spider-Man so unique is that he is a regular guy who nobody knows about. <br/><br/>He ,akes ends meat as a photographer, lives at home with his aunt and has to support her, has a complicated relationship with his friends/girlfriend and has to juggle all this while fighting crime on a daily basis. Spider-Man provides a unique experience from both the view of a civilian as well as a hero."

","Wow. I was really disappointed. <br/><br/>I feel like this movie was a total mess, too many random stories in the mix for one movie. It had a lot missing unexplained parts. Rhino was a waste of time, I hated the trailers were such a false advertisement. No Wonder Emma decide to quit after this movie.<br/><br/>The villain are joke especially you feel like you are watching over whelmed electro thats a whiny loser and the character development was rushed. It's poor writing, and choppy at times. Irrelevant parts was not needed in this movie.<br/><br/>It should have be written and executed characters better. <br/><br/>It was just sad and a major let down and nowhere near an awesome epic movie like Captain America 2."

","Well what can I say about this film. As well as my babe(Andrew Garfield - mmmmm as SPidey) I was most impressed with the film. It was literally Electrifiying and epic. We were treated to non-stop action of villains. WE had a mad man at the beginning. Can't recall his name. Then along came Electro(Foxxx) woah what a performance. I was most impressed with it. Every time he spoke it was heaven to listen to. So soothing as i said in my previous review of: The Legend of Hercules. At the beginning of the film, it was shown that he was a ""Nobody"" in that nobody cared if he existed. Spidey assured him: That ""He's NOT a nobody, he's a somebody"". He even took issue with SPidey. hehehe. So then came another villain Harry Osborne((DeHanan)Son of the founder of Oscorp- if I'm to be correct. Correct me if I'm wrong). Harry wanted to get blood from Spiderman(My babe - Garfield. mmmm) as his father passed on a hereditary to him, that was killing him. So as Spidey wouldn't do it, he had to resort to other ways. So Electro and himself formed a team, to fight against him. Electro V Spidey fantastic. Anywhere ELectro was was most admirable. I truly enjoyed this film in total. Although it is with great sadness that Marvel killed off the main character(Gwen i'm referring to), that was most upsetting. Considering Spidey kept seeing visions of her dead father.<br/><br/>I even suggested that it was better than Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I found this particular film to have great action don't get me wrong, but the dialogue, a bit of a yawn. Whereas SPidey, yep plenny of it. No doubt. As with any film, this particular film was no different when it came to comedy. Truly amazing, esp with my hunky. heheeh The film portrayed our severe reliance on Electricity. LIke the Airprots Radar was gone. Not even the telelphone wouldn't work. Overall highly recommended film. Totally awesome. Go and see it."

These are great events. realistic and completely to lock the screen, the audience, in a Word, this works amazing succeeding the film's Director, Marc Webb, is the biggest factor in providing us with the film writers Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci. the principal of great players with screens (I'm sure this works without them, it wouldn't be as nice.) Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamiee Foxx, Done DeHann, Sally Field. Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, how much regret with each other if they were separated from each other so even if they are angry in their love, and it was possible to feel the love from the screen that they are against each other. Anson Parker and new enemies, giving this film the fights between the winded color of course was one of the most important scenes.

"zurnd","10","13","34","26 April 2014"," Blows The First Film Out of the Water. This is the Spider-Man I've Been Waiting For
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been a subject of much controversy since it was first announced, which was even before the first film hit theater screens. There have been many of the same arguments given by people, saying that the series didn't need a revamp and that it will never live up to the epic proportion of the Sam Raimi films. But it's all a matter of opinion, and while I deeply loved the first Marc Webb directed reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a superior film, a Spidey flick I've long dreamed to see. Spider-Man is my favorite costumed hero, I know this, everyone who knows me knows this and to me, this is the film that displays the red and blue web head in all his glory. While I still consider Spider-Man 2 one of my all time favorite superhero flicks, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 might very well top it, in many ways than one. <br/><br/>I finally got to see my favorite superhero act the way he did in the comics. Seeing the wisecracking, sarcastic side of Spidey brought a smile to my lips and while the Raimi films had a touch of it, this film really showcased Spidey for the silly schmuck he is. He's very reminiscent of Josh Keaton, who voiced Spidey on the Spectacular Spider-Man cartoon. Andrew Garfield has that perfect balance of humor, seriousness and determination, making Peter Parker more than just a vigilante crime fighter. He's very much like a realistic young adult. I also like the suit. While the first film's suit was more stylized and unique among Spidey's wardrobe, this one looks as if it was taken right off the comic book pages, minus the elongated spider logo and shiny black webbing.<br/><br/>Electro is my favorite among Spidey's rogues gallery and Jamie Foxx played Max Dillon as not only an electroshocking Mr. Freeze lookalike that likes to shoot lightning from his hands, but a sympathetic and relatable so called ""nobody"". He starts off as an admirer of Spider-Man, but as the film progresses and he gets a dosage of electric eel juice, he comes to despise the wall crawler, feeling that he is stealing his thunder (pun intended). There's also the Rhino, portrayed by Paul Giamatti. He's very different than the character portrayed in the mainstream comics and the various animated series, but Giamatti plays the Russian mobster turned pachyderm like the ham ball he is. Then there is Harry Osborn, portrayed by Dane DeHaan. And let's face it, the cat's out of the bag. If you have seen the trailers, you know he becomes the cackling, glider riding Green Goblin. Yes, DeHaan portrays a maniacal and in many ways grotesque goblin, but the buildup to his goblin transformation is really something to see. Harry Osborn is played out to be the misunderstood son of a rich man, who can be relatable in some scenes and teeth grindingly evil in others. We'll see if he'll don the green glider again in upcoming sequels, or if his daddio, Norman Osborn comes back from the dead to do the job. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is probably the film's best element. It was evident in the first installment and it glimmers here. I love the way the two actors work off each other and act like a contemporary couple. You can really tell that Peter and Gwen are madly in love with each other. Now if only Peter didn't make that promise to Gwen's dying father to keep her out of his Spider-Man duties. Now I'm not going to reveal anything, nor deny that a certain main character meets his or her end by the film's conclusion. You'll just have to see the flick for yourself. If your a Spider-Man fan, this might quench your thirst for a good Spider-Man adventure. Sure, some will not go gaga over this sequel or it's predecessor, but for me, it's one of the best superhero flicks I've seen in a while. Better than Man of Steel, better than Spider-Man 3, better than The Wolverine. It's simply fantastic and like the first film, it's a treat. Just go in with an open mind. You'll never know what to expect. <br/><br/>I just can't wait to see what Webb and co have in store next. It looks to be the beginning of a much bigger, broader Spider-Man movie universe."
"aharmas","3","19","54","4 May 2014"," Perfect Wreck
","I was ready to give five out of ten stars, and then these people couldn't have done worse!!! There goes one of the reasons one goes to see these movie, and let me tell you: It's not any of the scatterbrained villains they came up with this time. I haven't seen a sorriest trio. There is not an ounce of personality, an attempt to give anyone of them any qualities worth mentioning. It's all flash, aimless technology, the fanciest of elements all thrown together, with no sense of intelligence or direction.<br/><br/>Parker is back, perky as ever in his alter ego, enjoying every minute of his job as the webbed superhero. His personal life is running into several problems, as he thinks Gwen shouldn't be exposed to anymore of his adventures. His guilt is too much of a burden, and in addition to that, there are family problems by way of his scientist father.<br/><br/>This film makes mistake after mistake by not focusing on what's important, not understanding the genre and its evolution. Just recently, ""Captain America"" and ""Thor"" have produced sequels which hold on to some of their best elements and engage with more complex themes. We're not expecting ""All The President's Men"" here, but we want to be entertained because the villains are scary, powerful and worthy challengers. What we get is a half baked bunch of ideas which appear to fizzle before their plot resolutions, and in a desperate attempt to pump some life into the DOA film, a character is sacrificed, and the choice couldn't be worse. Oh yes, it's the most intense moment of the film, and it breaks our hearts because it's about the only thing in the movie that has any resonance. I remember when Spock loses his mother and almost loses Kirk in the latest reincarnations of ""Star Trek"". The moments are memorable, and the films never stop dazzling in their takes of the genre. Here, we almost wish the film became quieter, and we would have Romeo and Juliet instead. Sadly, we're left with a bunch of empty tin cans, and three villains that have neither enough inside or outside. They don't look or act like anything that will be remembered.<br/><br/>There's some snappy editing, and Spidey still glides, jumps, and summer saults with plenty of class throughout Manhattan. His chemistry in and out of his suit is amazing with his real life partner. One of the greatest moments in the movie has him delivering a message to her, and watching them have a little ""domestic"" dispute before he goes to defend us poor mortals, we can see this is the perfect team: She's the brains, he's the muscle. And the scatterbrained team behind this film goes and destroys this amazing team.<br/><br/>There's an inspirational moment as Spidey recovers his will to fight and protect, but once again, the film crashes and severely burns with one of the worst endings in movie history, a stupid and pathetic one if there ever was one. We have seen revengeful dragons, backstabbing gods, and the impending doom of science gone awry in in recent months. The end of this film is begging Hollywood to kill this franchise because like Spidey, we might not have reason to live anymore.<br/><br/>R.I.P."

"liamfryer","10","12","31","17 April 2014"," The best yet !
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is truly a masterpiece of a movie in an era where it is so competitive in creating a good superhero movie... The Amazing Spider-man 2 blows them all away with ease. <br/><br/>Very few films, actors and stories get you completely engrossed to the point where you feel as though you live in their world, but Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and the rest of the cast do it perfectly. <br/><br/>Sam Riami's Predeceasing films were good but this Spidey is 'Amazing' and it is not for what you might think. Yes the cgi and special effects are better simply for the development of technology over time. However, It is how close knit to the original Spidey these films are keeping which is so impressive. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfields portrayal is exceptional, he has completely made the role his own, some when I speak of Spider-man will now say, 'Toby Who?' His general look in the costume is much more realistic and his humour is beyond question, brilliant. He really is 'just a normal guy' as he claimed his the first instalment saving a kid from a dangling car inferno.<br/><br/>The Plot is twisting and turning throughout with something always going on and when there is a non-action period, the story is so enthralling we don't even notice. <br/><br/>With emotion, love, Undeynably excellent action sequences, Depth, and Character to both Amazing Spider-man films to date, a Spidey world has been created that I never want to leave. <br/><br/>They have a chance here to do something really special, not just 3 films say, but more like a series of 7 or 8 or 9 films (Im thinking Star Wars, Harry Potter Style) and confidently stick with Garfield. Let his character of Spiderman grow as he does over a period of years to come. It could become arguably one of the greatest film sets of all time from one of the most famous and iconic fictional figures of all time. <br/><br/>To sum up all iv'e said:<br/><br/>Sheer Brilliance."

I loved how well they did on this spider-man the action parts were intense even the drama stuff wasn't all annoying. I have to say though i did not like how Gwen died it kind of made you not want spider-man to be spider-man anymore. I mean everyone loved Emma stone as Gwen why did they have to kill her off? what i loved the most though is that they kept spider-man like the classics. The newspapers hate him, but he is still making those fun jokes that makes the movie fun to watch. so i have to say it was a great show and i would recommend you go see it."
"evertonfangames","8","11","28","19 April 2014"," My favourite Spiderman yet with more to come!
","I'm just going to start off by saying I was never a fan of Raimi's films (please no hate) but my personal preference is the more Dark Knight style. The main reason as to why this is my favourite is because it's far from your cheesy superhero movie. So I never found (Raimi's) Spiderman 2 that much of a challenge to beat. However I get why people call this a movie part of a franchise rather than a stand alone blockbuster. I'll go through this by each category and no major spoilers are given away only stuff we know from the trailers.<br/><br/>Plot: I'll start of by saying I really like the way TASM endeavours into Richard Parker and to why Peter is orphaned. The way Richard ties into the movie is quite clever and without giving too much away, we see him give an explanation as to how Peter could become Spiderman and how Harry could become the Green Goblin. I also like the way Harry was introduced and to how he came to hate Spiderman. The movie has been criticised for trying to do too much and I felt although Peter's inner conflict over Gwen is necessary, getting her to go to England was a bit much. It is a totally realistic situation (well for a superhero movie) but it felt too much seeing Peter jump from trying to help Harry, to discovering about his father and then to Gwen who's going to England. It felt a bit disjointed with the transitions between all of the dramas.<br/><br/>Main Characters: Spiderman: Did a great job of portraying wise-cracking Spiderman without going over the top and being a total dick. His fighting was pretty badass too. After TASM 1 the general consensus was that Garfield was a better Peter and Maguire was a better Spiderman. Of course Maguire fans will still say Tobey was better but I reckon the majority will call Garfield the better Spiderman after this one. <br/><br/>Peter:I loved Garfield's non cry-baby version of Peter TASM1 and he backed it up with another great performance here! There was a great bit of acting between him and Aunt May when talking about Richard.<br/><br/>Gwen: I'm trying to avoid bagging out Raimi's films but its fair to say Emma Stone is far better than Kirsten Dunst. Gwen gives a powerful non naggyperformance. In Spiderman 2 MJ and Gwen have a similar problem, Petercan't date them because of personal reasons. The main difference is that Gwen isn't a naggy female dog! Yes Gwen knows that he's Spiderman but she doesn't make it all about herself. OK enough comparison to Raimi's films, Stone does amazing and has great chemistry with Garfield and she does what she can to make herself of use and help Spidey.<br/><br/>Electro: A solid performance from Foxx but not show stealing. Max Dillon came across as very creepy (intentionally) and credit to Foxx he still made us feel sympathetic to him. He was a badass villain for sure who thrived on attention but wasn't given enough screen time! <br/><br/>Harry(Green Goblin): One more Raimi comparison. The first time I watched the originals I really liked Franco as Harry, the second time I felt he was cheesy and over acted. DeHaan was fantastic as Harry! I even felt sympathetic towards him but as the Green Goblin wasn't given enough screen time as well. DeHaan was a superior Osborn in my opinion but his appearance as the Goblin wasn't lengthy or memorable enough to overshadow Dafoe's version. <br/><br/>Action: The action in this movie is brilliant! The fight scenes are my favourite from any Spiderman but there wasn't enough! The middle of the movie was deep, focusing on the conflicts of Peter but it is still a superhero movie, we want action. The way the movie went they could have made a real badass classic Spiderman vs Goblin fight but other reasons did prevent it. I hope in the Sinister Six they focus less on Peter and more on fighting! The first fight scene with Electro was awesome and I loved the spidey sense slow mo!<br/><br/>Soundtrack: I love Hans Zimmer and his soundtracks and he did not disappoint in this one! Him and Pharrell Williams made a really intense atmosphere when Spidey and Electro met for the first time! However, I thought they blew a huge opportunity when Electro rose from his Darth Vader style bed. They could have made a really intimidating atmosphere like Star Wars does with Vader but they went for a comical soundtrack instead which really didn't appeal to me<br/><br/>Conclusion: A great film but its more of a setup for bigger things to come! I can't wait for a Sinister Six film and also Venom! My fave Spidey yet but there is room for improvement!"
"shreya-mitra077","8","10","25","7 June 2014"," As the second installment of the Spiderman franchise arrives, Peter Parker has to balance between his two lives, battling villains and fighting for his love.
","""We have to be greater than what we suffer. My wish for you, is to become hope. People need that.""<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 reestablishes that hope no matter how impossible it seems, is never really false and that a little faith is all we need to get through times most critical...<br/><br/>We are not quite over that time, when the mention of Superhero flicks was synonymous to 'action-packed', 'adrenaline-rushing' cinematic effort where people can just sink in a couple of hours of unimaginable extravaganza and leave the theater without being too intensely involved in what they just experienced. However, the scene has undergone a considerable transformation in the recent past. Now it's the human content veiled under the dazzle of special effects that appeal straight to the heart and numb our senses for a while. The second installment of The Amazing Spider-Man series, from director Marc Webb (what a wordplay!), arrives exactly in the premise where a hero's emotive involvement counts more than his impregnable valor.<br/><br/>I will start with grumbling that this movie has been way too over- reviewed and that too, extremely rigorously. It has been weighed on scales that don't even fit its delineation. If you feel like it's worth a watch, just go for it already. Do not let too many skeptic reviewers spoil the broth for you.<br/><br/>Screenplay: Screenplay is definitely not a strong footing for this film, but judicious use of poignant screen elements and arresting dialogues anchors the 142 mins show till the very end and never does it seem that the narrative meddles with the action content or vice-versa.<br/><br/>Casting: This review won't even hold a worth equivalent to a penny, if I do not talk about the man who takes the lead in weaving the cobweb of ""ALL THINGS AMAZING"" and illuminates the screen with his presence. Andrew Garfield yet again electrifies with his avant-garde blend of quick humor, innocence and youthful charm. However what's greater is how he effortlessly gets into the skin of Peter Parker and portrays his normalcy, his geekery, his desires and qualms in one go. After all, we may love the superhero, but the common man in the crowd is the one we identify our self with, ain't that so?! Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is brilliant and as vibrant as the spring. She is an outstanding exception from the rest of the stereotyped ladies in a superhero flick who always get a narrow delineation, get abducted by the villain, screams for the hero to show up and well, get saved. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan are decent in their own limited screen space. But what steals the cookie away is the ship between Peter and Gwen which manages to radiate their vibes so adorably well.<br/><br/>Music: When there's Hans Zimmer, awesomeness comes with a guarantee card. This film, though quite contrary to its genre, showcases some breathtaking Original Sound Tracks (OSTs) and equally well used featured tracks. Tell me if you don't get goose bumped when ""Gone Gone Gone"" by Phillip Philips plays. :"")<br/><br/>VFX: the VFX is impeccably executed though it keeps you craving for more. The film definitely has some of the best uses of CGI among its contemporaries.<br/><br/>Some of the inadequacies that peril the film are a lack of good non- linear narrative, overload of villains, and deficient subplots. The film never hints a drag but many anecdotes are left slightly under-explained.<br/><br/>However, the film comprises of loads of reasons to cheer for that clearly rub away the other tarnishes. A fresh casting, moving lines, and the inseparable embodiment of the emotive element gets the magic wand working. I accept the film with all its splendors and its flaws. :"") <br/><br/>After all that emotional and dramatic roller-coaster ride, you will feel your eyes are moist and that unknowingly you are falling for that cliché again, ""The Good always Triumph... But not without paying a price.""<br/><br/>May be there will be no masked Messiah arriving for us, but we can always hope for the same right and believe that even in an end, there is a hope for a new beginning. As Gwen Stacy would put it, ""What makes life valuable is that it doesn't last forever. What makes it precious is that it ends."""

At first, the movie seemed to progress too fast, but in the end I enjoyed this aspect because it made the film constantly exciting. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone do a very good job acting in general and portraying the love interest. Although there are a few bumps in their relationship, it is not overly dramatic like Maguire/Dunst in Spider-mans 1, 2 and 3, which was a relief.<br/><br/>People complain that there were too many villains, but this was not a problem at all. This film did well incorporating and introducing both villains and their action with Spider-man.<br/><br/>The only thing that disappointed me was the action--in reviews I had read that there was a lot and that it was well-done. The special effects were very well done, but the action between Spider-man and the main villains was limited. Additionally, the action between Spider-man and his villains still was not up to par with that of Spider-man 2 with Doc Ock. Although the action was not what I was expecting, it was still a great part of the film and very enjoyable. <br/><br/>Also, although Jamie Foxx did a good job in this film, using him seemed unnecessary, especially because he is the sparkling-blue Electro for most of the film, you can hardly tell that it is Jamie Foxx, and he doesn't talk much while he is Electro. However, Foxx did a good job and contributed to the film.<br/><br/>In closing, I highly recommend this film. It is clearly the best Spider-man film until now and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. It was very interesting, engaging, and exciting. You won't be disappointed."

","I enjoyed 'The Amazing Spider-Man"". It was effective particularly given it was a reboot, not too long after the Rami-MacGuire Movies. Andrew Garfield did well, but one complaint many had was he was very introverted, and it lacked a lot of the classic humor from the character in the Comics. Not So in The Amazing Spider-Man 2! <br/><br/>Garfield's Spider-man is much more humorous and outgoing in this one! Garfield and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey) continue their great chemistry from the 1st one, and Sally Field (Aunt May) also returning is great again. Dan DeHann's Harry Osborne is a true highlight. Jamie Foxx does well as ""Electro"". It should be noted not too much is given on his character's background, but it does little too diminish the movie. Tone Wise, The First ""Amazing Spider-Man"" is much better, and much more consistent. The changes in tone, is a fair criticism of the movie, as at times possibly the movie may be too fast paced, but in the end - It was Fun! 3 out of 4 Stars!"
"raulgzayas","8","9","22","20 April 2014"," YES... it is better than the first one....
","Just back from the theater after watching Spider Man 2... in 2D ( sorry... not a big 3D fan) I am not a superhero/comic fan, so my review is based on my personal opinion on my expectations for this type of film... an entertaining experience, and I am happy to say, this one delivers! Not only the action sequences were great, I do think even the screenplay, the acting and even how the story evolves thru the film is way superior than it's predecessor.<br/><br/>Jaime Foxx is superb on his role, and as it usually happens when you finished watching a good action film... you probably will ask for a little more, but what you just watched was good enough anyway! <br/><br/>Just as the Batman/Dark Knight reboot, this new delivery of Spidey is a Little more ""dark"" than the previous one from Sam Raimi, not only because on this new series, we learn something about Peter Parker childhood ( re:their parents), but because as Uncle Ben said once, Mr Parker starts to really ponder that with great power comes great responsibility, and that a superhero lifestyle is not always so nice... (ask Tony Stark-IM3)<br/><br/>If I have to compare SM2 vs. Captain America- Winter Soldier, the good 'ol Captain might win the battle for half a point, but Spidey will have people smiling at the end of the movie... and just as Batman, it would be nice if a third and final installment can be already in the works to close this latest update ""refresh"" on our friendly neighbor... The Amazing Spider Man!"
"anthonywlafemina","10","18","52","13 May 2014"," Very Amazing
","Short and sweet...it delivers. It's better than the first one...which I boycotted for a while, due to my loyalty to Sam Raimi for (as another correct user stated) ""revitalizing the comic book movie."" Eventually I gave it a chance and I loved The Amazing Spiderman. Well this sequel was just incredible. I don't know how they did it...all the moving parts just, worked. I fell in love with Gwen Stacey. I hurt for Peter Parker. I hurt more for Peter's father. I marveled at Electro...Jamie Foxx was just incredible...even his voice was electric. The Osborns were well played out. Please ignore the naysayers...the ""intellectuals."" This was a great movie. I felt like I was there. This was my favorite movie ever. Thanks Marc Webb."
"elvijs-krumins","6","8","19","1 May 2014"," Less than amazing
","Saw the movie about half a week ago. And it hurts me to say, this one suffers from the same problems as Spider man 3 did. Although, some things improved, I was annoyed at the way the villains were handled. We know from the trailers, there's 3 of them (while in fact only 2 actually had some screen time). And yet, it would have been so much better with only one villain. Electro's reasons for terrorizing the city were stupid and childish, the Green Goblin was incredibly cool, and yet he wasn't the focus of the movie, so there was not nearly enough of him. None of the mentioned characters received the attention they deserved in fact, their screen time, story was very lacking due to time limitations. This was, however, the director's decision and it served the movie and the fans in all the wrong ways. The action was cool however, the visuals were stunning. I can say nothing bad about that. <br/><br/>And yet the structure of the movie itself was kinda of a mess too. The scenes of life of Peter and Spider-man were constantly interrupting each other. Ultimately it didn't feel like a properly powerful story anymore, just a collection of dialog and action scenes that lead to nothing. This jumping back and forth could have been replaced with more character development for the villains. <br/><br/>I am sincerely hoping this movie receives enough criticism for the director to take notice and make improvements in the next installment.<br/><br/>For a spider-man fan, there's still plenty to see and enjoy (just for the sake of seeing the beloved wall-crawler on the big screen again). The regular movie lovers, however, should not get their expectations too high. <br/><br/>Through the interviews it seemed that Mark Webb had taken into account and learned from the problems Spider man 3 had. Well.. I would like to respectfully disagree."
"rigoletto339","Null","7","16","17 May 2014"," Left me cold
","There's something about this one that left me cold - uninvolved.<br/><br/>But first: if you haven't seen it yet, stay through the final credits - all of them. There's a trailer that's really a preview of a new X-Men movie.<br/><br/>This time around, Stan Lee is easy to spot. He even gets a speaking line. I wonder if they paid him scale......<br/><br/>After a few giant monster movies, the genre gets old. I saw nothing new and interesting about this movie's monsters. Big, nasty, powerful - yawn, been there, done that. <br/><br/>There's an interesting contrast between Parker/Spiderman and Wayne/Batman: Batman comes from a wealthy family (and has Michael Caine as a Number Two), lives in a mansion; Parker and his aunt are barely getting by, live in an apartment.<br/><br/>The spider-silk acrobatics are too far out to be believable. Each journey through the city (always conducted at altitude) takes at least 23 times his own body weight in silk thread.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the special effects are great. Downtown New York has been destroyed in so many movies, it's a wonder anybody stays there.<br/><br/>The local theater where we saw it dropped the 3D version early. I asked the manager about that; he said hardly anybody went to that one. I wonder of the thrill of 3D is wearing off.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I'd go for the special effects, not the story."

","after a quite good reboot of the spider-man franchise (TASM1), we can say this is the best spidey movie in the view of visual effects and background score. Rise of electro (jamie Fox) most anticipated villain in spider-man comics is the gud kick start for the franchise, may be he can be used more than this because of his incredible powers, Marc Webb directed the film very brilliantly every shot & scene is well taken especially the scene at times square is quite too awesomeness, and coming to script and screen play Andrew & Emma chemistry went well all the way in the film, harry Osborn character is very well crafted, background score by Hans zimmer is too good in the fight scenes according to the act ,the beats of music is very nice to listen. the emotional scenes at the ending is good. finally Its very worth to watch film & spidey lovers going to love this one very well !"
"chris_158","5","7","16","18 April 2014"," Entertaining RIde!
","'The amazing spider man 2' presents itself as a a very entertaining popcorn movie with the likes of Andrew Garfield at the helm of the character Spider-man, in which he is perfectly suited. He delivers again the second time around as a relatable teenager who is just graduating from high school and is having problems with his love interest Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone as he is concerned for her safety. As the film opens we see that he is back to his usual of fighting crime, and the city itself have accepted spider-man as a hero . Peter Parker has a lot on his plate in this one as he discovers the mystery behind his parents abrupt disappearance from his life as a young boy where he delves further into the truth. He is also challenged by the antagonist Electro played by Jamie fox as a man who seeks to be noticed by others. Among the new characters is also Harry Osborne Peter Parkers childhood friend from the past who has come back to New York city where he learns a terrible truth about Oscorp and the Osborne family curse, as he tries to seeks out spider-mans help. <br/><br/>As a whole this is a very enjoyable film that has many flaws but are excused by the very well done action scenes that have very impressive CGI, especially the New York central scene with Electro. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is well done as that is director Mark Webbs strongest points to making a movie that involve the relationships between the key characters. The acting is fine by the main actors which also includes the likes of sally field who plays Peters Aunt may and newcomer to the series Jamie Foxx is okay too as Electro.<br/><br/>The gripes that I have about the film is that it is all a bit clustered, with too much going on, which brought me back to the terrible spider man 3 but definitely no where near that bad. I think that Harry Osborn could have been fleshed out more as a character and also cast more appropriately. Electro was an exceptional villain from the film as we see the problems he suffers through in life. <br/><br/>Overall many fans of the series and genre and genre will enjoy this experience. The film has great acting and the movie is worth it for the entertainment value with awesome CGI, but the movie strives to hard to be bigger than it should be, and expands too much as the film runs overlong by the two hour mark. Mark Webb did an excellent job putting this film together but their is much too that can be improved on for 'The Amazing Spiderman 3' which I'm sure will be very successful as well as this film when it opens world wide. <br/><br/>Solid 7/10"
"rolsdraiv","7","3","5","26 June 2019"," Disappointing ending...good movie after all.
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun and the love releationship between Peter and Gwen was so good but the ending was so disappointing that make me feel the whole movie pointless. It felt like totally waste of time. I understand that Gwen Stacy's death is important part of Spider-Man's comic history... but this moment in this movie just ruined the movie. At the end Peter end up alone continuing doing Spider-Man stuff even that was his fault the deaths of Gwen, her father, Harry and Doctor Connor(I don't remember if Elector died too). He didn't learn any responsibility at all and if he did ... good it costed the life's of so much people. I give the movie 7/10 because the ending."
"supersilvertoon","1","3","5","6 May 2018"," Why do people think this movie is good
","Can we bring Tobey Maguire back please. I love Andrew Garfield and all but as Spiderman he lacks any real emotion as being the Spiderman character he is supposed to fill. Spiderman is a teenager still in high school and Garfield looks like a grown 25 year-old man. The motivation and reasoning for the blue electro ""no-one-cares-about-him"" villain portrayed by Jamie Fox is completely abysmally stupid. ""Spiderman doesn't remember me from that one random time I said hi to him and even though I LOOK NOTHING LIKE I DID BEFORE he should remember me"". Shut up. This villain character sucks and is forgettable in every way possible. 
I'm glad Gwen died in this movie honestly. It's a perfect representation of this catastrophe that was ""The 'Amazing' Spider-Man"" franchise. 
Was it enjoyable? 
not really as the SGI for Jamie's character made it look like he had an extra 20 chromosomes and was not believable whatsoever. Even at the age of 13 I didn't understand why electro dude hated Spider-Man so much. It made no sense.
You ruined my favorite superhero and I will hate you forever for it. Waste of money and time, but it is the perfect example of what NOT to do in a movie.

He is trying to show off that he is spider- man every chance he had.. In part 1 he is taking off his mask very often showing his face and showing off his new skills to people.. Now wooing Gwen like a spoiled kid in his spidey suit trying to make her stay when she is leaving? And spinning a huge web saying I Love You telling the whole world.. W T F? If he is wooing Gwen as Peter Parker, that is still acceptable.. Wooing Gwen in spider-man suit makes him look like a skirt chasing whim who tries to impress girls with his spider-man identity.. Totally spoils the image of spider-man.. Just watch the Spider Man 1-3 by Tobey Maguire.. At least he brings out the spider-man with discipline and of some sense..

","I'm going to cut to the chase, I didn't care for Amazing Spider-man and didn't understand how so many gave it 7 out of 10 stars and yet felt the movie was a let down!! Now I'm seeing the same pattern with this sequel and it makes you wonder whether the whole rating system should be abandon until a movie has been in the theaters for at least 2-3 months. With that being said, Sony made several mistakes with this reboot and frankly, Andrew Garfield isn't a convincing Peter Parker/Spider-man. <br/><br/>This movie is focusing too much on introducing the much rumored ""Sinister Six"" movie and less on the character development. We didn't need to be re-introduced to Spider-man and as long as Sony stays on this course, we're going to continue to get bad spidey movies. Marvel should have taken the reigns but that's not possible anytime soon because of rights owned by Sony. Webb is a terrible director or at least for this franchise and admits to many mistakes from the first film and admits trying to make up for those mistakes in this sequel. Get another director (maybe Raimi again) and recast or suffer another box office flop!"
"statuskuo","9","11","29","19 May 2014"," Not A Comic Book Guy
","I went into this movie not a comic book person. I think it may've been helpful in just letting the story be absorbed. There's something about Marc Webb's storytelling that really hits the adolescent side of me. All the good parts of it. The first love. The lost love. He just is very tuned into the pain of that loss and the ability to move forward. That's how I felt about AMS2. This was an gentle rendition of this series that added a lot more character development in a storyline that is all too familiar. I really enjoyed that Garfield's Peter Parker is an authentic teen. He is trapped in a vortex of whether or not his desire in life can outweigh his responsibility. Something that echoes, without being overbearing, in the voice of his dead uncle. You get that he is a very haunted person.<br/><br/>I feel, for the most part, this isn't really a comic book movie. It's got comic book characters. But it seems to be more a great drama. Very well done and a nice puzzle piece to the new rebooted series. Can't wait to see what's next."
"musiconnections","3","16","46","29 April 2014"," A big let down to the Spiderman franchise.
","Much as I enjoyed Spiderman comics and the TV show when I was a kid none of the films I've seen as an adult have captured the essence of Spiderman for me and this latest film, I'm afraid, is the worst of them all. In fact it is the worst film I have seen in a long time. By halfway through the film I was struggling to stay awake and before long I was praying for it to end. Had it been on TV I would have switched off but being in the cinema I stayed awake in the hope that the ending would be worth it but it was as predictable as the rest of the film. <br/><br/>I connected with none of the characters at all and couldn't care less what happened to them, the plot had no twists in it that I could see and the acting was dire. Garfield as Spiderman was annoying, Emma Stone was horribly made-up, the ELectro character had potential as a phenomenally powerful villain until you discover he can be made useless with a bucket of water and the only convincing performance was given by Sally Field as Aunt May. <br/><br/>If you're thinking of treating yourself to a good Marvel film then save your money and wait until this comes out on TV. You can then switch it off at will."
"mattwebster077","10","21","64","10 May 2014"," An Amazing Sequel
","I had very high expectations on this sequel as The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) was an amazing film. This film exceeded my expectations. The action was brilliant, casting and special effects were amazing and there was a great use of comedy thrown in there too. Many people say that there was too many villains in the film but I don't see how 3 villains is too much! Speaking of villains, the villain choices were great, Electro's big screen debut was an amazing one as was the Rhino's, and the Green Goblin, I think, was not as good as the Willem Dafoe Goblin but a close second. A VERY close second. One downer was that they killed Gwen Stacey. I didn't like that as she is a strong female character in the Spider-Man universe and much much better than MJ Watson but, if they want to follow the comics, then I guess the Death of Gwen Stacey comic is a brilliant one to follow. Overall, I think The Amazing Spider-Man is truly amazing and I do look forward to The Amazing Spider-Man 3 in 2016 and The Amazing Spider-Man 4 in 2018!"
"mathewmozaffari","7","10","26","18 May 2014"," Great characters and story, but there were minor issues. **SPOILER FREE
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 was a good film. Personally, I am a fan of Spiderman and I enjoyed this film. Here is what I liked about the film: 1) The action was very good and I enjoyed the way they filmed it. In addition, Spiderman swinging around the city was great, especially since they made him interact with the environment and people a lot, thus making the film seem more realistic, instead of having him just focus on the main plot. In addition, the conflicts in the plot were very good. I didn't expect the characters to develop that well, but they did and by linking the villains conflicts together (through Oscorp) the villains stories were very well put. However, the Green Goblin didn't get that much screen time. <br/><br/>I would like to point out that I think that the final fight with Electro was great and suspenseful, but his defeat wasn't that great. The goes with Rhino, who seemed very unnecessary throughout the entire plot. Also, there was lots of CGI used which would usually remove interest from a film, but since it was Electro, the CGI made sense. In addition, the new theme made by Hans Zimmer was good, but it was constantly played during every Spiderman scene, which got annoying. The same goes with the constant dubstep played for Electro. <br/><br/>Another negative factor I would like to point out is the abundance of humour. There was a lot of comedy in the film, which was good and placed, but sometimes there was too much humour. However, the film was also very dark and violent which I liked (especially with the fight between The Green Goblin and Spiderman). <br/><br/>Thirdly, the final negative point about this film was the ending. They usually had an inspirational speech of some sort (which was there, but wasn't the main focus in the end), instead they chose to add a poor conflict in, instead of a ""final swing"" like the other films. <br/><br/>In summary, the film was good, with well times humour and dark moments. The plot was very good, and 2/3 villains had very good plots which interlocked well, creating a great set of villains. However, there were a large group of characters introduced, and a few too many plots which was a lot to work with, but nothing to effect the film in a big way. The filming was great, and the action and plot was very well put together, creating a unique storyline. <br/><br/>9/10"

","This movie is truly just amazing (pun intended). Acting 10/10, Storyline 10/10, Visual Effects 10/10. I honestly can't fault this movie. It is just brilliant. Now, the connection between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is truly amazing (pun). They're on screen relationship seems so real that when Gwen died in the final clock tower fight scene it just makes you want to crawl into a ball and never face reality again, the scene even brought my two friends to tears. Andrew Garfield's acting to when he was holding her lifeless body was just unparalleled. It looked so real.<br/><br/>Visual effects. Best visual effects ever, better than Transformers' visual effects. Better than your visual effects. It just made me want to jump on top of a high speed car, shoot a web to a nearby building and swing off into the daylight with nothing but, freedom on my mind.<br/><br/>The storyline is just brilliant, the first movie was really dramatic (brilliant) and it was just him getting a hold on his footing as Spider-Man. This movie, you can tell that the directors wanted to show Peter Parker as having fun being Spider-Man. And they did everything beautifully. It is just the perfect movie.

"manideepkarne","8","10","26","16 April 2014"," its not amazing its incredible
","The second installment of 'The Amazing Spider-Man' franchise starring Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man was definitely not a disappointment. Not only was the film full of incredible action packed scenes, its humor, wit and charm, particularly with regards to Garfield's portrayal of the beloved superhero, makes this film a must see.<br/><br/>'The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise of Electro', begins with Peter Parker and his love interest Gwen Stacey (played by Emma Stone) graduating from High School, with Gwen receiving the prestigious Honor of valedictorian.<br/><br/>Cracks begin to appear however, as Peter struggles with the promise he made to Gwen's deceased father, that is, to leave her alone, ultimately keeping her safe from all the dangers that come with Peter being Spider-Man.<br/><br/>This battle between his head and heart, paired with the pressures of balancing his ordinary life as Peter Parker, with that of his extraordinary life as Spider-Man, means things get a little complicated for the superhero.<br/><br/>Not to mention that fact he now faces two new and terrifying villains in Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) and friend turned foe Harry Osborn aka The Green Goblin (played by Dane DeHaan).<br/><br/>The internal struggles that Peter faces with regards to his past is also magnified throughout the film, particularly as we learn more about Peter's father and the mysterious company Oscorp. Andrew Garfield and Emma stone's in 'the amazing spider-man 2'.<br/><br/>All of the performances given by the lead cast were consistently strong and impressive. Jamie Foxx was almost unrecognizable, and to be honest a little frightening, as villain Electro, while Dane DeHaan brought a real sinister edge to his character the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Garfield's portrayal of Parker/Spider-Man however, was my favorite. His comedic timing and clever wit was heartwarmingly genuine, which when paired with his adorable demeanor and charm makes you want to melt (well for the ladies that is).<br/><br/>A special mention must also be made with regards to the on screen chemistry between Garfield and Stone. The sparks between these two were truly electrifying (pun intended).<br/><br/>Marc Webb did a fantastic job with directing this film, and his deliberate foreshadowing of what to expect in the next film made for a real cliffhanger.<br/><br/>All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend it. However if you are unfamiliar with the Spider-Man story/franchise, I suggest watching the first film before this, otherwise you may be a little lost."

","I walked out of this movie more upset than when i saw spiderman 3. It started off promising actually. Cool visuals but the actors who he chose for the villains were awful. Electro was just as threatening as napoleon dynamite. He pretty much is napoleon before he changes. The one villain i wanted too see was barely in the movie. If this director could have cut a half hour and focused more on interesting stuff. It could have been great. But no he takes us in this incredible boring journey too fight a nerdy black guy. A not so threatening goblin. Paul (which i love) sounds like a guy who reads stories too your kids in his horrible Russian accent. Which parts of this movie feels like a kids movie. I wasn't a big fan of the first movie but didn't walk away hating it. As much as i did with this one. I can honestly say spiderman 3 is better than this. In my opinion"

"rishabh-kushawah007","1","18","54","1 May 2014"," waste of time and worst remake mixture of spider man 2
","I went in to the theater with high hopes. I did enjoy the first installment of this unnecessary reboot, almost anything seemed like a step up from ""Spiderman 3"", and Garfield felt way more natural than Maguire, and Emma Stone is always welcome. But after seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film. <br/><br/>Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and a blue electric guy.<br/><br/>Oh Jamie Foxx, how did you go from Django to this? Before he goes all CGI-Electro he tries to play the nerdy unseen scientist (with a worse comb-over than Christian Bale's 'Hustle'-look). As Electro it's hard to say how much is his fault, and what can be blamed on the rest, I'd go with the rest. You don't sympathize with him nor do you believe how fast he becomes this super-villain. <br/><br/>Everything that Dane DeHaan did so well in ""Chronicle"" just feels unnatural and (maybe not misplaced, but wrong) here. And his character development is way too rushed and quite unnecessary for this film, it just becomes another sub-plot standing in the way of what really matters. <br/><br/>Sally Field does good work as Aunt May, but leaves no lasting mark. Paul Giamatti's Russian criminal is just in the way and only gives a couple of dreadful and laughable scenes. And then there's the mad German scientist named Kafka and I rest my case. <br/><br/>The action and visuals isn't bad, but still doesn't make up for the low ""trying to be Marvel""-comedy and horrific soundtrack, a soundtrack that almost itself destroys the film throughout the exhausting 142 minutes. And sometimes it feels like the movie is taking us as an audience to be stupid, with pointers to what is going to happen. I would like to say that you might enjoy it if you just try and see it for what it is, but it's hard, but hopefully possible! It had an interesting start, with a glimpse inside the past and Peter's parents, but it's left underdeveloped, as is almost everything else, to make room for all its action and villains.<br/><br/>It's amazing how the difference between two big-budget superhero-movies can be so huge, if you put this against ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", a great and, opposed to this one, original film."
"jogre17","6","9","23","25 July 2014"," Amazing? Indeed it is!
","Unlike a lot of people, I really enjoyed the The Amazing Spider-Man (first movie). I thought that the reboot was necessary for a couple reasons. One, the original series couldn't go anywhere and they were stuck in a rut with this amazing superhero, and two, the original series wasn't very good, at all. Face it, Toby Maguire was not meant to play Spider-Man. I'm not saying Andrew Garfield is the perfect Peter Parker/Spidey, but he definitely does a much better job. Like I said I really enjoyed the first movie. The only thing I questioned was, ""Is The Amazing Spider-Man 2 going to be just as 'amazing' as its predecessor.""<br/><br/>I was worried about that question, and now I have a response to that question. It was even more ""amazing"" than the first one! I love what they did with Jamie Fox and his Electro costume. It was funny when Spider-Man referred to him as ""sparkles."" I thought that the story was well planned out and was definitely paced out well. I look forward to seeing what they will do in the future of Spider-Man, and even in their spin-off plans with ""The Sinister 6"" and ""Venom."" Spider-Man truly is amazing!"

"aryaman-meeshraw","10","9","23","5 May 2014"," The Best Super Hero Movie Ever!!!
","Marc Webb's second outing behind Sony's crown jewel definitely lives up to the name. The Amazing Spiderman 2 was just that, amazing. TASM2 proves to be a thoroughly entertaining, emotional, silly, adept world building film all at the same time. Not one to shy away from it's quirky comic book roots, The Amazing Spiderman 2 does a tremendous job of cementing Spidey as one of the premier superhero franchises on the market .By far the best element of the film is the relationship between Gwen and Peter. Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield have the perfect on- screen chemistry; their portrayal was par perfect. Every time the two of them got together,emotions ran high, the way they transitioned from moments of pure happiness to deep sadness, and then to moments of regret and guilt was nothing short of phenomenal. I can honestly claim that this relationship was the most believable on screen coupling I have ever witnessed, the fact that it happened to be in a comic book film was just icing on the cake. Stone and Garfield embodied the characters in every way and brought intense emotional gravity to an already fantastic film. Marc Webb had already established his prowess of on screen romance so it was no surprise to see him hit it out of the park once again. The way he managed to balance the flashy set pieces with the more intimate, personal story was quite a commendable feat. Had he over tipped his hand in favor of more villain time the climax would not have held near enough emotional weight to justify the severity this development has going forward. That being said, the villains were a miniscule flaw in this otherwise masterful comic adaptation. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon (aka Electro) was a huge goofball and I loved every second he was on screen. I can understand people's complaints with him but I ate it up. Obsession can be a dangerous thing and if handled poorly the consequences could be dire, Spiderman finds this out in the worst way possible and it leads to some truly splendid fights. The way Spiderman moved and quipped mid battle was truly a sight to behold; Sony really nailed the essence of the comic books this time around. Electro's dialogue was just as cheesy as his appearance, while it did result in some cringe worthy lines, ""it's my birthday, time to blow out the candles,"" it never took me out of the movie. The problems begin with ASM2's second villain, Harry Osborn (aka Green Goblin). While his motivations were sound and his portrayal was impeccable (shout out to the always-incredible Dane DeHaan) he did seem a bit rushed. All of the basics were there. He was established as an old friend to Peter, there was a scene dedicated to further exploring their connection and there was a scene in which his dependence on Peter/Spidey turned into loathing. All of the essentials were there. I thought Harry was handled quite well, and the fact the he is undoubtedly returning in further installments is spectacular. The nods to the extended universe were very welcome additions. Setting up plots to be touched upon in the future while giving hawk-eyed fans something to look for in repeat viewings. Dr. A.Smythe (played by The Office's BJ Novak) was a pleasant addition and added to Electro's early struggles making him a more complete character in my eyes. The other major comic book Easter egg was the Rhino (Paul Giamatti). He didn't play a huge role but I think his cameo, albeit cool, could have been handled a little better. However, the fact that he only appears for about 4 minutes makes this a non-issue. The Amazing Spiderman 2 elaborates on loose story threads from the first outing while introducing a plethora of new elements implying spin-offs and sequels. Webb manages to balance the bombast and the personal with pin point precision and ends up with a fantastic, or shall I say amazing, film. While certain things could have been handled a bit better the end product is definitely worthy of its title and leaves audiences on the edge of their seats. I can't wait to further explore the inner workings of Oscorp and see what mess Peter Parker gets himself into next."

","From the opening of this movie, I could feel the inner comics fan boy squeal in ethereal happiness. Every sequence packed a punch. Marc Webb struck the balance perfectly between action and humour, staying true to Spidey's character. Every part of the film stayed true to the comics, and various story arcs. The acting, the action, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield's on screen chemistry. Everything was spot on. I feel that Rhino and Green Goblin could have been expanded upon more, although I was delighted with Goblin's new look. Gwen's ambiguous fate also leaves room for a sequel, which I look forward to seeing. My verdict? A fantastic action film that will please die hard fans and film lovers alike. Definitely a must see.

","Groundbreaking effects, huge actions scenes and memorable characters and actors! Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man / Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is back on the big screen in this gripping story about a boy who has the powers of a spider. He's up against Electro / Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a man seeking attention, Harry Osborn / Green Goblin (Dane DaHaan), Peter's best friend and Spider-Man's foe, while still having to keep a promise and not uncover his parents' secret. <br/><br/>In this film, the writers allocate more time to show the alter-ego of Peter Parker without making it run too long or lose the action. The strong relationship between all the characters, whether it's love or hatred is all 3-Dimensional. It helps when you have capable actors filling these roles. <br/><br/>The story creates a darker look at being a hero and throws in some comic book jokes once in a while. This movie had a chance of becoming too unfocused. It has two villains to establish, the romance between Peter and Gwen, Peter trying to figure out the truth about his parents' past and more. However, with the help of a very talented director, Marc Webb and wonderful writers, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner, they pick a goal for the plot and follow through with it, while bringing all the actors' story arcs together naturally. <br/><br/>The special effects in this film are beyond amazing! Electro's design makes him the most unique villain. The special effect's department really gets creative on how Spider-Man moves and fights, especially when he's in spider-sense mode and everything slows down. <br/><br/>I gained a new respect for Jamie Foxx who portrays my favorite character Electro / Max Dillon. He plays a menacing villain, but also shows the tragic and even pathetic side of Max Dillon. On the Google+ Hangout which I was fortunate to be part of, Jamie confided that he ""based this character on a person he knew."" Behind all the CGI you see Jamie honor this person. <br/><br/>The battle in Times Square between Electro and Spider-Man in my favorite scene. It encompasses all the incredible CGI effects mentioned. It's where Max finally gets attention, once he gets his powers and he sees himself on T.V. When Electro says, ""You see me?"" You genuinely feel sorry for him. The moral of this story is, ""It doesn't matter how hard you fall, it matters how fast you get back up."" Peter goes through a life changing event and can't move on. However, in a clever and Marvel way, Aunt May gives Peter some advice that changes things.<br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 10- to 18-year-olds. There are violent and intense scenes that some kids may not be able to handle, but this is a marvelous adaptation of Spider-Man. It will be released in theaters nationwide on May 2.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more film reviews to to kidsfirst dot org."
"RolandFlagg","4","8","20","8 May 2014"," an hour too long, a lot of talking without really saying much
","Went in to the theater expecting a fun, action-filled superhero movie, came out of the theater disappointed. For a 2 1/2 hour long movie, TASM2 was not able to tell a very coherent story, nor was it able to really develop any of its characters in a believable way, with the possible exception of Gwen. Both villains went through too quick of a transformation for me to suspend belief. While the romance between Peter and Gwen had some merits due to the real-life chemistry from the two actors, it over-saturated the film and was a major distraction from what the movie was actually about - Spiderman. The action scenes were too short and sparse in between for the number of villains present in this movie (3!!!) I came away not really knowing what this movie was about. <br/><br/>Is it about the love story between Peter and Gwen? (But how does that make it a superhero movie) Is it about the evils of corporations? (They referred to it, but it was mostly in the background) Is it about the dangers of self-absorption? (yes, it was the cause of both major villains, but again, point not emphasized). Compare with the Marvel Studios movies that came out recently, one is able to pinpoint to exactly their themes: Captain America - a clash between ideologies on how to achieve world peace, emphasizing on American freedom, with very clear villains (Hydra); Thor - a fantasy story where previously evil defeated creatures try to plunge the world once again in darkness and must be overcome by the good guys, not as deep as Captain America, but nevertheless entertaining because it follows a clear plot line; Iron Man - the struggle of someone who's coping with PTSD and struggling with his identity, exploring the ideas of people wearing masks and deception. Not to mention that the Marvel Studio films were jam- packed with action and keeping the viewer absorbed throughout the entire run-time. Compare that with TASM2, where I was wondering where the villains were and what the conflict was half way into the movie and thinking that it was way too long. This movie could do itself a lot of favors by sticking to just one villain (Electrode) and develop him further, and cut out the romance by half. As it stands, while this movie had some beautiful effects and cool first-person views of Spider Man, it falls short in the story department."
"jimspencer7","5","8","20","7 May 2014"," Loss of Innocence
","I took my Grandson to see this movie, as that is a favorite thing that we like to do together. I can draw on my youth when I remember reading the comic books, giving me a perspective that not all people have, as I have followed Spidey for a number of years. To this day I love movies and the many Super Heroes that are written about, and especially those that make it to the big screen. All of that to say this.....there was something that was lacking in this version of Spider-Man, and even my Grandson noticed it as well. Kids have an amazing perceptive ability, and are an amazing little barometer for truthfulness. Both of us were wondering early on what happened to M.J.(Mary Jane), and he even asked me why the Green Goblin was changed up. He even commented on the change to Electro. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst & James Franco delivered a certain innocence to the characters that more resembled the way Stan Lee wrote the original story-line. In this version, Andrew Garfield seemed much less innocent, Dane DeHaan was a poor replacement for Harry Osborn, and lest we forget, Emma Stone instead of M.J. was really far-fetched. Her make-up made her look anything but innocent. One of the biggest draws to Spider-Man is in his transformation from an almost bumbling photographer, into his still somewhat innocent alter-ego as the masked hero, Spider-Man.All of that was gone in this version....begging the question..Why change up a winning formula? A lot of action....but empty on most cylinders."
"Nickster123","9","8","20","2 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider-man 2 is Amazing
","Garfield is Spider-man; that much I think we can all agree. He fills out the character with displays of wit and an emotional depth so in-tune with who Spider-man is that he deserves accolades. This movie shows you what it is to be Spider-man. Previous films have shown web slinging, Spidey-sense, combat, and his relationships to varying degrees of success, but never so greatly as this one.<br/><br/>The flapping fabric of the suit, the sheer vertigo (can't wait to see it in 3D), and sense of speed all combine to make you feel what it's like to be Spidey. It's awesome! When things get too hectic, the action slows down letting you soak it all in. The style is spot-on and nothing feels over done, which is fantastic because Jamie Foxx as Electro is quite the visually demanding villain. His performance is superb, as with all the starring cast. The writing and editing, combined with A+ actors, creates a believable, naturally progressing story line. One that draws you in for the ride and then, to really hook you, add Hans Zimmer's soundtrack on top of that. It's the frosting on the cake, and it's so good that you go for a corner piece. The only way the this movie disappointed was the fact that there wasn't more (also, I could have used more Paul Giamatti). <br/><br/>Definitely a set-up for future movies, so I can't wait to see where Spidey goes next. Highly recommend!"
"briz_boy_10","6","8","20","25 April 2014"," Nothing special I'm afraid.
","Perhaps I'm being slightly harsh when i rate this movie a 6/10, but honestly I don't think its deserving of anything more.<br/><br/>The movie contains some good action sequences that we'd expect from our wall crawling friend, and the film has heart, but there is too much lacking with the final product. Andrew Garfield is a good spider man, and Emma Stone an equally good Gwen Stacy..and I have no problem with Sally Field either. However, i feel that the casting of the rest of the cast was completely wrong!Jamie Foxx as electro? He would have made a better'Kraven the Hunter'to be honest, and what the hell is up with the appearance of electro? I felt like I was watching Dr Manhattan from Watchmen. Dane Dehaan i like, but he doesn't compare to James Francos Harry Osborne, and i think they could have chosen someone better. I don't really feel like we got anywhere in the story of his parents or Oscorp to really care, or feel excited for the next one either.<br/><br/>I'm a huge MARVEL fan, and in particular Spider Man and admittedly this reboot does feel more like the comics, but in all honesty, as much as I really didn't want to slate this movie, the original THREE were better than this one. <br/><br/>Obviously everyone has their own opinion, and i respect that, but this felt way too rushed and was rather plain."
"s_campanale","8","8","20","16 April 2014"," Spider man 2 Electro Boogaloo - Memories of flaccid first instalment swept away by powerful and dramatic sequel.
","Sony's first reboot installment in 2012 was justly criticised for being a poorly scripted rehash of Raimi's original a decade earlier, cheap and tacky looking with hardly any spider action and a poorly motivated villain, a chick flick masquerading as a superhero blockbuster existing solely so Sony could maintain the rights. However, in a rare case of people listening, the second movie is a massive step up in quality and integrity which puts to shame most of official Marvel's underwhelming recent offerings.<br/><br/>The storyline sticks quite closely to that of the comics (something the original trilogy didn't) and closes many of the loopholes of movie 1 while opening a myriad doors to future instalments.<br/><br/>There are four main plot strands here (1) Peter Parker's success as Spiderman and his conflicted feelings about his relationship with Gwen Stacey, especially the vow he made to her dying father, a vow whose casual dismissal now literally haunts him. (2) The succession of Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborn to the OSCORP throne and the dirty politics and inherited genetic condition that killed his father and is now starting to blight him too, leading to the desperate search for a cure that seemingly only Spiderman can provide. (3) The tragedy of lonely and ignored OSCORP tech Max Dillon, whose stalkerish obsession with Spiderman after a chance encounter turns deadly when an unlikely industrial accident involving electric eels turns him into 'Electro', a being of living electricity who can drain a city and control a cities fate. (4) The true story of Peter's parents, who on a pre-credit sequence are shown fighting an evil OSCORP assassin in a Learjet and whose motive for running is revealed by some underground detective work. Book ending the movie is a blink and you'll miss it turn by Paul Giamatti as Russian mobster Aleksei Sytseivich, who is recruited to Osborn's 'League of Evil' as ""Rhino"" in a mech suit 'Avatar' would envy. But don't get too excited because the film ends just as they are starting to battle!<br/><br/>The acting all round is fine. Garfield, criticised for being too cocky last time, is more mature and grounded this time, and his emotional scenes have real power. He is well matched by Dane DeHaan, who has made a career out of troubled angry loners, and gives Osborn enough pathos to make you pity him even as he does awful things. Emma Stone as Gwen is again excellent, funny and intelligent yet hiding a secret pain that's always there in the corner. Jamie Foxx as Dillon makes for both a sad and pitiful loner, desperate to be even acknowledged by anyone, and an increasingly angry and embittered Electro. His 'master plan' involves making the city bow to him and acknowledge his power, which is sad enough in itself. Sally Field again plays a younger, trimmer, more energetic Aunt May, doing some fiery dramatics of her own. Also appearing are Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn, bitter,dying and green, Colm Feore as the shady OSCORP king maker whose more actual villain than either Electro or The Green Goblin, and an unrecognisable Martin Csokas as a stereotypical sadistic German scientist.<br/><br/>Unlike TAS, the pacing and the mix of action and drama is far better, and it reaches the emotional and dramatic heights of Raimi's trilogy with actors better suited to the material (You do not want to throttle Stone, unlike the whiny selfish needy Kirsten Dunst! And they have the Parker-Osborn dynamic right here, unlike the Raimi series which switched the original roles around with disastrous consequences.) The special effects are OK but not brilliant, and Electro could have been more ground breaking and breathtaking, but surprisingly it doesn't make too much difference here. Kudos must also be given for following through with a faithful enactment of the Goblin-Gwen Stacey storyline, something of an open secret already, hence the heavy Greek tragedy style foreshadowing throughout the movie. They do not sell it short and it delivers the required emotional punch.<br/><br/>A strong superhero movie at a time when such things are increasingly scarce, an astounding step up from the feeble initial instalment that provides fine Summer thrills with a solid dramatic backbone and promises much from director Webb and his team for future episodes."
"embedrei","3","15","44","11 May 2014"," Spidey's losing battle against Super Annoying & Mega Unpleasant
","The second part isn't better than the first one. It has a few nice moments, but most of the time it makes you wonder - again - if there is a tough competition in Hollywood to produce the most illogical and insultingly stupid blockbuster ever.<br/><br/>Just a few things that really annoyed me: <br/><br/>Peter was 4 when his parents disappeared. His father had developed the genetically enhanced spider that sat in the lab for over 10 years, until Peter accidentally stepped into the room and was bitten.<br/><br/>When the father tries to escape from the powers that want to misuse his invention, leaving little Peter with Aunt May, he records a final video message. He explains that he used his own DNA and that the spiders therefore work their intended magic only with himself as the key. No, he says: ""with my bloodline"", thus throwing young Peter to the wolves. If one of the baddies would have gotten wind of this, he would have made Peter his lab rat.<br/><br/>It is implied that any other one, bitten by the spider would have died a horrible death. Fortunately they only bite Peter Parkers.<br/><br/>When Harry Osborn learns that he has inherited the same disease his father is dying of he acts like there's no tomorrow. But he's got more than 30 years, an eternity - just compare a Commodore 64 from 1984 to a normal smart phone.<br/><br/>Harry and Peter are supposed to be best friends. Here they are just childhood buddies, who haven't seen each other for 8 years. The news announce that Harry inherited the Osborn fortune - and Peter pops up at his door. ""I know exactly what you are going through right now. You were so there for me when my parents ... That's why I'm here for you."" Kindergarten friends are forever. Is the author of this super awkward dialogue from outer space? <br/><br/>Peter and Gwen are supposed to be deeply in love. But during the whole movie they are on the brink of a break up. There's not the tiniest bit of chemistry between them. Gwen is pushy and annoying. When Spidey fights the deadly Electro, she gets herself into the front-line, because she thinks she has to tell Peter some very basic facts about electricity. Peter is a science whiz himself, didn't the authors know that?<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx plays a half-wit that no company in the world would let get close to their high-end electric devices. An annoying stereotype from the fifties, when Jerry Lewis was considered to be funny.<br/><br/>Gwen (Emma Stone) looks terribly pedestrian, Harry (Dane DeHaan) like a young madman, and the ""teenaged"" Andrew Garfield (born 1983) is dull & unsympathetic. Kudos to the casting department and the director.<br/><br/>The Rhino scene with a little boy in a Spider-Man costume throwing himself into the line of fire is super annoying in oh so many ways. It's like showing a boy getting rescued by Superman after jumping off a high building, because he thought his Superman costume would turn him into the man himself. Criminally insane. Rhino's suit/tank looks quite impressive, but when the action starts the movie ends, leaving the audience with an unpleasant sense of frustration."

","This was my first D-BOX experience,and I have to say it was amazing.And it definitely helped that this film was incredible.Didn't think for one second it would be better than Andrew Garfield's first outing as spidey,but it so was. The special effects were outstanding,but with this type of film,you would expect nothing less.And although it is laden with special effects,I thought this was a very character driven movie,with some wonderful actors. I think Andrew Garfield is a very good actor,and I am so looking forward to him giving a performance as good as he did in Boy A(2007).I was impressed with Dane Dehaan(who reminded me of a young Leonardo Dicaprio)and I will have to check out some more of his films this weekend.Jamie Fox made a very good villain.I was wary when I heard there was going to be three villains in the film,but it works very well.Shame we have to wait till 2016 for the next spider man film,but I do hope they keep the same director,Marc Webb on board,he is another talent to keep an eye on."
"ghiz876","10","18","55","30 April 2014"," Another fantastic instalment - major spoilers
","While the Sam Raimi trilogy was... fun, it was by no means the series of films Spider-Man deserved. Although people are determined to hate them for some reason, both the first Amazing Spider-Man and this one were excellent in my view. Not perfect but definitely worthy Spider-Man films. With the wisecracking Spider-Man we know and love (except for in the Raimi films, where he cracks about 4 jokes over the trilogy, half of which suck), a love interest who makes her own decisions and isn't a bitch for no reason and relatable villains, this film has everything I came to expect from its predecessor.<br/><br/>The relationship between Peter and Gwen is further explored, carrying on from the dilemma the first film gave, which was that Gwen's father's dying wish was for Peter to stay away from Gwen so that she could be safe. The two still deeply want to be together but Peter suffers guilt from the dying wish of Captain Stacey. In addition, Gwen's path in life seems to be diverging from Peter's. Peter ultimately sees that Gwen is going to make her own decisions in life, regardless of his own indecision.<br/><br/>While the relationship between the two certainly has many different interesting aspects and a satisfying conclusion, I felt it could have handled the issue of Captain Stacey's dying wish better. We're thrown right into Peter and Gwen trying to go against his wish and because we never see their initial justification for it, I personally felt like I didn't really 'get' them at times. Fortunately, satisfactory justification and possible solutions are provided later in the film. So while there were certain weaknesses in the relationship earlier on, overall it is very interesting.<br/><br/>The villain of the piece is Electro. A choice I was initially wary of, as Electro never stood out to me very much. I was hoping for somebody more interesting like Mysterio. However, this was a unique take on Electro and one I really got behind. They took the initial idea of Max Dillon being a nobody who becomes a villain and decided to actually do something interesting with it. He hates being a nobody, he wants to be recognised. But of course, when the world is forced to notice him when he becomes Electro, he is perceived as a freak. Take this crushing blow with the fact that Spider-Man, his idol, is tasked with keeping Electro from harming anyone intentionally or otherwise and there's a villain with a lot of potential.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Electro's story ends up being the lowest point of the film. The flaws start with the heavy-handed rushing of Electro's motivation. Somebody shoots at him while Spider-Man's talking with him and Electro takes this as confirmation that Spider-Man was setting him up and is determined to kill him and destroy the city. Spider-Man, meanwhile, makes no attempt to reason with or sympathise with Electro from this point on. The result is a character who reached the final point of his arc too quickly and a hero who comes across as apathetic and really not heroic at all.<br/><br/>In the end, Electro abruptly is blown up as a result of Spider-Man and Gwen's teamwork. This is a perfect opportunity for Gwen to realise what a monstrous thing she's had to do as a result of choosing to stay by Spider-Man's side, killing a man in order to do what is right. Spider- Man meanwhile could have lamented on how it had to come to killing Max rather than helping him and what he's now burdened Gwen with. Faced with the dark sides of Spider-Man's quests, they could then have progressed into what comes next... instead, it's not even talked about, Harry comes in and Electro is a mere footnote.<br/><br/>Harry, while certainly a departure from the more lighthearted and warm character we're used to, was done rather well. From the beginning, there is a sense of menace and potential for power lurking within him, it's obvious that it's coming, due to his unfortunate association with Oscorp. Harry is both entertaining and threatening at the same time. And that's before he puts the Goblin suit on. From that point on, he's pure threatening, as long as you make sure to overlook his silly hair. In all seriousness, the sense of impending doom from the moment he swoops in on his glider and his unrelenting viciousness comes into play very well. Anyone familiar with the comics knows that Gwen is well and truly marked for death from the moment he grabs her. The poetic imagery in the clock tower and the menacing close-ups of Green Goblin hammer in the gravity of the situation. When Gwen finally falls, a shiver went up my spine, as I knew that was the decisive moment.<br/><br/>On the whole, this was an excellent film that continued the story of the previous very well. The problems in Peter and Gwen's relationship are explored and the potential dark side of taking on the role of Spider-Man certainly comes into play. With Peter having had a bitter taste of the repercussions of his life mission and the Goblin still alive, there's certainly potential for us to now see a dark side of Peter himself. Here's hoping for him to give Harry a beatdown mirroring the one he gave Norman!Goblin in the comics. With other potential threads set up for the future such as Harry's assistant Felicia, who will hopefully become Black Cat, serving as an ally to Spider-Man who is somewhat familiar with what he does and the Sinister Six – which will hopefully mean Mysterio – there's plenty to look forward to, in addition to the greatness of this film to reflect on."
"badguy_jin","10","18","55","25 April 2014"," This movie is EPIC!!!
","First of all, need to mention the cast's performance, which was amazing including also Jamie Foxx as Electro and Dane Dehaan as Green goblin. I really liked the way these two bad-ass villains were developing through the movie. Each of them had enough of their own space in the movie they needed to get the attention of the audience thanks to which the movie does not feel like there are too many villains in it who do not even get enough of time for developing. Since the acting of Jamie and Dane was so convincing I really felt I could put myself in their place as they were going through different life situations and obstacles which led them to changing into such baddies. The moment when Max Dillon changed into Electro was really cool. <br/><br/>The moment when Harry shows up as the Green goblin is terrific, I must admit this guy Dane Dehaan steals the show from Electro. Before he appears right after the battle between Spidey and Electro you hear him laughing, and I was thinking here comes the Green goblin. His laugh is just as creepy as it was from a horror which is exactly how it is supposed to be. Even though the Green goblin does not get much of the screen time, right from the moment he appears I somehow felt so worried about Gwen. Many people keep saying the movie is bad because the Green goblin is in the movie for just a few minutes but I think that it is because Marc Webb wanted him to be also in the next film, and Harry was actually behind the whole vengeance plan against Spiderman involving Electro thus he did not need too much screen time as Green goblin. Even despite his short screen time as the Green goblin he managed to steal the show definitely leaving me wanting to see him in the third film. This is finally the Green goblin that is actually scary and creepy. Dane Dehaan is perfect for tne role.<br/><br/>Another thing I want to point out is the visuals and cgi. This films action sequences are mind blowing!!! I have seen all superhero movies which had amazing visuals, cgi etc., but this is really another level. The web-swinging of Spidey is so unbelievably realistic that it really does not look like cgi. Who knows, it could have been Andrew doing all the web-swinging himself (that would be amazing - just kidding). I hope there is going to be more action scenes in the next sequels though. However in this case I enjoyed every moment of the film, even non-action sequences. <br/><br/>Another credit goes to Hans Zimmer for scoring the music background of this film. The music was just spectacular and it fitted to every single scene of the movie. A real ear candy was the moment when Spidey and Electro were fighting and Electro was flipping Spidey with his electricity power from side to side, kind of like playing ping pong with him, the music was so sick in this scene!!!<br/><br/>I think that most of the people will agree with me that Andrew is perfect as Peter aka Spiderman and that he and Emma share a great chemistry on screen. They both make their love story so believable and interesting that I would also want to be in Peter's shoes when it comes to being a superhero loved by such a super-smart and super-cute Gwen Stacy portrayed by the beautiful Emma Stone. And it does not seem like twilight at all as many people are writing here in reviews. The scenes with Peter and Gwen are actually quite entertaining as I had a few laughs watching them. The fact that Andrew and Emma portrayed their roles so well makes the finale of the movie even more emotional and tragic. <br/><br/>I am glad that it did not end with the saddest moment in the movie. The ending scene which I thought would be in the beginning of the movie was actually very cool, leaving me so hyped-up for the next film. If you are interested in how much of the screen time Paul Giamatti had for the Rhino, then I can tell you it is just really short. However, I think it is pretty smart to do so as Rhino would not have enough of time in the movie anyway as Electro and Green goblin stole the show. Therefore; I think that Rhino will have longer screen time in the next movie along with other villains who are to come. <br/><br/>Even though I went to see the movie with very high expectations based on so many footage that were released before the actual premiere I was quite surprised how the movie turned out to be. It has humor, drama, action, breathtaking moments and everything. Now I just can't wait for The amazing spider-man 3!<br/><br/>Im so sick of reading some of the reviews here that are all about Webb's Spidey vs Raimi's Spidey.

","In 2012 Sony announced that Jaime fox was going to play electro I did not know what to think because being a huge Spiderman fan like myself I was really disappointed with the mark web Spiderman. So when I went in to go see it I did not know what to except. I sat down with my popcorn and soda watching the amazing Spiderman 2 in rpx. When the movie was done I was speechless like everything of the movie was good. I wanted to see it again and in fact I am going to see it later. Everything in the movie was good like the soundtrack and the way they killed Gwen Stacy. Also the way harry turns into the goblin harry wanted Spiderman's blood because he was dying and Spiderman blood cells could have made him immortal because the spider that bit peter where spiders that could help people live and kill any disease,. SO harry gets one spider and then turns into the goblin and now wants to kill Spiderman. I love this movie. Best Spiderman Movie I've seen"

"Chaos-one","1","14","41","5 May 2014"," Very disappointing. (Minor Spoiler Alert)
","With an estimated 200 million dollar budget, my expectations for this movie was very high. There were some scenes that felt very unnatural. There were certain lines that did not flow very well on a few scenes. Andrew Garfield does not perform some of the scenes very well especially when he is playing spider man's part. There were certain parts of the movie where I felt the pace could have moved much faster. The pace was so slow that as a viewer, it was not able to keep me interested to want to continue watching every scene. The relationship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn could have been better developed. There were some scenes that were very cheesy. For example, Spider web shaped like a hand."
"tonybaiden","8","10","27","17 April 2014"," Amazing-ish
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is certainly a special film, consisting of magnificent action, spectacular special-effects and amazing performances from the likes of Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan, oh, and there certainly is a superior story.<br/><br/>I am one who believes Andrew Garfield is a better Spider-Man compared to Tobey Maguire and this film secured my thoughts. Jamie Foxx was a commendable Electro, Emma Stone was the beyond average love interest, but the star of the show was Dane DeHaan's flawless Harry Osborn. All these actors and many more showed the emotional depth the characters needed and embodied the personalities from the comics perfectly.<br/><br/>The script and story was the same old Spider-Man formula, only it was told in such a compelling way that it was a film of its own. My only problem with the script refers to Paul Giamatti, whose dialogue felt a bit flat. The pacing of the film was a bit iffy, as if the start was rushed, but it found a suitable speed half-way through.<br/><br/>The visuals were flawless, maybe a front-runner for this years VFX Academy Award. It created such a vibrant picture, introducing epic eye- candy.<br/><br/>I was not fond of James Horner's score for the first Spidey reboot, but Hans Zimmer, he is the king of film composing. The soundtrack was phenomenal and creates a perfect image of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a nice, visual blockbuster, but had a few issues, so I give it a 7.5/10, behind Spider-Man 2 and The Amazing Spider-Man."

"Rob_Taylor","5","6","14","27 July 2014"," Dull, overlong and unconvincing.
","After sitting through this endurance test, I'm consoling myself with the fact that, in maybe five to ten years time, they will reboot the franchise again and have another go at getting it right.<br/><br/>Spiderman 2 is about forty minutes too long. There is so much unnecessary backstory and drivel in here that it is painful to sit through. I mean, if we didn't know Spiderman's story to death thanks to the fact that we've had now five movies in twelve years essentially rehashing the same story, it wouldn't be so bad. But we have had those movies. Even if you hated the Tobey Maguire trilogy, you still remember the story, right? So why do they feel the need to go over the same ground again and again is beyond me. Perhaps they think that ten years equates to a ""new generation"" of movie-goers. I don't know.<br/><br/>Anyway, what you do get is one hundred and forty minutes of same old, same old. Same old angst-driven spidey not knowing whether he wants the girl or not. Yawn.<br/><br/>As far as villains go, they couldn't even leave green goblin to die. They had to resurrect him in the form of his son. I have no idea whether this is canon in the comics or not, but it is a cheap way to bring back an old character.<br/><br/>Whilst I'm on about cheap writing... is there no one writing screenplays anymore that don't have dialogue and scenes you can predict well in advance? I mean, if I know what a character is going to say before they say it, despite being distracted by shiny CGI and technowizardry, what does that say about how long it took the writer to come up with the crap? When I sat down to watch this, I realised that I couldn't remember a single thing that happened in the previous movie and, I suspect the same will be true when I inevitably go and watch Spiderman 3. They are just watch and forget movies.<br/><br/>The one thing that they sort of got right was spidey's humour, at least in the first ten minutes. After that, there was precious little to smile about, let me tell you! CGI is abundant, of course and, at least for the characters, not too shabby. Apart from being a clone of Mr Freeze from the Batman movies, Electro looked the part.<br/><br/>Where the CGI scored less well, however, is in my favourite pet hate... physics abuse. Spiderman swings about on his webs with ridiculous speed. It's like he is rocket propelled half the time, even when simply falling straight down. Also, I get he's virtually indestructible, but Gwen isn't. There is a scene where he swoops down on his web and snatches her from a standing position and swoops away, all with out stopping. Not only would that have killed her then and there from the impact, but his speed would have dropped considerably. Does no one look at this and think ""You know what...that's stupid."" during the film-making process? The plot was a mess. The dialogue trite and cheesy in equal measure and the characterisations were woeful. Not since Anakin Skywalkers ineptly orchestrated turning to the dark-side have I seen such awful ham-fisted about-faces for character motivations. Mild mannered techno-nerd Max becomes evil Electro simply because Spiderman forgot his name. Harry Osborne goes from Peter Parker's best friend to psychotic lunatic in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>It's all rather tragic, really. But the real tragedy, considering how many people put at least some effort into it, is this: Even now, mere hours after watching it, the details are hazy. I might suspect early-onset Alzheimer's, except that I can recall with painful clarity even other poor recent movies such as Godzilla. So this tells me that Spiderman 2 will be a movie forgotten in ten years time. No one will be able to tell you what happened in it without looking it up.<br/><br/>And you know what? Perhaps that is for the best.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Dull, too long and instantly forgettable. People will be talking about this film for minutes after they have left the theatre. Almost any other superhero movie is more enjoyable."
"cwatkinson321","7","6","14","18 May 2014"," Everything you could want from a spidey film
","Been waiting for the film for ages and Marc Webb didn't disappoint, everything you could want from a spidey film in addition to the best suit we've ever had. The one liners and the opening to the film instantly brings a smile to your face as it's exactly like a spiderman comic or cartoon. The only reason I haven't given it 10 is the fact that we don't see goblin enough which was annoying as Dane Dehaan plays him so well with a completely different persona. Can't wait to see what Marc Webb does with the next film and I'm expecting him to go for a darker movie as the ending of the film ( not giving too much away ) will have a huge impact on peter and will effect the way he acts in himself as well as spider-man"
"PedroRosRod","3","15","45","5 May 2014"," The most terrible ending I'ever seen in a movie!!! It screwed the whole film up!!!
","Just as I said in the headline,a movie totally messed by the last 10 minutes of the story.Unbelievably, it's also the best Spiderman movie I've ever seen. How can they create such a lovable character,actually the one that spices up the movie, and then kill it? What a huge contrast. If this a reboot with some many things different from the original one ALREADY, why didn't they just leave Gwen and forget MJ?<br/><br/>This movie shows one of the most disappointing deaths in the comics world.That's why I dislike so much this one. If you're either a robot or a 10 years boy who still doesn't know what love is about, then you can go and watch this movie and not dislike it at all!!Otherwise,focus only on the action."
"Voice-OF-Reality","8","5","11","3 May 2014"," Unpredictable and great
","The standard keeps getting higher and higher for this type of movie because so many have been made. Its getting very hard to show the audience something new they haven't seen already. I think most of the negative reviews here are a result of that. <br/><br/>One thing I liked about TASM2 is how it doesn't follow the typical ""safe"" and very predictable story arc formula from start to finish. The movie is very unpredictable and you really don't know whats going to happen from one scene to the next. The movie plays like a real comic from start to finish with no formal beginning or ending. It just flows. When it starts you feel like you are right in the middle of the movie and when it ends it feels the same way. Like an episode of Breaking Bad. This is unusual, but refreshing. It really plays like a comic book.<br/><br/>Now the problems:<br/><br/>1. Electro was kind of a lame villain. But this is just my personal opinion of him overall. He isn't worthy of being a movie villain. I would of left him in the comics and found someone more interesting. To follow the Lizard with Electro is weak.<br/><br/>2. A different world. In some ways this movie didn't feel like the same world as the first one. Kind of the feeling you get when a franchise changes directors, but we still have Marc Webb so that's clearly not the reason. <br/><br/>In the first movie there were more practical effects and Spider-Man was more frail. He got injured more easily and was held back easier. In this movie he is back to the level of the Raimi movies where his is almost invincible. WTF? He doesn't get injured throughout the entire movie. This is a first for a Spider-Man movie. It seemed Marc Web wanted to focus more on his emotional pain.. so he didn't give him much physical pain. <br/><br/>3. A bridge movie. This movie felt more like a bridge from the first movie to the third movie than its own stand alone. It spends the first half tying up or continuing story lines from the first movie and the second half setting up for the 3rd movie. <br/><br/>BUT.. maybe Marc Webb is doing this to avoid another Spider-Man 3. Third installments have a reputation for sucking and a big reason they usually suck is because by the time you get to the third movie, there isn't anymore story to tell or character development to do. <br/><br/>Like I said earlier.. the movie starts and ends very abruptly as if its just part of a bigger story. Maybe Marc Webb is trying to make the series one long movie instead of the usual connected stand alones we usually see in franchises. <br/><br/>4. Too much slow motion. It was done too often and got annoying by the 100th time. <br/><br/>But I enjoyed the movie overall. Still better than the Raimi films. Andrew Garfield is light-years ahead of Toby Maguire."
"dmax-artfreak","8","5","11","2 May 2014"," What in the actual heck are the critics talking about?
","Sure, it had an occasionally choppy narrative, and I personally didn't like how short-lived the Goblin was, but besides that, GREAT movie! I'd give it an 8/10. The acting was excellent (2 points), the music was exhilarating (2 points),the overall story was enthralling (2 points), and the action was extravagant (2 points - I know, I purposefully used all ""e"" words, haha). I was worried as I was walking into the theater because people were saying that it was the equivalent to Batman Forever, but I really don't understand what they were saying. Yeah, there were a few silly moments, but this is to be expected in a Spider-Man movie (does the ""raindrops"" song ring a bell for you Raimi-lovers?). Spider- Man is a goofy character, and it's one of the reasons why we love him so much. Not only was the comedy a nice plus, but this movie possessed heart and charm, something that is rare in a superhero movie. Gwen and Peter's relationship isn't your typical Twilight romance. Their chemistry made me care about them, and made me want to know more about their relationship, and her death made me shed a manly-tear. I also liked how Webb pulled out all the stops and went all out with the action - the effects were top-notch, it was intense, well-choreographed, and it made some great eye-candy. All of this to say, I truly am surprised by all the negative feedback. I, being a huge Spider-Man fan, encourage you to forget the reviews and see it for yourself. It's without a doubt the best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2, and I can't wait to see it again."
"ankitgopinath95","10","16","49","3 May 2014"," Why some people don't get the awesomeness
","Now overall even I have to admit that as a portrayal of story there was not much to be said, but honestly, f*** that. People love to point out the flaws in everything and tick off the points from a 5/5 rating until you get a semi-decent score which reflects that you liked the movie but you have higher taste and don't want to waste your appraisal on so clear an action-superhero movie. These ''people'' i so so name are most of the movie critics you read about on the internet or watch on TV. I spit on them and their ''taste''. I loved the movie, it was a mixture of comedy and pure awesome moments to make even the crankiest of movie goers swoon. Now I'm not saying it was the best movie ever made or that it had no flaw, but I'm just saying that we keep underrating everything we love in hopes for something better to come along. Because if we admit that something is so joyous and amazing, it leaves the hope for all future prospects bleak and dim. Like a faint future. But in doing so we disable our ability to appreciate what we have, I am putting a stop to that and rating this movie a 10/10, because thats how much I enjoyed it. F*** the taste, F*** the class. This movie had both and it's time for the critics to open their eyes a little and expand their mind beyond movies regarding physically disabled poor and down trodden men and women fighting against race and poverty based on a true story in the middle of a war with a tragic rape scene somewhere in the middle. Those movies are special in their own way, but so is Spiderman 2, and even when I'm old i may very well show this movie to my kids and there's not a damn thing anyone can do about it."

Even if I am a small bit biased with Electro being my favourite villain ever in spiderman! :) Some people say that green goblin(harry) was under developed and yes he was. However I actually liked it that way. I like having one great villain. They also probably didn't want to repeat the same mistakes Spiderman 3 did and have too many villains.<br/><br/>The action scenes were really well done. I know some people who thought there was too much effects and your eyes felt like popping, but it didn't really bother me all that much.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer shows his genius once again. Adding dupstep to Electro's scenes was pure perfection.

"eliasbelrhiti","2","2","3","24 June 2020"," The Worst Spider-Man Movie
","I have seen quite a few of negative reviews about ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" and the Andrew Garfield franchise as a whole, so I had quite low expectations for the two movies. While the first movie was alright (5/10), this one was not good at all, the acting lost its authenticity, Garfield's performance in this movie is the most inauthentic Spider-Man performance I have seen. Other supporting actors such as Foxx and Stone were okay but did not do much to stand out. The plot is messy and I do not understand why 2 villains, Electro was suffifcent and the final battle was not really enternaining to watch. Some of the visual effects were alright in this movie, but other most prominent effects such as Electro and the Electric visual effects were not impressive and felt ripped-off from some other Marvel or Sci-Fi movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I think I can deduce that this is the worst Spider-Man movie I have watched, it really dissapoints at all levels unfortunately. Messy plot, bad acting and crappy visual effects. Please do not watch, in fact do yourself a favor and avoid the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man franchise, both the Tom Holland and the Tobey Maguire franchises are a hell of a lot better than this one in almost every way."

","The film may be too slick for its own good, overcorrecting the earnestness of Raimi's series, but it never poses as anything other than sensory overload. It's a confectionary creation that's likely to drive kids wild, and plenty of adults, too. As an adult, I've rarely fallen victim to my inner 10 year-old, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" consistently broke down the critical barriers that I've honed throughout the years. It's a sugar rush of a film and, quite simply, I liked what it did to my brain. It's often not able to see past its own nose, content to exist forever in the moment, but it's popcorn filmmaking in its purest form, and Marc Webb deserves all the credit in the world for making such a delectable cinematic cake from a line of incongruous ingredients.

","THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 features a very entertaining screenplay interlaced with energetic action sequences, vibrant & astonishing visual effects, epic cinematography apart from an easily likable screenplay. The film doesn't have a convoluted story. It's very neatly executed and the narration is very easy to follow. This film, in short, is a complete treat for any SPIDER-MAN fan.<br/><br/>There's always a lot going on in the film, and the director avoids usage of pointless subplots, which makes each and every sequence integral to the story. There are a lot of touching moments as well. For instance, one brief scene in which Spidey walks along with a young boy is bound to stay with me forever. It made him so lovable and kind that I found it to be one of the best moments in the film. Similarly, the way his web has been shown in slow motion, in one sequence is simply heartwarming.<br/><br/>The action is really entertaining. Every action sequence dazzles, and the sprinkling of CGI on it makes it much more fun. The web-slinging sequences have been shot extremely well. The story is very simple and straightforward. Every single performance is remarkable, especially that of Andrew and Emma, while other actors also put up decent acts. <br/><br/>The final shot is quite energetic and concludes the film on an epic note. Last but not the least, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is simply an entertaining superhero movie which has loads of entertainment and light hearted fun."

","This movie is horrendous! Marc Webb should've done a lot better with this movie because he's a good director, but for whatever reason, he was just sleeping through this terrible movie. I didn't care of the first Amazing Spider-Man but wow, this film makes that film look like The Dark Knight! Everything about this film is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. The is no plot to this movie, just like 9 ministries cobbled together randomly and none of them intertwine or mesh at all. The tone constantly goes back and fourth between loltastic comedy and dark drama/thriller, and it makes no sense. The performances are all dreadful, starting with Jaimie Foxx (yah, a buff black guy as a dweeby nerdy scientist, I bet Vin Diesel was their second choice) and then Dane Dehaan and then Andrew Garfield himself. The music is so damn grating, like whose bright idea was it to put dialog in the musical score...WHILE the characters in the film are talking? There are moments where both the musical score is talking and the characters are talking and they overlap each other. It's awful! Electro is a dumb villain with a dumb motive that isn't even really clear (so, he's made that Spider-Man forgot his name? Now he wants to destroy the world? WHAT?) Rhino is completely wasted (also, Paul Giamatti as a gangster is hilariously bad) and Oscorp has no meaning in the film. The dialogue is horrendous too; half of the lines are said twice in a row for some reason (""I'm going to work, I'm going to work!"") and one of the worst lines ever is when Emma Stone says ""I break up with you"" like a caveman. Spider-Man himself is also extremely annoying. Like the minute long sequence of him arguing with his aunt about...laundry? Oh, and don't forget, this is the ""dark"" and ""serious"" Spider-Man, which is why we have scenes with Parker arguing about laundry or Spider-Man pulling down Rhino's pants...oh yeah, that's dark and gritty all right!

"jordan-maxwell","Null","2","3","22 July 2016"," Amazing? No... But In terms of a No. 2 - Spot On!
","It was a cold February evening back in 2010. I was walking my dogs in the rangers and it was quite a frosty day FYI so the ground was quite damp and wet. Now as I was walking I slipped and as I did I fell into a pile of dog crap. This wasn't some Poodle's doing were talking about, I'm talking Great Dane business. Maybe it was the frost but it was also quite soggy itself. So not a pleasant experience and I had to walk back home smelling of this dog dung, with my dignity and humility gone. <br/><br/>Amazing Spiderman 2 makes that dog crap seem like a Thornton's Chocolate Layer Cake. I mean that with 100% absolute honesty. I just want to say I remember seeing the first Amazing Spiderman thinking this really is as bad as it gets. But boy oh boy did they prove me wrong. <br/><br/>You know how you look at things and think how in God's name did you get there. I call this 'the Trump effect'. Amazing Spiderman 2 epitomises this effect - as I was watching the film I was thinking, how did they manage to raise $200 million dollars to finance this film project and that was the result. $200 million! 200 MILLION! Let that sink in for a moment. that's real money right there spent on the film you have watched. (I would hit myself but I'm saving it for something worthwhile later). <br/><br/>And like Trump, while I sat and watched this film shocked at its absurdity I had to sit there and think this is so ridiculous its sadly become enjoyable. I mean when you jump of a building onto a bicycle with no seat, you can either a) Experience the pain and agony or b) Think 'you know what this is a pretty funny situation.' Perhaps I should start with the beginning.<br/><br/>1)We meet Jamie fox's character. A troubled individual with poor social skills who only wants to be recognised by his Hero Spiderman (I'll give the writers originality points for that). Spiderman saves Jamie and they have a cute bonding session for his birthday. Now we saw the trailer so I know he becomes this 'Electro' character and I was wondering how they were going to pull him off. So I was awe when I realised that the character become Electro by falling into a pool of eels. Now I don't know about you but I know a middle finger when I see one, and Jamie Fox falling into an Eel tank takes the cake. Electro then goes on a mini rampage and Spiderman comes to the rescue but forgets Jamie's character's name. The most obvious human reaction to this event would of course be for Electro to start destroying Time Square with electrical currents and suddenly turning on Spiderman who used to be his long life hero. So lesson number 1, if you ever meet someone emotionally unstable who has accidentally fallen into an eel tank giving the person super human abilities to supply and take in electrical currents. dear god remember their name. <br/><br/>2)Next the side plot Airplane collision scene. The clever writers of this film in their storyboard room decided 'you know what this film needs, a completely unrelated incident were two airplanes are about to collide during Spiderman's big battle with Electro – because you know what we can'. Slaps forehead*. <br/><br/>3)And now Andrew Garfield. Very fitting name for someone who has the acting capability in this film to that of an orange cat. I mean the kid makes me root for the two planes to crash. Also, the actor has as much charisma as a Lidl's Weetabix and the fact he landed this role really sums up the experience. Lesson number 2/ You apparently don't need to act in an acting role. <br/><br/>I could go on ladies and gents but frankly I don't have the time. But in short is the Amazing Spiderman 2 worthwhile? Let me sum that up with a quote from the film.'No'.<br/><br/>No one wanted a new Spiderman reboot. We got one. No one wanted a second sequel of that reboot. We got one. At least now we can know that hopefully the producers have learnt their lesson to maybe leave a longer gap between the original films and a new reboot. <br/><br/>I mean what are they going to do know? Reboot a Reboot? It makes me chuckle just thinking of the ideaoh wait."

I am completely incensed at how Hollywood cannot get it together.

","Although it didn't manage to find its feet until the last act, the amazing Spider-Man 2 is stall a surprisingly good sequel that obliterates the first film. As you can tell I did not enjoy the first film very much I found it a average movie with a horrible villain and a re used narrative. However the second film in the series managed to reassure me that their is stall hope in this franchise. Marc Webb seems to have a better hold on the story he's trying to tell in this film and the relationship between Gwen and Peter is tremendous. Andrew Garfield shows us his acting shops throughout this movie and blows Toby Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker completely away. However the film with all the amazing things it does stall has some flaws. The villain's such as electro and rhino are very cheesy and unconvincingly acted which is very strange due to the actors who are very skilled that portray them. But Dane Dehaan as Harry Osbourne does a brilliant job reassuring his acting ability in Hollywood as he brings a memorable performance to his character. The film also sets up future movies and spinoffs perfectly with a large amount of Easter eggs scattered throughout. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a much better film then the first amazing Spider-Man and packs a huge emotional punch however a stilted narrative and a few wooden characters hold it back from its true potential. Hopefully future spidey films in this universe will solidify Spider-Man as one of the greats."
"edgereviews","9","8","21","23 April 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Review
","Spider-Man has always been my favourite superhero. Ever since a young age I've loved the comics and the Raimi movies were a big part of my childhood. Although I was a big fan of 2012′s 'The Amazing Spider-Man', I'm not afraid to admit it had some serious problems, but for the most part I thought it did a better job with the origin than 2002′s 'Spider-Man' did. This sequel was where director Marc Webb had to really hit the nail on the head though, because Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2′ is one of the best comic book movies ever made. After all of Sony's awful marketing for this movie, I was sceptical, but still very excited. I'm incredible happy to say that my scepticism wasn't necessary, because 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2′ is truly amazing.<br/><br/>The script of this movie is arguably its weakest component, but it's still far from bad. My favourite part of 'The Amazing Spider-Man' was the character development and relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, and this sequel pulls it off perfectly as well. The dialogue between the two feels so incredibly natural, it's like we're seeing an actual relationship folding out on screen. In terms of the story itself, I found it engaging but certain elements often feel fairly contrived and roughly scripted. I found this forgivable however because everything else is so damn good. The movie doesn't suffer from having too many villains (which I feel proves that 'Spider-Man 3′ didn't suffer from too many villains, it suffered from an awful script), as the character of Electro is really good; he's not just a psychopath who wants to destroy the world but instead has believable motives. Harry Osborn is also a well written character, and it's hard to judge the Rhino character because he's in the movie so little. One worry I had was how desperately Sony seemed to want to expand the Spider-Man universe by casting so many well known characters (like Black Cat, Vulture/Menken and Alistair Smythe) for this movie. It turns out it works pretty well, because they aren't any overly obvious references to who these characters will become if you weren't already aware.<br/><br/>The cast do a phenomenal job with their material as well. Andrew Garfield absolutely kills it as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, he's far better than Tobey Maguire and does an excellent job carrying the film. Emma Stone is incredible as well, she and Andrew Garfield have amazing chemistry (probably due to them actually being in a relationship in real life) and seeing the two of them on screen together is an absolute joy. Dane DeHaan is great as he always is, I had worries about him after seeing the trailers but he does really well with the character. Jamie Foxx is a lot of fun to watch, his Electro character is just so amusing to see on screen and he does a good job of making the character a sympathetic villain. Paul Giamatti is also a lot of fun to watch for the few minutes he's on screen, and the rest of the supporting cast was good as well, there were no notable bad performances.<br/><br/>Marc Webb gives wonderful direction in this movie just as he did in the first one. He gives perfect direction on the previously mentioned character scenes in particular, but I also found he seems to have become a much better action director with this sequel as well. Some of the action in this film is truly incredible, a lot of the scenes are very heart pounding and are all wholly entertaining. There is also a phenomenal score to accompany the the action. The VFX in this movie are absolutely beautiful, one of 'The Amazing Spider Man""s biggest problems was its mediocre CGI, but there's no worry of that in this movie because it looks great. This movie feels like a comic book movie. It doesn't go dark and gritty like other superhero movies feel the need to do, and I respect it so much more for that. The colours are bright and gorgeous, and I'm so happy to finally see some good Spidey swinging around the city scenes that are exhilarating and incredible to experience. I'm just so happy after seeing this movie. Is it better than 'Spider-Man 2′? I'm not sure I can decide yet. Having seen 'Spider-Man 2′ countless times I think it would be unfair to compare it to this just yet. 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2′ isn't a perfect movie, but it sure is a hell of a lot of fun."
"joel-waddell64","9","8","21","20 April 2014"," Best Spider-Man movie!
","I grew up reading the spiderman comics, and watching the animated TV show. When the Toby McGuire movies came out, I enjoyed them, but there is much room for improvement.<br/><br/>When the Amazing Spider-Man came out, I saw it in the cinema, and was, once again, impressed, but a little underwhelmed.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 hands down wins the title of the Best Spiderman movie ever made, in my books. It combines great visuals with the classic personality of the Spider-man in the comics, where the older films made him seem too serious and dramatic. It captures the excitement of the Animated Series, and makes many references to other Spider-Man plots, such as Felicia Hardy, Smythe, The Vulture, Doc Oc, and many more. This really appealed to my inner fanboy.<br/><br/>The plot is well constructed and interesting. Rather than focusing on a single linear story about Spidey fighting a villain, this movie is about WHO Spider-Man is, and what he stands for. It explores his personality well, aided by some very emotional and well-delivered scenes throughout.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
"kevinathome","8","10","28","17 May 2014"," Stupid. BUT...!
","Hell, I've seen worse movies than that and watched them a second time.<br/><br/>It had some charms. Granted, there were some stupid bits, but it was flying by so fast I could hardly tell. I liked the wisecracks, found the romance touching, loved the special effects for Electro. Electro's motivation was, I admit, stupid. And I'm not seeing the 'bitten by a radioactive eel' thing. The 3D worked. I finally just forgot about it while it, probably, increased the impact. The way they portrayed the action was effective and creative. The slo- mo and magnifications were mixed in smoothly. The immense time at Gwen's grave-site was corny and childish and stupid. But it is, after all, a Marvel comic, built on melodrama wrought up so large it becomes physical. And the acting/writing choice of making him perky and quippy first time back in the field was stupid. He was weird about giving his blood. And Osborne was inexplicably urgent about a disease that apparently wouldn't kill him till he was what, in his fifties? The rhino suit was cool looking, and I loved the glimpses of suits for Vulture and Dr. Octopus.<br/><br/>I think they should give up on their rule about living in a world of ordinary physics. They don't seem to be able to stick to it anyway. This world should have rare but real magic, like in the Marvel comics. That might work better for Rhino than a suit with inexhaustible ammo and an inexplicable horn. Besides, why armour up a man so big, when a tank already works great?<br/><br/>Electro is pretty tough to justify. We want to personify electricity, so it has to be science-y. I like the new version where he can exist as an invisible field, and pass through wires. So, I'm thinking maybe some science-y blather about figuring out how to store information in electrons for computing, and how they can program it to manipulate the electrons' positions. That kind of breaks the science, so pass over that quickly. So then some desperate scientist stores his own mind in electricity, but it goes horribly awry, driving him insane. He could have some sort of sad quest to re-build his own body. Still, that might be too much power. He could, after all, just lay back and manipulate the energy in a person's brain a little bit to kill them instantly and quietly. Why lob around big blasts?<br/><br/>To be honest, as a story, it is a 6, but the budget, direction, and rarity, raise it up."

"dgrey808","5","1","1","24 May 2020"," The Underwhelming Spiderman: The sequel
","Really not a lot to boast about here. The 5th film in the total movies of its kind really needed to be a fresh take. Unfortunately, a villain who was mistreated his whole life suddenly receiving electrical super powers after a freak accident is just not that. Its not all Jamie Foxx's fault, the script and the character were just not on par.<br/><br/>The acting was similar to the theme of the movie. Andrew Garfield gets a C as the hero himself, Emma Stone gets a B as Gwen Stacy, and Jamie Foxx gets a B- as Max Dillon aka Electro. Performances ranged from average to below average, and again it is not all to the fault of the actors.<br/><br/>Overall, I do not have a lot to say about this film. Nothing stood out, nothing was memorable, and even the action wasn't anything to write home about. There were no attempts at a fresh story line or approach, maybe besides the death of Gwen, but that seemed like a futile desperate reach. The father dying at the end of the first movie and the daughter at the end of the sequel does not bring it home. The thing is, I believe it has a lot to do with the writing of the movie. It didn't give a chance for the actors and director to make something great out of it even if they pointed it in the right direction. Ultimately, I don't think it really would have ever taken flight. We aren't holding Jamie Foxx accountable here though, he did what he could which wasn't much at all."

","1391/5000
Visually grand, with excellent CGI and sound effects, but lacks effective plot and performance-capable characters.<br/><br/>This movie is the sequel to the 2012 movie, once again centered on the figure of Spiderman. Here, young Peter Parker is very torn between Gwen's love and the fear that her action as a punisher might endanger her. Then comes a new super villain (well, the whole story about him really didn't convince me, especially when he hates Spider-Man), and it all happens too fast from there.<br/><br/>As in the first movie, the characters are superficial and the plot is undeveloped. The cast can't shine, because they didn't give you material for it. To some extent, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are saved for their good romantic match. The fast pace of the film and the way events run over allow no developments or delays. The film is clearly focused on the use and abuse of CGI and quality visual and sound features. Undoubtedly, they are remarkable, but they do not justify the film, which is full of dramatic and psychologically profound moments that the plot then completely wastes to the detriment of the action, CGI and show-off, which is really worth seeing. .<br/><br/>Of all the movies about Spider-Man, I think this must be the worst, or one of the worst."
"peewee_catindig","7","1","1","1 September 2019"," Too much villains
","To start it of, the movie had too much villains that we're shown. The main villain Electro had poor motives to actually be an antagonist. Villains like the famous Green Goblin was also shown though lacks screen time; and lastly Rhino, it really did disappoint me when they actually showed Rhino in the trailer knowing that he will actually be one of the villains but then again he was only shown in the last part with actually no action time. Other notable characters were introduce like Felicia Hardy, Alistair Smythe. One good thing to say about the movie though is that the fight scenes were really well thought of. Spider-Man was pretty amazing in terms of it."

There was no need for 3 villains. It seems Sony didn't learn their lesson from the disaster of a film which was Spider-Man 3. The Amazing Spider-Man was near perfect. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 however is just your average Spider-Man movie. Don't expect it to be the best one yet, cause it's not."

It's still an under-cooked and over-produced mess, though, one that is most certainly the result of too many cooks (and super-villains) in the kitchen. There are scenes that provide passing entertainment, the spider-swinging sequences are fantastically realised with honestly some of the best visual effects I've seen, but the feature then gets bogged down in exposition and stupidity as a corporate espionage plot comes into play and then promptly fizzles away, leaving us with nothing but the empty promise of sequels which will now, after this film failed so spectacularly, never see the light of day. 5/10"

","The debate still probably continues as to the necessity of this second trilogy of Spider-Man films so shortly after the first, but to me - based on the first two so far - they are far superior. Sure, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is not as good as its predecessor from two years ago, but it is still very enjoyable. The film does well linking back to the first film, while also laying some back story for the next one.<br/><br/>The storyline starts off quite simple - Peter & Gwen are in still in love, but he's conflicted because of the promise he made to her Dad, so there's a bit of ""will they, won't they?"" But at least we have Garfield & Stone - both just plain better actors than Maguire & Dunst. They introduce Max/Electro (Foxx) quite well, but Harry Osborn (DeHaan) a little less so. And I wish they'd saved the Stan Lee cameo for later on! Still, it's mostly faithful for the comics - with the exception of Giamatti as The Rhino (almost unrecognisable!), although it makes sense he'd be in metal armour, rather than rubber!<br/><br/>I feel they went a little too close to the original trilogy by focusing on Osborn/Green Goblin/Oscorp and not enough on Electro as the main villain & Gwen as the love interest. When you see how powerful Electro becomes (I don't recall him being as strong/capable in the comics), it makes you question why/how Spider-Man would actually be fighting him - seems like a job for the Fantastic Four or The Avengers! It's probably a little too long at 2 hours 20min, but still, there's some rousing speeches (thanks Aunt May & Gwen), some very funny moments and plenty of great action. It just seemed to (please forgive me for this pun) lack a little spark!"

The movie starts off with Gwen at her graduating ceremony waiting for peter while he is fighting the rhino which shows a separation between peter as himself and as spider man. Through out the movie peter feels regret in dating/seeing Gwen due to her father dying and the promise he makes to him (not seeing Gwen) which eventually leads to Gwen's death. The movie has a great love/relationship story between Peter and Gwen/ Peter and Harry. The movies uses shots like point of view and close up views. Although I liked the movies a lot i didn't like the part that Gwen died which brought a depressed mood to the story which could have been the end of Spider-Man."

","Why are detectives so funny to people? Firstly, let me acknowledge that I love Andrew Garfield as Spiderman. Captain America ""Civil War"" was great. <br/><br/>If you're going to do Spiderman, you either have to start small, from his beginnings, and dedicate a whole movie to that, or just make a movie assuming he already holds the mantle of superhero and have him solve a big mystery using his brains. More of Spiderman at the computer if nothing else. <br/><br/>I know this may remind some of the Spiderman and Friends cartoon, so if you're too cool for that I guess, then, well... So what.<br/><br/>This movie did not captivate me or anyone else. Who cares if Andrew Garfield is young. It would be that much more hilarious if he was a well-established superhero in New York City. Then, just when he thinks he has everything figured out, an alien craft is reported over the city. At first the sighting is a joke, but a week later people begin disappearing. Mutilated bodies appear in the streets. A strange creature called Venom is rumored to exist. Spiderman must fight him and then in the end he wins back the black Spidey suit in the most epic thing that has ever happened. Bitchin'."

Harry Osborn as the Green Goblin killed Gwen instead of Norman Osborn even though we saw him at the beginning of the movie which never made sense speaking of the Green Goblin the guy who played Harry in the movie was great as James Franco's successor but he was a miscast as the Green Goblin. But what never made sense was how did Gwen exactly die from falling inside the clock tower when Spiderman caught her in time.<br/><br/>I really wish Marc Webb didn't pull the plug on this movie and have The Amazing Spiderman 3 get canceled.

","Seems this franchise just cannot get it right. Or maybe I just want MY Spiderman to convey a tiny bit of why I loved the comic book so much. This emo, sad, downtrodden Peter Parker with huge hair and no real character just does not cut it for me, nor do the liberties taken with the entire comic book universe. Of course I never liked the ""Ultimates"" versions anyway. Ten years ago, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 was released and quickly became perhaps the most critically acclaimed and popularly beloved comic-book superhero movie since Richard Donner's Superman in 1978. Spider-Man 2 had it all: a great villain in Alfred Molina's multitentacled Doc Octopus, a realistic romantic connection between leads Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, and a script by the Academy Award–winning screenwriter Alvin Sargent that balanced the action and special-effects. Cynical minds and business suits ruined it all.<br/><br/>One of the biggest misfires of this and many other films is the overuse of CGI. Where they could use real, practical stunts and effects, they take the cheap, easy and franky, lazy way out. Time and again the crowd groaned at the terrible effects that would seem bad even on a Playstation 3. The whole thing seems to have been assembled by filmmakers tone-deaf to what constitutes compelling, exciting super hero cinema. Everything the people involved could think of seems to be thrown into the film. It is an overlong mash up of several better films, populated with too many characters and a zillion plots all in a battle to be understood.<br/><br/>In the end, it is time to put this mess to rest. They finally got the suit right... it looks great. The cast tries in vain to save a film that refuses to live. This bad boy is DOA."
"aminil150","1","15","47","19 May 2014"," Just a waste of time....
","If I was to write an essay on how crappy this movie was made, I would have several pages worth of beef to say. I should have spent the time I wasted at the movie writing about how much this movie sucks to spare other people of the bad experience. The first thing I have to say is how lame the villains are. Let's face it, Jamie Foxx is a great actor but a horrible electro. The rhino looked like an over sized pile of crap. I mean even the actor in the suit was a crappy. The villains had no intro whatsoever or no back story that would give them meaning, and make the audience want to feel the villain or why they do what they do. This was the worst marvel movie I have ever seen next to the 2003 hulk. Captain America kicks this movie out of the sea. These producers need to watch the dark knight and understand what they are doing wrong.<br/><br/>When I used to watch the spider man cartoons and read the comics the rhino would stand out as a huge powerful character, not a man in a big metal pile of turd. Also what is up with Gwen Stacy's death. Emma stone was the most suited actor for her role on that film set and she is the one on my books who brought attention to that movie. OK so she dies in the comics but even In the comics she doesn't die that early. Also these marvel movies don't even follow the comics and if they do it is really short. So in turn Gwen didn't have to die. Emma stone was the best actor there, and they just lost her. If the director had any sense instead of spending all that time on Gwen's death, he would make a better fight at the end. I mean this entire movie was et up to show Spider-Man fighting electro and green goblin. The eight minutes that they fought was rushed and lame. Don't get me wrong I like Andrew Garfield, and he plays a great spider man but without Emma in the movie, the series will suck. It's like Sherlock Holmes without Watson. Plus it doesn't help that the chemistry that stone and Garfield has in the movie was great. The chemistry that they showed between the two characters was honestly the best I have seen in a superhero movie. Even In the original comics. Besides The plot sucked. The movie was jumpy and had no feeling to it. The villains chucked, I mean don't even get me started on the Harry they chose. They better bring back Gwen because if I see Shailene Woodley staring as Mary Jane then I will never watch another spider man movie again. I hope the next one features the jackal otherwise sorry marvel, even though I like Spider-man it won't go see any more of his stuff. It seems like marvel only likes to ruin their characters now."

","I didn't find the movie to be as bad as what people are claiming it to be. I watch a lot of movies and I actually enjoyed some comical scenes from Marvel. Jamie Foxx was in a weird role, but I felt like he played it really well. This series is by far above the other Spiderman. So please don't listen to the bad reviews. This movie really isn't that bad, it was more of a fun/action movie.<br/><br/>Also, the love scenes that did show up in the movie were short and to the point. They didn't seem to drag out and get boring. The movie to me also had some twists in the plot.<br/><br/>Thank you"
"Paul1990","7","7","18","22 April 2014"," A really good Spider-Man film
","I really enjoyed this film. The first film came under some criticism especially by lovers of Raimi's trilogy, but I felt it took the necessary steps to redefine the character and it gives the sequel a solid platform to build on.<br/><br/>The casting and performances of both Andrew Garfield as Spider-man and Dane Dahaan as Harry Osbourne are particular triumphs of this instalment. I also think Emma Stone does a good job. <br/><br/>The Action sequences are exciting and are visually spectacular where they particularly succeed in showcasing Spiderman's powers.<br/><br/>I've read some reviews complaining how this film is too much of a romantic flick, but ultimately the relationship between Peter and Gwen is key to the story and adds a much needed dimension to the standard Superhero movie. In fact these interactions between the two characters stand out as some of the best acting performances throughout film.<br/><br/>So overall this is a good watch and I'd definitely recommend anyone to go check it out, my only real problem with it was some of the creative choices surrounding Jamie Foxx's character, especially in his characters normal form.<br/><br/>But other than that go see it!"
"rodrigomarques","6","7","18","18 April 2014"," Often more is worse and this movie was the case, but...
","Spidey is back and ready to show us the potential of their own universe.<br/><br/>The power of OSCORP has been declining due to large-scale accidents related to this. With the death of its CEO, Norman Osborn, is the height of his son, Harry Osborn, taking the reins of the business, but your priorities may jeopardize the company. In trying to find a cure for his condition, Harry uses all the resources of OSCORP to get something that Spider-man has. Meanwhile, Peter Parker discovers what it means to be the friend of the whole neighborhood.<br/><br/>Expectations were very high for this sequel. Once you have done a fantastic job in ""The Amazing Spider-man"", Marc Webb returns to take charge of this new franchise head web, and despite its realization have fulfilled all expectations, the film as a whole left a bit to be desired . This is not just a story of Spider-man, but the door to an expansion of the universe for this character. Many say that ""Iron Man 2"" was like a trailer for ""The Avengers"", this was (partly) a trailer for the movie of the Sinister Six.<br/><br/>The film certainly has a lot more than what is necessary. The opening scene, in which we saw the same opening scene of the previous film but this time from the perspective of the father of Peter, has no impact on history. We have three villains in all, Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino. The first is the main villain of the film. It is one that has a greater presence on the screen and cause more problems to the hero. The Green Goblin, well, not in the movie for only one thing that will not be mentioned. And then we have the Rhino, which has no role in the film is limited to only appear at the beginning and end.<br/><br/>The cast returned to do a fantastic job and greater recognition goes to the new faces. Jamie Foxx stands out first by being concise throughout the film. The other new member that deserves to be recognized is Dane DeHaan for his Harry Osborn / Green Goblin was at least perfect. The work that the actor did with what he was given, was phenomenal. Forget Willem Dafoe and James Franco, if ever there was a good Green Goblin was the DeHaan despite all the problems that caused the plot in character.<br/><br/>The universe of Spider-man is very rich, and often more is worse and this movie was the case. If they had taken things more calmly could have taken the ideas of this film and have done two. What counts is what this is ultimately good save and make us accept his blunders."
"reetarampal68","10","9","25","17 May 2014"," Literally amazing in all aspects!!
","I cant understand why so many reviews were negative... This film was awesome! The CGI was the best in the entire series and the 3D enhances its effect. The villains, especially Electro, were amazing. Electro looks amazing, though his backstory with Max Dillon was very sad and at parts, you feel terribly sorry for him and when he is blown to smithereens in the end, you feel too bad for him because he was just an innocent guy who didn't deserve such a death. Green Goblin was also good, but wasn't given enough screen time. The Rhino was actually bad, because Aleksei Systevich is too loud and seems mad at times. The climax at the clock tower, which has already been revealed as a spoiler in many reviews, can be extremely intense and sad, and shouldn't have been done like that. All in all, I give it a ten, even though it frankly is flawed in many ways, because of its brilliance."
"msjlpalo","10","9","25","4 May 2014"," Amazing Spiderman --- Amazing!!!
","So, speaking truthfully I still can't get the whole movie out of my head.<br/><br/>I've always loved Spiderman, since I was a kid up to now, and once and for all can we just stop comparing the first set of Spiderman to this set? I am just too tired of criticisms. (though I still would've loved it even if Sony would've let go of the rights and give it to Marvel, where it rightfully belongs, then we could see Spiderman together with the Avengers).<br/><br/>ANYWAYS!! I gave this a 10 because I love Spiderman!!! And this is me sending up my gratitude to Marc Webb for trying his best as well as for the realistic chemistry and portrayal of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.<br/><br/>However... Like every other movie, this one has flaws. Electro being a villain is simply has not enough history as to why he became that bad and hateful. Spiderman didn't do anything to him (even saved his life). All I'm saying is maybe it's not enough to want fame and be recognized to be as hateful as Electro. And too much CGI! I didn't even recognized Jamie Foxx in that scenes. Maybe it will be better if they made Jamie Foxx a little recognizable under all that much effects.<br/><br/>Another one is Harry Osborn. He just strutted to the movie. We don't know him and we are not even sure if he walked in at an appropriate time. If they wanted Green Goblin in the movie then they should've took Electro out. That way its all Spiderman vs GG. The timing for Harry's comeback isn't thought of carefully and it felt like it was rushed. They should've included some flashbacks of 10-year-old Peter and Harry so we could see the real connection between the two characters and we ought to know where Harry came from.<br/><br/>This is just my opinion though.<br/><br/>I bawled my eyes because of Gwen's turnout. Oh well, it couldn't be helped because they all focused on ""sticking to the comics"". Maybe they shouldn't have and made their own twists and all that. Either ways, I can't think of watching another sequel of this ""The Amazing Spiderman"" set if Emma Stone is out of the picture. I couldn't even imagine Andrew being paired up with another girl, because Emma portrayed Gwen very well and both of them have this undeniable chemistry that you don't see in any other movie. Pairing Andrew's Spiderman with another character/actress is just GAHHH!!!"
"dylan_jozef","5","9","25","16 April 2014"," Amazing?
","So I just got back from watching The Amz S-M 2, and here are my thoughts. I read many professional reviews off websites and many felt pretty harsh and that had me doubting my opinion; whether I watched a good movie or a bad one. But I think what I saw was pretty good. It's still too early to fully access it and my opinion may change. This movie isn't perfect though, any problems people have with this movie are completely justified but because I love Spider-Man I can looks past that (just). <br/><br/>The first movie was mixed, I didn't feel like re-doing the origin was necessary at all. For me, that's playing it safe. Origins are easy stories to tell and it was already told in the Raimi films. But now that Spider-Man is already established this was going to be the most important film as you get to see whether they can tell a good original story.<br/><br/>One thing they tried with the first film to separate it from the Raimi films was involving Peters parents. But this storyline was never followed through thoroughly. I know they wanted to continue this arc for future sequels but it never felt satisfying enough to me. It felt like a gimmick almost. Now, we get a bit more information regarding the late Parker's, the movie opens with them once again and their presence is felt in a few more scenes. To me it feels like the people working on this movie dug themselves a hole, now that they've mentioned the Parkers in movie one, they've had no choice but to follow through with their story or else the first film with them would've been pointless.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is back as Spider-Man and he's as cocky and overconfident as ever, some people may take that as an unlike-able quality, but I enjoyed him and his performance. So there were three villains this time around, you could say: ""have they not learned from Spider-Man 3"" but if they are building towards having a Sinister Six, do you really want there to be six films for each villain and a seventh for all of them? Audiences need to understand you can't have it both ways. <br/><br/>What did I think of the villains though? Rhino I didn't like, if you have seen the trailers then that's pretty much all the screen time he has. There were a couple action shots and that was it. Paul Giamatti overacted the character and was just plain silly. There was another character in the movie, Dr. Kafka. He was just another complete idiot. I must say, I was impressed with the Rhinos design. When I first saw the poster shot, I was thinking: ""What the f@#k am I looking at? But he translated well and was a faithful adaptation to Bendis and Bagleys Ultimate Rhino which I'm glad they went with, a mainstream Rhino suit would have looked ridiculous. <br/><br/>Electro? He was mixed for me, in the comics he has little depth to his character, so any actor playing him would have been limited to begin with but I thought Foxx was good. Honestly though anyone could have played him. As Max Dillion (Electro's alter ego) Jamie was pretty funny he was different to other incarnations of the character. A lot of people will compare him to the Riddler and Syndrome and that's fair enough. Electro does have the best action scenes they are truly spectacular. But his suit was horrible, it looked like something out of Prometheus. Like Rhino, going mainstream with the suit would have looked silly, but could they have still gotten something fans are familiar with? F@#king hell. Some of the dialogue was pretty cringe-worthy to listen to. I think one line Electro is like: ""It's my birthday, time to light my candles"" or some sh!t. <br/><br/>Lastly was Green Goblin, easily my favourite villain of the three. He was well acted, I'm glad they went with Dehaan. If you've seen him in Chronicle you'll know what I'm talking about. The final confrontation between him and Spider-Man was very intense I could feel my heart beating during those scenes. <br/><br/>I also feel like I also have myself to blame, I watched too much movie footage and spoiled myself. I was over hyped and had unfair expectations invested into the movie. But I am reviewing this as a fan, not some critic who looks at plot devices. So what did I like? Peter and Gwen had great chemistry and there was some spectacular action scenes. What did I hate? Some of the music choices was just... f@#king bizarre, an example of this was during Times Square. Electro's staring at the screens and there is just this dumb stock music playing. I also think Rhino and Electro could have been handled better and the dialogue could have been sharper. <br/><br/>There was some really strange scenes; there was a montage of Spider-Mans heroics. After each battle you see Spider-Man throwing his costume in the closet and one time he's carrying a fish, what the f@#k? It's just a really weird movie sometimes.<br/><br/>Anyway, good movie, I'm giving it ten stars because of how much love Spider-Man even though this movie may really being like a 7-8 (which is still a great score btw.)"
"dshieh","1","13","40","19 August 2014"," An embarrassment to superhero movies
","Let me start off by saying that I *love* superhero movies.<br/><br/>I don't usually write movie reviews, as I figure there are many eloquent reviewers that would do a much better job than I. But, after watching this movie, I feel compelled to warn others.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the *worst* superhero movie I have ever watched, by far. There is no redeeming value to this production, not even the CGI, which is just passable. The writing, the acting, the editing, and the (lack of a) storyline are amateurish. Cringe worthy even.<br/><br/>I want those 142 minutes of my life back. Seriously, this movie is not worth your time."
"ultradragonking25","3","13","40","5 May 2014"," Disappointing
","I'm a big spiderman fan. When I heard that they were bringing electro into the mix I thought there would be a lot of action. There was indeed not. Let's start with the villains. While watching Rhino on the screen who by the way only receives about 4 minutes of the movies time was mocked the whole time and all of his lines felt like they had to voice over his entire scenes like he was speaking in Japanese or something. Then there was Electro which I felt was poorly scripted. He as Max Dillion, came across as a loner which was true, but a crazy one who made up spiderman as a friend having conversations with him in the mirror. It made it almost seem as though electro could have teamed up with him because all he wanted to do was be noticed, but they after one scene completely switched everything around and decided to change the characters personality. The plot with him was far away from the original intent that by the time we reach the end you don't care what happened to him. Then there was Harry, who was Peters best friend. They chose to skip over Norman Osborne all together and give them both a disease. That somehow kills Harry a lot faster than his father and Harry never notices until his father tells him. This sends him on a spiral for survival and doesn't really connect him to becoming the Green goblin except that he injects himself with spider venom and wants spiderman dead because he wouldn't give him his blood to cure him????? It's like you saying hey I want the salt shaker so that I may salt my food so it taste better. Your wife says no, I want you to live longer and not die of heart attack early. You say I'm going to kill you for that. Finally, Gwen's death, he struggles in the whole movie with wanting to keep her alive and finally she dies. I say finally because the issue of letting her die comes up about 20 times in the movie with drawn out dialogue that could have shortened the movie and not made Peter out to be so winy. Her death though was unnecessary I think that they wanted to kill her off to make room for Mary Jane Watson which which makes a small appearance in an email, but they could have just sent her off to oxford and had Peter stay behind, but decided to kill her in a way that made you go really that's it. He caught her and you killed you anyway. I'm sure many may disagree, but this is just how I felt about it. I love Spiderman and it was heart breaking to watch them destroy this movie when it had so much potential."
"wikk-835-204326","2","13","40","4 May 2014"," The Amazingly Terrible Spiderman 2.
","Where to even start...<br/><br/>The product placement in this film was so in my face it took me out of it like...a dozen times. The villain origins are some of the laziest I've ever seen. The Rhino that was advertised like crazy, was in the movie a maximum of three minutes. So if you went to see there Rhino, oops sorry. Electro went from loving Spiderman to hating him in like, a second for absolutely no reason. The movie was two and a half hours long and I felt like tons of it was unnecessary. Shaky-cam was almost constant in the action scenes. Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker get back together and break up so many times it made my head spin. And that's practically the tip of the iceberg on how lazy and bad this film was in the writing department. <br/><br/>Now onto what I liked!<br/><br/>Peter Parker was good."
"marilynpoy","4","6","15","8 May 2014"," This movie is as bad as it is good...
","This movie had the potential to be ""amazing,"" but it wasn't. Before the movie even came out, there have been mixed reviews about it and I can see why. It's not like ""Man of Steel"" where people are split between completely loving it and completely hating it. Instead, we get people saying it's not as good as the Sam Raimi's original ""Spider-man 2."" I think we can all agree that The Amazing Spider-man 2 COULD HAVE BEEN better, especially after ""Captain America 2"" raised the bar so high for what a superhero movie COULD be. <br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is the all-star cast in all of its glory. Andrew Garfield is a wonderful rendition of Spider-man and you can tell he loves embodying the web slinger from start to finish. His emotional range as Peter Parker is shown and there is something that Garfield brings to the table that makes his portrayal of Spider-man more filling than Tobey Maguire. Sally Fields as Aunt May is the embodiment of humanity in itself. The scene where Aunt May is sitting on Peter's bed, telling Peter that he is HER son was heartbreaking and emotional. (Admit it, you got teary-eyed watching that scene.) Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey is what saves this movie and she steals every scene that she is in. Dane DeHaan could have been a brilliant Harry Osborn, but the film was such a mess that it made DeHaan's character debatably ""alright."" Same with Jamie Foxx; Electro could have been an amazing villain, but instead the writers basically stole The Riddler's origin story from ""Batman Forever"" and made him a joke. I didn't buy Paul Giamatti as Rhino at all. I thought he was a miscast and I felt his character was too comical but we'll get into that later. Actually, let's get into it now.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie is essentially what divides the audience into loving the movie or hating it. One guy told me that he really liked the movie because it had the ""80's morning cartoon Spider-man"" feel to it. He liked the comical, goofy side of Spider-man and the villains, I mean after all it is a comic book movie, right? I'm on the other side of the coin where I didn't like the tone of the movie at all. In fact, I hated it. It went from light and comical, to dark and heartbreaking, back to light and comical, and so on and so on. The movie had an identity crisis and it tried so hard to please both the kids and the adults and it ended up being a big confusing mess. Poor Jamie Foxx. His character was in the cross-fire and Electro could have been way cooler but instead we get a guy that is so fascinated by his own reflection on television that as soon as Spider-man steals the spotlight, he snaps and becomes a serial killer. Although it was fantastic to see Electro in action, his character came off cheesy and laughable. And Paul Giamatti as the Rhino was the cheesiest of all. They made the Rhino a joke when he's supposed to be dangerous and a threat.<br/><br/>A great movie has an underscore that heightens emotions without you consciously knowing it. (If you have ever watched a Steven Spielberg movie, you know how powerful music can be.) That being said, right when the movie opens up with Spider-man falling out of the sky, I was instantly taken out of the film. (Sound the trumpets! The hero has arrived!) It didn't feel right, it wasn't subtle. I can't help but compare the score of the movie with Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman 2"", but at least that movie knew what it was doing. Half the time the music for ""Amazing Spider-man 2"" worked, and the other times it didn't. Honestly, did you really like Electro's dubstep theme song in its entirety? I expected more from you, Hans Zimmer! <br/><br/>Now let's get to the best part of the movie, the relationship between Peter and Gwen. Some would argue that they felt the love story was too much and that it distracted from the rest of the film. But I would argue that the love story is THE POINT of this movie. What happens to Gwen is crucial to why Peter Parker is the way that he is; it molded him into how he is today.Throughout this movie we see how much Peter loves Gwen and he proves it by making a choice to stay with her. If the movie gave the couple less screen time, the loss of Gwen wouldn't have been much of an impact at all. If anything her death wasn't rushed, it was the introduction of the Sinister Six that was rushed. Sony was just so hell-bent on starting a franchise that they forced Marc Webb to include things in his movie that was unnecessary. They told the director and the editor exactly what they wanted in the movie, and the crew had to abide by that. <br/><br/>It's such a shame too because Spider-man deserves so much more than that. I'm scared for the franchise. The relationship between Peter and Gwen Stacy is what saved the film, but now that Gwen is gone, what is the future of the franchise going to be like? Gwen was such a likable character and the chemistry between her and Peter was electrifying. Both the actress of Mary Jane and the writers have to prove to us how Peter can emotionally get over Gwen without it being disrespectful and distasteful. And hopefully we'll get more character development from the villains because if it's anything like ""The Amazing Spider-man 2"", I'm not looking forward to the Sinister Six movie at all. <br/><br/>Oh, and can we please stop it with the slo-mo? Not every fighting scene has to be slowed down for us to understand what's going on"
"adityakumarprasad","6","6","15","8 May 2014"," Average. Delivers the expected.
","Yet another Spiderman movie. Yet another super hero movie. Or so I thought but after watching Captain America 2 I had changed my opinion about any superhero movie being yet another boring sequel since Cap America 2 was good. But alas, this came out an average entertainer. Captain America 2 was still much better (as a sequel). <br/><br/>To be frank, with a run time of nearly two and half hours I was very exhausted by the end. Another frank confession is that I liked the Spiderman cast more than the Amazing Spider-man's. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dofoe looked more into the grove. Peter Parker's love for Mary Jane Watson seemed full of chemistry. In comparison, Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spiderman, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and Done Dehaan as Harry Osborn did not really fit their respective roles. I personally felt all of them were not into the role 100%. <br/><br/>Over Amazing Spider-man series I would watch the Spiderman (any 4) movie. Anytime. <br/><br/>Having said that, the Amazing Spider-man 2 had its good parts too. Like the many funny scenes involving Perter Parker and her aunt and Spider- man's talking over phone which stuck on front of a truck. On the emotional scale also it did click at a few places but over-all the story did not feel so convincing to me. The villein (Electro) became a villein of Spider-man out of nowhere or shall I say just because of a small miscommunication. Was not convincing enough to build a full movie with a weak villein. <br/><br/>This movie has come out in 3D as well as 2D. Unlike earlier times I will not ask you to refrain form watching it in 3D. It has its 3D moments, especially when Spider-man jumps around from one building to another. The effects were awesome. But then unlike a movie like Avatar where there is so much to show in 3D, these movies will not aways have incredible scenes to show in 3D for the entire duration. At times I even took off the glasses to ensure I don't get a headache from watching a 3D movie (which makes the print darker). <br/><br/>Another interesting part about this Spider-man movie was that it has a lot of revelations about the past and what really happened to his parents and why really they had to leave a young Peter and moved out for good. <br/><br/>I would recommend you watch this movie without any comparison in mind and you will like it. Don't forget to take the younger generation with you."

The action sequences are fantastic, letting you feel just how powerful Spider-Man is with his uncanny agility. This is what Spidey is supposed to be.

"billygoat1071","6","6","15","2 May 2014"," Aiming For Big
","Apparently, there hasn't been an actual epic Spider-Man movie. The very first one back in 2002 is obviously a humble beginning, the second is more of an existential experiment, the third is basically a series of soap operatic subplots that happens to be a blockbuster, and finally the reboot is a nearly down-to-earth coming-of-age film about an angsty teenager who finds himself as a superhero. In this latest installment, based on the infinite amount of trailers, it is supposed to be the biggest of the bunch. Because sequels are always suppose to be big. But surprisingly, it is not even close to the expected scale. A more appropriate word to describe it is manipulation. The film instead displays itself with serious, challenging conflicts that mostly end up as cliffhangers. They're not bad, it just feels like it cheated the audience for something more.<br/><br/>In spite that it's the longest Spider-Man movie so far, there isn't much big happening on screen. The questions the story asks sure are, but the narrative just juggles off the subplots with contrivance which results as underwhelming. There is no actual straighter point. Stretching it with that runtime just made it kind of exhausting. It also scatters with a lot of potential themes. This is usually the specialty of these movies, no matter how good or weak the movie can be, the central message is always clear, but here the sentiments get a little shakier. The script probably just wants to focus more on the superhero elements, but the plot itself wanted to reserve the bigger action later.<br/><br/>The commitment of director Marc Webb is a huge benefit. Even with all the messy plotting and contrivance, he made those ridiculous turns look pretty natural. The romance between Peter and Gwen is still likable even though it sometimes become more of a priority for Peter than the real threat happening behind Oscorp. The action scenes are also better. The web swinging is a lot breathtaking and the fight scenes are surprisingly compelling. People might be focusing on the special effects and the cool slow-mos, but those aren't the real merits. Instead of long shots of massive explosions, it mostly concerns the normal citizens in danger, making the fights look more than personal. It's no groundbreaker to the genre of course, but at one point when some of them are about to die, it does feel like a big deal.<br/><br/>The acting of the returning actors from the last one didn't change a bit, which is good. The new ones are fine. Jamie Foxx is fair as Electro, but the alter ego is what handicaps. Max Dillon appears to be a sociopath and that should make him terrifying, but instead he acts more like a buffoon. Better is Dane DeHaan, though the script disappointingly rushed the character to the dark side, but the actor balances Harry Osborn's both human and sinister personalities quite well. And in one killer scene of the uncredited appearance of Chris Cooper indicates that the movie should be ashamed for not giving him more screen time as Norman Osborn.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not yet the most epic Spider-Man ever. It's basically a busy sequel that hardly been anywhere, but even with all the pretentiousness of the story, the film can still provide genuine emotion and fortitude behind the action, the obvious dramas, and even in its most bombastic cliffhanger. The real letdown is it fails to promise the real deal, but even if it has a lot of action, the problems of the story are still too noticeable. The direction and acting are once again competent, the plot just needs consistency."
"blade399","7","6","15","17 April 2014"," Still Has Potential, But Lacks A Push
","The Amazing Spider Man (the questionable reboot to Sam Raimi's trilogy) is merely the beginning to this messy plot-fest that is The Amazing Spider Man franchise.<br/><br/>The sequel is a good film. However, the messy plot continues with Peters search for answers about his parents. It feels like they're making mountains for the sake of being complicated and to add depth, which feels unnecessary and a bit too forced. Maybe by the end of the franchise it will all add up, but for now it only acts as a pointless pendulum for Peters emotions.<br/><br/>But that's not what I want to focus on, my main focus is the villains. After Spider-Man 3 I've found any film that tries to handle more than 1 villain to fall short, and TASM2 does just that. Electro was rushed and not really explained, with a weak motive to carry him forward. His transformation to villain (a tub of eels) was pretty underwhelming too and the way his power works was inconsistent. One second he doesn't know how it works, the next he's flying. One second he's electrical, the next he's wearing a body suit. These inconsistencies only add to the frustration of not getting a villain who actually does ANYTHING. Electro is there for one second and gone next. There's no jeopardy in this movie until the finale, which brings me to the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Dane Dehaan was brilliant in the role of Harry (probably nudging James Franco) but is again wasted. This is the problem with trying to develop two major villains in such a short space of time. They're underdeveloped and rushed, leading you to really question their motifs. You don't care for these villains, they simply become a hindrance. <br/><br/>With such brilliant actors and performances I feel the biggest let down in this movie is what every super-hero movie is defined by, the enemy. Having recently come off The Winters Soldier, I can't help but be majorly disappointed with Electro and Goblin (thankfully we'll see more of the latter).<br/><br/>The entirety of the film can be summed up in one sentence 'Peter Parker doesn't know if he wants to be Spider-Man or stay with Gwen, but due to the fact she died he's inspired to carry on saving people'. That's high-concept movie making in a nutshell. It's a shame really, because had they just used one villain and put them consistently against Spider-Man within the movie, it would have been a better film.<br/><br/>Which brings me back full circle. Sam Raimi. The entire plot is drawn straight out of his sequel to Spider-Man (with Peter Parker questioning his obligation to do it or to stay with his girl). Gwen Stacey dying was the catalyst I think this franchise needed to really push on. But Marc Webb needs to learn to not go bigger, just go better. Unfortunately I don't see that happening, with a Sinister SIx movie just round the corner.<br/><br/>All this franchise needs is one entry, with ONE villain more grounded and understandable than that of Lizard. A villain who truly hates Spider-Man for reasons not forced but developed for us to see. A movie where Spider-Man is under constant threat, both as Peter and his alter-ego, by this force of evil. This is something we haven't seen this the Green Goblin and Doc Oc, from the previous Spider-Man films.<br/><br/>It's all there to be explored. The potential is trying to seep through but is trapped behind the compulsive need Hollywood has to stick a dynamite and blow-up the movie for a spectacle. By taking a leaf out of Mr Raimi's book, (or even Mr Nolans 'Dark Knight' trilogy)... Heck, even The Winters Soldier! We may see an 'Amazing Spider-Man' film with consistency, depth and a villain to go up against Spider-Man, that will truly make us fear for his life."
"corymauricejohnson","1","8","22","16 January 2016"," Terrible
","I still haven't recovered from how bad this movie was, and it's been 18 months. If somebody tries to show you even a small snippet of this train wreck, immediately leave the room or physically stop them, if needed. Everything about this movie is lazy, this review probably took more time to make than the script. The main villain's motivation for becoming evil is because Spider Man didn't remember his name, are you serious? The romance in this movie fits in so awkwardly with the other scenes. They should've made a fun adventure Spider Man movie and a sappy romance, instead of horribly combining the two. The product placement®(Sony) would be glaring for anyone not accustomed to it getting shoved down their throat at every movie, like we all are. Mary Jane or whatever her name is, dies near the end of the movie in a horrible cliché scene that made me burst out laughing. After that, Rhino makes a brief appearance and then the movie ends exactly the same as the trailer did. The whole point of a trailer is to provide anticipation for things that will get resolved in the movie that they want to sell to you, but they just cheap'd out and decided to not even film that scene. But don't worry, it'll all be in the next movie!"

","Needlessly dark. Not fun. Not for kids. Don't waste your time. Made my son cry and left the rest of the family bitter and angry. Not to mention that the Rhino character is deplorably awful. This could have been a good film. Jamie Foxe's Electro was great (although the way he became Electro was rather cheesy), the charisma between Spidey and Gwen is great, and Harry is fantastic. However, as mentioned above it was needlessly dark and depressing. I don't know how Spiderman will get through the suffering without some serious psychological counseling. Maybe they'll just have him off himself in the next film. That would certainly be in keeping with the spirit of this movie."
"adamskidsouza","3","13","41","26 April 2014"," I want more of Rhino!
","I will start by saying that this series so far is inferior in almost all areas in comparison to Sam Raimi's trilogy. I have found this more annoying than entertaining and Maguire's Spidey was more like-able (in my opinion). I will start with the bad points regarding this film as there are more of them and together they create an appalling sequel.<br/><br/>CONS: <br/><br/><ul><li>Backstory: As the film opens we get an explanation surrounding Peter's parents, their deaths and the Oscorp conspiracy. Although this was needed and I was glad to see it, I feel it perhaps came a movie too late and should have been covered in the first movie and put aside. Despite it being out of place, it was disappointing to find that this explanation was one of the better scenes in the film as it had one of the best action scenes and wasn't boring me. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Andrew Garfield: His Spiderman still is yet to grow on me as his arrogance never ceases to annoy me. As he arrives at the graduation and walks on stage as Gwen is speaking and starts kissing her just seems ""Un-Spiderman like"" as he should be allowing her to speak. Also his cockiness with the thugs early on in the film, joking around whilst in the midst of a dangerous police chase was just not on. Also, this rendition of Spidey is more of a ""look at me, look at me as I do this!"" rather than the Spiderman that gets the job done who has his mind set on making sure that no one is hurt in the process. At the beginning of this film, there is a huge car crash at a four-way junction and not once does he make sure no one gets hurt.. His ideology should be more like Raimi's and Batman's where he does everything to protect and never kills people otherwise he will become like the people he thwarts. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Promotion: The advertising for this film led us to believe the danger for Spiderman would be much greater than it actually turned out to be. On posters, there was the subtitle ""Electro Rises"" suggesting he would be a real threat in the NEXT movie. That could still happen in some strange twist, but that would annoy me even more. I was looking forward to the scenes featuring Rhino as I enjoyed him in the comics and we got a glimpse of him in the trailers, suggesting he would play a greater role but was only featured at the very end as Spidey makes his return. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The chemistry between Peter and Harry was NOTHING like it was in Raimi's films, in those their friendship was established immediately and was fun. You could tell they were best friends. In this however, they seemed distant, doubtful, plus their entire friendship seemed as it it had been quickly cobbled together. Not good. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jamie Foxx was COMPLETELY wasted in this film: His character starts out as a lonely man that goes ignored by everyone, and Foxx portrays this character well! The plot then changes him from a obsessed Spiderman fan (good acting) into a vengeful weirdo (not so good..). The entire premise of his change in attitude is confusing as well, as it seems as if someone flicked a switch and he had SUDDENLY changed his views on Spidey.. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The length is just diabolical: There is so much unnecessary dialogue (especially surrounding Gwen and Peter's subplot about moving to England) that, if not included, would have made it slightly less painful to sit through. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Plot goofs: Towards the end of the film as Gwen is falling to her demise, Peter shoots his web towards her in a final effort to catch her. It goes into a slow- motion cut as the web stream weaves through the obstacles and ultimately forms the symbolic shape of a hand to grab Gwen. If (like Raimi's Spidey) the web came from Peter himself, this COULD be understandable as his emotions could be in some way tied to his web. But this Peter uses his own custom built devices to shoot his web (One of the most disappointing things about this rendition of Spiderman by the way) so how come this one time, when it suited the plot, it does this? </li></ul><br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/><ul><li>The CGI is so good!!! I'm not going to lie, the CGI in this film is breathtaking and the special effects throughout look incredible, the production team have done a great job of making the film LOOK good (If only they'd spent more time on the plot, character development, length and almost everything else...) They really do make for a good viewing experience and paired with good writers good make a really decent film. - Chemistry: Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are an exceptional pair in this film. Obviously, Garfield's character is doing what he does to protect his girlfriend (and so on) but both of their responses seemed genuine and 'un-generic'. Also, at the end of the film as Gwen dies in his arms, Garfield's acting is truly top-notch as you can really sense the emotion. Throughout this film, you really get a feel of how much Peter is in love with Gwen which is a sign of good acting.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Emma Stone: Her character is seriously sassy, feisty and of course makes for serious eye candy throughout. Major praise to the casting team!</li></ul><br/><br/>To conclude, I think this a definite improvement over the first film in this series but is still tedious to watch and did not entertain me. Needless to say, I'm not looking forward to the trilogy's finale."

"krenwregget","4","5","12","4 September 2014"," how do I say this.... terrible?
","Where do I even begin? This movie is a complete mess from start to finish and contains too many problems to list.<br/><br/>What's shocking is that several people read the script and then said, ""yeah, this seems like a good idea."" There are massive continuity problems, a nonsensical story, a laughable villain (actually more than one), bad acting, atrocious (that means really bad, kids) writing, groan-inducing dialog and relies on so many coincidences to push the story forward that it baffles the brain. In fact, the whole thing is an insult to anyone with a triple-digit IQ.<br/><br/>I actually find it shocking that anyone could rate this film higher than a 6; I'm hoping those are all 13 year old boys who don't know any better. If you enjoyed this films and aren't 13, schedule yourself for an MRI immediately as you have suffered a recent brain injury.<br/><br/>The first ""Amazing SpiderMan"" was utterly forgettable. Unfortunately, I'll remember this one for a long time because it was so terrible."

"michael-klein-1982","4","5","12","8 August 2014"," surprised at the score
","OK, stream of consciousness on my part. Sorry for the lack of proper structure, but I just saw the movie and this one has to get out of my system. Usually I find the ratings on the IMDb website helpful - in 9 of 10 movies i would have given a similar score. Not this time. I might be biased because i like the comics but even if i try to keep this out of my review, I still think it is a terrible movie. I found the actors little convincing in their portrayal of the characters; it might have been the fault of the directors for not writing them properly. Don't know. Andrew Garfield is constantly twitching nervously and is trying too hard to be a nervous unattractive nerd. And the slapstick humor in some scenes is just annoying. The movie couldn't hold my attention for more than the first 30 minutes, maybe less. That's when I started to look at my watch and wonder how much longer this is going to take. Overall the characters are one-dimensional, spider-man isn't funny, unless you are 6 years old, aunt may is your stereotypical worrier, Gwen Stacy - ""oh, the super villain with mega electro powers is going to fight you in a battle to the death? - I'll tag along, OK?!?!"", harry Osborne - hair cut is already hinting at his abysmal decline to a bad guy (which is put so poorly on the screen that I had to laugh - his appearance seemed so awfully forced...), electro - suddenly he wants to kill spider-man even though 5 minutes earlier he was his buddy for life, not convincing at all. But the highlight came at the end - Rhino - wtf!!!! that dropped the rating another 2 points down the ladder - that was just the highlight of terrible ideas. The action sequences were nice - no complaints there. You could clearly see that this movie aims at a younger audience. No comparison to the first 3 movies where Sam Raimi was responsible for the franchise. Tobey Maguire was also a much better match for Peter Parker as an insecure teenager. Even though the reboot of the franchise is supposed to be darker than the first trilogy. To sum it up - one of the worst ""mainstream"" marvel films. Comparable in my eyes to Daredevil or Ghost Rider. Again, sorry for the poor structure and the mistakes - like i said stream of consciousness."
"Rickting","5","5","12","25 July 2014"," The not very amazing spider-man
","In general I like superhero films. I have little patience for boring love stories and cartoony villains, but usually these films have some good story and fun spectacle. The first 2 Spiderman movies were excellent and the third isn't even as bad as you remember. So why reboot? What could possibly be the point? Why do these movies even exist? They're about as necessary as the upcoming Paul Blart Mall Cop 2. However, these movies are here and there's nothing we can do about it. The first was a poor reboot that didn't follow the original as closely as people say it does, but is bad because it's not a good comic book movie in general. This sequel is a slight improvement. For some reason, they decided to do the Spiderman 3 formula and have Peter Parker juggle battling a multitude of underdeveloped villains while sorting out his personal life. The truth is, TASM 2 isn't really a movie. It's a compilation of advertisements for upcoming cash grabs which just sets up sequels and spin offs.<br/><br/>The story is overlong and lacks emotional depth, the script is underdone and the film feels totally unfocused and overstuffed. Andrew Garfield is a bad Spiderman who cowers in Tobey Maguire's shadow; Jamie Foxx is weak as Electro but Emma Stone plays the definitive comic book movie girlfriend and Dane DeHaan is excellent as well. Few can argue that Peter and Gwen's relationship was spot on. As well as that, Marc Webb (Probably hired just because of his name) is a pretty strong director and the action scenes are visually stunning and often fairly exhilarating. You also feel like you're swinging through the air with Spiderman. Therefore, despite the weak narrative there's always fun to be had with the set pieces, which thankfully don't disappoint. Gwen Stacy's death, though spoiled by the internet and trailers, was still a powerful moment and far better handled than most of the film. TASM 2 is a weak albeit watchable comic book sequel that boasts some neat touches but it's totally overloaded. Maybe it's time to leave Spiderman alone for a while.<br/><br/>5/10"
"paul_haakonsen","4","5","12","17 July 2014"," This wasn't really impressive...
","I can't really claim to be fan of the superhero genre, and this who reboot thing with ""Spiderman"" didn't sit well with from from the previous movie, and it was with some reluctance that I sat down to watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"".<br/><br/>This is first and foremost an effects movie, as the CGI overshadows the rest of the movie, especially with its lukewarm storyline.<br/><br/>The villains in the movie were almost non-existing, and what little on-screen time they had, they were far from being utilized to the fullest of their potential. And that made for a somewhat below average experience, because these villains could have added so much more to the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't get that whole fake teeth thing that was going on with the Max Dillon character, especially when you could see Jamie Foxx's real teeth through the fake teeth in the upper mouth. It was just horrible to witness.<br/><br/>And one thing that also made this movie less than mediocre for me was the usage of comedy throughout the movie. It was just so misplaced and it didn't work out at all with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Truth be told, then Tobey Maguire actually pulled off the spider-man character better than this new guy in these two movies, Andrew Garfield.<br/><br/>Well, I have seen it now, and thus can scratch it off the ""not watched yet"" list. And I can honestly say that I will not be making a return trip to this particular movie."

","(NO SPOILERS WILL BE IN THIS REVIEW)<br/><br/>I went into this movie with such high hopes for a number of reasons. one is because i thought that the first amazing spider-man movie was a great reboot. although i still do like the Sam Raimi spider-man movies but i felt that the first amazing spider man told Peter Parkers story much better and that Andrew Garfield was a better Peter Parker.<br/><br/>i think my main problem with this movie is that it is hardly it's own movie it relied way to much on build up for the sequels rather than the premise of it's own movie that this film is starving for. a lot of peoples worries in this movie was that there were to many villains but honestly you don't need to worry about that. <br/><br/>i think the weakness of this reboot is probably the villains. the first amazing spider-man movie had lizard who by the end of the movie wasn't even that memorable he just seemed like that big cliché of a superhero movie and that is what electro is in the amazing spider-man 2. i won't talk much more about electro because that will be in a different review. the peter parker and Gwen Stacey story line is really good because the relationship that they have is in a word, sweet, shall we say and the conflict that starts going on between them is overly realistic but with what's happening, their story line keeps jumping back and forth to the point that it starts to annoy you. Jamie Foxx as electro was really really good but the biggest let down was that even though he is the villain mostly seen in the movie, he is not the main villain.<br/><br/>i didn't expect this movie to be fantastic but i didn't expect it to be as bad as it was."
"xmichaelraine","6","5","12","5 May 2014"," Amazing? Not quite
","Especially if compared to it's most recent predecessor in the Marvel realm, Captain America 2, this one falls very short of meeting its bold title. A noble attempt none the less. This film is an upgrade over 2012's ""The Amazing Spiderman"" which I found mind numbingly boring. There's definite improvements as well from the Sam Raimi ""Spiderman Trilogy"". All in all though, the biggest fault lies in the words on the page. The Amazing Spiderman 2 wields superior special effects, and a gushy on screen romance; However it tries to tell far too much at once, never getting a grasp on the fine details of the seemingly endless subplots.<br/><br/>The most painstaking thing about this film for me, is that watching it I realized I had seriously already seen 80% of the key plots points in the trailers for the film. It's no surprise though seeing as how Sony released some 4 full length trailers, and then who knows how many teasers. What's even more frustrating, is that some really interesting story elements from the trailers weren't even in the film! What's happening here? There's a whole mini clip in the trailers where Harry Osborn reveals to Peter that Oscorp has had him under surveillance for some time now. And it's never in the movie. Not a single reference to it. This is a blockbuster trend I despise. LEAVE THINGS TO BE DISCOVERED. I don't want to know what's going to happen next! And I knew what was going to happen next throughout 2/3 of this film.<br/><br/>I'm making it sound like I absolutely despised this movie, but I promise I didn't. It's just not near as 'amazing' as it wants to be. It's astonishingly ordinary. I mean yeah the special effects and CGI are top rate, but so what? Impressive CGI is dime a dozen these days. The strongest arm the film has is the love story. It totally makes sense that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are a couple in real life, because they really do have undeniable chemistry on screen. You do care about their relationship.<br/><br/>With a totally constipated plot, an overlong runtime, and payoffs that just aren't good enough it's a shame to say that we have yet another underwhelming Spidey film. There's probably enough here to keep the young ones engaged, but for me it's just more of the same. There hasn't been a really well done Spiderman film since 2004, and even that one had it's flaws. And with an already confirmed third installment in this series, as well as a ""Sinister Six"" spin off, there's definitely opportunity to improve; but I won't be holding my breath."

Next they aren't talking about villains unite int his movie they are talking about the setup for the sinister six in the next movie.

","Certifiably rotten, huh?<br/><br/>I politely disagree.<br/><br/>Like the phrase dictates: 'It takes a big man to admit he's wrong.'<br/><br/>Well, I'm not large in stature. So imagine the superhuman integrity it takes for me to say:<br/><br/>I was incorrect, ladies and gentlemen.<br/><br/>But only partially. <br/><br/>(Check out my review of The Amazing Spider-Man to see why. It's factually accurate, but my skepticisms surrounding a series reboot come across too boldly.)<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a fantastic movie, particularly as it pertains to the superhero genre.<br/><br/>Frankly I'm surprised the movie's been received unfavorably by critics. After rifling through several reviews, I find few criticisms worthy of contention. I suppose, ultimately, the appreciation is very subjective.<br/><br/>In my review of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire I put forward a thesis about what makes a sequel 'great.' I reworked it for the purposes of this review.<br/><br/>A great sequel furthers and expands the central narrative. It introduces relevant new elements offering alternative perspectives resonating within thematic ideas established by the previous film; all while maintaining suspenseful thrills and compelling character interactions. Finally, it evolves the conflict, and (in the case of a multi-part series) offers an emotional bridge tethering us from one film to the next.<br/><br/>Therefore, in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker (played by Andrew Garfield) is overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Garfield is an excellent web-slinger, he ratchets up the witty banter in the second installment and is quite lovable as the protagonist. Peter's relationship with Gwen (played by Emma Stone) is cute, relatable and touching.<br/><br/>The more (for lack of a better word) 'romantic' parts are fast paced and riveting. So the movie doesn't get mired in lovey-dovey gobbledy gook.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro is a highly sympathetic character. Which works great for a supervillain! We feel for his desire for verification, his dreams of celebrity and notions of grandiosity.<br/><br/>Speaking of well-written supervillains, one of the best parts of the movie is when the bad guys conspire. It's a believable scene, justifying an evil alliance, and it's an aspect of cinematic superhero stories that's never executed properly.<br/><br/>Dane DeHaan is solid as Harry Osborn, especially in the form of the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>The primary complaints are an unfocused narrative, an overabundance of characters and an overly action-packed final battle scene. These are all generalized, subjective criticisms and I couldn't disagree more.<br/><br/>One review compares the final fight scene to the destructive culmination of Man of Steel. I found the criticism absurd when people were 'shocked' by the chaotic final battle sequence in last year's reboot of Superman. And I still think it's ridiculous to criticize a superhero film for being 'overly destructive.'<br/><br/>We're dealing with superhuman beings here, folks; if we're to accept this reality then buildings must tumble.<br/><br/>There are two points of contention worth discussing: Paul Giamatti's character (Aleksei Sytsevich) and the needless scene where the airplanes avoid collision.<br/><br/>Beginning with the former, this is Giamatti's worst role ever. For whatever reason, his character feels very artificial, primarily because we can't understand his dialogue. The film also doesn't explore his background; probably a contributing factor to the 'overabundance of characters.'<br/><br/>As for the latter point, there's a scene in which the city's power becomes compromised. A slew of minor characters are introduced for a brief sequence. Basically, these scenes illustrate the potential problems resulting from losing electricity. The air traffic control team waits for the power to turn on so they can warn two planes of imminent collision.<br/><br/>The sequence isn't pointless; they're trying to show us something. But why wasn't it removed from the final cut? It's ultimately a major derailment that doesn't justifiably build on the story.<br/><br/>I have one final thing to mention, but can't do it without spoiling something major. If you haven't seen The Amazing Spider-Man 2 yet, stop reading here.<br/><br/>Lastly, the confusion surrounding Aunt May's role is worthy of note. Post-viewing, my buddy mentioned being bored by the interactions between Peter Parker and his aunt (played by Sally Field.)<br/><br/>Whether you appreciate it or not; the filmmakers are establishing a contrast between Aunt May and Gwen Stacy. This dichotomy illustrates a correlation to Peter. The knowledge of his alter ego seems to place his loved ones in danger.<br/><br/>When Peter and Aunt May are interacting, he's attempting to keep one variable in his experiment constant. Towards the end of the movie, his hypothesis is proved, and the way to move forward is clear. By refusing verification, he can protect Aunt May from the dangers of his other life.<br/><br/>I'm trying to be careful about spoiling a plot point I consider crucial, but will conclude with the following remark.<br/><br/>Your appreciation of this movie will depend much, it seems, on your willingness to engage with the narrative. If you're a superhero/Spidey fan, you're bound to enjoy this movie, even if you don't love it as much as me.<br/><br/>Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an innovative and original flick, with a polished narrative that takes chances and attempts to illustrate aspects of superhero stories we're unfamiliar with.<br/><br/>Good on you, director Marc Webb, for throwing together a sequel worthy of a trip to the theater."

","I don't know why this movie is getting so much hate, I thought it was the best spider-man movie yet. The CGI was amazing, so was the action and the emotion of each of the characters. The only negative thing I found was that toward the end, when the green goblin is fighting Spiderman, he was taken out too fast. The fight was perhaps five minutes and that was it. I understand they set him up for the next movie, but he should of gotten more screen time. Other than that, the movie was really good and entertaining and I would highly recommend it. I thought Dehaan and Stone were the one's who stood out the most in their roles, although the rest of the cast did a great job as well. I think that any spider-man fan will see it, especially since it's very similar to the comics."

","As far as sequels go, TASM 2 does everything a good sequel should do, which is further the story, up its game in terms of both action and drama (depending on the film), and leave its audience satisfied and longing for the third film coming down the road.<br/><br/>I went with a few friends to see this film, and everyone had their own opinion that they shared once it was over. Taking in the negative and positive comments about it, everyone still had an overall good outlook on how this turned out. It definitely surpassed the first on every level in my book.<br/><br/>The story, even deeper than I expected, and it was very interesting to see how Peter's (Andrew Garfield) parents played a vital and tragic role of who he is and the company known as Oscorp. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is back as one of my favorite love interests for a superhero film: very smart, beautiful, emotional and even though she gets in danger, she does her very best to help out in a important way. I don't want to spoil anything, but it keeps your attention, you care for the characters, and by the end of the film you are both left with a sad feeling of loss, as well as triumphant when you see your favorite web-slinger return to fight the evils of NYC.<br/><br/>The action is very cool, and Spider-Man's costume is so awesome looking. From incredibly immersive scenes of swinging around the city with Spidey (which looks amazing in 3D at times), to him entangling in intense battles with a powerful Electro, or a very menacing Green Goblin (sorry William Dafoe, this one works better).<br/><br/>A lot of people were worried about 3 villains being in this film, and how much of a problem it was in the winy ""Toby-Spidey"" Spider-Man 3. No worry, the film balances this out quite nicely. The main villain for certain is Electro (performed very well by Jamie Foxx), and his journey from a slightly off the edge Spider-Man fan boy with no friends into a dark and electricity leeching monster. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) plays a pivotal role in Spider-Man's life story, especially at the very end of the film when he finally becomes Green Goblin. Rhino (I love Paul Giamatti) is in the film at the very beginning and very end, and leaves you wanting so much more from his psychotic and hilarious performance, and his bada$$ Rhino suit.<br/><br/>All in all, fans of Spider-Man and anybody who has seen the first TASM should definitely see this movie. It exceeds its predecessor, and leaves you yearning for more. Can't wait for TASM 3! 9/10"
"howardo1","7","7","19","16 April 2014"," Ticking over the trilogy clock.
","The first Amazing Spider-Man film gave off a unique vibe- It had the look and feel of an indie film, but, could boast a huge marketing campaign, star-studded cast, and healthy budget. And, on top of that, It was a great film; brilliantly acted, choreographed, and a solid, If sometimes typical superhero motif, the question on everybody's mind is, Is the second one, which sees people of all ages flooding into cinemas worldwide, just as good? <br/><br/>Well, here's the short answer; No. Why? This film suffers from a phenomenon that many before It have. It's the second film In the franchise. And, the inborn issue with this Is the fact that It doesn't feel as fresh, new, and exciting as the first, and, the story won't do anything too bold. The second film has to play It safe, else It risks overshadowing the climactic third. The amazing Spider-Man 2 doesn't stray from the superhero film comfort zone, as to give Itself breathing space for the third to blow our minds.<br/><br/>So, what If we talk about the film whilst disregarding the fact It's an integral piece of a franchise? Well, It's a great film In that sense. We pick up during Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) renaissance, he's never been In better form as a vigilante, has a trophy girlfriend, and has started working his way into Photography. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) Is Peter's aforementioned trophy girlfriend, and, a huge plus point to this franchise, and this film In particular is the chemistry between the two leads. The fact Garfield and Stone are real-life sweethearts really adds that extra bit of kick to the emotional side of Gwen and Peter's relationship. <br/><br/>Another thing this film does really well Is this idea of Peter Parker is our main man, It's just dumb luck that he's Spider-Man. Despite the film being called Spider-Man, It never real feels like that's all the film Is about- we're watching a young man trying to pave his way In life, and all the highs and lows that come with being the Spider-Man are just supplementary to that. Superhero films can sometimes fail to feel like a story of human struggle, and, this Is, for me, the most impressive thing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2. <br/><br/>However, Garfield and Stone aren't the ones to steal the show here. Oh no. Jaime Foxx appears as Max Dillon, soon to be known as ""Electro"", and literally lights up the screen In every scene he appears In. The meek and powerless Max, after suffering an accident at Oscorp (Go figure), gains the ability to control, emit, and even turn into purplish-blue electrical bolts. There is something so unnerving about Foxx's performance. He's not a sadist, he's not insane, he's just really, really upset with life. He isn't like The Lizard, a massive, muscle-y menace. He is far more terrifying, and far more interesting. <br/><br/>So, what doesn't this film do well? Well, nothing, really. But, when you take Into consideration the fact that the only real role of this film Is to develop Spider-Man a little bit more, and whet our appetites for the next instalment, this film just doesn't do anything bold, or utterly unforgettable. I recall the scene in The Amazing Spider-Man 1 where the cranes line up, so Spidey can get to Oscorp in time, as being one of the most poetic and beautiful scenes in Superhero film history- but, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 just doesn't have that flavour, that poetic feel, It's done In a very, very safe fashion, and It feels like It's just ticking over the clock until the third one comes out, and does something truly, Amazing."

""Gwen saves Spider-Man more (often), than he saves her. Gwen's incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... ""<br/><br/>You are so constantly and consistently entertained that you fail to realize that this SPIDERMAN sequel has just flown by, despite the longest running time of 142 minutes. Spider-Man must yet again protect New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten NYC. This time there are real deep and meaningful emotional challenges, seen in the on- screen romance between Andrew Garfield (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy). Despite being a Computer Graphics driven movie, it was filmed entirely in New York USA, and now is the largest film production ever shot in New York and New York City. USA MPAA Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action/violence. <br/><br/>You must see the 3D cinema version, but visually even better when experienced in the IMAX 3D version. The director has very deliberately adjusted the focus, so that you concentrate only on the one part of the screen important to progressing the storyline.

Directed by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz, Colm Feore, Paul Giamatti, Sally Field. <br/><br/>SONY PICTURES for the character of Gwen Stacy, has re-interpreted and deviated from the source material.

This was a trip inside a very bad trip. Spider-Man deserved better care, more dedication & definitely more respect towards the audience that spends time & money with high expectations to finally see one of our dearest Superhero on the big screen.

","this is the best spider-man movie I have seen yet. I thought that this movie would end up like an atrocity like spider-man 3, but I was wrong. This movie is amazing (no pun intended).The cast is pitch perfect, the action is stunning, the plot is complex and interesting, and it is beautifully sad. When Gwen died it made me feel really cold and ill. It was so sudden and painful looking. And Andrew Garfield's performance when he started crying made me cry as well. The villains were handled well, and they were all connected. You really felt bad for electro, and believe it or not I actually started rooting for him during the Times Square sequence. He didn't flip out at spider-man because spider-man forgot his name, he flipped out because he thought spider-man, his ""best friend"" betrayed him by telling the cops to shoot at him to make electro mad so spider-man could fight him and make himself look good in front of everyone. It made perfect sense. ""You're so selfish, you set me up. You lied to me."" And you can already tell electro has some mental issues, plus the fact that he's been ignored and bullied his whole life, and he just got crazy powers that he can't control yet and everyone is shooting him because of it. Harry Osborn was very good, and Dane is an amazing actor. His becoming of the green goblin was well played out, I just wish Sony had kept the goblin a secret, they showed him way too much in the trailers. Imagine how awesome it would have been to find out green goblin was in the movie while watching it in theaters. My mind would have been blown, but what I got instead was awesome nonetheless."

I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I would bet my money on a third installment.<br/><br/>This movie defied all odds against the original 2nd movie – no thanks goes to Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Alfred Molina – Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti – and the incomparable and talented Sally Field gave the performance of their lives.

","O my, I was expecting some serious action and laughs with this movie but what I didn't expect was the quality drama and tears in my eyes as well. We have a lot of superhero blockbusters coming out these years and most of them have a good combination of action/drama/comedy. It's hard to top that, but TAS2 does it loud and clear.<br/><br/>The story about what happened to Peter's parents when they left him is revealed in this movie, a new evil is created, an old friend full of grudge returns, the love story between Peter and Emma develops and Spider-man/Peter is trying to cope with all of this. In between the action scenes there is plenty of room for drama, character development, comedy but it never distracts from the story itself. They all serve the story and makes it more and more exciting to know what happens next. Because it's so well written, directed, designed and acted you shift from excitement, bursts of laughter, tears, enjoyment and back and forth. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is perfect as the nerdy, sexy, troubled, dauntless Peter Parker and Emma Stone delivers a great intelligent, brave, sultry, strong, struggling Gwen Stacy. And all the other actors around them deliver great performances as well. And with an exciting cliff-hanger at the end I can hardly wait for the third amazing installment.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-man 2 is an amazing trip and I loved every second of it. 10/10"
"timbodickson","1","13","43","3 June 2014"," Are Sony the new Spider Slayers?
","Let me get something straight from the start - I LOVE SPIDER MAN. I'm not one of those people who watches a film just so he can slag it off, or worse still, gives a film a bad review without even seeing the movie. <br/><br/>Sony's approach to the franchise seems to be rather like that of a nasty little boy who pulls the legs off spiders one by one to see if they are still able to walk. After the great successes achieved by Sam Raimi's first 2 Spidey films, the studio have interfered constantly, sending the series into a rapidly downward spiral.<br/><br/>I'll admit I wasn't a fan of Webb's first 'Amazing Spider Man', but I'd hoped that the director and studio would have learned from their mistakes and decided to give them another try. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this one is worse than the first. Peter Parker is portrayed as a self-centred slacker, who seems to have no problem with stalking his ex-girlfriend, or derailing her dreams for the future. So much for your friendly neighbourhood spider-man!<br/><br/>The CGI is poor, and looks very cartoon-like. <br/><br/>The pacing of the film is awful. The film starts with an action-packed opening scene featuring characters we know nothing about, which sets the scene for a pointless subplot, which does nothing other than to slow the film down (and makes Parker act like a dick to his girlfriend and aunt). We then have a frenetic opening sequence where Paul Giamatti is completely wasted. <br/><br/>So far, not so bad. However, that's pretty well all the action you get. Over the next 90 minutes, you get one fight with Electro, surrounded by endless clumsy, slow, embarrassingly-scripted soap scenes. I honestly struggled to stay awake. <br/><br/>But the worst is yet to come.<br/><br/>Eventually we do finally get to a climactic action scene, where Spidey takes down the film's bad guy, Electro. Except, that's not all. All of a sudden, out of nowhere they decide to add the Green Goblin to the mix, wasting one of the Marvel Universe's most dramatic and Iconic moments (the moment when comics lost their innocence)in what amounts to little more than a 3-minute long 'epilogue'. <br/><br/>Then,having completely wasted the Green Goblin for no apparent reason other than to extend the film (and show off a bit of 3D), they then add in yet another bad guy in a very silly final scene. Impressively, they manage to waste the usually-excellent Giamatti for a second time.<br/><br/>Dreadful!<br/><br/>If I was Avi Arad, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee, or anyone with any power at Disney or Marvel Studios, I'd move heaven and earth to try to get the rights back from Sony before they are allowed to destroy the character forever."
"michaelhirakida","8","6","16","24 May 2014"," It's Good. But Here are 5 Good Reasons why The Spider-man Trilogy was Better.
","This movie I think is an improvement over the first reboot film. But still, some things have bothered me including how it still does not live up to the original trilogy. So Here is 10 reasons why The Spider Man Trilogy was better than the rebooted franchise.<br/><br/>1. Spider-Man Himself. Toby Maguire will always be my favorite actor to play Spider-Man. He had the wit and confidence that he had in the comics which made him look believable and although he had strange moments, he still was great. Andrew Garfield is definitely getting much better at this role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. But it still shows that you cannot replace what was already perfected.<br/><br/>2. Characters. Triple J doesn't show up anywhere in this movie. At least in the trilogy, he had some screen-time and had a great actor (J.K Simmons) to play him which made him breathe more life. He is only mentioned in the movie and I am beginning to doubt we will ever see him in 3 and 4 which have been announced. Also, The Rhino character is never developed and just seems to be there for fan service.<br/><br/>3. Harry Osborn. Oh my god. Dane Dehaan is not a bad actor OK? He is not. He has had some good roles but oh my god. What have they done to Harry?! Harry in the trilogy was Peter's best friend for ages and they went to school together. He wanted revenge from Spider-Man because he thought he was killed by him! They developed this up to the final film and it all became full circle that he wasn't killed! But here, Harry is a bratty immature kid who hasn't seen Peter in years, lets a girl run the corporation and turns immediately into a sociopath because Spider- Man doesn't give him his blood as he is dying from some kind of poison his father had. Wow. Just wow. They are missing the point and credibility of this character and the story! Also, James Franco did better as Harry and his acting was 100 times better.<br/><br/>4. Electro. Jesus almighty. Jamie Foxx plays this very scary and awkward looking man named Max who is incredibly obsessed with Spider-Man. I did not like this guy at all because his motive as a villain was 'To Make People Understand Him.' and 'To have a Friend' Are you SERIOUS!?!!?!? This is his motive? Even Venom from Spider-Man 3 had a better motive as a villain. <br/><br/>5. The Ending. So Gwen is Dead... oh. Was I suppose to say Spoilers? Peter is mourning and it is obvious that Harry (Who is now the Green Goblin by this point) had killed her when they were fighting. But some things bother me. Harry is in the asylum or something and they let this mysterious looking guy in and Harry tells him to get criminals out of prison and make them kill Peter Parker/Spider-Man. OK. Shouldn't Harry Be in some kind of room where he has a straight jacket on and let no one but the staff in this room? Also, Peter watches a video of Gwen's speech at the graduation ceremony which should make him mourn more, but instead, he decides to come out of hiding and become Spider-Man Again! Ugh. <br/><br/>But I did enjoy it even with these flaws. The 3D was great, The Stan Lee cameo was funny as always, The Acting is getting better, The Effects are cool, Some Funny Moments, Story was developed OK for the most part. So if you did enjoy the first reboot film, you are surely to like this.<br/><br/>82/100 B"

It really gave it that Ghostbustery feel to it! Seeing the commercials it did annoy me that Electro wasn't in his classic uniform, but quickly realized they were going for a Spidey vs Dr. Manhattan fight, the bald, blue, teleportation and all! This may annoy people, but I thought it ended up pretty cool! Also even though I knew from the get-go she would die exactly as she did in the film, I was still shocked that they did it, so there you go from a fan, you can still pull off what's on the page and get the same reaction! It's classic and a masterpiece for a reason. Some things should never be changed and I'm so happy the makers of this film really went classic, I think they are starting to learn from their elders (the comics)."

But PLEASE see the amazing Captian America: The Winter Soldier first!<br/><br/>I like the Spider-Man character, I liked Sam Rami's Spider-Man 1, loved 2, 3, and Amazing 1. I've loved the animated Spectacular Spider-Man and the 90's animated show (at least at the time). And I've loved the graphic novels...<br/><br/>I certainly WANTED to like this despite the reviews, but...wow.<br/><br/>It's not 90's (live action) ""Batman"" horrific, but Electro could have stepped straight out of those. I winced every time he was on screen...he's that bad, and doesn't feel like he comes from the same universe as anything else in this film, or any other Marvel related film. INCREDIBLY poorly written and acted...I'll trust that the acting isn't Jamie Foxx's fault, that he's just doing what they told him to do, but it's truly horrific. After writing that I realized actually the other...villains are either bad, or really terrible too.<br/><br/>Not every moment is a disaster. I'm sure everyone will have some fun here and there, but I don't even think Emma Stone nor Andrew Garfield were that good here. They have way too little screen time together, and when they do it's mostly the same mumbled conversation over and over again. There are chunks of the film where Peter and Gwen could have been together, going through the motions of the plot TOGETHER, so at least they'd have more screen time and you'd see them having a relationship.<br/><br/>Going in to this film I was baffled how Sony thought they could spin off much from it. The ONLY Spider-Man spin off I'd actually like would be a May Parker (i.e. his daughter from the alternate Marvel 2 universe). Would love to see her on the big screen (if it was WELL WRITTEN), but I have no desire to see a bunch of bad guys teaming up. Now that I've seen it, I have even LESS desire. The bad guys in this ranged from bad and rushed to embarrassing...more often cringe inducing.<br/><br/>They want to spin this off but they haven't come remotely close to making the core Spider-Man film work...<br/><br/>If this is the best Sony can do with it, I wish the rights would revert to Marvel. As it is, I'm worried the VASTLY superior Marvel films actually made by Marvel are going to be damaged by having this around."

","When you glance at the latest Marvel villain Electro with a squint of the eye, he sort of resembles Mr. Freeze from the infamous BATMAN AND ROBIN, which is pure heaven compared to THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2...<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was way too hipster-mopey the first time around, and now he can't stop cracking wise as he jovially leaps through the air defending residents of New York City. With a witty line for just about everything, his goofy behavior as superhero awkwardly clashes with the real guy inside, Peter Parker During corny scenes with love interest Gwen Stacy, Garfield's performance is downright TWILIGHT, or else he's so smug and sarcastic there's never a sense of urgency... But Pete ain't the only problem here <br/><br/>Instead of legitimate foes we're stuck with boring antagonists who hate Spider-Man because they really, deep down, love him to tears: This includes Jamie Foxx's hammy portrayal of gap-toothed geek Max Dillon, a frustrated electrician at the plot-pivotal Oscorp Corporation who, once he falls into a vat of electric eels, can manipulate his very own lightning bolts and plunges into light sockets. After his first face-off with Spider-Man, the glowing menace winds up at an old school sanitarium where he's eventually sought after by villain number two, or one, or something<br/><br/>Enter Dane DeHaan playing THE DARK KNIGHT style Harvey Dent/Two-Face of the film That is, it takes a really long time before Harry Osbourn changes into his own inevitable persona – in this case, Green Goblin: An 11th hour transformation resulting in two bland battles for the price of one, making the epilogue's intentionally campy robotic-rhino seem a much better candidate to have battled Spider-Man the whole way through...<br/><br/>Simplistic or not, at least he has pride in his villainy!"
"midas-jacobs","1","7","20","3 April 2016"," The less amazing spider-man
","In the second installment of the reboot we have the following story, which is... I have no clue. There are to many sub story lines, but the main one is about Electro fighting with Spider-Man. I believe...<br/><br/>This movie is directed by the same director of the first movie. He is called, ironically, Marc Webb. He poorly directed this movie, the previous one he did way better. In this one you can see that he didn't put any effort in the movie. He also used a lot of lens flares, and angled shots. These look ugly combined. Very ugly, and he uses them a lot. I can't remember if this is used in the first movie. The cinematography isn't that great too. I just didn't find myself thinking that it was shot nicely. The editing wasn't good too. You can see this in the beginning of the movie, with the chase scene. They think that they create a lot of tension with quickly edited scenes, but it doesn't. It really doesn't. In this scene we also meet Rhino and Electro. This was the beginning of an overcrowded movie. There is also a use of shaky cam. Also in the beginning of the movie, but this time in the airplane scene. Here they probably used it, because this is one of the only fight scenes I think they used real people. Shaky cam is also a technique to create 'tension' with me it only creates anger. It's so obnoxious, and every director of mindless action movies uses it. Which says enough. The director also likes his slow motion. This was overused. The scenes in slow motion looked like they were created by a computer, which they were, but it didn't look good. You can also clearly notice that the movie is produced/made by Sony, there is lot's of product placement. A lot. <br/><br/>The acting fine. Well, for the most part. Let's start with the main character. Peter Parker, or as we also know him, Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield played him. I think that he was a good casting choice. He was good, I liked him. Then we have his girlfriend, sort of, Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone. I liked her too, but just not her relationship with Peter, and I will touch on this subject later. The bad acted roles come now. But let me say first, these are not bad actors, they are good in some movies, but the director just didn't directed them good enough. The first one I will discuss, is also the main villain. Electro, played by Jamie Fox. He overacted his roles as Max. It was mostly funny to watch. The other villain was the green goblin. He was played by Dane Dehaan. Dehaan has done good movies where he was good in (""Chronicle"" or ""the place beyond the pines""), but in this movie he made the same mistake as Fox. He overacted. Also about the part where you can see this the most, I will discuss in a bit. <br/><br/>The writing is the biggest problem of the movie. Everything is way too convenient. But let's first go to the dialogue. This was just plain bad. The love dialogue was cringe worhty. But overall there were some dumb moments in the dialogue. There is literally a scene where Gwen says that she is okay with Peter stalking her. WHAT THE F*CK. Why would you ever be fine with that? What? But not just in the dialogue. For example the filthy face scene, or the cheesy hero-montage. And one of the funny things is, is that they try to be emotional at times. It's just so funny to watch. An example of this is the appearance of the dad of Gwen, or the death of Osborn. But to come back to the relationship between Gwen an Peter. It feels like it is written by a 12 year old. <br/><br/>But now to touch on some other things. There are a lot of clichés in this movie. German professor? check. References pushed right in your face? check. Love hate relationship? check... The list goes on. ANd like I said there are a lot of conveniences. All of the characters conveniently meet each other. But that's not the only thing, there are other things but these will come. My problem with Electro/Max is of course the acting, but also the origin story, it was so bad it was funny, and this was also due to the acting. But his motive to hate Spider-Man is stupid. In five seconds he goes from loving him to hating him. But I hated Green Goblin. When he transformed in to him, it was also funny to watch. But the worst part, and convenient part comes with the costume. I just appears. He immediately knows how to use it, and what all his gadgets are. What? come on! The story overall sucked, it tried to be to much, but failed at it. Oh and I last thing. Why does Electro create music when he hits the electric poles at the end? What the F*ck!<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this review of the horrible Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>1/10"
"sastorytellerfilms","10","7","20","12 May 2014"," Superior superhero film with a music score worthy of superman
","This movie is an absolute masterpiece! Spiderman 2 blasts onto the screen with 300 times more power than the first film. This is everything the first film should have been. I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy but this movie just nailed it. Every single character is developed, likable, and Andrew Garfield had finally shown he is worthy to wear the suit. If they keep making them like this they will save the spiderman franchise indefinitely. Jaimie Foxx was excellent as Electro and Dane DeHaan played Harry Osborn with so much heart you literally like him even more when he becomes a villain. His own company messes him over so bad they deserve everything that happens to them. The love story in this movie is so moving you will fall in love with it. I went into this movie expecting a good hero movie and they delivered an astonishing creation of filmmaking excellence. Spidey is back the best he's ever been since the first Raimi film. Keep em coming guys!"
"nick-sultana","7","7","20","21 April 2014"," A Superior Sequel That Delivers Excellence and a Promising Franchise to come
","Dark, suspenseful, emotional, funny and indeed epic, the sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man is a pure jolt of excellence in terms of 'superhero' movies. Just like we saw in the incredible sequel Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the leading hero is pitted by not only diabolical enemies but is faced by personal problems that change the way the story's hero fits into the world.<br/><br/>Continuing on from where the first film left off. Peter Parker may have accepted his destiny to be the heroic Spider-Man for New York but he still faces the mystery of his parent's disappearance and promise he kept to Gwen Stacy's father, being that she had to be out of his alter ego role due to the dangers Peter's enemies can cause both himself and Gwen. Meanwhile, Max Dillon an Oscorp Industries employee who is often outspoken by others, feels alone in the world and is an obsessive fan of Spider-Man who had saved his life in the opening action/chase sequence after the prologue. However is life is soon to be different forever when is he's involved in a bad accident that causes him to mutate into a living electricity generator (becoming Electro) and where else Harry Osborne has returned home from boarding school to find his terminally dying father from a family- hereditary illness and Peter attends to amend their long-gone friendship (despite his current status). What follows next for Peter Parker is an journey that will not only help discover who he is meant to be, but will ultimately alter his life for what he discovers and faces against will have consequences, choices and great responsibility.<br/><br/>TASP 2 goes further in character development than the first movie; it is this installment that defines why Peter has become Spider-Man for a reason. The film-makers here chose to have the origin story expanded here as it plays a big role in the hero's journey; the audience is taken to see why Peter's parents had disappeared on him and for a reason that defines why trust and responsibility are important for Peter. The way the story is presented too is much a comic book; there are many great camera shots that is like each panel of any comic book but only on the screen, never losing itself or leaving any plot holes in the process. If you know the comic book's storyline by heart, you can expect what is coming but as well be surprised by the unexpected.<br/><br/>The love story between Peter and Gwen is interesting all the way, the relationship they share is emotional, touching and deep and the acting chemistry from Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is strong (and in my opinion Oscar worthy as well if the film were to be nominated). Just don't take it as a cheesy romance at first; it often plays out like a serious 'Drama' movie type relationship but once every while it has its cute moments to share to lighten. But it's near the end that will break the audience's hearts for what occurs in the story, I won't give too much detail but it left me and other audience members feeling sorry for both characters (this could have not been achieved by the acting talents of Garfield and Stone).<br/><br/>The villains too here are as important as the story's hero, two of which have a personal journey that transforms them into the threatening dangers that Spider-Man/Peter faces in the film. These gives the audience a deep insight into why we should care for them or even hate them, but it gave me a feeling that the villains were out to reach their goals of domination and be their own hero in their world. The performances from both Dane DeHann and Jamie Foxx is achieving and convincing enough to make their villains believable and a reason to exist in the story. All the leading and supporting characters in the film all have emotion and wow moments of any kind, and the relationships they all have in one way or another is indeed amazing. <br/><br/>The action sequences here are all intense, dark and very exciting in every way imaginable like in the comics, it seemed like a big step up for the film-makers to top the action sequences as shown in the previous film but giving more punch, realism and quality (though the first film had impressive sequences as well). It may not appear as often as the first one did, but the timing of where action is needed is placed well; as story and character is every bit as important as the original comic source. The climatic finale indeed had my heart racing till the very end, making me glued to the screen as much as its plot.<br/><br/>Lastly, the music score in the film is composed and performed by the always amazing Hans Zimmer (Man of Steel, Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy) but working alongside The Magnificent Six (seems like a new collaboration was formed). All I can say that it is incredible; the music pieces performed in TASP 2 are worth listening to and will definitely stay in your head for days to come. Each of the leading characters in the film has their own music themes but it's Electro's theme that is catchy.<br/><br/>To summarize, The Amazing Spider–Man 2 is both a superior sequel that delivers excellence, emotion, quality and sets the confirmed third film to be anticipating and promising a stronger franchise to come in future. I have already seen this twice and I could see it again and again"
"laue97","9","7","20","21 April 2014"," Spidey getting me caught in his web
","First off, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie. I have been so excited to see this movie for months. I must admit that it has lived up to every expectation! The performances giving by everyone was just fantastic. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is just so amazing and believable. Which it should be because they are going out in real life. Andrew owns the spider-man role now, this movie has convinced me so. Also, Jamie Foxx nails it as Max Dillion. He gives such a killer performance as awkward and sad max. He doesn't let you down as Electro either. Also, a worthy mention is none other than Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborn. This guy really got the acting chops! He can be friendly and charismatic when needed. But, he can also pull off intimidating and demanding without even breaking a sweat. Not to mention his Goblin Laugh that just gave me shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>The Sound track was also really good. This is one of the few movies that make me want the album. Many people thought this movie was going to be to villain heavy not at all. All the villains got their fair share of screen time. The action was up to pare as well especially the final electro battle. The only real gripe that I have with this movie was that I thought the action sequences were a bit short. But, they were still pretty epic please don't get me wrong. I think this also may be the most emotional super hero movie I have ever seen in my life. I will just leave it at that without any spoilers. Now that is a good thing in my book. That is one of the many reasons why I can't stop thinking about this movie.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is probably up there in the 5 spidey movies that are out there. This movie was a joy ride from start to finish. The action sequences were intense but short, everyone had a purpose and the movie didn't feel over crowded, it was funny, it was sad, in was intense. You will not go wrong putting down 11 bucks to see this movie trust me. I hope Marc Webb comes back to direct the 3rd one, he is making a good name for himself with these movies."
"neil-476","9","7","20","17 April 2014"," First rate
","Peter Parker continues to enquire into his parents' disappearance while being pitted against electrical supervillain Electro.<br/><br/>My view of this film's predecessor was pretty half-hearted - I wasn't terribly keen on a rebooted origin movie so soon after the previous trilogy, and I didn't think Curt Connors/The Lizard was either that good a villain or particularly well realised. This second episode makes it clear that we are looking at a story arc which runs over all three films, and puts to rest all the misgivings - yes, all of them - which I had after the first movie.<br/><br/>Specifically - Electro is a much better villain, there are some terrific action set pieces, I actually liked Sally Field in a film for the first time ever, and there is a lot of emotion here. My one criticism is that the film is continued past its obvious conclusion point. I don't want to say more for fear of spoilering.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this, and I am greatly looking forward to part 3."
"marianoamezaga-995-605017","2","11","36","8 May 2014"," Horrible, a waste of time and money
","First of all, excuse me for my non-perfect English. Second of all, what a TRASH movie this was! I will admit that I didn't read the spider-man- comics, or at least I read very few of them, therefore I cant consider myself a huge spider fan apart from seeing the movies. And I have been told that this new trilogy is supposed to be more loyal to the comics, so maybe I'm missing something, because that is the only explanation I can find for anybody thinking this movie wasn't the worst one of the 5 Spiderman movies released yet. I mean, seriously, this was a joke. I had the strange feeling that all the time I was just watching an extensive trailer of a movie, as everything seemed to happen too quickly. Beginning with Peter and Gwen breaking up ""dramatically"" at the very beginning of the movie, already with that crap of ""I don't know if I should leave you because I love you so much or I should stay with you because I love you so much"". I mean, I don't know, it makes it look so simple, so stupid. You cant really feel anything during the movie and that includes when Peter finds out the ""truth"" about his parents (another very lame and simplistic scene)and finally when Gwen dies (luckily). Absolute no real emotions during those scenes. It was probably the least memorable death of film history. Then...the ""villains"". God, probably the worst ones of all the marvel movies. Totally underdeveloped characters who don't provoke anything to the audience, least of all fear, anger or even respect. And the worst part is, there were even 3 of them, as if 1 wasn't enough. Electro, Harry and ""Rhino"" (or whatever) were just laughable figures in a really dull movie, which has some ""memorable"" moments, such as when Peter goes to the secret subway station and discovers this hidden lab, which ""magically"" arises from the floor *irony on*totally unexpected *irony off*. Oh and another part I really liked was Peter crying like a little bay when...wait, during the entire movie. But somehow I didn't have the need to cry as well, guess that makes me a villain. I just wanted to leave the theater since the middle of the movie and the only reason I didn't do that was because I wanted to know how far the ship could sink. And...man,it did sink very, very deep. It will be very difficult to lift it up again to the surface wit the next movie, which I wont bother to watch anyway. Really good job ruining the series, Webb and writers."
"frederickrmiller","3","11","36","6 May 2014"," A ""must see"" but only at matinée price
","When I ignored the criticism of the reboot, and saw Amazing Spider-Man, I was pretty pleased and optimistic that this new version was going to overcome the odds and be a trilogy that would stand on it's own merits. It appears my optimism was unfounded. Perhaps the good feelings I walked away with from the first movie were accidental. I never thought I would see anything as bad as the 3rd installment of Sam Raimi's trilogy, but I was wrong. Amazing 2 suffers from a very poor plot, or was there even a shred of a plot present? You judge for yourself, but hopefully cut your loss a bit by viewing at a lower matinée price. 3D can't do much to fix a poor plot, poor acting, or actor apathy towards gag me with a spoon dialogue. Garfield's Peter Parker comedy falls so flat it actually pales in comparison to Maguires dance club travesty. If you are a 3D fan, by all means throw down your money. The line up of villains looks promising on paper, but as executed in this film their villainous role is best viewed as bringing an apocalypse to the Super Hero movie genre. Note to Sony: perhaps Harry Osborne on a Goblin Glider is not such a good idea? Thank God Marvel released the far superior Captain America 2 far in advance of this. If CA2 had instead followed this, movie goers post AS2 super hero apathy could have done some serious damage. I expect Godzilla to take Amazing 2 down very quickly, and it will be up to the X-Men to restore some superhero excitement to movie viewers."

","where can i start?.. aside from the poorly written and sappy love story and lame villains this film may actually be worth watching. now I'm not going to spoil anything about the movie but i will touch on plot points that were in the trailer.<br/><br/>to start the film begins with Peter Parker and Gwen Stacys sappy love story that just feels out of place, now the two actors had great chemistry and are great actors, but the writing was surprisingly bad in this movie and had me bored 90% of the movie. there was just to much of a love story rather then Spiderman, i didn't pay 10$ to watch a twilight superhero movie.<br/><br/>the villains in this film were goofy and forced especially with the rhino and green goblin, Electro was fine but they tried to make him look intimidating but failed at that. he had the most character development out of everyone. the green goblin felt rushed and was shoe horned into the movie and i think people would agree he just looked stupid when he become the goblin. i don't even want to get into the rhino because you'll laugh of how little screen time he had and how much of goofy pointless character he is.<br/><br/>a plus in the movie is that it had a lot of interesting Easter eggs throughout the film and that the spidy's outfit is my favorite out of them previous ones. that isn't going to save the movie though... the whole time it just felt like it was a setup for the sinister 6 instead of being a good sequel to an awesome sequel.<br/><br/>biggest disappointment of the year by far. i have never been so bored watching a superhero in my life. it was more suited what almost seemed like for kids. humor just wasn't there when it tried to be.<br/><br/>on a side notes DO NOT STAY FOR THE POST CREDITS SCENE! trust me it will anger you deeply"
"cristian-a-laine","3","11","36","5 May 2014"," TASM2 = too much hype for nothing... huge disappointment...
","First of all, i have to say that nowadays these movie-producers and film-companies makes trailers which looks just spectacular and that was the reason, why i wanted to see ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"". But yesterday evening, when i started to watch this movie, after 30 minutes, i was so disappointed for everything i saw. This new Spidey, Andrew Garfield is really bad actor, he also doesn't look interesting, he doesn't wake up any emotions when i see his acting and also Emma Stone for sure not suit in serious roles, because she is same time overacting and looks like semi-dirty hooker. For her, only suitable movie-roles is comedy roles for example ""Easy-A"" etc.<br/><br/>IN Spider-Man movies (NOT ""The Amazing Spider-Man"") Tobey Maguire as spidey was perfect choice to be spidey. Nerd guy, who looks credible in his part (funny, serious, emotional). But of course all good comes to the end and writers/producers destroyed Spider-Man-trilogy with Tobey Maguire goofy and insane dancing and filled those movies with cliché after cliché. And when you compare Willem Dafoe's and James Franco acting to TASM2... well, they did theirpart as villains perfectly. Dane DeHaan is just ridiculously bad actor. He is in my top 5 worse and most annoying actors in DC comic movies.<br/><br/>I have to ask, what is happened for the audiences? Why people rank these movies so high in IMDb?!? Have you really lost your capability to rate acting, script, twists, overall story etc. If you look this TASM2 again with time and focus on actors, script and everything else, you have to see and understand that these new spidey-movies has bad script and story, terrible actors, for example Dane DeHaan, who looks like discount young Leonardo DiCaprio IN VERY ANNOYING way and takes overacting to completely new level. DeHaan and especially his ""acting"" is so annoying, that when i see his face, i wanted to punch him and stop watching this film. Only actor who makes decent work is of course Jamie Foxx as Electro, but WHY he had to be some kind of cliché GOOFY-CRAZY genius? WHY!?!? We have seen this so many times, and it never suits for these highly talented and spectacular actors. I just have to ask, why he couldn't be just talented, intelligent and genius lab-rat (Bruce Banner/Edward Norton style), who became Electro after accident. Why they need to make Jamie Foxx look like retarded-monkey?!? Fight scenes was boring, and also new Rhino is ridiculous. To destroy one of the most interesting super-villain in Spidey movies they had to made him as machine, not monster-mutation as he is in cartoons. What else?!<br/><br/>I don't accept that these highly hyped and over 100 million budget movies are made as bad as TASM2. I hope they launch one more time new Spidey-concept and this time they choose real actors and makes perfect story etc. This movie was just BIGGEST disappointment and only made to cash out money as much as possible(("

"mattsenior90","1","13","45","20 August 2014"," This franchise is dead!
","This movie was a complete joke!!! It's called editing Sony...heard of it? The screen writer should be fired first. Then the director and whoever signed off on the film at Sony. Electro was a boring villain (think Django with electric veins) and he was the ONLY villain until the last 20 minutes of the movie. By the way...the movie was 2:20 long so you get two hours of Electro and less than 20 minutes of the Green Goblin and only the last 10 minutes has the Rhino. This wouldn't be a big deal if the movie had been sold on the merits of only Electro as the movie's villain and then surprised you with the extra two but all the commercials and pre-work talked about a movie stacked with all three bad guys. And why are they remaking a series that was only 10 years old anyway? I know they screwed up the Green Goblin the first time around, and I'll admit that he was a cool villain in the new movie, but make him the featured bad guy instead of being a little extra salt and pepper on your eggs. Not to mention his only scene in the clock tower as well as the cemetery stuff (hint hint) was so contrived! I'm a movie crier but this one just made me laugh. Oooo...and Doc Oct's arms were such a titillating teaser (not so much)! I enjoy superhero movies and especially enjoy the Marvel line but they need to pull the plug on this franchise...it's dead. That's 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Thanks Sony..."
"infinitelyprolonged42","3","13","45","24 April 2014"," Sony ruins TAS yet again because of their financial crisis.
","I could just say that the reason why this movie is painfully bad is Sony and their continuing attempts at saving their own asses from bankruptcy through the film industry, and it would be enough, it is blatantly obvious because of the target demographics, the annoying MTV influenced soundtrack (Electro's ultimate power of DUBSTEP! Not to mention, roll credits: Alicia Keys?!?!?! ft Kendrick Lamar?!?!?! But I'm wasting precious words.) and the weird, unnatural public display of affection between the two main characters turning them into a celebrity couple you see in the yellow pages and tabloids and the unbelievably dehumanizing, senseless and just plain stupid E! channel. <br/><br/>I love Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield and I am just sorry that the industry used their natural charm and chemistry towards a sinister cause of appealing to the lowest teenage urges. The horrors of Stephenie Meyer's hell-spawn still echo in the world and Sony's here to cash in.<br/><br/>But I have more to say as a devotee to Spider-Man and Peter Parker, his story being a huge influence on my life. <br/><br/>What they are doing to this story is inexcusable. But so is the majority of corporate made films. You know what I lost the will to write a good (bad) review because in the end it all comes down to money money money.<br/><br/>At least Marvel has the guts to stay true to their fans even if they are making movies for money, at least they're actually good movies with tight and thought through scripts. It's all a big franchise but they don't make a 2 hour promo for the next movie like TAS2 is, each one has it's own gripping story that is cleverly connected to the next one. <br/><br/>We've been lured in by the promise of The Gauntlet which in the comics was an amazing and deep storyline, but all we have got was a rushed(seriously, spidey says ""no"" and that immediately turns him into the green freakin' goblin), washed out Goblin reboot with absolutely no back-story and less consequence than Rocky IV, Stallone-like acting included with Dane DeHaan. He was really a bad choice for Harry Osborn, but I guess he tested well in the demographics. And the goblin curse being a deadly genetic disease? NO! That's a cop-out. The Goblin curse is power-lust (and borderline personality disorder), Norman Osborn is the incarnation of evil that corrupts his entire family and lineage, not some selfish money-hungry corporate suit spending money to heal himself from a disease that makes him look like a toad. <br/><br/>What else, oh yeah the inevitable and completely unnecessary Sinister Six promo character Aleksei Sytsevich AKA Rhino who they managed to turn, in the American fashion, from a deep character, a mean giant with a huge heart to a tattooed, clichéd remnant of Soviet Russia the USA is afraid of as a competitor in economic domination and wants to keep the American nation alert to ""the menace in the east"". <br/><br/>Oh and there was Electro? Was there? I hadn't noticed. Max Dillon, reduced to nothing more than a lackey, which he truly is, but why center the movie around him if he just ended up being muscle? There are so many more deep and complicated characters in the Spidey universe to explore and somehow we always wind up at the most cheesy ones making them even more cheesy and underdeveloped. An awkward attention-seeking genius electrician finds great power and with it an even greater opportunity to seek attention! It has absolutely no logical sense and is insulting to intelligent people all over the world being reduced to ugly attention-seekers. Always with the misunderstood genius goes bad, it's tiresome.<br/><br/>What I truly felt was good is the last 20 minutes of the movie. Gwen Stacy does die, it is Peter's fault and it crushes him even more so but this is the truly defining moment of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He carries on, always guided by what he has promised to himself, and to his uncle Ben, but now reinforced with what had happened to Gwen. From now on he will stand at nothing but to be the best super-hero the world has ever seen. Also I like how the connection between him an Aunt May was established. It's not reaaaally that believable but they're on the right track. <br/><br/>Last thoughts, and the only necessary thing really:<br/><br/>Music:<br/><br/>Captain America: Winter Soldier ----> Marvin Gaye - Trouble Man<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 ---> Alicia Keys - It's on again?!?!?!?!?!<br/><br/>It's on again? Damn right it's on again, on and off again to make money on ruining people's dreams and hope of a good life. Thanks Sony!"

Jamie Foxx's character was amazing and I truly did feel bad for him at some points, but when he fell into the electric eel pit to become Electro was a little ridiculous. Dane Dehaan did a great job portraying Harry Osborn/The Green Goblin and I loved the fact that he could go from 0 to 20 in .05 seconds. The casting for this movie was almost spot on, but I didn't feel as though the Russian shooter guy who eventually turns into Rhino was very convincing as a bad guy. He just smiled like a wacko and had this weird laugh. Nothing else. <br/><br/>The special effects were just amazing.

"ferguson-6","6","5","13","11 May 2014"," Down Came the Rain
","Greetings again from the darkness. This follow-up to The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) seems to have the mission of throwing as much onto the screen as possible. There are not one, but three key villains, a teenage love story, a deathbed scene, numerous moments of soul-searching, a stream of wise cracks and puns, the most outrageous laboratory setting, a cartoonish evil doctor accent, the furrowed brow of Aunt Mary (Sally Field), flashbacks and video of the mysterious father, teasers for future movies, and of course, enough action and special effects to ward off any thoughts of peace.<br/><br/>Personally, I find Andrew Garfield to be a nice fit as Spidey, but I just can't buy him as ultimate science geek Peter Parker. He bumbles about and bats his eyes too much for my tastes, and can't stand toe to toe with Gwen Stacy (real life squeeze Emma Stone) in scientific banter. Still, the original story is interesting enough that any minor issues are easily overlooked.<br/><br/>At its core, this entry is a story of revenge. The foundation for Peter Parket's troubles all stem from Oscorp, so we are treated to some behind the facade sets that will keep viewers on their toes. After an initial face-off with bad guy Aleksei Sytsevich (a maniacal Paul Giamatti), we see the transformation of goofy Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) into the shocking (get it?) Electro. If that's not enough, childhood buddies Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) are reunited to set the stage for more good vs evil.<br/><br/>The story would have benefited from more concentration on any of these three stories, while dropping one altogether. The viewer would have benefited from a slower jolt (one more!) in the transformation of Max to Electro. We needed to find the humanity, rather than just desperation. The same goes for Peter and Harry. The dots are a bit too far apart for connection, though DeHaan (so good in Lawless and Chronicle) is a striking contrast to the doe-eyed, beautifully coiffed Garfield.<br/><br/>It's nice to see Stone's Gwen portrayed as a smart, ambitious young woman who also understands how demanding a relationship is, and the responsibility that goes with dating a superhero. Speaking of responsibility, the lack of Uncle Ben's influence here is disturbing, though probably necessary given the exploration of backstory on Peter's parents (Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz).<br/><br/>When Paul Giamatti reappears near the end as Rhino, it's a bit difficult to not think ""enough is enough"". And oddly, this fight sequence ends abruptly, evidently setting the stage for future Spidey. And speaking of the future, the end credits scene plays as nothing more than a teaser trailer for the next X-Men movie, while robbing us of any details to the Sinister Six.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I feel somewhat overdosed on Superhero and Comic book adaptations, yet the action and effects are still quite fun to watch, even if director Marc Webb (Ok, that pun is too easy) seems to jumble up too many story lines."

The comical elements where put all in the right places and presented effortlessly by the actors and actresses. The slow motion elements really made this film when watching it in 3D, but i wouldn't say it was necessary to see it in 3D.<br/><br/>I've already planned to see it again with a friend and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to go to the cinema (even my sister who isn't a fan of marvel and also hasn't seen the first film loved this one and also cried)"
"GoodMovieGuy","9","5","13","4 May 2014"," Great Movie!! Superb Effect!
","Don't listen to negative comments... this is the BEST spiderman movie EVER! The acting is good, the effect superb! The love story is very believable, the chemistry between spidey and gwen is great! I really like Andrew Garfield as the new Spiderman. He add a touch of humor in Spiderman character. The script is good, I really believe the chemistry between the main characters. Very romantic. As for the effect.. WOW.. I watched it in 3D and boy.. it was sooo good... it was as if I'm doing the swooping myself.. I just don't understand some people who said that this movie is boring. I enjoyed every minute, every scene of the movie. Overall... Great Movie!!!"
"Mjenoff","9","5","13","4 May 2014"," GREAT Superhero movie that thrives on Garfield-Stone chemistry
","I said it after the first reboot and I'll say it again. Stone and Garfield blow McGuire and Dunst out of the water in terms of believability, acting, charm and just overall watch-ability. These movies are also more serious in tone and darker than the originals. After seeing this sequel, it just solidifies this as the better series by a mile IMO. I'm not sure how most people can still argue it. McGuire was such a mopey faced, pathetic spiderman, where as Garfield plays the role perfectly showing cockiness at times, emotion, struggle... <br/><br/>Elektro surprised me... I thought he would be horribly overdone and laughable from the previews. But, I thought his scenes were great and he was a pretty powerful adversary to Spiderman in the film. The Green Goblin was fleshed out much better in this film as compared to the originals also. No stupid metal Halloween costume this time around. It was legit, real, and very dark. Well done.<br/><br/>Stone and Garfield carry the movie with their amazing chemistry, though. I know they're dating in real life and I""m sure that really helps, but these 2 just really click every moment they share the screen. It really gives the movies heart... I've said it all along that the relationship in the movie is just so much better than Spidermans and Mary Janes in the first. In that movie, it was so clichéd with Mary Jane only taking an interest in Parker once he developed the Spiderman traits and humiliated her star QB boyfriend. This relationship is so much more believable and better acted.<br/><br/>There were a few things that kept this movie from being completely perfect. They needed to develop Max a little better before he became Elektro to make us care about the character a little more. He was great as Elektro, not so great as the pathetic Max. Paul Giamati (A great talent) was really bad as Rhino(although for a VERY small portion), they could have left him out of this movie. <br/><br/>I don't understand the harshness about too many villains?? Rhino was literally in the movie for 10 minutes maybe, and never perceived as a major villain... Green Goblin comes in at the very end and ties everything together IMO. He also brings some good emotion and surprise from his scene that really give this movie the emotional punch towards the end and even makes it better a whole. <br/><br/>Perfect? No, but pretty damn good!... Bad like some people are saying? Just crazy..<br/><br/>Hands down better than the originals, and one of the best Spidermans to date"
"suitdnbootd","6","5","13","2 May 2014"," A tough one to get a review from.
","This movie was incredibly difficult for me to feel a love or hate towards. The beginning was set up with maybe to much hype for the villains. On that same note though when the fight scene first started I was really into it because of the anticipation that they built. For the fight scenes two things I personally didn't enjoy. Firstly, they were incredibly short for the amount of build up they had leading into it. Secondly, the scoring was either really spot on or horribly placed and both happened within the five minute scene. The start up of the fights had this music playing with what were like whispers in Jamie Foxx's character head that was there for what seemed to be more build up but was so unneeded. The last negative piece for me was the slow motion bits. Yes the 3D value of these shots were stunning but that's why they were there, to be cool 3D moments. <br/><br/>Anyways in all the movie was far better then the first and overall a very good Marvel superhero movie. <br/><br/>Pros: Great use of villains. Not having them all jump in at once. Awesome cinematic work Story backing was well written <br/><br/>Cons: Long winded beginning Short fight scenes Over used slow motion effect Various scoring problems"
"PassPopcorn","6","5","13","25 April 2014"," Pass the Popcorn! review
","In spite of earning a lot of money, the first installment in The Amazing Spider-Man franchise wasn't a very good movie. It had pacing and script problems while offering nothing new in return, and it overall seemed like a pointless reboot. Luckily, there's the unwritten rule that the sequel to a superhero movie will usually be better than the original. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 follows that rule, and is better than the first one, but not by a long shot. This movie has all the big problems its predecessor had, and if this franchise wants to rise above mediocrity, these problems should definitely be solved in future movies.<br/><br/>Beginning where the last one left, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 follows the life of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he somewhat struggles with being Spider-Man. He is in a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), although he feels guilty because of it, since he promised her late father (Denis Leary) he'll stay away from her. At the same time, he encounters a new threat in form of one Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) – an electrical engineer turned super villain during an accident. Also, Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns to the city after his 8 year long absence, and he seems to have sinister plans of his own.<br/><br/>The best thing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is surely the charisma between its two leads – Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. Garfield found his voice to a greater extent in this movie - he seems somewhat more relaxed and natural in his role and is arguably superior to Tobey Maguire – and, of course, Emma Stone is as sweet and likable as ever. They are accompanied by another strong performance – that of Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn. DeHaan was a breath of fresh air to the franchise and I personally can't wait to see him in future installments. In addition to the overall quality acting, Marc Webb's direction is great, even better than in the first one. Not only that, but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is also a nice combination of, more or less, thrilling action sequences and some grim elements which should generally entertain audiences who are looking for nothing else.<br/><br/>However, once again, the movie utterly fails in this, perhaps most important, aspect – the script. No one expects Oscar-worthy scriptwriting from a superhero movie, but the dialogues (and some scenes) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are laughably ridiculous, and the character of Max Dillon aka Electro was so poorly written that even an experienced actor like Jamie Foxx couldn't save it. Furthermore, once again, the villain designs were horrible: both Electro and Green Goblin looked cartoonishly goofy. And in spite of some action sequences looking great, some of them felt like they were taken directly from a video game (which is never a good thing) and were accompanied by a cheesy dubstep-like soundtrack. In brief, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is better than its predecessor, but that unfortunately isn't enough, since the movie is, at its best, mindless popcorn entertainment, and at its worst is a serious insult to intelligence.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at passpopcorn.com"
"trever64227","7","5","13","21 April 2014"," Amazing Spider-Man 2 Review
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the latest Spider-Man film by Mark Webb. The film stars: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, and Dane DeHann. The movie starts out great, showing how Peter (Garfield) has gotten used to being 'Spider-Man'. He's protecting New York's citizens, putting it's bad guys behind bars, and being the friendly neighborhood hero we all know and love. He is also in the midst of a complicated relationship between him and Gwen Stacy (Stone) involving Peter's hesitance to involve Gwen in his dangerous job as Spider-Man. And before long we meet the films antagonists, Electro (Foxx) and Harry Osborn (DeHann).<br/><br/>Coming out of The Amazing Spider-man 2, I'm weighing out the good and the bad. This movie has its fair share of both. For example, the movie has some great action sequences, making use of stunning visual effects in the process. But these scenes are too short and too few for a 140-minute movie. This, in turn, makes the movie feel sluggish and slow to the point. Fortunately performances by Garfield and DeHann pick up the slack. There is a major improvement in Garfield's acting since the first of the films and DeHann plays a compelling Harry Osborn, even if his darker side as Green Goblin doesn't get as much screen time as Foxx. Which brings me to another downside, Electro. Electro's role in the movie is questionable, as he hardly gets any screen time himself, and doesn't measure up to his evil accomplice, Green Goblin.<br/><br/>As a whole, Amazing Spider-Man 2 has some good acting in it, looks great visually, and is good enough to make an entertaining addition to the Spider-Man franchise."
"koishnoish","7","5","13","17 April 2014"," Good, but there are faults to be found...
","There's probably spoilers in this...<br/><br/>Alright, so I literally just watched this and understand I do like the film. i really do. I think there are many jewels in this film, but I can't help but also point out my personal flaws with the movie.<br/><br/>I'll start with the story, since all good movies should have a good story. For Peter and Gwen it was a love story, a romance that kept getting inevitably interrupted by Peter's duties as the web slinger. For Harry, it was a quest to make sure he didn't die like his father. For Max/Electro it was the quest to... be noticed? Honestly I'm not quite sure what Electro wanted. A spidey fanatic who was treated badly and when electrocuted becomes a electric wielding individual. When unable to control his power fully and almost harming people he then... wants what? Revenge?<br/><br/>This brings me on to the characters, namely Electro. I think one of the most important things in a film is the characters, and in a super hero movie, the villains too. The villains need to have a plan, an end game, if they don't have a conviction and an aim then they're not entertaining. Defoe's Green Goblin suffered from this problem and I think it also applies to Electro here. I just don't get what he planned to do. He gathers up all this power and for what? So people notice him? It seems like a poor drive to me and it only makes the villain look poor to me. Granted Electro blowing things up is a lot of fun to see in the movie but I always felt there wasn't a reason other than to just hurt spider-man just because he stole the spot light.<br/><br/>Then we've got Harry Osbourne. I'll admit I was slightly bummed that we wouldn't have more Norman Osbourne, and for some reason I always preferred Norman being the Green Goblin rather than Harry. DeHaan, I think, gives a very good portrayal of Harry, better than James Franco's, but there are elements of the Harry in this film I just can't jump. How does Harry get so ill so quickly when Norman Osbourne got ill and only died recently at such an old age? Even Norman said 'it started when I was your age', so how did it happen so fast? What was the point of mentioning how Norman threw Harry aside if only to never really delve into how it affected Harry? And the appearance of the Green Goblin... oh god... I hated the look, I did not like the look of the goblin at all. He didn't look scary, he didn't seem insane, he didn't ever really seem a threat, probably because the Goblin is only about 5 minutes of the entire film. And yet again I felt there was no endgame. Why the hell did Harry want to take out Spider- Man? Why? Because Peter didn't give him his blood to save himself so Harry became a monster? That seems more reasonable but after that, then what? There wasn't an endgame for either villains and it really hit the movie hard. I didn't really care for either and I would of loved to have seen more Green Goblin.<br/><br/>I bought the Peter/Gwen relationship, I honestly thought their relationship was the best part of the movie, I think in a way Gwen was more of a threat to Peter than Electro or the Green Goblin ever were and that conclusion, to me, seemed to literally fly out of nowhere.<br/><br/>That brings me to the pacing of this movie, it was all over the place. Half the time it was quick and snappy and the other half the time it moved at the pace of a demented snail. It didn't ever really settle on a speed.<br/><br/>What was the point of the entire 'Roosevelt' thing? I understand it's Peter discovering more about his dad and Oscorp but it added nearly nothing to the story, at all. Peter would of already known Oscorp was bad after realising Connors, Max and Harry had all become monsters after direct involvement with Oscorp. Peter shouldn't need to be told their bad news. In my opinion this scene could have been scrapped for much needed Peter/Harry interaction at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>Seriously, I know it's been ages since Harry and Peter talked but it all felt so stoic to me. I understand the two are a little uncomfortable after such a time apart but I never really bought their supposed friendship.<br/><br/>And Rhino at the end... what even was that ending? I think it would've been more effective to end in the graveyard... even if it does herald back to the first film, I think it would have been a very powerful ending.<br/><br/>I've ripped into this film, but honestly, I really did like it. I bought the romance, I thought most of the acting was solid and the effects were mind blowing. I'm still debating on the score but for now I'll leave it to rest."
"eamonnshadokaraffert-965-845422","7","5","13","16 April 2014"," Amazing Spiderman 2 - The Shuffling of Electro
","Well it's here, after about fifty trailers online leading up to it's release, The Amazing Spiderman 2 has hit the big screen and it's..just good. Had to the potential to be very good but some things get lost in the shuffle of the juggling stories in my opinion. So on with the negatives first.<br/><br/>Well, I could say Paul Giamatti as the would be Rhino was a waste but he's lucky to be even in this film for ten minutes and was obviously written in for the extent of the future Sinister Six storyline/film in the pipeline so really unsure I suppose to call it a waste as it's essentially establishing the character's there and exists to come back in the future. Also the use of music sometimes in this film put me off a bit during some scenes, think there was even a Kid Cudi's 'Pursuit of Happiness Remix' in there somewhere and then there was Electro's Incy Whincy Spider dub step whoosh noise that he made (though Pete does quip about hating that song in the middle of a fight with him).<br/><br/>ANOTHER problem I had was primarily juggling the on/off Pete and Gwen relationship, though you figured by the end of the first one things worked out, we arrive back to square one with Pete looking to end it and then you are literally head on the head along the way of how good of a couple they are, even though their chemistry and exchanges are more hit than miss. One final problem was that for a running time of almost two and a half hours, I still felt slightly short handed as the overall arc and the payoff of his father's disappearance is quite anti-climatic that for the amount of time given from the first film and the amount of time it takes up this film, you would've expected something a bit more.<br/><br/>I sure I actually enjoyed most of this film, especially when it got certain parts right. The character of Electro was almost right. Almost. Jamie Foxx does a very good portrayal of the character, from being the loner and slightly unhinged obsession with Spiderman after the save, to the transformation to Electro and up till the end of the Times Square sequence, I was really looking forward to see where he goes next then he just sort of takes a backseat for a while for Harry Osborn time. Again I have no problem at all with Jamie Foxx's performance, just found the character underwhelming considering the potential and with a few rubbish lines to deal with.<br/><br/>The great performances in this film come from Andrew Garfield, with a Spidey version that I enjoy a lot more than the Maguire one and I think he fits perfectly in the Peter Parker/Spiderman mold for me and Emma Stone's Gwen is as funny and intelligent as ever. The show stealer for me was Dane DeHaan's unnerving performance as Harry Osborn. I liked he tweak in the story this time round of him and his father and that some of the most innocent of lines that he has in parts of the film when talking with a character always comes across as a threat and whereas you are meant to feel sympathy for Max/Electro throughout the film, you kind of give it instead to Harry and what he goes through. Unfortunately the Green Goblin transformation feels rushed and shoehorned in at the last minute but going forward, I look forward to seeing where they go with DeHaan as Harry.<br/><br/>The special effects sequences are in overload in this film and for me in the Times Square sequence it worked while in the final act it just a bit too much into it.<br/><br/>Good film but felt more interested in dealing with the parents plot and setting up for future films rather than dealing with the Electro character at hand, which is a shame for the performance that Foxx puts in. Garfield and Stone more reliable than before but DeHaan is the show stealer. Doesn't top Spiderman 2 in terms of Best Spiderman Film list."
"kenpery","1","11","37","21 August 2014"," Worst super hero movie ever
","The first Amazing Spider-Man movie was pretty good, even though the casting wasn't that good. This one is some of the worst writing ever. The characters are completely unbelievable. No one behaves the way they do. While the actors, themselves, are not that good (especially Emma Stone), and they definitely don't compare well with Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst, the writing is just absolutely ridiculous (especially the dialogs) and part of the problem may be the directing. The goblin makes a very brief appearance and the back story on Harry Osborn was deficient. The special effects demonstrated some great technology but its use was very lame. I could not have been more disappointed in this film. A complete waste of time and money."
"nick-kohn1","9","11","37","20 May 2014"," Awesome movie! Great everything!
","The first spider-man was disappointing. With such a promising buildup to the first one, it was terrible. This movie however, erased my doubts I formed going into the movie theater to see it.<br/><br/>The plot was very interesting throughout the movie. The effects also added to the interest in the movie. I was happy with this storyline opposed to the first one. Rather than using a stupid lizard (which was a stupid idea altogether) the use of two super villains added suspense. As soon as he defeated electro, immediately he had to fight the Green Goblin. I personally felt the use of turning Harry Osborn as the Green Goblin was one of the greatest ideas as opposed to the Spiderman trilogy with Toby McGuire (or however his last name is spelled).<br/><br/>When Stacey died, I was stunned. I sat in shock for a few moments. An incredibly unexpected ending added the the greatness of the movie. If anyone predicted that before seeing the movie, I would have been very impressed.<br/><br/>The cast did a great job to pick up from the disappointment issued from part one. I highly recommend anyone to see the movie as you will enjoy it, and it's quite long (140 minutes) but you will not lose interest. If you though the previous trilogy was good, you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>Hope my review has helped, but in essence, give the movie a shot. The only reason I didn't give it 10/10 was due to some logical problems. I understand Peter loved Stacey, but he is not going to stand there for four seasons. Also, the limited use of the Green Goblin was disappointing. Rather than setting him up for the next movie, they choose to use a Rhino which honestly had no relevance to the movie.<br/><br/>Although I have these criticisms, I am very positive about the movie and enjoyed it thoroughly."
"karthikitsme","3","11","37","4 May 2014"," Not that exciting !
","Nevertheless to say, the superhero movies should excite the audience almost throughout the film. This is possible only if the focus is more on villains, their plots and the way Spiderman handle them. This movie has real good villains like Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino. But almost 60% of the movie concentrates more on the personal side of Spiderman, leaving out very short time for our super hero to take on his enemies.<br/><br/>I like the way Jamie Foxx carried his role as Electro/Max. For sure, this character is portrayed well in this movie. Again, the time allotted for this character is not enough. On the other hand, Green Goblin can be referred as one of the villains in this move just for the name sake. The time given for this role is too short. The third villain, Rhino, is not that great either.<br/><br/>Fans would like to see Spiderman more in action rather than watching him crying almost half of the movie. To add to the woe, this is extended to Green Goblin too! Even this basic concept is missed out in this part."
"Tori-Munro","2","11","37","3 May 2014"," Too many unexpected and disappointing twists
","I must say I had high hopes when I walked into the showing of The Amazing Spider Man 2, but only for those expectations to be crushed by the confusing plot and disappointing twists. Compared to the first Amazing Spider Man, this one didn't follow any plot. The most disappointing part would be the fact the Gwen Stacy tragically died in the end out of nowhere. Not only does this disappoint the audience but it leaves a big hole in the story. The main dramatic effect in this movie was the connection between Peter and Gwen. Without the emotional connection to the characters as they try to protect each other, the movie is left dull and boring. In most movies there is one climax, the ending resolution to the movie. In this case you get the feel that it's the ending when he defeats electro, only to be shocked that there happens to be another villain who unfortunately killed Gwen in the end. Also, as you could tell from the trailer, this movie was a lot more animated then the first one. The animation of his swinging and jumping, at some points were just to much. If I wanted to watch an animated movie I would go watch Frozen."
"zachbaritone","2","11","37","3 May 2014"," Spidey vs. 'Merica!
","The new Spider-Man film, while exciting and cool, is actually worse than Spider-Man 3. I am a huge fan of the Spider-Man films, but this one simply bites off more than it can chew. If we stack TASM2 (The Amazing Spider-Man 2) against CATWS (Captain America: The Winter Solider), Cap actually comes out on top. CATWS is not a perfect film. It is loud and violent, and maybe overstays its' welcome by a half hour, but it is also tighter and more focused than it's competitor. The reason Cap works so well is because it follows only one or two story arcs and sees them through until the end of the film. Only once the loose ends have been resolved does the film leave a door open for the sequel. Spidey drops breadcrumbs throughout its' bloated 140-minute running time, and actually leaves you with more questions by the end instead of answers. The effects in CATWS are more practical, with the majority of the action scenes consisting of urban warfare that would make Jason Bourne proud. Spidey's action is a bit more jarring and inconsistent. It doesn't really fit with the amusing and moving scenes with Garfield and Stone that are few and far between. While the principal actors are good in Spidey, particularly Dane DeHaan, the film sacrifices emotion at the expense of explosions. I love explosions as much as the next guy, but they have to be justified or they are just plain stupid. Cap focuses more on character development and as a result you are much more invested in the story by the time the fireworks come into play. Speaking of story, it is so much easier to summarize CATWS. A brief summary of the film would probably look like this: ""In this film Steve Rodgers confronts a corrupt government organization who is using an old friend of his as a brainwashed assassin."" Done. Comparatively, TASM2 is about ""Peter Parker's fading relationship with Gwen Stefani--I mean--Stacy, the growing conspiracy at Oscorp, the mysterious death of Peter's parents, Harry Osborne's rushed return and transformation into the Green Goblin, the completely unnecessary and ""unrelatable"" presentation of Electro--who has no justifiable motivation to kill Spider-Man, the shoehorning of The Rhino that bookends the film..."" And the list goes on and on. The problem with Spidey is that it tries to do too much and trips at the finish line. You'd think Sony would have learned their lesson after Spider-Man 3. Three villains is just too many. I also thought that Redford, Jackson, and especially Anthony Mackie were much more compelling in Captain America 2 than the characters in Spidey 2. Of course, they had more material to work with. Ultimately, TASM2 seals its' own fate by failing to take a page out of Spider-Man 3's book, and Cap 2 succeeds by going back to basics and focusing on one story that (unlike Spidey 2) is actually concluded satisfactorily in the end. Captain America: The Winter Soldier all but exceeds your expectations, but unfortunately The Amazing Spider-Man 2 just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Do yourself a favor and skip the latter."

","First of this was a pretty fantastic film Way better then Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 and way better then the Meh Amazing Spider-Man film.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man, to me, is probably the best spider man experience that any Spider Man fan can appreciate. Which is sad because this movie is going to be flat out boycotted by Disney marvel fan boys and people that only want 2 see hardcore action films. <br/><br/>The Movie was more Astonishing then Amazing, the acting was solid and really felt like it came out of the pages of an Amazing Spider Man comic book, the witty one liners, the fast snappy dialog just brilliant. Andrew Garfield again brings and presents to us a believable, more human, Peter Parker full of wit and charm, Andrew Garfield is spider man he was just amazing and Gwen played by Emma Stone was again spectacular, the romance between the 2 was superbly portrayed and very believable, you could really feel the love the two had for each other. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon/Electro was brilliant, i really felt sorry for the guy, i know that feeling of not having people care or acknowledge you, it hurts, and the Green Goblin, Terrifying, jeezz Dan DeHann just gave me the creeps. The visuals were beautiful the visual vibe from the camera was great again it felt very much from a comic book, Cgi at times was superb and then kinda drops in some parts. The only real things that really annoyed me was probably the fact that the Films pasting is Off, and the villains are just not used enough which is a shame, I blame the Rhino, the films worst character, hes not even a Goddamn side character, hes not even a real plot device, HES JUST GODDAMN THEIR. those 2 are really my only big gripes with the film, i found it way more enjoyable and entertaining then the Avengers, Hulk, Daredevil, Thor, Irom Man 2 and 3 and the Original Captian America film, i was just fantastic cant wait 2 see what they do with the next film also what makes u Disney Marvel fan boys believe that Disney would do Spider-Man justice i don't think it would make a difference Marvel Disney Villains are a lot weaker then what we got in The Amazing spider man 2 besides Captain America's The Winter Solider and Lokki"
"pootc","8","6","17","19 April 2014"," The best rendition of Spiderman yet!
","The relationship between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) has infinitely more chemistry than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst which is why The Amazing Spiderman series is superior to the previous Sam Raimi helmed version of Spiderman. The supporting cast notably Jamie Foxx as Max/ Electro, Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborne and also Sally Field and Aunt May are excellent in their respective roles – and also much more fleshed out then usual. Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to slow down the pace and tell a human story while leaving plenty of time for action. While the first Amazing Spiderman was an origin story and more grounded in action scenes Amazing Spiderman 2 pulls out all the stops and looks absolutely fantastic. The strength and chemistry of the lead two characters is the real gem here though striking an emotional chord while the action climaxes in an epic and unforgettable finale. Amazing Spiderman 2 is a rousing success, topping the first in this series and leaving us wanting more. The best rendition of Spiderman yet!"
"pierce-declase","8","6","17","19 April 2014"," Electro is awesome!
","For me this is the best Spiderman movie out. Lets tell you why.<br/><br/>The story line is nothing special but its a good one, we get more on peters dad, also his best friend/ worst rival Harry Osborn is involved which is cool. The new villain Electro adds to the story. Is spiderman fighting the bad guys while trying to balance his life between being spierman and Peter Parker. There are some cool little scenes in that that shows you how both affect his life. <br/><br/>For me but i loved Electro, his powers were so awesome! The graphics are amazing and the way he looked was sick. I thought he was a good villain in this story. The green goblin also was the beginning of him. You can tell with this spiderman that its a good story but also a setting up in this renewed spiderman series. <br/><br/>Spiderman himself is way cooler than he was in the other trilogy. His funny and much more punky in this one, which i like a lot more. <br/><br/>This movie is a good movie a really good one, nothing special but why does it have to be, its a good movie which i would definitely watch again. So if your not doing anything or wondering if you should watch this movie, please go watch it. Its worth and you can tell so much more is to come!"
"iamspiderman2976","10","7","21","6 May 2014"," A great film but it seems as though it had a mediocre script . But marc webb , his cast , and co save it
","Well heres what i think of the amazing spider man 2 . I,ll start with the cons . Okay the movies pacing a better than its predecessor , but still it moves from being fast as heck to being slow too much . Next the movie is a bit crowded with characters and subplots . Now on too the pros first the movie has great performances , except for Paul giamatte he just acts like a goof ball . Andrew is amazing and Emma stone is great . Jamie Foxx really makes you feel for max but it loses its sympathy once he gets lost in the 1,000 plots . Dane dehann in my opinion did an amazing job , that kid can act . He be pathetic and terrifying at the same time . Sally field is great and Chris cooper has one scene as Norman and his presence is chilling . Next the film has unique tone i thought , the movie has some really funny moments i enjoyed , there kinda awkward though . But the movie also has this very dark drama in it . And in my opinion it balances well , although i think the drama outweighs the humor . Next the directing by Marc Webb is solid enough , im surprised he was able to cram this much into the movie . The action scenes are top notch . They are much more exciting than the first films . The score by hanz zimmer is very contemporary but amazing , it fits what they were going for very much . And it doesn't feel all generic and uninspired like horners score for the last film . Over all i loved the amazing spider man 2 , even though it feels a bit bloated its still very good . I've seen terrible super hero films (steel,superman 4, cat women , and batman and robin .) this isn't bad by any means in my opinion ."

I mean, I like the new version of spider man i find it more realistic, I liked peter and how he added a great sense of humour to the character. even Gwen and Harry they were great."

","To start with a good point, the effects are good and Jamie Foxx's electric villain is cool.

But their chemistry is convincing. Dane De Haan looks sickly enough, which the role requires.<br/><br/>As far as superhero stories are concerned, this one was weak even by those low standards.

"drqshadow-reviews","4","4","10","27 July 2015"," Too Intent on Building a Franchise, ASM2 Forgot to be a Film
","A confused, overstuffed follow-up effort that's strangely empty, given the classic stories inside. *ASM2* plays like a very good, well-intentioned script that was watered down and padded by too many cooks in the producers' kitchen. That leads to a rough, inconsistent tone, which often parades directly from one plucky bit of light banter straight into a dark, brooding, heavy plot development, then back again. Imagine if Adam West's Batman had rounded a corner in the 1960s and stumbled into Jack Nicholson's Joker parade from the first Tim Burton movie.<br/><br/>It's a wasted effort from Andrew Garfield, who's as close as we've had to a perfect rendition of the wisecracking Spidey everyone knows from the comics. His rendition of Peter Parker could still use some work, feeling a bit too ""bro"" for me, but a strong, essential bond with Emma Stone - his Gwen Stacy - smooths over most of those ruffles. Jamie Foxx is a puzzling choice as his main foil, too, in a limp-wristed role that's more pitiable than fearsome. Still, they march him out to a climactic fight scene, which rings as hollow and meaningless as the rest of his arc. More wasted acting chops.<br/><br/>The film can be a visual treat, especially when we're sailing through the skies on a zipline and Spidey's contorting his body into all manner of inhuman poses, ripped straight from the glossy covers. During the heat of battle, though, heavy doses of strobe, shakycam and jump-cuts can make it downright painful to keep up. I wanted to like this much more than I actually did. In all sorts of ways, it feels so much more authentic and grounded than the four efforts that came before, but it tries to do too much, drastically changing speeds and moods far too often. Let's start over again, I guess."

","My Review For The Amazing Spiderman 2<br/><br/>The film, like the original, feels very aimlessly structured, a mishmash collection of scenes rather than a unified whole. There's also no tonal consistency, with Webb lurching ineptly from quippy comedy to brooding drama to high tragedy in short spaces of time.<br/><br/>There just seemed to be too much emphasis on CGI rather than a compelling story, the acting was abysmal at certain points throughout, although the Marc Webb reboot is a vast improvement on the Sam Raimi trilogy, they are still a far cry from the Spider-Man movies we want, or deserve.<br/><br/>Although this movie had some incredible actors and actresses like Andrew Garfield, Dane DeHaan,Sally Field, Emma Stone and Jamie Foxx, the on screen chemistry was not what we needed for this movie, with the exception of Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield.<br/><br/>The casting choice for Rhino was horrendous even though Paul Giamatti is a fantastic actor I feel like he should have sat this one out, and even though we only got a glimpse of Paul as Rhino at the end of the movie, putting Rhino in a mech-like suit will not sit well with fans of the comic.<br/><br/>To summarise, this movie was poorly executed and was a huge let down from Jamie Foxx as Electro to the excessive CGI, if I was to rate this movie out of ten, I'd give it a solid 4.5."

It reeks of cliché, poor directing, cheesy dialog, good awful villains and unconvincing plot.<br/><br/>Movie is a roller coaster going from cringe to funny and fun in 2 minutes of the same scene. The only thing that works is the relationship between Peter and Stacy but this is mostly due to a real life romance between Andrew and Emma.<br/><br/>And then that ending... It was good. Final scene between Peter and Stacy was full of emotion, well directed and sudden. Then I was like: ""Oh finally the movie is getting better, dark and interesting"" Gwen's death is in my opinion the best scene in all Spider-man movies. But THEN instead of finishing it right there with Peter standing above her grave which was a powerful scene, director decides that spider-man should come back in a cliché way like nothing happened and just take a dump on the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>I'm confused and angry. I want my whole movie to be good, not just last 20 minutes. God damn it Sony... Please give up on milking this franchise and sell it to some talented studio or we will never see a truly amazing spider-man.<br/><br/>In short, cheesy movie that keeps reminding you of wasted talent.

"jackbanister16","5","4","10","26 August 2014"," Nope. This reboot series stinks.
","I'll keep this one short.<br/><br/>We are talking about a reboot of a series. Usually that would suggest improvement upon things that were glossed over in the originals (Sam Raimi flicks). These first two movies in the ""Amazing"" Spiderman have been anything but that. They have been bloated, relatively humorless, and lacking interesting action scenes. <br/><br/>I liked the actor and the setup for Harry Osborne, but him becoming ""The Green Goblin,"" was pretty weak. He just puts on armor and all of the sudden is the Green Goblin. At least the Raimi flick developed that over a good amount of time despite its flaws. <br/><br/>The Rhino was ridiculous...Instead of closing the curtain on the movie a few minutes early, we have to sit through a boring and unimaginative fight scene with Paul Giamatti (wtf?) as a Ukranian gangster. Lame. <br/><br/>Is it just me or were the effects terrible? This looked more like a cartoon than a real movie. I won't even go into Electro. Not a good showing. It looks like a movie from early 2000's. <br/><br/>Script is light on meaningful dialogue or ""themes"" that Spiderman usually provokes. It's a pretty hollow script that just does the bare minimum to be considered a ""plot."" <br/><br/>Although it's not a good movie either, I liked the first ""Amazing Spiderman"" way better than this movie. This one has a bad case of sequel-itis...It just stinks. <br/><br/>I got bored about halfway through the movie, but watched it to get my money's worth."

","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as Spiderman is at it again, this time fighting off 3-new villains that threaten New York City: Electro (Jaime foxx), The Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) and Rhino (Paul Giamatti). Then as Peter, he has to be a good boyfriend to Gwen (Emma Stone), please his Aunt May (Sally Field) and tell his best friend Harry (DeHaan) that Spiderman cannot give his blood to help save his (Harry's) life as that could kill him. Where does he find the time? Inquiring Minds want to know. <br/><br/>Here we go again. How they can do another ""2"" is confusing since they have already had ""3."" Go Figure. Must be the newer Math. Anyway.. (Hey, it's all in the spelling). Okay. <br/><br/>Most of us have heard the saying: ""there is nothing new under the sun."" Well, that is not entirely true. CGI is new under the sun and we see it all the time in movies. This movie revels in CGI (the 10-yr olds love it) and yes, it is fantastic, but truth be told when it goes on for too long we become sleepy. And, yes, it went on for too long too many times. See? Actually, the entire movie went on for too long. <br/><br/>There were too many scenes that seemed like the dialogue was dubbed in (unless you had a bad DVD) and it was so distracting I had to rewind to see what I missed. Turns out the dialogues were so lame, I didn't miss anything. Also those dialogues between Peter and Aunt May and Peter and Gwen early in the movie was amateurish and basically silly. They leveled out later on. <br/><br/>But, make no mistake, this is basically a love story between Peter and Gwen with Spiderman swinging all over and fighting the villains when he has the time. Coming up later on there will be a very big surprise and you may not like it. Yes, this will be the new thing. <br/><br/>One would NOT think that an Oscar nomination could come out of a Spiderman movie, but I believe that Sally Field as Aunt May deserves one for Best Supporting Actress. She was very good. Another Oscar nomination could be for the CGI and the 10-year olds agree. <br/><br/>Although Paul Giamatti, as Rhino, didn't have much screen time, I believe he had the time of his life and enjoyed his stint. You go, Paul! You did good. <br/><br/>I know they will do another Spider-Man movie in 2018 and if my sock drawer doesn't need reorganizing, I might watch it, or maybe not. I am coming to believe there is no Pull for me in these Spiderman movies; they are the same thing over and over and over.. The only Pull is the CGI and the 10-year olds can't wait. I can.

","I thought when they were rebooting Spiderman it was with the intent of making better movies, not whatever you would call this crap. Very good special effects, but it seems that is why this movie was created. The story is a crap-burger with a side of puke-fries. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is awful, and his character is terrible. Logic & reason evade this movie at every turn. Without spoiling anything, the idiocy starts from the very beginning. The movie asks you to suspend belief too much for even a superhero movie. Avatar was more believable.. and I know you don't see these types of movies for their ability to be based in reality, but this one is just ridiculous. <br/><br/>The only thing amazing about this movie is that it sets up the third installment to be even worse."
"cosmo_tiger","5","4","10","17 August 2014"," To me Spider-man has always been a little too angsty and cheesy for me. This movie did nothing to change my view.
","""You're wrong about us being on different paths, we're not on different paths. You're my path and you're always gonna be my path."" Peter (Garfield) is realizing that keeping his promise of staying away from Gwen (Stone) harder then he expected. Saving the city is still easy for him though. After Norman, the head of Oscorp dies and his son Harry is forced out villain after villain is created and Spider-man faces threats both physically and emotionally. I have to begin be saying that I have never been a big Spider-man fan. When it comes to comic book movies I like the darker ones like Batman and the newest X-Men series. To me Spider-man has always been a little too angsty and cheesy for me. This movie did nothing to change my view. This movie dealt more with the relationship between Gwen and Peter then Spider-man vs. bad guys. For some people that may be OK but I am also not a fan of teenage love- dramas. Jamie Foxx was good in this as usual but he also seemed wasted, like they just wanted a big name actor for a bad guy and he was put into a role beneath his talent. My biggest complaint was the main reason I wanted to see this was for Paul Giamatti. He is one of the best and most underrated actors around today. Not to spoil anything but he is in the movie for about 3 minutes total. Car chase in the beginning and a scene at the end that served no other purpose then to set up a third movie. All that said though I again am not a Spider-man fan. If you like him you will like this movie, if you don't then like me you probably won't. Overall, a cheesy comic book movie that was basically Gwen and Peter break up, Spider-man scene, they get back together, Spider-man scene, they break up, Spider-man scene...over and over. To me this was just long and hard to care about. I do think that fans will love this though. I give this a C+."

"phubbs","5","4","10","4 August 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","The Spider-Man is back and this time he's got a new villain to fight! The same complete principle yet again but...a different villain, or two...wash rinse and repeat. The inevitable third film will obviously see Spider-Man back fighting another entirely new villain yet exactly the same thing will happen all over again...but glossier.<br/><br/>OK so we know the plot (see above) but let me start by saying one thing, this film was totally a Schumacher inspired vision if ever I saw one. Case in point, the entire plot and character development for Electro. Man I couldn't believe how daft gimmicky and clichéd this guy was, its like Webb literately watched 'Batman Forever' and thought it would be a good route to follow. Foxx plays the stereotypical cookie cutter comicbook type geek with goofy teeth and glasses because that must obviously mean the guy is academic. Just like Schumacher's Riddler vision Dillon loves Spidey in a creepy stalker-ish kinda way, but due to an accident that borders on Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin' offering, he gets transformed into a living electric generator, cunningly calling himself Electro.<br/><br/>'They should call you the amazing Spider-Man'<br/><br/>Now I gotta moan about this character because he's the central villain yet his entire plot development makes no sense. Why is he so mad at everybody? why does he try to kill hundreds of Gotham citizens...oops! I mean New York citizens. Are you trying to tell me that his whole reason for being a rampaging villain is simply because Spidey didn't pay attention to him and neither did anyone else?? he basically has thrown a complete hissy fit over not getting any attention?! Does this really enrage him so much that he decides to kill Spidey (despite him saving his life), lots of innocent people and blackout New York city?! Jesus bananas! well I guess he's ready for the Arkham Asylum, although I suppose that would tie in with comicbook bad guys in general lore. Oh and where the hell did he get that super-villain suit??! the super-villains R' Us superstore!<br/><br/>This leads me to the other villain which we see for around five minutes...Rhino. Why is this guy here? because its all a setup for the 'Sinister Six' movie of course. But is this character even needed at all within this universe? the bloke is a regular guy who wears boxer shorts with cartoon rhino's on them...does this qualify him for operating the huge metal rhino mech suit which we see at the end in dodgy CGI. Why was this guy even chosen? surely it could have literately been anyone, why bother breaking him out of jail. I also don't follow how a bloke in a simple mech suit would fit in with a super-villain team, without this suit he is utterly useless, just a regular criminal. In the comics wasn't he some kind of Hulk like character? I guess a spandex rhino suit would look too daft.<br/><br/>One aspect I did like was the intro of the third villain in the form of the Green Goblin. I really thought the overall portrayal of the young Osborn by DeHaan was very good, spot on for ominous smarmy and quietly disturbing...with that greasy hairstyle. I did find myself buying into his frustration at Spidey/Parker and actually rooting for him. His Goblin alter ego was also well portrayed and well designed too, the Raimi version was a decent idea that was well crafted but I'm glad to see a more classic approach this time. Would have preferred some more goblin-esque features in there though. I thought the finale battle against Spidey was excellent and its a shame we didn't see more of that frankly, loved the glider again in this, shame we still aren't seeing any pumpkin/jack O' lantern bombs though.<br/><br/>On the whole the film is of course extremely slick and glossy visually and I'd expect nothing less. Yes Spidey looks fantastic leaping around, yes his web swinging POV sequences are truly sexy and yes the action is impressive. Problem is there isn't very much action and I did find myself getting bored for a lot of the time. The character building between Parker and Stacy is well done and its believable...but boy is it dull. I liked how we got some back story for Parker's parents although plot holes arose. Richard Parker was working with Connors from the first film on the limb regeneration project apparently...aaaaand?? should that lead into anything or am I missing something? Plus it is really extraordinarily lucky that a genetically modified spider fused with Richard Parker's DNA should bite his son, seeing as the spiders are only encoded to Parker's bloodline. Of all the people a spider would bite eh.<br/><br/>I still find myself wondering what that gigantic power plant place was where Spidey fights Electro, the hell was that? looked like something outta Star Wars. I am also still confused (not being a true comicbook fanboy) at Spider-Man's powers, I know his regular powers but is he (or should he be) really as strong and powerful as say...Superman?<br/><br/>On the visual side this movie is solid no doubt, each comicbook movie just gets better and better, but this is far from a solid movie overall. I found it quite dull for the most part, a terrible soundtrack and score which didn't fit with most scenes, another obligatory hideous hip hop track over the end credits, more Lee cameos, a God awful self referential gag with the old Spidey theme tune and quite frankly a stunning leap backwards in the terms of comicbook movie progression because the film is basically a super slick Schumacher adaptation with all the same childish quirks. Crazy cackling evil German scientists with heavy accents torturing Electro in a laboratory full of flashing neon lights and whirring sounds? I'm surprised no one had nipples on their super suits.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Despite a fairly strong last 30 minutes and a moving scene or two from Sally Field and Andrew Garfield, The Amazing Spider Man 2 is disappointing. The script is poorly written, some characters are agonizingly cliché and it's just way too cheesy. Throw in the overly cartoonish special effects and the fact that the talents of Paul Giamatti and Jamie Foxx *are completely wasted* with poorly constructed characters, this is just not worth watching. The bar for great comic book films has been raised so high recently with movies like the Nolan Batman trilogy, the X-Men reboots and even this year's Captain American: The Winter Soldier.

"TheLittleSongbird","5","4","10","30 July 2014"," Impressive spectacle but overstuffed and empty
","Both Amazing Spider-Man films get a lot of hate, and while for me they weren't as bad as all that(if anything personally they were moderately enjoyable films) I do agree with a lot of the criticisms for both. Some say the sequel is better, personally the first while being very over-familiar and unevenly paced and with a severely underdeveloped villain the first was a little better but still fell far short. There are good things about the sequel. Once again it is very stylishly made and the special effects are better this time round, while the action sequences provide some thrills. The chemistry between Peter and Gwen is still sweet, Peter at the grave is actually quite moving and the closest the film ever gets to having any emotional impact and some of the acting is good. Andrew Garfield's performance is much better here, he doesn't ever quite capture Spider-Man's vulnerability but he is much less smug and tones down the quirkiness. Emma Stone is a charming and very likable Gwen, Sally Field gives seasoned support as Aunt May although she doesn't have much to do and Dane DeHaan does a great job showing Harry Osborn's slow descent into fear and loneliness. However, Jamie Foxx despite looking really cool doesn't do anything with Electro and looks lost and Paul Giamatti is completely wasted and gives a rare bad performance. The script and the way the characters are written don't help, the script is very thinly sketched and tries to balance comedy and pathos and does so awkwardly, to the extent the comedy feels overly-broad and out of place and the pathos apart from one part is non-existent literally. And the film does suffer from too many characters and most of them with little development, with the two leads the most interesting characters. There are two too many villains(the same problem that Spider-Man 3 had) and none of them developed very well, Osborn/Green Goblin just about musters due to DeHaan but his development still feels rushed and some of his actions out of the blue, the villain also deserved a much better resurrection which was cheaply done. Like Lizard in the first film Electro is very one-dimensional with no motivation, or shall we say no obvious one, and Rhino feels like a just-there-for-the-sake-of-it character. The story doesn't suffer from being over-familiar like the first Amazing Spider-Man but it does suffer from a very sprawling structure and a lot of it feels over-stuffed and plodding. The music has its moments and does fit better than James Horner's for the first Amazing Spider Man but it does lack pace and one of those pleasant-to-listen-to-but-easily-forgettable scores, three composers are credited and the score sometimes sounds like that is the case. All in all, moderately enjoyable and visually impressive, and Garfield is much more at ease here, but it does suffer from trying to do too much and feels empty and emotionally-lacking. 5/10 Bethany"

","Oh gosh I don't even know where to begin. I thought the previous spider man was boring but I figured I'd watch this one because of the awesome previews and Jamie Foxx and Paul Giamatti. Well I can honestly say that by half an hour into the movie I was looking at the exit sign in the theater and longing to walk towards it. The movie opened with a bang but the bang had no spark. It was lack luster and predictable and Spider man's whimsical and snappy comments came off as cheap Chinese kung fu voice overs. The movie dragged along at a painfully slow pace with what seemed like no plot or direction. I think I dozed off twice. I honestly felt like I was watching a soap opera.<br/><br/>Foxx's character was pretty cool as electro thanks to CGI but he wasn't really formidable. He sort of retained his geeky loser qualities as electro. Giamatti's character as the rhino was awesome and formidable but a dimwit. He came off like some kind of Russian rodeo circus clown. I know the end of this almost 3 hour long melodrama was trying to prepare us for a part three but I will for sure listen to my gut this time and skip it. Like I should have done this one. 4 stars solely for the cool CGI."

There was barely any time to build Harry Osborn up at all. And one character was introduced as himself then the villain.

"Fluke_Skywalker","6","4","10","3 May 2014"," Not so amazing
","Like it's predecessor, ironically named director Marc Webb's 'Amazing-Spider-Man 2' is a very frustrating film. There are a number of really good ideas, scenes and performances, but they're all held together by an over-stuffed and under-cooked story that clunkily moves along for a mind-numbing 142 minutes. It's curious that with that much screen time Webb is unable to work in rather important aspects of Peter's life, such as going to college (which is barely even hinted at, let alone shown) or his job with the Daily Bugle.<br/><br/>Instead, the focus becomes split between the admittedly well handled love travails of Gwen and Peter and the development of two entirely new villains. Real life couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are quite good as the web slinger and his best gal, while Dean DeHaan manages to make co-villain Harry Osborne scary and sympathetic at the same time. Unfortunately his partner in crime, Jamie Foxx is horribly miscast as a milquetoast techno geek who dreams of becoming as popular and beloved as Spider-Man. Even worse is Paul Giamatti, who is downright embarrassing in a smaller role that is obviously a set-up for the next film.<br/><br/>Like the drama, the action is also polarizing. On one hand, it's over-stylized and relies too heavily on slo-mo gimmickry, but yet it's thrilling to swing along through New York city with Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Ultimately the 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is bogged down by trying to spin too many plates and undermined by a misplaced, and ultimately dissipated, focus."
"jdollak","1","12","44","5 August 2014"," How can people who don't like Spider-Man make a Spider-Man movie?
","I'm a mid-level Spider-Man fan. I've read most of the comics, at least up to the mid-90s when the continuity got harder to follow. I still follow what happens in the comics now. So I like to think that I have a handle on the character of Peter Parker.<br/><br/>What I see is a movie that was made without any consideration as to what makes Peter Parker a likable character. I'll ignore all the missteps of the first Amazing Spider-Man, and instead focus on how they messed this movie up. After Spider-Man enjoys a bit of action, he arrives in time for Peter to get his diploma. He strides onto the stage, wearing his backpack, takes his diploma, then delivers a substantial kiss with Gwen Stacy. This is not a Peter Parker that I've ever read comics about.<br/><br/>Later, Peter is transfixed by Gwen as he crosses a busy street to get to her. He steps forward and back, avoiding cars, until he just decides to hold his hand up, motioning for a truck to stop for him. Now, I know that a lot of people do this kind of thing. I think they're inconsiderate. Why is Peter like this?<br/><br/>There are two other key aspects of the movie that I think are indicative of a bigger problem. First, Gwen Stacy's death. In the comics, the direct cause of Gwen's death was uncertain. It could have been the Goblin, before she was thrown, it could have been Spider-Man's web breaking her fall. Peter isn't certain, and the uncertainty plagues him. Here, her cause of death is explicit. The script misses the point of the story.<br/><br/>The other thing is a little more abstract, and most of you won't understand, but some of you might. The planes. This is one of the most terribly done ticking-clock scenarios I've ever seen. It's clunky. Spider-Man gets no motivation out of it, since he doesn't know it's happening! The scene exists to try to force the audience to raise the tension. But why do we care about it? We don't!<br/><br/>There are a number of other problems - the storyline about Peter's parents. Aunt May becoming a nurse for some reason, Peter finding his father's secret lab. Peter's remarkably short 1.5-scene long friendship with Harry. Peter decides to retire from being Spider-Man for one whole scene, then comes back immediately. Why? This was a storyline that took a lot longer, and was developed and played out far more carefully in Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>I have lots of other complaints about this movie, but mostly, I think it boils down to this.<br/><br/>We really don't have many non-fictional heroes nowadays. Spider-Man is one of the only characters I actually can look up to. This version of Spider-Man is not a hero. He's an annoying teenager with powers, and not even a smart or nice one at that. He doesn't have heart. He doesn't feel hurt. And somehow, he's well-liked around the city. The police like him. Why should I root for this guy? Cause he gives people hope, as the movie says? No. Spider-Man isn't about giving people hope. It's about inspiring people, and showing them that doing the right thing is its own reward."
"amrenmiller","10","5","14","8 May 2014"," Don't pay any attention to the negative reviews
","This movie is jaw-droppingly amazing. The visuals and audio are stunning, to the point where you can practically feel pleasure by watching it. You could be forgiven for thinking that it can feel corny at times, but to me, they embraced the super hero feel to the point where you either reject it, or let it consume you and pull you along completely. I was pulled in. Not only that, but the action sequences are not in-your-face, like other movies. They took some of the tiniest elements and expanded them in an elaborate dynamism that is truly hard to match, and will never truly be overcome because this is the pinnacle of movie-making. Many of the scenes feel like Spider Man is in a stadium, performing for people, but the best part is that the action sequences get chopped up and slowed down to show everyone's personalities, which simply pulls you in even further. It's playful and enormously entertaining. Some people have criticized the constant music that plays in the movie, but again, if you just let yourself go and get into the movie, it pulls you along and gets you emotionally invested. The whole movie feels like an grand symphony. What else can I say about it? Incredible, just incredible. It is hard to explain, you just need to experience it."
"JontheLobsterLover","3","10","35","3 May 2014"," If a movie has to advertise as much as this one did, RUN!!
","This is a movie I was excited about when I first heard the were making it. Then you see the first trailer and the excitement builds, and that's pretty much where it stopped. They advertised the hell out of this movie, from the actors promoting it before other movies, the post office promoting it, you couldn't escape it. Just like with anything else, if you have to try so hard to get people to come, you know it's bad. <br/><br/>The first scene of the movie was one of the very few things I actually liked. Was it pulled off in very spectacular way? No, not really. What it did do though was kind of gave us (the audience) closure to what happened to Peter's parents. <br/><br/>The only other thing I liked about the movie was Electro (in a way). I actually found the scene where he get's his powers for the first time, and is actually alone, scared and confused. It brought actual life to the character which was great. Also I must add, I loved what they did with his voice. Almost like talking with a static radio voice. The parts with Electro, though not amazing, for lack of a better word, were the most interesting parts of the movie. <br/><br/>The movie itself felt way to cheesy. I like cheese in movies, but when it's done well, and not so over the top. This was just unbearable. Some scenes ended way to short. Some scenes took way to long to end. I actually found myself bored, waiting for a scene to end. I didn't like the Green Goblin/Harry Osbourne character. People are praising the actor, and I'm thinking to myself ""For what??"" He was incredibly forgettable. The score for the movie was just horrendous. When you hear a song telling Electro to kill Spiderman, umm it's getting pretty ridiculous. <br/><br/>My final gripe about the movie was Rhino's 2 minute cameo. Yes, I get it. They're setting up the next movie. Fine. Great. But that would of been much better as a post credit scene, then what you actually get. <br/><br/>I don't blame the actors at all. They are amazing amazing actors and actresses. This movie is purely the result of horrible writing and directing. <br/><br/>If you plan on seeing this movie still, well you've been forewarned."

","I really don't know where to begin. I still think the casting was perfect (except for Electro) and that Andrew Garfield is the best Spiderman in movie history. But I can't overcome the mediocre video-game graphics (let's call them CGI), the total garbage of a plot, and as the title said, the total waste of talent. I had my hopes high after the first installment but what Sony pulled off is just outrageous. Please, give back the movie rights to Marvel, or to anyone who knows what's up with everyone's favorite friendly neighborhood hero. He totally deserves at least one flawless movie. I don't even dare to dream of a flawless trilogy at this point. I just saw my childhood being raped for two and a half hours. Thank you Sony...I kindly ask you to forget to make another movie based on Spiderman."
"MrSirBossMan","1","10","36","14 May 2014"," Big Spidey Fan, Bad Movie
","I, myself am a big Spider-Man fan. However, this movie does not do the hero and comics justice. I believe it was a waste of money because of all the plot mistakes it had. From simple things like Electro not wearing a costume and instead being made of electricity to messing up characters and making them the wrong villains. The ""impressive"" cgi was really nothing special and took away from the one thing that makes Spider-man movies fun to watch; the web-swinging. There are only two three second burst of seeing Spidey doing his sky-high parkour and they consist of him swinging to the roof of another building before it cuts to more bad plot. (i.e Harry going power crazy) Lastly, the acting is obviously bad, with Garfield's imitation of a New York Teen being very stereotypical and sometimes hinders some of Spider-Man's best quotes. This movie was obviously a ploy to earn quick money by Sony. Please sell the royalties to someone else."

Even the part when Peter is mourning his girlfriend after she's dead is longer than all the battle scenes all combined. That's the first time I get that bored in a movie, I almost fell asleep at the theater.. The script is lame!

"bob the moo","Null","3","7","1 November 2014"," Some good aspects but mostly poorly delivered in a rushed and messy film (SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS)
","I'm not sure why I ended up watching this film since I didn't think they did anything good with the first rebooted film – but I think it did help that I was coming into the film with low expectations. It is disappointing then that even low expectations seemed hardly able to be met. It did not have to be this way; the film has interesting aspects, good aspects and clearly more than enough money than it needs to do what it wants to do. The problem is that it seems to have so much it does what to do that in the end it does none of them well.<br/><br/>I don't know what it is with these films that they need to have so many villains and so much going on, but it is a negative in this case. The plot is bloated and has this stuttering feeling where no matter what it is doing in that moment, it feels like it wants to be doing something different (which it usually does within a minute or two). This ruins a lot of what might have been good. The relationship side is actually nicely done but is not given the time to really be what it needs to be; it is superficial despite the efforts of the lead two actors, and what might have been seen as a brave narrative twist in the later stages is actually horribly misjudged and wasted as it rushes from the key scene into the next bit. This applies to the smaller characters as well – we have no interest in them apart from being able to use them – so the rush is on just to get them to the stage where they are special effects. Electro/Max is one of the best example of this since he is really a tragic figure full of humanity but yet hurt and anger – the film shows us this but then does nothing with it whatsoever. Same with Osborn, the background of Parker's family, and many other details – although of course the total waste of a brave twist involving Gwen is probably the hardest to see.<br/><br/>Visually the film has a lot going on but yet it matters so little. Some of the effects are really too computer-generated for their own good, while too many big scenes are just too big and noisy – rather than drawing the viewer into them, they are aggressive in pushing the viewer away instead. As a result I found it almost tiring that there was so many big scenes but yet I cared so little; the overused slow-motion stuff detracted more than it added and generally I found little of merit beyond excessive spectacle. The cast are mostly lost in the middle of this and the good work many of them do is just wasted. Garfield and Stone are good, but the film doesn't let them build this and when it really gives Garfield something to do, it moves on immediately like it was nothing. Foxx and DeHaan are both capable of so much more and indeed the tragic base of their characters is interesting, but soon enough they are just people jumping around on a greenscreen set.<br/><br/>A third film is on the way and I'm sure on a plane or a wet afternoon or some other dead time, I'll put it on because it demands no effort from my side to watch it. I wish it was not this way but the second of the rebooted Spider-Man films holds out aspects which are good and could have been so much better – but instead loses them with no focus, too much of a rush, and too much stuff trying to be crammed in so it has really no room to breathe."
"david-himmelein","Null","3","7","23 May 2014"," Worst Spiderman movie yet...
","This movie was horrible. First of all, yes i am a little biased because i prefer Spiderman to have biological webs versus the home made ones in this version, which brings me to my first point. How does he afford these. It says in the first one that these are from Oscorp so he makes a hooter for them. Great. So we are to believe he is just buying these from Oscorp and no one has noticed their high-tensile strength line is the same thing Spiderman uses on a daily basis? <br/><br/>Secondly,. how much power does a high schooler have? Gwen Stacey just say oh yeah I know how to shut down the power grid, no problem. Everything else has no power but good thing this one controller does. Backup generators all over the city are failing but this one thing works. Awesome. <br/><br/>Third, Aunt May says at one point that she has to take nursing classes to afford to be able to put Peter trough college. What? She has to pay to take classes so she can pay for Peter too? This is not a good short term plan. <br/><br/>Mostly my hatred of this movie lies in the overall story. this just was not a believable comic book movie and i love almost all of the comic book based movies that have come out in the past 10 years or so. This Peter Parker is not the shut out nerd we all love but more like the Emo- Cool nerdish type which is a complete departure from the comics. If you are a Marvel fan then go see this just for the sake of seeing it but I would wait until Netflix or something to do it. Hopefully if they go a third one, it will be much better than this trash. Instead go see Captain America 2, that is worth your time and money to see."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","3","7","22 May 2014"," Enjoyable outing, but overdone in the multiple finales
","I won't start this review by harping on again about the tired nature of Marvel/DC 're-imaginings' of the more popular elements of their respective portfolios - (if you want a recap of this particular rant, see my review of last year's Man of Steel at http://wp.me/p3bNxg-bJ ).<br/><br/>Actually, the first film of this reboot series was pretty good: much less earnest and quirkier than the original Tobey Maguire series, and revelling more in the fun to be had around a superhero's schooldays. The finale of that film saw police chief Stacey - father of his girlfriend Gwen Stacey - make Spidey swear with his dying breath that he would stay away from Gwen in order not to put her in danger. So the first - very enjoyable - half of this film sees Parker (Andrew Garfield) struggling with this promise against his better hormones: she is Emma Stone after all, and he is only human! Garfield is as good in this film as in the first, bringing a depth of feeling and emotion to the role of the split-personality Parker/Spidey, caught between his duty and his feelings. And he has real chemistry with Stone: the couple are genuinely funny together and she looks just drop-dead gorgeous.<br/><br/>There was a suggestion in the run up to this film's release that there would be only one main villain: a key learning from the true awfulness that was Spiderman 3. They lied. There are two main villains in this flick - two and a half if you count 'Rhino man'. (Seriously, anyone who has recently spectated at the London Marathon couldn't take this villain seriously... I certainly wanted to chant ""Rhino, Rhino, Rhino..."" at that bit).<br/><br/>But I digress. The two primary villains of the piece are Electro, played rather well, in nerdy-janitor mode at least, by Jamie Foxx and The Green Goblin, played by up-and-coming star Dane DeHaan, whose first memorable movie appearance was as the kid-with-superpowers in the sleeper hit ""Chronicle"" from 2012. DeHaan has such a memorably strange and mesmerising face - somewhat reminiscent of the intensity of a young Leo DiCaprio - that his transformation into the leering Green Goblin is genuinely memorable.<br/><br/>However, my main gripe with the second half of this film is that there is just too much going on. Both of these villains are quite good, but both together are complete overload (or in the case of Electro, over-voltage). Having two and a half villains means that there are two and a half finales to work your way through. And it's pointless: one of these main villains would have been fine and dandy, so save the other one to live another day until The Amazing Spider-Man 3. Less is more Hollywood! Given the choice, I would have ditched the rather ridiculous Electro ending and kept the 'Goblin in the bell-tower' scene. Whilst curiously reminiscent of a certain Keaton/Nicholson finale in the first Batman film, the ending - where Spidey falls for Gwen Stacey in a wholly different kind of way - is both thrilling and shocking in equal measure.<br/><br/>So - in my view a game of two halves: first half 8/10, second half 6/10.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other film reviews and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"" at bobmann447.wordpress.com.

"NJRocker091188","7","3","7","3 May 2014"," The Mediocre Spider-Man
","""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was not what I had thought it would be. Though I did like the movie, it was just a little bit of a let down. It was not the Amazing Spider-Man when compared to the 2012 reboot film. It's more a long the lines of The Mediocre Spider-Man. The movie has a lot of good moments but, there are some issues with this film.<br/><br/>One of the problems with this movie really is redundancy when it comes to Peter's relationship with Gwen Stacy. They are on again, they are off again, then they are on again, and all they do is bicker. This of course is a example of bad writing.<br/><br/>Another issue with this movie is the set of villains. Here we are again with three villains just as we had with ""Spider-Man 3."" However, it is not that there are three villains that is a problem, it is that they got squashed. The Green Goblin makes an appearance but, he is only in it for about 10 minutes. We spend a lot of time building up his character and we do not get much screen time with him as a villain just as we had with venom in ""Spider-Man 3."" The only difference is that he does not get killed off.<br/><br/>It is clear that Goblin was just introduced as a villain for a future film yet to come. The Rhino played by Paul Giamatti makes an appearance at the end but, sadly, it is for no good reason at all expect to give Spider-Man a reasoning to come back into action after the death of Gwen.<br/><br/>Despite some of the issues with this film, there is a lot that I liked. Max Dillon/ Electro was the highlight of the movie. His make up, voice, music theme, and effects where all well done, including his character development. Jamie Foxx plays the character well. Max is smart but, absolutely insane. When he first becomes Electro he is scared at first, and then finds that he really likes his power. The fight scenes where really good, and they make up for the lack of fight scenes in the first Marc Webb direct film.<br/><br/>Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn may have had a short appearance as his alter ego The Green Goblin however, he does play his part well. He makes for a great Harry Osborn and his character is also developed pretty well. This film also makes up for the lack of ""The Untold Story"" as the recent film was advertised to be. We learn a lot more of the secretes behind Peter Parke's Dad, his involvement with OsCorp, and the corruption of the company. There is also a lot humor in the film as well. After all, Spider-Man is supposed to be fun and entertaining. The score of the film is also a lot better, and you get this feeling that the film crew worked on it more.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a decent sequel for this rebooted trilogy, it just leaves you with the feeling of being cheated when it comes to the villains."

","To start of with, I love superhero movies. From The Hulk to The Avengers, form Batman to Spiderman. This movie though was so childish that I expect most adults will be unable to see it through. The whole movie felt like a teen romantic comedy with some over the top action splattered in here and there. Everything about this movie was very unconvincing, from the annoyingly hyperactive Peter Parker to Jamie Foxx as villain to car chases that seemed to come out of some teenage adventure series. I had enough after 45 minutes and believe me I have only ever walked out of a movie once. The next Spiderman should be made grittier and mature. Avoid this version if you're over 16!"

I'm not sure who the blame, the director or Andrew Garfield for his poor performance. There was no plot, no emotions, no ""beat down then come up,"" nothing.<br/><br/>All I saw was a cocky version of Spiderman, nothing else. There are hardly any action scenes, and the ones included are very poorly made. Andrew Garfield cannot compared to Tobey Maguire as Spiderman. It's like comparing an ant to a lion. Hopefully Andrew will be able to give a better performance in his upcoming movies. Sorry, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen."
"CowherPowerForever","4","9","32","4 May 2014"," The Awful Spider-Man 2
","This review of the Amazing spider-Man 2 will in fact contain heavy spoilers. So if you do not want to be spoiled, do not read anymore of this review.<br/><br/>Two years ago Marc Webb rebooted Spider-Man with his Amazing Spider-Man film. While I thought the film was just barely over average, for many reasons, I thought for sure it would lay groundwork for this sequel to be better. The trailers for this film have been average to good from the start. So I wasn't expecting much going into the theater. Having low expectations going in I thought for sure I would like it more than the first film. Nope, turns out this was was even worse than the first film.<br/><br/>The story is downright bad. The movie starts out explaining a little bit of what happened to Peter's parents. As in the first movie we are told they die in a plane crash, which is true, and the film starts out by showing us what in fact happened on that flight. Well the awful story starts there. That scene on the plane is a giant cliché. It is your typical action scene on a plane. Nothing at all exciting about it. I thought the character development, much like the first film, was actually pretty good. Although the development of Harry Osborn/Green Goblin was very weak, even weaker for Goblin. Speaking of weak character development, you cannot talk about that unless you mention Aleksei Sytsevich, aka Rhino, played by Paul Giamatti. Not even the great Giamatti could save this loosely written character. He gets very little screen time, not developed at all, and worst of all, his battle with Spider-Man we see in the trailers where Spider-Man is throwing around that man hole cover, well that battle scene ends the film in the exact same way we see it in the trailers. Yep, you read that correctly. The ending is literally in the trailers. Very very sloppy. Not to overshadow those glaring potholes in the film, we then can turn our attention to the Gwen and Peter 80s romantic comedy storyline, which takes up a large portion of the film. I have no problem expanding of their relationship, but when you force scenes with them two, that is just being sloppy. So finally in closing for the writing and story, in my opinion you will not find much of a worse story than in this film right here.<br/><br/>Back for a second round, director Marc Webb delivers us some good actions scenes here and there as he does like to shoot some action scenes without CG. However the CG scenes are downright silly. It truly looks like a video game. For example the final battle scene with Electro and Spider-Man was impossible to take seriously. I understand CG was needed in a battle scene like this, but with a massive production budget of nearly 250 million dollars, you would think the CG would be top notch. The acting overall for the most part was actually fairly good. I think the actors connected pretty good together. I just think the characters were written so badly that the acting was in this box, and it couldn't exceed that level.<br/><br/>Composed by the legendary Hans Zimmer, with help from Pharrell Williams. Now I thought the score for the first film was average to bad at times. This score at times was intense. I thought Williams and Zimmer connected well with some of the scenes they scored. Especially the Times Square scene with Electro. Then at other times I thought it was terrible, and they just kept pushing in trendy music from today. Much like the music Williams usually writes and produces. So much like the first film, the score is nothing special.<br/><br/>Overall this was truly one of the worst superhero films I have ever seen. I have probably seen all the superhero films since the big resurgence in the early 2000s when the first Spider-Man was released, and this sequel to the rebooted Spider-Man film takes the cake for one of the worst films in the genre. Frankly I cannot recommended anyone actually go out and pay to see this film. Though I also recognize the hardcore superhero fans will still see the movie no matter what.<br/><br/>2/10"
"jksnxia","10","6","19","7 May 2014"," This is how you make a great super hero movie.
","I feel like the director went the Les Miserables approach with this movie, which is absolutely fantastic. What I most admired about Les Miserables and this movie, is that it creates the atmosphere and scenery for so many situations. In other words, within 2 hours, you felt the uneasiness of a breakup, the depression of loneliness, the butterfly stomach of a love scene on top of a bridge in the sunset, the crave of attention and/or being wanted, the uprising feelings or being hopeful and so so so much more. A movie where you have control over all aspects of life and the job of the director is to put the audience into the characters' shoes and into the movie. Absolutely fantastic job on that, Mark Webb.<br/><br/>There are also many little detailed moments that are entirely unnecessary for the plot, but add so freaking much more meaning and symbols for us to analyze, and the thing about these details is that it doesn't impact the way we film fanatics look at the movie, but also the general audience. Like that little boy who was bullied but eventually became the only one in the city brave enough to stand up to a monster, who else felt like oh my god so powerful? Another one would be the electronic music bit in the middle of an epic fight scene. It is super enjoyable for the general audience, but you can also take it as what other people may despise, like the type of music or that character, is music to someone else's ear. Or when peter was meeting Gwen to ""be just friends"" and how he passed the traffic and being completely unable to take his eyes off her. I honestly can't think of anymore off the top of my head but there are also little witty details that just perfectly fit spider-man's style like Gwen telling the cab driver to stop the car when they were already stopped in traffic and ugh cant think of anymore again dang it.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the storyline. Geez. Crosscutting between multiple events is kinda common in TV series and in some movies. But here, all events are eye-grabbing and eventually play a huge role in affecting Spiderman and/or the audience. I mean that random added bit of the two intersecting planes? That is an obvious victim of the loss of electricity that we might never think of because it doesn't relate to most of us. This ties to the two points I mentioned above because it is like a super mini sub-movie that we just watched of how two full planes of passengers escaped the grasp of Death and it didn't affect the storyline but added so much more intensity. The story progression overall is super smooth and keeps the audience's attention.<br/><br/>The fight scenes. Amazing. I mean you do have to get creative when one puny spidery figure is fighting all these unusual and powerful villains. You'd think it would get old that it would just be spidery shooting webs everywhere but Na, Na, never once did I feel something was overdone. I would only complain about how Harry's fight scene was too short since most parts of the movie was a buildup to his anger aside from electro- dood.<br/><br/>Another bone that I have to pick with this movie is that sometimes it got too unrealistic. For one, spider man got shocked full blast by the entire power plant which was powerful enough to kill an electric monster, yet he was still able to get up and even have another intense fight? come on. or what kind of locking mechanism would be activated when you kick a stone wall hard enough to pop a whole laboratory train out of the floor, which even opens its doors for you lol.<br/><br/>In terms of mise en scene, there were a couple that I noticed but I have to admit, it really kept my focus on the storyline ha ha. First of all there were a bunch of dutch angles that I'm not entirely sure if they were a stylistic choice or really had something else going on: that one shot though, where his aunt was about to tell peter all she knew about his dad, peter bent down to match her eye level and that twisting shot, oh ho ho. Another one is when peter was finding out the truth about his dad and watching the video from the computer, and how much the back of the computer was taking up the frame; the reflection shots of the flashbacks of peter's old house's door through the number 26; many shots being shot through transparent planes in ""OSCORPS"" like when harry was checking the programs; when peter was listening to Gwen's voice-mail saying she got the scholarship and suddenly the extreme long shots portraying peter as so tiny and powerless; how there were always things between Gwen and peter, including the tree when they were trying to be just friends, the Chinese lanterns when they were breaking up, the police fence when peter had that ""good conversation"" with her after defeating electro-dude for the first time; harry stepping out of literally the darkness to open up to peter when they first reunited and a couple more that I can't remember right now again. The color usage was great too, subtle but super effective, like the orange warm feel when they were on top of the bridge being lovebirds.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that we are about to enter that era where analyzing film will have one extra category - special effects. Especially the 3D aspect. I think that can have a lot of potential. I'm not sure if there were any good 3D loaded cinematography in this one but I wouldn't be surprised if there were. <br/><br/>All in all in all in all in all, 10/10 amazing movie"

","Spider-man 2 surely has its own special place in almost every comic book movie fans out there, it surely is the highlight of the Spider-man trilogy, and ""Amazing Spider-man 2"" might just do the same to this franchise reboot. It may not be as iconic as Spider-man 2 because then, it was like the only comic book movie coming out of that year, and these days, we got tons of other comic book movies that come out each year. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone has never been better, not to mention how special their chemistry is. Andrew Garfield is actually the one that stands out, he somehow managed successfully bring more vulnerability to his acting, either successfully bring dramatic scenes to life or bring jokes and humor that freshens up the movie. Dane DeHaan as Harry is a perfect fit, probably a better fit than what James Franco did in the old Spidey franchise. The villains were also quite well developed, though I may say that they could've done more with electro. The entire cast was excellent, the action were great and the special effects were superbly satisfying, much improvement compared to the last one. My only complaint is probably there should've been more places for the viewers to breathe, because there were so many things happening in the movie, sometimes it felt a little bit too crowded (as anyone has expected), since they got 3 villains, so it's quite reasonable. Other than that, this movie is without question an improvement over the first movie, and what's important is that this movie brings the combination of great comic-book movie plot, fantastic action and special effects, and heart. If you're a fan of comic book movies, you WILL love this film, if you liked the old spidey movie, you will like this film, and if u liked the first Amazing Spider-man, you will love this movie even more. As a comic book movie, it's truly amazing."

","This movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. There is nothing new in the movie if u have watched the trailer already. They have revealed every f....king action scenes in the trailer itself so there is no need for anyone to watch the movie. There are too many unwanted scenes in the movie just like Godzilla, which is also one of the worst movies this year. Gareth Edwards is already in my worst directors list. Now Marc webb goes to my worst directors list. Don't waste your time and money. Go and watch Captain America or Guardians of the galaxy instead. These movies are awesome. I already watched it twice."

"irishtouristoffice","8","5","15","24 April 2014"," Great Movie - Lots of Action!
","Probably the second best spider-man movie after the great spider-man 2. The opening sequence boasts the most exciting web swinging scene to grace our cinema screen. Great villains, Jamie Foxx was particularly good as Electro and Paul Giamatti is always great though his screen time was limited. There was great chemistry between the two main characters and some lovely heartfelt moments between Peter and his Aunt May. This one had a wonderful comic book feel, re-visiting the early work of Smilin' Stan Lee with a great set up for the eventual appearance of the Sinister Six. The kids loved it, great emotion, laughs and scares. The running time shouldn't put you off either as it didn't drag at all."
"FlashCallahan","8","5","15","22 April 2014"," I hate that song....
","Having the inclusion of three villains in this sequel really had me concerned for the movie, especially seeing that the Goblin was being reintroduced so soon after the Raimi version (I know it's been 12 years, but it's really not that long ago if your at a certain age).<br/><br/>Plus it doesn't really help having the slightly fresh taste of the monstrosity that was Spider- Man 3.<br/><br/>But hey, its a new franchise, with a new spin on the web slinger, and thank heavens that the majority of people who have commented on the poorness of the film are wrong, plain wrong, but all opinions are respected.<br/><br/>The film focuses more on Peter and his demons, coming to terms with his promise that he made to captain Stacy, and the mysterious events that led to his parents murders. And then this seamlessly melds into the prerogatives of the main villain, Osborn, looking like a cross between DiCaprio, Basketball Diaries Era, and Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>Dehaans Osborn is a more sinister, gloomier version than Franco's Jock like take, and he owns the film when he is on screen. His story is the bulk of the sub plot, and he is fascinating.<br/><br/>Foxx is the weak point here, like a cross between Gus Gorman in Superman III, and the electric gremlin from The New batch. He is nothing more than a stooge for Osborn, but he does garner the greatest set piece in the film.<br/><br/>Garfield and Stone are as wonderful as expected, and his Spider-Man is just like the one from all those great cartoons of the eighties, sarcastic, human, and funny.<br/><br/>The film is a lot darker in tone, than other Marvel movies, and at sometimes, it's very touching, especially during the final showdown with Rhino.<br/><br/>The script and characterisation could have down with a little tweaking, but we are watching a film about a man who has been bitten by a radioactive spider, fighting a man made of electric, an trying to get the girl, so it's pretty much forgiven.<br/><br/>All in all, its a wonderful popcorn flick, really setting up the mood for the whole sinister six part of the franchise, and the score is brilliant, really brilliant in some places, just could of done without the Max Dillon comic relief music.<br/><br/>See it and enjoy it. It's going to be one of the biggest movies of the year."
"nateiscool10","7","5","15","21 April 2014"," Slightly better than the first..Definitely a must watch though!
","This fun, emotional, tragic, and iconic tale about Spider-Man/Peter Parker is without a doubt a must watch! But, this doesn't mean its the ""perfect"" spider-man film. The film revolves mostly around Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker's relationship through out, eventually leading to Gwen Stacy's tragic fate. This is what i've been waiting for since the announcement of Gwen Stacy in the ""Amazing Spider-Man"" franchise. Even though this story was adapted brilliantly, the plot itself i found to be kind of slow. Not as much slow, as actually clogged up. There was the story of Harry Osborn and how he was trying to live with a disease that runs in his genes, he needed Spider-Man's blood to survive, but Spider-Man refused (leading to the ""final battle"") Then we had the story of Max Dillon, an older man who is overly obsessed with Spider-Man after being saved once. When he turns into Electro, he feels betrayed by Spider- Man and goes crazy, trying to defeat Spider-Man. Even though this film had 3 villains, it doesn't mean it was anywhere near as bad as Spider-Man 3. But, the over clogged plot took away from some scenes, especially whenever you're getting into the Harry or Max scenes, this is where a random Peter and Gwen scene would come in. Moving on from the negatives, there were also many positives! Like i said earlier, the story was BRILLIANT! The action, the visuals, and the score beat the first film by miles! Hans Zimmer's new theme was magnificent, and i didn't think he would have been able to top Horner's theme. Overall, though ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" had a clogged up plot,the film had amazing acting, spectacular visuals, and an ultimate soundtrack! In conclusion, i would give ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" a 7/10."
"johnboyjunior","7","5","15","17 April 2014"," A solid movie
","As someone who really enjoyed the first Amazing Spider-man movie I was really looking forward to this and I can safely say its a good movie, not brilliant but good.<br/><br/>The movie opens by showing us what happened to Peters parents after they left him with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>The first glimpse we get of spider-man is as he is free falling through the air in response to the sounds of sirens chasing after a hijacked truck carrying highly radioactive materials. The CGI is incredible and Spider-man has never looked better. Although the actual chase scene isn't anything you haven't seen before. There are some quite funny moments with Spidey trying to collect vials in the back of a moving truck being driven by Paul Giamatti and Peter talking to Gwen on the phone.<br/><br/>Speaking of, Paul Giamatti is awful. Miscast would be an understatement, he is utterly terrible. He is over the top and his accent his ridiculous. I predict a Razzie nomination for him in this role. Thankfully his role is very minimal. Which surprised me, as I was expecting Rhino to play a larger part.<br/><br/>Jamie Fox doesn't quite fit here either. He plays an Oscorp employee who just wants people to take notice of him and develops a slight infatuation with Spider-man after he saves him. There is a very cringe inducing scene where Jamie Fox's character has an imaginary conversation with Spider-man. It actually reminded me of Jim Carey's rather over the top portrayal of Edward E. Nigma in Batman Forever. Im not sure which is worse.<br/><br/>The main draw of this movie is Peter and Gwen and their relationship. If you're a comic fan like myself then you'll know why this relationship is important.<br/><br/>Peter is still trying to keep the promise he made to Gwen's father by staying out of her life to protect her from his enemies. The scenes between Peter and Gwen really stand out thanks to the amount of chemistry these two share on screen. Their scenes are playfully intimate and really succeed in portraying the love they have for each other.<br/><br/>Dane Dehaan plays Harry Osborne, a once childhood friend of Peter's who was shipped off to boarding school while they were still young and returns to New York for family reasons. Dane Dehaan is great in this role and its shame he wasn't introduced in the first movie as he takes a bit of a back seat to Jamie Fox's character for a large part of the movie.<br/><br/>There are some truly great moments in this movie from Spideys battles with Electro to a scene showing Peters loneliness through the changing of the seasons. I would of liked more of Dane Dehaan as Harry and the Green Goblin as it feels like Electro was shoehorned in to keep this movie from feeling like a rehash of Sam Raimi's first Spider-man movie with the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie but hope the next one can focus more on the characters that matter rather than trying to cram in as many new ones as possible."
"steadysam","6","5","15","17 April 2014"," A treat in many aspects
","When set pictures of the characters from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 made their way online in early 2013, I was very excited to see what these characters were going to do to contribute to the movie's plot. But as the trailers started to roll out, I felt a lot of footage was being given away. I felt as if I had seen most of the film's major plot points. Thankfully, as I walked out of the theater after seeing this film, I was pleasantly surprised as The Amazing Spider-Man 2 not only has edge-of-your-seat moments and a surprisingly unique soundtrack, but it managed to give me a few surprises even with much of the footage released. The cast of this film are well-picked. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone reprise their roles as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Gwen Stacy. The chemistry between the two is extremely well done and very believable, which is understandable considering the two actors are real-life couples. Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-Man to me. He is much funnier and relatable than any other iterations of Spider-Man that I have seen. The villain roles in this movie are given to Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan. Foxx plays Max Dillon, a lonely, self-proclaimed ""nobody"" who idolizes Spider-Man after bumping into him. But after a wiring accident, he turns into Electro, a being with the ability to control electricity. Although Foxx slightly disappoints in this role due to lack of development for the Max Dillon character, he still manages to pull of a sinister performance without making the character dull or uninteresting. DeHaan plays Harry Osborn, a childhood friend of Peter's who is looking for Spider-Man. DeHaan shines throughout the entire film. Not one moment did he seem uncomfortable with the role. He has a creepy edge to his performance that keeps you hooked on him every time he appears in a scene. The CGI in this film is also very credible and was one of the big highlights of the movie for me, especially considering that I saw it in 3D. There's a mid-film Time Square fight which is beautiful to watch. Colours and electricity seem to leap off the screen but at the same time, are not too distracting. As I mentioned earlier, the soundtrack for this movie is unique and impressive, thanks to the combined efforts of Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams and a handful of other composers. Some segments of the soundtrack are bright and cheerful, like Spider-Man's heroic theme, and some segments are dark and demonic, like Electro's theme, a fast-paced whispering voice which relays the thoughts going on in Electro's head. It is timed perfectly and makes up for the lack of character development. Overall, what do I think of The Amazing Spider-Man 2? It's a marvelous entry into the Amazing Spider-Man series even if it does feel slightly rushed. With likable characters, heart-pounding moments, stunning special effects and a great soundtrack, that's more than enough for me to give this film a well-deserved 8 out of 10."

","I watched the first Amazing Spiderman film on a school trip and thought it was amazing! I saw the trailer of this and thought it was good, but the film was in fact a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Spiderman just kept fighting pretty much all the time and I was close to falling asleep a few times. First, he was fighting some blue electric man. Then, he was fighting his own friend that turned into a goblin. Then, his girlfriend died.<br/><br/>It was all too much. He was fighting so much there was hardly any element of romance, horror or adventure.<br/><br/>I wouldn't waste my time watching this, I would just watch How to train your dragon 2 instead."
"arnieiam","6","4","11","11 May 2014"," It's the Amazing Hipster Spider-Man
","I'm sorry, I really want to love this film and in general the film series but for the most part I was mildly thrilled. I still have a soft spot for Raimi's film's even though I know Garfield and Stone are way better to watch than Maguire and....ugggggh...Kirsten Dunst and the 3rd film was awful. <br/><br/>However I will give credit to where credit is due, this film does do some stuff better. Like they show the Rhino, pre-armour, as this crazy Russian gangster. The swinging and action sequences look cool as hell. Spider-Man makes his wise cracks, which were rarely in the Raimi films. Also Peter Parker takes the initiative and researches ways to defeat his foe. And Spidey's got the original costume.<br/><br/>Yes I said foe, singular. The plot is too dense for it's own good and it ends up devoting screen time to the wrong things. The villains are one of them. It eventually ends up being that Electro is the main villain, and man is his story arc weak and silly to begin with. Seriously, who keeps a vat of electric eels lying around, and conveniently place them under a live wire and- OK calm down. And they call Raimi's films silly. <br/><br/>There are way too many plot threads, and some really didn't require a resolution. Especially that thing with Peter's dad. Any idiot from a mile away could've easily figured out that his dad was fleeing because this company wanted to misuse his inventions and blah blah blah screen time wasted.<br/><br/>Another thing that wastes screen time is the on again off again relationship between Peter and Gwen. Sure the two actors have chemistry but this stuff relative to the plot was tooth rotting. And also it really pushes the hipster aesthetic on you. And for those who've read the comics, you can tell that this movie has way less than subtle foreshadowing. <br/><br/>And this is where my argument, on why the previous decade's Spidey films (at least the first two) are actually better, comes full circle. The Raimi film's have more of a timeless quality to them. They have that post 9/11 vibe and the stories flow really well albeit being very simple. When I watch the Amazing Spidey films, I can easily tell how dated they are. From the bad haircuts and clothes to the dubstep-ish music. Thank you director of 500 days of summer.<br/><br/>In the end this movie is enjoyable. I can nitpick it to death but we all know Marvel needs to consolidate all their characters, now."

"emowolf85","8","4","11","3 May 2014"," Artistic Directing and Thought-Provoking Themes Prove a Great Spidey Flick
","The Amazing Spider-Man series I think is the prime example of critical injustice. Raimi's original films were so highly praised by critics that these new films, despite holding a different taste, are victim to the burden of comparisons. Raimi's films were exaggerated and cheesy, when Webb focuses more on psychological principles. That's why I loved the first film so much, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is a superhero sequel superior in almost every aspect. While being 2 hours and a half long the film keeps a steady, and fast pace where it always has a conflict building to keep you invested. Each scene feels important to the emotions emphasized in the film so no minute is wasted. Peter and Gwen are one of the most believable couples in cinema and their relationship is the core of the story, and it never gets overshadowed by the main villains or sub-plots. A major complaint I hear of the film is that the reveal of Peter's parents backstory is disappointing, but the movie explains it's only a tidbit of information, and that Marc Webb is building up the whole truth within each movie. Therefore, it builds the suspense immensely in this film and we get to see his parents as fully breathing and living characters rather than a plot catalyst. The strongest aspect of the film though is the theme: No human deserves to be alone, and isolation and abandonment costs immense psychological damage. Every main character has this theme imposing them somehow, and it really adds to the relatability of the characters. Even the villains have humanity in their motivations due to this theme, and that is very rare for a superhero film. The directing is almost Stanley Kubrick-esque in some senses. Action sequences rely on musical cues and tones for movement and emotion, which has not been implemented well in superhero movies until this film. It makes the fights all the more memorable and impressive, as my heart was racing during the climax of the film. Several scenes possess an almost dream-like quality, with dramatic lighting and celestial-like movements. It drifts you away from reality, unlike other superhero movies which usually emphasize upon the realistic world. Spider-Man's world is advanced and foreign, yet familiar in emotional comprehension. Only real issue that holds this film down is that it perhaps drags on a bit after the climax, as the following scenes don't flow together as the rest of the film does, making the ending perhaps a bit overdone. This is definitely a more artistically-directed film than the first one, and it accomplishes that well. Overall, I must exclaim that it replaces ""The Dark Knight"" as my favourite hero flick. It's a universally emotional and significant film, with a more meaningful and overlooked theme than the Dark Knight offered. It made me realize how much others do impact who we are and how it defines our virtues; a film that is emotionally powerful rather than philosophically can just sometimes mean more. This movie is the only one that has EVER made me shed a tear. Hate me all you want, but I love artistic liberty in film and interpreted the themes in this movie personally. You can make this film your own, and that makes it all the more fun and meaningful. I give ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" a solid 8/10."
"rich99765","8","4","11","2 May 2014"," A rare treat in 3-D
","I have to preface this review by saying that I normally do not care for movies filmed in 3-D. I normally just go if it is in the right time slot. I feel like it just hurts my eyes sometimes. Captain America 2 contained some action sequences that really bothered me in 3--D. I think they finally got it right in this film. I really enjoyed the 3-D action sequences in this film. The final action scene with electro was very aesthetically pleasing. That is all I will say because I don't want to give anything away.<br/><br/>I also thought that Andrew Garfield did a great job. He seems to fit the role of Peter Parker naturally. The team did a great job casting this film. The acting was very believable. I loved the cameo by Paul Giamonti. <br/><br/>I felt like the story could have been a little more interesting, but sometimes it is best to keep the plot simply in these blockbuster super hero films. Overall, I would say that my son and I had a great time at this movie."
"Seltheus","6","4","11","30 April 2014"," Very entertaining, but not compelling.
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 manages to give a nice and entertaining 2 hours and 22 minutes, but don't expect this movie to be on par with recent comic adaptions like Avengers, or Captain America: The Winter Soldier on a pure ""movie enjoyment"" level.<br/><br/>While The Amazing Spider-Man 2 does deliver on the entertainment part, it fails to deliver on the same level in character development and generally speaking anything besides the pure entertainment part.<br/><br/>The one thing that Amazing Spiderman 2 suffers the most from is sadly similar to Spiderman 3 of the former trilogy. It is too packed with villains, plots and story lines that on their own would have made for a very nice story if developed correctly, but due to the amount of them in one movie, all of them fall short of being really ""compelling"".<br/><br/>Some people tend to argue exactly the opposite, that the amount of story lines and plots were delivered well and it wasn't too packed, but fail to mention the downside of it. Almost all interactions between Spider Man and the villains in this movie and even some characters that are supposed to have a deep impact on his feelings and decisions, are limited to 2-3 encounters over the whole course of the movie. Of course this makes it easier to build in several plots and story lines, but it doesn't manage to deliver them compelling enough, that you actually have the feeling this is a fundamental story part at all, and then it's already over before you really had the feeling it began.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD! For example they try to build a pre relationship between Electro and Spider-Man that is actually meant to describe the reasoning behind Electro wanting to fight Spider-Man later on. This is done through one encounter scene between Spider-Man and Max months before he becomes Electro which lasts for around 45seconds. Their relationship is put to the test on their first encounter fighting and ends with their 2nd encounter fighting. There literally are no more than those 3 scenes I just mentioned between Spider Man and Electro. The very same thing goes for Peter and Harry. They meet once to give the audience the sense of ""they are best friends"". Then they briefly meet another 2 times before Harry is out to kill Spider Man.<br/><br/>SPOILER END! While I do get that they managed to implement several plots w/o the movie feeling overcrowded with information, that's also the biggest flaw in the whole movie. There is not enough information to make the whole characters and their actions reasonable but if they had done that, the movie would have had the problem of being overcrowded with information. So either way...they were out to lose that one.<br/><br/>Besides this I only had a problem with the very very many logical errors in some basic things happening during the movie, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>But odds are, if you liked Amazing Spider Man, you will also like Amazing Spider Man 2. It does deliver on entertainment, but fails to deliver on compelling story, so just be prepared for that and you're good."
"macromvontus","7","4","11","28 April 2014"," A few welcome improvements
","Given the hiccup that was the original reboot film, The Amazing Spider- Man 2 greatly improves on areas that needed to be improved all the while throwing in some little nods that keep the fans of the wall crawler attracted, but does the star studded villain cast only a few strokes of justice. The rest is... well.... a little empty.<br/><br/>The film picks up where the original sort of left off. Maybe some time after. Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker makes a stunning return, and I immediately noticed something different. The film successfully separates Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Yes we all know that Spider-Man was kind of an ass in the original reboot, but that is how Spider-Man was originally written. The same remains here, but unlike the first Amazing Spider-Man, Peter Parker actually shows evidence of a deep emotional struggle. Rather than just coasting through the movie as the incredibly cocky ""I'm Spider-Man, whatever"" guy, he finally realizes that his actions have results and he tries his absolute hardest to avoid negative ones. Rebuilding Peter Parker's character to one we are more familiar with is definitely one of the strongest points of the film. Emma Stone did well as Gwen Stacy as you might have expected. The biggest surprise to me was actually Dane DeHaan's fantastic angsty and loathsome Harry Osborne. This is something you have to see yourselves.<br/><br/>Electro. Now there's something we need to talk about. Max Dillon (played by Jamie Foxx) is a proper psychopath in every sense of the word, and with some pretty damn awesome powers too. But with great powers comes great responsibility, and here we see that the writers... well... weren't quite responsible enough. Jamie Foxx acted the part extremely well, problem is, the script he was reading off of wasn't quite there for his character. This is incredibly damaging to the film as Electro is basically the main villain.<br/><br/>As for anyone hyped about Rhino being in the movie... don't even bother with that one he has 4-5 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>The special effects and fight scenes are fantastic. I took every little stroke of detail in as I watched Electro cause chaos in New York. Last point... FOR ONCE THIS IS THE ONLY MARVEL MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN WITH AN INCREDIBLY SHALLOW AND DISAPPOINTING END CREDITS SCENE. This is unforgivable and a complete atrocity. Why? well the content of which is stuff literally everyone knows and has possibly seen before. Sorry die hard Marvel cinema fans. No shockers here.<br/><br/>Summing my key points to a close, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a great example of the potential that can definitely be met if you develop characters more, but it is at the same time is also an example of what happens when you don't."
"davetomkins","6","4","11","27 April 2014"," It's Great For Stunts and Action, Otherwise Dull
","I watched The Amazing Spiderman 2 last night. It was exactly as I have come to expect a Marvel movie to be: ridiculous bad guys, stunts, explosions and a bit of back story to keep us relatively interested. It does exactly what it says on the tin; I think if you REALLY criticise it, then it's not your type of film anyway.<br/><br/>That said, the dialogue was not particularly snappy, the plot was utterly predictable and most of the acting wasn't that great. Jamie Foxx went through the motions (as much as you can when you're playing an electrified bloke with a vendetta) and every time I look at Andrew Garfield I see Andy Murray and think to myself ""boring"". Dane DeHaan was suitably unhinged as Harry Osborn but unfortunately had very little back story, and Emma Stone was, as usual, gorgeous. I did however find myself a bit bored every so often when I saw ANOTHER long shot of Spidey jumping off a building.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film; just that there's not much point to it. If you're looking for explosions and stunts with no obvious plot, this is perfect."
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","11","25 April 2014"," Amazing Spider-Man 2 for the most part was amazing.
","This sequel movie to 2012's Amazing Spider-Man was a lot better than that movie. After the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 in 2010, the reboot series had a rough start for me, as I couldn't stand the first movie. Watching the trailers for this sequel. It look as bad as Spider-Man 3 with way too much villains. After watching this film, I'm glad it was good. Hands down, it's probably my favorite movie from all of the Spider-Man movies. Directed by Marc Webb, the movie is about Spider-Man's most important conflict: separating his real life as Peter Parker from that of Spiderman. As the villains become more and more dangerous, Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) is having a hard time, trying to keep his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) away from the danger. He's haunted by the memories of Stacy's father ordering him to keep Stacy safe. Meanwhile, an old friend Harry Osborne (Dane DeHaan) has come back to ask Peter Parker to help him with his father research, so that Peter can save him from a life ending disease. When one of Harry Osborne's experiments go horrible wrong leading Harry Osborne and his co-worker Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) disfigure. Both men seek revenge on Peter Parker, the one that turn his back against them. Without spoiling too much. I have to say, that the movie has a lot of sub-plots going on it, that it can be a bit confusing if you haven't remember much of the first movie. It felt a little bit cramp and rushed. I felt the movie could have work better, if it kept to one villain. Originally, the movie was just going to be about Electro (Jamie Foxx) hints the early title of 'Rise of Electro"", but the producers add way too much villains here. First off, the movie doesn't make Electro seem much of a threat. He is quickly defeat time after time by Spider-Man in the film. Still, Jamie Foxx makes the role, his own, and he was pretty good. I just thought, the way, he became Electro was a bit too cartoony. I still love the modern update look of the villain. The way, they bring in Harry Osborne into this movie was sloppy at best. The idea of Harry Osborne still being good friends with Peter Parker since grade school seem out of touch. Really, he was sent to boarding school around the same time Peter's parents disappeared, and Peter meets him for the first time since then seem awkward. Both, don't look like they have any connection with each other. Honestly, are we're supposed to be believe that they are so close friends? I think, the originally movies did this, better, making Harry Osborne, a well-rounded character than a stereotype bad guy dark loner that this movie does. Even the character of Norman Osborne (Chris Cooper) seem wasted as he was mention in the first movie, and in this, have a few lines and dies. Wow, Oscar winner used badly. Don't get wrong, Dane DeHaan is a fine actor, but he comes from the young Leo DiCaprio's acting school where screaming and shouting is the norm. Honestly, I don't even think the Green Goblin was even that menacing. He look like evil Peter Pan. Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man was great. He had some of best funny moments, and lines in the film. The way, he plays off as the charming, yet direct-less orphan is top-watch. I do have to say, that bringing in father plot gives the character new light, but nothing new is explain. Big props to using bits of the novel Mary Jane to explain what happen to his parents. Also it seems the arc from the first movie of Peter hunting Uncle Ben's killer has been dropped, which is horrible since it was a sequel hook. I also love how the movie greatly made the Spider-Man suit, way better. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was OK. I do think the weak conflict between them was pretty bad, but I did like how the movie kept true to the comic #121–122 with the ending scene with Gwen Stacy. I love most of the supporting cast in this movie. Sarah Fields as Aunt May was good, but I was a bit tired of how much she mention Uncle Ben. She mention Ben in every scene with Peter. I don't like Paul Giamatti as Alekesi Sytsevich/ The Rhino. It was a bit too hammy. I don't like Felicity Jones as Felicia. She looks a bit too young, and I just don't like Cat-Woman rip-offs. I do like the cameo character from Adam-Troy Castro's spin-off Sinister Six novel trilogy. Also look for Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee cameo. Also check out, the delete scene with Shailene Woodley as Mary Jane Watson. The action in this movie was some of the best. The CGI visual effects wasn't that bad. It was pretty watchable in 3D and works with the gimmick. The music by Hans Zimmler was epic. ""It's On Again"" by Alicia Keys Feat. Kendrick Lama was sick in a good way. I dig the 1960s Spider Man theme song having a cameo. The closing scene gives us, much to look forward to. Even with it being a bit cheesy with the Spider-Kid. I will be looking forward to the third movie in this series. The post-credit teaser scene was a bit from 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past where 20th Century Fox, allowed Webb to direct the film if Sony would promote the X-Men film for free. The scene's inclusion sparked confusion as I thought there was a X-Men–Spider-Man crossover film being planned, but I really doubt it. Sony announced two spinoffs of the series, which include the Sinister Six and Venom. So look forward to that. Overall: Good comic book movie. Welcome back, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."

","An 'ok' story that seems way too long. As entertaining as it is, there is no connection with the portrayal of the main characters. Maybe part of it, is me. I do not see Andrew Garfield as a viable Spiderman. He is a talented actor, but a poor replacement for Tobey Maguire. What a silly change. For one thing, the new Peter Parker comes off cocky and too snarky - no timidity - just plain arrogance mixed with a healthy dose of wining. How can I cheer for such an unlikable loser personality. Emma Stone's character is flat, I have no interest in her. She is a very pretty woman, but not much in the line of depth. Her emotional roller coaster is very painful to sit through. The Jamie Foxx portrayal of ""Electro"" was distracting to say the least. Is he good, or bad, or just took the wrong turn in life? Maybe I don't care? Why are all the modern day villains such weak, spineless, misunderstood goofs? Other than Rhino, all the villains in this movie are not really bad, they are just not understood...well cry me a freegin' river. My opinion...the franchise has run its course - pull the plug. I feel it is time to get the bug spray out and put an end to the Spiderman Saga."
"dg1000-765-693517","2","9","33","3 May 2014"," Hmm, yeah -- Not So Amazing...
","In brief, I expected this movie to be an amazing one, based off the cinematic trailers and sneak peeks. I fully expected Spider-man to go head-to-toe with Electro, Green Goblin, and the Rhino, as it seems to be so in the trailers. However, I was, unfortunately, mistaken I thought this movie was garbage. This is my sincere, personal opinion. I didn't like the first one too much, but this one was almost painful to watch. The cinematography and visual FX are quite stunning, although that's about the best thing there is.<br/><br/>The entire movie seems like its a ""rough draft,"" so to speak. The story has potential to be great, but it's really not.<br/><br/>The acting is generally sub-par, the writing is terrible, the character's circumstances are illogical (by this, I mean that the placement of certain characters at certain times does not make any sense), the story is too fragmented, there is WAY too much unnecessary dialogue, not enough action, and odd conflicts which do not usually make any sense.<br/><br/>I do not believe that anyone should expect this movie to be ""amazing,"" and, although I thought it to be garbage, other people have enjoyed it, so if you feel inclined to give it a try, feel free to watch it."

","Well it seems the hate for this sequel to the first rebooted Spider-Man is even more than the first film received. I really don't get it, the Raimi films were not that good, interesting or especially spectacular. Really people, Spider-Man 2 only gets the love it does because of the villains. Nothing to do with Raimi, Maguire, the script or anything else. Look, I get a lot of people have some love for Raimi's trilogy, but they were just not very fun films all round. The one thing this era has going for it (other than all the things I praised in the first film) is that it's fun! Sure a little over the top at times, but this is a superhero film. They are supposed to be fun and entertaining, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 delivers that in spades, even more than the first film did. Having got past the background and development you can get straight into the action so-to-speak.<br/><br/>So The Amazing Spider-Man 2 opens up by showing us more details of what happened the night Peter was left with his aunt and uncle as a child. We see Richard Parker destroying and disabling various things before being locked out of Oscorp and having to flee. We then re-run the events (shorter version) of Peter being left and then we get to see the events unfold immediately after that (I won't go into details) and how events unfolded leading to their disappearance. I liked this segment as it gives us more back story on Peter's parents and Oscorp as well as letting us know that these events have not been forgotten and pushed to the back burner and dismissed. They are import as they hold the key to everything Peter is and everything ultimately Oscorp is too.<br/><br/>The story begins fully in earnest with an immediate action scene. Spidey is enjoying himself in the skies above while swinging through the city (while also being late for his graduation) before learning of a police chase involving a stolen Oscorp truck. Naturally our favourite web-slinger swings into action and naturally chaos ensues. I have read in places that some people hate this whole introductory scene, citing Peter's selfishness about not caring much when it suits him about everyday normal folk. What they fail to realise is that, Peter is himself an average every day person, a teenager still in fact. What kind of attitude did they expect him to have? The same as Thor...or Iron man for that matter? The arguments are ridiculous. Regardless, Peter saves the day as every good superhero should do and just about manages to graduate on time (cue Stan Lee cameo).<br/><br/>This then leads us into the meat and potatoes of the film. Peter's ability, or lack off to deal with his life on a personal level, a family level, relationships, understanding who he is, dealing with the guilt of breaking his promise to Gwen's (Stone) father and of course, being the cities web-slinging hero. Once again Garfield excels in his role. He is funny, arrogant, selfish, caring and loving the attention when in his suit. Garfield pulls it off brilliantly and I will say it again, so far ahead of Maguires acting skills it isn't even funny. This second film does have more action and visual set pieces but also has a lot more interaction going for it in terms of the people in Peter's life. The film also does a great job of humanizing Peter's character too, showing that in spite of everything else, he is still just a nerdy teen who has no clue what he actually wants or when, as like most people of his age, that seems to change on a daily if not hourly basis.<br/><br/>We also have two new villains introduced this time round and personally they were the only real let downs in the films. Electro is fantastic and Foxx plays the character with a lot of gusto, I just feel he was a little underused or that his character could have been explained a little more or better. DeHaan is reasonable enough as Harry Osborn but feel his alter-ego comes on a little too quickly and far too late in the game to make any real difference other than a convenient and slightly contrived plot device. That being said, both play their parts well enough with what they are given to work with. While there have been complaints a plenty regarding both characters quick change to full on lunatic, let's be honest here folks, the villains in these kind of movies are never exactly the most well wired upstairs are they? They are all, in their own way, an olive short of a pizza, so a rapid decline into full on villain mode within the confines of a films run-time can mostly be forgiven.<br/><br/>Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is once again a highlight of this series and her chemistry with Garfield is excellent. In a change from the first film, Aunt May's (Field) character has a lot more to do this time around and I personally thought the interaction between her and Peter was genuinely moving and funny at times. I guess just like any parent and child and they rub off each other wonderfully, much better than in the first film. The rest of the cast all do their job in an efficient manner. This sequel also (as hinted at before) delves into Peter wanting to find out more about his family and the connection to Oscorp. The scene where Peter finally starts to find out the truth and where he watches the 'Roosevelt' upload is very well done indeed and for an action superhero film it tugs at the emotions more than you might expect.<br/><br/>Visuals and photography are top notch here and overall the CGI is very well done. One particular scene where Peter's web shoot turns into an outstretched hand was particularly awesome given the context of the film at that moment. Probably not the most difficult CGI job in the world to a professional but it was well done and made me think at the time 'damn that's pretty cool'. Audio is excellent all round and the colour and look of the film is perfect. Just like a real life moving comic book. The film is very visually pretty and nice to watch. Action scenes are well filmed (much better than the first) and the only real complain might be the sometimes slightly dodgy script, but that can be forgiven easily in this kind of film, we are not after all watching The Godfather. Which leads once again to my opening paragraph. The film is just a great deal of fun all round.<br/><br/>To sum up, the film is not the mess that many critics and paying fans made it out to be. Easy to follow and with a simple enough story-line. Once again Garfield shines as Peter Parker and it is a real shame that Sony will never be finishing this new trilogy due to finally coming to an arrangement with Marvel to allow our beloved Spidey to appear in the MCU. The second part of this bad news is that Andrew Garfield's services were not retained and I personally feel that Marvel missed the boat there, unless there was some contractual reason behind that. A new branching story-line or even continue the third planned film as a full Marvel production perhaps, it's a real shame that didn't happen.<br/><br/>If I could give this a an extra quarter of a star I would as it isn't a four star by a long shot, but neither does it deserve to be three and a half either. Excellent fun superhero feature if that is what you are into (and don't still hold onto Raimi's films like a jilted lover). Once again, sorry Sam.<br/><br/>
The Sage's Rating: 7/10"
"johnbell863","1","2","4","9 January 2020"," one of the worst superhero movies ever
","Of course there are other contenders, like Steel and Fant4stic... but this movie had a high budget and a dedicated fanbase and it still was a failure by all definitions of the word. The writing was terrible and awkward, as if the actors were improvising every line without knowing what the plot was about, and for some strange reason characters say the same lines twice in a row which is very irritating. Harry Osborn just shows up without even being mentioned in the first film, and the audience is supposed to just go along with him and Peter being best friends since childhood... so there's that. Also we're thrown into some hackneyed, underdeveloped subplot about Harry trying to steal Spiderman's blood to cure himself of a genetic disease that his father kept secret from him until he was on his death bed because he hates him I guess? Apparently this disease makes green goo leak out of your hairline and gums, which I guess was one of those comic book plots that would be really difficult to adapt in a movie without it appearing ridiculous because it appears very, very ridiculous. Another really dumb subplot is Peter's father leaving him a big ol' scavenger hunt to solve in order to learn whatever. I forgot what is at the end of the scavenger hunt because the last ""clue"" is a coin that Peter puts in an abandoned subway terminal, causing a car that his dad mechanically rigged to come up out of a secret hole in the ground, and I think there was a working laboratory inside or something really stupid like that. Oh yeah and Electro is in this movie too, not the Electro from the comics but just some weird guy who has a random love/hate relationship with both Spiderman and attention, and gets free orthodontic work from some electric eels (I could make this stuff up if I suffered enough brain damage, but I assure you it all really happens in the movie). They even try to shoehorn in the Sinister Six as sequel-fuel, which made me laugh while watching this because nearly every scene in this movie was a nail in the coffin of Garfield's turn as Spiderman. The only decent part of this movie is when Peter is crying over Gwen's dead body, then it immediately reverts back to its true form: a terrible, clumsy, boring, awkward mess of a film."

"TheMovieDoctorful","10","2","4","18 December 2018"," Unfairly Maligned, One Of The Best Superhero Films Ever
","Much like with Daredevil, this is a film where I really wanted to bring attention to just how unfairly maligned this film is. Thus, I'm going to structure it in a manner where I will mostly be directly addressing and debunking the various misconceptions and (In my opinion) shallow arguments that are made against it. It's also worth noting that, to date, it's my 3rd favorite Marvel comics film behind Spider-Man 2 and Into the Spider-Verse.<br/><br/>Reason #1: ""Electro turns evil because Spider-Man forgot his name.""<br/><br/>Starting off with stuff that's just objectively false, we have the complaint that Max Dillon loses it because Spider-Man couldn't remember his name. This is ludicrous. There's a good 2 minutes of very important content between Spider-Man forgetting Max's name and Electro beginning to snap. While Spider-Man, the only person who had shown Max an ounce of compassion or love in his entire life, forgetting his name was definitely hurtful, Max still puts his trust in Spider-Man to save him, agreeing to talk with him in a safe area away from civilians. Immediately upon putting his trust in Spider-Man, Max is shot by a trigger-happy sniper. When Max retaliates, Spider-Man subdues Max and saves the sniper. This leads to the entire city cheering and applauding Spider-Man while jeering, booing and insulting Electro. A man who has been mistreated by everyone he met nearly his entire life gets humiliated in front of one of the most densely populated cities in the United States by the only person he thought he could trust. So we have an abandonment complex, presumed decades of abuse and humilation/perceived betrayal by a loved one in front of a mass audience, and people still think Electro became a villain cause Spidey forgot his name?<br/><br/>Reason #2: ""The film didn't know what tone it was going for.""<br/><br/>It was going for the tone of the comics; a universe where lighthearted characters coping with dramatic and serious events. Just like the Spider-Man comics it's based on, it perfectly balances cheesy, fluffy comedy with heavy, emotional drama, using the former as a way of counterbalancing against the latter and making its impact hit all the harder. The best Spider-Man comics are the ones that start of amusing and comical and slowly ease their way into something more emotionally powerful and affecting. Peter's silly, goofy quips and cutesy, dorky dialogue with Gwen make the shock and weight of her tragic death at the clock tower all the more hard hitting.<br/><br/>Reason #3: ""Gwen is useless and an idiot and responsible for her death.""<br/><br/>The ""responsible for her death"" complaint is just flat out not true. She went to the power plant to stop Electro and succeeded (She's actually even more useful in defeating Electro than Spider-Man is, which pretty much negates the whole ""idiot"" complaint.) None of the characters, especially Gwen, has any way of knowing about Green Goblin at the time. As for ""useless"", she has a clear and well paced arc of coming to terms with her feelings for Peter, while still not letting her feelings for him control the direction of her life, and, like I said, defeats Electro in the film's climax. Now compare this to Michelle of Spider-Man: Homecoming, a plot device who solely exists for Peter to have a crush on and save as Spider-Man (And later to make the Vulture twist less shocking.)<br/><br/>Reason #4: ""The film has no themes and too many subplots.""<br/><br/>While the film has many subplots that may initially seem a bit overstuffed, they are all connected by the themes of the film; those being abandonment and hope. Peter feels abandonment from his parents, Electro feels abandonment from Spider-Man and both Harry and Gwen feel abandonment from Peter. Of all these characters, it's only Gwen who finds the hope and inner strength to push past her own abandonment and move on from it. It's in her death that we see Spider-Man find the hope he needs to persevere beyond his pain and mourning (A brilliant subversion of the ""women in the refrigerator"" trope inadvertently started by The Death of Gwen Stacy, the comic which the film is heavily based on), becoming the hero we all love and recognize as Spider-Man fans. Now that I mention it, Gwen is almost more the hero of the story than Spider-Man is.<br/><br/>Reason #5: ""Peter is a whiny crybaby.""<br/><br/>I really don't like this complaint, to be honest, as it reeks of toxically masculine concepts that ""men can't cry"" which shoulda died out a while ago, but look at what this Spider-Man suffers. He's dealing with a crisis of conscience with his relationship with Gwen, abandonment complexes from his parents leaving him, his best friend dying and the death of his girlfriend. He had every reason and more to cry.<br/><br/>Reason #6: ""It spends too much time setting up future movies.""<br/><br/>The only example of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 doing this is the scene with The Man in the Hat at the ending and MAYBE Felicia Hardy. That's it. And yes, that includes The Rhino. Rhino represents how Spider-Man's challenges are only going to get harder after Gwen's death, but how he must keep his own hope alive. Because his hope represents the city's hope. That's why Rhino starts the movie off as a common thug and ends it as a supervillain. Meanwhile, Homecoming shoves in/teases the Scorpion, The Prowler, Mary Jane Watson, Betty Brant, the Iron Spider and the Sinister Six, all of which have no connection to the narrative or themes of the movie, and yet it somehow gets a pass.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an emotional, funny and brilliant comic book movie that does a wonderful job tackling very serious real world issues like abandonment, hopelessness and mortality all within the framework of a painstakingly loving Spider-Man adaptation. It's a perfect encapsulation of everything I love about the Spider-Man story and one of the best superhero films ever."

","Spiderman (Andrew Garfield) faces off against Electro (Jamie Foxx), an electrically-charged super villain. Typical MCU PG shtick: a superhero cracking wise while saving the city from violent but mostly bloodless carnage. Garfield is OK as the web-slinger but much of his dialogue was strained and contrived, especially the incessant quips. Emma Stone makes for a striking Gwen Stacy but the character's 'deux ex machina' arrival in the power plant was a silly plot twist and Jamie Foxx is fine as the syntho-voiced and largely CGI Electro but painfully awful as pre-villain nebbish Max Dillion. The film seems rushed and is stuffed with too many characters. In addition to Electro, there is a perfunctory fight with the Green Goblin (including a wedged in back story) and a teaser squabble with a ridiculously mechanised 'Rhino' (Paul Giamatti, although it's hard to imagine any attempt to depict the Rhino character not looking ridiculous). The plot is a by-the-numbers superhero sketch with yet another energy-sucking threat that maybe can be stopped by feeding it too much energy (a threat/solution that's been around since at least 1953's 'The Magnetic Monster'). Typical for MCU opuses, the film is very uneven, swinging between sentimental melodrama and light-weight action-adventure, and even the tragic event in the final reel is granted no more the a few minutes of drama before Spidey is back to his signature gibes and one-liners. Most of the climactic battle is so drenched with flashing lights and shifting colour that it is hard to tell what is supposed to be happening and action sequences are filled with too many gimmicky (and clichÃ©d) slow-mo and bullet-time shots. The film's unimpressive returns killed this iteration of the Wall-crawler (the second of three in a decade)."

It was great to finally see Rhino appear though the only thing I don't like about Rhino is the way it looks. It would've been better had it looked like the one in the animated series.

It would've been better had Gwen still been around. There's another villain called the Green Goblin who happens to be Spiderman's biggest enemy. I liked how it appeared in this ""Amazing"" Spider-Man story. Somehow, this movie worked, but the amazing thing is that it could've been more better. I really liked the beginning and final parts especially the ending. I liked the way this movie was going basically. The ""Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was a very good sequel apart from a few things."

What was missing is the antagonistic attitude of Harry; poor dealing with electro. Can't the spider-man still be reformative in his approach rather than finishing all the evil doers. The effects and sound do add but little. The entire innocence of spider-man is turned into a witty role that is not much suited."

","The first Amazing Spiderman was surprisingly good. I liked the Tobey Maguire series and felt that a reboot wasn't necessary. However, that reboot didn't feel like it is covering old ground, and felt fresh, original and energetic. It was interesting from start to finish.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the second movie in the reboot series doesn't really add anything or feel fresh. It is pretty much a formulaic comic book adaptation. The only attempts at character development - the love story - felt weak, and were quite dull and tedious.<br/><br/>This said it is entertaining enough to keep you watching.

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 took a long time to get going. In the beginning of the movie I thought that Spider-Man was trying really hard to be that sarcastic, funny, wise-guy that Stan Lee realized, many years ago, Spider-Man was supposed to be. Certainly this franchise has come a long way since Toby Maguire's version of Spidey, but it still isn't quite there yet with Andrew Garfield playing the web-slinger.<br/><br/>I didn't really get into this movie until it started looking, feeling, and sounding a lot more like a Marvel movie does today. Until that point, I was considering more like a 3 or 4, rather than the 6-stars I eventually gave it.<br/><br/>I didn't see this film until 2017, so I think I was perhaps spoiled by the ""new"" Spider-Man and a host of fantastic Marvel movies that followed The Amazing Spider-Man 2's release in 2014.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the ""Marvel Galaxy"" of movies, see this. If not, then save it for a day when there is nothing else to watch."
"neazy","6","0","0","23 October 2017"," Surprisingly watchable
","A rare case of the sequel being an upgrade on the first installment. This film is a mixed bag. It sometimes suffers from the same disjointed storytelling as its predecessor, and is often corny as hell and therefore predictable. There are too many competing story lines, and they don't entirely add up or resolve themselves. Spiderman is a certified jerk. There are some bits that just don't quite work - how, for instance, a man who consistently demonstrated to be made of pure electricity, and who can disseminate himself at will, can be physically punched and tied up in the final battle is beyond me. But the characters themselves are intriguing, well-cast, compelling, and visually exemplary. The best thing about this film is that it feels quite like a video game - the segmented nature of the plot, the visuals, particularly in the Electrode battles, and the overall tone really take you along for the ride, and it was quite refreshing to have a film like this just having some fun with its content, something which the first installment entirely failed to do. Doing so draws the eye away from the problems, making them, if not less noticeable, then at least less irritating. This is a deeply flawed film, but once it gets into its stride (which, admittedly, takes a while) it is pretty good fun. The ending is surprisingly brave, and is a powerful way to round off the narrative. Also, any film that nicks its final scene from The Incredibles knows what's good for it. Glad I watched it."
"footballchampafc","Null","0","0","5 December 2016"," Overall Great Movie, , Some Costly Flaws
","I know this movie upset a lot of the die-hard Marvel fans and comic book readers. A lot of people thought this move was ruined because of Garfield's portrayal as Parker and how different it was from the comic books. I understand that, but if you are like me and just want to watch a good movie, you will find this movie, and the first one, to be thoroughly entertaining. While I did find the villains to be flawed (pointless backstory to Electro, some cheesy scenes with Electro, Green Goblin being hardly featured), the movies are very action packed with the right amount of romance. Most of the negative reviews you will see are from the 10 year old kids who don't appreciate a good backstory and all they want to see is fighting. I found the chemistry between Garfield and Stone to be flawless, with Garfield showing some shy and quirky characteristics we all know, and obviously Emma Stone is beautiful and a great actress who worked very well with Garfield, especially when they were separated but you can tell they both really loved each other. The love story makes up for the few flaws in the story line itself, because by the end of the movie, you find yourself really connected with Gwen and Peter. I think Gwen's death was kind of weird and pointless, especially because they really just tried to cram it into the end of the move and it didn't really play to your emotions as much as it just confused you. However, as I said, there is perfect chemistry between the young couple and Webb found a good way to tie it into the main story. The visual effects in the movie are stunning, there is no question there, and the story with Dane DeHaan, while short lived, was very well portrayed. In my opinion, I would have liked to see a lot more of Harry and Green Goblin than Electro, but it just depends on if you like Electro more than me or not. As I said, I found Electro kind of pointless, and given the fact that I preferred DeHaan as a villain, there really wasn't enough time to establish Electro's story line, add Harry to the mix, and add in the love story. In my opinion the movie would have been a lot better of if the main villain was Green Goblin and if Electro had a smaller part, or honestly if he wasn't in the movie at all. I think Electro was a good idea but he took up too much time that needed to be used to grow the story with Harry, Peter, Green Goblin, etc. All in all, this was a very entertaining movie and I highly suggest you watch it. I did mention a lot of flaws but they are fairly small and can be overlooked because Webb found a way to make those flaws entertaining. So basically this movie was great, it just had the possibility to be a lot better and I am disappointed that they didn't capitalize on these or make a third film. Even without these, it is still one of my favorite movies and a great thriller with an enticing love story."

I really hoped we would finally get to see Carnage as the main villain in the third film.<br/><br/>Watching this film didn't bore me and i think that's mostly the point of such movies.

"kevinxirau","Null","0","0","18 October 2015"," An improved version of ""Spider-Man 3"".
","I'd never thought I'd be faced with a film that I enjoy a lot and at the same time be so conflicted on it. Critically speaking, it's far from the best Spider-man movie and I can see why some would dislike this flick while simultaneously there many things I love about it and others do too. TASM 2 has become something of a anomaly in the world of superhero adaptations and saying that makes me feel strange. Why is that? Let's take a look.<br/><br/>To get the bad out of the way and over with, the movie makes some of the same mistakes as ""Spider-Man 3"", mainly having a story with tons of plot lines going on at the same time. We have Peter struggling with his relationship with his love interest, three villains showing up, the mystery regarding his parents, a conspiracy in Oscorp, etc. A few things get somewhat contrived and there's not only lots of product placement (a minor issue on my part) but also world building that feels thrown in, largely due to Sony trying to establish a cinematic universe to rival Marvel. It was clear that they wanted to do sequels to keep making money and keep the film license to Spidey. It's also something of a way to prevent copying aspects of the original trilogy like how the Daily Bugle is utilized. Also, if you're simply an action junkie, there's a large gap between two major fight scenes, so you'll have to wait quite a bit.<br/><br/>Having said all that, why is it that I still like this movie compared to ""Spider-Man 3""? For one thing, I enjoy Peter's character and his relationships. Andrew Garfield really gets the hero, a smart wisecracker that does what he can to help others but at the same time he's conflicted about his chaotic life and how it affects everyone. I also like how he doesn't need to take his mask off a lot to express himself. His personality really shines through simply through his voice and body language, something Maguire never really achieved since much of the time he's mask-less, not that I blame him. Don't get me wrong, I like Tobey, but Garfield just nails his role. It's like Spider-man just leaped off the page. Peter and Gwen are a fantastic together, probably helped by the actors' real-life relationship. Their chemistry is irresistible and the drama between them is engaging. Heck, this is arguably the strongest part of the film and is worth seeing in that action gap I mentioned.<br/><br/>The action scenes and SFX are great. The stakes are as high as ever given the scope of the threat the wall-crawler is faced with. The fights are well-choreographed with Spider-man and foes really beating the crap out of each other and flying everywhere. The use of slow-motion is excellent, with the viewer able to see the necessary details occurring in the environment, especially when Peter's spider sense comes into play, allowing him to see what's at stake and what needs to be done. Character designs are, for the most part, good with Spider-man's costume being by far the best I've seen on film yet. Electro is interesting, nice veiny make-up mixed with beautiful CGI currents flowing in his body and his electric powers are a visual delight. Rhino's mech suit is well-designed, looking both functional and powerful. Only Goblin's suit looks weird to me, though it's implied to be a prototype so it's passable, but his glider has a sleek and edgy look.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer outdid himself as the music is some of the best I've heard. There's several standout bits of OST, like Electro's techno suite with paranoid lyrics showing his insanity, Peter and Gwen's love music which is soothing and heartwarming, and Goblin's unsettling tone that raises to a thrilling battle music. Then there's Spidey's theme, which feels very grand and heroic, just what the web-slinger needs. Seriously, I could listen to this music all day.<br/><br/>Despite there being 3 villains like last time, the film makes a wise choice of focusing on two. Jamie Foxx does a good job with his role, a geeky engineer treated like crap most of his life becoming a dangerous villain after going through a tragic accident and grave misunderstanding with his idol Spidey. Some say his turn to the dark side was rushed, but I didn't see it that way. I felt that he had enough establishment and being treated badly constantly is enough to make anyone mentally unstable. Harry Osborn/Green Goblin is also portrayed well. Dane Dehaan manages to make him sympathetic and his friendship with Peter feels genuine. When he is stricken with a strange illness, it's sad seeing him slowly turning into a monster and he is pretty creepy when he does so. As for Rhino, he doesn't get much focus as he's simply a part of Spider-man's everyday life. Fans may get disappointed by this, but hey the villain was like this in the Ultimate comics. Still, Paul Giamatti makes this relatively simple baddie enjoyable hammy.<br/><br/>By all means, I shouldn't like TASM 2 but I do. It makes some the same mistakes as ""S-M 3"" but also improves on the rest. It's hard for me to give a definitive rating because people look for different things in a movie and this has so many elements that anyone can like/dislike. While I'm happy that Spider-Man will be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now, I'll also miss this series seeing as how it's now canceled and it's a shame because it has lots of good things like the overall story and actors. I guess the best way to sum it up is that this is a love-it-or-hate-it movie, but for me, I love it and I recommend this one over ""Spider-Man 3"" to any fan or moviegoer. In the words of Stan Lee: EXCELSIOR!"
"odnetenaka","2","8","29","8 May 2014"," This new Spider-Man series was going in such a good direction, but they had to ruin it with this movie :(
","I actually liked the previous movie and the fact that the story was starting the right way now. The lead actors are amazing and their chemistry is perfect. Then I liked the beginning of this movie, Spider- Man is having fun and he's happy and witty, he has reasons to be! He's super strong and he has a beautiful girl in love with him (even if they not always get along). However, the movie becomes really bad later on...<br/><br/>(This is when the major spoilers start!!)<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Starting with Gwen's death, this movie version is silly if you think about it. To be consistent, Spider-Man would forever blame himself for not shooting the web a few seconds earlier so she wouldn't hit the ground (I didn't see any blood on her from hitting solid cement)... and didn't even mention it... While the comics version is truly dramatic and powerful, since Spider-Man catches her with the web on a free-fall too, but her neck breaks due to the abrupt de-acceleration. Thus, in the comics, she was dead no matter what, because if he didn't throw the web, she would crash on the ground anyway. In the movie, it was just a miss- calculation and Peter was supposed to be a Physics genius... It definitely doesn't have the impact it should have had, to me.<br/><br/>Anyway, there are a lot more problems. For the rating to stay PG-13, they made the fight with the green goblin short and ridiculously insignificant. It is like he only showed up to kill Gwen, the camera didn't even go back to him afterward. The exaggeration of special effects during her death with all the slow motion, also made it worse, I was just waiting for them to get it over with already...<br/><br/>The main villain in this story was Electro and it was very well done, while on the other hand, the green goblin and the death of Gwen Stacy had no place in this movie. Specially not before they introduce Mary Jane as well, which they deliberately cut out to ""keep the focus"" on Gwen. Perhaps instead of killing her in such a rushed way, they could have started my bringing Mary Jane into the picture, following the comics.<br/><br/>I don't mind at all when the movies choose different paths form the original stories, but this one made no sense to me. I understand the idea of the green goblin fight: it was to bring the death of Gwen as a huge surprise to the audience after the big fight and successful victory over Electro, people don't expect the sad ending. But even though it was a good idea, it doesn't mean that it works and directors should be able to see that and make the best choices. I'm sad that this was the result.<br/><br/>Anyway, I am really disappointed now and I have no idea what to expect of the third movie, I guess the best is to not expect anything at all now... that is if I will even watch it in a movie theater or just wait for the DVD."
"SamJ_3000","3","8","29","1 May 2014"," What a crap!
","I should first mention I didn't like the first movie either. So maybe I wasn't meant to like the second one.<br/><br/>Let's start with what is working well; Emma Stone is good in her role. She is a good actress, and shine in contrast with the other actors. Then some special effects are interesting to see (when he goes around in the city), and overall the vfx quality is quite successful.<br/><br/>But then, everything else is not working quite good. The worst of it all is; there is no storytelling, and no story to tell. The story is bad and stupid (the planes part at the end is ridiculous, and is there to fill a big lack in the story in itself to captivate us - it was meant to put an urgency factor in the fight against electro and spiderman because in itself it was too boring to watch), but the scenes are put together in a way it skips big chunk of story to tell, leaving some explanation to our imagination (why did Electro ended up in the hands of Oscorp and not the police after his first fight!?). The love scenes are so bad and filled with emotive confusion that they will probably relate way more the people aged between 13yo and 16yo than mature people. Both bad guys seems to be totally crazy people put in some powerful situation (we don't need a story to tell when our bad guy are bad only because they are crazy), they really lack any basic credibility. There is no subtlety in the way the story introduce its rules (we see the exploding battery rule implication from the very moment it is mentioned, like the place the new energy complex introduced at the very beginning of the movie will take). This felt soooo cheap! Then there is Andrew Garfield who is only credible in his role when he tells one of his bad jokes. When he cries or is supposed to be serious, he doesn't look sincere at all... I'm not quite sure he is really better than Tobey McGuire... anyway, better or worst, he isn't a good actor in this movie (what happened since the Social Network?).<br/><br/>Even if the effects are well done, some full CG fighting scenes at the end are just plainly boring to watch. It is so exaggerated that there is always something that looks fake, and overall we don't get the point of paying over 200 millions to make expensive scene feel so boring.<br/><br/>This movie feels like an addition of different small story or ideas not very well connected together, full of cliché, in a very boring context with boring characters (Electro is deceiving, as was the Green Goblin for the 5 minutes we see him). Speaking of the Green Goblin, he is so inferior to the previous franchise one, that we wonder why they needed to reboot the franchise so rapidly...<br/><br/>I'll stop here.<br/><br/>I don't know how to emphasis how much I disliked this movie. It was simply terrible."

"p-jonsson","5","4","12","8 September 2014"," Mediocre movie made watchable by the SFX action
","It seems that Spider Man is doomed to receive mediocre to abysmal implementations on the big screen. Well, at least in my opinion. The Amazing Spider Man 2 currently have a rating of 7.1 which quite surprises me. This was not the worst Spider Man movie. The 2nd instalment, Spider-Man 2, in the first series with Tobey Maquire still holds that title firmly.<br/><br/>There are some nice special effect fireworks going on and there are some funny parts when Peter Parker puts on the mask and goes to action but apart from that I found the movie uninspired, with a mediocre plot and sometimes downright boring. The plot is perhaps suitable for a comics magazine with its standard set of unlikely events, backstabbing big-corporate employees and disgruntled scientists becoming super villains but on the big-screen one would expect a wee bit more effort going into the plot.<br/><br/>The main villain, Electro, was  well not really giving much of an impression. He never lifted above the pretty silly scientist letting everyone walk all over him and doing really, really stupid things like trying to put two high voltage cables together without turning off the power. Sure he tried to give a menacing appearance towards the end but to me he never really managed to elevate himself to a real super-villain. I almost got the impression that the director actually realized that Electra was not good enough and so decided to come up with some convoluted scheme to throw in The Green Goblin at the end. None of these villains are really bad, just mediocre.<br/><br/>Then of course there is the obligatory Peter Parker wallowing in self-pity that every director seems to just have to put in these movies. It is not funny and downright boring. And for the ending cliffhanger they throw in the Rhinoas some jerk in a monster mechanical suit :-( . What the f? The Rhino is supposed to have a polymer bonded to his skin and augmented strength and speed. Not be running around in some silly mechanical Rhino toy! The entertainment factor of this movie comes almost entirely from the SFX action and a few select scenes. Otherwise the movie was fairly (yawn) mediocre as far as I am concerned. Having said that, being the sci-fi and super-hero fan that I am, I will probably buy the next instalment anyway if one comes out."

Where as the Transformer movie was riddled entirely with action, so much so that I feel it pulled away from the movie and became more of a distraction. If you have seen the Transformers movie you will understand what I am talking about. Spiderman is much better in my opinion. <br/><br/>I am not a professional film critique just your average movie lover. If you are like me you will enjoy this movie. Just stick through the boring parts in the beginning, it will get better."
"xcvb_2003","8","4","12","6 June 2014"," Best Spidey movie so far.
","The Amazing Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the previous part and because of that my hopes were high for the sequel. Thankfully, the movie delivered.<br/><br/>The movie continues the plot of Peter's family and shows more about his dad in this movie and what happened to him etc. It also continues Peter's relationship with Gwen. I thought the plot was good. Sure it felt like it was just a set up to SOMETHING BIG that we will get in the sequels but still, it was good. Some pacing issues here and there but didn't bother me that much. The movie has a humorous tone most of the time but it does get Dark and emotional at times. <br/><br/>Adrew Garfield just kills it as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He upped his game from the previous part and it really shows here. The gorgeous Emma Stone also upped her game as Gwen stacy. And as the movie focuses A LOT on their relationship, it was great to see how awesome their chemistry was, improved from the previous part. Hell, I'll even say they are probably the best comic book movie couple. And that is a great thing because much of the plot relied on it. As for the villains, well Jamie Fox was pretty good as Electro. Dane Dehaan was awesome as Harry Osborn, he is a great actor. Wished there were more of the Goblin though as he only had a cameo of sorts in this movie. Seems like the next part will be pretty BIG. <br/><br/>The action is awesome in this movie. Best looking spidey scenes in the franchise so far. Loved everyone of them. Spiderman humor made them more awesome. Great CGI. Electro looked pretty cool.<br/><br/>Soundtrack was good. The track that was used whenever Electro was on screen was great. That techno/dubstep flowed greatly with Electro as he himself is electricity. :p<br/><br/>Don't really get the hate it got from many people. It is in my opinion the BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE to date. The Amazing spider 2 is indeed AMAZING. <br/><br/>8.3/10"

","As a self proclaimed Marvel fanboy, I purchased my tickets for the premier showing well in advance of opening night. After Amazing Spiderman, I was very excited to see what Mark Webb had in store next for Peter Parker. My expectations were at an all time high for this one, and for the most part the movie delivered.<br/><br/>As with the Amazing Spiderman, we get a wonderful performance by Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker. I know some don't like him but I think he does a great job of embodying the young carefree cockiness I have always loved about Spiderman. Jamie Foxx is also excellent as the villain Electro. He does a great job of making you feel sorry for his situation. The rest of the cast did a fine job and there wasn't anyone that stood out as having a poor acting role in this one.<br/><br/>What I think the movie does great, is deal with some very heavy things. I won't go into detail as I don't want to spoil anything but there are no punches pulled in this one. The film tackles some of the biggest moments in the comics and does so head on.<br/><br/>What I feel ended up bringing this film down for me was the fight scenes. Although movies don't have to be jam packed with fight scenes, I feel the ones in Amazing Spiderman 2 were just too short. Fights seemed to last seconds and we never really got to explore any of the characters fighting strengths.<br/><br/>The movie does clearly set its self for the next film in the series which to be honest I am a little worried about. I didn't like the look of some of the villains who are teased for the upcoming film but as they are barely in this one, I didn't let that sway my opinion of this movie.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if your a Spiderman fan you owe it to yourself to check this one out. It may not have fully reached and exceeded my expectations but it is without a doubt an excellent summer blockbuster."
"johnnymacbest","9","4","12","11 May 2014"," Surpasses the first film in many ways than one.
","Having just seen ASM 2, I say wholeheartedly that the second film is leagues BETTER than the first film. There's more drama, suspense, some dark moments, but perhaps the same comic-book like feel; something that Sam Raimi's films had, but never really delivered on it's premise. Thankfully however, Mark Webb and co, gave us a film that will be remembered for ages.<br/><br/>Even though there are three villains in this film, they are all superbly developed and well acted, something Sam Raimi's infamous Spiderman 3 SPECTACULARLY FAILED TO DO on SO MANY LEVELS. This film when you watch it gives you the sense that the movie is more understandable and therefore plausible in it's premise and execution. True, there are some rough spots in the film, but that does not in any way, shape, or form, take away from the experience.<br/><br/>One has to feel bad for Shailene Woodley, who was supposed to appear in the film as Mary Jane, Spidey's love interest for the uninitiated, but given how many characters and subplots are in the film, this was a wise decision on the film -makers part; after all, we wouldn't want to suffer through the same fate as Spiderman 3, would we? And unlike James Franco's take on Harry Osborne, Dane DeHaan gives a MUCH better performance. With his menacing stare and cold, blue eyes, he felt really intimidating as Spidey's future foe.<br/><br/>The action scenes are really spectacular and no pun intended, AMAZING!!! Never once was I bored throughout the entire runtime of the film. It's properly paced and intrinsically plotted with hints and bits of pieces for die-hard Spidey fans to discover; with some Easter eggs thrown in for good superhero measure. Tight direction and well choreographed, there's a great sense of tension and excitement to behold the on screen hijinks. I liked some of the slow-motion shots and they highlight the action; giving the film depth in it's perception of character and action-driven scenes and although not everyone will find them to their tastes, I think they work wonderfully in showcasing Spidey's acrobatic abilities which are greatly taken from the awesome source material.<br/><br/>So is The Amazing Spiderman 2 better than the first one? The overall answer is an AMAZINGLY enthusiastic YES!!! Mark Webb has done a really good job on giving us a sequel that goes in-depth of Peter Parker's psyche while also giving ample screen time to the villains and other character's involved in the titular hero's life. If the ending is anything to go by(which I will not spoil by any means) then we can expect more greater things to come in the overall narrative of this rebooted series. For once, three villains on screen are given screen time of character development and to be fair, it was a huge risk, but the risk payed off thanks in part to the well-written(and at times, humorous) plot and screenplay. Best sequel to a beloved superhero I've ever seen and by the impressively AMAZING box-office results, roll on Amazing Spiderman 3!!! Great job everyone!!! Great and AMAZING job!!!"
"khemka-vinit","8","4","12","11 May 2014"," Amazing experience...worthy of flick of the week
","This week's flick for me was Amazing Spider Man 2, which (awe & surprise might be for some ) was really amazing experience to visual senses. The plot was little bit shaky with director trying to accommodate too many characters in 120 min entwining their fate together and around our favorite Peter Parker . The stem of the movie is its love story of Gwen and Peter with things getting spiced up by super villains like Electro , Green Goblin & lastly with Huge armoured Rhino. The action sequences are fantastic with 3D effect which compliments them rather than taking all the credits . The slo mos are perfectly incorporated in fight sequences . With Wits and Humor just like you find in spideys comics ,the movie provides a peek inside Peter's family history also with describing the death of his parents at the beginning and Peter's search for his parent's past and untimely demise. However, the story Is little shaky as it tries to adrift from Peter to Max aka Electro , Harry Osborn, his aunt , but every time the director has dragged it strongly and beautifully to Peter & Gwen to make it a good movie that gaurantees you everything : Action , romance, comedy , fantasy & entertainment .<br/><br/>My Verdict : Get your a** up and go watch the movie."
"nagyistvanandor","3","8","31","7 May 2014"," For kids
","to sum up most simply the fails of the movie ""it was made for kids"" Not every superhero movie needs a Nolan tone, but that mainly means the movie dose not need to be dark and dramatic. But it dose need realistic characters, dialog, and a well phased story. <br/><br/>The first Amazing Spider-man was a weak okay, but I guess it had a free get out of jail card, since as long as it did not had a emo Peter Parker making a dance number on the street fans probably gived it a thumbs up. But now that luxury expired, and instead of improving on the first movie, it declined. Mainly two reasons which is close to each other.<br/><br/>1) the characters, they way they react, talk, and kinda the hole plot is written for kids. the only audience how enjoys the fast blabbering, unrealistic conversation style are kids and teenagers. And the hole logic of things seams to work in similar fashion. Like the laundry scene with Aunt May. Where she more like bullies peter, instead talking with him. its a kid view point adults are this rules who makes no sense. And other stupid things like now the green goblin is not just a armor, its a genetic disease -_-. But we have a father whos guessing in his 40-50ths dieing from it, and his soon hows between 18-20ish just learning that he has a ridicules genetic illness which works way faster in his body than in his dad.. logic? Or explanation of why?<br/><br/>2) Lazy, lazy, lazy uncreative and did i mentioned lazy writing? The hole plot is put together from predictable, uninspired clichés. If your a kid or teen and have not seen to many movies, the plot might surprise you, or get you involved. If your unfortunate enough to have seen many movies the desire to butthead the chair in front of you will build up rapidly. Like when its Gwen Stacey who gives the ""heartwarming"" ""original"" ""never been heard"" graduation speech. Which mainly just gived a heads up ""Oh so you going to kill her."" since what would be more cheese to have this character speak about life and future and clichés than kill her off. Than shortly after the break up -_- the forced drama of ""will they get back together tease"" is really old and terribly boring. And the fact you kill off the love interest soon after they get back together dose not spice it up. And thats like 10-20 minutes to the movie. <br/><br/>with all this said. The movie did managed to make some parts right. For example most of the time spider-man is portrayed very good, his confident, goofy, blubbery, dynamic. I don't mind seeing things like when he protected the kid, and inspired him by complimenting on the thing he made. Though they later scene with the kid should have been cut, or at least have rhino shoot Spider-man in the face when he just stands there for like 2 minutes. dumb stuff like this should not happen. Also even though Spider-man was good, Peter Parker was horrible character. I don't remember if he was this much of a ""Shia LaBeouf"" in the first one, but he sure was in this one. It did not worked in transformers and it sucks just as much in spider-man too.<br/><br/>Actually cutting out Mary Jane was a good idea. Cause the last thing we need it a clichéd romantic triangle on top of a boooooring clichéd on/off romance. And personally would welcome the fact if there would be no Mary Jane or other romance in the 3th movie. Im not really sure why Hollywood so clinged up on forcing romance in superhero movies it never really works. If you add romantic interest to rise the drama since your working with one slightly altered cliché it just adds boredom. Only way you can misfire more if your adding the romantic interest to apply to female audience. And the reasons: In most superhero movie the romantic interest is dimly drawn, eye candy, mostly kept around to cause conflict(for example breaking up for no real good reason or getting caught by the villain), and in the end be the reward for the superhero. Pretty sure most female audience appreciate that a lot. <br/><br/>So if you really want to include Mary Jane in the 3th movie try something different. Try a Batman-Alfred relation. Let Mary Jane be the stable point of Spiderman life, the only person knowing who he really is, there for the one he can turn for advice, or be the not involved party who can give a fresh look to the situation. And also can cover for him like J.J: Parker where the hell where you! MJ: He was with me...bla bla. And no way for a long time make the situation where Spiderman most save her from the villain. <br/><br/>So to sum it up. If your a kid or teenager probably you will love this movie and have a good time watching it. If your above avoid it, or if you must see it sneak in some alcohol and make a drinking game like: ""drink when a cliché happens"" ""drink when a character or plot point dose not make sense"" ""drink cause its just 20 minutes in the movie and your already bored and ripped out half of your hair"" etc"
"Solamortis","3","8","31","3 May 2014"," Disappointing Sequel !Spoiler Alert!
","Before going into detail the best way I can explain my thoughts about Spiderman 2 is to compare it to Star Wars II and III. The dialogue from Andrew Garfield felt just as wooden and contrived as many of Hayden Christensen's lines. When he was Peter Parker it was painful watching him. As Spiderman things felt more natural. <br/><br/>Jaimie Foxx is a great actor but the role as Electro/Max Dillon was not a good fit. In large part I believe this to be because of the atrocious writing. If they had given him a straight role instead of turning him into attempted comedy relief like Jar Jar Binks it may have been better.<br/><br/>While watching the character of Harry Osborn I kept having flash backs to Edward Furlong in Terminator 2. I don't know if it was the makeup or the acting.<br/><br/>Lastly what is it with remakes that requires the death of main characters? <br/><br/>Big Spoiler Alert!! Do you remember the first x-men series? Cyclops, Jean Grey and Prof X die. Unfortunately Spiderman 2 follows the same formula. Instead of writing a well developed story lets create small stories and kill off the loose ends so we don't have to deal with them. Norman Osborn...dead and to make room for a new love interest lets kill off Gwen Stacey too. I mean they already killed of her father.<br/><br/>The only moment in the movie that stood out was about 5 minutes from the end when a kid decides to fill in for Spidey. <br/><br/>All in all the money spent at the theater was a waste."
"hitchcockthelegend","6","3","8","24 September 2015"," Spider-Man stuffed once again.
","Marc Webb returns to direct what Sony had hoped was the second instalment of a longer running reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Writing this now, I'm armed with the knowledge that once again the web slinger will get another reboot in 2017, which after viewing this sequel comes as no surprise.<br/><br/>It's not so much that it's a bad film, or a bad Spider-Man film at that, it's just that it feels all very familiar, whilst simultaneously hugging the same pitfalls as Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. Webb tries to juggle a screenplay with 3 villains (well two and a half really), a tricky romance between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and of course there's school, a best friend and affairs of the home heart to deal with.<br/><br/>The introduction of Electro (Jamie Foxx) is a good move, inputting a new villain into the spidey world is most welcome. Yet in spite of Foxx earning some level of sympathy with the characterisation, it never really works and unfortunately draws comparisons with a certain Mr. Freeze from another franchise. Dane DeHaan comes in as Harry Osborn, soon to be Green Goblin, again the tortured soul act is well performed, but come Goblin time the make up and effects work is laughable. While Paul Giamati as Aleksei Sytsevich - cum - Rhino, is having fun but is barely in the picture.<br/><br/>Stone is the best thing in it by far, while Garfield works hard, but there is no getting away from the fact that they both are - and look - too old for their parts. The action is fun and pulse raising, but there's not enough of it to sustain a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes. Though on the plus side Webb and his team are to be applauded for choosing a story line that is ultimately bold and contains a great emotional whack. All told it's a shaky entry to the spidey world, one that once again forced Sony into another rethink. Lets hope the next journey spidey goes on has some clarity and streamlined sense. 6/10"
"jokerswild1","4","3","8","25 March 2015"," Lazily pieced together
","After seeing Peter's parents die in an action sequence you'd see in a low tier Bond film, we see Spider-Man battle a villain who seems like he'd be more suited to chasing Rocky and Bullwinkle. Once that villain is in check, we move on to Max Dillon, whose villainous potential is made clear in a scene straight out of Analyze This. The insecure nerd then gets electrical superpowers, and swears a vendetta against Spider-Man because he didn't recognize him right off the bat.<br/><br/>Damn. Well, who wouldn't, right?<br/><br/>The worst part of this movie is the villains. Fearless Leade-uh, I meant the Rhino, is just a cringeworthy cartoon cheeseball. Electro is probably the ""best"" villain of the movie, faint praise as that is. He has practically no motivation, but at least he's visually interesting. The Green Goblin looks like the lovechild of Johnny Rotten and a troll doll, and he arrives literally seconds after Electro is defeated. That's just extremely lazy writing.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield isn't that compelling or likable of a lead, although he's not terrible. He does have some chemistry with Emma Stone. The brighter aesthetics are more suitable for a Spider-Man film, a welcome change from the Batman-like aesthetics of The Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 3 also had a few coincidences in the storyline, but that film was still entertaining and had well-performed and depicted characters. Unlike this film, its merits outweighed its faults."
"Jalung14","4","3","8","6 March 2015"," Sony products with a hint of Spider-Man
","Now, I am a huge fan of Spider-man, I have been in love with the character since I was kicking the inside of my mother's stomach, but my God, this is a sin against humanity. Not up there like fatal stabbings (unless you count mentally) or anything thing like that, but a sin nonetheless.<br/><br/>I watched the First Amazing Spider-Man and really liked it: It was a different take on the story and felt really refreshing, like a glade air freshener trying to mask the putrid Bullsh*t that was Spider-Man 3 (Which I personally believe is Lucifer's pick for any film night he hosts). This sequel however, was nothing more than a Sony product vomiting cash cow that seemed to only have one goal in mind, Advance the story regardless of value in order to spawn more sequels for this now, dare I say, dead as f*ck franchise that Sony willingly ravaged just to get that money shot. <br/><br/>I am all for a huge Spider-Man franchise, but Goddamn. You cannot hurry up and sh*t out this crap just to make room for the gold you're planning to pull out of you ass.<br/><br/>Now on to my ""Disagreements"" with the film.<br/><br/>1. Countless plot holes: Electro's only motivation against Spider-Man is that he forgot his name? How could he right? in a city inhabited by 8.3 million people? Electro gets his powers from eels that live in water, and thats somehow his weakness? Why didn't Rhino just murder that child in the street along with Spider-Man? WHY would there be a crowd of people willing to stand near this mechanic behemoth with missiles, risking their lives, if not to conveniently witness Spider-Mans return?<br/><br/>I swear to God, an archer with Parkinson's is more consistent than this film.<br/><br/>2. Overload of Characters and their own plots: As mentioned previously, Sony basically used this movie in order to advance the plot (if thats what you call what they did here) so we could have more movies. In doing this, this film has become over encumbered with too many characters with too many subplots for one movie to tell, what follows is 3 or 4 (probably more, it got hard to keep count) different rushed stories about hollow characters that we haven't gotten enough time to give a damn about.<br/><br/>And 3. I do not give a sh*t about Peter's parents: Remember when uncle Ben was murdered in cold blood in the first Amazing Spider-Man? Yeah, Peter must not, considering he does't even look into past the first 45 minutes of the first movie. Instead, he's obsessed with finding out more of his piece of sh*t dad who he didn't even give a rat's ass for in the first movie. Also good to know I could have gotten to the movies 15 minutes late and still not missed a damn thing. <br/><br/>I gave this film 4 stars. Even with all that's wrong with the film, I still honestly think the Actors did a great job, given the material. I don't even blame Jaime Fox for the God awful puns (which are very reminiscent of Batman and Robin, I just threw up a little on my keyboard). Honestly I loved the entire cast. <br/><br/>Garfield Is a great Spider-Man, witty and clever with his quips. A lot of people say he's not a good Peter Parker, especially in this movie. In my opinion his Peter in the first movie was insanely accurate and, since becoming Spider-Man, has gained a lot of confidence in himself. Parker was not always the socially awkward nerd you see in the Sam Raimi Trilogy. He grows out adapts socially, especially after meeting Gwen. <br/><br/>Emma Stone as Gwen is perfect. Maybe it's the way the character was written, or Stone herself (I like to think a perfect combination of both), But This character is amazing. Gwen Stacy is smart, beautiful, willing to understand and overcome the roadblocks that come with dating Spider-Man, all while actually being a benefit to him on and off the battle field. It's rare to see a movie nowadays where there's a couple and neither really turns out to be the damsel in distress (Grant it, she's killed in this one, but not because she's an idiot.)<br/><br/>Garfield and Stone have an amazing chemistry which shows beyond the film, their scenes together are always well done and feel natural. This is one of the things that I loved about these new Spidey flicks, Which is exactly why I cried like a b*tch at the Clock tower scene.<br/><br/>I also absolutely loved Dane Dehaan's Goblin. It was creepy, visually terrifying, and just seem to work really well to me, especially with that nasally cackle he does. The only issue there is HE'S ONLY GIVEN 6 MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME LIKE THAT. Thinking back, all the things I really liked about this movie was a tease.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this movie yet, and are a Spidey fan, you'll love it, look back, start to realize it was a cinematic mistake, question your decision making skills, watch it again just to make sure, then go on to say it is in fact terrible, but you still kinda like it (At least that was my experience)<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this movie yet and aren't really a spider fan, Watch daredevil first, just so you're reminded that it could be worse."

","I knew right from the get-go that these movies would not at all be as good as the Tobey Maguire movies. But watching previews and trailers for this actually made it look promising: something the first one never had. Did the movie turn out to be as good as it looked? Not at all. What really hurt was that it had potential to be great. I knew it would not be as good as the old ones, but pretty close. I was fooled.<br/><br/>Not much has changed from the first. Peter and Gwen are still in a relationship that makes Channing Tatum look like Cary Grant. Peter himself is still a wannabe cool kid from One Direction and still looks for answers about his parents. Like the first, the story is forgettable. I don't remember if all the answers are given, and frankly I don't care. All subplots are forgettable too. But what makes the subplots different from the first was that they fell flat on their faces. The first one actually had good development and did not fall. Take Electro: totally awesome villain with a great build-up, then just goes away. Then there is Harry Osborne. I thought Dane DeHaan was a better Harry than James Franco and a better outcast than Andrew Garfield. Funny thing was, he was underdeveloped! How can an underdeveloped guy outdo so many people? Watch and see. When he became the Green Goblin, I thought he was nearly as good as Willem Dafoe. Just as Goblin/Harry were heating up, him too was tossed! Instead, they focus on Peter and Gwen. Peter delivers cheesier and stupider ""wit"" that make Jean-Claude Van Damme look like Humphrey Bogart. And Gwen's death? I laughed. Then I decided to re-watch that scene and I actually felt remorse. In theatres, I thought Garfield's crying was awful. It was good the second time. Other than that, all emotions failed by Garfield and Stone. I can't wait for the next movie Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone do that is not Spiderman and actually serious.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, Electro and the Green Goblin where great. They saved the movie. Plus the general action and special effects were awesome too. Maybe there was too much computer effects, but the way it enhanced the action and made it look all cartoony, yet real was great. It also improves on the shakiness and no-focus that the first one had.<br/><br/>So, the action, special effects and villains improved. The story, subplots, and main characters failed.<br/><br/>1.5/4"
"Reno-Rangan","6","3","8","31 August 2014"," At the lowest point in Spider-man movies.
","The second movie in the new Spider-man movie series that directed by Marc Webb. I doubt his potential after seeing this movie. I feel someone should take his position before it become too late. In the history of the Spider-man movies, from all the 6 this one is the worst. Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world, but failed to deliver another quality movie for the fans. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. The subplots were not placed in the right spots, kind of random appearance brings the chaos in understanding the story. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man. Maybe because it was too soon to reboot, I guess.<br/><br/>''You want to be the hero. And now you gotta pay the price.''<br/><br/>The first movie gave a decent re-start for the refreshed Spider-man movie series. And what happened here in this second installment was a disaster. The first thing is it was nearly a 2 and half an hour movie that brought me lightly a headache to carry on thus far. Actually, it was 10 minutes shorter than what it is now, but in the end they have developed a bit longer to show the opening scene of the third movie. When a movie got a powerful hero, it should have equally matched antagonist. If they are matched, then the fight between them are the next thing to bring the best out of it. I think the Electro man did not click as they have expected, at least not to me. The strength he had was something beyond spider-man, but did not unleash him in a perfect manner. Though Jamie Foxx was not bad in that avatar, the filmmakers kind of wasted his presence for not so good scenes.<br/><br/>Remember the original Spider-man was the modern superhero movies, I mean it was done using computer graphics. Afterwards 'Batman', 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and all were followed. I like the version with Tobey Maguire in it, though my rating declined by movie after another in the trilogy. This reboot series had a good opening, but failed to get the momentum going. Especially all the emotions were looked fakes that do not appeal like the original movie series did. Yes, it had a wonderful box office and that does not mean the movie is good, either worst. But expected a little better, especially in the negative characters. Andrew Garfield was good, not awesome, because most of his masked parts were CGI. Emma stone was another let down and could not help comparing her with Kristen Dunst, because she was no way near, at all. The Dane DeHaan role had the same issue and I don't know why people did not get better space in the movie that ran 140 minutes long. Like I said subplot spoiled everything I think. The digital 3D and stunts were poor. Yeah, there are many things to complain about it than to praise, but all the answer should come in the next sequel. If that makes bigger, not commercially, I mean with a good story, graphics and performances then there will be no problem. But if it fails, I had to say 'bring back the fourth installment of the original movie series'. Definitely not worth a watch, but anyway most of the guys going to watch it or already watched it."
"siderite","5","3","8","30 August 2014"," What a flop!
","I've read some of the reviews for the movie at IMDb and I am absolutely convinced that a lot of them are paid for. There are so many things wrong with this film that I cannot imagine someone liking it, not to mention calling it ""amazing"" and ""electrifying"".<br/><br/>The problems start from the very first scenes. You have some thugs stealing nuclear material from an armored truck, all the while driving in a huge tow truck that smashes through everything: police cars, normal cars, buses, you name it. What does Spidey do? He comes swinging and starts talking with the guy, making jokes all the while. Then we spend a quarter of a movie seeing him trying to push away the woman that he loves because she wants her safe, then coming back because he loves her too much. Meanwhile, all the people that he cares about or that he saves their lives seem to turn to pointless villains that want to kill him.<br/><br/>Are the special effects nice, then? They start off nice enough, but then they go so far into CGI land that it all feels like a Road Runner cartoon. Is the acting good? No! All the dialogues are so bad that you can actually see actors cringing while saying them. Action scenes? CGI overload. Logic? nonexistent. Science? Raped repeatedly. Moral of the story? Not there. There is no point in anything anyone does in the movie. They don't even have a post credits scene.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I like superhero and comic book fantasies and I think I can get in the spirit of things quite easily. After all, I watched every Spiderman movie so far, and they are all about a guy in pajamas swinging from building to build (when he is not whining - or dancing). I also realize that the concept itself is both difficult to promote in a modern world and to put in a live action film (that is why so many of them turn into CGI cartoons most of the time). However this film I couldn't not hate it. It is so bad in so many ways that I feel anger for having watched it. It's how I imagined the Mutant Teenage Ninja Turtles movie to be when I decided not to watch it. I shudder at the thought that it might be worse. Do. Not. Watch. This. Filth."

"pcrprimer","5","3","8","6 August 2014"," Uneven pacing and storytelling, that wastes some great performances
","The Amazing Spiderman never really found its stride, and this movie suffers from the same problem. This is really a shame, because Andrew Garfield really embodies the Spiderman character and Jaime Foxx tried with what he was given. Even though nobody would ever believe that Peter and Gwen are 18 year-olds, that isn't the main problem. The real issue stems from trying to jam too many characters into a single movie. Three villains were not really necessary, and movies can seldom handle 2 main villains (Excluding TDK). The volatile relationships of Peter Parker at this point have become too cliché, and is a reoccurring plot point in every Spiderman movie. The action scenes standout."

","I would say that this movie is a light one, for a rainy day, to just make the time pass faster, but unfortunately it is way too long and fairly boring for that. Too much drama, quite a few nonsensical scenes and too little action for an action movie. Key word: action. Been some time since i last took two smoke breaks while watching an action movie. People say the cast was great. Maybe. As in names. But the acting was wooden. Struggled. It just wasn't there. <br/><br/>On top of that, if i ever want to go on a diet, i would put a poster of Andrew Garfield on my fridge and whenever i see his face i will instantly loose all appetite.

"JoeKarlosi","5","3","8","24 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) **
","SPOILERS- I didn't really need or want to see this, but I had a few hours to kill one afternoon and this was the most accessible movie at the theater. It's not that I don't appreciate Spidey; I grew up a fan of Marvel and Spider-Man, and I had seen the first three Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films already. When Andrew Garfield played the part again in yet another needless reboot called THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN two years ago, I refused to bother, so soon after Sam Raimi had already done a new series. I found that as much as I don't think much of Tobey, I thought he still had made a better Peter Parker than Garfield.<br/><br/>Let's get down to business. So this Part 2 of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN was about what I expected, no less -- but also, unfortunately, nothing more. Typically overdone special effects... a movie that feels way too long, with too many climaxes... and also trying to cram in too many bad villains for one movie (so what else is new in Superhero Cinema?). To begin, Jamie Foxx is ridiculous as a sniveling Max Dillon, who turns into ""Electro"". I couldn't believe we had to sit through yet ANOTHER take on ""The Green Goblin"" (Dane DeHaan)... come on, with all the classic Spidey villains over the decades, must you rely on a character we've already seen in the last recent series? And the final joke of all was a completely out-of-place tacked-on climax with Paul Giamatti as a thug in an over-sized mechanical robot contraption, who is allegedly supposed to be ""The Rhino"" (I remember The Rhino from the comics -- and this metallic monstrosity looked more like J. Jonah Jameson's ""Spidey Slayer"", or the one that Thunderbolt Ross manipulated to thwart The Incredible Hulk!). And speaking of J. Jonah Jameson... where the hell was he in this picture, anyway? He was a vital part of Spider-Man. Was he in the first movie? Not that I'm going to see it.<br/><br/>Sally Field is a terrific actress, and she tries hard in this movie as Peter's old Aunt May. The only problem is, she doesn't really look or feel anything like the real Aunt May from the comics, and -- I hope Sally will appreciate this -- she's not old-looking enough. Or maybe I'm just still used to seeing that sweet and chubby little face as GIDGET or THE FLYING NUN.<br/><br/>Emma Stone was okay, I guess. Nothing that stood out, certainly, in her performance as Gwen Stacy. The one kudo I'll give to the film (can we still call these things ""films"" nowadays, or are they now ""digitals""?) is that I was crossing my fingers that Gwen would meet her death like she did from the comics, and I'm glad the movie did not waffle there; however, her death scene was so over-staged and sensationalized: falling, falling, falling, falling...still falling! ... amidst slow-motion, in mid-air drama...with cartoon debris effects littered and flying all about the air... Enough. ** out of ****"
"jordan-dark136","5","3","8","21 May 2014"," Less Than Amazing
","I really liked the first movie. I am a big Andrew Garfield fan and I thought he did a Mich better job in the role than Tobey Maguire ever even attempted. Basically, I just liked the reboot, even though it seemed completely unnecessary. However, this movie has slipped back from the wonderful chemistry and comedy that we saw in the last film into the cheesy one liners and villains with positively laughable back stories of the old series. Besides the script, which is terrible to say the least and was obviously written by someone who very much wishes they were as clever as Joss Whedon, and the general sportiness of the plot in general, it is a decent movie. But compared to the greatness achieved in the first film, its sub par. Here is my main issue with this movie: the vagueness of it all. Everything in this movie is toned down, from the comedy to the random Phillip Phillips induced question web. Nothing the characters do or say really makes sense with what they did and said in the first film. God help them, because Andrew and Emma really are trying. They're both brilliant actors, they just have possibly the worst script in the world to work with. Another issue with this film are its two villains (that's right, two!). My friend and I who watched the film together dubbed them Insta-Villains. Jamie Foxx is a decent actor, and he pulls off the psychotic Spiderman obsession quite well, but his transition into Electro and Electro's development into a supervillain is very...instant. Within fifteen minutes of us knowing his character he has already been dunked in a tank of radioactive eels and turned blue. And within ten minutes of that, he is blasting apart Times Square to the tune of quite possibly the stupidest made- for-movie song I have ever laid ears upon. And then there's Harry Osbourne. I get that they wanted this movie to be a different version of the Green Goblin, but they changed everything they could get their hands on. I was never a fan of James Franco's Harry, but at least his character development into the Goblin made sense. Dane Dehaan is yet another example of talent laid to waste in this film. You can tell he is really trying, but the scenes between Harry and Peter are dry and unbelievable to say the least. And his transition from calm and calculated heir to Oscorp to infidel is cheesier than pure cheese. I despised that they haphazardly threw in the Goblin in the last ten minutes of the film. It was a literal exasperated ""oh there's another one"" moment. On a good note (and a sad one) Gwen's death was the only thing that actually triggered emotions while I was watching this movie. Andrew's performance is absolutely heartbreaking. So here's what I have to say. This was a decent film, but they really need to write more like the first movie and stop trying to be Joss Whedon. The soundtrack was AWFUL, that song that accompanied Electro's villain transition was positively dreadful. Please don't do that again. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have good chemistry as always, but it's laid to waste by the terrible script. All in all, it's not really worth going to see in theaters. Maybe rent it once the DVDs are released. I really hope they do better in the next film."
"master-erik_95","6","3","8","18 May 2014"," An over-ambitious and overlong blockbuster sequel
","Despite the decidedly mixed reaction to 2012's reboot, I appreciated the film although I still very much preferred Sam Raimi's debut film. However, it's an entirely different matter when it comes to my opinion on this film. Besides the obvious argument that a sequel to an already unnecessary reboot is even more unnecessary, this film still had an unlimited amount of potential in terms of character development and exploring intersecting story lines. And to be honest, it does try to do this, maybe too much on the intersecting story lines aspect, but it never manages a balance between an individual story and the overarching storyline already slated for the upcoming Sinister Six spin-offs.<br/><br/>The result is a mess of a plot, an utterly waste of over-the-top in a bad way cliché villains with even more cliché motivations, numerous jarring tonal shifts which already affect the film when it's started barely ten minutes ago. For instance, the opening chase sequence featuring an throwaway cameo by the great Paul Giamatti, here utterly wasted as an constantly screaming villain with a terrible Russian accent, shifts constantly between trying to be suspenseful, funny, dramatic and violent all at once. Certainly the fault lies in Marc Webb's inconsistent direction throughout the entire film and his inability to decently and creatively stage an action sequence and Pietro Scalia's choppy editing, which takes out the entire momentum of this 142 minute long film, trying to make an epic superhero film out of one that really didn't need to be all that big.<br/><br/>On the positive side, most of the acting performances are still solid, particularly Garfield, Stone and Field, even though they can't make miracles with the cliché-ridden script they've being handed to. DeHaan's performance suffers from being provided with a whiny and underdeveloped character, and Jamie Foxx, another great character actor, is also terribly wasted here as the one dimensional Electro.<br/><br/>But most importantly, because of trying to be so many films at once, forgets the most important element the previous Spider-Man films had, even Spider-Man 3, despite its undeniable flaws; the human aspect. The only scenes that really touch this are any between Garfield and Stone, but despite their undeniable chemistry, they also end up becoming nothing more than a tiresome on and off couple, which undermines the proceedings since we already know the ending of it.<br/><br/>If Sony wishes to make the next film work, they better come to realize that sometimes, less is better."
"childish-phantom","7","3","8","16 May 2014"," This is Spider-man film or I just watch another Teen Fiilm?
","I can't say I went in to the theater with high hopes. The first reboot, I kind of like it. But like my guess, this TASM 2 mess every thing up. After seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film. <br/><br/>Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and a blue electric guy. Their love scene is to much for me, It like see another Twilight film in the theater. I don't like Mary Jame of the first trilogy, but still love the emotion from Peter to her. <br/><br/>And About the villain, Electro - stupid, dumb ass, don't know any word to described it. Green Globin - Jerk, Peter don't give you his blood so you wanna kill him, after use the poison you still wanna kill him WTF. With this villain, how it can't be better than the old Spider-man 3.<br/><br/>The point I like is the battle, yeah It is good, can't deny it. Spider man is funnier, smarter, but can't look like a nerd in comic book so good like Tobey, and how this nerd can't make the most beautiful girl in the school love him, show me please :D. But CGI look like a video game. Can't wain the last of this mess up Trilogy."
"Critomaton","4","3","8","15 May 2014"," The Angsty Spider-Man is Shockingly Bad
","I ignored the reviews that criticized this movie for its similarities to Twilight. They were right and I was wrong. I ignored the reviews that complained about the lack of action and the underdevelopment of all of the major villains. They were right and I was wrong. I ignored the reviews that complained that it seems like the director was more interested in reeling you back into the theater 2 years from now than telling an interesting story this time out. They were right and I was wrong.<br/><br/>I ignored all those reviews and went to see this anyway because I really liked The Amazing Spider-Man and thought most criticism of it was off-base. I liked its take on the origin story (subtler and less colorful than Raimi's version but somehow equally powerful), and I liked that most of the Spider-Man scenes looked like a real guy in a suit. Raimi's versions were ruined by the ultra-cartoony fakeness. <br/><br/>I also liked Andrew Garfield's take on both Peter and Spidey much better than Tobey Maguire's. If there was a weak link in TAS-M it was the choice of villain, not to mention his casting and rendering. I'm sick of British-sounding villains already and he just wasn't lizardy-looking enough. <br/><br/>But TAS-M2 just drags and drags. The make-up/break-up, on-again/off-again romance between Peter and Gwen, not to mention the bromance between Peter and Harry, is nothing short of tedious. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a completely uninspiring tow-truck chase, notable only because (I think) Paul Giamatti was driving the truck. <br/><br/>The first encounter with Electro - which happens way too far into the movie - is interesting as Spidey tries to use psychology to calm down his foe. It doesn't work of course. <br/><br/>Then there is a completely throw-away scene where Harry helps Electro escape and an even more worthless scene where Electro blasts some office furniture but still can't manage to intimidate the blatantly treacherous corporate back-stabber at Oscorp. <br/><br/>Then there is some big battle at a nondescript power plant where Electro buys the (wind) farm. And after that it gets even worse...<br/><br/>The only thing TASM-2 does well is that the stunts and effects continue to be much more convincing than any in the Raimi series (even when you know they must be CGI). Spidey usually looks like a guy in a suit doing really impressive stunts. But that can't make up for what is otherwise a very disappointing sequel and a near-the-bottom-of-the-heap superhero movie. I'd rate it as one of Marvel's worst, just above the Hulks and Fantastic Fours (and actually, even the first FF is probably more enjoyable). <br/><br/>The buildup to the Green Goblin reveal/transformation doesn't pay off at all. Some guy who looks like Leo DiCaprio with a Hitler haircut gets some Parker DNA, develops a bad case of acne, and crawls into a mech suit. I didn't have a stopwatch going but I think the Green Goblin got defeated less than 5 minutes after making his first appearance. <br/><br/>Although Willem Dafoe was an excellent casting choice, I was always disappointed that Raimi's Green Goblin was really just an armor suit. Well, TASM-2 messed things up even worse. The Green Goblin this time was disfigured, but he just didn't look menacing or even much like a goblin. And the only thing worse than a Green Goblin that is just a mech suit is a Rhino that is just a mech suit...<br/><br/>**MAJOR SPOILER ALERT** By the time Gwen Stacy died and Peter-Man was bawling over it, I was so sick of all the emoting in the movie that I literally felt nothing. And I cried at the Saturn commercial when that guy was empowered to pull the rope and stop the assembly line just to maintain quality, so I'm easily moved (where is Saturn now, by the way?) <br/><br/>Thanks for nothing, Marc Webb! You ruined Spider-Man in only 2 movies! It took Sam Raimi 3 tries to wear out his welcome (at least for most people - I was sick of the cartoon effects by the second time I watched the first Maguire outing). <br/><br/>In no particular order, here are four other annoying aspects of the movie:<br/><br/>1) The (ab)use of the classic 60's Spider-Man cartoon theme song as Peter's cell phone ringtone. It's not a clever homage, it's an irritating anachronism.<br/><br/>2) OK, we all saw that it's a Sony picture, so the constant use of VAIO laptops doesn't seem like legitimate product placement but rather some creepy form of nepotism (and I am writing this review on a VAIO laptop!)<br/><br/>3) What's with all the police cars? Was this NYPD product placement? There were more NYPD patrol cars crashed in this movie than in The Blues Brothers. Aren't there any other vehicles in New York? Or anything else to smash? Is this supposed to reinforce the idea that police are ineffective against super-villains? <br/><br/>4) The voices in Max Dillon's head probably drove me crazier than they drove him. And, yes, the reviews were also right about Jamie Foxx being unconvincing. I generally like Jamie as an actor, but this role did him no favors. Jim Carrey was better as the Riddler.<br/><br/>That last thought led me to another while watching this movie. The Marvel universe may have the coolest superheroes, but the DC universe sure seems to have the more interesting villains... at least judging by major motion pictures. Give me Gorilla Grodd over the tepid trio in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 any day of the week."

","** This review contains some minor spoilers, please do not read before watching the movie.**<br/><br/>I went to the cinema with high hopes. I liked the first installment of the new series and the trailers (the many, many trailers) looked very good. Sadly, like so many trailers, it contains all the actions sequences. If you go in for the action just watch the trailers, you'll have seen it all. <br/><br/>This movie, for the most part, is a chick flick. The on/off relationship between Peter and Gwen gets really old really fast and does not stop throughout the movie. This movie also contains way too many incoherent set-ups to future movies like ASM3 and Sinister Six. It will make no sense to people unfamiliar with the Spider-man universe. The main Villains are flat and under developed to make way for the endless sob story. Electro is a caricature, good performance by Jamie Foxx, very badly scripted. Harry/Green Goblin is way too rushed and squished together in the end. <br/><br/>It really feels like the few action sequences were an annoying disturbance for a director who wants to create a nice romantic comedy. <br/><br/>On the plus side. I really like Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-man. I also like this version of Spider-man that has humor and the way he moves is, for me, spot on. Just like the suit, really good. Dance deHaan was nice as Harry/Green Goblin but again the Goblin part was way too short.<br/><br/>During the movie I found myself playing with my 3D glasses and looking at my watch, that is never a good sign."

","I'll keep it short. I think this movie was highly entertaining and delivered the goods. Some of the scenes including Dane DeHaan (who steals the show with an amazing performance, btw) are perhaps some of the most intense scenes I've ever come across in a superhero film. Only complaints are that I wish a teensy weensy little less was focused on the constant on-off relationship between Peter and Gwen and that Electro was rather underwritten (how he obtains his powers is clichéd). However, those are just tiny nitpicks. With a good plot filled with emotion and intensity, and power-packed action sequences, this movie is officially my favorite Spiderman film and is also one of my favorite films ever.

"khanhtung111","5","3","8","14 May 2014"," Disappointing overall
","The only really 'amazing' thing out of this title is the FX. Really impressive and expressive also. The capture of Electro's and Spiderman's movement during the final fight is really on-point and it feels as real as it could be.<br/><br/>+ Plot: However, it seems like that's all the efforts the crew wanted to put in. The overall concept of the plot is pretty typical (which is not essentially bad but not really that outstanding either), however the way the director and the screenwriter attempted to expand it is horrible. At times it feels like the screenwriter simply jotted down a couple of notes of things that he wanted to put into the script then just patch them up in a very awkward way. Basically there was no SIGNIFICANT climax and the plot just wandered off most of the time. The conflict between the protagonist (Spiderman) and the antagonists (Green Goblin/Electro) somehow is not intensified to the point that they would really hold an urge to kill/stop each other. It's just like the Director was saying ""Hey Spiderman and Electro, you guys have the power to make a fight, so just go ahead and do it"". The pre-ending is just straight out terrible as it serves no real purpose. The death of Gwen basically means nothing at all (unless it's intentional by the Director to open up something else in the next franchise, but personally I don't think so). <br/><br/>Quality: 3/10<br/><br/>+ Acting: I like Emma Stone for what she did in Crazy, Stupid, Love and Superbad and she does seem to be a much capable actress than what she did in this movie. For some reason, she seems to be off-track with this character, while Gwen is supposed to be an independent, strong-willed and yet emotional character, Emma just delivered an average amount of those. Compared to what Kirsten Dunst did with Mary Jane, Emma totally fell short in what she has done. 5/10<br/><br/>I don't really understand the decision behind casting Jamie Foxx for the role of Electro. Yes he's a decent actor and all but it feels like he's not the man for the job. He tried to portray an kind of anti-social nerdy guy, but seriously he doesn't really have a face for it. It's like you try to put Chris Rock in one of those teenage romance dramas, it simply doesn't fit. 2/10<br/><br/>I don't have much impression on Andrew Garfield and Dane DeHane because it feels their shortcomings are not actually from their acting, but from a really weak plot that doesn't really stress them enough. For a superhero movie, whether you want to put the main character through a roller-coaster of climaxes of emotions (as in Dark Knight) or in the middle of an epic battle (Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Marc Webb wanted to do both, but it turned out that he failed in both of the fields. And the excessive amount of supposedly-humorous jokes and taunting that Spiderman threw around is just plain annoying. They might be good for some other characters like Hancock or Flash, but not in this case. 4/10 Same for Dane, he did seem to put a lot of effort in portraying a desperate young man crumbling under the immense pressure of running the biggest corporation in the world and trying to find a way to cure his disease. But since Marc Webb were unsure whether to put him in the front or in the back-line, all he did was just a bit of this and that.4/10<br/><br/>Overall I would give this title a 4/10, mostly thanks to the amazing visual effects that were employed. However, since such thing is so common in mainstream movies nowadays, Marc Webb really does have a lot to prove that he really knows how to handle such a massive-budget movie."

","I am a big Spider-man fan, but never really felt like any of the movies really hit the mark, but Spider-man 2 came closest.<br/><br/>I'm really disappointed with The Amazing Spider-man 2, most of all because it had so many good things going for it, but ultimately ends up feeling like a bad movie because for every good thing, there are 5 bad things.<br/><br/>First the good: Most of the casting choices are very good, especially for Peter, Gwen and Harry. The costume looks awesome (most of the time, some times it's waaay to shiny) The relationships between Peter and Gwen and also between Peter and Harry, feel real. Interesting visual palet. The Gwen climax is pretty good.<br/><br/>The Bad: The Max character is just plain stupid, and feels like something straight out of Batman and Robin. The Electro character lacks any real personality or motivation. The Rhino character is perhaps even more stupid than the Max character. Both before and after becoming Rhino. The romance between Peter and Gwen can be a bit too much at times and almost feel like a twilight movie covered with a little Spider-man paint. The doctor Kafka character is also insanely stupid. The movie is so busy building up to the sinister six movie, that this movie forgets to have a plot of it's own and all the interesting story lines that are started in the movie, never reaches a fulfilling end. The little kid in the spider-man costume, feels ridiculous and annoying. People constantly lining up right next where Spider-man is fighting the villains, with no concern for their own safety, and the villains never attack them...apparently because they are standing behind a safety railing...and who the hell puts up all these safety railings so fast every time Spiderman fights. All of the sinister six characters are just some equipment created by Oscorp, essentially making all the characters behind the villains completely irrelevant, as anyone can be the Rhino or Doc Ock. Peters mother and father flee and leave Peter behind to protect him, which makes no sense as in more danger left alone.<br/><br/>The worst part is that I could easily keep listing bad things.<br/><br/>The movie gets some things right, but also takes hugs steps backwards towards the stupid campy superhero movies like Batman and Robin.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"

At the very end of the film, Spidey finally starts the fight with the Rhino, but of course it had a cliff hanger ending, and the final scene where Spidey was about to smack rhino in the face, that was also the last scene in the trailer!!!! I hate cliff hangers. But other than those things, this movie was intense and Gwen's death was so sad. That entire scene gave me goosebumps! <br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review!"

","Doesn't there seem to be a formula brewing with these super-hero movies? Visually stunning....yes....multiple sequels...yes....start from the beginning with a new cast....yes. Same old story....yes. I guess it is not made to be taken too seriously, considering all the characters are taken from comic books, and I'm a sucker for comic books, but after three Iron Man, two Thor, two Hulks, two Captain America, two Fantastic Four, only one Avenger (more to come), the X-Men doesn't seem to go away,three Spiderman's, and now two more...am I missing any?? Oh yeh, how can I forget...Batman, Superman....not as big of a DC fan anyways...Well lets just say the novelty has worn a bit thin in my eyes. What used to be a must-see flick, many I now just wait for them to come out on Redbox, although with a bored son on a Sunday afternoon I walked into a packed house for Spiderman. Fun enough, but Redbox worthy. Save the XXX$."
"amypjs2","9","3","8","8 May 2014"," Good take on the COMIC
","**Ranting and a LOT of spoilers!!! OK, I don't know what is with everyone giving this movie such a bad review, but lighten up already! Aren't you supposed to go to see movies and have a good time? Of course it's not going to be extremely realistic or anything like that, unless you're seeing a documentary, IT'S A FICTION MOVIE!!! I am a huge Spider-Man fan, mainly from reading a lot of the comics when I was younger and I feel like this reboot is doing very well with comparing it to the Amazing Spider-Man series. I could say that it's completely inaccurate of how Electro is portrayed - he's green and yellow in the Amazing Spider-Man comics, he also got his powers by being struck by lightning. Did that happen to him? No. But I think what they came up with was somewhat interesting. I've also seen people review about how the character for Maxwell Dillon was such a stereotypical nerd, but how else would they have done it? I thought the character was perfect before he turned into Electro. Also, The Rhino is not a guy in a robotic suit either.<br/><br/>I'm seeing reviews about people getting mad about them killing off Gwen Stacy. Guess what? It wasn't the writer or director. If you guys actually read the comics, IT HAPPENS IN THE COMIC BOOK SERIES. I personally think it happened one movie too soon, but I knew it was coming. And trust me, I hate MJ as much as any other Gwen Stacy fan out there, but guess what? We can't stop her from coming back to this reboot even though her character already had three movies of her own in the original trilogy of Spider-Man. They actually killed Gwen Stacy pretty accurately too. I was very worried they were going to do something completely different and terrible. She dies by hitting her head due to Spidey's web catching her too late in the movie. In the comic she dies by snapping her neck from the impact of Spidey's web catching her. Close enough, and I was OK with that. I feel like they decided to kill her in this movie rather than the third or fourth because she was such a likable character, they didn't want people getting too attached; people seeing the movie would have probably gotten a lot angrier too.<br/><br/>Just watch this movie with an open mind, I also feel like people would understand what's going on even more if they read the comic series that this reboot is based off of."

","I've been looking forward to this movie for quite a while. I really enjoyed the first of the franchise and thought they really nailed Peter Parker and Spidey.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a pretty solid, super hero action flick. The film looks great, the action sequences are good and you are (in your head) cheering Spidey on! That being said I found Max/Electro a pretty dorky villain. I'm not convinced he has enough of a reason to use his newly found powers they way he does. The crescendo also came across a little half baked in points.<br/><br/>There are some nice references in there for comic book fans to spot.<br/><br/>All in all it's a fun ride and fans of the first will no doubt enjoy it. Just don't expect it to break the molds of the superhero genre."

","To me, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was quite better than the original. It had great action, fantastic visuals and special effects, decent humor and good character development. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy felt like a soap opera, whereas this has the right amount of drama that it feels even with the storyline. Not long after fighting The Lizard, it's time for Peter Parker and his fellow classmates to graduate. Peter still feels guilty about the death of Gwen's father.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a nerdy maintenance man who works at OsCorp named Max Dillon falls into a tank of genetically modified electric eels and becomes able to control anything that runs on electricity. (Jamie Foxx made an 'electrifying' villain. He starts out really dorky and becomes awesomely tough by the end of the film) Max idolizes Spider-Man, but when Max is labeled as a villain due to his appearance, the people of New York hate him and want Spider-Man to destroy him. Spider-Man must not only deal with Electro and a new Green Goblin, but must face the idea that he may never see Gwen again as she wants to go to school in England. This is the first summer blockbuster of 2014 in my opinion. I highly recommend THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2!!!"

","If your looking for and only looking for a Spiderman 2 then turn around and don't look back. Don't get me wrong this movie was very good, but if you have a choice on a Friday movie night and you had a choice between those two movies you would pick the original spider man 2. This is only holds true because I mean lets face it you have to be AMAZING to be better than Spidey 2.<br/><br/>Lets face it going in to this movie after the last one I kept thinking to myself there is no way in hell this is going to be remotely good and lets face it guys I was really wrong. I mean again coming in it was going to be a (pardon my french) 2 hour and 22 minute sit on your ass and check your phone every ten minutes type of movie, but I indulged myself anyway. <br/><br/>Little did I know that Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield's chemistry and overall just acting skill really just brings this up to an almost and probably outstanding film. I mean they are dating in real life and I almost was brought to tears with the big ending. I love the moments between them it makes you feel great inside. There is just a few things that really brought this down. You know them when you see them, but they are very minute things. <br/><br/>One, again it wasn't check your phone a lot, but it was a really really long movie. Two out of nowhere Harry and Peter are just like best friends like couldn't they have done a cameo in the FIRST Amazing Spiderman film. The last thing I have to say is that it has a overall great feel and amazing point of making up for the first film. 9/10 for sure but if IMDb did decimals it would be like a 9.2 . Loved it and a great movie for everyone. This is a must recommend movie best movie i've seen to kick off the summer months. Let's go Spidey 2!!!!!!"
"monstermayhem32","8","3","8","6 May 2014"," follow up very decent despite flaws
","When watching the amazing spiderman, it felt as though it was like watching what would have been the fourth spiderman raimi film except it was a reboot. However the sequel manages to make the sequel it's own despite borrowing certain concepts from the original spiderman 2 aka Harry Osborn. I do wish that chris cooper would have been given more on screen time since he did a decent job playing the role differently than willem Defoe did back in 2002. Dane dehaans transformation into the goblin was rather creepy, even though I liked Jamie Foxx as electro but wish there would have been a stronger motivation for his actions than thinking spiderman betrayed. I was also quite sad when Gwen Stacy suffered a terrible fate despite the chemistry between Emma stone and Andrew Garfield. There was also a lot of product placement and a cliffhanger setting up the events of the third film."
"jardinswingler","Null","3","8","3 May 2014"," OMG Marvel or should I say Disney
",":::::This may contain Spoilers::::::<br/><br/>Ahhh where do I begin? OK I'm on the fence about this movie. Now before you read this just to let you know. The 1st amazing Spiderman Brilliant seen it 10 times 3 in theater. The crappy McGuire Spiderman's utter trash it felt like Dawson's Creek. Now this movie is not as bad as everyone says it is but it's not as good as it should have been. <br/><br/>Special Effects amazing, (Jamie Foxx) Brilliant Decision in casting him and also his performance spot on. Dehann also Brilliant Decision in casting him for Green Goblin and excellent facial costuming. Paul Giamtti also brilliant casting perfect attitude he showed emotion playing as Rhino' char.. Then they added Felicia (AKA Black Cat), Felicia for now. And also if you watch closely I believe it's the 2nd to 3rd scene on Osborne's Computer when he's accesses the SD for the 1st time you see the Symbient suit (AKA Venom) as one of the documents on the SD card it's small so u you really have to look at it very closely. And Gwen And Garfields's performance and chemistry excellent they even added the FACT that she does die cause it happened in the comics, not this early she goes to England 1st and then dies much later but to make room for either (MJ) or (Felicia). I see why they killed her off. And for those ppl who don't know? Parker dates them both..... suppose to anyway but ends up w MJ. <br/><br/>Now the bad,, the fight scenes were warranted with Electro everyone of them but they were to focused on Jamie Fox's char. and did not spend enough time on the other super villains RHINO, GREEN GOBLIN,. What they should have done was make the movie at least 3 hrs. and I'll tell you y. They spent hardly no time at ALL on RHINO if you've watched the trailer w Rhino that's all you see of him literally they cut the movie out right after the disc throw, end movie. That is utter crap. No fight scene w rhino. Now another fact Peter's father is suppose to be Secret agent as a matter of fact (LOGAN) new Peter's father, but they said he's a renown scientist in this movie. OK I could let that slide. But here's the kicker they were suppose to add a scene that Marvel always usually does at the end of the movie instead. It's a bloody clip of X-MEN Days of Future Past. Really are you kidding me no extended scene regarding Spiderman no scene where maybe at the end he finds the Symbiot suit nothing like that instead a clip Of X-MEN or should I just say HUGH JACkMAN's Wolverine 3 cause if you noticed that's all you see is him commercializing the entire movie, what about the other X-men. Storm Havoc, that's another review all by itself. <br/><br/>Disney please sell the right's back to originality back to whomever could do Marvel Comic movies good again. Stop trying to please the 6 yr old. U have true fans that your letting down. <br/><br/>And this was definitely a let down however not as bad as some of the reviews whom aren't to familiar w the story line just speaking about the movie itself. Please take some time to learn the storyline."
"dreamtowngirl","Null","3","8","2 May 2014"," Amazing, but quite unoriginal and brings up some déjà vu moments
","I just went to see The Amazing Spider-Man 2 last night with friends. We went to see the 3D version. Overall, the movie was great, it was totally worth the ticket. So if you folks wanna see the movie, I really do think you should see the 3D version.<br/><br/>I loved the movie generally. However on the down side, I would say this movie is (a): déjà vu; unoriginal; cliché. Let's start from the beginning.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Spider-Man catching the bad guy in the street of New York City, being all cool and witty that he is. This scene is so amazing in terms of special effects. You'll see a bunch of things flying at you (classic 3D trick, but hey, it's still entertaining to watch!). They sometimes slow things down a bit so the audience can feel the 3D effects.<br/><br/>While webbing the bad guy, Spider-Man whistles the Spider-Man original theme song, which reminds me of Sam Raimi's version of Spider-Man (the one with Tobey Maguire). If you remember it, the second movie of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is also the first of the series to introduce the theme song.<br/><br/>In the mean time, Gwen Stacy is at her graduation ceremony. She delivers a brilliant speech about how immortality is one of the reasons why your life is important, and a bunch of things that normally wouldn't be in a high school graduation speech.<br/><br/>Then drama drama drama. Peter and Gwen break up, then they become friends again but can't really move on, oh Harry Osborn appears and he's so handsome and all.<br/><br/>Anyway, Harry in this movie is dying from some kind of illness that he got from his father, Norman Osborn. And the only way he thinks he can be cured is by getting bitten by a spider. In this case, getting bitten by the spider that bit Peter Parker who now has super power similar with a spider. But the spider species has been killed by the OsCorp long ago. So now his only chance is to get the spider's DNA which is in the Spider-Man's DNA.<br/><br/>Thinking that Peter is friends with Spider-Man, Harry asks Peter to talk to Spider-Man to donate his blood to Harry. Peter says no because he knows there is a high possibility their blood isn't compatible and that Harry could die from it. But then after a bit of a begging, Peter says he'll try to help him. So then Spider-Man shows up in Harry's mansion, only to say he refuses to donate his blood.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we learn that a guy named Max Dillon has once been saved by Spider-Man in the first scene. Max is sort of a sociopath who has no friends and feels invisible. But after his encounter with Spider-Man, he starts to feel confident, thinking that he's special to Spider-Man.<br/><br/>One day, on his birthday, he gets electrocuted inside the OsCorp laboratory. Then he falls into a tank full of genetically modified electric eels, in which he gets electrocuted again. And then he turns into this monster named Electro. Electro is basically a living electric generator that works like a battery. He controls the electricity around him and uses that to attack people and buildings.<br/><br/>But Max isn't a bad guy. At first. He is just confused with what happened to him, so he wanders in the Times Square to search for answers. He meets Spider-Man there, and Spidey tells the cops not to attack him. Max explains that he feels happy that he's friends with Spidey, and he looks very happy to see his face on the billboards. But then again, a stupid human cop decides to pull the trigger, which angers Electro/Max (really, in every movie. Can't you human cops learn that your human-made guns are nothing compared to those genetically mutated monsters?).<br/><br/>Anyway, Max starts attacking people again, but Spidey manages to stop him using water that basically messes electricity up. Then Max is brought to a lab, and is being studied there. The lab people want to see how much energy Electro can power.<br/><br/>Now let's get back to Harry Osborn who's now desperate to find cure to his illness. He finds out that there is still a left over DNA of the spider in the secret lab. So he goes to the lab that has Electro in it, helps Electro escape, and goes to the OsCorp to steal the left over DNA with the help of Electro.<br/><br/>This time, we learn that Peter manages to find a video that his parents stored in an abandoned subway. In the video, Richard Parker explains that the OsCorp betrays him and his wife, Mary. He also says he has secretly done something with the DNA of the spiders to only match his bloodline DNA. So if Norman Osborn or his bloodline ever tries to get injected with the spider's DNA, they'll die or something bad will happen.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to Harry in the OsCorp. He's now injecting the DNA into his body, and he starts transforming into the Green Goblin (déjà vu much?). So then he starts being mean to people. Then there's fighting scene, which is great. It's very hard to describe a fighting scene in words, so I'm just going to skip to the end. Gwen Stacy dies. If you watch the movie, the movie itself is already giving away some hints that Gwen is going to die. The graduation speech, the going away to Oxford together. And to be honest, I think the process of building up the momentum of her death is sort of cliché. Harry survives and is now being incapacitated in a mental asylum. Spider-Man takes a break from saving the city, until a giant rhino guy appears and starts messing around. Then Spider-Man re-appears and defends the city. All in all, it's a good ending."
"curtiswberry","7","3","8","2 May 2014"," meh
","Fight scenes were great. Development of relationship between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker was good. Establishment of relationship between Harry and Peter was clipped and hollow. Electro was OK. Going from fidgety, nervous nobody to imposing deep-voiced super villain so quickly seemed silly. Goblin development was rushed.<br/><br/>Another visual feast where the writers tried to make up for what they felt was a weak story line by jamming as many thing as possible in the 2h 22min film. Have faith in the material and the audience's ability to follow a complex story line, gentlemen.<br/><br/>At this rate, Spidey will be fighting about 10 villains in Spideman 3. Oh well, better to have a Spidey flick than no Spidey flick."

","Fact - this will make tons of money all over, and those Sinister 6 and other side/sequels will get made, no matter what. Fact - this is wayy inferior to this summer's 'Captain America 2: The Winter soldier', and there are better summer movies coming along (perhaps). Fact - this is definitely inferior in quality to both of Sam Raimi's versions, but might match up to the quality of his much-reviled 3rd one. Fact - effects-wise, this has to be the best trip to the big screen that the wall-crawler has ever had, to date. Pity. Along with that, the final 15/20 minutes (minus the last 5) kinda redeem the movie as a whole, but are not enough overall. More's the pity.<br/><br/>The crux of the movie, like it was in the previous Webb outing, is the relationship (however simplified, but unnecessarily projected as overly complicated), between the leads. Everything else is just filler. Denis Leary keeps turning up too, leading me to imagine him glaring at Pete even while they make love (Ugh). Unnecessary, and unintentionally hilarious (the audience I was with as well, kept tittering whenever the Leary vision kept appearing). In spite of this gross oversimplification, watching them interact with one another, and keep throwing high school musical lines at one another, is engaging, and keeps the movie afloat for the duration that Webb deems we spend with them. Not Webb's best work, since the chemistry between Levitt and Deschanel was much better realized in '500..'.<br/><br/>Completely unnecessary - Along with the (Leary) visions, the flashbacks with Campbell Scott and Chris Cooper. The entire background for something Webb edited out of the first movie. The guy in the shadows. Felicity Jones. The kid in the suit. Giamatti/Rhino. (Where was Ratha, btw?) <br/><br/>What we should have got more of - Chris Cooper as ........, Gwen, J Jonah Jameson (still pondering the reason for having this iconic character off-screen in this reboot, esp. since Ratha did not even exist in the comics but they had him in the first one, though they were consistent with the standards they've been setting that they have no explanation for his absence in this one), the action sequences (too few, and too easily resolved - and that's a pity, since the CGI is perhaps some of the best ever committed to screen.....<br/><br/>All in all, a decent summer watch on IMAX 3D, but I somehow think that there are better movies in this summer queue (Edge of tomorrow, Godzilla), and I'll be waiting on those."

","First of all the effects are really good. I like the fact that it's a love story at its core, although the love story ended horribly (still can't get over it. Even though it was expected)<br/><br/>Loooved Peter and Gwen's chemistry. I felt it more compared to the last movie. Finally, we know why Peter's parents left him. There're a lot to love about this movie I just can't put it to words but I'll be talking more about what I hate.<br/><br/>First thing I hate, Electro. Ugh, another die hard superhero fan turned into an enemy bc of some misunderstanding (The Incredibles, Iron Man 3, etc). <br/><br/>Second, Peter and Harry's friendship came out of nowhere. Yes, they were friends before and maybe they hung out for a few weeks during the time span TASM2. But imo they should have showed their closeness more.<br/><br/>As far as I can remember those are the only things I hate about the movie. <br/><br/>Great effects, love story (and chemistry), characters, back stories (i think the back stories opened tons of possible plots for the following movies). But the action parts were a little cliché and overdone while the introduction of the villains were half baked.<br/><br/>As an all around superhero movie it's good (i find great) but as an action movie idk, lol, how ironic. HAHA! <br/><br/>PS I gave it a 9 because of the VFX and how the actors fit their own characters PERFECTLY (if it weren't for the spot on characters i think it'd be a complete mess)."

","My husband, 15 year old daughter and I watched this when my parents came to visit. We all thoroughly disliked this movie. It is very confusing with Jamie Fox playing the villain turned into electrode, and we all felt like he was such a nice guy and loved Spider man, and they didn't really show how he turns into such a hateful villain. Also, the character development of Oscorp founder's son who went to school with Peter Parker and they are great friends but then he turns against Spider Man/Peter Parker without any justification. OK, but the WORST part of the movie (Spoiler Alert!!!) is when Gwen dies during a fight with Electrode and Harry Osborn's son who is now turned into some sort of freak. My daughter went to bed after this and didn't even finish the movie. Also, that was very depressing and why would they do this when Peter Parker has been trying to stay away from her the entire movie to keep her safe and because he feels guilty because of her father's dying wish for him to stay away for safety purposes. We all did not like this movie."

","When Mark Webb first relaunched the Spider-Man franchise, there were many who criticised that it was too soon after Sam Raimi's originals. With Spider-Man 3 spelling the demise of the original trilogy, Webb stepped in to tell a new set of stories of our beloved web slinger. One thing Webbs movies have done so well is to introduce new villains that we haven't seen on screen before, and for me that is what i was most excited to see with this movie!<br/><br/>Amazing Spider-Man 2 picks up some time after the first (the actual time frame isn't really acknowledged)and we see Peter (Garfield) is still loving being Spider-Man. He joins in on Police chases and whilst being his usual wise-cracking self, he still manages to kick ass and save the day. We see that despite Peters promise to her Father in the first movie, he and Gwen (Stone) are back in a relationship. She knows he is Spider-Man and so the movie doesn't waste time with silly plot points about him having to be secretive towards her.(it saves those for Aunt May). There are sub narratives a-plenty, including the introduction of Harry Osborne, as well as Peters on-going search to find out what happened to his Parents.<br/><br/>The Bad Guy/s: We are introduced to Max Dillon aka Electro who is given the usual Supervillian intro. We see that he is an outcast and that no one at Oscorp even knows he exists despite him being a seemingly important designer. Cue massive accident involving electricity and Electro is born. This for me was one of the Highlights of the film. Electro is BADASS!! Not only did they completely nail the look of the character, but the power he has, makes you genuinely question just how Peter will defeat him. Jamie Fox plays him with vulnerability (at first)and then pure anger. It's a great performance for a comic book villain.<br/><br/>The film was not without faults however...a few things that annoyed me slightly were: 1) Rhino was billed to be one of the villains, yet his screen time is less that 5 mins. plus Paul Giamatti's Russian accent is awful! 2) The whole plot around Harry felt very rushed. Maybe some elements could have been saved until the next film. 3) On several occasions Gwen helps Spidey out of bad situations, both physically and intellectually. Peter is supposedly a child genius, now with Superpowers..he didn't need her help!.. it felt like Gwen helping was forced in to give Emma Stone more to do.<br/><br/>All in all it was another great addition to this new franchise. The final showdown on the power grid and in the clock tower are worth the admission price alone, even if the film takes a while to get there. Garfield is great, Fox's Electro is awesome and the movie has many little nods to expanding the Spidey universe (look out for whats behind the glass in the 'Special Projects' wing).<br/><br/>Top notch entertainment."

","The Amazing Spiderman 2 shows the return of Andrew Garfield as Spiderman and his girlfriend Gwen Stacey played by Emma Stone , along with a handful of villains for Spiderman to take on, one of them being Electro played by Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>I went into The Amazing Spiderman 2 with my doubts because from the trailer it looked like they were trying to squeeze as many villains into the movie as possible. The good thing is that they pulled it off quite nicely. The truth about this movie is it focuses on the struggles of Peter Parker more than it does Spiderman, and this is a good thing because it draws you into the movie and makes you give a damn about the characters involved. The Villains are okay with out being great, how ever it is striving for something more than its own movie which i think will have great continuity with the next film in the series. Having said that there is still plenty of action to be witnessed as expected from a Spiderman movie and it looks quite good but are very noticeably heavy on the CGI. <br/><br/>Over all The Amazing Spiderman 2 is striving for something bigger than its own movie and succeeds whilst at the same time having humorous parts as well as being quite dark at some points. <br/><br/>Go see it!"

Garfield's Taunts are as funny as the ones from cartoons provocative and witty, managing to find a sweet spot in my heart.<br/><br/>Emma Stone as lovely as ever, not only steals Peter's heart but also holds our own in her hands with her cuteness and independent personality, her courage and intelligence.<br/><br/>The combat in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is incredible, it feels fluid and natural, and the special effects stamps this experience in our brain, feeling that 2 hours and 22 minutes are not enough for this grandeur masterpiece of Super Heroes and Super Villains!"

","mazing Spiderman 2 spent almost the exact amount of money on its promotion that they spent on its making. Such was never done before for any movie. Expectations were running high until Rottentomatoes gave an average rating to this movie. Why? What went wrong with this movie? NOTHING. This movie is amazingly beautiful. The franchise went to its core; to the heart of Spiderman's original story. Stop judging movies on the scale of Nolan's or Bryan Singer's. Who is Spiderman? Answer: A teenage boy. What do you expect from a teenage boy? To be serious as Batman or want him to feel out of place like Captain America. When you go to the original story of Peter Parker, or to say Avengers, he befriends Tony Stark. They get along because they both are almost same in their heart. Childish. Amazing Spiderman 2 is all Rock and Roll. There is speed, there are great one liners, but the one thing I loved about this movie is the story of Gwen and Parker. In the first three movies Spiderman franchise did horrible mistakes with the storyline. Now, what they are doing is to trace the origin of Spidey before Mary Jane enters his life. They did exceedingly well this time. Watch the first clash between Electro and Spiderman at Times Square. Fighting in between all those billboards and neon signs, the reason of spending such a huge amount on this movie became visibly clear that Sony has its faith on Spiderman as a brand. It will attract people as does the hyperspace of Times Square. The other thing that I liked about this movie is the background score. It is so refreshing and different from all those drum beatings that are going these days in the Superhero movie genre. After The Dark Knight, everyone wants to make one akin to it. This one is so sublimely different. I loved this movie, but I can't bet the same for others. This one is a little different from what we have become accustomed to watch these days in this genre. This one is the best movie of Spiderman made till date. I hope others will enjoy the same as I did."

","I am a huge fan of Spider-man and the first two Spider-man films are one of my favourite films. I was angry when I didn't get a Spider-man 4 but instead got a reboot. While The Amazing Spider-man was decent its main flaw was being a rehash of the first film. But the Amazing Spider-man 2 has the advantage of not being an origin story. This film is truly spectacular. I do not agree with the critics at all about this one. This film continues to tie up 'untold story' TASM was supposed to conclude. Acting by DeDehan, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are top-notch. The Action Scenes and Spidey swinging are Visually Stunning, especially in 3-D. The final action scene was intense and had my heart racing. <br/><br/>Electro and Harry Goblin were creepy villains. Electro seemed like Dr. Manhattan (teleporting and disintegrating) and his motivations were somewhat weak, IMO but I consoled myself that he did what he did because he was crazy. My main problem is with the trailers as they showed the entire Rhino fight scene in the trailers and 70-80% of the Goblin fight scene. <br/><br/>The trailers were badly put as they spoiled many things. If Rhino wasn't in the trailer or poster at all, I would have been surprised and excited about him in the film. Even though his role works fine in the context of the film. While I don't think it's better than the first two Raimi films. Its pretty close. <br/><br/>My rating: 8.5/10"
"pregovarac_m","2","4","13","26 April 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is amazing
","This movie is amazing...every thing that was bad in the first part was good in this one. It is like a totally new film. I do not know how did Marc Web made such a good movie after disasters first part. Movie is very well balanced between action, story, love and drama. Unlike the first part every attempt to make Spider man cool in this part was successful. Action sequences were truly mind blowing. I am so amazed with this movie I truly am, because I was so disappointed after the first part that I had little hope about this movie and I went to cinema to see how bad it would be and I felt so good and glad when it ended. And I can not wait to see third part. What was mostly amazing in this movie was how they made a Spider man a tragic hero in a such fine manner. Almost every thing about this film is good and this is probably one of the best 3D movies I saw."
"bergererikg","8","4","13","25 April 2014"," A Bold Sequel: The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","A Bold Sequel: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 By Erik G. Berger<br/><br/>About five weeks ago I moved to Japan for a one-to-three year contract as a chaplain's assistant and conversational English teacher.<br/><br/>Less than a week ago, I found out the new Spider-Man movie was being released early here. Turns out tonight I got to go see it with a friend, and these are my―spoiler-free―initial thoughts on the movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the character development in this film is quite a relief from the last multi-villain installment of the Spider-Man saga, Sam Raimi's infamous Spider-Man 3. This is, once again, a spoiler-free review so I won't go into detail over the who, what, and when, but suffice it to say that the important characters have adequate backstory screen time and enough ""three- dimensionalness"" to keep the action sequences from seeming forced and unimportant.<br/><br/>Spidey gives a real showstopping performance with his trademark antics, acrobatics and the usual hero-angst, but he does so without ever becoming overbearing. The animation and choreography of the rescues and fight scenes are spectacular, and the new, more classic suit looks really good. The action is reminiscent of the agility and grace of Spider-Man 2's battles with Doctor Octopus and maintains a consistent thread of meaning and (relative) believability throughout.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, in his eternal search for the balance between being a hero, and being a human, bleeds emotion and quirky humor like the fun yet deeply relatable character that he's become so well known to be. The dialogue scenes with him and Gwen are some of my favorite moments. Beautiful chemistry between the two of them.<br/><br/>As one can tell from the catchphrase on the movie posters for The Amazing Spider-Man 2, our web-slinging hero does face quite the battle: on emotional, physical, and superhuman levels. Jaimie Foxx plays a great new take on Electro, and proves to be a more satisfying villain―in my opinion―than the Lizard from the previous Amazing Spider-Man movie. Also Harry Osborn as a foil, and Gwen as his damsel-in-and-of-distress each prove to be engaging points of personal conflict in their own way.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the film quite a bit. As a mild critique: I would say the score, though very succinct and cool, felt overdone in more than one scene. The overuse of music gave the whole film a slightly theatrical feel, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on how you look at it. The rest of my critical comments will have to wait for a ""with spoilers"" review.<br/><br/>Again though, I laughed, gasped, and had my hands grabbing the armrests of my chair multiple times throughout the well-filled 142 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>Towards the end there is some indication of what might be featured in the next film, and I'm very much on the edge of my seat to find out exactly what that will look like!<br/><br/>That's it for my ""night of,"" first impressions on the new Spidey movie, true believers. It was amazing.<br/><br/>'Nuff said.<br/><br/>―Erik"
"Seraphion","7","4","13","21 April 2014"," Nice touch with the story development
","The story start by delving deeper on Peter's parent's death, then focus on the events from the first movie with Spidey and the police chief. Peter can't handle the dilemma so Gwen breaks up with him. As always there's controversy among New Yorkers about Spidey fighting crime. Trying to move on past Gwen, Peter gets reminiscent of his late parents. The focus then starts alternating shifts to persons like Max Dillon, who was briefly saved by Spidey, his complex insecurities, and his ultimate transformation into Electro. The focus also shifts to Harry Osbourne who inherits Oscorp after Norman Osbourne dies.<br/><br/>Spidey then meets the psychologically unstable and transformed Max Dillon. A battle ensue between them because Max take it too personally when Spidey fails to remember his name. Peter researched about his parents while fixing his web-shooter that breaks in the fight against Electro. Not long after, Harry find out about the project that will be Green Goblin's gear, and a conclusion that Spidey's blood can cure him from his genetic illness. He calls Peter to see him in Oscorp Tower. Meanwhile, Gwen escapes capture after she is to be arrested by internal Oscorp security for searching information on Max Dillon.<br/><br/>Spidey then sees Harry to explain to him that it's dangerous to give Harry his blood but Harry can't take it. Aunt May tells Peter a thing that she kept from him about his father and Peter is confused over it. But he soon finds a keyword and heads to the place referred, Meanwhile the traitor inside Oscorp manages to fire Harry off his position. Harry then gets revenge by freeing Electro and forcing the Oscorp brass to give him the spider venom which is supposedly the alternative for Spiderman's blood. His body doesn't react well with venom and he gets into Green Goblin armor to support the self-healing effort better.<br/><br/>Electro draws Spidey out by plunging the city into blackout. Spidey goes on to face him, telling Gwen to stay behind. Gwen disobeys and helps Spidey to reset the power grids. After that Green Goblin comes, revealing that he has discovered Peter's Spiderman identity and feels disappointed on the Spidey's blood issue. Another battle then ensue, in which Goblin is defeated. Harry the plots to gather men for what's to be known as Sinister Six.<br/><br/>As all previous Spidey movies, drawing straight from his characteristics in the comics, this movie is full of small laughs and on-liner remarks. The story builds well to considerable depths. No scene is wasted as almost all consistently contain significant weight, either to character development, story build-up, or to include snippets of cross-reference to the comics.<br/><br/>The acting is good overall. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone still retain their class, and even the lit up Jamie Foxx portrays the bad guy well enough. Dane DeHaan did a good job also, although I think that the screenplay isn't being developed well on the final battle scene that it feels like his acting is a little lame there.<br/><br/>For me the action is quite a so-so, considering that most are done through CGI. What I was surprised to see is that the materials that were published for marketing purposes such as on featurettes, clips and even trailers have elements of the ending, something that is rarely done nowadays. <br/><br/>The first movie doesn't really give obvious hint for a trilogy setting. But here the leads are more than crystal clear. And there's also room that is left vacant in the romance department for the next installment. From the way the story develops, it makes me curious about the next installment. Is it going to be a trilogy, meaning that it's likely to be an epic scale battle, or will there be more than a trilogy, meaning that the story will be developed into a more detailed presentation.<br/><br/>Finally, overall from me The Amazing Spiderman 2 gets a 7 out of 10 score from me and a recommendation to go and see it."
"Tibs123","7","4","13","18 April 2014"," Entertaining but not amazing
","My biggest gripe of the first film was that it felt too much as a rehash of the original Raimi spiderman film so I assumed the second one would be much better because it had the chance to form it's own story and universe, instead of closely following the storyline of previous films. And yes it was better than the first film but was it "" amazing""? No, not yet.<br/><br/>The biggest fear I had was that it would had too many villains and story lines and I was partly right ( however it was not as bad as I thought it would be). Sony just wants to build its universe as quick as possible and set up as many story lines as possible but it's going too fast in my opinion. To build an natural superhero universe it takes time and effort. Don't try to cram too much into one film.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film are the performances of the leads. I adore the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Stone shines as Gwen Stacy and she is one of my favourite parts of the new films. Jamie Foxx and Dane Dehaan were also great in their roles. Giamatti was a bit too much over the top but he was fun too watch.<br/><br/>The pace and tone felt a bit uneven. At times was the film even a bit corny ( but I guess that's the tone of the comics so I can live with that). The film was a bit too long and I would have like to seen more Electro ( his powers were awesome) and to take a little more time to develop the story of the green goblin ( perhaps span it over a couple of films). I personally would have cut Goblin out of the film ( not Osborn, just his transformation), added more Electro and cut a few scenes.<br/><br/>( Another note I would like to make is the weird use of the music: the music was really well done and sometimes even creepy,like during the appearances of Electro. Almost every time there was some dubstep along with Electro so that was really weird but it had an epic feel. Oh yeah , the music during the end credits didn't fit with the tone of the film)<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"jaemiewaters","10","5","18","4 May 2014"," Best marvel movie since the Avengers

","I seen this movie. They showed it to me on one of them big TVs you gotta pay money to see. There were a lot of white people in the movie and they all lived in a fancy city. Sometimes the white people shout because things happen to them that makes them angry. I heard robot-computers used numbers to show me amazing special effects, what wonders the future has to offer! One thing I don't understand about this movie is why did all that stuff happen. Maybe they will make more spider people movies to explain. Also am I supposed to feel sad when the nice lady dies?

"justbob1982","6","3","9","16 December 2014"," Passable, but still not up to Raimi standard
","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)<br/><br/>Actors: 6/10<br/><br/>Plot/script: 5/10<br/><br/>Photography/visual style: 6/10<br/><br/>Music/score: 6/10<br/><br/>Overall: 6/10<br/><br/>If the producers of this film thought everyone would have forgotten the Raimi versions by now, they were dead wrong. The reasons for these films are well-documented: contractual stipulations mean Sony lose the rights to the character if they don't make films on a semi-regular basis. The commercial machinations are quite interesting, in a way, but not very artistically credible.<br/><br/>To be fair, in some areas, this version stands up quite well. Andrew Garfield makes a good Spidey, balancing the nerdy weakling and wisecracking hero sides of the character. This has especially pleased some people who never liked Tobey Maguire's portrayal, although I think he was at least as good. The rapport with co-star Emma Stone is good as well; whether this is just good acting or a sign of their reported off-screen romance I do not know, and to be honest don't much care, although I understand that it makes a great bit of PR. Too bad that... well, you'll see.<br/><br/>Out of the two villains, Dane DeHaan has even more of a balance to strike as the schizophrenic Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, and manages it with more aplomb than James Franco did, in my opinion. It's just a shame that James Foxx is given so little to do as Electro. He is a very good actor, and doesn't deserve to be CGIed almost out of existence and given an emotional register that ranges from angry to very angry.<br/><br/>The plot holes have been commented on by others, but I think they overstate the matter. Yes, there are plot holes, and contrivances, and none of the good stuff is quite enough to forgive this, but many of the criticisms don't hang together for me.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between old Spidey and new, and the one that is most difficult to surmount, is the director. Marc Webb seems capable enough, but he just doesn't have that touch of flair that Sam Raimi could add at times. Without that, the new films will never be more than passable.<br/><br/>For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogger, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk"
"chrisduggan92","4","3","9","11 December 2014"," Really disappointing
","Was actually quite looking forward to seeing this movie as I quite enjoyed The Amazing Spider-Man and thought Mark Webb might be able to get the franchise moving in the right direction again. With its predecessor butchered by Spider-Man 3, I fear the same thing has happened again with this movie.<br/><br/>I found myself wanting to look away at times because I found the Peter/Gwen relationship so drawn out and painful to watch. The sideshow villains are comical with none of the comedy. The main villains on the other hand, are extremely underdeveloped, which is surprising given the length of the film, and just plain irritating at times. Spider-Man's jokes are cringe-worthy and predictable, much like the rest of the film and the soundtrack went down the cliché route as well.There is also not as many action scenes as one would expect in 142 minutes.<br/><br/>With other franchises like X-Men (the last stand aside) and the marvel cinematic universe films consistently churning out solid movies, the bar is set so high for super-hero movies nowadays and this is nowhere near it.<br/><br/>At the time of writing this has an IMDb rating of 7/10 which I can scarcely believe. The only reason I have given it 4/10 and not lower is because there is actually some quite cool visuals in it and I have seen worse films than this recently. But I will certainly not be watching it again any time soon."

Though the electro was very good the only person and character I liked in movie and what about the direction of spider? <br/><br/>What is happened to this one the films which were made by Sam ramie were the great movies of spider but the reboot of the franchise doesn't means that it will be more good as compared to the first one.<br/><br/>Terribly, I have to say that this franchise has a lot to do specially on story line <br/><br/>The things which I had liked in the movie were Electro, Action scenes<br/><br/>And also the other two villains also doesn't makes sense in the movie the one was enough I think the franchise is at its best in its CGI and VFX but it needs to be work on story line as well as the direction in the movie"
"tomgillespie2002","4","3","9","25 August 2014"," Sporadically fun but mainly just a bore
","If Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man trilogy (2002-2007) had never existed, Marc Webb's arguably unnecessary reboot The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) would have been a near-perfect introduction to the cocky web- slinger. Andrew Garfield, one the most intriguing young actors around, and Emma Stone, that old-school sassy and husky-voiced beauty who effortlessly charmed in Easy A (2010), were an almost dream couple, and their romantic scenes sparkled with chemistry. But when Garfield put on his costume and went spinning webs across the city, the film owed everything to Raimi's eye for crazy, energetic camera-work, and failed to thrill enough as a re-imagining in it's own right. Raimi's influence seemed unshakeable.<br/><br/>Yet the film was a success, and two years later we have a sequel. The story moves on and Peter Parker (Garfield) has grown too, though he is still caught up in a reluctant relationship with Gwen Stacy (Stone), having been warned by her dying father at the end of the last movie to leave her out of his superhero business. After apprehending a criminal named Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) who was trying to run away with some plutonium vials, he saves nervous young Oscorp worker Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), who becomes infatuated with Spider-Man, believing them to have a special friendship. Parker's old friend and Oscorp inheritor Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) is also back in town, and learns that his dying father's illness is hereditary.<br/><br/>With the first having shared so much with the original trilogy, it's surprising that Webb and the writers have made the same mistakes as the one that killed Raimi's baby in it's tracks. Thankfully, there's no emo Peter Parker dance scene, but there is an over-abundance of villains. Okay, Giamatti's Rhino barely registers (thankfully), but Jamie Foxx's Electro and DeHaan's emerging Green Goblin battle for screen time, and DeHaan is far too exciting an actor to feel like he's being squeezed in. Having watched Marvel's Avengers dominate the box-office, Sony are clearly starting to set-up something bigger, but they do so at the expense of the film at hand.<br/><br/>In fact, there's an over-abundance of everything. With a hefty running time of 140 minutes, the amount going on in the film should justify it's length. But Parker spends most of his time being angry at his parents for being dead, similar to the angst done better last time around, and his plucky conversations with on-off girlfriend Gwen soon loose their charm and quickly become annoying. The action scenes, although they look beautiful in hi-definition as Electro causes havoc, suffer from seen-it- all-before syndrome, and some of the dialogue spouted by Giamatti especially, caused me to worry that Joel Schumacher had perched his a**e back on the director's chair. It's sporadically fun but mainly just a bore, but I fully expect a third instalment to turn up in two year's time.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.co.uk"
"arsimgaruna","6","3","9","17 August 2014"," Comedy of Errors!
","Synopsis: The Amazing Spiderman Peter Parker runs a crusade against foes like Electro and Green Goblin whom he sends packing before the end of the movie in his distinctive style.<br/><br/>Review: The Spiderman Series has been one of the greatest hits in the history of 'Hollywood'. Unfortunately, in contrast 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' turned out to be the lowest earning entry in the franchise. To put in a few straight words, the movie was drab and dragged across its span of 142 minutes unlike the previous stints. The movie starts with an incident in the distant past of Peter Parker, explaining the circumstances of their missing in Peter's childhood. The movie then takes a leap into the current life of Peter Parker, a man in his 20s.This jump can surely be uncomfortable for those viewers those who have not watched the prequel of the sequence. This movie tried to impart sense of humor by gimmicks like 'Spiderman ring-tone in serious situations', which disturbed the action and didn't fell in well with the audience, at least me. It looked cheap and undesirable. The movie has logical lapses at some places that decreases interest in the movie. Peter's first meeting with Max(one of villains known as Electro) is one such instance. The movie tries to bring in romantic elements but they die out before climax or conclusion. Intense action scenes are also lacking in the movie, unlike the previous versions. Thus the movie fails to quality either as ""action"", ""romance"" or ""thriller"" or ""tragedy"". During the later half the movie becomes predictable and there is nothing much left for the audience to speculate. The movie also has some positive points. It is a good watch for those who are those who are ""die-hard"" spider-man fans. The Cinematography in the movie is awesome with some breath-taking shots. It could have been another blockbuster, had the story been more absorbing and realistic."

","To write about this movie, lets start from the beginning. When spiderman came i was stunned with the effects and direction storyline, but with spiderman 2 i was just ""ok"" then the action sequence of spiderman3 and acting directing blew me away.<br/><br/>i was not expecting much from Amazing spiderman but it touched me. its humor, the character amused me and action was superb but what they did with this new franchise was the same as they did with spiderman 2.The Amazing Spiderman 2's Special effects were awesome, acting was superb but the storyline was not up to the mark. the story felt random. It didn't connect the audience. Electro's powers were awesome but his character was not, a personal vendetta against spiderman without solid reason and the Green Goblin was just for name sake.The hero is only great as his villains and i m not impressed by its villains and storyline. But it sure is worth the watch for its catchy action and special effects, humor and acting. I give this movie a 7/10."
"andrewmontano297","7","3","9","22 May 2014"," This movie had so much potential
","The amazing spiderman did not live up to the standards it should have. This trilogy has so much to give, and that all could have been flushed down the toilet.<br/><br/>The major issue with this movie is too many plots. Each scenario feels rushed and therefore leaves you feeling, ""umm, which story is exactly the main story here?"" We'll it should've been electro, as the title would suggest. But Harry's story as well as peters two conflicting dilemmas of his love life and struggle to find out why his parents abandoned him push electro into becoming nothing more than a supporting character. I feel Harry was more of the prime villain due to his use of electro to further his goals. I believe if the movie focused solely on electro, and perhaps used this movie to strengthen the friendship of Harry and peter as well as the decline of it. Perhaps if the film ended with Harry questioning there friendship in some way that would lead to his villainy in the next movie, not this one. Therefore electro could be the main baddie of the film. Also electros development could've been a lot deeper. The rhino was useless and a waste, easily the most irritating in the film. You may ask wasn't Gwen's death the most irritating? We'll no because that was just an attempt to stay true to the comics. The reason I gave this film a 7 is because you saw the potential it had despite the flaws, besides it was fairly entertaining and not boring. Captain America was easily the best summer experience, but out of all the disappointments that have been spawning, the amazing spiderman comes second and is definitely not a forgettable experience. The actors have promise, so hopefully the writers and director will learn from this and build upon it , this series can still make a comeback, all hope is not lost yet. If these guys want to beat the Toby maguire series they need to do better, by the way I like the new twist on the green goblin but dane looks like a teenage high schooler, he can never be as badass as the original green goblin from the 2000s series."
"classicsoncall","8","3","9","10 May 2014"," ""Hey, I think I know that guy!""
","I knew there was a reason for all those TV commercials for the U.S. Post Office featuring Spider-Man and Stan Lee; Spidey goes absolutely postal in this Andrew Garfield sequel. The action is high flying and if it weren't over the top, I think fans wouldn't be as impressed. Not having followed Spidey very much in the comics however, I didn't quite get the idea that he was somehow invulnerable like Superman considering the pasting he took from Electro (Jamie Foxx) and Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan). I'm aware of the proportional spider strength so to speak, but seeing Spider-Man crash into buildings and pavement the way he did made it a wonder he kept coming back for more.<br/><br/>Peter Parker fans also get their fill here with the angst in his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Garfield displays a whole lot more emotion in this follow up to ASM1, but hey, there were a whole bunch of college football players crying this week during the NFL draft picks so it goes with the times. Half way through the movie my mind wandered back to the comic book story of Gwen Stacy's death, so I began to wonder if that's what would happen here. The finale will absolutely crush anyone who's not expecting it.<br/><br/>As usual, it was great to see Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee (along with Steve Ditko) cameo once again in a Marvel flick. He was present at the high school graduation early in the picture, and is the guy who says ""That's amaaaaazing"" in the commercial."

The fist half of the movie though it lacked the flow it was quite awesome but the second half ( just after the main actress dies) the movie could have been quite average but the story after that just spoiled everything as it looked as if the ending parts have been copied and pasted from another movie. <br/><br/>The last 15 minutes or so made the movie just like any other ordinary movie in-spite of all the action and everything.<br/><br/>I don't know whether after making the movie the director viewed it or not or even bothered to show it to someone and forgot to ask their opinion.The last 15 minutes certainly spoiled the story-line of the entire movie and probably ruined the goodness and awesomeness of the entire spiderman series."
"griffolyon12","7","3","9","1 May 2014"," Just an Okay Spider-Man Movie
","In the follow up to 2012's reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man, we find Spider-Man on a journey to further figure out the mystery surrounding his parents' death, all the while going toe-to- toe with the new big bad guy in town, known as Electro. <br/><br/>I'm gonna get straight to the point, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not as good as the other Spider-Man films, but it is a piece of popcorn entertainment that will entertain for most of it's two plus hour run time. However, as a fan, I cannot lie and say that I am not disappointed by this film, and as an amateur film critic, I have to be honest and point out how cluttered the film often feels. <br/><br/>In all honesty, they just tried to pack too much into this one movie to try and set up future films and spin-offs, like Venom and The Sinister Six. There is not a clear focus to this film, unlike any of the other Spider-Man films. It's unclear as to what the filmmakers were actually trying to do here. Is it the story of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy? Is it the story of how Spidey met Electro? Or is it the story of the Green Goblin? It's all of those things and a whole lot more, but there is never enough time devoted to any one of those story threads for them to feel fully fleshed out and satisfying on their own. I really think the culprit for all of this is in the Spidey producers trying to be like Marvel Studios and The Avengers. <br/><br/>No longer can a superhero movie be simply a good standalone movie, and if that one is successful, they make another one with a similar, single-minded focus. Now, in the wake of the massive amount of cash The Avengers brought in, every superhero film franchise has to create this larger than life canvas of multiple films intersecting to create a larger story. While I love The Avengers, here's one of the things that Marvel Studios has done for almost all of their films, which The Amazing Spider-Man 2 did not do. They made every one of their superhero films good standalone films on their own right, and not just films that had to be seen in the larger context to be liked or understood. I mean, look at both of the Captain America movies. Take those away from the context of The Avengers, and they're phenomenal films irregardless, but add in the ingredient that is The Avengers, and you get super awesomeness. The thing is, the key is making one good film, and not placing so much focus on the future that you forget about the present. Of course, what really makes me feel conflicted here is that there are just a good many things that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 does right.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is once again phenomenal as Spider-Man, and Emma Stone is even more lovable as Gwen Stacy (as if that was possible). The film truly shines in the romantic scenes between Stone and Garfield, particularly because those are the scenes, alongside the music montages, where it feels like director Marc Webb is most comfortable. There are moments where I see that spark from his music video work and (500) Days of Summer, and in the midst of all the spectacle and bombastic action, it is those moments that stuck with me more than anything else. Somewhere in the midst of all of the excess that this film has, there is a very innocent and true romance, and I think that is the real focus of this film, but it's often pushed aside for too long to develop something that may not pay off for another film or two. As a matter of fact, if the film was purely about Peter and Gwen's romantic woes and Electro, I'd have been a happier Spider-Man fan, because I really like what actor Jamie Foxx and the filmmakers did with Electro, alas he gets the shaft after about the first hour mark. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm becoming a bit of a movie curmudgeon, but the more and more I analyze films, the more I realize, the simpler you often make the story, the better the film. While that may not always be the case, I think here, it is. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is just too bloated, feeling like three different films crammed into the run time of just one. While it is a film that you will have fun at, laugh at, and actually feel something at, it is not a great film, it's simply okay. I actually remember reading another review the other day where they said, had this film been made in the Nineties, it would be one of the best superhero movies ever made, but made now, when we have so many other top notch superhero films, many of which being other Spider-Man movies, it just pales in comparison. Even still, if you can accept that this is not the greatest Spider-Man film, you will enjoy yourself with The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which I did for at least three-fourths of this film, I just wish it had all tied together a little better.<br/><br/>I give The Amazing Spider-Man 2 a 7 out of 10!"

","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is definitely a movie you should watch! Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's relationship was outstanding! Dane Dahan brings his magic back on screen and was a very important part of the film. The film could have done without the first 30 minutes or so, they were just random events that did not seem right at the time. Other than that, the movie has everything you want from a spiderman film, the soundtrack was great, peter parkers portrayal (without the suit) was amazing to watch too. The way you see spiderman swinging between buildings will definitely get a smile on your face! :D Even though I couldn't connect to max Dillon all that much, the overall portrayal of electro on the big screen was done great! Every tiny detail about spidey is explored in this film and its a great watch! The future of the Spiderman films is bright and this has to be the best spiderman movie yet!"
"aldri-feb","7","3","9","30 April 2014"," Not so amazing but still entertaining
","While the studio was too busy to create spectacular action sequences, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" struggles with nonstructural plot, comical script and weak character development. The movie is overstuffed with unnecessary material and some coincidences moment that would make audiences feel exhausted also appearing many new characters affected this second installment into unfocused at storyline. Marc Webb as director seems confused to gather the two main villain and failed to introduce them properly. Surprisingly, the positive side of the movie comes from Peter Parker-Gwen Stacy's love story. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone successfully to portrait two teenagers who are madly in love and their chemistry put this movie into a different level of superhero franchise though it sometimes feels more like soap opera. Overall despite poor executed at storyline, ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" is undeniably romantic and still entertaining as summer blockbuster movie, also an unbelievable performance from Andrew Garfield has stolen sympathy that is needed and promisingly opens a gate to the next chapter of Spider-Man."
"akashvj96","6","3","9","29 April 2014"," Entertaining but certainly not ""Amazing"".
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 faces almost the same problems that it's predecessor faced. The screenplay is weak and the story line lacks a definite structure and regular consistency. The overlong story is clichéd, crowded with villains and contains some unnecessary subplots forced into it. The background soundtrack certainly did not help.<br/><br/>But regardless of it's flaws it does have a few positives. The visual effects are impressive and the performances by Andrew Garfield and Jamie Foxx are great. But that's really all.<br/><br/>It doesn't really surpass it's predecessor and considering the recent achievements of the superhero genre in recent years, The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a huge step back. It's not more than just a popcorn flick. It disappointingly fails more than it succeeds."
"windlepaul","1","5","19","10 November 2016"," the worst marvel movie ever
","I wasn't to excited for this movie as the first amazing spider-man wasn't all that bad, it was a decent and enjoyable flick. Firstly let's make something clear this isn't a superhero movie seriously it isn't I know it's called the amazing spider-man 2 but it's more of a romantic movie between spider-man (Peter Parker) and Gwen Stacey. It barely has any fight scenes at all. Electro was a complete waste in this movie as his CGI body is horrible. Harry Osborn has changed so much since the last movie and his the goblin character is never seen until the last act of the movie. I don't know what they were trying to do with Gwen's death, trying to make it emotional or boring whatever they were trying to do it was dull. There is only one word to describe this movie and that is terrible."
"Troy_Campbell","7","5","19","18 April 2014"," Bigger, louder, longer. Better?
","After copping criticism for having a weak villain in the first movie, this sequel offers up three baddies to make Spidey's life hell and in the process sums up exactly what this follow up is aiming for: more, more and more. The teen angst is amped up to 11, the romantic pulling and pushing is nonstop and the threats against downtown Manhattan have tripled. Often when bigger and/or louder is the major goal of a movie it doesn't work out so great (see Transformers 2), yet returning director Marc Webb (no joke) handles the increased excess relatively well. The CGI-laden set pieces are, umm, electric and the fights are choreographed with panache, however the screenplay doesn't hold up quite as well. Straining under the influence of four different scribes and a rushed deadline, the plot is tonally muddled and chocked with clichés whilst the dialogue is not as witty and, with the banter between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey especially, less authentic. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's sparky chemistry remains and Dane DeHaan and Jamie Foxx bring their A-game as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin and Max Dillon/Electro respectively, but Paul Giamatti, Felicity Jones and Chris Cooper are all criminally underused. There's a hugely impactful and ballsy plot turn near the end, which would've been a fantastic note to finish on, however its effect is diminished with a bizarre coda that serves no purpose other than to set up the series' next part. Too long and with flaws aplenty, Rise of Electro is nevertheless exciting and humorous in it's own bombastic kind of way."

","this is my first review. I'm a big fan of spider man. even thought i don't like reboot of this amazing spider man version anyway i convinced myself & excepted a lot by seeing the action packed trailer. but after watching the movie it has become a poor story with stupid actions. whats wrong with villains they showed very strong at first and as usually some idea sparked into spider head and immediately they are defeated. this is normally showed in previous part also. so give a change to the spider man. and finally the death of gwen is totally a s**t one if the super hero is not able to save his own girl then how can he save up the people? don't waste Ur bucks by going to theater just wait for the Net version."
"MattBirk","5","2","5","17 March 2016"," Not Terrible but not that good...
","Though I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me, but I find this sequel to be slightly superior to the first, mostly because the love story between Peter and Gwen and a standout villain, Electro. The character development was rich, the action was far better, and the movie 'somewhat' moves away from the horribly overdone origin storyline. The movie gives us more insight into his internal struggle between finding his path as a person and his responsibility as a superhero. That is where the phenomenal chemistry between Stone and Garfield comes into play, they are so believable it's incredible (just might be the best love story in the comic book film genre). <br/><br/>But Amazing 2 does have plenty of faults, most notably it focuses a ton of time on Harry Osborn and in the final climax of the film we get to see him shine......for like 10 minutes (what a waste). All that build up and no payoff.<br/><br/>The movie also carries over the dreaded parent plot line just like the original 3 Sam Raimi films which have completely been beaten dry. I don't understand why they keep attaching this sub-storyline to each film, they want it to be more important than it should be. The only redeeming quality of the film has the be Jamie Foxx's Electro, a standout villain who sadly is not given enough screen time.<br/><br/>There are far better comic book movies out there!"

"cherold","4","2","5","12 November 2015"," A big drop in quality over the last movie
","I really enjoyed the 2012 Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot that was far more satisfying than the Spider-Man right before it. So in spite of hearing negative things, I had to watch this.<br/><br/>The first scene in it, which doesn't have Spidey in it, is pretty decent, with a bit of mystery and an exciting take on uploading a file. <br/><br/>Alas, the movie lost me as Spider-Man appeared. First off - and I know this isn't an easy task - the special effects looked unconvincing. Spider-Man's movements were too fluid, as though he were fully animated (which he probably was).<br/><br/>The movie starts with a chase scene, with a wise-cracking Spidey taunting the bad guys and rescuing a bunch of people. It was just okay, and there was a bit on Spidey trying to corral some dangerous test-tubes that was too close to slapstick.<br/><br/>I watched almost an hour of the movie, and while that included a couple of action scenes, some banter, a character introduction, and the oddly serious, Montgomery Clift style Peter Parker, none of it caught my interest.<br/><br/>In fact, the only really good scene was Peter and his girlfriend flirting and making rules for each other. It was a nice little scene that suggested the producers should have just cast the principals in a little romantic comedy. <br/><br/>When the best thing about a big action movie is the love interest, it's not a good action movie. So I gave up on it."

","The directors of this movie didn't read any Spiderman comics or they are just dumb asses and selfish corporate pricks that want your money since your child and all marvel fans wants to see the Spiderman movie.<br/><br/>The characters you loved form the last reboot are so much worse in this movie, Peter Parker is just Gewn's puppy, he will do anything for her, even put others at risk if it means to save her. The Osbornes are just boring and you won't care about them until the end, Gwen Stacy is only a Damsel and doesn't give any sort of fun or entertainment to the plot.<br/><br/>The plot. It has so many holes, characters randomly meet in elevators or in the street to provide the next objective of the characters.<br/><br/>The villain is awful, Jamie Fox tried but he isn't the man for this movie, Eletro's powers are OP and not at all based on the original one from the comic books.<br/><br/>The dialogue is annoying, predictable and a lot of times stupid. Andrew Garfield proved once again that he can only play one kind of Spiderman, he is starting to be the Kristen Stewart of this franchise.<br/><br/>In the movie you will get some references for future movies, but that will drive anyone insane because of how bad this one is.<br/><br/>There is almost no action in this marvel movie and the battles are forgettable. One fight doesn't even end and the movie gives a big ""Thank you for the money now go home"" to the audience.<br/><br/>This could have been the movie that made a new and awesome Spiderman with good one liners for cool characters, but they are horrible in every way. Your head will explode because of the big amount of ""WTF just happened"" moments in the movie.<br/><br/>A solid 5/10 for The amazing Spiderman 2, it could have been a Captain America 2 but it ended being more like a Fantastic four fail, kind of movie."
"bh_tafe3","6","2","5","14 March 2015"," A vast improvement on the original, but can't save the franchise
","You can relax, there's nothing in this one as bad as the ""hero"" allowing a store to be robbed because he can't afford a milkshake, but there's nothing in this to completely redeem the mess of a first film either.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield returns as Peter Parker and this time he is acting a little more responsibly as Gwen's late father (Denis Leary) comes to him in a vision to remind him of his promise to ""keep Gwen out of this"" and he breaks up with her. Better late than never. Next we see Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborne come back to town to see his terminally ill father Norman (a completely wasted Chris Cooper) and.... oh holy jeepers, I just can't do it! I'm sorry, why am I watching this same story again? Can you guess which villain Hary Osborne turns out to be? Argghhhhh.<br/><br/>OK next up on the villain list we have Jamie Foxx, who must have been watching Batman Forever (or maybe one of the four writers who spat this out by committee had) as he plays Edward Nigma, I mean max Dillon. A nerd, but he gets super powers and instead of turning into the Riddler, he turns into Electro, a wasted villain.<br/><br/>Let's see what else happens...well, let's face it, you don't care and neither does anyone else on the committee that vomited this out. And just to try and convince you something meaningful has happened in this and that it's actually following the comic, they kill off Gwen at the end. But far from being a moment of genuine emotion, it's just another tacked on, ineffectual contrivance to try and convince you that you are actually invested in this. Far from honouring the comics, this is a moment that simply follows it for convenience. And it ends back at the beginning with Spiderman trying to stop a rampaging Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>The main things to appreciate here are on the technical side. Webb has done a good job of capturing spider sense, and effectively uses more established filming techniques to create a sense of frenetic action. The set pieces are all breathtaking and the big battles deliver on the effects side of things. It's the action sequences that really elevate this above the by the numbers production that it almost is. So I tip my hat to Mark Webb, but unfortunately, to paraphrase the Dark Knight, he's the director this film needs, but not the one it deserves.<br/><br/>The other positive are our two leads, Stone is a superior love interest to MJ in the originals and a superior character as well who serves a function beyond being a damsel in distress. Andrew Garfield is great as Parker and arguably delivers the best characterization of Parker seen on the big screen. However, like Timothy Dalton as James Bond, he's the right actor at the wrong time, and not even his performance can elevate the character or the film above the mediocrity he is given to work with.<br/><br/>To finish off, the story in this film is a mess. A well made, well acted mess, but ultimately a mess all the same. It's not a bad thing that this one underperformed and Sony have again decided to reboot the franchise. Hopefully a bit more thought can revitalize this series that money grabbing laziness has greatly diminished over the past two films and the director's ego diminished in the third."
"vinzontop64","10","2","5","16 December 2014"," Great Movie
","This movie is the best spider-man movie along with the first one. I love how the brought Spider man's acrobatic skills and web swinging. I also love how the writers are bringing out more villains in the movie. Another thing would be the costume, I love that the writers decided to stick with the old fashion spider-man and the lenses are big how it should be. It's like they ripped the costume out of the comics. Also, it focuses on the struggles that Peter is going through as Spider-man, and his friendship with Harry Osborn. It's a great obstacle for Peter if he can protect those he cares about or get them hurt. Therefore, I believe it's a great movie, the writers did covered everything how Spider-man should be."

","I have to ask, why is there so much hate on this movie? Maybe that people are use to Tobey Mcguire as Peter Parker, but to me, Andrew Garfield is the Spider-Man. Even though Gwen Stacey died(Soilers, well comics)she is still more interesting than Mary-Jane Watson(Not to mention that Gwen Stacey isn't as much of a damsel in distress like what Mary was). But the villains in this movie aren't that interesting(apart from Electro, played by Jamie Foxx), Doc Oc was more interesting and more iconic. The action scenes in this movie are the best parts, thanks to the slow-motion in parts of the movie(especially with Electro). Oh and there WILL be 2 more sequels along the way and I'm wondering ""who will portray Mary-Jane Watson?"
"steph_duff","9","2","5","24 October 2014"," Brilliant expansion of the franchise
","Amazing Spiderman 2 is a brilliant superhero film. Whilst I was sceptical about the first re-boot of this franchise – so soon after Toby Macguire played Peter Parker – Garfield stamps his own interpretation on the role and delivers an incredibly mature performance in his second-outing.<br/><br/>The action sequences are breath-taking – free falling to the ground from on top of a skyscraper, electric energy pulsating round Time Square, the Green Goblin being born. There are so many plot twists, which send shivers down the spine and leave me desperate to see more. I particularly like how, compared to the Toby Macguire films, they seem to be introducing a host of villains, all kitted out with special technology from Oscorp's ""Top Secret"" R&D vault.<br/><br/>Another excellent feature is the numerous touching moments in the film, which work well alongside the action. Best of all, we see a little boy – dressed in a Spidey outfit – runs out in front of the latest gun-toting baddie, who has pinned down the city's police force, showing the same qualities of inspirational bravery that make this superhero so exciting to watch. This is typical of the brilliant artistic touches this film demonstrates. Another highlight is Stacey Gwen's graduation speech encouraging her peers: ""don't waste it living someone else's life, make yours count for something. Fight for what matters to you, no matter what. Because even if you fall short, what better way is there to live?"""
"CMTiago","7","2","5","5 October 2014"," Not so amazing, but not terrible Spider-Man movie
","Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed all the Spider-Man movies released so far, some more than others, and while they are different in various aspects, I think they all provide enough quality entertainment for those less demanding. In this second installment of the rebooted series, we get yet another authentic Peter Parker/Spider-Man performance from Andrew Garfield, who seems to have fitted in well to this iconic role, and a plot that while it does present some inconsistency, manages to at least keep itself going with great action and good character development in some cases.<br/><br/>So the movie follows Peter Parker loving his life as the hero of New York City: Spider-Man. We immediately get to see him going at it, being cocky and jokey, but also knowing when it's time to stop the bad guy. Throughout the film Peter will have to fight with his inner conscience, as he ponders if he should stay with his love, Gwen Stacy, or respect her father's wishes to keep her out of danger. As Spider-Man, he will also have to deal with Electro, formerly known as Max Dillon, an lonely Oscorp worker who becomes obsessed with Spider-Man. Upon having an accident at his work place, he turns into Electro and will begin to hold a grudge over Spidey, after he sees things in a different perspective. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the Harry Osborn subplot, which in the long term, seems to lead into the Sinister Six storyline that Sony is trying to put together.<br/><br/>All parts of the movie have their ups and downs, but mostly combine to make for an enjoyable experience. Peter & Gwen's relationship troubles are at times front and center and the chemistry from Garfield and Stone (real life partners) really helps the movie's flow. I think that some comic book fanatics just need to appreciate the emotional aspect of this connection in the movie. Electro was at times very misused. but the good effort by Jamie Foxx makes him an acceptable villain for the movie. As far as Oscorp and Peter's dad's past, all the components are well put together, even if it does depend on coincidental actions. Dane DeHaan's Osborn is in my opinion well portrayed, and I for one can understand why he comes off as whiny, after all I did appreciate his back story.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 delivered some aspects well, mainly the action. Yet much like Iron Man 3, it felt like the potential was fully stretched, which is a shame, since it could have made the movie live to it's title, and be amazing, which is something the first one wasn't, despite being better than its successor. I really hope they can give us a terrific third movie. Fingers crossed <br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

It has double the action and two different villains made the plot even more interesting. Unlike the previous movie, this one was had some funny moments..which were totally awesome. Now what can be said about the cast's acting? They all, in my opinion acted extraordinarily. Apart from Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, Dane DehHaan and Jamie Fox's acting was mesmerizing. The fight was great and the character of Spider-Man was funny at times.However, this being a superhero action movie, had some unnecessary romantic scenes between Spider-Man and Gwen.For that I give this movie 9 stars.

","Plot<br/><br/>Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is a brilliant little worker at Oscorp, but he is routinely mistreated and given no credit for his work which his company has made a fortune on. One day Max inadvertently stumbles into oncoming traffic and then is saved by Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). From that time on Max is obsessed with all things Spider-Man. Then one night Max is forced to work late on his birthday and while doing so accidentally falls victim to his own extreme awkwardness and ends up getting himself electrocuted and consequently becoming a super-powered entity known as the Electro. Needless to say Electro goes on a path of destruction and when Spiderman-Man tries to stop him and we soon see that Electro's hero worship of Spider-Man has become that overwhelming hatred. Meanwhile Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) shows up in town and takes over Oscorp after his father's passing. Harry is an old friend of Peter Parker and when Peter comes to visit Harry, Harry confides in him that he is dying and the only thing that can save him is Spider-Man's blood. Since it is public knowledge that Peter Parker takes photos of Spider- man Harry believes that his friend Peter can get word to him. Now Peter is face with letting his friend die or dealing with the ramifications of giving someone his highly advance blood.<br/><br/>Character Development<br/><br/>Playing a superhero can carry an emotional toll on someone's sense of well-being. Spider-Man is one of those superheroes where that toll is very taxing and in this film he is faced with turmoil outside of the battlefield which makes this story very compelling to a large degree. We soon learn from the beginning of the film that Peter Parker is be tugged down with the guilt of not keeping the promise he made with his girlfriend's father and these thoughts plague him throughout the film. Unlike a character like Superman, Spider-man is not bulletproof and his life in this film is held in consist jeopardy, yet he remains venerable just as much when he is just Peter Parker. <br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>I have heard some blow-back with Andrew Garfield playing the lead role of Spider-Man, but I find him serviceable to his predecessor who I did find was slightly annoying at times so I didn't really see the rub. In this film Jamie Foxx plays one of the villains and he did remind me of Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker in Spider-Man (2002) and if you can compare those two performances you can see what direction the others films took and see how these films differ. This Spider-Man is more confident and self-assured and I think that is a good thing. The only real flaw I can find is with Dane DeHaan, not this acting per se, but with the time he was allowed to do it. His time on screen was very light for that of a villain and didn't have much weight because of it, which in my mind came off as somewhat an afterthought as it did a means to an end in telling a story.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>When I compare Spider-Man (2002) with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) I have faced with some ground-breaking achievement, some brilliant improvements and I am not writing about the special effects that are much more enhanced. I am talking about the casting of Peter Parker's love interest Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who is many levels the superior performer of Kirsten Dunst who played Mary Jane Watson in Spider-Man and the rest of earlier series of films by Sam Raimi, it would have seem that the director wasn't in charge of the casting at all or lost a bet or something. Every minute Dunst was on the screen I would cringe, one moment she was saccharin sweet and the next she was unbelievable distant. She played the role with no range, no nuance. I do not know how I could fault the director when Dunst was the only indelible black mark on the picture which is ironic because she does look appealing on a movie poster after it has been touched up. If it wasn't so detrimental to the film it would be comical that Dunst plays an actress as part of her role. Why is it that those actors that play actors cannot act? I think it was true for Joey on Friends and that guy in Taxi who played a struggling actor. Maybe it is because they can play an actor slightly worst, but they know they cannot play an actor no better. Frankly I am surprised that Kirsten Dunst doesn't get more mockery from her name. Doesn't ""Dunst"" sound like ""dunce""? She does play to the stereotype of a dumb blonde after all. Somehow I am not one who finds that endearing and am glad to see that was improved on."

"Gerryt22","6","2","5","19 August 2014"," A film that proves that good performances can save a film
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not a great movie nor is it an awfully bad one. Although to many this film is as bad as Batman and Robin I personally believe this film was just simply 'good' but with many problems. For every pro there's a con. <br/><br/>In this second installment in the rebooted Spider-Man series leading man Andrew Garfield reprises the role of Spidey/Peter Parker and proves that he truly owns the role. What really saved this film for me was Garfield's performance. Garfield understands the character and how to bring him to life along with the help with director Marc Webb. One thing I've noticed with many of Garfield's performances is that he works well with other actors and actresses. I always enjoyed his on screen chemistry with Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network and now I can add Emma Stone, Sally Field and Dane DeHaan to that mix. Since the first Amazing Spider- Man I was always convinced with Garfield and Stone's chemistry. For a second I literally thought they were dating. Eventually after the first film the two actors started dating. Garfield is one lucky man. His chemistry with Field also works in so many levels. Field truly felt as if she were is caring aunt just as good as Rosemary Harris in the Raimi trilogy. The biggest standout to me was Garfield and DeHaan's chemistry. Just like Tobey Maguire and James Franco, Garfield and DeHaan acted as convincing best friends. So pretty much the main strength for this film are the performances and on screen chemistry. <br/><br/>One thing that has never disappointed me in a Spider-Man film (including the awful Spider-Man 3) are the action scenes. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 truly delivers some fun and beautifully shot action scenes. Marc Webb truly seems to understand how Spider-Man's powers work and visually brings them to the screen showcasing how skilled of a superhero Spidey is. Spider-Man's web-swinging in this film is without a doubt the best we've ever seen. At the end of the film you may feel as if you have gotten the feeling of vertigo. <br/><br/>One question that always runs through my mind is which Spider-Man series is better: Sam Raimi's series or Marc Webb's? MY answer: with the exception of the third film, Raimi had the better films, however, Webb's had a better leading actor. Webb's direction in this series so far has been a bit questionable. It feels as though Webb is a bit ill confident and unsure on where to take the film. It can literally go 5 ways. <br/><br/>The decision to have 3 villains bothers me. Now here's the thing, it's not that it's bad that there are 3 villains, it's bad that they didn't use them well. You can have 12 villains in a film but if you carefully make sure that each character is used well enough you can still have a great movie. First of all Rhino should NOT have been in the film. Second, Max Dillon's back story is not strong enough at all to justify him becoming a super villain nor do the audience feel empathy for him. And third, Golbin SHOULD have been the main leading villain. This is Spider-Man's arch nemesis! He's partially responsible for Gwen Stacy's death and therefore he should have been the main antagonist. <br/><br/>This film suffers the problems that Iron Man 2 suffered and that it felt more like a set up film. Iron Man 2 was criticized for feeling more like a set up for The Avengers. Since The Avengers was a proved success Iron Man 2's cons were seemingly forgiven. Amazing Spider-Man 2 sets up Sinister Six. Problem is now if Sinister Six fails then all this set up work has been done for nothing. <br/><br/>Overall even though this film has it's many share of problems it's still a solid entertaining film. The action scenes dazzle and Garfield steals the show with his performance. The film suffers problems that Raimi's Spider-Man 3 had and that is badly used villains and overstuffed plot, however, Amazing Spider-Man 2 at least did the overstuffed plot better and that everything is connected is done for a reason. At this point all we can ask for now is for extreme improvements for the next Spider-Man film. In this day in age it seems as though Spider-Man is no longer the cool kid in the superhero movie block, under shadowed by the likes of Iron Man, Batman, Superman, and Thor. Hopefully Amazing Spider-Man 3 will remind us all why we love Spider-Man.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>-Gerry T"

","I don't even know where to begin.<br/><br/>This film fails on almost every level. The pacing is all over the place, the character arcs are underdeveloped, the story is incredibly inconsistent, and this movie clearly just exists to sell advertising.<br/><br/>There are constant subplots that could have just as easily become self-contained movies, but nope! Sony crams everything in because they need to sell merchandise! And if that wasn't enough, the in-your-face product placement will certainly discourage you faster. Every TV and computer shown are Sony branded. No thought or care was put into making this film.<br/><br/>Let's see: three villains, criminally underused in the film, and even when they are used, the narrative and dialogue are just disastrous. Also, Peter Parker's on-off relationship with Gwen Stacy takes up way too much of the running time. They try to give us closure as to what happens to Peter's parents, but the only problem is that nobody cares.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx plays Max Dillon, an Oscorp engineer, who might as well have a neon sign over him saying ""NERD"" because all the clichéd stereotypes are overblown here. He has no friends, nobody pays attention to him apart from Peter and Gwen. He forms an obsession of Spiderman because he got saved once by him. He gets electrocuted by electric eels after falling into the most precariously placed tank ever and becomes Electro, whose change of heart about Spiderman is so quick, blink and you'll miss it.<br/><br/>Dane DeHaan plays Harry Osborn, Peter's 'childhood friend'? The way this is written is done so poorly. They haven't met in ten years and automatically they're best friends? At least Sam Raimi's series was consistent. Basically, Harry is dying from a hereditary disease that killed his father Norman. For no adequately explained reason, he is dying at a more accelerated rate and is desperate for the healing factor in Spiderman's blood. Thanks to the 'logic' of Peter taking a picture of Spiderman meaning Peter knows Spiderman, Harry pressures Peter into trying to bring Spiderman to him. The motivations and character driven plots are executed so badly.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti plays the Rhino for about five minutes of the overall running time and the worst thing is, we have no idea what the actual conclusion of that fight was! There is no natural flow to this movie at all. It only exists because Sony wanted to build an expanded Cinematic Universe and they kept alluding to the Sinister Six. How arrogant do you need to be to think, ""Oh yeah, we don't have to put effort into this film because we're guaranteed a sequel either way!"" Just as well there's no follow-up because, to be honest, where do you go from here?! Andrew Garfield is way too handsome and charismatic as Peter Parker. He's just a hipster, and kind of an ass, to be honest. In the opening scene, he prioritises his wise-cracks over the lives of civilians.<br/><br/>I'm just gonna stop because this brings back Vietnam flashbacks every time. We're depending on you, Tom Holland. That's all I'm saying."

","Finally, the chance for Marvel to rectify their greatest mistake... and they blew it. Stone's Gwen Stacy is marvelous. She makes the movie. Frankly, I have no interest in this Spider-Man series from here on. Anyone beside Gwen will be a let down. Everyone in the theater was pulling for Gwen to make it this time. But everyone left in a solemn mood. There was no applause at the end of this movie. Terrible, terrible ending! There was also the overuse of a boring Electro and not enough Green Goblin. The ""mystery"" of Pete's dad was pretty much of a letdown, though the knowledge of his use of personal DNA explains why no one else benefited from the spider venom. But the main deal was, I, like many others left the theater depressed and sad for a pointless death. We will miss Gwen Stacy and this may be the end of the Spider-Man franchise. Who made this terrible decision? They should go to a theater and watch the audience at the end of this movie."

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a tightly knit action/drama/thriller movie (in that order) with quite possibly the cast with the best chemistry. The movie stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Sally Field who return from the previous installment, while introducing a whole bunch of Super- Villains including Jamie Foxx, Dann DeHann & Paul Giamatti (in that order of importance). The movie is packed with strong CGI, and some very good action, but there's also enough room for characters to grow withing the movie. The score is strong (except for one tiny scene) with Hans Zimmer doing his thing again & the story element is at it's best. The only things that could bother you are, the short running time, along with a certain action scene which was made way too short that it's original script. Some of the dramatic scenes are extended but don't add much depth, only taking up more time.<br/><br/>All in all, I was screaming my way all through the movie, and if you're one to go enjoy a movie for what it is (Comic Book Fun)You're in for a treat. IMO for me, Spider-Man 2 is shaping up to be the movie event of the year."

","Keeping New York safe is no easy task, and with Gwen(Stone, sweet and her own person) possibly on a different path than him with an Oxford scholarship, Peter(Garfield, a lovable, quipping nerd that we can relate to) faces possibly losing her, in spite of how much they love each other, and this continued strong romance keeps us engaged. Worse still, as much as he desperately wants to fix everything, keep everyone safe, not everything will work out that well – there is tragedy in the air. This takes the form of the return after a decade of his troubled childhood friend, Harry Osborn(DeHaan, lost between a psychotic determination and a charming accessibility, doing justice to both), and the deadly new face, Electro(Foxx, obsessed fan turned dangerous villain, compelling as both, and largely sympathetic).<br/><br/>Boring origin retread out of the way, this can go into the nature of our protagonist, and deliver on the sad, ""chin-up"" aspect of him. This is the Spider-Man I grew up reading. The best aspects of this are the drama and character dynamics. Real people with actual problems that don't have easy solutions. There are troubles from the attempts to Avengers this franchise, with a lot of setup for the Sinister Six to appear down the line. Do not get me started on the disappointing reveal to the conspiracy/mystery parents plot, which should have been resolved in the first, not to mention never introduced in the first place. This adds up to too much going on, taking away time for the better elements. We get a fast pace that both helps and hurts the whole.<br/><br/>Production is, indeed, amazing. Truly captivating is the musical theme, synthesize-voice-enhancement and chilling look of our genuinely lethal electric baddie. Swooping, intense and fun action keeps us entertained throughout, and the 3D is fantastic for it – even if it is the only place that visual effect is applied. The tonal shifts can almost lead to whiplash. Humor is great, with ad-libbed dialog, tons of small gags, none of it forced.<br/><br/>There is some violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of everyone's favorite web-slinger. 8/10"
"brchthethird","6","3","10","14 November 2014"," Didn't Sony learn their lesson from Spider-Man 3?
","While I wasn't initially excited about having this franchise rebooted so soon, I did enjoy THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN even if it did rehash the same old origin story that fans are all too familiar with. Here, the sequel is bigger but not quite to its advantage. First off, I'll say that Andrew Garfield is excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Even if he's not quite an awkward, geeky character, he at least has the wisecracking down to a 't.' Emma Stone also does an excellent job as Gwen Stacy. And the relationship between her and Peter is done rather well. In general, the cast gives good performances, with a couple of big exceptions though. The special effects are also top-notch, and Electro has a few scenes to show off his powers that really impressed me, even on my laptop.<br/><br/>However, the area where this film falls short is the script. I'm no fan of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and they deliver an overstuffed narrative that tries to juggle too many characters and subplots, to the point where several of them feel shoehorned in as fan service. For this film to have been effective, Electro should have been the sole villain. You would have thought that Sony learned their lesson with Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 3, but they obviously didn't. Green Goblin's introduction (and one of its consequences) feels rushed and tacked on to the end, while Rhino was completely superfluous. And to make matters worse, Paul Giamatti completely hams it up in the worst way possible.<br/><br/>To touch on a couple other things, the plot is so unwieldy that certain scenes stick out as the contrivances they are, merely excuses for characters to meet and exchange information, or for exposition. Overall, this movie's greatest sin is that it tried to do too much and as a result it was a good half-hour too long. Certain characters and subplots could have been left out so that more time could be devoted to fleshing out the main story. In the end, what you're left with is a visually impressive comic book movie that feels like a stepping stone to something else, in this case a Sinister Six movie. If you're a fan of these movies, or the Spider-Man character, just go ahead and see it if you haven't already. For everyone else, just stick to Sam Raimi's trilogy."

","As a Marvel and comic fan I am disappointed that Marvel have produced another SpiderMan movie and offered nothing new. Same plot, same villains and same relationship drama.<br/><br/>The villains are completed underdeveloped. I am unable to understand why Electro wanted to destroy the city and kill Spiderman, and how his power worked. He simply shot bursts of electricity and appeared to be intangible. Then the Hobgoblin appears after an injection of blood and somehow can fight, is angry and can harness all the new gadgets. There was no attempt to develop these characters. Instead, we are forced to suffer through SpiderMan and Gwen's relationship troubles. It is so typical and tedious; c'mon give us something new. How many times can we see Spidey in relationship troubles? It was almost a RomCom.<br/><br/>I can appreciate that this movie should appeal to younger audiences but for anyone that has experienced a SpiderMan (or Marvel) movie this is a serious let-down.<br/><br/>A good point: good acting Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone."

","At the time of this writing, there are like 800 reviews. No one's going to read mine. So I can say what I want. It's very freeing really..<br/><br/>OK. I was disappointed. I can qualify that by saying that I wasn't expecting realism or depth of story or anything. I was expecting bad animation, comic-book style fighting scenes, cgi everywhere.<br/><br/>Hey! I got it. Right? So why didn't I enjoy the film? Mostly because the rushjob that this movie considered ""character development."" Almost every character in the movie was very shallow and behaved like a child. You have the characters who change their minds at the drop of a hat. At least two of them were like, ""I love you spider man! Unless you disappoint me, then I will MAKE YOU MY NEMESIS AND HATE YOU TO MY GRAVE!"" The flip-flops were almost dizzying. It was very elementary school. You know, this person is your friend one day and then not the next. Kids pick and choose their friends rather easily and honestly, but adults usually practice the art more subversively.<br/><br/>Then you have the character of spider man himself. I think it's worth noting that Peter Parker was originally envisioned as a fairly normal fellow, maybe a little bit shy. You know, the classic nerd who becomes a man through somewhat extra-normal means. It's a well used cliché and people identify with it because everyone feels like the shy nerd sometimes.<br/><br/>But in this film, the spiderman was not a shy little nerd. No, he's a talky teen, a ladies man, full of himself, with snarky comments for everyone. I actually have no problem with this, I found the change rather interesting. I'm just mentioning it because it is different.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel that the movie was made for teens. It has precious little appeal to mature adult audiences, even those who grew up with the comic books."
"troy-manatunga","7","3","10","5 August 2014"," The Plot Twist!
",".. Contains Spoilers.<br/><br/>THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 here on mentioned as AMS2 will take one by a great disbelief as the movie wraps up. A brave move some would say that was taken by Marc Webb in writing out the character of Gwen Stacy (Stone) although this may too hurt the franchise that is in the process of rebuilding itself. AMS2 always has been true to the original comics than the Toby Maguire franchise ever was. Marc Webb and his team go further and stay true to the comic issue #121 (June 1973) ""The Night that Gwen Stacy Died"" by having Gwen (Stone) fall down a tower to her death with the whiplash effect of Spider Mans rescue attempt.<br/><br/>What does this mean for the franchise? This is the most obvious question now. In a time where most superhero movies are being revamped over and over again for its monetary potential many production houses are torn between storytelling vs franchise building. The AMS franchise or any franchise for that matter is not made only for those that once owned the comic. It is for the masses. The previous trilogy saw Mary Jane and Peter Parker all the way through. This time we had Peter Parker and his first serious girlfriends Gwen fall in love. This is what people at times pay to see. So what exactly does Sony have in mind? Looking at how truthful they are to the original story line and also the fact that Mary Jane was in AMS2 but was scrapped off during the last minute only means that we could be looking at Peter and Mary once again sharing the upside down kiss in AMS3? As far as the storytelling aspect of the situation is concerned it seems like Sony has everything under control. In terms of the franchise build it most certainly could have benefited much more had they kept on Emma Stone for the next movie at least. Would you want to watch AMS3 knowing that Gwen Stacey won't be in it? <br/><br/>You will feel that AMS2 roll and toss a bit more than to its liking as it is trying to milk the most out a shabbily written screenplay. The movies were released in quick succession and indeed it is evident that that screenplay is rushed. Frustration and desperation is seen as AMS2 struggles to achieve the height of action as is in the first movie from 2012. Spider Man depends more on humor of Garfield than having to actually work for the Super Hero status during the better half of the movie. In fact Spiderman is often saved by Gwen Stacy than the other way around. Furthermore with numerous villains (Electro, The Rhino, The Green Goblin) introduced within, the spotlight at times is taken off by Electro who is by far the coolest villain to appear on the Spiderman set. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is brilliant and the CGI surrounding electro and the entire production is a marvel (Lol). The CGI may seem too ambitious to some but we have to come into terms that it is 2014 and Hollywood has to go with the flow. The first major screen time for Electro at Times Square in the heart of Manhattan is one of the favorite moments in the movie. The cinematography is a whole new level and it's obvious that Marc Webb was reaching out for 3D! This dear reader will blow your mind!<br/><br/>Losing a loved one isn't something new to Superheroes. Killing a wife, mother, sister or girlfriend always has been a tool to spark a certain desire for vengeance in a Superhero. So with Gwen passing Peter Parker burns from within. Marc Webb has announced that AMS3 will be the last movie he will direct of his franchise. AMS was brilliant in its first outing in 2012 whereas AMS2 seems like its spends most of its time setting the stage for AMS3. We are introduced to Harry Osborne and the Green Goblin briefly. This is only to plant the seed of vengeance between the Goblin & Peter. We don't know what happens with The Rhino as the movie ends in a cliff hanger. So in a way the ultimate stage has been set? Peter Angry, The Rhino on the loose and Oscorp have many more villains hidden in its basement.<br/><br/>What can Parker and Webb put together for the fans at the next visit of our friendly neighborhood spider man.<br/><br/>TITLE: THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN DIRECTED BY: MARC WEBB STARRING: ANDREW GARFIELD, EMMA STONE,JAMIE FOXX, DANE DEHAAN & PAUL GIAMATTI RATED: PG 13 RATING: 6.5/10 RUNTIME: 142 MINUTES"
"Kyleeeeeeeeeeeeeee","3","3","10","22 July 2014"," Spiderman is back and must save innocents from even more villains!
","I have noticed a general split with this movie. People either love it or hate it. So I went to see the movie with this in mind, and although I don't want to be on the negative (especially because I liked the first one), I have to say that this film is a mess. It suffers from trying too hard to be good while at the same time trying to be popular with the audience. That makes the film fall apart. I knew that the negative reviews had to be from one of two things-the dialogue or the tone, and surprisingly it was the dialogue that weakened the film. This is what makes people either love or hate the film. Fans of the movie get into the relationship between Peter and Gwen, mainly because the dialogue was awkward and somewhat relatable. To me, however, it just made the movie look even more lazy and I just couldn't get into the relationship. Remember how I mentioned the problem this film has by trying to be too cool? This is shown through the music. Electro's music seemingly consists of dubstep. Even Spiderman addresses this in the stupidest manner possible (""I hate this song!"" What an obvious way to get people to buy the soundtrack.) There was also a VERY unfitting Phillip Phillips song in the movie as well, again to draw audience members in with the sole purpose of purchasing the song. Also, I didn't understand some of the plot points. Like why did Electro turn against Spiderman so quickly! You were so goggly-eyed towards literally seconds ago! Oh right they need Electro to turn evil quickly so they can get to the other villains! I mean come on, who needs character development! Oh, and the ending was ridiculous too. A little kid almost dies from absolute stupidity (You are not Spiderman! YOU ARE NOT!) Enough about me complaining, what did I like about the movie? Well for one, the climax was handled very well and maturely. (no spoilers here, but those who have seen the film know exactly what I'm talking about). Also, the design of Electro was very cool and creative. However, that alone can't save a messy movie with weak plot points, a lengthy romance (more romance than action btw) and weak dialogue that lead to a very problematic sequel."
"sam-shaw7349","5","3","10","14 June 2014"," The Increasingly Mediocre Spider-Man
","Everyone on my facebook seems to be rating this film highly, so rather than moan obnoxiously at them telling them they're wrong I thought I'd get my frustrations about the film out here and go the passive aggressive route by just linking them to the review later. First of all, I didn't hate it. To me it was just nothing. Just a nothing film. Quite uninvolving, boring, by the numbers, cynical, forgettable.<br/><br/>I feel like maybe if I had seen it 10 years ago I would've enjoyed it more, but I've seen a lot of superhero movies now, so they really have to try a bit harder than this one does. It just felt like it went this bit, and then this bit and then this bit and then this bit etc, just going through the standard superhero motions with nothing really surprising or original about it. Except maybe one thing, that I won't spoil.<br/><br/>I don't understand why there needs to be more than one villain, the film feels overstuffed. Not enough time is given to any of them so you don't particularly care about them or the motivations for their bad behaviour. A lot of the time Amazing Spdey 2 feels like nothing more than a set up for this expanded universe they're developing; but a film needs to work on its own and this one doesn't really.<br/><br/>The good points; it was certainly better than the first Amazing Spider- Man, which was totally redundant rubbish, I saw it on a pretty big screen and I was sitting very close to it, so it took up all the periphery of my vision and I have an enormous fear of heights so during the bits where he was swinging through the skyscrapers of New York I must admit I got that falling feeling in my stomach you get on rollercoasters. That was pretty cool, that's never happened to me at the cinema before.<br/><br/>In summation, not a terrible film, but a terribly by the numbers and unimaginative one. This new Spider man series is not going well so far, and I do not have high hopes for the next one. I miss Raimi."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","10","7 June 2014"," Strong sequel worth the original
","Marc Webb does it again, delivering an excellent sequel that continues the story line, doesn't dumb down the characters, maintains its strengths, and for the most part improves on its weaknesses. In essence a perfect sequel.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone reprise their roles and the two are just as adorable and lovable together as they were in the first film. And it's surprising how well their chemistry can overcome even the worst clichés. In a weaker film their particular romantic subplot would be painful to watch and you'd know instantly how it'd end. Not so much here. Their character have enough depth and they're played well enough that you not only buy it but you'll also feel like it could go either way. And that's good storytelling.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the special effects and all the technical aspects are just as good as they were before. The fight scenes are still a lot of fun and this time even the settings are more grandeur and imaginative. The way they have realized the so called ""spidey sense"" is very cool to look at.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the villains are still not that good. The more realistic tone and setting mean that their over-the-topness seems more silly than fun and they're not given as much room to shine as in the original trilogy. They're perhaps a bit improved from the previous film, but there's the new problem of there being too many of them. Hopefully the third installment can fix this one glaring weakness.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great film. If you enjoyed the first film, this is definitely worth a watch, and even if you haven't, it's one of the best superhero films in recent years."
"Theshapeo31","5","3","10","16 May 2014"," Improvement over the Previous Installment....But not much...
","I've been a fan of Spider-Man since I was a kid, watching the animated series and eventually Sam Raimi's trilogy. I was excited for a new movie in 2012, then I saw it and it sucked HARD. This movie is improvement but not much, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a perfect example of Hollywoods false advertising. The trailers of this movie were packed with action scenes of Spider-Man fighting Electro, Rhino, scuffles of Peter and Harry Osbourne (also that one scene in the trailers were Peter said Oscorp has had Peter under surveillance isn't in the movie at all.....). There really isn't much action in the movie really only 2 or 3 fight scenes as the movie is primarily about the relationship of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy which isn't too bad and is actually pretty good (Emma Stone was really the only thing I liked about the 1st film, and she's no exception to being good here). <br/><br/>Really the only good things in the movie: 1. Gwen Stacy & Peter Parker's relationship 2. Jamie Foxx as Electro 3. Electro vs. Spider-Man (Round 2) and that's about it<br/><br/>Cons of TASM2 1. Dane Dahaad as Harry Osbourne (over the top and unbelievable) 2. Green Goblin and Rhino (both were pretty pointless, The Green Goblin shows up RIGHT at the end JUST to kill Gwen Stacy than gets knocked out before she dies, and Rhino just had no business being in the movie at all). 3. The ending (The movie should've ended with Peter at Gwen's grave and consider retiring from hero work)<br/><br/>The movie I can't really explain in full detail with 1,000 characters but you should get the point. The movie is improvement but not much I still prefer Sam Raimi's trilogy (even the underrated Spider-Man 3) over Marc Webb's trilogy. The ending really hurt the movie, it would've been better off ending at Gwen's funeral and Peter contemplating his life as a superhero and the end credits could've been something that foreshadows Venom or the Sinister Six as the next villains of the sequel."

I was speechless as I got out of the cinema. The soundtrack is awesome and pretty cool to listen to continuously. Hans Zimmer and the Magnificent Six did a much better job then James Horner (his soundtrack was still good too).<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie is stunning. It is a must see."
"slicedbread117","8","3","10","11 May 2014"," Some Wonky Dialouge and Underwhelming Villains Can't Stop Spider-Man From Stealing the Show
","In 2012, Marvel kicked off a reboot series for their flagship character, Spider-Man, after Sam Raimi's Spider-Man series had been shut down. After debuting with a solid first entry, Sony announced plans to create a cinematic universe of its own within the confines of just Spider-Man property. Enter The Amazing Spider-Man 2, a film with some occasional issues, but the best adaptation of Spider-Man to date.<br/><br/>Now when I say that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the best Spidey adaptation yet, I don't necessarily mean the movie as a whole, I'm referring to the character Spider-Man himself. The absolute largest strength of this film is watching Spider-Man in his true comic book form. Complete with all of his wit and humor, super strength, incredible spider sense and even his wonderfully executed costume, this is the best depiction of the superhero Spider-Man in cinema history. My eyes were glued to the web-head every moment he was on screen. It was like he was pulled him right from the comic books, nailing the way he cracks jokes, fights and swings through New York. It goes to show that when your title character is as purely entertaining as Spidey is in this film, your audience is going to respond very positively.<br/><br/>Now backing Spider-Man's great adaptation is a solid plot, which portrays deep themes, and arguably the most emotional climax ever in a superhero film. The story of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 picks up where its predecessor left off and the film does a great job of filling in the audience with the first film's story without slowing down the movie too much. With so much going on, including the movie's main plot which revolves around the mysterious and threatening Oscorp, the terrific romantic subplot between Peter an Gwen, along with a slew of characters in the film, the movie is mostly well balanced. The theme of hope is a major theme in the movie, one that is displayed excellently, giving the film a level of emotion few superhero films can match. There is some inconsistent pacing at some points, and I was disappointed by another lack of a true appearance by The Daily Bugle. But outside of a couple pacing hiccups, and the embarrassingly ridiculous ending with The Rhino, the movie flows well enough to keep your attention throughout.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be a superhero movie without action, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 delivers on that front. The action is exciting, intense and often very vibrant and colorful, thanks to some incredible CG effects. Also, the hilarious wit of Spider-Man makes almost every action encounter entertaining on a different level.<br/><br/>The main villain of the film, Electro, is portrayed in his Ultimate comic book form, and this challenged the special effects team to create a memorable CG-enhanced character. Electro is a good villain: powerful, smart, and full of rage and he posses as a heavy threat to everyone's favorite wall crawler. However, Electro often is underwhelming and underdeveloped, and has some laughable dialogue. Could have had a better written Elector, but it could've been a lot worse.<br/><br/>For our second villain, we have Spidey's arch nemesis in the Green Goblin, a mediocre portrayal of the character, at best. Despite very minimal screen time, and underdevelopment, Green Goblin was a dark, dangerous and mostly enjoyable enemy. However, Goblin was undoubtedly rushed into the movie for spoiler-filled reasons and to get the ball rolling on the Sinister Six film. Green Goblin's alter ego, Harry Osborn, is done brilliantly and integral to the film, but Goblin himself was brought in too quickly to pull any weight behind the character. Overall, Spidey's villains are fun enough to watch, but struggle to maintain consistency throughout the film.<br/><br/>The cast of the film is loaded with star power and the talent on screen is not wasted. Andrew Garfield reprises his role as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, and his performance of Peter Parker was also fantastic. Garfield does a stellar job in displaying all of Peter's emotions, as well as capture his comedic side, giving a much better performance than in the first film. Opposite Garfield is the beautiful and talented Emma Stone, who once again plays Peter's love interest in Gwen Stacy. Stone's performance gives us the sense that she's in her prime, giving a spectacular performance. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is a strong one indeed, displaying numerous different emotions throughout the film. The chemistry is top notch, as dialogue flows seamlessly between the two. I could go as far as to say that this is arguably the best all around romance in a superhero film yet. <br/><br/>Star Jamie Foxx plays Max Dillon, AKA Electro, and gives a solid performance with what he was given. Foxx plays Dillon well, despite the characters lack of depth. Finally, Dane DeHaan plays Harry Osborn, Peter's old childhood friend who has returned to New York. While his performance as Green Goblin was decent, his presentation of Harry Osborn was even better. Harry plays a large role in the movie's story, and DeHaan gives a mature, enticing performance. The cast is great to say the least, the emotions drive the movie, and the actors giving off these emotions are splendid.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is easily one of the most popular comic book superheroes of all-time, and most would argue he ranks among the top three along with DC's two juggernaut heroes. It was essential that Spider-Man got the movie that he and his fans deserved, and while the film occasionally stumbles on poor dialogue and off-beat pacing (like the atrocious Rhino ending), Spider-Man himself and the action and wit he delivers catapults the film into greater territory, with just a few issues holding The Amazing Spider-Man 2 back from being the best Spider-Man movie of all-time. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Okay first of all I want to commend the director for displaying such beauty onto screen..<br/><br/>This spiderman movie captured the humor side of the character brilliantly throughout the film.. the emotion of peter parker and the actions of spiderman were portrayed as such that you would keep wanting to see him more...<br/><br/>The visuals of the movie was AWEESOMMMEEEE... and the music, the sound made it EVEN BETTER.... I mean Hans Zimmer did a fantastic job once again.. You will love Electro.. though i had my doubts about FOXX but he pulled it off quite well :D<br/><br/>The fight sequences could have been longer (cos i wanted to see more) but I have no complaints.. and Dane DeHaan was superb too.. Stan Lee was there too (obviously)... :D<br/><br/>You should watch it in 3d to enjoy the movie... A complete entertainment is what it was :D<br/><br/>To find out more go and be shocked ;) --- 9/10"
"DarthPaul85","6","3","10","9 May 2014"," Better than the first one, but seriously flawed.
","I'll be positive here- the movie did a very good job whenever spider-man was in the suit, doing his thing. <br/><br/>It maintains (and expands) the humor of spider-man (which the Rami films really lacked), and the choreography is the best yet- Spider-man finally moves like you think he should from the comics (or video games). <br/><br/>The villains are over-the-top (again), but for me that's part of the fun. The movie knows it's predictable, and I respect it for just kinda going with it. The acting overall is pretty on target, except from Garfield himself, who doesn't seem to know what to do during the serious scenes.<br/><br/>The ending actually kinda surprised me. You might see it coming, but I wasn't sure...I'll give them props for that.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes also just look really good- the CGI is *almost* to the point where it can seamlessly integrate into real footage...almost.<br/><br/>The music was also pretty good. Not as melodic as Elfman's score, but still a fun addition to the action.<br/><br/>Now to get all the negatives out in one paragraph: the dialogue is clichéd at best (lazy or aimless at worst), the tone of the movie is all over the place (is it campy? Is it serious? It tries to do both). The pacing is a bit off- starts with a promising sub-plot that gets a very rushed conclusion. Many characters are seemingly introduced for no reason, other than ""they're in the comic, so we'll mention them here too."" The plot over-relies on forced actions (meaning we see people change from good to bad or vice versa in the course of one scene). There's also just tons of little stupid things that are funny but unintentionally so (cinemasins will have a field day with this one). <br/><br/>So overall...I'd recommend it if you love spider-man and just want to see some fun spider-man action, and are willing to put up with a pretty terrible script and awkward pacing. On the other hand, if you hated the ""first"" one this one might not be enough of an improvement."
"Jacobhemphill96","9","3","10","7 May 2014"," Better than I Anticipated
","This was a major step up from the last film. The Amazing Spider Man 2 offers incredible action, drama and comedy all in one. Andrew Garfield has played Spider-Man much better than Tobey Macguire in my opinion. Garfield offers much more action and comedy and better web swinging than the old spider man ever did. I thought Jaime Fox would suck as electro once I saw the design but I was 100% wrong. Electro's new design is much more threatening than that of the comics and I thought it was a good update. Same with Paul Giamatti as the Rhino near the end and Dane Dehaan's new version of the green goblin. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was just as good here as she was in the first movie. There is also a major twist but I won't give anything away. Overall this is a definite must see."
"ad_upclose","9","3","10","4 May 2014"," Pretty close to Amazing...
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is comes pretty close on the promise of that second word in its title. From fantastic visuals that include easily the best Spidey swinging sequences to the potent chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, the film possesses plenty of absorbing elements.<br/><br/>The character of Spider-Man is in his element in this version; more confident, in tune with his abilities, and constantly reaching for that comic banter. As Peter Parker however, he is more conflicted as he constantly battles between abandonment issues of the past and progressing forward with Gwen Stacy. The latter relationship is in fact the heart of the film; there is some cheesiness but both Garfield and Stone are so adorable & genuine together that it's easy to let them carry on falling over each other. Garfield is probably the best actor I have seen along with Robert Downey Jr. & Christian Bale to play a superhero, showing a tremendous range of emotions & earnestness.<br/><br/>The villains of the film are a bit too comical for my liking, especially in their motivations. But hey, at this point I'm not sure what I want to see from them as long as their powers allow them to put up a decent fight. Jamie Foxx is given an excellent sequence at Times Square when he first comes head-on against our titular character. Marc Webb's direction in that scene is excellent as he creates an epic showcase using slow motion and wide-shots. He also manages to form a dramatic finale and one 'big' moment in particular that many superhero movies fall short on in terms of impact and resonance.<br/><br/>Overall, The Amazing Spiderman 2 never felt over bearing to me despite all the characters involved. It got me excited for the grander Spider- Man universe with the help of gripping story-telling, exhilarating action sequences, and emotion."
"Jnvoodoo2","9","3","10","3 May 2014"," Don't believe the HYPE!
","I had seen lots of bad critic reviews about this movie, but all contradictory with the other, some critics saying the beginning was slow, and then others saying it was to rush, and hundreds and hundreds of confusing problems, with all of this on mind I enter to the theater with really low prospect, but I left very happy with the result, one lesson learned, no one can decide what you like or not, or if is bad or good in a subjective way. <br/><br/>The film spreads lots of deep emotions, which reminds directly to famous Spider-man comics arcs, such as ""Spider-man Blue"" or ""The night Gwen Stacy died"". The acting of the main characters was stunning Dane Dehaan stole all the looks with the interpretation of an alcoholic and desperate Harry Osborn. Andrew Garfield show us what is the most accurate personality of Peter/Spidey to the date, some aspects of him that had been running around in the comics since his creation that had not been explored before or at least no in such a deep way, the hilarious unfunny humor that Spidey has in the Marvel comics for example. Andrew's talent is undeniable, and it says a lot of him that he could prove this in a superhero film, the expressions and feelings used on the final fight scene were so powerful, and one of the only believable reactions on a lost that I had seen in a movie. I'm not going to talk about the chemistry between the actors, it's just obvious that is magnificent.<br/><br/>The ""rush"" scenes in the beginning are still enjoyable, the fight scenes where intense, but maybe a little bit short, the character development of Max Dillion was a little exaggerated, they used a style of story telling that was a little bit different of what we are used to, the style of art used on screen it's different too.<br/><br/>Rhino was fine, and the last scene with him was refreshing.<br/><br/>Some auto-references where awesome, some others not so much but good anyway.<br/><br/>My biggest problem was the music, the use of the main theme when the big scenes where about to come where right, and the use of Dubstep on Electro scenes was nice, time to time, but there was an abuse of that resource, it's almost like the Magnificent 6 didn't want/ let you to forget or ignore that they are using Dubstep, almost annoying (but Electro... Electromic music... you get it, right?).<br/><br/>And I hated Dr.Kafka, everything of him, the character, and the style of interpretation or acting they choose to play the character, way too exaggerated, it's like they lost the track with the character, too... ""Surrealistic"" (aswell as some Max Dillion crazy scenes). <br/><br/>The CGI was fine, that point received many critics since the trailer, but they fixed it on the final cut. Absolutely loved the CGI they used on the people under the attack of Electro<br/><br/>These problems are just minimum if we think in the film as whole, the rest of the film was really Amazing. <br/><br/>The final fight scene is the best from begging to the tragical end. I wish it gets to be as iconic as the kiss scene of Spider-man 1, I still can't speak for the people who are not fans of comic based films, they always have a different opinion than the fans, for good or for bad. I wish my friends enjoy this film as I did, I can not guess what they will think about this movie.<br/><br/>Can't wait for TASM3, if they fix the rush and the other problems, it can be the best superhero movie, specially with the action of the S6 (if they are going to be on the movie).<br/><br/>P.S: English is not my born language so if they are any mistakes, I'm sorry, I hope you still respect this review despite that fact."
"ThePROGMind","8","3","10","3 May 2014"," A Structured, Impressive Attempt to Bring the Comics to Life
","Spider-man has had many a movie now. As a kid, I wanted a Spider-man movie so badly, and when Sam Raimi fulfilled that desire, I immediately loved his movies. Except now, I look back and realize how crappy those movies really were. While I still love Spider-man 2, the original and especially #3 were campy, far removed from the comics, and lackluster in story. In short, I loved them because they gave me Spider-man, and that's about it.<br/><br/>Fast forward to now, and we've been given two Amazing Spider-man movies. The first knocked my socks off, as I didn't think a studio would ever come so close to giving me the character as he should be. There were flaws, but not many. This second Amazing Spider-man movie is more than just a fun ride. It's more than just a bunch of fight scenes. There are four things that I love about this new movie.<br/><br/>First, it focuses on Peter Parker. We get to see his tears, his relationship flaws, his fears, and his problems. This film features some intensely emotional scenes between Peter and Gwen and also Peter and his Aunt May. These scenes are on point, with amazing acting on display. <br/><br/>Secondly, it focuses on Spider-man. This might seem like a strange point, but the first three movies focus on Spider-man by showing fights, by showing him swinging endlessly, and the like. However, Amazing Spider-man 2 gives us Spider-man as the comics portray him. A. He's really smart and uses his intelligence fluidly in battle. B. He's a smart ass. As much as I've heard that this movie's script is junk, I myself found it hilarious. C. We get to see the pain and the joy he experiences in being Spider-man.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the actions scenes are phenomenal. Not only is the CGI incredible, but the cinematography and choreography are graceful, impacting, and even a little scary. This film finds balance in providing some truly shocking and massive moments and in giving us Spider-man's cockiness and humor. It contrasts the darkness and the humor so well, and hits really hard with the ballsy action. The 3D added so much to all of this, too, as we are taken on a roller coaster as we follow Spider-man's acrobatic moves. The villains are pretty good, neither the best nor worst that we've seen. Jamie Foxx does an admirable job of being crazy, basically. Now that I think of it, both Electro and the Green Goblin are pretty mad. The Rhino is a bit of a disappointment, though, as I hoped for more screen time and perhaps a more personal look at him, instead of this hired muscle ploy. Either way, the battle scenes with these villains are fantastic.<br/><br/>Lastly, this film is structured like a work of art. It starts and ends with a battle versus a specific villain, and we get to see his attitude as it changes. He matures during this film; spiritually, personally, even physically, I think. He learns about true hope, true bravery, and even dealing with the past and future. The pinnacle event of the film will effect him forever, and the film masterfully tells the part, as they pull it almost exactly from the comics. It really impacted me as a viewer, even though I knew it was coming.<br/><br/>So, is Amazing Spider-man 2 the best superhero movie I've seen? No. Captain America 2 was significantly better. There are some pacing problems, some letdowns (especially the end), and some things I would have done differently. However, despite these small (and nitpicking) flaws, this is the best Spider-man movie yet. With a hilarious script, imposing and hard-hitting action, a wonderful tribute to one of the comics' best stories, and a fascinating look at Peter's past and his shaky present; Amazing Spider-man 2 exceeded my expectations."
"ahmedali3987","8","3","10","3 May 2014"," Amazing as compared to TASM1
","I found this installment pretty much enjoyable, the action scenes, the chemistry between Gwen and Peter is pretty neat and so are the characters (Jamie Fox and DeHann). I did not expect DeHann to do justice to the Harry Osborne character previously done by Franco but he did very well. Now as most of us know that there are complaints with regards to too much stuff and the movie just rushed, I would agree on that when it comes to Electro, he could have been given some more screen time but then again wasn't. Probably because I found him too powerful for Spidey to handle for long (him shooting all that electricity around like thunder). On the other hand, me feels that Goblin was given little time about which I have no reservations because the Goblin already got its full movie (Spiderman 1 and 2). <br/><br/>All in all a great movie and most spider-man fans will enjoy this one."

","This movie is much more better than other 'PARTS OR SERIES' of spider man. Marc Webb had took all the qualities of spider man inspired by comic has shown in this.<br/><br/>What truly works for the film is its emotional core. That's a strange thing to say for a superhero franchise, which is essentially telling you a story you already know. However, Garfield and Stone make the screen light up every time they are together and that's where the film's strength lies.<br/><br/>And with the fantastic touch of 3D makes the movie more SENSIBLE. But some how there was a very short role of GREEN GOBLIN which some how effected my excitement.But in the history of spider-man movie's ,it was REMARKABLE no doubt."
"ThomasDrufke","8","3","10","1 May 2014"," Even with it's flaws, its still a Spidey movie
","Yes this movie has some pretty big flaws, and yes I was somewhat let down because of my sky high expectations. But it's still highly entertaining and pretty fun. I really like this movie but I wanted to love it. Andrew Garfield is the definitive Spider-Man and is way more entertaining than Tobey Maguire ever was. And the love story between Peter and Gwen is twice as good as the Mary Jane and Peter story. This movie has some of the best scenes of any of the Spider-Man movies, and by far some of the most emotional. But I do feel like director Marc Webb threw almost everything into this film which became packed with far too many story threads. The story about who Peter's parents really were should have been resolved in the first movie, and this movie would have benefited without the opening deaths of them. But also the chemistry between Gwen and Peter is the best on screen duo in all of the franchise, so really I shouldn't be complaining.<br/><br/>The narrative itself is packed. I liked the multiple villain approach because at the least it kept us guessing what was next. But I also think the death of Electro was anti-climactic and should have been handled differently. Speaking of deaths, I don't believe for one second that Norman Osborn is dead. If you get Chris Cooper to play a villain you don't kill him off after 5 minutes of screen time. The death of Gwen Stacy hurt though. I knew it was coming but even then it was heartbreaking because of how much Peter is really at fault for all this. Garfield nailed that scene, and actually so did Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborn. For the limited time he got, he showed the true menacing (and actual Goblin) side we didn't get to see with the original Spider-Man film. Electro was cool but underused and somewhat wasted.<br/><br/>I liked the little hints to the future of the franchise, and especially the hints toward J.Jonah Jameson. The Sinister Six hints were also cool but question, are they going to be in Amazing Spider-Man 3? If not who will the villain be? Which by the way if the credits were really suppose to tease the Sinister Six it was too tough to tell, and didn't think the X-Men credit scene was needed, why not just give us an actual Spider-Man teaser.<br/><br/>Also it's worth noting how cool the scenes are when Spider-Man is just swinging around, it's definitely the best effects the franchise has had. Not to mention how cute that scene was with the kid dressing up like Spider-Man. I mean come on that's everybody's dream right? So my overall feelings are mostly positive. Anyone can enjoy this film, and I will see it a few more times so that should tell you something about it considering how expensive movies can be these days. Here's hoping the future of the franchise can make that GIANT step like The Dark Knight and Cap 2 did.<br/><br/>8.0/10"

","I was one of those people who liked The Amazing Spider-Man very much! I was really looking forward to this movie. In fact, it was my most anticipated movie of 2014. (http://instagram.com/p/kIfnuVpsB7/) When, I heard that Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci were hired to write this film, the excitement level went up. After all, they were the writers of Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness! And, I had faith in Marc Webb. I wanted this movie to be AWESOME, so bad! Unfortunately, it wasn't. :( Makes me sad and ANGRY! The plot of the movie was not VERY interesting. I liked the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. Their love story was one of the main focuses of this movie, but sadly the only one that was handled properly. I was kinda looking forward to both main villains of the movie but none of them satisfied me. I don't think Electro's motivation was so strong and although Goblin had a real reason to fight, he was given very less screen time. The action sequences were good, with some very good visuals. Also, the whole untold story was nothing ground-breaking. No real tensed situations, except ONE. However, the way they ended it was good. I can really see this universe going towards that Sinister Six story line. This movie felt so different than the previous one, and I think its mainly because of the writing. The writing was not good. I mean, there were so many cheesy moments. The humor, at times, it worked, at times, it didn't. Overall, the movie reminded me that these two guys were also the ones who wrote the fist 2 Transformers movies. The performances of every single actor in this movie were amazing. Andrew Garfield, that guy was born to play Spider-Man. The score of the movie was good but nothing compared to Batman or Superman scores that Hans Zimmer previously did. Now, the reason why I decided to give the spoiler warning in this review is because I wanted to mention a particular scene. GWEN STACY's DEATH! That scene was handled so awesomely, I mean it shocked me, made me sad. Although, that web looking like a hand was a cheesy thing but still, boy, did they do that scene so amazingly! Overall, I'd say that it was a disappointment for me as I expected it to be very good. It is a good popcorn flick but will be disappointing for those who have high hopes for it. I gave this movie a 7/10."
"davidpeacock1-890-449001","7","3","10","18 April 2014"," More Parker than Spidey
","Marc Webb returns to a universe that he seems to have well mapped out with a clear and bold vision. This instalment is another sequel, in another reboot of the Spider-Man franchise and one of my most anticipated films this year.. so far.<br/><br/>I went with my 8 year old son and we chose to view it in 2D, to appreciate the scenery chewing web-flight sequences (and they are the best I've ever seen in this series). Apart from an electric eel staring at the camera, I could not see any part of the film that would be improved by wearing chunky spectacles. <br/><br/>The tagline is 'His greatest battle begins' but we soon discover that the battle is not between Spiderman and his enemies, but between Peter Parker and growing up.<br/><br/>Webb is determined to stamp his mark and set this reboot as the one by which all else will be measured. He begins his character driven movie by introducing a previously (in film) unknown backstory concerning Peter's parents. While it adds another level to the drama, it does feel a little forced and somewhat unnecessary, but it is only part of the many strands that makes this outing a treasure-trove of studies on relationships.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the story is the love triangle between Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker and Spider-Man. They are stepping cautiously into adulthood, and have serious choices to make about their professional, romantic and superhero futures now that they are leaving high school behind. Gwen is unsure if she can cope with Peter's fear of what may happen if they stay together and Peter is haunted by his promise to Gwen's father to keep her away from the dangers of his new life and the conflict this creates within himself. It is evident that Peter loves being Spiderman almost as much as he loves Gwen. It is a credit to the director and Andrew Garfield that we feel his pain at the cost and weight of the role as he considers the impact of it upon those he loves. The theme of 'with great power comes great responsibility' is Spidey's USP and it ramped right up in this film. <br/><br/>The relationship between Gwen and Peter is portrayed with a casual grace, depth and believability (their real life coupling crosses naturally into film) and the on screen chemistry between Garfield and Stone is palpable. At times, the fact that the actors are so credible stops the film descending into laborious schmaltz.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is excellent, both as Peter Parker and Webby, and conveys his alter ego with humour and cheeky charm. We really get the feeling that Spiderman is always just Peter Parker wearing a mask. It is by far my favourite portrayal of the friendly neighbourhood web-slinger.<br/><br/>The love theme and exploration of the interaction in relationships continues with all the main characters. Max Dillon thinks he is a nobody and falls in fan-love with Spiderman after he rescues him, telling him he needs him. Harry Osborn loves Peter after the shared experience of childhood abandonment creates a bond between them that remains strong despite ten years apart. Sally Field's Aunt May is perfect as a woman struggling with the loss of her husband and the growing up of the nephew she raised. There is a spark between them which showcases yet more truthful chemistry between Garfield and his co-stars. I laughed out loud twice during the film, once when Aunt May almost catches Peter out during a Spidey twist of the cliché of a teenager almost getting caught in his bedroom and the other was seeing Spider-Man in action while suffering from the dreaded Man-Flu.<br/><br/>With the exception of Rhino (who is a nonevent), the villains, like Sandman and others before them, in the Spidey universe are victims of circumstance and do not choose to become villains. Rather they allow life, rejection, betrayal and anger to shape them. Max Dillon's (Jamie Foxx) change to Electro is a little disappointing. Despite his power, there is little spark and his demise fizzles into the background. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan - looking impishly cruel yet vulnerable) makes a late but show stealing appearance as the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>At just over 140 minutes, it is a little too long, especially during the middle section which provides the emotional vehicle for the finale punch. I turned to my son several times during action sequences and said 'here we go', only for the film to return to its character driven core. It is essentially a love story with some superhero action scenes, whereas I tend to prefer my Spider-Man to be more.. Amazing. However, I sense that is all about to change and after the ending teaser for The Sinister Six, I'll definitely be at the front of the line for The Amazing Spider-Man 3."

","Never. I say this because is a hole new universe this adaptation of Marc Webb brings us: a Max Dillon fan of spider-man, a Fatherless Harry Osborn who's pushed so hard to the story that you can see it, a Parker legacy that's too dumb for me to accept and a center of the universe Oscorp that really weakens the concept of a multi-film and makes it predictable and boring.<br/><br/>How can Webb waste a relationship between Harry and Peter that way, its beyond me, happens so fast that you could never see or sense a real friendship and as a result we have no drama we have no deep story and makes this film fall short of a real comic book adaptation, sort of like what Sam Raimi did with Gwen on SM3.<br/><br/>The best scene is worth the ticket, that scene we all were waiting is there, so well done it almost makes me forget about all the sins committed here, that and the visually exciting web-slinging we had from the first movie.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie a 7 because it entertains and that's the hole point of going to the movies but It should have a better score considering the characters and the amazing story that at the end is all gone to waste."

Sony proves to me that they are willing to do anything with our friendly neighborhood spider man except surrender the rights back to Marvel. <br/><br/>Plot: This story is so convoluted and crowded that it makes my head spin. It drops to the lowest level when the scientist that was willing to do anything to stop the big Osbourne corporation from acquiring his research secrets but keep them a secret. He literally spells out for anyone to hear that his bloodline is the key to continue his work. How is he protecting Peter by doing this? The bad guys are bad just because the movie requires them to be. There is not a single compelling character in this film, not even Peter, who in comparison to the Universe everyone seems so eager to forget, has sacrificed nothing and suffered through no adversity. How is this comparable to the comics again ""fanboys""? The best part was Gwen's death and they ruined it in the same movie. They could have ended it right there with Peter sulking over her death and leaving me hungry for the next installment to see him get back on the saddle. But no, they were much more interested in throwing everything even the kitchen sink into this film and completely ruined something that had a decent start with The Amazing Spider-Man. <br/><br/>Verdict: Not worth it man. I'd rather suffer through Spider-Man 3 than endure this unnecessary reboot. Yeap, that bad."

Andrew Garfield once again is fine as Peter Parker and it's nice to see Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is still full of spunk as his love. Jamie Foxx is quite compelling as the main villain, Electro. Having a somewhat different background for Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) was also interesting. Quite lots of great action abounded but there's quite a touching denouement concerning Peter and Gwen that made both of us cry. I, myself, was thrilled to both see another Stan Lee cameo and hear the Spider-Man theme from the '60s TV animated show represented as a cell phone ring.

"wmhogg","1","7","35","23 August 2014"," Worst Spiderman Movie Ever
","Okay - I had read the reviews and I knew that this was not going to be a great movie. So, I went into it with lowered expectations. However, I cannot describe how far below even my lowest expectations this movie was.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Sally Fields, and Jamie Foxx all give fine performances. It's not their fault that the writing, directing, and editing were so terrible. <br/><br/>The characters behave with very little understandable motive for their actions except that the story needed them to act that way. For example, a man who worships Spiderman night and day suddenly, with just a minor provocation, wants nothing more out of life than to live in a world without Spiderman.<br/><br/>The clichés in the movie were awful. They even had a character to torture and study Jamie Foxx that spoke with a German accent, wore a black glove, and was in love with the pain he was able to inflict upon his subject. I've never seen that before...<br/><br/>The Green Goblin character seemed to be an after-thought, and very little effort was made to explain how this little waif, all of 115-pounds, suddenly had awesome fighting skills and amazing weapons. <br/><br/>I don't understand how the Marvel franchise can boast really entertaining films like Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers, and then turn this particular superhero over to writers and a director that obviously had little time to spend on their craft. Orci and Kurtzman have produced very high quality work in the past, so there is no excuse for this poor effort.<br/><br/>This is clearly the worst Spiderman ever, including the cheesy cartoon series from the 1970's. The most regrettable part of this is that everyone knows better. Everyone in the studio knew this was a bad script, and yet they let it get out the door and onto the screen in that condition.<br/><br/>I would love to know the back-story of how this film was made, and how the politics of this film allowed it to be completed and presented as if it were a comparable piece of the Marvel Superhero empire. Clearly, it's not a worthy effort of the studio, and should be shunned by all lovers of Spiderman."

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was overly hyped and there were too many spoilers in the trailers released before it came out.<br/><br/>But you won't need spoilers for you to watch this movie, because this movie is just as bad as the first one. I walked into the cinema thinking this movie was gonna be awesome, but i was wrong, this movie was terrible. I'll admit it had some pretty cool action sequences but that just isn't enough for a movie.<br/><br/>The cast in this movie is not the best, the Green Goblin is played by some feminine boy, and Electro played by Jamie Foxxx is not good at all. The transition of scenes are also terrible as they just shift from one scene to another, talking about something new. There's hardly any real build up of the characters as well. The acting isn't bad, but whoever directed it needs more work on his skills, because everything is badly placed. <br/><br/>If the next one isn't good please all sign a petition to get ""The Spectacular Spider-Man"" cartoon back, because it is 10x better than this movie franchise so far"
"vladp6","1","7","36","13 May 2014"," The complete nonsense
","I was watching this movie in IMAX 3D, and the only star I can give for CGI effects. But these days, CGI effects have become a routine and basic element of any action movie. Hollywood simply forgot how to make movies in a natural environment. It's so easy now - just put a group of 3D artists in a room, and they will do any movie for you in a short period of time with almost no expenses. There is even no need for good acting, the CGI effects will completely suppress good scenario, good acting, everything that once had values in cinematography. The tendency of Hollywood production is very clear - brainless, saturated with impressive CGI effects films, just to brainwash the audience. The modern audience like it because the majority of the modern generation does't want to think, to focus, to feel something, just relax with the bucket of popcorn and keg of coke. Watching such movies like Amazing Spider-Man 2 allows easily to browse and chat in the Facebook during the show. That's what the Hollywood ideologists want to do with the modern and future generation. This is how they see their own nation. And now we see the rating for this terrible movie - 7.5! I think Coppola and Spielberg rest already. Seriously, if you don't want to loose the great American nation in the nearest future, you should do something with this extremely low-quality flood; even censorship in this case, as a last resort, may work well."
"Aaron1375","9","3","11","14 May 2014"," This Spider-man is amazing and electrifying
","I went and saw this movie last week and enjoyed it immensely. I also enjoyed the previous Amazing Spider-man film, and quite frankly I liked all three of the previous trilogy as well. Okay, I am a huge Spider-man fan so almost anything with him in it is going to be something that in all likelihood I am going to enjoy. Heck, I even liked that live action series they did back in the 1970's featuring our favorite wall crawler in Los Angeles where he essentially shot huge ropes and fought criminal types. So yeah, I am probably not the most unbiased reviewer when it comes to our friendly neighborhood Spider-man. Still, I really like where this particular series is going, though surprisingly, this series seems like it is you either really love it or hate it. Kind of like last year's Man of Steel film. Still, to me, this film and the last one kind of capture the essence of Spidey a bit more than the previous three, in that when Spider-man is doing his thing, it just seems more like out of a comic book. Then again, the previous films were well done too and were first, so often times first trumps for no other reason than they were our first experience.<br/><br/>The story has Peter Parker/Spider-man fighting crime and having an on again and off again relationship with Gwen as his strong love for her and his need to keep her father's promise keep colliding. A man who for the most part has gone unnoticed takes an extreme liking to the wall crawler and then there is also an extreme shakeup at Oscorp as Norman Osborn's son has returned into the picture. All are linked by Oscorp as an accident will soon spawn a new deadly Spider-man foe as well as a father's gift to his son.<br/><br/>The villains were done very well. I liked Jamie Foxx's Electro whom many complain did not look like the Electro from the comics they read. He most certainly did not look like the Electro from the main series, but he does look a lot like the one from the ultimate series. There is also the Green Goblin and the Rhino for Spider-man to contend with as well, but Electro is by far the main one this time. All looked cool, but the best part were the fights, where James Garfield just does a better job at trash talking the enemies. Tobey made a good Peter Parker, but he never exhibited Spider-man's constant prattle that in the comics at times unhinged the enemies and lead to many a victory for Spidey, or made the enemy explode in a rage that made his trash talking backfire big time! <br/><br/>I am enjoying this new series of Spider-man films; though, even I admit they came a bit too soon on the heels of the first trilogy. I also hate it that the first set of films never had any closure, and I hope that will not be the case here. I find this series is doing a better job of establishing super villains, as there is a source and reason for them that is tied together, while the first one it was all pretty random and the coincidences just a bit too far fetched. However, I enjoyed those Spider-man films a lot and I am enjoying these a lot. Would it be cool if Spider-man could be in the universe of Marvel characters Disney and Marvel is establishing, absolutely. With that said though, I think Sony is doing a pretty good job. The main thing I disliked about this film is the strange inclusion of an X-men clip in the credits. I saw no point to this as it had no ties to the film I had just viewed, I read what was originally supposed to be included and it was a lot better than the very random clip I got. Overall, though, Spider-man made for another fun, summer film; however, once again I am a Spider-man fan so they really did not have to do much to impress me admittedly."

You get to see fun side of Peter parker and Spider man too. I don't like to write for long.. So in short Andrew Garfield - Best Choice for Spiderman Emma Stone- BEST Superhero Heroine Jammie Foxx- Electrifying The role of Normon is not as Big .. i guess they will give him more Space in next flick!

","Going in to this movie, I was pretty nervous that it wasn't going to be any good, I read some reviews from critics and it seemed that many people were displeased with the movie. I don't what their problems were with the movie because I thought it was incredible. The actors played their roles beautifully (especially Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, and Jamie Foxx wasn't too shabby either) and the action sequences kept me interested throughout the movie. Also if you're worried that the movie pulls a Spider- Man 3 and overwhelms the movie with villains, don't worry because the movie smoothly connects each villain to each other. Don't listen to what people have been saying and give Spidey a shot."
"ohashmawi","Null","3","11","3 May 2014"," Really underrated
","I was very pleasantly surprised to see that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is good. The movie tried to be a romance comedy, a summer blockbuster, a drama and an action movie, and it all worked decently enough.<br/><br/>The acting in TASM2 is very good, Andrew Garfield, really that guy is great, he is the best Spider Man ever, he's got the sarcasm down, the comedy aspects, everything, and not only as Spidey, he's the best Peter Parker too, he really sells a 20 year old, not really in the looks, but in the way he talks, his mannerisms and all. Emma Stone is incredible as Gwen, I absolutely love that woman, she is so awesome! Not only as an actress, but she's super fun off-screen too! She is the best! Anyway, her acting here is incredible. These two on a screen, best couple in the world. Their chemistry is palpable, it is astounding how well they are together, their romance throughout the movie is really great, their high-school fling was incredibly sold. Dane DeHaan, another actor who gave an incredible performance, him and Garfield also have incredible chemistry, those scenes where Harry and Peter are talking as friends, they were greatly acted. DeHaan plays his role perfectly, at the start, when he's friends with Peter he does a good job, then when he finds out about his condition, he gives a surprisingly amazing performance. He is deeply sinister yet appealing, and after he discovers that he's dying, he really sells the desperation that Harry feels. Later on when he teams up with Electro his performance drops down a bit, and even more when he becomes the Goblin, but he's very good otherwise. Jamie Foxx is another one who gives a really good performance, I really felt bad for his character, the fact that a guy as cool as Foxx was able to be convincing as a ""nobody"" type of character just proves how talented he is. The sympathy was kind of lost when he turned into Electro, he's fine, but the reason why he became villainous didn't really make a lot of sense to me. The rest of the supporting cast also provide good performances, nothing really worth mentioning though. (And to anyone thinking about Paul Giamatti, yes he was basically a cartoon, but that was the way his character was written, so he did do a good job.)<br/><br/>The writing in this movie is for the most part good, the jokes work really well, and the dialogue is good, excluding some of Electro's lines. Especially the romantic scenes with Emma and Andrew, that scene where they are talking about the ground rules is so cute! And realistic too. The story was the first of the only 2 problems I had with this movie. This film tried to include so many things, it's a good thing that they cut Mary Jane from it, or else it would have been way too crowded with different plots. A good part of the movie served to set up for future sequels and spin-offs, but I don't think that the film became too preoccupied with setting up and not with its own story. The main plot was pretty cool, but they stuffed to many side plots, there was the fact that Gwen was going to Oxford, Aunt May becoming a nurse and all, the whole Rhino thing which was really depressing and the mystery with Peter's parents. Another thing that I didn't really get was who was the main villain, I'm not really sure if it's Electro or the Goblin, cause the Goblin appears as the real antagonist in the end, but Electro was a villain for the most part of the movie. The villains were very jumbled. And don't even get me started on the planes during the final fight, that was just crazy and unnecessary.<br/><br/>The effects of the movie are spectacular, from the webs to the lightning, that final fight was incredible, the one with the Goblin, not the one with Electro, that one was pretty decent, but the one with the Goblin was very cool, the whole sequence inside the clock tower was masterfully directed. The soundtrack of the movie is also nice, every tune combined perfectly with each scene. However there's a LOT of dubstep in this movie, and I was a bit annoyed at that.(just a matter of personal preference.)<br/><br/>The second of my complaints towards this film is the marketing. It was really bad, first off there's the whole thing with Rhino, the movie is marketed as having 3 villains, Electro, Rhino and the Goblin, but that was a major mislead. Rhino is, and I kid you not, in the movie for 5 minutes tops. Another thing that really bothered me was that they absolutely spoiled the movie in the multiple trailers. They spoiled the whole climax, my friends who aren't even into Spider Man were able to correctly guess what happens in the climax just by watching the trailer. That is not a good sign. Something that I absolutely hated is that they put the last shot of the movie in most of the trailers. So if you've seen a trailer for this movie, it's likely that you've seen the last scene in the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has incredible acting, it has rom-com, drama, comedy and blockbuster elements, which is very cool. However the multiple plot lines and the tangled villains make it less than what it aspired to be. The marketing also spoiled it, which sucked, but overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a good movie, I feel that it was money well-spent, and I was mostly entertained from beginning to end."
"karnmaster","8","3","11","2 May 2014"," I think you are all watching a different movie...
","I seriously don't understand why the hate for this movie. Then again, a few of the reviews I've read on here mention MJ instead of Gwen, so clearly you have no idea what you are talking about. This movie was great! Andrew plays a great Spider-Man. He is a smart-ass and is constantly cracking jokes during battles. Also, his emotion throughout the movie, make you emotional and feel for every character. The chemistry between Andrew and Emma was incredible! I always looked forward to having them on screen together! The action was great! The plot had a couple of issues, but nothing to get all mad about. The way the three villains were used was perfect! The storyline was intriguing and left you wanting more which is the idea! If you enjoyed the first Amazing Spider-Man, you will definitely enjoy this one as well!"

"siru-tirronen","8","3","11","27 April 2014"," Traditional but new
","I loved Sam Raimi's Spiderman and Spiderman 2. Unfortunately that third movie was bad. Too much villains, too much everything. I was little nervous to see this 2010's Peter Parker. I hadn't seen the first one. So I went in to the movies and was pretty glad when I came out. The movie was pleasant, not perfect but worth of your money. Although the ambitious plot is this movie's weakness. First the visual styling were great. I really enjoy the cartoon like environment and Spiderman's climbing/flying in the sky. Andrew Garfield was surprisingly good in his role. I liked his arrogance and how he mocked his enemies. He brings also little energy for Peter character, more enthusiasm but in my opinion you can't compare Toby and Andrew. They both are great and unique. The enemies were alright but I think they had more potential than writers gave to them. Especially I liked a lot of Jaime Foxx's performance. You could empathize his character and the way he will be changed to super villain, I was positively surprised that they had tried to work out something accident styled situation which would be the reason how he will get his powers. What about Harry... I think Dane Dehaan made it alright. Compared to William Dafoe he didn't shine but I think the problem was the writers. Because there were so many enemies they didn't get a chance to change something more. But the acting was good and I loved that the director and the writers were surprisingly faithful to the original story. It was pleasant and even if I lost little of my enthusiasm in the middle of the movie I really enjoyed the end. It was exciting, and those who are very keen on to the cartoon details will be satisfied. If you have time, I recommend you go to see this movie."

"RemusGrey","5","2","6","5 September 2015"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a step backwards and mixes action and romance
","The Amazing Spider-Man separated itself from Sam Raimi's trilogy of Spider-Man movies by taking a more grounded direction. Rather than focus on spectacle, the movie delivered on smaller moments that had the character out of costume. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 still has a few of those moments, but it's clear that the focus has shifted. It is a brighter, louder film that's laying more groundwork for films down the road. The final product is still sometimes compelling, but as a whole it struggles under the weight of its clashing priorities.<br/><br/>There's a lot of ground to cover, and the narrative obviously strains to get to all of it. The film follows multiple plot lines that don't really intersect for much of the picture. There's enough material here for three movies, but the film stuffs it all together into one long picture. In the process, it sacrifices nuance. This is most noticeable in the Max Dillon thread, which largely features a series of broad clichés that closely resemble other villainous origin stories. Dillon comes off as terribly cartoonish, and that makes him a rather weak villain. The multiple plots fray at the seams, with sequences that reveal information but don't make much sense in the long run. There's a sequence, for example, that has Gwen Stacy evading Oscorp security. The consequences of her actions are never brought up again, however, the sequence seemingly existing in a vacuum. <br/><br/>As with the first film, the best moments are markedly subdued. Marc Webb's talent for shooting dialogue remains his best weapon, the film finding its charm in quieter moments that just have the characters hanging out. The film gains much from the flirtations of Peter and Gwen, and the chummy history between Peter and Harry. The film also gets to the core of the Spider-Man character in small moments that happen in between big fights, as he interacts with the people he's saving. It all gives the film a personality beyond the series of CGI-heavy fight sequences. <br/><br/>But there are much fewer of these moments now, the film beholden to the largeness of its plotting. It's a shame because it is these sequences that make best use out of the talented cast. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is as palpable as it was in the first film. It is actually pretty rare for superhero movies to have a love interest worth caring for, but the interactions of the two leads lends genuine weight to the relationship. Dane DeHaan lays it on a bit thick in his villainous moments, but he's pretty charming when just hanging out with Peter. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is palatable enough, but it feels like a step backwards plus mixing a comicbook action movie with a romance genre. Its predecessor had managed to find a nice balance between teenage drama and superheroics, delivering its charm through the contrast of its two sides. Here, the balance is tipped as the film is forced to deliver a surplus of plot. There is just too much being setup here, an action comic book movie mixed with romance leaving the film little time to fit in those tiny moments of human interaction that helps ground the superhero action."
"JonnyCampo","5","2","6","30 August 2015"," Nothing But Cheese
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 where do I start, first of all its not all that amazing they should rename it the mediocre spider man 2. it's not that this movie horrible because it's not, well actually it is but i still think its better than Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, its definitely worse than its predecessor. But it has its moments mostly between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield their chemistry is basically all this movie has going for it. This movie decently entertaining, good action scenes but not enough of them though with a very non epic final battle. I liked the introduction of all the new characters, and I like the idea of where it's going as a series but this movie just felt like a 2 hour filler to prepare us for what is next to come or at least a universe they were ""trying"" to set up. I mean I've seen a lot worse movies as far as superhero/comic movies go, so I'm not even gonna hate as hard as i want too, I just expected a lot more as far as comparing it to other superhero movies that marvels pumping out recently down at Disney. They put out an amazing new captain America movie with winter soldier and Fox did it with X-Men Days Of Future Past, this movie is no where in their ball park but it's good enough for a one time watch just at laugh at the cheese factor acting job from Oscar winner Jamie Foxx who gives us one of the worst performances of his career playing a lesser version of Jim Carrey's Riddler from Batman Forever its almost not watchable, Dane DeHaan is also frigin terrible playing a worse version of the same role he plays in Chronicle, and don't even get me started of the phoned in cameo by Paul Giamatti, who even admitted he thought the role was a joke. Another thing I'm tired of with spider man in general is the teen angst if I wanted to watch Breakfast Club I would watch Breakfast Club. I'm also tired of how all the characters come off as awkward losers that just don't fit in. and for god sake I wanna see some blood enough with the pg ratings even the comics are more graphic then the movies. anyways. 5 out of 10 if anything at all because it was cheese watch"
"pabloaf2000","4","2","6","23 September 2014"," Miss this mess
","Pandering piece of horse dung with virtually no redeeming qualities. Garfield and Stone are game actors yet wasted by this treacly ""story."" Essentially the Batman Forever of the Spider-man franchise, tossed off in an effort from Sony to sell merchandise and hold onto the license. The screenplay comes off as incredibly rushed, with horrible dialogue, and yet is strangely overstuffed as well. The ending comes out of of nowhere and was clearly just thrown in for the sake of impact. Characters change entirely with virtually no causation or explanation. I would say the effects were good if they contained any real world physics, coming off instead like live action Tex Avery cartoons. I wish Raimi would return and give this franchise the shot in the arm that Singer delivered with X-men 4."
"danumber40","4","2","6","18 September 2014"," A disappointing sequel to the exciting reboot
","I have to say that I didn't know what to expect with the first installment into this series reboot, but I very much enjoyed the first one. Andrew Garfield made a great Spider-Man and I loved it that his trademark quips were brought in. The new villain was cool.<br/><br/>This did not lead to my expectations at all.<br/><br/>The man's transformation into Electro was a little cliché and predictable, but everything based on the comics is predictable. I was okay with that.<br/><br/>Garfield's acting was spot-on, but Emma Stone was lame, for a lack of a better term. Her acting wasn't great and she had several cliché lines. Aunt May (Sally Field) and Peter Parker's lovely relationship that I very much adored in the original movies was not here. I think the original movies had one of the best family relationships I had ever seen (Aunt May and Peter Parker), and it just wasn't done well here. Harry Osborne (Dane Dehaan)looked like a creepy crackhead in high school that was starving himself. He didn't look like the calm but dangerous Harry I was familiar with. He was just really...weird. Finally, all Jamie Foxx did was make cliché (I frequently use this word) statements. His motives were a little whimsical as well, and his sudden changes in his views of Spider-Man were odd. I understood how he was feeling, but the swings were fast and extreme.<br/><br/>But bad acting can be overlooked with great fight scenes and explosions and the occasional funny joke, right? That's what helped me get through Transformers: Age of Extinction, which I was pleasantly surprised with. Anyways, the fight scenes were boring. They creators of the movie relied on airborne scenes and CGI effects, rather than cars crashing and blowing up and people being in danger. There were a lot of flashes of blue and pops of electricity. It was hard to tell what was going on. And when the Green Goblin (Harry) came in very, VERY late into the movie, the fight did not last a minute. No joke. ""I'm gonna get you, Spider-Man!"" ""Oh yeah? I'm gonna punch you!"" Then he punches him and knocks him out and the fight is over. In the original movie, Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were crashing through brick walls and throwing punches all over the place and tearing their suits and showing blood. The Goblin was even stabbed in the stomach without dying immediately. Here, it took one punch. Lame.<br/><br/>Gwen (Emma Stone) dies during the ""battle"" with the Goblin. It was a little surprising with its suddenness. Peter visits her tombstone several days of the year, and the camera shows the same angle over all the seasons. They were well-done scenes and emotional, one of the few good things of this movie.<br/><br/>In the final scenes of the movie, a criminal breaks out of jail and mans a robot that looks like a rhinoceros. Like we haven't seen that before. And he says something along the lines of ""Spider-Man, I'm going to DESTROY yooooooouuuu!!!!!"" The end. I'm guessing the next movie will feature a robot giraffe that can breathe fire.<br/><br/>There was one other really cool scene when a criminal is firing a machine gun or something at Spider-Man, but in slow motion, he's twisting away from each bullet. That was really cool.<br/><br/>Altogether, it was a very disappointing movie. It seems that half of the viewers liked it and half didn't, so you never know. You might enjoy it."
"Prahlis","5","2","6","24 August 2014"," A disappointing sequel
","Everything started out good when being thrown right into the action combined with some beautiful visual effects and a few good laughs, but after introducing Electro everything went downhill. Not only was his overall looks terribly executed, but his motives for wanting to kill Spider-Man and taking the power away from the entire city felt weak and forced for the story to make sense.<br/><br/>We also have the complicated relationship between Peter and Gwen. After leaving Gwen after her father's death in the previous movie, just to take her back five minutes before the credits we once again have to listen to Peter explaining why they can't be together, which kinda makes you feel like they haven't evolved one bit since the last movie. It's thanks to the incredible acting of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone that I feel like I really care about them and I guess that's why I was so bummed out.<br/><br/>Though a lot of things were great with this movie, such as visual effects and acting, including Dane DeHaan who did a great job portraying Harry Osborn, I can't help that feel that my overall problem with this film is the script. They mixed in too many villains and the script got to suffer. I never felt like we got to explore neither Harry nor Max enough to make their stories feel real.<br/><br/>Overall an okay movie that couldn't live up to the greatness of its predecessor."
"Vietboi29","5","2","6","27 May 2014"," Decent movie.
","I watched this movie on opening day, unfortunately it's not amazing as the title states. I have a few quips about this movie that I just didn't like.<br/><br/>1. Peter Parker is suppose to be a genius, unfortunately for us, the only thing Andrew Garfield shows us he is good at is reading someone else's research and citing it verbatim(Amazing Spider-Man). Here in this movie, he forgets the basic concept of electricity. <br/><br/>2. Spider-Man's quips were always sarcastic yet witty. Unfortunately Andrew Garfield's jokes comments off as a douche. <br/><br/>3. Electro is an electrical engineer here, yet his genius is never shown. We only get to see his mental illness, while the ending fight was decent it never wowed me. <br/><br/>4. Aleksei Systevich is suppose to be an intimidating strong force. The only thing that the Aleksei Systevich got right in this movie is the dimwittedness. I do not like the fact that he uses a large mechanical suit to be ""The Rhino"", meaning that if anyone else can get their hands on their suit they can be the rhino. <br/><br/>5. Harry Osborn, played by such a hipster douche, I rather take james Franco with his lazy eye. Again, the director gets it wrong. Harry is supposed to be using goblin serum, in here, they make it a hereditary disease that he becomes a goblin? Not only that, but his strength comes from Spider Venom? <br/><br/>The movie is decent, is it worth the price of admission? I say not, but if you can go see it at a discount theatre like I did, then yes it's worth the $5 and 2 hours out of your life. There's just so many things wrong with this movie that I didn't enjoy, the only thing they got right was the romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker, which was a lot better than the romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson from the Tobey version, but that's not Tobeys or the Sam Raimis fault, that was Kirstens, she made it very public that she did not enjoy the role and didn't want the role."
"tburke85","5","2","6","25 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider-man 2 A Mixed Bag
","The Amazing Spider-man 2 is a mixed bag there are some things I did like and others not so much which I will get into later. First off I'm not sure if Marc Webb is the right director for Spider-man. There was a lot of talking in this movie that didn't really go anywhere and not much action. Andrew Garfield really does embody Peter Parker/Spider-man. They got that aspect of the character down right. Emma Stone puts in a good performance as Gwen Stacy in her limited screen time. Jamie Foxx does what he can as Max Dillion who later becomes the villain Electro. Same goes for Dane DeHaan who pulls off a convincing performance as Harry Osborn. The rest of the cast including Sally Field and a brief appearance by Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn do the best they can with what little they were given. The action scenes are well staged when there is some but are very short and there isn't many of them. Maybe 5-6 action scenes tops throughout the film. Now onto the bad. Some of the dialogue isn't the greatest but this is coming from the writers of Transformers so don't expect anything like Nolans Batman trilogy. Electro was a cool villain visually development wise not so much. He did resemble Dr Manhattan from Watchmen I liked it nonetheless though. Unfortunately Electro spends most of the second half locked up after his first fight with Spider-man during the Times Square sequence. Foxx tried to elevate the material and gain sympathy from the audience but I blame the script and was given a couple cheesy lines. He did have godlike powers and they could have done so much more with the character. What was the point of having a powerful villain like that just to sideline him for the most of the movie till near the end. Just didn't make a lot of sense. DeHaan's Harry was actually well developed throughout the film but his Goblin is rushed and only gets at the most 3-5 minutes of screen time near the end. It's nothing more than a glorified cameo. He gets a brief fight with Spidey and then he's rather easily defeated like Electro. It's a shame because his look and laugh as Goblin was quite sinister. I didn't feel much of anything when Gwen met her fate because I just wasn't emotionally invested in the characters. They should've saved that for the next film and perhaps had Harry become the Goblin in a mid credits scene or something. I understand they're building up to the Sinister Six but it seemed like they were trying to hard to set things up for future sequels instead of just focusing on telling a coherent story. Paul Giamatti who I consider to be a good actor in other movies hammed it up way too much as the Rhino. He was just kinda stupid to me and his attempt at a Russian accent is dreadful. I couldn't understand almost a word he said luckily his character is limited to just 2 scenes. He wasn't pivotal to story besides providing the film with a few quick action scenes and to show the type of criminals Spider-man has been facing since the end of the first film. I really wanted to enjoy this movie but after it was over I was like that's it and just felt disappointed. Even though I had no expectations it was still a major letdown but that's just me."
"BaijuNair","7","2","6","5 May 2014"," A one time watch...
","Went over to see The Amazing Spider-Man 2 with my 4 year old daughter last weekend. To be honest the film is a bit of a let down with a lot of unwanted characters. There is nothing special in the movie which will make you think about watching it for a 2nd time. The chemistry between Andrew Garfiled and Emma Stone is the highlight of the movie. And obviously there is the usual thrills and spills one would associate with a Spiderman movie. Action sequences I felt was a bit overboard sometimes..Kids will love it for sure not so much with adults I would assume. Although I must confess that I am much more of a Tobey Maguire Spiderman fan than the one portrayed by Andrew Garfield."
"dehunter456","8","2","6","4 May 2014"," Good despite Flaws
","Unlike many people, I really enjoyed the first movie. Despite the plot holes and the lame villain, Garfield manages to be a great Spiderman and Peter Parker, and Emma Stone is a really good romantic lead, which was enough for me. When the first trailers for TASM2 came out, they weren't what I expected. I was a bit worried seeing the mixed reviews it was getting, but seeing the movies, I can say that I enjoyed the movie like the first one, despite its flaws.<br/><br/>The characters and acting were great as usual. Garfield nails it as spidey once again and Stone also hits the mark as Gwen Stacy. Dane Dehaan is a good Harry Osborne, and everyone else is pretty believable (except Electro, Jamie Foxx is pretty over the top). The romance is surprisingly good. I found myself really wanting them to stay together, being a non-romance guy.<br/><br/>The story, while with its really great moments, but is really messy. I think a ton of people who know Gwen's going to die, and the scene where she dies is still pretty sad (it made me tear up as much as uncle ben's death) despite me knowing that she would die. The mourning scene after was also good, but the last 10 minutes was unnecessary. Keep in mind that Rhino still hasn't shown up, so when he shows up, he gets less screen time than venom in spidey 3 (yes, he gets less on screen time than venom on spiderman 3. That's really sad). <br/><br/>CGI has been polished enough to the point where it doesn't look like a video game, which is good enough for me. The soundtrack, unfortunately, is really distracting. Blaring dubstep is throughout the movie and is pretty distracting, but I can get past it.<br/><br/>Even with its flaws, I still really like the movie. I can see why some people might not like this due to it being really crammed, but I really enjoyed it. It's worth a rental at least."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","6","3 May 2014"," A noisy action picture with a lot of problems, but with a central relationship that you actually care about.
","Of all the problems that plague Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 – and there are many – possibly the most curious is that he is haunted by the ghost of Denis Leary. That alone would bring any superhero to his knees. If you have seen the original 2012 adventure The Amazing Spider-Man then you're already up to speed on why he's being visited by the spirit of the beloved comedian. Surprisingly, it's far from his only issue.<br/><br/>In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter finds himself with enough personal problems to fill a year's worth of therapy. Dealing with three supervillains, college, family history, a nagging aunt, a super-fan, girlfriend problems, and a night job that's killing him, Peter probably faces more in two hours then any superhero should be asked to. That's part of what makes this sequel work. It's less about the posturing of villains and more about the business of being Spider-Man.<br/><br/>As the sequel opens, we find Peter taking care of business, dressed in the red and blue, taking down New York City's criminal element. He seems to enjoy his work. He's happy to throw off a one-liner while clinging to the side of a runaway semi, yet he goes home and finds himself nursing bruises and an endless series of tattered Spidey uniforms. He also finds himself having to dodge explaining his alter ego to his Aunt May (Sally Field) who regularly puts her foot down when the kid gets out of line.<br/><br/>The business of being Spider-Man is not all that ails him. If we complain that superhero movies these days come up short on story, this movie bears the weight of at least 12 different plots all jockeying for position. Not the least of which are the villains. The bad guys in Spider-Man's world have always been bombastic, and over-the-top, so throwing three into the mix is a little jarring.<br/><br/>First is Electro, played by an oddly-cast Jamie Foxx. He is introduced as Max Dillon, a nerdy Spider-Man superfan who becomes the lightening-spewing Electro after an accident involving electric eels (yes . . . electric eels). Foxx does an okay job as Electro, but the actor's abundant charisma makes him the wrong choice to play a put-upon nebbish. When he becomes the superhero Electro, Foxx looks just plain weird, like a cross between Dr. Manhattan and Emperor Palpatine. You're not suppose to ask how this transformation fixes the gap in his two front teeth, so I won't either.<br/><br/>Second is The Green Goblin, otherwise known as Harry Osbourne (Dane DeHaan), son of the Howard Hughes-like millionaire Norman Osbourne (Chris Cooper) who gives his son the massive responsibility of running Oscorp, a mega research corporation which – based on its role in this film and the previous one – seems to function mainly as an outlet to produce super villains. Previously it helped spawn The Lizard; here it spawns not only Electro but also The Green Goblin. Maybe someone ought to look into this.<br/><br/>Actually Harry's story is quite sad. He's a lonely kid who gets some news from the old man that isn't exactly positive, to say nothing of the fact that he doesn't seem to have any real associates or friends. Harry is an old schoolmate of Peter, but we can sense the uneasy union of two people who know each other but were never exactly friends. That may be his lot in life; Harry is a sad kid whose familial bloodline becomes a death sentence.<br/><br/>Rounding out the villains is a creepy Russian thug called Aleksei Sytsevich who later goes by the moniker Rhino. He shows up so late in the film that he might as well have been a cookie for Part 3 – maybe that was the point.<br/><br/>The villains are more or less perfunctory. The best parts of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are the moments that are quiet and intimate. Yes, this is a crash-and-bash action picture but you can feel director Marc Webb trying to tell a story under all the cacophony (this legitimately is a sequel). You can also feel that he'd rather tell a love story than make an action movie, but he has a lot to work with. He has so many balls in the air at once that you can actually feel the screenplay struggling to sort them out. At one point, Peter and Gwen hide in a closet and discuss Electro, Green Goblin and their own strained love story in one sitting as if they themselves are getting confused.<br/><br/>The real heart of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 – and its predecessor – is the love story. Peter continues his courtship of Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) which never feels forced, but is brought to life through a heart-felt and well written relationship that is tarnished, not by Peter's alter ego but by Gwen post-college plans. They have some moments together that are pure and sweet and even poignant once you know where the story is headed. Webb and his screenwriters have (in both films) written a love story that feels so genuine and heartfelt that the third act of this movie actually means something.<br/><br/>It is clear that Webb wants to pull the movie out of the doldrums of just being an expensive special effects exercise. The movie isn't as surprising or as refreshing as the original. It doesn't have the straight-lined narrative of the first movie, but it is interested in its superhero beyond just having him swing around and beat up villains. There's a heart beating just beneath this elephantine enterprise – despite its machine-made title. That may turn off those who are just looking for a disposable entertainment. This is a noisy action picture with a lot of problems, but with a central relationship that you actually care about."
"bparekh12","7","2","6","3 May 2014"," As a guy whose favourite superhero film is Spiderman 2, TASM 2 is really a big disappointment. But if you went in with very few expectations, you might as well like it.
","Good things first:<br/><br/>The musical grid beatdown between Spidey and Electro was certainly cool, so was every scene that featured Rhino, especially when Spidey juggles with the explosives (Sadly, only a mere 2 minutes). In the beginning when Spidey is swinging and doing his thing, we get this one camera angle which seems to be the POV of his balls. I wonder where they put the camera. Also, all the scenes where Spidey interacts with the NYC's residents, were awesome!<br/><br/>Now the bad things:<br/><br/>Too many sub-plot spoiled the movie. The sub-plots take a lot of time and don't really offer anything new. The main plot takes its toll because of that. Electro and Harry both turn into villains for apparently no real reason. Electro's digital VFX looked awkward in a film that's basically shot on film. Marc Webb, get back the Red Epic already! The movie switched genres often and that made it hard to follow. it didn't make it feel like a whole film but rather a compilation of scenes.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer really got it all wrong in this one. Playing TDKR in the opening plane scene and then playing the General Zod dubstep for Electro. Look we respect you and all and also you scored the awesome track of Inception, but really you can't use the same thing in all your movies.<br/><br/>The cinematography was very contrasting. The swinging and aerial shots were awesome! But the action scenes had way too much flashing of lights and shaky cam, (which really is being overused nowadays).<br/><br/>Verdict : As a guy whose favourite superhero film is Spiderman 2, TASM 2 is really a big disappointment. But if you went in with very few expectations, you might as well like it."
"david_bado27","8","2","6","3 May 2014"," It's entertaining , worth seeing.
","First , i want to say that this movie is really entertaining and exciting. The sound is awesome . There are also some funny scene which make everybody in the theatre laugh. Despite that , the problem here is it contains too many supervillains. And that leads to this result, there's no balance among the villains : The Electrode , Harry, and The Rhino. After seeing Amazing Spiderman 2 , i can conclude that , the main battle was between Spiderman and Electrode, Harry was so weak. It was just like the film didn't have enough time for the fight between Peter and Harry . If there had been nothing happened to Gwen , i could have said that Harry's appearance would crash the film. How about Rhino ? He just appeared in the final scene , what we had seen in the trailer was all the things he could do. Finally , i think you should go to the cinema and pay money for Amazing Spiderman 2 , it's a fantastic movie for you this May"
"quincytheodore","7","2","6","2 May 2014"," Its simple premise of one overcoming their crisis is emotionally captivating, effectively presented and thoroughly entertaining.
","Swinging with high voltage visual effects and fantastic soundtracks, The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise of Electro perches above its peers. In a more video game or comic inspired illustration, the overall colorful tone works wonderfully, especially in larger scales fights such as in Times Square, it's baffling not many movies do battles in the famous location. Its multitude of talents does a great job in bringing the characters to life; chemistry between them is definitely present. Regardless of some flaws, narrative might get crowded sewing numerous plots and villains, the movie will most likely satisfy fans and casual viewers alike.<br/><br/>The story tells origins of Electro and Green Goblin, played by Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan respectively, both of which have awkward relationship with the titular hero. Their stories are a bit foreshadowing, even more so to those who have knowledge of the comic or seen the previous trilogy and this might just be too predictable for some. Nevertheless the movie does a decent job on modernizing the villains and keeping them grounded without being too comical, it's a good choice not to put Electro in green yellow spandex. Jamie Foxx certainly has charisma for the main villain, although the fanatic aspect of the character in early parts is odd. It's a bit silly and too old-fashioned for an origin tale, he then becomes more appropriately menacing later on, partly due the blue CG face.<br/><br/>Dane DeHaan is a suitable cast for Harry Osborn, I daresay even better than James Franco who previously donned the green cape. He's an eerie reminiscence of young Leonardo DiCaprio, even with similar hairdo. He takes the role of Harry into a darker more obsessed persona, one with volatile and conniving nature. Most of the movie is oriented in Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) as they struggle with emotion and passion. Both of them showcase personal touches; it's apparent that Garfield admirably tries to fill the protagonist role. Spider-Man is a closer more relatable superhero as he endures doubt, guilt, and even the things ordinary folks go through daily, Garfield plays to this strength pretty well. Props to Sally Field and Chris Cooper as parental figures, each the polar opposite of the other, complementing the hero and villain, respectively.<br/><br/>Graphic differs from the usual gritty mainstream superhero flicks, New York is displayed in all its vibrant wonder. At first, it seems a tad close to video game, but I fancy the distinct feel. When the movie talks about hope aplenty, it helps to view the world in radiance. Action is great, often taking camera angles close to Spider-Man, slowing down just barely at the moment of impact. The use of audio matches pretty well, Hans Zimmer is a master in this regard. Many techno dubstep tracks focused on Electro blazing in the background and electrically pumping adrenaline, it may appear ludicrous at first, but it fits the movie brilliantly. Pop and rock songs litter the movie, played just in the right time. The production value is aggressive and undeniably entertaining.<br/><br/>The story sadly may stutter throughout the movie, there are just too many angles to show. From the romance between the two, origins of villains, the lingering past, the pace sometimes take too long on certain element and not enough on some. Not to mention the transition can be cumbersome, it doesn't help that the usual coincidence and practical cliché plots still persist. The flaws are there, yet its entire cast and production value overshadow them. Its simple premise of one overcoming their crisis is emotionally captivating, effectively presented and thoroughly entertaining."
"stevendbeard","8","2","6","2 May 2014"," An Amazing Sequel
","I saw ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", starring Andrew Garfield-The Social Network, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus; Emma Stone-Gangster Squad, The House Bunny; Jamie Foxx-Django Unchained, Law Abiding Citizen; Dane DeHaan-Metallica Through the Never, Lincoln and Sally Field-Lincoln, Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>This is an amazing second installment to the new Spider-Man trilogy-the third one is in the works. The Spider-Man character is now more like the comic books, both in storyline and just the fun one-liners that he zings at whoever is within listening distance, as he does his crime fighting or life saving duties. Andrew returns as Spidey and Emma is Gwen-FYI: the two actors started dating in real life and I think it makes their relationship look more realistic on screen. Sally also returns as Aunt May. Newcomers include Jamie as Electro, the main villain, and Dane as Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn. There is more story here , rather than just the big fights and explosions that are usual in these movies- although there are plenty of those, too. You get some back story on why Andrew's parents had to leave him with Sally during the first film. There are two major villains and one minor one-he has about 5 minutes of screen time-that are used in this film but there are a few subtle hints of future characters in the next movie. Some are character names, like Alister Smythe and Felicia Hardy-hint, hint-and some are glimpses of their costumes that are hanging in secluded labs. I know some comic book purists might get angry with the portrayal of certain things-Electro doesn't look like that, etc.-but they have sort of merged things from the regular Marvel Universe with the Marvel Ultimates-the same way they did it with Nick Fury now being a black man-so I wish they would quit gripping until they have at least seen the movie-then, they can gripe all they want. As far as the effects go, they are very good. When Spider-Man is swinging through the city, you might get a little dizzy if you are afraid of heights. I saw it in IMAX 3D and it looked great. There is a scene right after the end credits start that is basically an advertisement for the next X-Men movie-due in a couple of weeks-but no scene at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 22 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"ketgup83","6","2","6","2 May 2014"," Golden opportunity gone wasted. This Sequel could have been better.
","When the Spider man series was re-booted in 2012, I was wondering - Will it survive ? Does it even require a reboot since last Spider man film released 5 years back only. Why do not they just continue with the same star cast and take it forward. I guess I was right !!!<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman 2 continues the story of Peter Parkar and his battle petite against highly lethal enemies like Electro and The Green Goblin incepted out of the Oscorp company and the truth behind his father's sudden disappearance.<br/><br/>I was slightly disappointed with The Amazing Spiderman as it was dark and shady on contrary to the comical version of Sam Raimi's. Fortunately, I was pumped up to see the sequel thanks to extraordinary and catchy trailer. The movie begins with Spider man fighting the goons with satirical humor embedded which was passable. As the movie progresses, the director loses the focus of the story and includes the romantic track which hinders the movement. The film picks up the steam as we watch the epic battle between ELECTRO and SPIDERMAN which was well executed with eye-catching CGI. The editing is really weak and the screenplay is a roller coaster ride. Though the 1st half is plain, second half gathers some momentum especially the climax fight scene which was well-executed and something to look out for. Cinematography is splendid with superb art direction. Dialogues are fine. Though the story is pretty weak, it is CGI which is highly driven and mesmerizing. Andrew Garfield does fine as Peter Parkar but still I would love to see Tobey Maguire reprising the role which made him famous. Emma Stone was not in form. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan were good in their respective roles. <br/><br/>Overall, The Amazing Spiderman 2 could have better. Opportunity gone wasted. 2.75/5 Above Average<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk"
"chazisalmostgod","1","7","37","9 June 2014"," Pretty much a dud, sadly
","After seeing the first movie of the rebooted franchise, I had such high hopes for the sequel. Instead, what we received was an angst-ridden mess that I've pretty much come to expect from the franchise.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I guess what bothered me the most, was the whiny angst of Peter Parker when he was pushing Gwen Stacy away through the first hour and a half of the movie. Ridiculous amounts of guilt and suffering because he promised her father that he would break up with her. Never mind that he'd apparently already gotten over it by the end of the previous movie. Here, we have endless scenes of her father staring at him with imagined accusatory eyes. Corny as hell.<br/><br/>Next, the writers and director pick the one thing in the Spider-Man mythology to include, even though they pretty much ignored dozens upon dozens of other equally important plot points: the death of Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>I'd have bought her dying if it had advanced the plot/storyline is any real way. Sadly, it did not. Instead, it was a way to get a cheap tear out of saps foolish not to see the puppet strings of the movie. Now you have to understand that I'm a pretty sensitive guy. I shed a tear or two during The Secret Life of Bees, one hell of a movie.<br/><br/>Here, I was jeering the entire time, cursing Spider-Man for being too much of a wimp to stop Harry Osborn from killing Gwen Stacy. I kept thinking in my head that if it were my girl who was being threatened, and I had the proportional strength and speed of a spider, I'd twist the guy doing the threatening head's off like opening a bottle of beer. Tough stuff that he's my friend. Friends don't threaten your girl.<br/><br/>Anyway, the end annoyed me off almost as much the two proceeding points. Of course, Harry is still alive, Peter being too ""moral"" to do anything to the murderer of his love. Manages to unleash threat upon the city to try to bring back Spider-Man who has disappeared. Yeah, that's new. Little kid stands in front of armored suit shooting machine guns everywhere. Complete idiot. I was cheering for the bad guy to shoot the kid. Darwinism at its finest. Sadly, Peter decides to become Spider-Man again because... who knows. Silly sentimentality.<br/><br/>Movie's a mess. Regretted the money spent seeing it. That's on me. Don't waste your time on this garbage. Go see something by Marvel, who actually knows how to write a superhero movie. Their Marvelverse stuff is amazing (minus Iron Man 3)."
"divineezeagwu","8","1","2","10 June 2020"," THE Amazing...
","After so much controversy and criticism pertaining to this particular film, I decided to give it a rewatch and I can definitely reassure Spider-Man fans that, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't awful, but flawed...<br/><br/>To avoid any spoilers, I will just state the biggest argument of this film, which is that: ""It had a lot going on"". The reason for that though was due to Sony's plans to set up a Live Action Spider-Man Universe. So The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was the one film of the series that essentially had to get sacrificed with too much being in it in order to kickstart their future film plans, which was: Sinister Six, The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom, etc.<br/><br/>PS: I really recommend that before you watch this movie, that you also watch videos critically reviewing it, because after the movie is completed, you'll be shocked as to how far off most of those reviews are. A lot of them nitpick every aspect of the movie that rubbed particularly them the wrong way... You really begin to appreciate the Marc Webb, Andrew Garfield films much more compared to the current team."
"JC_Ride","3","1","2","20 May 2020"," The Amazing Catastrophe!
","I could tell I wouldn't like this movie from the fact that it opened up with a bad plane fight scene invloning Peter's parents. Other than that however, the movie starts out strong! The opening montage is probably the best stuff this movie has to offer, we get introduced to our villain and we see spidey in his best with his new (gorgeous) suit. Annd then it all goes downhill.<br/><br/>Where to start with this! One of the main problems this movie has is it's got waaay too many plot points! Electro becomes a villain and attacks the city, Spiderman needs to work out his relationship, Harry wants to cure himself, Peter wants to find out about his parents, Captain Stacey haunts Peter, Aunt May wants to be a nurse and Uncle Bens killer is still on the loose! Though you wont have to worry about that last part cause THEY DON'T ADRESS IT. The reason Peter put on the mask initially in the first movie was to find his unlces killer. And he never does! In either movie! Did they flat out forget about it?<br/><br/>Other than that Electro is laughable. He falls into a tank of eels, ofcource that fixes his tooth gap and gives him powers aaand now he doesn't view Spiderman as a friend anymore and he suddenly decides that *yeah I'm gonna be a god*. Seriously? Plus his design is awful. Rhyno is a joke it's best to pretend he's not even in this. And Harry... where to begin with Harry? First of all, the performances here are fine, and the cast is great but Harry is so badly acted for some reason. It's hard to watch at times. Also his whole arc makes zero sense. His father tells him he must find a cure for the plot diseas.. oh excuse me the Osborn disease or he'll die like him. Ok.. doesn't he have like at least 30 years? The guy is in his early 20s and his father is like in his 50s if not 60s. Why is he in such a rush? Also when he asks for Spidermans blood, why would Spiderman decline? He's supposedly gonna die very soon anyways! Yes your blood might kill him, but not giving him your blood WILL MOST CERTAINLY kill him! Also I love how Harry approaches Peter cause *he takes pictures of Spiderman so he must know him*. Harry that's not how photography works!<br/><br/>On another note, we have Peter making fun of every situation. I know he makes jokes in the comics, but he doesn't sacrifice human lives so that he can make the jokes! And don't get me started on his parents! When I saw Peter accidentally breaking a calculator only for it to reveal coins that he used on an abandoned subway station that revealed a secret wagon-lab where his father had arranged some expository dialogue for him... I think I lost a few IQ points that I will never take back. The romance is also incredibly annoying. And even worse than Electro is the Goblin who looks like a crack addict and who Spiderman doesn't even take seriously. The ONLY reason he's in this is so they can remake Gwens death for cheap fan service.<br/><br/>But what bothers me THE MOST is that Peter being Spiderman has almost NO impact on his life. Yes Gwen dies because he's not willing to let her go in order to protect her, but it's not like he didn't have a thing with her. Other than that he's great! No money problems, no not being able to pay the rent, no failing classes, no impact whatsoever! The conflict between Peter and Spiderman is pivotal to every Spiderman story, and here it's almost non existent!<br/><br/>The ok things about this movie are some nice fight scenes, some ok acting and some decent cinematography. Also not gonna lie the cgi is spot on. On every other department it fails, miserably! It's like the looked at everything that made Spiderman 3 bad and said *let's do that but even worse this time round!*. Worst Spiderman movie and it's not even close. 2.5/10."
"fernandoschiavi","7","1","2","10 April 2020"," Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film
","Despite some criticisms, the previous film received several positive reviews, in addition to a good result at the box office worldwide, thus guaranteeing a sequel. Again directed by Marc Webb and scripted by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt based on the characters created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, we see the return of Andrew Garfield as our hero, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, as well as Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Paul Giamatti in the roles of the main antagonists.<br/><br/>In this sequence, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) loves to be Spider-Man, even though being the arachnid hero puts him in very complicated situations, especially with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and aunt May (Sally Field). Despite this, he balances his various facets as well as he can. At the moment, Peter is more concerned with the ghost of the promise made to Gwen's father, that he would walk away from her to protect her. At the same time he has to deal with the return of an old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), and the emergence of a powerful villain: Electro (Jamie Foxx).<br/><br/>""Spectacular Spider-Man 2"" continues several plots presented in the previous film, showing Peter who remains Spider-Man and helping to save New York City and who also works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle. In love, he continued the relationship with Gwen Stacy, but he lives tormented by the promise made to the father of his love, which ends up wanting to cause a series of conflicts in the relationship and distancing him from Gwen even with the two loving each other. This plot is interesting and makes the relationship evolve, bringing new questions, such as the proposal for Gwen - who continues to work at Oscorp Industries - to study in Oxford, England amid the separation of the couple, which leads them to question whether they should or not to follow different paths in life. Would the couple's love be enough to forget past promises and move on, respecting each other's choice? Once again the chemistry of the couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone - who at the time were also a couple in real life - is genuine and engaging. The pair of great actors manage to pass all the complicity and love to overcome the barriers in their relationship. They understand each other in looks, in conversations, in small teasing with each other. By the way, Gwen has a much greater importance than it already had in the previous feature.<br/><br/>The character Mary Jane Watson would have a small appearance in this film and would certainly assume the role of Peter's love interest in an eventual conclusion of this second trilogy of the character, especially after the events of the last act of this second part. Mary Jane would be played by Shailene Woodley, who even filmed some scenes like the character in the film, however, months before the premiere, it was announced that Mary Jane was cut from the film. Director Marc Webb later said the cut was ""a creative decision to simplify the story and focus only on Peter and Gwen and their relationship"".
Another plot that has new developments is the past of Peter's parents and how he continues to influence the hero in his decisions. The script shows us more of what happened to the parents just before the plane crash that killed them, the connection between Peter's father, Richard Parker, with Norman Osborne and why he had to abandon his son in the care of his uncles Ben and May, as much as they didn't want to. Finally, Peter - and the audience, of course - has many of the answers to the mysteries he has always sought to unravel since he was a child. Her relationship with Aunt May (Sally Field) is also more interesting, with her aunt wanting to protect the boy from the events of the past concerning Peter's parents, whom she believes to be the truth about what had happened. This unbridled desire for Peter to know the truth about his parents' past also causes jealousy in May, who does not want to see his boy suffer.<br/><br/>However, the way of approaching the villains was once again the major narrative problem. Even though he has been on the production team since the first trilogy led by Sam Raimi, it seems that Avi Arad and Kevin Feige did not learn much from the initial trilogy. Again, the producers and director Marc Webb try to put several villains and interconnect them in a single story, but just as in ""Spider-Man 3"" - which brought together Areia Sand, the new Green Goblin and Venom - the script does not convince and tries to get just an excuse to join the greatest number of threats possible in a single film, without developing any of the characters.<br/><br/>Theoretically being the main villain of the film - which even gives the film its name - Max Dillon (Electro does not pass the image of a great threat until near the end. Played by Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, the character is presented as a brilliant scientist, who developed a plant alone for Oscorp, but who is a rejected person, without friends and who has always been invisible to everyone and who puts on a pedestal anyone who gives him a little more attention or who makes him feel special. Living like that alone made him an extremely unstable person. The point is that Electro's motivations are not credible. The fact that Spider-Man paying attention to him has already made him venerate the hero, even when the Spider doesn't recognize him anymore transformed after the genetic alteration he had suffered after the accident at Oscorp, it is enough for him to become his enemy. Not to mention that he is easily defeated in the fight in the middle of Times S quare and only reappears in the final act when allying with another character.<br/><br/>Harry Osborne appears after studying at a boarding school at the age of 11. Rejected by his father and destined to suffer from the same genetic inheritance as his family, the heir of Oscorp Industries returns to see his father Norman (Chris Cooper) practically on his deathbed and starts trying to get the blood of Spider-Man, who could use to search for a cure for your degenerative disease and save your own life. Harry is presented as arrogant, ambitious and doubtful. His father's abandonment and rejection shaped that boy into what he became. Peter's old childhood friend and having helped him when the boy had lost his parents in the past, the two meet again and resume the friendship relationship. The two support each other, as they consider themselves as two rejected, abandoned by their parents. This relationship could have been much better developed, but Harry's vindictive attitudes occur extremely quickly, as well as his transformation into the Green Goblin - with a much better look than that presented in the first trilogy. The villain appears out of nowhere, attacks the hero out of nowhere, loses easily and then disappears, to resurface in the end allied to the mysterious Mr. Fear, in another moment of pure confusion. Despite the good performance of Dane DeHaan, the abrupt form of changes that occurred with the character, are negative points. DeHaan's Green Goblin would deserve an entire film as the main character, so that it could be fully explored.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, they still managed to fit in a third villain, Rino (Paul Giamatti), who appears in the first and last scene of the film. The great visual surprise of the film has mere seconds to show its best shape. The character only served to show the audience fans of the comics, what the villain's look would be like in real life. Giamatti, who is an excellent actor, does not have any space to develop the villain.<br/><br/>The director Marc Webb bets again on the direction of actors and proved to be competent again both in the action scenes with his camera always very well positioned to bring the best angle to the audience, especially when she passes for the heroes of the arachnid. Despite very well constructed scenes, the feeling we have is that more impactful scenes were lacking. Highlight for the fight sequence between Electro and Spider-Man in Times Square - the electrocuted handrail with the highlight - and the entire final sequence at the Oscorp plant between Spider-Man and the two villains. As in the previous film, the visual effects are incredible. We can also notice a greater number of comedy scenes. In addition to the chemistry with Emma Stone, Garfield is even more comfortable with the character. The Spider looks like he's out of the comics. The attitudes of the Friend of the Neighborhood are perfect. In the fight against villains we have the playful Spider, practically dancing with the enemies.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was composed this time by Hans Zimmer, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. Marc Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and Eurythmics, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart did not participate in the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (in reference to the Sinister Sextet) helped Zimmer in the compositions.<br/><br/>However, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is again a lesser adventure than it could be. It lacked the old lesson of ""less is more"" to guarantee a feature film in its total efficiency and with fewer questions that invalidate its potential. In the face of this gigantism and the poor choice in the subplots to be addressed, The Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is stuck for much of its narrative. The film only thrills once and for all in the beginning and also in the final stretch, when it gains apotheotic airs. It's time for the special effects show, the exciting battles and a good dose of courage, to the delight of those who know the story of the arachnid hero in the comics. Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film."

Great seeing Sally Field again, she stole this boys heart in 1977 and is as beautiful as ever. Finally, this review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the new Rhino (Paul Giamatti).

"bjoernidler","8","1","2","20 November 2018"," Great chemistry
","I really like this film. And not for the obvious reasons, the action, the fx, the humour...
I liked it for allowing a relationship that actually feels genuine. My favourite scenes are the ones where Andrew Garfield interacts with Emma Stone and/or Dane de Hahn. In these scenes the director Webb proves that he's great at portraying twenty-somethings.
The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is real and that comes across nicely. I actually cared for them and wanted them to be together. Not to spoil anything, but in the end I couldn't help but cry. Not having read the comic books and steering clear of certain online platforms, I didn't know what would happen and was shocked. All those deaths at the end of Infinity War didn't mean that much to me because I don't have any emotional connection to most of them. This was different.<br/><br/>Finally, in my humble opinion, Andrew Garfield is the best actor having played Spiderman. Toby Maguire was likeable, sure. But there were scenes where he 'acted' too much. With Garfield it all feels more natural. Tom Holland is fun. But that's it.<br/><br/>So come for the fun, come for the action. Stay for the characters and their chemistry."

","All spiderman movies are better and best except this movie because it has too much villan which do not entertain me."
"invisibleunicornninja","1","1","2","16 August 2018"," And I thought that the first movie was bad....
","Before I continue this review, I just want to warn anyone with photosensitive epilepsy not to watch this movie. Honestly, no-one should watch this movie, but there is a long sequence in this move where the screen flashes colors rapidly. I'm not even someone who is easily bothered by flashing lights, and that sequence hurt my eyes. <br/><br/>Plot - This movie is really boring. Honestly I was hoping that it would be so stupid that it becomes funny (like the first movie) but at no point does it get to that level of ridiculousness. There are several pointless subplots (like the romance) that only seem to be in this movie to waste time. The only scenes that I kind of liked were a few of the scenes with Spider-Man, but even then they were kind of dumb. I'm glad that this franchise ended. Every other version of Spider-Man that I've seen so far is so much better in nearly every way. I know a lot of people didn't like ""Spider-Man 3"" but at least that movie had believable effects and a coherent story.<br/><br/>Effects - This movie has pretty terrible effects. Electro never reaches the same level of goofiness as The Lizard, but he's still bad. Unfortunately, all the bad acting, action, and effects in this movie end up just being really dull as opposed to funny. Again, the action is really bad. I'm pretty sure that nearly everything in the fights is CG and it looks really bad. <br/><br/>Acting - Like I said, most of the acting is pretty bad. I don't know if its the bad script, the bad direction, or if no-one cared. Probably all three. No-one in this movie gives a convincing performance.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is the worst thing that a movie can be - boring. I'll give the first movie credit, it had me laughing. It was at the movie's stupidity, but at least the first movie was creative in how dumb it got. This sequel is just poorly made, cliched crap. <br/><br/>Also, and I'm not even making this up, this movie put my little brother to sleep. He was fast asleep on the couch about an hour into it. That is how boring it is."

Jamie Foxx was also good as Electro, and the guy playing Harry Osborne/Green Goblin was good too. This was as good as sequels go, and fantastic as far as superhero flicks go. You will definitely feel for Peter's character throughout, and Harry Osborne's villain was good. One other thing-a coherent story!<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","This Movie Gets a lot of hate and frankly i don""t think it deserves it. There are some problems with it though. The Character of Electro was very poorly written and his motivations were very weak. He didn't really feel like a character and felt more like someone for Spider man to fight. Some of the Special Effects were not very convincing. The shots of Spider Man Swinging looked like they were pulled out of a video game. And there was just too many subplots and too many characters in the movie. However the action Scenes were quite exciting, the emotional scenes were touching and some of the characters were very compelling. Harry Osborn is a very strong character and you really feel His pain throughout the movie. The relationship Between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy was very well done. And this is an entertaining movie. Most of the Characters are likable and the pacing is good. Its not a masterpiece but its a fun ride. I'd say check it out. Just Don't expect it to be as good as something like The Dark Knight."

The main actors spiderman(peter) and gwen were fantastic. They were much better in expressing emotions than in the other series.

"danielloe","8","1","2","8 June 2015"," Very underrated
","*WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS* I was one of the rare few who found the first Amazing Spider-man movie to be really good, so I was definitely looking forward to asm 2. I wasn't disappointed. This did what a good 2 movie should do, it gave us a really good villain. Electro was a great villain, who was very menacing. Harry Osborn was another great villain, and he had a clearly explored back story and motivation. Combine the two and you get the perfect villain. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are still in-arguably great as the leads, and their chemistry together is top-notch. The effects are even better this time around (which is really saying something), and these are possibly the best effects I've ever seen. This movie keeps a great tone, in that it has some funny moments, but it knows when to be serious, and that's the tone I want from a Spider-man movie. I'm still not 100 percent sure how I feel about Gwen's death. It made a nice conclusion to the series, but if they had wanted to make more, they would've needed Gwen alive. There are a few too many plot-lines, and that's why I rate this a bit under the first movie, but I still give the story a thumbs-up. In conclusion, I think this movie was really good, with great characters, perfect visual effects, a good story, that occasionally got too muddled, and a good tone. I was really sad to hear that this great series was getting thrown out to make way for another bland MCU movie with forced humor and no tension. This could've been one of my top five favorite trilogies of all time, now it'll be my favorite double-feature. This was a great send off to a great series."

","I really like this spider man, he is much better than the goofy toby mcdonalds. He feels real somehow and i really like Gwen in it, she is full of sparks and a girl any man would fight for.<br/><br/>The antagonists on the other are trash. They lack deep, and when u look at them all you can think of are lost kids stuck in puberty with no strong character whatsoever. You want a supervillain to be strong minded with purpose and real hate pulsing through their veins, not this. They are simpleminded and all you do is pity them.<br/><br/>Real hate doesn't just pop up one day all of a sudden. There is no sense of evil around, just deluded fools with no psyciatrist to help them walk with both legs.<br/><br/>I still liked the movie despite the the trash antagonists. Peter parker meeting up in his past was awsomely done. Also his affection to Gwen and the struggle in his heart due to the past felt real.<br/><br/>the only thing bad was the supervillains..they are on same level as jar jar binks. clowns to get younger people be able buy a cinema ticket."

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (released with the subtitle Rise of Electro in some markets)[6] is a 2014 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, directed by Marc Webb and released by Columbia Pictures. It is the fifth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, and serves as a sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man (2012).<br/><br/>Confident in his powers as Spider-Man, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) embraces his new role as a hero and spends time with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in between protecting New York from criminals. However, his greatest battle yet is about to begin. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront an enemy far more powerful than he is. And when his old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns, Peter comes to realize that all his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp."

","I gave it a 9 out of 10 because I'm pretty much a marvel fanboy who doesn't know any better. Plus I saw it in 3D which made it SO much better! My review won't be biased in that sense however.<br/><br/>Spiderman is a story/universe that has SO much going on in it... apparently Sony and Marvel know that but don't know how to deal with it. They couldn't make up their minds on what to include in the movie. Love story between Gwen and Spiderman? Sorrowful absent father story between Peter and his dad? Beginning intro for the sinister six story line? An ""I feel bad for you"" story between the Osbornes? ANOTHER ""I feel bad for you"" story with Aunt May and Peter?? It even ended in a way that had the studios probably telling the director to cut it because it could've easily gone on infinitely...<br/><br/>It did have its good points... just the visuals were amazing. I got chills seeing Electro do his thing and hearing the menacing dubstep music every time he appeared. But again, there was just too much... SO MANY things could have been left out of the movie.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not a fan of Andrew Garfield. He's a good actor but just doesn't do it for me as a Peter Parker/Spiderman.<br/><br/>I'll still leave a 9 stars for my own grading but for anyone else that reads this, for an overall movie grade, I give this more of a 6 or 7."

","What can I say except Wow. This film had me sitting on the edge the whole way through. I don't usually write these but I thought I just had to get across what an amazing film this is. I was a bit sceptical at first because of how perfectly Toby Maguire executed his role as Spider-Man. At first it seemed to put me off how cocky spider-man was but it seemed to grow on me. I feel that Jamie foxx an unlikely actor to be a villain in spider-man absolutely stormed it. He played his role absolutely effortlessly. The special effects with his character electro had got to be the best to date I really think it made the film something special. I am rather quite saddened that I didn't pay much attention to this film and didn't get to watch it until now and in the cinema because I think that would have been absolutely incredible. I never got to watch the amazing spider-man 1 but if it is anything like this one it has to be incredible . I can't wait for number 3 to come out I will surely be the first to go and get my ticket. This is a film you have to watch."
"g-bodyl","8","1","2","26 March 2015"," Spidey Is Back!
","I still have split feelings over the new Spiderman reboots. I loved the original trilogy, but I did like the first reboot even though it was the same origin story all over again. If I wanted a sequel, it would have been Spider-Man 4, but instead we get the Amazing Spider-Man 2. I won't lie when I say that I expected a complete disaster. I actually....liked this film even more so than the first one. It has plenty of strong action and I actually liked the romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy this time around. The biggest fault I found with the movie is the overuse of villains. Sure, the Rhino is a good character, but save him for the next film! <br/><br/>Marc Webb's returns Spider-Man/Peter Parker to the big screen as he and Stacy are graduating from high school. Peace in the city isn't to last as Oscorp plans on taking over the city. Peter has to face such villains as Electro and Rhino as well as balance the delicate duties of Spider-Man and Peter Parker.<br/><br/>I think Andrew Garfield makes for a very good Spider-Man. He is more cocky than Maguire's take on Spider-Man, but I find his character more likable. Speaking of likable, Emma Stone makes for a fine Gwen Stacy and she has great chemistry with Garfield. Jamie Foxx does well as Electro, although his role bears strong resemblance to his role in the Soloist. Paul Giamatti has a good few scenes as the Rhino and likewise Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborne.<br/><br/>Overall, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 is actually an entertaining superhero movie. It's not perfect of course since there are some flaws within the story, but I found the film to be just a tad better than the first reboot film. The action is there, the romance is there, and Spidey being a hero is of course there. The film also has a little bit of an surprising emotional charge. A good film to watch and better than I was led to believe.<br/><br/>My Grade: B+"
"fernie121793","5","1","2","7 December 2014"," It's a okay spidey movie
","I really did enjoyed this movie seen it a couple of times and still love it. Yes everyone is entitled to their opinions just as much as I do and here's mine. ""The Amazing Spider- Man 2"" was really entertaining and good but honestly my complaints is that there was an overload of characters and it felt too soon to add the rise and fall of the green goblin and death of Gwen Stacey which left me upset by the way but hey Gwen was infamous in the comic book world because of her death and mostly because of that and oh being Peter's first love. I also felt like the beginning of the movie of The Parkers was unnecessary it should've been shown in the last film and serve as a mystery throughout the movie and have Peter look for answers like he did and continue on in the sequel which he did but it just left me confused of what's already known but it wanted to be shown in this movie but felt it was unnecessary and had more questions than answers and Electro was a miss for me, Jamie Foxx was okay with what he can do but for Max Dillon it was hard for me to like him and feel bad for him because the character came off as a cliché for villains. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were just adorable are two stars had charm and wit along with emotion and yes the dialogue was either cringe worthy or sweet. The Rhino was a good laugh to some but I was annoyed with the stereotype : angry Russian thug. Sally Field as Aunt May was a highlight as well from a struggling woman making ends meet yet finding the time to care for her boy and Felicity Jones was just a miss and Felicia was also another unnecessary adjustment in the movie. Dane DeHaan was at his best giving all he as to show a rich boy dying and becoming evil but felt the whole green goblin was too soon and was alright with what he can do with the script. For the next Spider-Man movie listen to the criticism and don't repeat mistakes and stop with the overabundance. Overall it was a good movie and I love this movie very much."

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was one of the movies I was looking forward to the most in the beginning of summer 2014. When I saw it in theaters, I was blown away. Now that I own it and have had a chance to study it, I've come across some issues.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is weak in this movie compared to the first Amazing Spider-Man movie, where Garfield's Peter was excellent and Spidey not so much.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I want to like Andrew Garfield's portrayal because you can tell he genuinely loves Spider-Man and I'm happy that he gets to be Spider-Man, but this was weak. Hopefully future movies will allow him to fully express the Spidey persona.<br/><br/>Now, as for Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy, I couldn't care less for her. Sure, she helps Spider-Man here and there but eh. I could do without her.<br/><br/>The one character that redeemed this movie (in my opinion) was Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn. I CANNOT get enough of him and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him as Green Goblin. His portrayal is spot-on maniacal and dangerous, even though he wasn't in the movie for that long.<br/><br/>Another redeeming factor is the easter eggs and references here and there, like the notorious Daily Bugle editor...<br/><br/>This movie feels like a set-up rather than an actual movie. It's like a 2 hour-long preview of what's next to come and I honestly have no problem with that, except when it gets exhausting.<br/><br/>The plot is flawed, so are the motives of some characters and despite its great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, even I got tired of literally every scene having too much music in the background. Can't recall a quiet scene other than the closet one.<br/><br/>In the end, it's not as bad as people make it seem but it definitely has its issues."

","I love Spider-Man. I really love Spider-Man. He's my favourite superhero of all time. And to have him in a cluttered, passionless, boring, and anger inducing movie makes me depressed.<br/><br/>This movie is such a giant mess. Subplots are everywhere, villains are lazily written, the decision making in this movie is questionable, logic is thrown out the window, and I forgot that Peter Parker was supposed to be Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield may have done an okay job as Spider-Man, but he did a terrible job as Peter Parker. When I think of Peter Parker, the last thing I think of is a hipster with attractive looks and angsty emotions with a hot girlfriend. <br/><br/>Sure, the Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker romance comes off as genuine, but is it because the script is forcing us to see how much in love they are or is it because Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are dating?<br/><br/>Max Dillon. wut why how could they what even Electro, I mean, the Riddler, hates Spider-Man because he's an attention seeking whore.<br/><br/>Dane Dehaan was a great actor for a role like Harry Osborne. I loved his performance in Chronicle as an angsty teenager. However, in here, it felt heavily overacted. Whining, evil for some reason, killing people?<br/><br/>On a related note, the movie never explained the motives of the super villains. In every Spider-Man movie, they clearly explain what the plan was for them being evil or dominant. However, once they reach their goal, what happens next? When Harry and Electro team up, they want to kill Spider-Man, but they never explain why. They never explain what to do next. It's so cluttered.<br/><br/>This movie is just a cluttered mess. The movie jumps from subplots including Peter and Harry being friends, Max becoming Electro, Harry having a disease and being in charge of Oscorp, Peter and Gwen having a problem, Gwen going to college, Aunt May having a job, Rhino being there, Peter's parents and their disappearance, Harry turning into the Green Goblin, the death of a main character, and then two unrelated planes about to crash in the final battle.<br/><br/>There is no time to breathe. There is nothing of substance that is good form this movie. The action scenes are quick and don't mean anything. I know who is going to die. I know who is going to live. It's so boring. Everything is happening at once and I can't help but to not care.<br/><br/>If this review felt like a mess, this movie is worse.<br/><br/>And the worst thing is, everything, every single sub plot, every single cliffhanger left in this movie, every teaser and easter egg, is just build up for a sequel that will never happen. Again, why should I care about what's going on if it doesn't mean anything in the end? <br/><br/>As for a movie with nothing going on while everything is going on, this movie is just really really really not good. I detest this movie. It is personally the worst movie of all time."
"DarthVoorhees","2","5","24","5 September 2014"," Suffers from the cancer that is Kevin Feigeism...
","'Amazing Spider-Man 2' has some moments that work. I'll give it that. The problem is is that there is so much going on here. Marc Webb is juggling so many balls and it eventually comes to a point where they all fall on him. People are expecting bigger comic book films these days. The 'Amazing Spider Man 2' is nothing but a product placement for sequels that haven't been conceived yet. This is the cancer of the comic book film and it isn't likely to go away anytime soon. 'Amazing Spider-Man 2' just might be the worst example.<br/><br/>I think any criticism of this film will inevitably lead to criticism of pulp culture by it's self. Sequels have to be earned. There is such a thing as quality over quantity. Every conceivable wink at the camera or easter egg that could be fit in here is. The irony of this is that we aren't supposed to be able to notice these things. I don't care about seeing Doc Ock's tentacles on a wall. I want to be drawn into a story with characters and all this film can offer me are set pieces. <br/><br/>I will say that there is potential here in some ways and that's more than I can say about a few other comic book films. I think if Webb had chosen to focus on juggling one storyline and expanding it into a fully conceived picture than we could have had something here. The film just wants to do too much because it cares about setting up a sequel. The Green Goblin and Norman Osbourne take is original and I could conceivably see it making an interesting film. I actually like what they do with the character of Harry because he serves as a very personal and very similar antagonist to Spider-Man here. Both men live in the shadows of shady fathers and are inheriting their gifts/curses. This is a starting point for a movie. Likewise had the film chosen to only be about Electro I think it could have worked too. Jamie Foxx's initial awkwardness before he becomes evil is kind of touching. Had the film given Foxx more time to develop his descent into madness then I think he would have been more than capable of creating a memorable comic book villain. <br/><br/>The problem is because there is so much to cover here no storyline is fully developed. The characters all feel rushed and it is especially noticeable in their motivations. All the conflicts of the film feel so inorganic and as if they are there merely because it brings the loosely fitted pieces together. In the end it makes Spidey look arrogant. The inciting incident that sets Electro against Spider-Man is so ridiculous. Electro is attacked by the cops and he asks Spider-Man to talk him down. How is it to see Spider-Man so quickly and rashly get into a battle with him? It's just goofy and ruins any chance of me identifying with Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The love story of the film feels forced and kind of creepy to be frank. I think Emma Stone is perfectly serviceable as Gwen Stacy. In fact I think why I can save this film from a bomb rating is because Gwen Stacy has fire here and she repels against being merely Peter's property that Spider-Man has to save. When combined together though the two characters just seem completely phony. The dialogue between them shows the general uncomfortable nature of showing men and women together in these comic book films. You have a scene where Garfield's Peter Parker admits to following Stacy around and the film makers stage it as if it is cute. <br/><br/>There's passion here but it's passion for money. The film leaves the characters vague and almost air headed. The only time they come to life is when they remind us that 'Amazing Spider-Man 3' is coming."
"samandps3","10","3","12","1 May 2014"," This was a great film.
","Personally i really really really enjoyed this sequel. i thought it was superior to the first film in many ways. the story was better and the acting was phenomenal. the action was great too. but i feel 2 of the 3 villains were a bit rushed (Rhino and Green Goblin). They could have worked them in a bit more. But overall it was a great film with great action, great acting and a great story. it is really worth seeing. It is far far far superior than any of the Raimi films. I don't get why people like the older ones so much. Don't get me wrong i loved those ones but the reboots are way better. really good flick. worth the time and money."
"joebloggscity","7","3","12","19 April 2014"," Overlong but Spidey's Web still just hits the mark
","The second in this reboot series and for me possibly one of the better Spiderman movies. It's quite a long film with multiple arcs throughout. Our hero is struggling to juggle his options and wishes, with a loving girlfriend, family secrets and local hero status all fighting for his attention.<br/><br/>Andrew Hatfield is very good again as our tormented hero, and his fellow stars don't let him down.<br/><br/>We've a few villains and they are the best part of the film. Electro is well done by Jamie Fox, but it's our new man Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn who is the surprise with some great acting as the cornered dying young man.<br/><br/>The story though is a bit of a mix. Too many strands seem to get in the way of each other and don't seem to resolve well. Problem is that stops actors developing their stories. This also bloats the film and can make it sag, and overall it's overlong.<br/><br/>The big surprise is the 3D. It's absorbing and unobtrusive. Impressed. Thumbs up.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fine film. Could have cut out parts without devaluing the film, but most won't leave disappointed."
"skydragon-4","1","6","32","2 August 2014"," Worst movie yet
","First off, I'd like to say something - I loved the original Spiderman trilogy that Sam Raimi directed. I had watched Spiderman cartoons in the 80's and 90's and the older movies so had some exposure to this Marvel icon but was never too interested in the series until Raimi's movies came out. I was blown away by those movies and was saddened to find out that there won't be a fourth movie.<br/><br/>Then, The Amazing Spiderman was announced. Eventually, the trailer was released and I was cautiously optimistic for this reboot that seemed to promise better things. TASM was released, and it turned out to be a massive disappointment in my eyes. I didn't care at all about the actors, the story or the characters. It felt like a chore to watch and I'm still surprised that I didn't walk out of the cinema in disgust. I watched it later on BluRay thinking that maybe I was tired so should try harder to like it. It was still the same bad movie that I watched the first time around.<br/><br/>Then, TASM 2 was announced. A trailer was revealed and it looked good. So, there I go to watch TASM 2 at the cinema. It was even worse than the first movie! Long periods of boredom and I did not feel anything for Max Dillon or his (Later) Electro character. I didn't care about Peter's parents, Gwen, Harry (Well, I did care a little about him but that was because of DeHaan who was awesome to watch) or a lot of other things. Everything felt silly and pointless. Peter's parents' storyline was lame, there was way too much CGI and there was too many irrelevant parts of the storyline. All of this together made for, what was in my opinion, one of the worst movies that I've ever watched. And that's quite shocking for me because it's Spiderman.. How can any director make a bad Spiderman movie in this day and age when there's so much material to work with? I just wanted the movie to finish so I could leave and watch better things to get the sour taste out of my mouth over the fact that I had fallen for this a second time.<br/><br/>If you loved this movie, so be it. I personally thought it was terrible and I won't be watching another Spiderman movie while Marc Webb is directing whether it's the Sinister Six, Venom or TASM 3 because I won't fall for this again. In my opinion, Kurtzman and Orci should be removed as writers as well since they're to blame for the terribly silly script as well. I really wish Raimi would return and give another instalment for the original trilogy but I doubt that'll happen. In that case, the glory days for Spiderman ended at Spiderman 3 for me."
"mack-edward24","2","5","25","3 May 2014"," Worst Marvel Movie Ever Made
","Words cannot express how bad this movie is. There are many issues which plague this movie, some of which include bad acting, terrible sound editing, terrible script, and bastardizing the comic book story and characters that we all know and love. First, ill star off with the bad acting. This is one of the more minor flaws with the film (as it only applies to a few characters), but is still prevalent when it happens. The most horrific example of this is the German scientist and the actor who plays Rhino (for about 5 minutes, max). That was the worst acting I had seen since Tommy Wiseau in The Room. Next, we'll move on to the horrendous sound editing. A lot of my issue with this had to do with the songs; for example, songs being played where they don't fit the current scene, an overture sounding like it's from an old WWII propaganda video, loud, annoying, blaring dubstep at least once per scene which includes Electro. I swear, Electro should've been named Skrillex. He even makes dubstep (somehow) during an intense battle scene (that is one good thing about this movie; it had good CGI which made for cool battle scenes) by shooting electricity into several different pillar-like generators (which were never well explained; the only info we got about them was that they power all of NY, and the concept for them was created by the man who became Electro, before he turned evil). This doesn't even make sense. Next, I shall explain the how bad the script could be (at times). Again. This is one of the more minor issues with the movie, but I still found myself cringing at several different points in the movie because of its script. For example,during a scene where Harry Osborne teams up with Electro against one of the board members of Oscorp, Harry mentions how he tables have turned, and then says, ""am I right?"" To which Electro answers, ""right as rain."" Now, I understand that this is a common saying, but it doesn't fit the scene at all. It makes the scene seem somewhat silly and less dramatic. Now, let's move onto the worst of all of those piece of garbage's sins, the bastardization of the comic book characters and plot. For the characters, namely the Green Goblin and Rhino (who are in the movie collectively for about 10 minutes, I kid you not) who are completely different from their comic book predecessors. For the Green Goblin, first of all, he is NOT Norman Osborne, he is Harry Osborne, who contracts a fabricated genetic disease which kills Norman Osborne within the first 10 minutes of the movie. The Green Goblin's outfit looks silly as well. It looks like the left over Cyberman torso and legs painted green. For Rhino, first of all, he is in a strange mech outfit equipped with large MG's, rocket launchers, at least several inches of armor, and a strange metal horn-like thing on too of his head, rather than the real Rhino outfit. Rhino also gets defeated pretty easily; by Spiderman's first swing of a manhole to Rhino's several-foot-thick made of metal horn which should be strong enough to withstand the force if charging into things at high speed and therefore the force of being hit by a manhole. Not to mention that BOTH of these characters are some of Spiderman's most powerful (and famous) enemies, and deserve more than 10 minutes of screen time. Also, for the plot *MASSIVE SPOILER*, Gwen Stacey dies. Not only does she die, bit she died in the dumbest way - a long, overdrawn falling scene from the top of a bell tower, only to be almost saved by Spiderman, however, her head hits the ground (I guess), but her body never actually hits the ground, as she was webbed by Spiderman, and she most likely dies of a head injury (and there at least should be a broken back as well, as the motion of falling from a very tall bell tower was suddenly stopped with all of the pressure being forced onto her stomach, which would bend he body until the spine would snap, and most likely puncture several vital organs). And a final thought - there were many times where Spiderman should've died due to electrocution. And don't give me that ""healing factor"" crap that was made up for the purpose of trying to make some sort of sense to Harry Osborne's convoluted, ridiculous storyline of trying to cure himself of his disease. Overall, this terrible, horrible, awful installment of the Amazing Spideman series seriously falls short of being considered even average, as the only think keeping it from getting a 1 from me are the cool looking battle scenes."
"airsnob","4","2","7","23 August 2014"," For teenagers.
","This is the worst Super Hero movie I've ever seen. Besides the old Batmans. This is about teenagers, written for teenagers, and believed by teenagers. They lost me at - "" I love you so much. But I can't be with you because your dad asked me not to."" Ya. That kind of cheese. It seems like every tween/ teen movie has to have some tortured love affair, that isn't really tortured at all, but is made to be by the overly dramatic and emotional protagonists who create all their drama. Just because they have to be agonized over something. So, the story line is dumb. Just dumb. Not too much thinking involved here whatsoever on any kind of level. I mean. They didn't even try to sound smart. Characters, dumb. They didn't even try to make them realistic or cool at all. Just a bunch of unnessesary drama.. And exaggerated emotional response. Like a Soap Opera . But at the movies. The Villains are usually good in these big budget air headed cinema fast food, but even Electro let me down. Spider-Man / Peter Parker is just an obnoxious and arrogant kid, played well by whoever played him.. Just not appealing. At all. His girlfriend, same. Just another really skinny blonde girl in a movie .. No charisma. At all. I'm figuring these two must've known somebody or be related to someone to have landed these parts at all. Both not bad actors, just nothing else.. And I didn't want to stare at them. The script is irritating , juvenile, and overly confident, bordering on arrogant for all of it's mindless fluff. Don't watch this movie if you've taken high school science.. I know, I know, it's a fantasy; at least I believed Iron Man. That is essentially the problem with this movie. They don't have anything, to give you that you can believe. I mean, absolutely nothing."
"lasttimeisaw","6","2","7","7 May 2014"," On a par with the first one!
","My latest cinema-going of a 3D spectacle of the second chapter of the Amazing Spider-Man, whereas its first installment THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (2012, 6/10), a reboot of Sam Raimi's sensational SPIDER-MAN trilogy, is a hit-or-miss in general, but the Garfield and Stone pair does stand out with their affable affinity and spontaneous chemistry, so when it is time for Stone's Gwen Stacy to take a bow and exit the franchise, as fans know it from the start, her fate is presaged by the comic books, it is a double-edged sword to separate the most adorable couple in the marvel realm, initially one might be fixated in an ambiguity of thoughts that she will survive, since it has happened in THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10), but when the lingering shot fails to bring her back to life, it is somewhat tear-jerking and befuddling to realize she has been killed off just like that, as the expendable female character in any superhero franchise (like Maggie Gyllenhaal in THE DARK KNIGHT 2008, 8/10). It is a bold maneuver nevertheless (if Samuel L. Jackson's resurrection in CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER 2014, 7/10 could ring a bell), opens a new possibility for the following storyline, but I doubt anyone can follow her shoes because Stone's Gwen is not a cliché trophy girlfriend, she has brains, she leads the way in their relationship, Spidey is even willing to gives up his NYC territory and follow her to Great Britain, I would love to see a Spider-Man in London spin-off, which would be so tantalizing but sadly the production team will never allow that, Spidey represents the America's heroic spirit, so that's it, he is staying. <br/><br/>The 3 villains scenario has been oversold when they actually showoff in individual turns to combat Spider-man and Paul Giamatii's Rhino is basically a warm-up for next film, and the new Green Goblin Dane DeHaan pays off as a perfect choice thanks to the acute casting, his storyline is bypassed largely since Jamie Foxx's Electro is the MVP among the trio, which is rather badly written and utilized (his hatred towards Spider-man is so tediously manipulated and beyond logical reasoning). So with Gwen out of the picture, I assume next step is Spidey Vs. Green Goblin in their love-hate entanglement which is a safe bet for its mass appeal. <br/><br/>The acme of its standard action sequences by all means should be Electro's fluorescent and electricity-sizzling battlefield and his rampage in the Times Square, an eye-opener but the most vivid delight belongs to the affectionate magnetism, casual banters and escapades between Peter and Gwen, which is what director Marc Webb's strongest suit, at any rate, it is on a par with its predecessor, and the 3D effects are marginally passable this time, but honestly speaking I don't harbor too much hope for the third venture, there is perpetually a dearth of a weighty female counterparts in the marvel kingdom, let alone one has just been haplessly dispatched."

"fredschaefer-406-623204","8","2","7","5 May 2014"," A lot to like.
","The second film in a big tent pole series is where the film makers are supposed to seal the deal with the audience; sometimes they hit a home run and we get THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or THE DARK KNIGHT, and sometimes they foul out and we get THE MATRIX RELOADED. If the second film of the rebooted Spider Man franchise is not quite a hit out of the park, it still comes pretty close. The director, Marc Webb, manages to pull it off despite taking some risks with the material, mainly the kind of tweaking that drives comic book fans crazy and a running time of more than two hours that might try the patience of even the most ardent fan.<br/><br/>Despite that, THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN 2 is well worth the time because:<br/><br/>They get the hero right; Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is clearly having a blast being Spider Man. There's no Dark Knight like brooding here as he swings on his webs through NYC, ready to take on any bad guy in sight; and the wise cracks and jokes at the expense of the criminals go right back to the best work of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. It's not that Spider Man doesn't have a few ghosts to haunt his days and nights above the city streets: the specters of Uncle Ben and Captain Stacy are never far away. We always are aware that it is Peter Parker under the mask and that it's the man inside and not the spandex suite that counts.<br/><br/>Good villains; this is make or break in a super hero film because the antagonist should always be the the equal of or superior to the hero in order for him to be truly at risk. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN 2 has three, a dicey move, since if they get it wrong, the film could turn into BATMAN AND ROBIN. But they pull the trick off nicely, which should be no problem since Spider Man sports maybe the strongest villain bench of any comic book. Jamie Foxx plays Max Dillon, a nerdy and delusional Oscorp techie who morphs into Electro after falling into a tank of enhanced electric eels, giving him the power to command electricity; suddenly this pushed around and powerless man is omnipotent and goes completely off the deep end. Not that he wasn't way out on the plank to start with; which is firmly established in a character defining scene in Max's apartment where he gives himself a birthday cake and has a conversation with a phantom Spidey. Even more sinister is Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborn, Peter Parker's childhood friend and the new CEO of Oscorp, who, trying to cure himself of a fatal genetic disease, injects himself with spider venom (part of an experiment performed years before by Peter's long missing father) and transforms into the Green Goblin. A fair amount of time goes into setting up what motivates these villains by letting us get to know the person they were before fate or their own weakness led them to become the monsters they are now. The third villain is Paul Giamatti as the Russian thug, Alexi Sytsevich, who puts on a suite of high tech battle armor and becomes the Rhino; sadly for us Giamatti fans, he's not in the movie that much, but we're left with the promise he'll return in the future. The throwdowns between Spidey and his super powered foes are spectacular and a good use of CGI. I want to give a shout out to Colm Feore,a great character star, as a conniving Oscorp executive.<br/><br/>A great romance between Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker, which picks up right where the first film left off. Garfield and Stone have perfect chemistry together in their tentative relationship; she knows he's Spider Man and he doesn't want her to get hurt. I give the film makers props for letting the Gwen Stacey story play out on screen exactly the way it did in the comic; if you're a fan, I'm not giving anything away.<br/><br/>Staying true to the Marvel universe in that we get such staples as the Ravenscroft prison for the criminally insane, Oscorp, appearances by Alistair Smythe and Felicia Hardy, and glimpses of Doc Ock and the Vulture.<br/><br/>And don't be annoyed that the movie has nearly four climaxes in the last half hour,at least they resolve a lot of things and set it up right for the next Spider Man movie. Bring on Mary Jane Watson and The Sinister Six."
"sohansurag","6","2","7","2 May 2014"," Too Many Cooks, Yet Again, Spoils the Broth!
","Ah the Hollywood summer time starts and the next 3 months are lined up with some of the most anticipated movies of this year. Don't even get me started on the stars and budget of these flicks, everything seems marketed as the next best thing. From Bryan Cranston's Godzilla and Bryan Singer's X-Men Days of Future Past to Transformers Age of Extinction and Dawn Of Planet of The Apes and then some more. Apparently a separate budget needs to be planned for the same, cutting back some of em. A tough choice indeed.<br/><br/>While Sony's decision to reboot Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise could be best tagged 'hasty', The Amazing Spider-man garnered enough attention and good critiques that they even green lit its 3rd and 4th sequels, all thanks to Andrew Garfield's portrayal of a 'better' Peter Parker and Marc Webb's direction. Frankly I am a fan of Sam Raimi's original trilogy and as opposed by many, I liked Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker more and maybe . But seems like Garfield's Peter Parker has grown on me and although I initially hated The Amazing Spider-man, I couldn't let go a Spider-man sequel. Just like Marvel's movies, I was bound to watch this and I did in all its splendor in IMAX. I so sorely wanted to add "".and boy, I loved it"" but unfortunately it neither had the charm nor the oomph I'd anticipated for.<br/><br/>To start things off, we're shown the unfortunate demise of Peter's parents and the movie revolves around the the mysteries involved with the same. But it gets lost amidst Peter and Gwen's mushy romance. I appreciate Marc Webb's expertise with handling romance, as evident from 500 Days of Summer, but it also felt like too much time had been allotted for Peter and Gwen's goofy on and off relationship. It worked well in the comics but on celluloid it felt gratuitous and cheesy. And now let's discuss villains, shall we? What's with Sony and squeezing as much villains as possible in a spidey movie? Don't they know that saying 'Too many cooks spoil the broth or haven't they learnt anything from Spider-man 3? As obvious from the tag 'Rise of Electro', The Amazing Spider-Man 2's main villain is Electro and he would have sufficed for a good movie. But No, Sony just had to squeeze in Green Goblin and Rhino as well, even if it means mere minutes of them. Of the lot, Electro was impressive and tells us to stay away from obsessive 'nobody' like Max Dillon. And by the time he 'rises' to power his fickle-mindness can only matched with his ego and obsession. The Times Square scene in particular was tense, Electro felt like a bomb about to explode and spidey had to play all the right strings to keep him calm.<br/><br/>Andrew Garlfield once again dons the Spider-man spandex suit and is bit less annoying than the first. Then again he never felt even remotely threatened by adversaries and on the other hand he seemed more worried and preoccupied with his relationship with Gwen. Weirdly, his performance felt better when he was suited up than not. Emma Stone is a brilliant actor but even she was like this adrenaline junkie who couldn't stay away from Spidey and the antagonists and in the end she just becomes a damsel in distress than anything. Jamie Foxx showcased an electrifying performance as Electro (all puns intended) and even as Max, he was able to convincingly pull off his innocent yet obsessive shades. He was well intimidating as Electro, a worthy contender for Spider-man but thanks to inane script it was never fleshed out. Dane Dehaan is no stranger playing antagonist and does a fair job of playing Harry Osborn/Green Goblin and may even slide into being a formidable villain in the upcoming sequels. Oh and by the way, Paul Giamatti plays Aleksei Sytsevich, a thug-turned-Rhino with a weird Russian which is best left at that.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-man is surely dark and the weird injection of comedy was another nuance I found. Agreed, Spidey is meant to be a wisecracking superhero, but no superhero would be wisecracking if his or the one he loves' life is at stake, it makes the sequence less tense. And talk about 'being dark', the bodycounts were enormous this time and i can only imagine how much would have been at stake on the Time Square and highway stunts, yet the narrative just goes on not even addressing the grim things that just happened, crowds cheered, people went about their daily lives as if there was absolutely no threat in the horizon.<br/><br/>The movie clocks in at a runtime of 142 minutes so good luck if you have a weak bladder. Despite the long runtime it becomes victim to some flimsily edited sequences. Action sequences were abruptly put to stop and there were some transitions where it felt like ""Did the film reel just do a backflip?"" Felicia Hardy makes a cameo and could be, hopefully, seen as Black Cat later on in the franchise. The same goes for the excellent end-credit sequence that kept us guessing, leading to speculations of the The Sinister Six.<br/><br/>The score from Hans Zimmer and Pharell Williams upped the ante a bit this time able to give that much needed soul which the first lacked. And thanks to the same, Spider-man swinging by gave me goosebumps. I guess its in every fanboy's wishlist to do so and to watch it live in all the IMAX glory, it was nothing short of spectacular.<br/><br/>Marc Webb is undoubtedly a skilled director but with no guidance from Marvel I guess he was just as lost as we were. Its time for Marvel to buy back its most beloved character. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 falls into the familiar mediocre territory that its predecessor fell into."

","It's been awhile since a movie has made me feel as bipolar as TASM2. At times I'm fully engaged, and at other times I'm wondering, ""Is this the worst superhero movie ever?"" The spectacle and intrigue are present, and the comic-booky look of the film provides some theme-park-ride-like fun. Nonetheless, TASM2's chaotic editing, over directing, and misguided stylization left me in a web of frustration. TASM2 catches up with Peter, aka Spider-Man, as he's settling into his hero-role, all the while dealing with regular teenage life (girlfriend, graduation, etc). But as is wont to happen in superhero tent-poles, a few big baddies show up to ruin Spidey's day. Giamatti cameos as The Rhino; DeHaan plays Harry Osbourne, heir to the evil Oscorp fortune; and Foxx is mild-mannered Max, who falls into a vat of eels and becomes Electro because, ya knowSCIENCE! Nothing and no one is given any amount of time to develop with simply too many stories and too many characters to manage. Worst of all is the atrocious score. For one glaring example, Electro's theme music is composed of goofy bumbling horns, backed by sinister choir vocals singing his very thoughts (""What's happening to me!"" ""I hate Spider-Man!""). A score shouldn't be overtly noticeable, but especially not overtly bad. Again, some stuff works. Garfield is still a better Spidey than Tobey Maguire ever was, and the icon heavy imagery during the final big battle is beautifully handled. Unfortunately these positives only serve to add to the irritation, that there is a decent reboot to be made here. Regrettably the spidey senses weren't tingling for this one."

Back in the 80s and 70s, but in the year 2014, we expected great things from Amazing Spider Man. Surprisingly it was in fact amazingly shitty. <br/><br/>This movie is almost everything I didn't want in a spider man movie and makes this awful sequel for the web shooter. This movie takes place after the events of the previous film where Peter Parker is on top of the world. He has everything going for him and then he meets Harry Osborn and Jamie Foxx is introduced as the villain ""electro"" and Parker's life turns to s**t. <br/><br/>I'll start off by talking about the good. Andrew Garfield is a great spider man, he portrays the character really well. That's the only good I have to say about this film. This review may just seem like I am hating on an average film, when in reality I am making a good case to not see this piece of s**t. I think Emma Stone is great actress, one of the best working today, but in this film I just- just don't know what she's doing. The relationship between her and Peter Parker is so poorly written it's incredible to see that from this kind of movie. At one point Emma Stone says in the film ""I'd break up with Peter,"" What does that even f*****g mean. Dan Dehaan is a great actor as well, but he was absolutely awful as Harry Osborne. He so mundane and so mad all the time, he was more like a cartoon character. This movie is a huge mess. All the events in the film don't flow together at all, While the screenplay itself is s**t, the story just bugged me. It seemed like they took the most generic Spider Man story possible and put it into this film. I wasn't interested at all what was happening to Peter and Gwen mainly because it came straight out of the comics. Now that isn't a problem for everyone, but you see everything from a mile away, it's so predictable. Now believe it or not their are more problems with this movie. Number one the action scenes almost felt unnecessary, which is a big problem to have in a Superhero movie. It seemed like during action scene I thought to myself ""hm they could just talk it out"" TALK IT OUT! That is the last thing I want to think during a movie like this. I want the action to make the movie have weight and significance, but it didn't work in this film. The action scenes felt more like they were there because the script said so and not because it made sense. Even some of the worst action movies make the action scenes matter in a way. The special effects are good though, what I expected, but as we all know special effects can't make a great movie cough ""Titanic"" cough. The most glaring problem with this movie was the villains. Like Spider-Man 3 there is too many villains that the movie wants to spend time developing. One of villains in the trailer was barely in the movie, He was heavily advertised and everything, what the f**k. <br/><br/>Overall The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a huge piece of s**t and I don't recommend seeing it. Spider-Man Homecoming looks awesome, so here's hoping this movie will be forgotten soon."

","It is such a difficult task to beat the sheer cinematic brilliance that was the original Spider-Man trilogy<br/><br/> but somehow they manage.<br/><br/>If I didn't think so in the first movie, this movie confirmed for me that Andrew Garfield is the perfect choice to play Peter Parker. The thing that captured my attention in this movie is that it doesn't feel like he is acting, it's feels like that is his actual personality and traits.<br/><br/>The same can be said with Emma Stone. When those two share a scene together, it's like they aren't acting at all.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of foreshadowing to the future Spider-Man movies and the planned spin- offs and even references and small appearances by characters that may or may not live up to their comic destiny in this universe.<br/><br/>Something I also liked was the new Green Goblin costume. This version has a sense of realism to it, something you can see an actually villain wearing, not some cartoon character costume like the William Dafoe/James Franco costume looked like.<br/><br/>There is a scene between Peter and Aunt May that is just remarkable! Certainly shows you why Andrew Garfield is where he is now and why Sally Field has been nominated and won so many awards in her acting career!<br/><br/>If you are a fan of comic books and/or the first Amazing Spider-Man, well you probably would have already seen this, but if you haven't than you should get on that! This will definitely be a Day 1 purchase for me."
"r_massey","6","2","8","16 November 2014"," Spider-Man is Spider-Man, at last!
","Spidey has been my favourite superhero for as long as I can remember and though I never grew up reading the comics, I absorbed the 90s ""The Animated Series"" as a kid, which included a great roster of characters, villains and stories from the comics themselves.<br/><br/>""You wanna know what I love about being Spider-Man? Everything."" Yeah, you said it Andrew Garfield because you are THE Spider-Man. Sony have given Spidey the big treatment; Spider-Man is as Spider-Man as Spider-Man can usually get, he's witty, quippy, strong, agile, his web-swinging looks better than ever and the filmmakers made the right choice in listening to the fans and changing the suit, giving us a Spider-Man that is a lot more comic-book accurate (or in my case, something that's a lot more in line with the Spider-Man I know from the 90s cartoon).<br/><br/>The visuals look great, especially with Electro present on screen and everything seems a lot more vibrant and lively which is refreshing after the filmmakers had made the wrong choice in making the first installment too dark and realistic for the character of Spider-Man and his world.<br/><br/>The cast is incredible and having not seen him in a movie before, Dane DeHaan really stands out and was a pleasant surprise for me.<br/><br/>However, the film suffers A LOT from poor writing and a lack of narrative direction. There is a jumble of sub-plots that ultimately tie in to ""Oscorp"" but there is no linearity, no real sense of progression in the story, leaving you a little bored and uninterested in all the little threads that are meant to somehow tie together. While I like the attempt at being more lighthearted, most of the comedy drags on a little and is only really funny the first time around.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx was a waste as Electro and pushed it a little too far in playing a goofy Max Dillon that we are meant to sympathise with. Yes, it's easy to understand Electro's motivations but the film does that in too much of a silly manner and this 'main villain' is locked away for a good chunk of the film before having some kind of purpose towards the ending.<br/><br/>**SPOILERY PART** As I said, while DeHaan's performance was great, it doesn't help that his character, Harry Osborn, was rushed and became the Goblin way too soon, only really being introduced for the purpose of killing off Gwen at the end of the film and trying to stay somewhat accurate to the comics.<br/><br/>While her ending was probably best left for the sequel, leaving room for a bigger build-up to the event, it still had a huge emotional impact due to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's wonderful chemistry on-screen, again, throughout the film. Andrew Garfield's reaction to her death was heartbreaking and this film was the first film to ever leave me in quite an emotional wreck; a testament to how great the casting has been for the rebooted franchise, especially Garfield's presence in these movies.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" had the potential to be probably the greatest Spider-Man movie out there, they hit so many great notes such as Spider-Man's characterisation, bringing Hans Zimmer on board to score the film (which he did excellently for both action scenes and very emotional moments in the film), an excellent cast and the potential to move anywhere they wanted in terms of the story after having covered Spider-Man's origin in the predecessor.<br/><br/>However, all is let down by poor writing, leaving bad pacing, a jumbled story and frankly, a film that tries to achieve too much in too little time, suffering from having to kinda resolve the ""Untold Story"" about Peter's parents from the first film and then introducing two other villains (Rhino doesn't really count and I'm not bothered by his appearance at the end of the film, it worked well).<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that, once again, Sony are looking to the success of other films, trying to copy the Marvel Cinematic Universe and create an expanded Spider-Man movie universe before firmly establishing other characters/villains that could lead into interesting spin-offs that the general audience will want to see. Sony have wasted their attempt at proving that the Spider-Man reboot was initially a great idea with the mistakes they made in TASM2, some mistakes that also cropped up in Spider-Man 3 (surely they would have learned by now). This film was the make or break for this franchise and has led people to wonder whether Spider-Man is in the right hands. Does that mean he should go back to Marvel, so that he can appear alongside the Avengers? No, not really, it just means that Sony need to step up their game and focus on making their own, decent Spider-Man film and not looking at how successful other franchises are doing.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" has some great elements which really shine, hence my generous score for the film, but a poor story that holds the film back from being anything more than just your average Spider-Man film."
"kosmasp","6","2","8","17 September 2014"," Getting down
","The movie starts off interestingly enough and Andrew Garfield almost falls into the Sam Raimi trap (Spiderman 3) where Tobey Maguire had a sequence where he ""tried"" to be cool. Garfield though does kind of pull that off, even though it's very frenetic and does make little sense (other than to be revisited towards the end). Still Andrews Peter Parker is lovable (mostly).<br/><br/>There is a sense of overload though and especially the character portrayed by Jamie Foxx is not playing well into all of this. It's a shame, because Foxx has proved that he can be part of a big movie (see Django Unchained), but he's not working here. The motives are clear in the big picture, but the way they do get ""unleashed"" is not realized in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the special effects are really good and if you let yourself into it, the movie will take you onto a ride. With a few surprises along the way ... well at least one for me!"
"yakuzaiam","10","2","8","31 August 2014"," Read the some comics first, then come back.
","I LOVED the movie and have no idea why everyone keeps saying they hate it. I'm a huge Amazing Spider Man fan and have quite a large collection of comic books. I've seen reviews go on about ""Why re-do the trilogy?"". While there may be some factors unclear to a lot of people, some are very clear to me. The first, and most important factor, doing it right. This movie, and the first one, both did the comics great justice. Peter is way more like himself in these films. The old films were filled with a bunch of Hollywood drama garbage, where as in these films, they nearly copied the comics word for word (Exaggeration). Don't get me wrong, it wasn't word for word, but compared to the old films, it might as well have been. The Special effects in this film were amazing. I recall myself blurting out in amazement at certain scenes. I just do not understand why so many people hate it so dang much. I guess some people gotta have there soppy love stories to keep them happy. To all those people, go and watch the old ones, and leave the good ones to people who know what they're talking about."
"Shonsu","6","2","8","20 August 2014"," The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.
","OK, so right off the bat I want to say that I enjoyed the film and thought it was really good when I saw it in theaters. And I've been a Spider-Man fan for almost 25 years. He was the first comic book I bought and I read his comics near religiously for many years.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed both of these films as movies, and have greatly enjoyed Garfield's performance as Spider-Man. However, I can't stand him as Peter, and I'm not a fan of Sally Fields as Aunt May either. Nor do I like Dane DeHaan as Harry. <br/><br/>But I love all the Spider-Man scenes. Every one of them. I love how they show him moving, I love the quips he does while fighting. Everything.<br/><br/>The Electro plot I think was done really well, I enjoyed how it went and felt Jamie Foxx did a good portrayal of him. It didn't feel too quick or hurried or drawn out. It pretty much felt just about right. So that's the good. Spider-Man and Electro... Good. Very good.<br/><br/>On to the bad... The Goblin portions felt crammed in, as did Rhino.<br/><br/>***Minor Spoiler***<br/><br/>Both Goblin and Rhino are so short it's almost like cameos... Goblin (as the villain) doesn't show up till after the climatic battle with Electro and the Rhino is only on screen for a brief bit at the end. I guess it's supposed to introduce them for future films, but it just didn't feel like it fit in.<br/><br/>And now the ugly... The Goblin's makeup... oh god what were they thinking? He looks like some sort of punk rock reject who got dipped in Toxic Waste. Worst portrayal of the Green Goblin, and I'm including Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>p.s. ***Major Spoiler***<br/><br/>I did enjoy the inclusion of Gwen's death and how they did it so close to the comics. While it was sad, it was sort of fulfilling in a strange sort of way."
"James_Hetfield_1980","6","2","8","5 August 2014"," Another sequel of an unnecessary reboot!
","Firstly this entire reboot was unnecessary! I mean, we were introduced to Spider- man by Sam Raimi in 2002. Tobey as Spider man, Kirsten as Mary Jane and so on. These characters and their roles were etched in our memory for a decade! 10 freaking years we could only relate to these people and we were happy.<br/><br/>Now in 2012, they decided to reboot the entire franchise. Bloody same story with different actors! Whats the f**king point. Peter is bitten by spider, his life before and after being Spider man, his love life, his struggles with the same, relation with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, everything is the same .. but with different actors. Again.. whats the f**king point ?<br/><br/>No doubt Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy) have done a good job but we tend to draw comparisons with the earlier franchise, especially when so many of the aforementioned situations are the same.<br/><br/>Okay, now coming back to this movie. This is strictly a one-time watch movie. I didn't have much expectations anyway but I was still a bit disappointed by a few things.<br/><br/>1. The transformation of the villain Electro was done in a bit of hurry. One moment he idolizes Spider man and next moment he hates him because he forgot his name! WTF. They should have developed his villainy character a bit. It was not at all convincing.<br/><br/>2. Some of the things were happening for the sake of happening. It seriously lacked depth.<br/><br/>3. Killing off the main actress and love interest of Spidey so that they can introduce another actress (most probably Mary Jane) in the next sequel, was a big turn off<br/><br/>4. Some Characters and transformation of both villains are woefully under- developed<br/><br/>However, the chemistry between Spidey and Gwen was good and some of the action sequences are pretty good. Spidey has been shown as having some sense of humor and has smart and funny one-liners. That was also welcoming"

All I could think about was how the movie ruined for me.. but boy was i wrong.... I enjoyed every detail in the movie from the high actioned packed moments to Spiderman's phone ring-tone. Now if your a fan of the comics, you'll love this movie. It introduces a lot of familiar names and potential villains we'd like to see in the coming movies. If your not a fan of the comics, you'll still love the movie but i recommend you watch "" the amazing Spiderman 1"" before seeing this one, as it explains a lot of the amazing chemistry between Peter and Gwen. I don't want to give away any Spoilers, but this movie has it all from action to romance to comedy, etc.. enjoy it and lets hope for a better sequel ;)"
"DareDevilKid","9","2","8","11 May 2014"," The Franchise that Spider-Man Well and Truly Deserved
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4/5 stars<br/><br/>Nobody understands the dynamics, material, relationships, and character traits of our fabled wall-crawler as well as Director, Marc Webb, and all subsequent cinematic versions of Spider-Man should be churned out by nobody else but Webb and his keen visionary skills. Like an astute artisan, he seamlessly weaves together a stupendous plot replete with equal amounts of action, drama, emotions, romance, and mystery, to dish out one of the most enthralling summer blockbusters that memory can serve. Lending huge gravitas to Webb's opulent vision are the brilliant performances from Garfield, Stone, Foxx, DeHaan, along with terrific editing ,cinematography, and some of the most amazing visual effect and CGI rendered on screen.<br/><br/>If you thought that Webb's first cinematic rendition of Spidey was head and shoulder above Raimi's trilogy, then his latest film knocks all three of Raimi's mildly entertaining but poorly adapted movies right out of the park. Those who don't agree with this reboot of Spider-Man, need to view both the films against their predecessors and then perform a little research by way of the source material from the comics and the classic animated series, to see for themselves which versions stack up better against each other. Casual, impassive viewers who might feel that this would constitute as a waste time just for the sake of a film, would be quicker and more capable at differentiating between which is the better made franchise."
"kyle-takacs","7","2","8","5 May 2014"," TAS 2 Has all the makings of a summer blockbuster
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to be cheesy, romantic, dark, funny, and epic, all without feeling bloated.<br/><br/>Now that the new Spiderman series has its origin story out of the way, it ups the ante with more characters and plot lines that manage to all work without this almost two and a half hour movie feeling too crowded. Paul Giamatti's Rhino, who is only in it for a few minutes, and Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon bring a cheesiness to the series that is reminiscent of the original. Once Electro is cemented as the main villain of the movie, Spiderman doesn't see much of him. The marketing of the movie would lead you to believe that Spiderman is taking on three enemies at once, but not only does that not happen, there really isn't that much Spidey action overall.<br/><br/>The film focuses a lot on Peter and Gwen's relationship, which surprisingly doesn't slow the movie down, and Harry Osborn gets a lot of screen time too. He is introduced as Peter's friend, who is a likable and sympathetic character, and Dane Dehaan does an excellent job. <br/><br/>One subplot that seems thrown in is the mystery of Peter's parents. With a lot of buildup from the first movie, the solving of the mystery wasn't satisfying and that story arc was unnecessary in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a great summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"coolcleangreen","8","2","8","5 May 2014"," i love this Spider-Man!
","casting really is half the battle in movies. the cast was amazing! Jamie Foxx as Electro was comical and earnest making this villain my favorite so far (plus, Electro's animation was beautiful, and his heavy metal inner monologue theme was brilliant). Sally Field showed up in this installment! i saw this with my mom, and SF brought us both to tears. Dane DaHaan is the creepiest most sympathetic Harry Osborn to imagine. i could buy this Spidey and this Goblin as friends who are two sides of the same coin.<br/><br/>i seriously disliked the previous Spider-Man movies (even though set in a different time) because i never bought Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man or any of the rest of the cast for that matter. Andrew Garfield, however, has done an amazing job with my beloved Spidey. He's equal parts brain, sport, and heart - a mixture missing from the previous one.<br/><br/>the story is the other half of the battle. the writing in these two stories have been light years better than the previous versions, making abandonment, inadequacy, and bullying just as important to feature as science and love.<br/><br/>so i must say i really love this Spider-Man. keep up the good work."
"infernalaffairs1980","8","2","8","5 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","If the first film was an origin story then this is Spider-man's coming of age. We spend most of the time, not with Spidey facing off with the bad guys, but working on his relationship with Gwen Stacey. Garfield and Stone still spark off of each other making the whole relationship angle interesting without being sickly. We also get more information about Peter's father and his work with Oscorp which gives this version more depth than the original trilogy.<br/><br/>And onto the bad guys. The trailer has given us a glimpse of three villains and there has been some concern over bad guy overkill. Rest assured, while Rhino and the Goblin do make appearances, this is the Electro show. Jamie Foxx's transformation from super geek to super villain is a marvel (sorry) and the special effects for his look are outstanding. At one point in the film I was worried we were going to be treated to a Dr. Manhattan (Watchmen) moment, but thankfully this film is a 12A so a suit is mysteriously added to save everyone's blushes.<br/><br/>The new Harry Osborn is an improvement over the whiny James Franco portrayal. Dane Dehaan is suitably cast as a poor little rich boy who shows his true colours when he doesn't get his own way. By the end I wanted to give him a good slap, the sign that he played his part well.<br/><br/>Sally Field returns as Aunt May and, although in only a few scenes, she acts others off the screen. When she has a heart to heart with Peter I could feel myself start to choke up (but we'll keep that between ourselves).<br/><br/>Garfield and Stone truly shine yet again. Stone's Gwen Stacey is feisty, gorgeous and intelligent, giving the audience a girl who is a believable equal to Peter Parker and Spider-man. Garfield has a tough job having to give us a sarcastic, lovable hero whilst also portraying a young man with relationship troubles and daddy issues. He manages to pull it off, although I admit to preferring his spandex clad Spidey.<br/><br/>Fans will be happy to know that there are several hints concerning the future of this franchise as well as spin offs... just keep watching."
"johnpbrady","8","2","8","5 May 2014"," Better than expected...
","Over the past 12 years, there has been 5 movies where our friendly- neighborhood web-slinger has been brought to life to share his story with us. After hearing that there would be no ""Spider-Man 4"" with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man for the (would be) sequel to Spider-Man 3, I was pretty upset. But, once I was informed that there would be no sequel to the trilogy, but a reboot, I was even more upset. I grew up on ""the original Spider-Man"" and I was not quite sure. Being a fan of comics though, especially Spidey, I knew that the previous trilogy didn't exactly go along well with what most of us viewers knew. Then when I heard that the new reboot was going to go along with the storyline of the comics, I was stoked.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), in my opinion, was exactly what needed to happen in order for this franchise to be successful. The actors, characters, music, even the high-intensive CGI that was used by Director Marc Webb and his crew was outstanding. I couldn't have been more excited for a sequel in my life. And when I saw The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) the night it was released, I was in awe. The way the writers and Webb portrayed Peter in this was great. It truly showed how he was still a teenage kid, who hasn't exactly grown up to his full potential yet, trying to find his way out of a ""complicated"" relationship with Gwen, lies from his Aunt May, and still trying to be the ""hero"" of the city. Everything in this movie was great, especially Emma Stone. Her and Andrew's relationship (on and off-screen) is fantastic. Also, the music was very well put together, especially in the high-intensity fight scenes between Spidey and Electro. Not to forget the romantic songs that took place as well.<br/><br/>And of course, the ending. From the first 20 minutes into the movie, I knew something was going to happen to Gwen. And, sadly, it did. I never get too emotional in movies, but for some odd reason, this got to me. Maybe it was the growing love for another that set this up. Which, I'm pretty sure it was. This will surely show how Peter adapt in becoming the true hero we know and love, and possibly seeing a certain someone in the near future...(MJ).<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was well put together. Nothing special, but definitely a must-see. And please, ignore all the negative reviews, because I have no idea what they were watching while this great Spidey movie was being played."

"dustyfairyza","9","2","8","5 May 2014"," The Amazing Spiderman
","I loved this movie. What people seem to forget is that Spidey has been a superhero for a while now. and that everything is basically a day to day for him. What the focus of the movie is, is the promise he made to Gwen's father, and his relationship with Gwen. It is basically a love story. They want to be together, but they have all these obstacles in their way. Spiderman is torn between letting her go, keeping her safe, and away from the dangerous life of being a superhero. and being with her. what we learn in this movie is that Peter was meant to become Spiderman, his father genetically linked it to him. I don't think he intended for Peter to become Spiderman, that's not what I am saying, but it does feel a little as if Peter went looking for it. It was his destiny. The action sequences/special effects is just a bonus. The story is quite simple. not over stuffed like some critics are saying, or that the story is disjointed, also not true.<br/><br/>You get two kinds of critics, those who walk into a cinema, thinking about what they want to see, and then they judge every second, how they can use whatever happens to write a negative review. and then you get people who watch a movie with no expectation, and just get taken by the story, they later reflect on what they saw, and judge the movie as a complete package. The Amazing Spiderman was a great story. I was on the edge of my seat, and the ending was shocking and beautifully done. The Spidey-web-hand reaching out will join my list of best movie moments of all time. like the pear in the road in City of Angels, the hand on the screen in Armageddon, the red shoelaces in Up Close and Personal. The white handkerchief in Braveheart."
"fdbjr","8","2","8","5 May 2014"," The Flavor of the Original
","I am just back from the movie, and a little amazed at some of the so-so reviews. Based on those, I was expecting the movie to be unfocused and wandering, and Gwen Stacy to be marginalized as a character.<br/><br/>Did those critics even see the same movie? The thematic plot was all about Spiderman and Gwen Stacy, in the episodic form of the original creation. One critic claimed that Peter's wry, subtle joke from the first movie, to the effect that the best promises are those you can't keep, was ignored in this movie. This simply missed the point entirely. The drama is consumed with Peter's conflict between his affection for Gwen, and the danger to which he is exposing her. It's actually rather tightly focused. <br/><br/>It is also true to one of the major themes of the original, the media controversy over Spiderman's character (hero or villain?) But most of all, the screenplay manages to capture the considerable wit and badinage of the characters as they first appeared in the 60's.<br/><br/>Need I add it was visually spectacular? All in all, a really nice achievement."

"madman18I","8","2","8","4 May 2014"," It may not be PERFECT but at least it's truer to it's source
","I would take two minutes of a Norman Osborn whose every word to his son drips with hate and disgust and is capable of controlling his company and a vast network of other elements over a Norman Osborn who is weak,whiny,oblivious and ineffectual all throughout two hours. Electro was done pitch perfectly. A nobody who got stepped on most of his life getting virtually infinite power and going on a power trip. I'll take Dane Dehaan's mutant Evil Ed Goblin over dime store plastic Goblin or Harry on a flying skateboard any day. And I'd RATHER have it NOW than wait an entire ARC for it only to get screwed in the end. I thought that Rhino was perfect in the spot they gave him. He's a blustering fourth tier idiot of a villain. How big a role do you EVER expect him to play!? Andrew Garfield is more like Spider-Man AND Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire EVER was. Tobey Peter: Empty headed neanderthal whose only solution to everything was punch the bad guy in the face until he says uncle(which is literally how EVERY movie in that series ended). Andrew Peter: Scientific genius who invents and upgrades his own equipment to compensate for an enemy's powers. Emma Stone really embodied Gwen Stacy and the writers give nods to even the smallest parts of her arc(her at one point going to England). Her death scene was definitely as impactful in this movie as in the comics when it happened. It was no more a jarring tone change than it was when it happened in that issue. Dane Dehaan gives Harry the easy charm Harry is known for mixed with an air of moral ambiguity that keeps him interesting until he becomes the Green Goblin. His later desperation is TOTALLY believable in one who is close to death. I cannot praise Chris Cooper enough for doing so much with so little. I would take his Norman Osborn over Dafoe's any day. All in all this movie might have flaws but it's flaws don't compare to all the dissatisfying things about the first series. So I'll take it."

","I loved this movie. It had passion, love, anger, revenge - every human emotion that makes it believable. I think Jamie Foxx's villain was great - it was different and exciting because he was so powerful. <br/><br/>I didn't follow the comics but the amazing spider man is sooooo much better than those Tobey McGuire fiascos - I hated all of those movies. The effects ... had my son drooling. I think this spiderman had just enough humor without being showy but enough to be entertaining. <br/><br/>I took 2 stars away because: the relationship between Peter and Harry didn't seem ""life long"" type deal. I think they could have built that a bit more.<br/><br/>And another away from aunt mae who was taking classes to pay bills? That makes no sense. School COSTS money. Perhaps I miss heard and she was teaching? It's small but so much of the dialogue was built around that premise between Peter and aunt mae. <br/><br/>Anyway, all in all - wonderful and heart wrenching. GREAT JOB!"
"theaterdork228","8","2","8","3 May 2014"," Where is all the hate coming from?
","This was the best Spider-Man film I've ever seen. The action was gripping and intense. The villains(especially Dane DeHann) were compelling if not a little bit cheesy. The character interaction was pure Spider-Man, from Peter's quips in the suit to Gwen's and his conversations it all felt organic and genuine. Not to mention the powerful chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil anything here, but the plot moves a surprisingly brisk pace despite it carrying a fair amount of story threads. Only dragging in a handful of moments, but other moments seemed to make up for it.<br/><br/>I keep seeing complaints that the film was too CGI heavy and that just seems like an odd thing to point out since while yes there are a lot effects in the movie they all look amazing. No one can tell me with a straight face the opening scene where Spidey is swinging around the city wasn't gorgeous.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the soundtrack which was a major step up from the previous film's bland flavorless garbage. Each character had a distinct theme and clever instrumentation to accompany it. While yes the infamous dubstep is implemented it does it in a way that makes sense and doesn't feel tasteless. Not to mention the new Spider-Man theme gave me chills.<br/><br/>One of the things I keep seeing is that focus on the romance between Peter and Gwen is very Twilight like. I feel like the people who say that haven't seen or read Twilight, in Twilight the main character cannot be self-sufficient and needs man to come hold her and make all the bad feelings go away. In this film while yes there is a central romance involving teenagers it's a healthier relationship in which both participants have other obligations they must tend to thus killing their relationship. They aren't dependent on each other as they more are simply clinging to the only bit constant in their lives as everything changes.<br/><br/>That all being said yes this film as some problems and isn't perfect. Electro is pretty bland for as far as villains go, but he's still interesting. Jamie Foxx just hams it up every time he's on screen which really is odd compared to DeHann who plays a much more subdued character. And when the story drags, you can really feel it. This doesn't it make it a bad film or detract from the really well done scenes.<br/><br/>Overall don't believe the hate, it's fun and more importantly better than Man of Steel and Spider-Man 3."
"Autonomous_1","8","2","8","2 May 2014"," The critics got this one wrong...this is one of the best SM films yet
","TASM2 is an easy movie to hate before even seeing it. It represents many things that are wrong with the modern movie industry. It represents disloyalty to Sam Raimi, the director of the original and highly successful Spider-Man trilogy, who wanted an extra year to make Spider-Man 4 so he could get it right but was fired by Sony. It represents Hollywood's tendency to throw the same, minimally altered story lines and characters at audiences year after year in order to avoid the risk of releasing an unfamiliar but potentially refreshing new movie. It represents the commercialism that is increasingly necessary to float big-budget movies, what with the three sequels to 2012's TASM announced shortly after that movie's opening weekend, and now a Sinister Six spin off, teased in the post-credits scene in TASM2. Having grown up watching the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy myself and seeing each of them in movie theaters multiple times, I would seemingly have every reason to write off Marc Webb's SM movies as redundant and unworthy of my attention, and yet I was disarmed of every such thought while watching TASM2. Strip away all the ominous things about the movie industry that TASM series represents, and you'll realize TASM2 is a very well-crafted superhero movie, not as innovative or airtight as Nolan's the Dark Knight movies, but every bit the equal of Raimi's best SM movies and superior, I'd argue, to the recent batch of Avengers movies.<br/><br/>Like those Raimi movies and TASM1, TASM2 is thematically rich as well as being a feast of eye candy, visual effects, action sequences, and sexy guys in spandex. Never being satisfied with just being a simple tale of good vs. evil, TASM presents a compelling tale in which people must make decisions that are in the moral gray zone and then face the consequences of those decisions. This movie recalls The Dark Knight in that regard. We sympathize with both the heroes and villains and, like the characters, often realize that there is nothing anyone could do in certain circumstances that could solve every problem. The only choice the characters have is to do what they feel is right in the moment and hope for the best. Such is the case when Peter is faced with the dilemma of helping his old friend, Harry Osborn (brilliantly portrayed by Dane Dehaan—who is James Franco again?) by giving him some of Spider-Man's blood, which may save him from the disease that killed his father, or alternatively kill him if the blood turns out to be incompatible. What Peter ends up choosing isn't important—it's easy to see how a riveting tale could result whichever action Peter decided on. Poor Peter is in the precarious position of risking the lives of everyone who is close to him by endangering them, and this leads us into caring about each of the characters much more deeply than what I'm accustomed to during a superhero film.<br/><br/>Harry Osborn eventually turns into the Green Goblin, and the other main villain is introduced early. He is Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, and he spawned from the brilliant but socially awkward electrical engineer Max. Electro's setup is admittedly very weak. While it's easy enough to sympathize with a highly intelligent and innovative person who doesn't receive the positive social interaction he craves, Max takes this to ridiculous levels by literally plotting to kill Spider-Man simply because he doesn't remember his name after saving him from being run over by a car. This plot depends on Max having the mentality of a child, and this makes the motivations of his villain a bit of a facepalmer. The Green Goblin thus becomes the film's saving grace. Unlike Spider-Man 3, which also clumsily handled its villains, the Green Goblin comes in at just the right time to deliver a badass climax to the film that helps us forget how weak the Electro storyline ever was. Harry doesn't die in this movie, and at the end we see him plot with some other bad guys to plan revenge, and I can't wait to see how that plays out in TASM3 (or the Sinister Six, whichever movie arrives first).<br/><br/>The elements of the production of the film besides the plot are generally quite good. Andrew Garfield gives the best performance of Peter Parker and Spider-Man that I've seen thus far in any Spidey movie, alternating between social awkwardness, guilt, hero, and comic book humor with admirable grace. His chemistry with Emma Stone is quite strong (surely helped by the fact that they are now dating in real life) and their relationship is far more heartfelt than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's in the Raimi movies (although they were unfortunately never able to do anything as iconic as the upside down kiss in Spider-Man 2002). The visual effects and cinematography work together to give the film an almost cartoony vibe. This is not a bad thing: seeing Spider-Man swing around NYC has never been so fun, and the humorous camera angles often employed give us a real appreciation for what it must feel like to be the famous web-slinger. Hans Zimmer's score is surprisingly strong. Three major themes are easily noticeable, the first being a new Spider-Man theme that, while unnecessarily replacing James Horner's theme from TASM, is nonetheless given several rousing performances that are sure to cement the theme into the minds of all the fans of these movies. I would welcome Zimmer to return to TASM3 if he wishes to continue his work on the franchise.<br/><br/>Overall, TASM2 was one of the most exciting superhero movies I've experienced in theaters, and it had the thematic and intellectual clout to back up the eye candy. While the meta factors governing its production and existence are all troublesome, the movie transcends all that nonsense to give a rousing and highly recommended viewing experience. 8/10"
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","6","2","8","2 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Review
","My Thoughts: <br/><br/>I have to say that this was one of the movies I have been looking forward to since the end of the first The Amazing Spider-Man. So let us just delve into what we are getting in the sequel.<br/><br/>It has been a couple of months since the end of the first movie and Spidey is doing is thing saving the average citizens. Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy are graduating High School and moving forward in their lives. Though Peter is still plagued by the promise he made to Gwen's dad at the end of the first movie. This movie focuses a lot on the Peter/Gwen storyline and if you are a fan of the comics or just know Spidey lore you will understand why this is such a big focus in this movie. Even with the necessity of this storyline I think that the movie focuses to much on it at times and slows down the pace of the movie, it is over two hours long.<br/><br/>The big concern going into this movie is that it was going to be overburden with villains al la Spider-Man 3. To me this was not the case. The first villain we get introduced to is Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) who along with some of his companions are robbing a Oscorp truck when Spidey comes and saves the day. We don't see Aleksei again until towards the end of the movie when he is recruited by Mr. Fierce.<br/><br/>The second villain and really the main guy in this movie is Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx). I am sad to say this but seeing the origin story of Electro made me think of Selina Kyle/Catwoman in Batman Returns they just added electricity and bio-engineered eels which somehow effect Max and change him into the villain Electro. Once you get passed that though I have to say Electro is awesome, they are taking the Electro from the Ultimate 'verse and the end battle is one not to be missed.<br/><br/>The third villain we get in this movie is Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. Harry comes back into town to see his father before he passes away. It seems that the Osborn family have a genetic curse which we heard about in the first movie. Remember Doc Connors was working on trying to find a cure for Norman Osborn. Norman tells his son about the curse and passes on all his knowledge that he has accumulated over the years. Harry comes to find out that his best friends father was working with his father to try to find a cure using spiders. Harry puts two and two together and figures out that Spider-Man is the result of that research and figures that if he uses Spidey's blood that might save him from the curse. Lets just say that things don't go well and Harry dons the green armor to become Green Goblin.<br/><br/>We do get a Stan Lee cameo and it is alright not the best one that he has done though.<br/><br/>From all I have read on the internet there is suppose to be an Easter Egg in the credits but for some reason we did not get anything at the screening i went to.<br/><br/>My Recommendation: <br/><br/>Even though it may seem like I have a lot of complaints about this movie it is still a good movie. It is not on Captain America 2 level but this is an enjoyable Summer movie with some great action scenes. I have to say I didn't find it great watching in 3D."

","When The Amazing Spider Man (2012) released, people's mind was set that this is just another movie which sparks the Spider Man series reboot and the movie contradictory to its title did not have much amazement in it expect for the new lead pair of Andrew Garfield playing Spider-Man/Peter Parker and Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy. This movie ended up with Spider-man saving the city from an epidemic infection sparkled off by Dr. Kurt Connors/Reptile/The Lizard. Well The Amazing Spider Man 2 (2014) sparks off from where its forerunner left and ends with a good note for all leaving with some shocking surprises and twists.<br/><br/>The movie opens up Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) doing a self video recording about a major conspiracy which has been running in Oscorp and also shows us why Peter's parents had abandoned him during his childhood leaving Aunt May (Sally Field) to take care of him and also keep the secrets intact. In the present time, Spider Man has become the foster for New York as their Crime Fighter and Savoir of justice when needed and on the other edge Peter Parker is keen on balancing a normal life along with his girlfriend Gwen and also trying to stay and move away from her for the promise which he had made to Gwen's father before he had passed away when trying to save Spider Man from the Reptile/The Lizard. Events get electrified when Spider-Man gets to meet head-on with Electro who happens to be Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), an Oscorp employed electrician who after meeting a fatal accident gets mutated with powers of absorbing, living in and unleashing electric power from various sources and is ready to wreck mayhem in the city. Then later Peter has to battle his friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), who turns into Green Goblin after injecting a so called cure to save his life only to know that it turns him the other way around and now wants Spider-Man as his cure for the same.<br/><br/>The movie keeps you hooked from start to end and director Marc Webb had done a efficient job not only in presenting the life of Spider-Man with action and drama, but also the life of Peter Parker who is shown battling his inner sanity to make sure that none of his kith and kin are endangered due to Spider-Man's vitality. The romantic/emotional scenes between Peter and Gwen have been portrayed perfect and they blend with the racy screenplay in such a way that they are related to all the events happening throughout the whole movie. Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, and Dane DeHaan play their roles to the best and their characters do not seem to cease at any point in the movie. Chris Cooper makes as small cameo appearance as Norman Osborn, father of Harry Osborn.<br/><br/>Nothing would be more eye catching in a superhero movie other than the Action Sequences and here too we get to witness some fiery and edge of seat action sequences powered by stunning Visual Effects. The battle confrontation scenes between Spider-Man and Electro happens to the main highlight of this movie, especially the raging climax fight sequence which takes place in the city's power grid. Needless to say, Hans Zimmer has done an admirable job with the Music and Background Score for this movie and made sure that each scene lives up its genre be it Action, Drama, Thrill and Emotions.<br/><br/>This movie might not be the very best to come in Spider-Man series from the Marvel Comic Universe, but on the whole is a Promising sequel for its predecessor and a satisfying movie for all Spidey Fans which ends up with note for a sequel to come with more web-slinging action. Stay till the end credits for a shocking surprise."

Dane Dehaan's Harry Osborn was creepy, but damn good. I know this is a short review, but the movie was really good. I personally prefer Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker. Emma Stone makes a great Gwen Stacy. Green Goblin's new glider was AWESOME. Dane Dehaan did a pretty good job with the character he was playing. Electro was awesome, and you did feel sorry for him BEFORE he became evil. Little old Max Dillon on his own made you feel sorry for. Although, I hated Paul's performance of the Rhino. The Rhino sucked. I thought he was gonna be awesome, but man, was I wrong. In my head, I skipped his scenes.This is about the best Spidey movie since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1."

","Amazing Spiderman 2 is crowded yet fun! <br/><br/>Alright! May 2nd 2014 is approaching towards us, it's the day when our friendly neighborhood Spiderman will be hitting the silver screen once again with its freshest sequel to his 2012's reboot ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"". I got my hands on the pirated copy of The Amazing Spiderman 2, few days back, it's available on the Internet. Yaikks! Piracy alert! Yup, I downloaded it because I couldn't resist. The promos were so compelling and consuming, I just wanted to quench my irresistible desire for the web slinging action.<br/><br/>This is not the first review on the Internet for this movie and people have called it ""perfunctory"", ""Waste of Time"" and ""Insipid"". But at the same time people have also given it glowing reviews calling it ""Inception of a great movie series"". I was blown away by the first Sam Raimi's Spiderman Movie and I was quite disappointed by the reboot that happened 2 years back. However, I think the director Mark Webb has hit the right spot this time. Andrew Garfield shines as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. The one thing that stands out in the focus light is the ACTION! It's just phenomenal, some of the scenes are breath-taking and you will be completely engaged when the Spiderman jumps and slings from one building to another while dodging a homing missile at the same time kick goons and showcasing his acrobatics before he lands on the ground!<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer, I was pretty sure that this movie is going to suck really bad as Electro is not something that fanboys would consider before Venom, Mysterio or Carnage but I was completely wrong. They've given Electro a fresh perspective, and the thing which really got me riled up for Electro was its presentation. I have one word for Electro's outlook ""COOL"", you will see its transparent skin under which the lightening is swimming and his eel like facial structure, everything about electro was a fit!<br/><br/>The trailers posed 3 villains, Electro, Hobgoblin ad Rhino. And when I saw it, I thought it's going to be a crowded movie and the story won't be able to do justice to all the villains due to time constraint. I won't say the movie is not crowded but its not congested due to many villains, its because of the dragging emotional plot of Peter Parker. The plot goes back and forth on the same family and love-angle topics so many times that you will start to feel hammered. They could have just removed extra emotional culmination points.<br/><br/>When it comes to super villains of this movie, in actuality, there is only one villain who got proper screen time, that's Electro. Rhino got the shortest, hobgoblin was hovering off-n-on. There are some really charismatic action scenes in this movie that every fanboy or even the fresh audience must watch. The action scenes are properly choreographed and they are long enough to consume the audience with almost nil shaky cams! Just an personal background - I have enormous hatred for unnecessary shaky cams during an action sequence, which are being used a lot these days to make it more engaging and I totally believe that it takes away the thunder of scenes and abundantly irritates the audience. Back to review - Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's chemistry felt organic. Spiderman's humor was an untouched subject in Sam Raimi series, but here it is evident and actually works perfectly! His quips will actually make you giggle at times. Jamie Foxx has done a spectacular job in being the Electro! By the end of the movie, you will also palpate the assembly of the ""Sinister Six"" in the story line for future films.<br/><br/>Verdict time! - The Amazing Spiderman is a fun movie to watch much better than its 2012 predecessor. The story could have been optimized and focused. There are sections of movie that will make you hate it, but the action scenes of this move will make you love it more! It's not going to be the best movie of 2014 but surely it is the beginning of something huge! I will call it ""Watchable without Ganja""."
"rickardptlarsson","2","4","23","22 August 2014"," Worse than Spiderman 3
","I really liked the first film in the reboot and was expecting a worthy sequel. I couldn't be more wrong. This train wreck of a film is the worst Spiderman movie, even worse than Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>Garfield does a decent job but Spiderman in this movie is just hanging out'. No struggles with the burden of being a superhero. No, he misses his dad but other than that being Spiderman just seems like any other job. No worries, except when it comes to doing laundry.<br/><br/>You never really care for anyone in this film, the romance is mostly just irritating and the movie just feels rushed. None of the relationships in this movie fells even remotely authentic.<br/><br/>The villains doesn't convince at all. Max becomes Electro, the big bad super villain, because he had an accident involving electricity and the fact that Spiderman forgot his name. Harry becomes Goblin because Spiderman won't give him his blood, something that might save Harry from dying when he is in his 50s. Two random acts transforms these ""ordinary"" characters to evil villains. Rhino is just laughable and embarrassing. Every villain is a missed opportunity. Electro is visually pleasing but that is all.<br/><br/>Something that hurts me more than this movie is the fact that someone got paid to write this. It's just a really bad script. The actors never ha a chance. And the directing... As I wrote before I think it seems rushed and doesn't really knows what it wants.<br/><br/>The only good thing is that it is visually really nice. That is until the big stand of between Spidey and Eletro. Then, it seems, they ran out of money. The CGI looks like a cut scene from a video game.<br/><br/>In summary: Rushed directing, bad acting (not the actors fault), cheesy and dumb dialog and a script that falls short on so many levels. The plot, if you can call it a plot, is just a bunch of random events thrown together with the hopes that it might work.<br/><br/>Sadly, it doesn't..."
"tendobear","1","5","32","10 December 2014"," Not-So-Amazing Spiderman
","Oh man, this was absolutely horrendous - even worse than the first one. The characters are paper-thin, the actors are terrible (except Jamie Foxx, more on that later), the lines are cringe-worthy and the story makes no sense at all. Oh, and it's also very, very clichéd; Peter finds his dad's secret lab in an abandoned subway line, he even needs a special coin to make it come up out of the train tracks! WTF??? The story has more holes than Spiderman's web, for example: how come Spiderman seems to be impervious to Electro's shocks? What does Peter actually do except for hanging around looking cool with his big hair and hipster style? What exactly was wrong with Harry? Peter's relationship with Harry Osborn is pretty random and rushed, but Harry somehow expects Peter to do everything in his power to help him. Dane DeHaan playing Harry is just a rehash of his character in Chronicle, but this time he's a spoilt rich kid who didn't get enough hugs as a child. Man, how I miss James Franco's Harry, I actually felt for Franco's Harry: he was likable and you totally felt his pain. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have absolutely no chemistry at all, despite them actually dating in real-life at the time the movie was made, if they're on-screen relationship is so flaccid, I can't imagine what their real one must be like! Their lines are probably the corniest, cheesiest tripe I've ever heard, every time they spoke I gagged! It's ""I love you"" every second word, they toss those words out so casually that they don't mean anything and lack impact. With Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker, you can actually feel his struggle precisely because he doesn't say he loves Mary Jane after every second word. This brings me to Peter Parker himself, Garfield plays him with such swagger, cockiness and bravado that I really don't like him, and I find it really difficult to root for him. Tobey's Peter was a fantastic balance of vulnerability, geekiness and determination that you can't help but cheer for him and you can relate to him. The one saving grace was Jamie Foxx's Electro character - we actually understand his plight and we feel for him; who hasn't ever been trampled on by everyone and wished you had the means to fight back? When he does become Electro, he's probably the coolest villain ever i.e; when he turns into pure electricity and disappears into a power socket. He's actually a very scary villain and I wish they kept him somehow instead of cooking up some bullsh*t way to kill him. Another note on cliché: the scientist who runs the institute for the criminally insane where they keep Electro is an over-the-top neo-nazi-scientist type, he's even German!"
"patrickmmc","3","4","24","23 August 2014"," Okay For A Day At The Movies
","I can't talk about the Amazing Spider-Man 2 without mentioning the first film of this new franchise and it's predecessors in the first franchise at the same time. The biggest disappointment I found with all of these films is that the origin and characteristics of Spider-Man and accompanying characters have been altered from those of the original comics.<br/><br/>In the original comics, Peter Parker was a college student working on a project that involved radio activity. During testing, a normal spider gets caught in the way of the radiation and then winds up biting Peter, causing him to transform into our hero. The spider then goes off and dies. Both of the new franchises have chosen to change the way that the spider becomes capable of transforming a person into a super-human. Furthermore, the original story eliminates the possibility of anyone else encountering the same circumstance. In the first and second stories, it's feasible that other people could be bitten and become super-human just like Peter. In fact, in this film of the second franchise, they use this possibility to create the Green Goblin which is another character origin alteration and disappointment.<br/><br/>As far as it goes, the first franchise stayed closest to the original story line with one significant difference being that our new Spider-Man could spin webs directly from his wrists. In the original story, Peter, being a science major, had to develop web shooters to enhance his new physical capabilities. The shooters depended on web fluid cartridges and this was part of his limitations during villain battles. In both franchises, this fact was either significantly altered or just omitted.<br/><br/>Casting in both franchises had it's ups and downs. In the first franchise, I wasn't sure about Toby McGuire as Spider-Man. Surprisingly, in the first film, I thought he did exceptionally well. I can't say as much for the second and third installments. The whole emotional break-down he goes through in each felt ridiculous and painful. As for the other characters portrayed in the first installment, I thought a really good job was done in the first movie, but the follow ups weren't as well received.<br/><br/>In the second franchise we have Peter Parker/Spider-Man played by Andrew Garfield. Garfield is a taller, thinner and more confident character in contrast with McGuire. Though I wasn't too sure how to accept him in this role, all in all, I thought he did pretty good as well. I definitely liked his improved confidence over McGuire's character, but I did have a hard time accepting his thinner physique.<br/><br/>This franchise uses Sally Field playing the role of Aunt May. To me, this was a big mistake as Sally just doesn't fit the bill of the original character from the comics. Neither her script or her appearance and persona worked for me. Rosemary Harris was a far better Aunt May in the first franchise.<br/><br/>In the first film of this franchise, I thought the Lizard was done well. I can't remember his comic origin, but I liked the character and the effects used to bring him to life.<br/><br/>In this film, I can't say that I liked any of the villains. Again, big alterations to their origins and or characteristics where executed. Electro's character from origin to end was cheesy to say the least. The Rhino was majorly ridiculous and completely altered from the original comics. In this story Rhino is turned into a man in a robotic suit. This was nothing like the original where he was simply large, powerful and fast and wore a protective suit that looked like a rhino. In fact, in both franchises, the choice to alter villain costumes for the Goblin and the Rhino into metallic and/or robotic suites was again an unwanted disappointment.<br/><br/>I could go on and on comparing the two franchises and knit-picking them for their shortcomings. However, its best to say that I was impressed with both at the start. Unfortunately, as with the first franchise and its follow-ups to the first film, I wasn't terribly excited with the second installment in this latest franchise. It was okay for a day at the movies, but it isn't a film I will want to see over and over again.<br/><br/>Before closing this review, there is one thing I would like to add. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm growing rather tired of seeing Stan Lee do his little cameo appearances in every one of the Marvel films. It only increases the cheese factor."
"generationofswine","3","3","16","19 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","Return of the Spider-Bully.<br/><br/>They just couldn't capture Spider Man's personality in these films. Or rather they captured it for the Millennial attitude rather than how Spider-Man has ever been written.<br/><br/>In both Amazing Spider-Man movies, he mocks and openly ridiculous and belittles the people he's fighting. He bullies them from low rent thieves to the Big Bads.<br/><br/>That isn't how Spider-Man has ever acted save for when he was possessed by Venom in the comics.<br/><br/>True, he has always had a mouth on him, he's always been comical and run off at the mouth, but it's never been to belittle his opponent. Spider-Man has never been a bully.<br/><br/>The depiction in these two reboots tend to take the sense of humor of the guy in high school that shoved nerds into lockers.<br/><br/>There is a marked difference in the attitude and humor portrayed in Garfield's Spidey and the more true to form Spider-Mans of both Tobey and Holland.<br/><br/>There is a maliciousness here, in the Amazing Spider-Man movies that I just can not get behind as a fan of the character. He gloats when he takes down people weaker than him.<br/><br/>It leaves a bad taste in the mouth and should for any loyal fan of the Web-Slinger both in the movies and in the comic books."

","So I watched this movie yesterday with my friends. I did not have high expectations, although I did like the original Spider-man trilogy. What further lowered my expectations was the fact that all my friends told me that the prequel was terrible (which I was fortunate enough not to have seen). But little was I prepared for what I was going to see. It was more that two hours of trying to decide whether I should laugh or cry at how terrible the film was. I admit, I was somewhat entertained by the movie trying to take itself so serious, but ultimately failing miserably.<br/><br/>OK, let's see what made it so horrible... pretty much everything. The whole character of Electro was a bad joke, I feel. I kind of understand that nowadays all the villains have to be born by being bitten by genetically modified radioactive eels/spiders/etc. or falling into some high-secret supermachine; but then his motive being Spiderman not remembering his name and protecting the citizens from his wrath? What. I also feel the lightning effects did not look as good as could be expected considering nowadays' CGI technologies (it might be just me, though). I almost think the whole movie would have been much better had the whole Electro line been omitted. I didn't like Spider-man's character, either—him behaving as a cool guy, humiliating his enemies wherever he can. He is supposed to be a withdrawn boy whose goal is to save NY from the villains and not make a show of defeating them. I believe those scenes were meant to be funny, but not only were they not, they also destroyed Peter Parker's image. After all this, Harry's character almost seemed acceptable. Almost.<br/><br/>The plot was dumb, the dialogues were empty, but honestly many of the fight scenes were even worse. They were so ridiculous while trying to look serious that I literally buried my head into my popcorn several times. And then at the and came Rhino...<br/><br/>I feel sorry for the actors/actresses involved in this movie, they really did a decent job, and also for anyone who had nothing to do with the directing/story-writing, for having to contribute to this. The whole concept was so terrible it could not have been saved even if every character had been played by a Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>After the film, my friends said the first installment was even worse, and I was like, ""Really? Is that even possible?"" I'm trying to think of a film worse than this, and there is literally none I can remember. I don't know if I have ever rated a film 1/10 (probably not), but after seeing this, I feel I should re-rate them to at least 5/10 so as to keep proportions.<br/><br/>To anyone planning to watch this: if you like superhero movies in general, you can give it a try, although I think every single film in this particular genre has been better than this in the last 10 years. (But, you know, different tastes and stuff, so you might like it.) However, if you are not particularly fond of such films, you should not, under any circumstances, watch it, expecting an enjoyable two and a half hours."

"utgard14","6","2","9","30 June 2014"," Would Have Been So Much Better Without Jamie Foxx
","Good but not great sequel that manages to improve upon some things but, like the first movie, still has quite a few bugs. First, the good. Peter is far more likable in this movie. He's fun, he cracks more jokes, and seems more in line with the way Spider-Man should be portrayed. The cast is mostly solid. Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Sally Field all return from the first movie and shine. Dane DeHaan is very good as Harry Osborn, although the movie would have been better served with just him as the villain and giving him more screen time to build up his relationship with Peter. The action is much improved over the first movie, with some very impressive sequences that stand out. I can't recall a notable action scene from the first movie. I also loved the ending to this one. It was perfect.<br/><br/>Now, the bad. Let's start with friggin' Electro, played by Jamie Foxx. Ugh what kind of crap is this? I wonder if this is yet another case of the studio forcing them to add another villain to the movie, afraid audiences would be bored otherwise. Foxx's performance is embarrassingly bad. He seems like he would be more at home in a Joel Schumacher Batman movie. They also give him goofy music in the first part of the film like Otis from Superman (78). Terrible. I hated the look of the character, as well. All too often Hollywood's crappy designers think they can improve upon costumes and appearances of characters from comic books that have lasted for decades. Well, they're wrong 99% of the time and here Electro is yet another example of that. Not to mention Rhino, but I'll let that slide. The video game climax was a bit much, with the CGI Spider-Man looking so cartoony I thought the movie had turned into an animated film for awhile. Lastly, something I didn't like from this or the first movie is the stupid plot involving Peter's parents. I don't think it was necessary and ultimately added very little to either movie.<br/><br/>I still recommend the movie because parts of it are excellent and overall the movie works, despite the problems with Foxx and some of the other issues. It strikes a nice balance between light and dark, even better than the first movie did. I just wish they wouldn't keep thinking that superhero sequels had to have multiple villains, especially cheesy ones."
"jjkaiohken","9","2","9","12 May 2014"," Only described as Amazing
","Last day it was my birthday, and I went to the cinema with my friends and we watched The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Due to all the mixed or negative critics that the second Marc's Webb adaptation to the cinema of the superhero had received, I didn't have any special expectation. When the movie started, I felt nervous, and when it finished, I felt at ease with it. I think that it's the best Spider-Man movie ever made, even before those marvelous Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 of the Sam Raimi's trilogy. Personally, my favorite hero is Batman, so I'm used to that kind of dark and gloomy superhero. And this has been the first time that I really enjoyed watching a funny superhero in action, excepting Kick-Ass'. Tobey Maguire was a good election for the character, but soon he became a boring interpretation of Peter Parker (you can see a good example in his continuous debates with Aunt May or Mary Jane, a character that I never liked, and his stupid 'bad guy' actuation in Spider-Man 3, the worst movie in my opinion). I liked him, but Andrew is the real Peter Parker. Shy with girls, funny , clever and always clumsy. The special effects of the new feature film are outstanding, as well as his slow motion 'Spider Sense' sequences, a thing that I think Sam Raimi used as less as possible in his trilogy. Emma Stone brings a new kind of girl that we could discover in The Amazing Spider-Man, but we can feel in this new film. There is not an overabundance of characters. Instead of that, the screenplay plays with a lot of different histories, so that the effect caused is similar to the one is Love Actually. You cannot get bored with this film! The villains, both Electro and the Green Goblin are better created than the ones in other films, like that awful Venom, the ridiculous Sandman and the boring Lizard. This film, in my opinion is the best of the saga. I can just say that it deserves at least an 8 out of 10, and from there going up. Better than Sam Raimi's saga, Captain America The Winter Soldier and The Amazing Spider-Man. Worst than The Dark Knight Trilogy, by Christopher Nolan. Thanks."
"saytosandeep","8","2","9","6 May 2014"," MY REVIEW: The Amazement Continues!!
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I always find Andrew Garfield (smart, witty and funny) and Emma Stone (beautiful, smart and charming) better replacement to Tobey Maguire (a bit dull) and Kirsten Dunst (nagging and crying). These two make whole and soul of Mark Webb's version of Spider-man engaging and more enjoyable. Whenever you see these two leads sharing scorching chemistry, the screen just lights up. This movie uses the advance technological geniuses in Spider-man's flight scenes and action scenes and awesome 3D adds icing to the cake. Dane DeHaan as Green Goblin or Harry Osborn gives a chilling performance and he will be the one to watch out for in next movie in the series. But this amazing experience does not end on a high note. Last 20 minutes into the movie and you are given as many as three climaxes to absorb. Jamie Foxx playing Electro is not given right finish. Rhino makes a very late entry. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Amazing Spider-man 2. Despite its over stretched climax, this one makes a terrific superhero movie experience because of its casting and enjoyable characters."
"viceroy_88","8","2","9","6 May 2014"," A very successful reboot sequel
","The Amazing Spider-Man has become a successful sequel of Marvel's Spider-Man reboot.<br/><br/>Even though it continues the legacy of the previous movie that follows the original story from the comics, director Marc Webb still makes some necessary deviations. He said, ""There are times where we feel obligated to follow the source material, and there are times where we feel the need to deviate from it.""<br/><br/>However, personally this thing doesn't really bother me. Spider-Man's costume, especially the eyes, is made more similarly to the original comic costume, unlike the other Spider-Man movies.<br/><br/>I really like the villains that are made using combinations of Marvel Comics universe and Ultimate Marvel universe. Electro appears with the background story as in Marvel Comics, but with costume from Ultimate Marvel. Green Goblin is also a mutant as in Ultimate Marvel, even though still keeps his glider from Marvel Comics. Rhino also appears at the end with background story as in Marvel Comics, but without superpowers, rather wearing some kind of iron suit from Ultimate Marvel.<br/><br/>As the biggest film production ever made in New York City, this movie entertains viewers with cool metro cityscapes, supported by good visual effects.<br/><br/>I also like the cinematography, which made me feel the sensation of falling free from such heights when Spidey swings between skyscrapers, that is the sensation of having butterflies in my stomach.<br/><br/>Dub step music that plays during Electro scenes is quite enjoyable too.<br/><br/>I certainly like Andrew Garfield more, because he can portray Spider-Man's playful and naughty characteristics, unlike Tobey Maguire's nerd, crybaby, and stupid persona. And of course Emma Stone's superb acting, even as Gwen Stacy, she can create a likable chemistry in their romance, one that can touch your heart, unlike that between Peter and MJ in previous Spider-Man trilogy, which honestly get on my nerves.<br/><br/>The appearance of three villains in this movie does not feel too heavy or too rushed. I know that Electro is the main villain, that Spidey's fight with the Green Goblin is very short. But in fact, there are some scenes that are cut to be able to make it for PG-13 rating. Very different with Spider-Man 3 which also features three villains, but the movie feels too fast and forced.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"
"kraftova-daniela","8","2","9","27 April 2014"," Mixed feelings but still a must-see!
","I have kinda mixed feelings about it. I have read the comics, so I knew what was going to happen to Gwen but that didn't prepare me at all. Also, till the very last moment before the Goblin appeared, I was hoping maybe they'll do that in the next movie. Anyway, I cried like a baby, the scene was beautifully done, although I do remember it happening on a bridge (them standing on that bridge was the reason I started crying like 20 minutes before the actual falling scene). But aside from the Peter/Gwen plot line, I didn't enjoy the Electro one. Jamie Foxx's done a great job but I just didn't like the story very much. And I absolutely hated what they did to Harry. He wasn't supposed to be the one who kills Gwen. I never saw him as a villain, he was always like the guy who could be somehow redeemed. But this version of him, nope, he's far too gone. I wish they had done it at least like... showing more of Peter and Harry's friendship, them hanging out with Gwen and MJ on double dates and all that but I didn't even get that. On top of that, I wasn't really happy with the choice of the actor either. But I'm giving 8 stars for Emma, Andrew and Jamie's performances, the death scene mainly, and of course for Spidey's witty one-liners."
"jhortz98","7","2","9","27 April 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","I'll start by saying that I am a big fan of Spidey, I'm a big comic book fan and love going to the cinema to watch the Superhero/Comic Book films to see if they are accurate to their source material, and I can honestly say, although it isn't fully accurate, it had a great Comic Book feel to it.<br/><br/>From the off the film answers a few questions from the previous instalment, and all the way through it is a roller-coaster ride of emotion, with great jokes and awesome action. The story is strong, with the Web-Slinger facing some of his most formidable characters such as Electro and Rhino.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant all the way through, Andrew Garfield is sublime, you can tell he loves being the character, and I love him being the character, he looks like Peter Parker and captures his sarcastic and cheeky side. Tobey Macguires Peter Parker hasn't got a scratch on Andrew's. Emma Stone is great as Gwen Stacey and Jamie Foxx plays Electro/Max Dillon with great confidence.<br/><br/>A big thing for me was the Music, I love film scores and Hans Zimmer and The Magnificent Six have done this film justice, especially with the tracks The Rest of My Life, You're That Spider Guy and I Need to Know, it sounds unbelievable in the cinema, it really does. <br/><br/>Although many people will either say it is to childish or colourful, or they'll say it wasn't dark enough, Spider-Man isn't necessarily a dark character, he is a lovable young adult who has a younger, cheeky side to him and a serious, think about the consequences side and it is clear throughout this film.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is an enjoyable and thrilling Comic Book film that is loosely based on the source material, of which i do not want to name as the title will completely give it away, but what it lacks in the screenplay department, it makes up for in the acting and the heart- breaking scenes and breath-taking action. It is clear at the end of the movie their will be another one and it hopefully it will be as action- packed as this one. <br/><br/>This film is a must see for all ages, Comic Book fan or just a Movie lover, and I will definitely be singing its praises for many years to come, awesome film!!!"
"adwright100-31-166862","7","2","9","27 April 2014"," Spiderman as he should be seen
","Well the boy spider struts his funky webs all over again and well, it was okay. You know me, a super-hero tart, my inner fourteen year old usually laps this stuff up (see my review of Winter Solider here) but Spidey, both in this incarnation and in the Tobey Maguire juggernaut, leaves me a little cold. Of course I'm being churlish. The visuals are incredible, the script sparkles, the acting is excellent. The 3D worked harder here, but it should really with the subject matter. <br/><br/>The film opens with the familiar spider logo flexing on the screen as it becomes part of Spidey's suit as he plummets to the New York streets webs a-flying! Amazing. The story's good too, deeper than previously, but Spidey is still basically a teenager and precisely the things that appeal to that demographic put me off. The macho Roger-Moore-as-James-Bond patented good guy banter that punctuates the comics is here too, undermining the visuals and the reality - (yes I know it's a story about a boy bitten by a radioactive spider so it's not meant to be real!). When you're flying about trying to pick up lots of bouncing glass vials of plutonium would you really joke with the bad guy driver of the stolen truck? A suspension of disbelief too far - perhaps Spiderman just needs to secure it with a bit of his web.<br/><br/>Andy Garfield gives a much more emotionally nuanced Spiderman and Emma Stone does a great job of being the sassy, clever and kick-arse heroine - she certainly has more dimensionality than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson in the nerdier Tobey Maguire re-boot. Sally Field is a better Auntie May as is Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, in fact the acting is seriously up a gear in this new re-boot with Jamie Foxx as Electro and Dane DeHaan as a slow-burning Green Goblin. But it still doesn't emotionally grip or have that slantways satirical lilt of the Avenger Assemble or Iron Man. And I think that's it, I love a Marvel superhero movie but I do like the satire, the great one- liners, the gentle mickey take of itself. Spidey's bad guys darknesses are undeveloped and untwisted, yes I know they're that way in the comics too. I want darker, nastier and altogether more conflicted bad guys I think and the Spidey Universe seems a little too simple. <br/><br/>But The Amazing Spiderman 2 is brilliant entertainment with wondrous effects and explosions and lots of running, leaping and jumping. The little kid who used to watch the Spiderman cartoons as a kid on ITV would have totally loved it. Spiderman as a concept totally loved, brilliantly brought to the screen and envisaged, as good as this particular franchise gets. It is just that the original comic book didn't really delve into the depths like some of the other characters in Marvel. <br/><br/>Does this lukewarm review mean I'm finally growing up? God, I hope not.<br/><br/>(Four stars ****)"
"boofa1995","7","2","9","25 April 2014"," The Fairly Amazing Spiderman
","*Second warning (in case you somehow missed the first one), this review contains some BIG SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Excited as I was for this instalment, I couldn't help but maintain my usual level of scepticism upon entering any comic-based movie. In all honesty though, I left the movie thoroughly content. Went through the entire movie without checking my phone once (that's a a good sign).<br/><br/>The story was great. While there were some moments I thought were a little slow, as whole I think they did pretty well. I was pleasantly surprised with the back story of his parents, as well as his father's video. I thought Gwen's speech (both at the start and the end) were very well integrated, but most of all... I'm so happy with what happened to Gwen. It was almost identical to what actually happened in the comics (which I always appreciate a film adaptation doing), and it sets up a new love interest (*cough* MJ *cough*) for the next film. It truly evoked emotions from me at the time (and for days after), and it just made me glad that a Marvel film FINALLY decided to take a darker turn for once. The soundtrack was absolutely stellar - not a surprise from Hans Zimmer, really. From a person that has analysed movie soundtracks countless times, I can say that the integration of music in this film was a big step up from the last one. I also thought the running theme of time was extremely relevant to the movie's story, and (cliché as it may have been) I found the way that the movie ended was a perfect way to finish.<br/><br/>However, the film was not without its flaws. I thought the acting (excluding Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan and Andrew Garfield as Spiderman) was pretty standard for a superhero movie. I was disappointed with the limited amount of screen-time Green Goblin received. Also, I found the character development of Electro to be extremely typical and cliché at times. If you're picky about copying, the movie DOES resemble parts of Spiderman 2/3 of the previous trilogy, but I personally think this is irrelevant, as it's an entirely new quadrilogy separate from any previous films.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this movie is definitely worth a watch. While it may not be the best Marvel movie of the year (GO WATCH CAPTAIN 'MERICA), I'd definitely recommend it."

","The worst Spider-Man movie by far, but it's a little weird how it's way more entertaining that the first Amazing Spider-Man just because of how laughably bad a lot of stuff in this movie is. Honestly if I'm being fair, I'd rather choose to rewatch this movie again that the first one, it's just because that it kind of manages to be funny unintentionally the whole way through from the god awful score, the laughable villains, the acting, characters and the convoluted script. The worst Spider-Man movie, there is nothing much to say really, except the fact that it's hilarious.

I also can't stand how villains are portrayed. Rhino was completely useless, Electro was a joke, and words can't describe how bad Harry is as both himself and as the greed goblin.

These two are my saving grace for the film, the chemistry between the two was superb, snapping between fun chit-chat to romantic interests was easily the biggest strength of the movie. <br/><br/>With that being said, Spider-Man is about the VILLAINS, with such a wide universe of material and villains to choose from Sony opted to go with Max Dillon a.k.a Electro, with Jamie Foxx leading the role. Foxx is chilling as Max, he is twisted, disturbed and straight up weird, unfortunately his performance as Electro isn't quite as impressive ... There are some great scenes involving Spider-man and Electro specifically the Times Square sequence, but his character is let down by some awfully cheesy dialogue, ""It's my birthday, time to light the candle"" *cringe* <br/><br/>But aside from this scene there isn't much more of them both. This leads on to the films biggest weakness, it's convoluted plot. Director Marc Webb tries to set up an entire Spider-Man universe by creating plot points which will be resolved in future films in one film. This makes the movie seem as just a prelude of what is to come, Harry Osborne and Peter barely get any development as friends and instead become sworn enemies by the end.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't a 'bad' film like some people say ... It definitely isn't Spider-Man 3! In fact it's far from it, a couple of key issues revolving plot and villain let the film down, but it is still a fun experience."

Jamie Foxx also did an excellent job playing Electro. His acting wasn't the only I found intriguing, I was also fascinated by the way he looked with his static blue body made of electricity than how he looked in the comics.<br/><br/>The movie had a much darker tone than the first one.

While the pieces are each awesome, the selections loose consistency to one another. Maybe that's the point because the story is brilliant and as the characters experience victory and defeat, so does the music.<br/><br/>The opening piece is fantastic where the modern meets the ""trad"" world and both work together resulting in artistry on the output channel. Then here come the trendy club sounds, glitches and other effects that over saturate the current market for video gamers and midnight dancers.<br/><br/>A beautiful sound design could have joined these styles together, but this is what is missing in this film as the score simply goes from one piece to the next.

Sure there is much excitement, action and story line, but it gets buried in too many branches of the Spiderman myth. Andrew Garfield returns as Spider-Man / Peter Parker and Emma Stone is Gwen Stacy his girlfriend. Theirs is a cursed relationship but they do try and hold it together with a lot of web action sequences. In addition, a new villain, Jamie Foxx appears as Electro who I think was a waste of great talent as the director cloaked him behind way too much makeup which we lose during his transformation. However were it not for the dark settings, audiences could keep track of it all. The best part of this movie is the reappearance of Stan Lee, the creator of the Marvel characters. Sally Field also returns as Aunt May Peter Parker's remaining relative.

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 <br/><br/>The problem with killing a radioactive human/arachnid hybrid is it rains for, like, 6-weeks straight.<br/><br/>Luckily the wall-crawler in this action movie is hard to squash.<br/><br/>Concerned that his actions as Spider-Man could jeopardize Gwen (Emma Stone), Peter (Andrew Garfield) breaks things off with her.<br/><br/>To keep his mind occupied, he bonds with Aunt May (Sally Fields) and battles with Rhino (Paul Giamatti), Electro (Jamie Foxx) and the Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan).<br/><br/>And while fate ultimately brings Peter and Gwen back together, it also heralds Spider-Man's greatest loss.<br/><br/>Although it's bloated on villains, this sequel is the closest to the character this franchise has come.<br/><br/>Garfield's bogus Brooklyn accent notwithstanding, his sinewy stature and breezy banter evokes Marvel's mascot better than his predecessor.<br/><br/>What's more, its treatment of the infamous Gwen Stacy storyline is longwinded but laudable.<br/><br/>However, nothing is more humiliating than a super-hero walking his girlfriend's teacup Chihuahuas. <br/><br/>Green Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"

","In this installment spider man is against several villains and the struggle with them changes his life.the story has improved in so many ways form the first movie,where the story gives more character to spider man where it shows that spider man is more human and not just a comedic character which resulted from the first movie. as in every spider man movie special effects play a major role,and this movie takes it to the next level.it's such a delight to enjoy the special effect of the movie because it's truly amazing. also the movie maker has created some really good characters which really improved the quality of the story.Andrew Garfield give a good performance with a blend of comedy and drama.a special mentioned should be made to Dane DeHaan who plays Harry Osborn, provides a amazing performance with good character development.Jamie Foxx provides a good villain to the story .one negative side is that the use of Paul Giamatti ,where not much screen time is given to his character and hopefully he will become a part of future spider man projects. overall good movie ,good special effects ,good acting and a proper story and it has resulted a enjoyable spider man movie."

","I regret not seeing this in theatr so much now because i think This movie was really a big step Forward in the new spider-man series , it wasn't perfect for sure no movie is , i mean they could'v worked more on the suit , and some other little details here and there. Gwen's death was a kinda surprise , but if you look to the whole movie you'll see that it's a great combination of reality , visual effects which was outstanding and lot of emotions, and also a good acting , i think the makers did an awesome job taking this marvel character to a new level which makes the expectations higher on the next one . anyway am not an expert or something but that s what i think of the movie."

This movie on the other hand sucks at all levels from direction to acting (except visual effects). TASM2 has no proper storyline, and the worst part is they talk too much about science and every character seems to defy gravity during action sequences until the end of movie when Gwen Stacy dies due to massive trauma. The movie makers will need a good story from MARVEL comics , Sam Raimi as director and a Physics teacher, if they want to have a sensible 3rd sequel."

","Spiderman 2 is effectively 6 films crammed into 1 and done so poorly that the agenda and explanation for the villains hate for spiderman is often bewildering and laughable.<br/><br/>-Spontaneous crowd cheers spiderman > Spiderman must die! -Spiderman won't randomly give blood > Spiderman must die! -Spiderman got men arrested whilst I was committing a crime> Spiderman must die!<br/><br/>Its just nonsensical how simplistic the film is designed and a clear attempt to force out a foundation for a sinister-6 film that obviously won't be made now.<br/><br/>As usual we have the typical pandering to the female non-fans, with an arbitrary 'will they - wont they' love story, albeit an absurdly rocky one despite practically nothing happening inbetween their scenes to justify the 'keep her - leave her'switches that happen at least 5 times..<br/><br/>The acting i'm sure was OK, although its hard to comment when you have all of the above issues loudly shouting over the dialogue. They probably did what they could, is probably the best I can comment with..<br/><br/>The graphics were good enough, the standard marvel quality, but graphics just don't make up for a rushed story crammed with too many people, too many plots and too little time to justify their existence..<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film wasn't a good spiderman film. Perhaps if it was 3-6 separate films I'd be inclined to watch, but the rushed quality, poor pacing and overall pointlessness of it all makes it a film best left alone.<br/><br/>2/10"
"Mr-Fusion","3","3","20","9 January 2015"," What a waste
","I don't remember the first movie being all that bad, aside from misguidedly dark. It had a decent cast, one central villain, and told the origin story in a standard by-the-book fashion. But that all goes out the window with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti and Dane DeHaan range from questionable to god awful. When you have one bad apple in your group, it's an acting issue. But half your cast? What happened in two years that Marc Webb suddenly can't direct? Foxx and Giamatti, it's gotta take work to get something bad out of these guys! The other major problem is that they throw everything (kitchen sink, too) into the story. There is a *lot* going on here: three villains, Gwen's Oxford drama, the mystery of Peter's parents, two (almost) crashing planes. One bad guy's enough. If you're good, maybe two. This has three, one of whom is the Green Goblin. Again. Can we drop it with this guy already? <br/><br/>It's top-heavy, not epic. Between the plot points and the noise, disorienting effects (I did not watch this on the big screen) and gaps in logic (Why is Electro miffed at Spidey?) this is an overlong train wreck.<br/><br/>3/10"
"joetufano882","3","3","20","6 January 2015"," Spidey deserves better
","I've been a Spidey fan since I first watched the 2002 film, read the comics in the years that followed, played the games, etc. I was pretty disappointed when the reboot was announced, but I decided to give it a shot. While I did like it at first, as time has gone by and having watched it a few more times I wasn't really impressed like a lot of people were. Despite that, I was willing to give the sequel a chance. However the stuff they showed in the trailers, and news updates about the plot (or lack thereof I should say), I was worried that it was looking too much like Spider-Man 3 all over again. And the movie doesn't deserve a pass for Emo Peter not being in here. Not to mention that Sony really went overboard on the marketing campaign, and spoiled the entire movie in the previews. My fears turned out to be true: this is SM3 all over again! <br/><br/>I've never been a fan of Andrew Garfield's portrayal of the character, and I think his performance is massively overrated by a lot of people. So many people practically worship his performance to point where I'm incredibly sick of it at this point. He's not bad in the role, but I fail to see how he gets A+ reviews from people just because of his resemblance to Ultimate Spidey, some stupid web shooters, and that he cracks a few jokes in costume. Plus his behavior in this film feels more like the complete opposite of Peter Parker. He wouldn't high five the principle and kiss Gwen in front of the whole school like he's the popular kid. And he wouldn't flaunt around the fact that he's a superhero by doing an acrobatic climb over a ledge in a public park when you're not in costume and use his own theme song as his ring tone. It feels like Garfield is just playing himself in and out of the Spider- Man suit. And yes I'm gonna say it, I'll take Tobey Maguire over Andrew Garfield ANY day of the week. <br/><br/>As for the romance? All I hear people say is, ""Garfield and Stone have wonderful chemistry"". Another example of stupid worship these movies keep getting. Garfield and Stone are good together, but they don't have great chemistry in terms of believable characters. I know that there's couples out there that do this, but do any of us really want to watch something like this in movie form? I don't. The relationship is so obnoxious because Peter and Gwen keep going back and forth with each other and the movie rushes through the whole thing by a certain point that at the end, that I didn't feel like he learned anything from it. At the end, he just carries on as normal like it never happened. Especially since it was Gwen's own fault that the Goblin killed her, and not Peter's which is how it's supposed to be. Her death being in this movie comes off as emotionally manipulative and it feels like the filmmakers and Sony only put in here to make the comic book fans happy. Same with Spidey joking every 3 microseconds, and the webshooters. I get that its meant to teach Peter about responsibility, but Uncle Ben's death is supposed to teach him that. Why should it take this many people dying for him to get the message? <br/><br/>And I find it insulting that these movies just threw Uncle Ben's death under the bus, and they practically just rushed the ending after Gwen's death with Peter coming off as he just shrugged off her death like it never happened. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is a great actor, but his performance as Max Dillon was just embarrassing to watch because he comes off as a psycho and I didn't find him that interesting as Electro either. And his reasons for hating Spider-Man is so ridiculous: seriously, you hate him because he forgot your name? Dane Dehaan's Harry Osborn is underwritten and not that interesting to watch because his character is literally shoehorned into the film to kill Gwen Stacy. And don't get me started on the Rhino... Not to mention how these characters mess with the movie's tone, coming off as more campy than the Raimi trilogy was and I felt like I was watching something similar to Joel Schumacher's Batman films. <br/><br/>The storytelling is so terribly executed: it's clogged up with so many plot points that go nowhere and the fan service in this film is only done just to make the comic book fans applaud as it appears. It even comes off as a giant commercial for not just the Sinister Six, but for Sony products. This film is a complete insult to the character, that it still astounds me when I see people praise this. <br/><br/>In light of recent movie news though, I'm relieved that some people are starting to wake up and realize why this current franchise is being made, and are championing for Marvel to get the rights back. I do hope Marvel is able to get Spidey back, because he deserves to be in good movies again like he was in 2002 and 2004."

","""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is a promising beginning in what looks to be, hopefully, another successful movie franchise and a most welcome antidote to the dreadful ""Twilight"" movies...<br/><br/>This opening salvo works on all cylinders. A good job was done by all parties involved given the movie's modest (by today's standards) budget. Emma Stone, Sally Field, Jamie Foxx and Felicity Jones round-up a good cast.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield though, truly is the centre piece of this movie. Without him as Emo Spiderman, I doubt that the movie would have been as good as it ended up being.<br/><br/>I have not read the comics, so this review is solely based on the movie itself. I found it strange that a lot of people bring up ""Harry Potter"" as the movie they most compare ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" with, but fail to also bring up Stephanie Meyers's novel ""Twilight"" or Hollywood's take on Battle Royale, ""The Hunger Game"". I rather think that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" has undertones of those stories, and that is a positive thing! Based on this first instalment, I will be in the theatre when the next chapter comes go the big-screen. I am not a huge fan, or an established one, since I have not seen the emoe Sam Raimi versions, but as an emo youth, I was not disappointed!"
"reedcom","5","3","20","18 October 2014"," Wow, I hated this
","Wow, I didn't think it was possible for me to hate a Spider-Man movie. This movie was so depressing. The was no sense of triumph in anything Spider-Man did. Peter would go around doing his Spider-Man thing with over the top cockiness, then the next minute in slow, depressing, relationship drama with Gwen, which took up most of the movie. Electro had about 15% of the movie, Green Goblin had about 5% of the movie, and Rhino was less than a minute. The villains had unrealistic motivations for what they did.<br/><br/>I didn't find myself caring about any of the characters. The music did not engage me. The major character deaths did not make me cry or feel for the characters. At least the acting and effects were good."
"bconnelly2014","3","3","20","6 October 2014"," They practically remade Spider Man 3
","They ended the original series after the 3rd movie went down as one of the worst sequels of all time and was greatly disliked and realized they had to start over. They did that in 2012 with The Amazing Spider-Man which wasn't amazing but it was still a decent movie with a superior cast then the original series but an inferior storyline generating mixed reviews amongst the public. Every superhero movie has an ending that will set up a sequel and for two years there has been a lot of hype about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and talk about what would happen knowing the storyline of the comic book series. <br/><br/>Marc Webb directed this one as he directed the first and he did a decent job as a director but however his writers did him a disservice and wrote him what is probably the equivalent of Spider Man 3 for the new series. A terrible sequel with too many story lines that felt completely unbalanced. Like Spider Man 3 there was too much attention on the romance and the fact that there was multiple villains in it that didn't get enough attention in the story and the villains were mostly bad. They had three villains in it just like Spider Man 3.<br/><br/>The story of Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) becoming Electro was completely unnecessary as it added nothing good to the film and in the end was pointless as it also even looked bad when he became Electro. So this guy named Max who works at Oscorp gets saved by Spider Man and then idolizes him for it then wants to kill Spider Man after a misunderstanding that occurred after the accident that turned him into Electro. Very lousy idea and it's surprising that Jamie Foxx who is an academy award winning actor would agree to play that part. If they took that part out of the story and just left all the focus to Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) that would have been way better. That story had potential but it wasn't given the amount of attention it needed. The story of how he is developing his father's illness and needs to save himself could have been really good if it hadn't been shadowed over the really terrible parts of the movie. They had to move through it too fast and they couldn't develop it more due to the fact that there were so many stories. He could have been a good villain if he were the only one. I also think the fact that Paul Giamiti is playing the Rhino is a little weird and I thought he looked cheesy. Knowing now that he will be in the next one doesn't give me high hopes for that one either. <br/><br/>This is a series that had so much potential considering the cast and how well Marvel has been doing but they are taking it in the wrong directions. These two have almost been like kids movies. They have been much cheesier then the last series. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone together are way better then Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst but if only they had been given good things to work with around them. The new series just isn't worth it and they can't perfect Spider man it seems. When they have good stories they get a bad cast but once they have a good cast they don't have good stories. Spider Man is also such a cool superhero and it's sad they haven't perfected it yet. It doesn't look like it will as this series has the potential to get worse as it goes along."

Let's put some effects, to fulfill our 225 million budget, so that film would be at least almost bearable to watch on blue-ray, if you fast-forward all scenes, where Garfield do the do soap-opera talking with his girlfriend. Let's ignore completely dumb human reactions, like why not run away from the security of your own company you're working in after just searching for a name of a fellow-employee? Why didn't the Spider-man JUST give his damn blood away? WHY did Parker become Harry Osborne's enemy after Spider-man refused to share his blood? Why everything is so far-fetched in this movie, you just want to puke? Puke all over this imbecile-super- hero-teen-love-drama? Why did this piece of a crap get 7+ rating on IMDb? Why does the 30mil District 9 feels way better in terms of visuals?<br/><br/>Anyway, I feel sorry for all those movie goers who actually LIKE it, as it is directly correlates to your IQ: the higher rating you give to this movie, the lower your IQ is."
"metalrage666","7","2","11","27 April 2014"," Quite enjoyable
","I must admit that I did not like the first of the Amazing Spiderman movies, however I really enjoyed this.<br/><br/>While the first movie seemed a hodge-podge of ideas amid CGI effects, I found that they appeared to have corrected a lot of that in this outing.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx plays Max Dillon an insecure, introverted technician at Oscorp and becomes obsessed with Spiderman when Spiderman saves his life. Being a virtual nobody his boss makes him stay overtime, on his birthday no less, and while doing maintenance work he accidentally falls into a vat full of electric eels, thus Electro is born. <br/><br/>Max is believed to be dead however while in the morgue the electricity that now runs through is body reanimates him. Spiderman and Electro finally cross paths whilst in Times Square as Electro tries to feed off the power cables that run under the road. The crowd panics and his image is suddenly on all the TV screens around the place. As Electro, Max now seems to be a somebody but he gets enraged when his image is replaced with Spidermans image.<br/><br/>Electro is quickly subdued when he's sprayed with a fireman's hose to temporarily neutralize his electrical power and is taken to a secure location within Oscorp for testing.<br/><br/>Harry Osborne makes his first appearance in this sequel and helps Electro escape when Harry's friend Peter and subsequently Spiderman won't agree to giving Harry any of Sipderman's blood which Harry believes will save his life as Harry is suffering from the same degenerative disease as his father. Harry finds out about Oscorps' secret projects and discovers that the venom from the genetically altered spiders that created Spiderman is being stored there.<br/><br/>Taking over the city's power supply Electro becomes stronger and takes on Spiderman one more time in an attempt to control the city's power supply via the new power grids that he himself designed. Meanwhile Harry injects himself with the spider venom believing it will cure him, yet it instead transforms him into the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Spiderman manages to destroy Electro by overloading him and shortly after the Green Goblin shows up and seeing Spiderman with Gwen, Harry works out that Spiderman is in fact Peter Parker. In the ensuing battle, Gwen falls from a clock tower and is killed.<br/><br/>Due to grief, Spiderman has seemingly given up and disappears from sight for many months and crime goes unchecked across the city. He eventually resurfaces due to a new menace called Rhino, who is a Russian criminal in a mechanical armoured suit supplied by Oscorp. The movie ends with Spiderman and Rhino doing battle on the city streets.<br/><br/>Overall I liked this sequel and it had much better character development. Jamie Foxx as Electro was awesome although completely altered from the comic adaptation and this version is more similar to his transformation as per the Spectacular Spiderman comic series. But regardless the movie is enjoyable, you don't need to know anything about the Marvel comic universe to enjoy it."
"hunter_reboul","3","3","21","19 August 2014"," Not enough Spiderman
","This was a disappointment for me. I got excited at the start with the opening scene. Then when Gwen and Peter had a conflict, I knew that this was going to go like Spider Man 3.<br/><br/>Sure enough, Peter gets all sad, and can't stop thinking about her, which takes up about half the movie.<br/><br/>The truth about his father would have been more interesting, if they didn't reveal it at the end. If they had shown the whole problem either in the middle or near the end, my review would have gotten a few more points.<br/><br/>Another point was we were told there would be three villains in this movie. But only one was there for long. One was their just so something very significant could happen, and the final one only showed up for 10 minutes, and was very stupid as well.<br/><br/>But here's my main problem. Not. Enough. Spiderman.<br/><br/>The two battles between Electro, although interesting, where too short. The first battle was mostly talking, because Electro was confused, and him being captured right away really bugged me. Then the second one happened too fast. Spiderman knew how to defeat him right away, and did it too fast as well. Green Goblins fight was also really fast. Finally, there was no fight at all with the Rhino. I wanted to be excited, but I just couldn't be. The parts that should have been exciting took too long to show up. By the time they did, I was bored.<br/><br/>Obviously, they've set up a sequel. I wish some facts in this movie could have been put in the third movie so this movie could have had more Spiderman. That being said, now that it's all out of the way, I'm hoping this next one is amazing. Because if it isn't, it will be the same damm thing as the original trilogy."

Sony had gone too far, leaving bad performances behind for audiences to see.<br/><br/>We got Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx as Electro, Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. The performances were really bad, really really bad, especially the villains. There's Paul Giamatti playing the Rhino and he was completely the worst. The screenplay is a total disaster. They were too easy and really childish. Emma Stone didn't take her role seriously on being Gwen Stacy, she's just...boring like ""Nobody makes my decision, I'm Gwen Stacy"" and she's dead. What a stupid decision. Another stupid part in here is Electro, the policemen were morons, complete idiots. They didn't even listen to Spider-Man saying that Max Dillon is a good guy. Even the crowd were complete morons as well. Are they deaf? Didn't they hear what their hero's trying to say? WTF!!! I hate those scenes. Jamie Foxx being Electro is hilarious, noting dark and evil.<br/><br/>The only things I liked about this movie is the costume. It's a lot better than the previous one, it's awful but this one looked like a real Spider-Man with big white eyes. Also there's a scene when a kid is bullied and Spider-Man came and made the bullies away and talked to the kid. That scene made Spidey more like Spidey.<br/><br/>The CGI and fightings are okay, but they're not epic at all. Most scenes were forgettable and really boring. I really don't like them, like when Electro playing the Itsy Bitsy Spider song. Hans Zimmer was really dumb putting dubstep on this and electro went like ""Today's my birthday, time to light up my candles!"". The plot was really not cool, especially when Harry Osborn went like ""I want your blood, Spider-Man"". This is not a disappointing movie but it's kinda worse. Like I said, it's not even as good as Spider-Man 3. When the Green Goblin was knocked out and when we saw him in prison, how could he change back to himself? And I felt like when Gwen Stacy wanted to help Peter Parker defeating Electro, at least she should've said ""Spider-Man need help too!"" like MJ in Spider-Man 2 or 3 (I don't's remember).<br/><br/>I really don't like this movie. It's really terrible, except for a few parts. This is for sure one of the worst Spider-Man movies I've ever seen. This movie had proved that the CGI and fights are better, but it had also proved that sequels could sometimes be a big mess.<br/><br/>Ratings: 5.4/10"

","Even though The Amazing Spider-Man was not as successful as the Sam Raimi films it did well enough critically and commercially to raise hopes for an effective sequel. I personally found the first film boring because the more serious take on Spider-Man simply doesn't work because of the type of character he is. With that said Garfield and Stone have enough chemistry to carry any film, which I'm pleased to say continues here. The film certainly has its good points and importantly takes itself less seriously than the previous film, but it is still awkward from a tonal viewpoint and suffers from a recurring comic book problem of forcing too many characters into the film.<br/><br/>Story: Spider-Man deals with numerous obstacles in his life including his fragmented relationship with his girlfriend Gwen, his rediscovered friendship with a gravely ill Harry Osborn and the emergence of an electricity powered villain. All the while he comes closer to finding out what really happened to his parents. As you can tell that's quite a lot to fit in and it's the inability to give all the arcs proper time that is one of the films main issues. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is excellently developed as well as the most enjoyable aspect yet again, but Electro is built-up only to be completely absent for the middle section and Harry's personality changes entirely in the blink of an eye. Also I don't think the sub-plot of Peter's parents is interesting and it serves little importance to the film overall.<br/><br/>Hero: Andrew Garfield does a good job once again as our title hero. I think he has just the right balance of confidence and sincerity as well as looking perfect for the role. He might lack some of the quirks and geekiness of the character, but I don't think that he's trying to play Peter in that style and the character is much more at ease with who he is here than previously which works for the film. <br/><br/>Villains: Jamie Foxx is underwhelming as Electro. To be fair to him the character is simply The Riddler from Batman Forever, a nerd who goes from worshipping Spider-Man to wanting him dead. He has very little motivation, the glowing blue design is distracting and he only ends up playing a small part in the film as a whole. Dane DeHaan does an impressive job as Harry. Harry's personality and motivations are extremely inconsistent (such as the way he wants Peter's blood to live), but DeHaan is a magnetic screen presence and his delivery of the dialogue is always believable.<br/><br/>Support: Emma Stone is wonderful as Gwen, breathing so much charm and honesty into the role. The film does deal with Gwen's aspirations and smartly the character continues to develop throughout. Once again Stone's expressions are great and she is such a warm presence that you can't help but grow attached to the character. Sally Field is also good as a more relaxed Aunt May. However the less said about Paul Giamatti's stupidly over-the-top cameo as 'Rhino' the better.<br/><br/>Action: The action is a little weak here. The main fight scenes with Electro look really good and are well edited, but they don't last long enough to leave an impact and the slow motion is used too much. The climax suffers from exactly the same problem. Though it is exciting to see Spider-Man pursuing criminals with the police, there is just something about the CGI used as he swings around the city that makes him lack a sense of gravity or heft.<br/><br/>Music: The score by Hans Zimmer and numerous guest musicians is certainly different to most. It features a lot of electronic and dance elements that work well with the action sequences, whilst there are some really eerie parts during the creepier scenes that add a lot of atmosphere. It definitely has a uniqueness that makes it standout.<br/><br/>Production: From a visual viewpoint the film is more colourful and interesting to look at than its predecessor. The film has a more modern look to it, with many of the buildings and technology looking especially striking. I'm also really impressed with how New York is shot as it always looks beautiful. The character designs are mixed with the new Spider-Man costume looking great, but the Electro redesign looking rather generic. Tone-wise the film is messy. For the most part it retains a more adventurous light-hearted feel with pieces of drama (like the Raimi films), but at times it does go a little too goofy, see Rhino, and at others such as Harry's transformation it gets downright creepy. I think the ending reflects that best as the scenes following Gwen's death are genuinely emotional but the film ends with Peter back to his witty old self, it's just so jarring. The romance is the best part however, the chemistry between our leads is perfect and a lot of great situation humour comes from the relationship.<br/><br/>Conclusion: So while I do think The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a flawed film, I do find it more enjoyable than the previous entry and almost on par with the Raimi films. Its real success comes from Garfield and Stone, who are both excellent in their roles and really make you care about their characters. The romance is what holds the film together, while I think the visuals and music are both very effective. In contrast I do find the action tedious and the tonal shifts distracting. The villains are a weak point (though the actors are fine) as neither is fleshed out enough, I seriously think that if Harry was the sole enemy and fleshed out properly then we could have had a great film. For me this is a good film from a purely entertaining stance and it's easy to be wrapped up in the plight of our two main characters despite its problems."
"bryank-04844","7","1","4","17 August 2015"," . I hope you enjoy 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' as much as I did.
","I was half nervous and half excited for this sequel to one of my favorite superheroes to be released onto the world. I am a huge fan of the first film that came out a couple of years ago and thought that it was a solid reboot, even better than the original one from Sam Raimi. And I felt that it needed a reboot since the third Spidey film was one of the worst movies ever made. Needless to say, director Marc Webb and actor Andrew Garfield did a phenomenal job with their version of the web- slinger. The story was spot on, the script was solid, and the acting by everyone involved was terrific.<br/><br/>Garfield brought multiple layers and likability to the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character that Tobey Maguire never did. And while I will always love Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, possibly because they have Bruce Campbell in them, I will always resort to these new ones, because they're just that much more fun and better made. But what got me nervous about this sequel is that when the trailers started airing, we saw bit by bit that there was going to be not one, not two, but three villains in this film. It seems like a lot of story line and character development to fit in the span of a couple of hours. Several directors have tried this before and have failed miserably. Luckily for all of us, Webb has done an outstanding job, concocting the story lines to produce a forward moving and fluid pace and story arc. The results are highly entertaining and and almost perfectly done.<br/><br/>This sequel starts off with a flashback that shows us what actually happened to Peter Parker's parents and why they left him with his aunt and uncle, which is very similar to the opening of 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Then we are off swinging through the city with Spider-Man as he is trying to stop a mad man (Paul Giamatti) who is in a large truck full of some chemical, plowing through cars and people, evading the cops. Webb uses his camera so gracefully and perfectly that I could literally spend hours on end swinging with Spidey through the city. It's definitely a rush.<br/><br/>It's graduation day as well and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is number one in her class as Parker is trying to get to his own graduation to see her speech and walk across the stage an accept his diploma. Gwen and Peter still have a great relationship, but Peter still struggles with seeing visions of Gwen's dad (Denis Leary) throughout the day who reminds him to stay away from Gwen for her safety. This was really a low point of the movie and felt very cheesy, but was trying to foreshadow for later circumstances. After a chance encounter with Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a nerdy employee at Oscorp who just wants a friend and to be noticed and Spider-Man, Dillon becomes a huge obsessive fan of the web-slinger. But when a freak accident transforms him into an electrical charged mutant who seems to resemble and have the same powers as Dr. Manhattan from 'The Watchmen', his temper gets the best of him and he wants to destroy the city and Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we see Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan, excellent) set by his father's (Chris Cooper) deathbed where Norman tells his son to carry on his legacy. Here is where we see Peter and Harry's friendship that has been strained over the years, but the two pick up right where they left off and seem to have a great time together, despite everything that has happened. Webb decided to make the whole Green Goblin aspect an organic virus that attacks the body and changes your skin and eyes rather than a suite. There is a whole lot of X-Men type stuff going on here in Spider-Man with people turning into mutants and what not.<br/><br/>This Green Goblin virus kills you, but Norman tells Harry before he dies that there might be a certain type of spider venom to prolong his life or actually cure him, since this virus is hereditary. So Harry asks Parker is he can get in touch with Spider-Man for a chance at getting some of his blood for survival. It doesn't pan out so well for Harry so now it is Spider-Man vs. Electro and Green Goblin. The fight scenes are epic and a lot of fun to watch. Webb had Spider-Man use his web slinging abilities and surroundings to the fullest. I just can't wait to get back and watch these action scenes again.<br/><br/>There are some flaws though with the film. Electro didn't seem to get the amount of time he deserved and should have been given a full movie to run with his character, instead of having to share with Green Goblin. And yes, Rhino is in the film, but not for more than a minute or two. I expect he will back in future sequels. But, Webb has big plans for the Goblin in future films as this one sets up perfectly as we get to see several other future villains for a split second. Other than that, the film was a solid sequel, and far better than what I though it was going to be. The Spider-Man one liners were excellent and funny and each relationship hit its mark. And of course, Stan Lee's cameo was brilliant as always. I hope you enjoy 'The Amazing Spider- Man 2' as much as I did."
"asurber1234","10","1","4","20 December 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2; The movie I loved and hated
","I've never been known to write reviews of movies before in my life, ever, but this one was different for some reason unknown unto me. It might just be the way that this movie blends so perfectly in opposition to other movies, and the one overlying theme is portrayed so well throughout the movie all the way to the bitter, yet necessary, end (Gwen's death). The overlying theme in this movie, as best as I can determine, is time and is first exemplified as Rick Parker is rushing his way out of the Oscorp building with his research in it's entirety. Rick has been accused of foiling Oscorp's research when really he was simply trying to protect it from the wrong hands. Nonetheless this provides a means for someone to go after Rick and his wife, and while on a private jet attempting to escape they are attacked by someone seeking that which he possesses. In his last moments he uploads the data that he and his wife were trying to keep safe moments before the plane crashed. The next example the theme is Gwen's Vale Victorian speech at the beginning of the movie where she lists how people, teens in specific, think of themselves as having unlimited time with which to do whatever they see fit. She then goes on to say (ironically) that time is limited and that people should use it to make an example they would approve of unto others. Even Max Dillon (the antagonist) is an example of time. In his duties at Oscorp he is undervalued as a person who contributes anything, this enrages Max but that is beside the point, and his time is so undervalued that even on his birthday (a TIME of celebration) he is told that he could not participate with his colleagues in an event of importance, rather he is told to go repair an electrical system. Other examples of time throughout the rising plot of the movie include Harry and Norman's limited time as they are infected with a Green Goblin disease of sorts. At first it's Norman's very brief time left which then shifts to Harry's very brief time later on in the movie. Harry, unlike Norman, sought healing through Peter Parker's relationship to Spiderman who is known to have self healing abilities (unlimited time). Further along towards the end of them movie time is made an example of so much that it made my brain ache. Once the Green Goblin captured Gwen and dropped her Spiderman caught her and broke her fall into a, who'd have guessed, clock tower. The Green Goblin wasn't finished there though and he also goes into the clock tower and begins to fight Spiderman whilst Gwen attempts to find safe haven. Further along Spiderman knocks The Goblin off his glider which breaks the supports below Gwen. Spiderman launches a quick web to catch Gwen, but doesn't go unnoticed by The Goblin who then proceeds to lock Spidey's hand in place holding the web with Gwen attached on a chopping path between the cogs of the clock tower. Spidey wraps a web around The Goblin's head and then puts a choke hold on him using the clock tower's cogs, the same ones keeping Gwen safe. Next the obstruction holding ""time"" at bay is unhinged pressing the already overloaded spider to place his foot in it's place. This is what the whole movie has built up to, and an audience can feel that too, ""time"" is ""stopped"" in spidey's efforts to preserve the moment of safety in the storm. If he just has one more minute, he'll get it right? Right? Wrong...in a swift motion the tower breaks one of the cogs free allowing ""time"" to flow again. The Goblin gets slammed against the tower's wall, spidey gets free, and Gwen proceeds to fall. This is it, the moment of truth, spidey dives after Gwen and shoots a web in a last resort effort to break her fall, the web hits her abdomen, spidey grabs a suspended pole, Gwen stops instantaneously. The anxious spidey jumps down to check on his girlfriend...but what's this? She's...dead...spidey is in disbelief, I was in disbelief, you were in disbelief, and the remorseful spidey wishes he'd been a second quicker, or stuck both her hands to the taxi. Sadness ensues in both the spider and his audience and the rest of the movie is uneventful in terms of the theme, all except one bit. In the end Aunt May states ""I'm going to take one last look at it then put it where it belongs, (behind me)"" , and while she didn't say this to Peter she implied it and Peter read it. She was referring to Ben as can be told by her stashing his belongings away, but had a sense that Peter was also having trouble letting go, and gave him advice. This advice hurled him back into his suit from his 5 month depression and he began his vigilante work once again. <br/><br/>TL;DR: It's a great movie...the theme is always there in one sense or another and the theme radiates a positive message but also supports a great plot. <br/><br/>I would watch this movie again and again for the way it is presented, but I would hate the ending again and again for what happened. Is this really a bad thing though? Wouldn't it mean that movie was better for making me hate what happened at the end so much? I don't know, what I do know is I suck at writing reviews though and probably won't do this for any other movies, like honestly I just switched from review to telling the plot as it is. Awful review by me, but seriously this movie was great. Top of the line, would watch again because it makes me bawl at the end more so than The Great Gatsby would. The feels are just inexpressible."
"bowmanblue","7","1","4","3 October 2014"," General popcorn viewing
","Maybe I'm old, but I didn't enjoy Spiderman 2 as much as I wanted to. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate it, nor did I regret watching it. I just felt that there was an element of 'seen it all before' in there.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the plot of a Spiderman film. If you can't guess that our web-slinging superhero star comes up against another baddie then you really need to watch more movies! I wasn't expecting some deep and revolutionary film, filled with perfect character arcs and plot twists, but I did think it would be a little more original than it was.<br/><br/>It seemed to want to cater for the 'tween' generation, pushing Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey's relationship to the forefront of the film, as if it was nothing more than a 'teen drama.' Yes, there's the 'fantasy' element to the story of how being a superhero interferes with your 'normal' teenage romance, but when Peter and Gwen are doing their 'make-up/break-up' routine, it comes across as a 'Twilight' movie with more cobwebs.<br/><br/>The fact is that a Spiderman movie is at its best when we see Spiderman. Andrew Garfield is much better (and much more interesting) as the superhero than when he's wandering up and down the halls of his school moaning about Gwen. The film-makers really should have learnt from 'Iron Man 3' about how the public feels about superhero movies where the hero doesn't spend enough time 'in costume.' However, when the action starts it gets going. You may have seen the advertising promoting 'three' villains. Well, that is technically true, but the only one you'll really get to know properly is Jamie Fox's 'Electro.' He's the main threat to Spiderman (and the best). And when he starts kicking off then our web-slinging friend is in trouble. Everything is better when things explode. Jamie Fox plays the tragic villain with sympathy at first, before slipping into full-blown menace. The 'Green Goblin' is also in it, but he's secondary at this stage to Electro. And don't even bother mentioning 'Rhino' – he's barely got more than a cameo in the film.<br/><br/>It's a long film, stretching over two hours and, although the action is exciting and when it's good it's good, there was still what felt like a lot of 'filler' in there that could have been trimmed out to make it a little less irrelevant.<br/><br/>Probably loved by kids and enjoyed by me on only some of the levels it was meant for."
"kaanozcakmak","7","1","4","27 September 2014"," This film is totally bullshit
","some creatures are too overpowered when you compare to others. Peter could save Gwen but he was too flighty. He could not calculate so she died unfortunately. Green Goblin showed up only at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I was expecting more to be honest. Electro was powerful but he was fool at the same time. I think it would be better if Morgan Freeman played spider- man. He could have saved Gwen. By the way, Gwen looks foolish when she smiles. Because of that reasons my point is 9. I hope next film will be better than this crap. SPider maaaan SPiderrr mananan ring tone was funny though. He needs to buy an iphone. His phone looks very old."
"nickknight007","9","1","4","9 September 2014"," thank god
","I actually believe this film and the first is much better than first trilogy. First one set it up well. Garfield is immense as Spiderman adding in the sarcastic teenage attitude from the comic books.<br/><br/>The bad guys were also well introduce and spread out unlike like Spiderman 3 when all involved at once. Electro adaptation worked very well and Foxx did good job as he just wanted to be needed like Spiderman is and when people choose Spiderman he flips.<br/><br/>Green Goblin was a good choice and perfectly introduced and the end death straight out of the comics books is one I did not expect in the film as a I thought would happen in third film. The rhino also made me chuckle as a minor villain which happens to set up sinister six plot and brings Spiderman back out over him losing someone.<br/><br/>I do not understand people slating this movie as there is plenty to like. people probably don't like it as they cant understand it or never read any comics or graphic novels in their lives.<br/><br/>Bring on number 3"
"Adamtylersmith09","9","1","4","31 August 2014"," I don't know why many people didn't like this.
","This movie franchise made me feel more close to reading the comics than the previous movies. While Tobey McGuire's Peter Parker was more similar to the comics, his Spider-Man was lacking the humour and charm that Garfield's really nailed, especially in this sequel.<br/><br/>The story to this was gripping, while some parts were a little more unclear than others, I found that for the most of it, I was on the edge of my seat tensed up. As the film plays out and you see how hard it is to be Peter and Spider-Man without making huge sacrifices make him more sympathetic and it also makes him more susceptible to mistakes, which is shown more and more as it goes on that balancing his life and his ""side job"". <br/><br/>The way that they made the major villains so much more vibrant and made them stand out better than their original creations visually, while sticking somewhat to the root of their evil upbringings.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx was a great Max Dillon and an even more engaging Electro. The way he looked was unbelievable, making his glowing skin with the current of electricity circulating through his body is so beautiful and is extraordinary to look at, without being too distracting from his character.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's new suit, is also very reminiscent of more recent comic books, particularly the Ultimate costume. The raised webbing on his suit, his web shooters blending in more and looking more sleek and best of all, the way his eyes look. By far my favourite look for the web head.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're a comic fan and love creative deviations, without straying a long ways away, then give this a shot. There isn't a lot to lose, and you may even be surprised how this holds up to the previous trilogy. Personally, I'd love to see Webb and Garfield continue the series and continue to top themselves."

"Magnuzone","Null","1","4","31 August 2014"," Annoying and not very exciting
","Time for Spider Man again, this time a long and boring lovedrama.<br/><br/>What strikes you from the very beginning is the long and unengaging dialogues. And the relationship drama that seems to have been taken directly from an MTV ducusoap. Peter Parker and Gwen is together, they break up, they are together again. In the end it's like you want to scream out ""I really don't care, give me some action please"". And aunt May isn't the usual nice and easy to like character we are used to see in the comics. Here she is annoying and irritating and take up way too much space. <br/><br/>Best actor in this movie is clearly Dane DeHaan who can look really devilish sometimes, but there isn't much for him to work with.<br/><br/>I don't know if Marc Webb deliberately tried to make it into a teen love drama or if it's just badly written, but in comparison to the super hero sagas we have been fed lately on the screen, this is sub par in every way. Way too long between the action sequences and taking the story's very thin red thread in consideration the length of the movie could easily be cut in half.<br/><br/>The special effects is good and well made, but the action sequences are much to local. They take place in specific areas, between 1 villain and 1 Spider and never really reaches the heights you have seen in other Spider Man movies. And then of course it's the constant bullet time effects whenever Spider Man does anything, which is nice the first 10 times but gets a bit dull after a while.<br/><br/>So all in all..a dull and not very fun move super hero movie."
"Vivekmaru45","5","1","4","18 August 2014"," The Sequel Should Have Been Better Than Original. A Testament To Poor Screen writing And General Lack Of Good Ideas.
","After thoroughly enjoying the first part of The Amazing Spider-man, I was expecting a move involving and better film plot-wise, with a villainous character who is able to assert himself. This film is normally aimed at the teen generation and not the adult, old and loyal fans of Spider-man who have been seeing him on television since the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's.<br/><br/>Ted Raimi was the guy that I feel damaged the franchise by casting Tobey Maguire who I feel was not mature enough to play the part of Spider-man. The later two sequels to Raimi's film confirmed this. The character of the 60's and 80's animated Spider-man was the best because Peter Parker was a scientist at heart and he used his brains - not agility to get out of sticky situations. If you own the original 1967 animated Spider-man DVD, than you should be very happy, as this were the best Spider-man episodes ever made. And in addition to this you could add the 80's and 1994 animated Spider-man series to complete your collection.<br/><br/>In this film a new super-villain is introduced known as Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) who has never been seen in a live action movie but has only appeared in the animated version. The Green Goblin also makes his appearance, but he is so similar to Hobgoblin played by Willem Dafoe in the Ted Raimi directed film. <br/><br/>Plot: Peter Parker is haunted by visions of Gwen's deceased father, police captain George Stacy. This does not bode well, as similar visions by a well known soothsayer predicted the death of a well known Roman emperor. Call it a sort of premonition. Peter ends his relationship with Gwen as a result of a vow made to her father.<br/><br/>However he can't hide the fact that he loves her deeply and that she is a part of his life, and so he returns to her.<br/><br/>In all this confusion, OsCorp Industries employee Max Dillon has a horrendous accident with some genetically altered electric eels(in the same way like the Spectacular Spider-man Episode). He becomes Electro. <br/><br/>Add to this the passing of Norman Osborn who before dying tells his son Harry that he has a rare hereditary transmitted disease. Harry takes the formula which was funded by his father, but created by Peter's father who was a genius in the field of bio-genetics with disastrous results to his personality. <br/><br/>Watch the film to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>I found the script pathetic, but the special effects were good. Andrew Garfield's acting and attitude in the film is like that of teenager. His acting in the previous installment was better and he should have improved upon that. I'm not a fan of Emma Stone and I have seen much prettier actresses in my life: Kari Wuhrer, Valentina Vargas, Angelina Jolie and Julia Roberts. How they can cast her when there are a lot of beautiful women in the U.S.A., is a mystery. Jamie Foxx is suffering from apparent hair-loss as seen in the film. He should either shave his head or resort to hair transplants if he wants to keep looking as good as he was in earlier days. His plus point is his acting, and he is definitely getting better and better with age. Dane DeHaan gives a solid performance as both Harry Osborn and The Green Goblin. <br/><br/>Verdict: Not one I'll want to see again, as I've a lot of better films in my DVD collection. So I'll give it a score of 5/10.<br/><br/>You can now build your own home cinema for a lot less than in previous years as LED TV's are cheaper. By a HD GRAPHICS CARD: Radeon HD5450 with Hyper-memory and a 32"" Sony Bravia Smart W674A Led TV and creative A100 SBS 2.1 speakers and you're set to go. You can hook this up to your desktop or laptop if it has an HDMI port and play HD movies directly from your PC.<br/><br/>I have the above setup and I enjoy my films immensely."

If I would like to see some romance and crying, I would pick another title. I am not sure if it's the personal choice of Mr.Garfield to portray a comic hero like this, but the exaggerated romantic sense and posing as a so-called charismatic lover is nothing to do with the Spider-Man. Physically, he is a good choice for the character and totally matching the original drawings by Steve Ditko. I wish I could say the same thing for the script and/or the artistic ability of the leads.<br/><br/>The only thing hooked me up with this movie is the good portrayal of Green Goblin, by Dane DeHaan. I can also say cgi scenes were almost flawless and very lively, but I am afraid that's about it.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Although it was completely unnecessary, I enjoyed ""The Amazing Spider- Man"" and thought it to be a good, if not great, addition to the franchise. However, I don't feel the same way regarding the latest installment, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"".<br/><br/>After a prologue that showcases the ultimate fate of Peter's parents, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" picks up shortly after where the first one let off. Our hero, Peter Parker has hooked up with Gwen Stacy yet again, despite the promise that Peter made at the end of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". This promise, however, is a source of inner turmoil for Peter as he struggles between being Spider-Man and loving Gwen. Gwen soon breaks up with him and Peter is left alone.<br/><br/>It is this relationship between Peter and Gwen that prevents the film from being an outright disaster. Their relationship is one of the film's sole bright spots, and is way better than the relationship between MJ and Peter in the original trilogy. They share strong chemistry, which is in no doubt due to the fact that they are a couple off the set as well. Emma Stone gives a strong performance as Gwen and Andrew Garfield is also a good Peter/Spider-Man (although it is debatable whether or not he is better than Tobey Maguire.)<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Sally Field is a good, but underutilized, Aunt May. The truth of the matter, however, is that there are simply too many villains. The film has ""Spider-Man 3 syndrome"" and as a result, it suffers. Even though Jamie Foxx's Electro is the main villain, his motivations for wanting to plunge the Big Apple into eternal darkness are simply non-existent. His transformation from office nerd to super-villain is hardly believable. Meanwhile, Dane DeHann's Harry Osborn is initially a strong character but is then given some of the film's most laughable scenes in which he overacts. And just like Electro, his transformation to super-villain occurs way too fast. Paul Giamatti's Russian gangster is laughable and I could barely understand anything that he said during his brief appearances in the film. The only reason he is shoehorned in is to setup the upcoming Sinister Six film.<br/><br/>The villains aren't the films only weak point. The plot is a bit disjointed and unevenly paced, as it sags in the middle. The soundtrack, despite being composed by Hans Zimmer (who composed the soundtrack for ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception""), is uneven as well, with some of the music working well and the rest being some of his most unremarkable work. Meanwhile, the action scenes are fairly entertaining with a sequence in Times Square being the standout.<br/><br/>However, the film concludes in what is arguably one of the most heartbreaking scenes in a Spider-Man film. As our hero tries to save the girl he loves he inadvertently snaps her neck with he suddenly breaks her fall. The resulting scenes of mourning showcase true emotion as our hero is heartbroken and in anguish. Although Gwen's death is one of the best scenes in the movie, it is also one of the worst. Her relationship with Peter, as stated before, was one of the film's sole highlights, and now, subsequent films will suffer for it. What might have seemed as a great idea during the production of this film might not seem like such a great one if Peter and any subsequent love interest lack chemistry.<br/><br/>Despite an uneven plot and soundtrack, as well as an assortment of underdeveloped villains, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is somewhat saved by the relationship between our eponymous hero and Gwen Stacy, as well as the emotional scenes they share, and by some thrilling action sequences (even if I feel that the special effects weren't all there for this $200 million film.)<br/><br/>All in all, this film could have been worse. It could have been ""Spider-Man 3"".<br/><br/>6/10"

","I never thought my first movie review would be for a Spider-man movie but anyway here goes; I thought the movie was good especially the graphics with Spidey flying around. Maybe its just me but the manner in which the movie ended, I sort of anticipated that in the first 15 minutes. I think the choice of actor for Spider-man is great and Andrew Garfield does justice to a younger version of Spider-man. But i felt that the main bad guy for the movie was Electro but as the movie went on, I was disappointed because I wanted Jamie Fox to have a bigger involvement in the movie than it actually was. Overall I think it was a good edition to the Spider-man series and I would look forward to more sequels with more mainstream spidey villains."

","The Amazing Spider-man 2 is an 'amazing' film that takes place in an 'amazing' place where people stand a few yards from chaos to watch spider-man fight his enemies as if they were watching a Broadway show. A movie in which the villains wait until spider-man gives a speech to rouse the crowd and then proceed to spray bullets like skittles or shoot out electric bolts: none of which cause any fatalities to onlookers or people sensible enough to flee the scene. To really enjoy this movie, one has to let your inner child emerge and not to expect a superhero movie that will test your intellect. All credit most go to the director however for bringing back the lighthearted spirit of earlier superhero movies, before Christopher Nolan found success in making a darker superhero movie and every director copied his style since."

","Personally, I'm a big fan of the Marvel film series and comics, especially the Spider-Man movies, and despite being left a tad underwhelmed by the last Spider-Man reboot and especially underwhelmed by #3, I was eager to see this entry, hoping for a better outing this time.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it's far from the train wreck it could have been. Jamie Foxx delivers what is arguably the best performance in the movie as Spider- Man's adversary Electro. It is hard not to sympathize with him as he is initially a mere worker at Oscorp who admires Spider-Man, but one day endures a horrific accident and comes to despise him as a result of some major misunderstandings. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are too many subplots in one movie to focus on, and there are too many adversaries, an issue that immensely plagued the third outing if you remember. Thankfully, this alternative origin story is an interesting one, which is what prevents this sequel from feeling as overblown like the third outing was.<br/><br/>Additionally, Andrew Garfield once again makes for an unconvincing Spider-Man: Tobey Maguire wasn't a perfect fit either, but he displayed a much stronger and emotion-filled performance than this. An actor of great ability like Paul Giamatti gets very little screen time in a rather disappointingly small role.<br/><br/>Overall, the special effects are as great as ever and the movie never ceases to entertain. Far from being the best in the series, or in the Marvel saga, but doesn't unseat the third movie from its throne as the worst film in the series, either. Just keep your expectations low."
"JohnGardicotis","7","1","4","21 June 2014"," A pretty good film but a let down from the first
","When I saw ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" in theaters I had high hopes that it was going to be as good as the first. It wasn't.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. I liked Electro's storyline and the fight scenes between him and Spiderman were awesome. I liked the opening chase scene and the chemistry between Peter and Gwen. I also liked Peter and Aunt May's scenes. Now let's move onto the negatives of the film. And If you don't want to read any spoilers leave in 3,2,1.<br/><br/>Now what I didn't like about the movie. I didn't like Harry Osborn becoming the Green Goblin. Norman Osborn should have been the Green Goblin in this one instead. Another thing that bothered me was the way in which they killed Gwen Stacey off. I would of liked for them to have been more faithful to the comics. <br/><br/>I also didn't like Richard Parker's storyline as it was hyped for much of the film but there was no end reward. And I didn't like how they forgot about Uncle Ben's killer. Not cool writers. Not cool.<br/><br/>Adding to this I would have liked to seen another movie with Gwen Stacey meeting Mary Jane. They were friends in the comics and it's a shame that they couldn't develop that into ""The Amazing Spiderman 3"". Maybe they can do that in the next Spiderman reboot.<br/><br/>In conclusion it was a pretty good movie but it didn't live up to the last one for me. I know people will say otherwise but I just wanted to share my on honest and open opinion of this movie."
"scottjohnson7896","7","1","4","14 June 2014"," A Solid Sequel (Raging FIlm Reviews)
","In case you missed all the promotional stuff running for The Amazing Spider-Man 2, it is now out; and just like the first one, it is dividing critics everywhere. While it does continue to be a great role for Andrew Garfield, the movie feels too stuffed with unnecessary plot lines, but that does not necessarily mean it is bad.<br/><br/>We pick up on graduation day and Spider-Man is off saving the day while Gwen Stacy is delivering her speech that connects all too with her relationship with Peter Parker. Peter still feels guilty about the death of Gwen's father in the previous film, and his promise to stay away from her in order to protect her is weighing down on him. This leads to a subsequent breakup, which results in Peter throwing himself into his role as savior of the city.<br/><br/>Around this time we meet Max, played by Jamie Foxx, who only wants to be noticed. After being saved by Spider-Man, he becomes completely obsessed, even imagining that they are best friends. One day at work, on his birthday no less, he is suffers from an accident and is transformed into Electro, the first of our villains.<br/><br/>The death of Norman Osborn brings Harry back into the mix. Peter's best friend from his childhood has been gone for nearly a decade and now he gets put in charge of Oscorp while also succumbing to a genetic disease he inherited from his father. Of course, anybody who has read the comics knows he will soon become the Green Goblin, our other main villain.<br/><br/>Finally we have Peter wanting to discover what exactly happened to his parents, whom he's felt abandoned by his entire life.<br/><br/>These are the major plot points in the movie, but each of them has several minor threads that we follow throughout the film, so it is easy to see that things get a bit muddled. All that would be necessary to make this film better would be to just trim the fat. We don't need a Spider-Man movie to be nearly 2.5 hours. The reason for this is the fact that there are already two sequels announced for Spiderman. On top of that there is the Sinister Six film which was recently announced. which features 6 of Spidey's main villains in one movie. If you thought that Spiderman 3 had too many villains, well, be prepared for this one.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield again pulls off, in my opinion, a better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire. He is snarky and witty while Spider-Man, but as Peter Parker he is awkward and relatable. We see the effects of his role weighing down on him. Without Gwen as his girl, he has nothing else to do other than to continue to save the city. His relationship with his Aunt too is strained. He knows she is hiding information about his parents, but she won't tell him. Emma Stone is also great again as Gwen Stacy. Her chemistry with Garfield is completely visible and welcoming. We feel the passion they share, and it makes it so much harder when they break up.<br/><br/>Now for the villains: after initially setting up Electro as our main villain, we do not see him for most of the film. His initial attack in Times Square is a great scene with some exceptional special effects, but after this scene we do not really see him until the climatic battle. All of the previews set him up as this great villain, but we never get any real motives for his action, and he becomes another victim of the ""multiple villain syndrome"" that was ever prevalent in Spider-Man 3. Foxx does a great job at making Electro come alive, but due to the writing, his performance is pretty limited.<br/><br/>Dane DeHaan, on the other hand, inhabits The Green Goblin even better than James Franco did in Spider-Man 3. However, his transformation is so late in the film that it seems sort of after-the-fact. By the time he transforms he only has one real scene as the Goblin before the end of the film. While we do know he will hold a bigger role in the following films, it seems almost wasted, just like Foxx.<br/><br/>The trailers also tease Rhino, played by Paul Giamatti in an over-the-top Russian accent, in this film. However this is not the case. I won't spoil anything, but don't expect him to be a major focus of the film.<br/><br/>Aside from the writing issues, there is one really just terrible scene that has Peter Parker making a diagram of all of the connections between his parents and Oscorp, all with the Gone, Gone, Gone by Phillip Phillips playing in the background. It completely took away from the tone of the movie and just seemed like a contrived way to spotlight a hit-song. It felt very similar to the scene in the first one where Peter is learning to use his powers with a Coldplay song in the background.<br/><br/>But the most important thing about the film is that it is fun. Spider-Man films are always fun. The exhilarating web-swinging, the witty humor, and the ever-creative use of the webs as a tool to subdue enemies are all here. So you have to go in and not expect this film to have Oscar-worthy writing, but rather enjoy the ride. This film strays into some dark territories, if the comic books are any indicator, yet it is handled excellently by Marc Webb.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a flawed, but wholly entertaining film that continues the saga of the new generation of the lovable superhero. Now we just have to wait 2 years for the third one.<br/><br/>for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com"

","Peter Parker is back as he is on top of the world with his love and finally graduating from High School. Unfortunately this crime fighter cannot stay away from saving lives and continues his double life as Spiderman. This movie has a slow build up as it develops the complex relationship with is love Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and builds up the development of Electro (Jamie Foxx). Peter Parkers long lost friend appears and becomes a rival in the Green Goblin and layers of other drawn out story lines are painted. If you are a spider man fan, it might be right for you.

"kyle-domination","7","1","4","27 May 2014"," Surprisingly bombastic but entertaining, Spider-Man excels in characterisations and spectacle but suffers from a muddled script.
","The Amazing Spider-Man was a hard buy. It's aesthetics didn't match Sam Raimi's trilogy, despite how bombastic the third one was, but Andrew Garfield was a better Spider-Man, not a better Peter Parker. It was a favourable average film that had a lot of room for improvement but since they announced the second film, I was instantly excited. I was expecting the sequel to have major improvements over the first and my expectations were correct. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has lots of improvements to admire. Director Marc Webb's sequel is bold and bright and possesses charm in abundance. It swings into the future and carries the audience with it. Entertainment is important and this film has it. One thing in the film is noticeable, however, it suffers from a clumsy script.<br/><br/>Events begin not long after the end of the first film. Peter Parker is still haunted by the death of Gwen's father and the promise he failed to keep (to protect his daughter by leaving her alone). But in some ways he's moved on, graduating high school, enjoying life and really embracing the role of being New York's protector. Unlike so many superheroes, the identity of Spider-Man doesn't seem to be a burden but a release for Peter – he's confident and cocky with his now-honed abilities. Director Marc Webb presents this brilliantly. The audience are instantly hooked into Peter's life and his responsibilities and this is because of engaging screenplay and playful cinematography, expertly executed. The beginning of the film shows Spider-Man battling on-the-run criminals as part of his responsibility and this gets in the way of Peter and Gwen's relationship. During this chase, Peter saves a man from a car crash named Max Dillon (played by Jamie Foxx) who works for Oscorp, led by Harry Osborn, Peter's childhood friend. The film tries to introduce Max Dillon as a character for whom we should feel sympathy – he's socially awkward, lonely, unappreciated, and since Spider-Man saved his life, he's become obsessed with the hero. Max, shortly after a major accident at Oscorp, discovers that he has powerful electric powers and soon becomes Electro, the main antagonist of the film. This is well told through the detailed, enjoyable but increasingly clumsy script. One thing that confuses me about the film is that the first instalment was supposed to be ""the untold story of Peter Parker"". This film actually shares more untold elements than the first, such as finding out what happened to Peter's parents. Peter's parents are a big part of The Amazing Spider-Man 2's plot, without going into much detail. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 benefits from a lot of good qualities, such as a brilliant chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, a great Spider-Man, satisfying and exhilarating action and well presented villains but also negatively benefits from minor issues. It's childish but emotional script penned by Alex Kurtsman & Roberto Orci lets the film down and frankly, it may be a biased opinion, their work on Transformers was TERRIBLE. There's a lot going on in Amazing Spider-Man 2, and sadly it doesn't always come together because of it's writers. <br/><br/>Action, as you expect from a Marvel film, is very good indeed. Spider-Man's abilities are shown perfectly without any flaw in the picture. Music is quite unique and heroic, brought together by Hans Zimmer, The Magnificent Six, Pharrell Williams & Johnny Marr. It certainly sounds good, with high-quality instruments and themes but some material sounds like it came from another movie. The acting is very good as well. Andrew Garfield is a FANTASTIC Spider-Man and is certainly better at his role than the previous instalment. The film positively benefits from a great cast in overall and there is nothing to judge, especially Dane DeHann as he steals the show as Harry Osborn / Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Pros & Cons:<br/><br/>+ Great chemistry with Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and director Marc Webb.<br/><br/>+ Very entertaining presentation and opening. Perfectly judged slingshot ending.<br/><br/>+ Great Spider-Man action and great villains.<br/><br/>+ Improves the strengths of the first film entirely such as action and presentation.<br/><br/>+ Unique and powerful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, The Magnificent Six, Pharrell Williams and Johnny Marr.<br/><br/><ul><li>Disappointing script and muddled story dominates the film's positive reception.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not enough action from a Spider-Man film like the first.</li></ul><br/><br/>Verdict: 7.7 out of 10"

","I'm probably not be the most objective to review the second installment of the spider-man reboot, since I really don't find the actor that portraits the protagonist convincing...but I still gave it a chance. It wasn't terrible, but far, very far from good.<br/><br/>the action scenes were quit good, but there were so little of them that they didn't really help this film.<br/><br/>Most of the time (at least it felt like that to me) it was just annoying teenage drivel...I mean, I get it... Spiderman is a young adult with corresponding problems and that was another key factor how he got so popular, since it was easier to relate to him......BUT the comics never totally focused on that like this movie did.<br/><br/>Another problem this movie has is character development. The main villain started out quite promising (though a bit to over the top nerdy and helpless)but instead of focusing on him and using the potential he had for a kind of frankenstein-esque monster the producers choose to make him perform an emotional u-turn and become a one-dimensional bad guy.<br/><br/>the same thing goes for the other appearing antagonists. Harry Osbourne gets some air time but his transformation into his alter ego comes so fast and unauthentic that this movie would've been better of without him. I won't even start about rhino (though he was a dumb ass in the comics too.)<br/><br/>Another problem I had with the film was it's silly (or perhaps unnecessary) exposure of spidey's (non canonical) past and the stupid display of crowds (that for example can't get close enough to stare at a savage tank that fires randomly around itself...really....not even very stupid people are that dumb).<br/><br/>No...This movie sometimes bored me, then annoyed me and in the end left me somewhat unimpressed.<br/><br/>It is a cheesy product that devotes itself to satisfy teenage-clichés in the same manner that the twilight movies did ...but if that is your thing you should go for it."

","We've always known that Spider-Man's most important battle has been within himself: the struggle between the ordinary obligations of Peter Parker and the extraordinary responsibilities of Spider-Man. But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp."

","Once again, I left the theater with feeling as if I had been slighted. It was the same feeling after viewing The Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>The movie was long winded for all the wrong reasons. There was too much exposition regarding things that stalled out as soon as that particular scene was over. For the length of the film, things tied together so loosely there was not much I felt invested in toward the end. The film was lacking in writing, cohesion, pacing, and structure.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes that just came off as annoying. Most prominent in my recollection was the segment where Gwen was about to commence with her school interview and Peter showed up. All he did was act spastic, and speak incoherently for three solid minutes, all just to end up wishing her luck. I was done with the film by the time Electro was creating dub-step music when coming into contact with the electrical equipment during a battle.<br/><br/>There was no character I felt compelled to care for, or a character I could relate to. By the time any real gravity took place in the story I was distracted with the possibility that the film was almost over. Which, to my dismay, it was not.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the cinematography and camera work during action scenes from Spiderman's point of view. But in all, along with my Father-In-Law, we couldn't help but feel that all of the gimmicks and cliché occurrences took away from the strength of pivotal moments in the movie. I am hoping for a Director's Cut! It worked for Daredevil."

","Ciaran: I really didn't know what to think of this movie it was poorly edited, the villains were cramped in and the story started out alright but then was just rushed for the latter part of the film and i predicted everything in this film. But there was some light, the acting, the only good part of the movie, Garfield suited Spider-Man and played Parker well, Emma Stone was great but Paul Giamatti as Rhino, the wrong decision, he was only on screen for a few minutes as rhino and he really did not suit the part i was almost laughing just at how over the top he was making the rhino look, so i feel someone else would have better suited the role of Rhino. Anyway, moving along the foreshadowing seen in one scene later in the film revealed that we may see the sinister six in the next installment of the Amazing Spider-Man series- i really do hope they go along with this. Anyway on to the negative aspects of the film- the editing was horrible the film was so jumbled it was making the editing from Dead Man Down look good. There would be an action scene and then it would flick to an out of place scene not serving any story or actually anything purposeful. And now the story- the most predictable story ever, there was no surprises- NONE, i was bored when there wasn't action and even then some action scenes were just poorly written. And now finally the extremely strange scene where Spider-Man shoots a web which has a hand at the end of it, there is some symbolism here (as he just about to save someone and it is as if he is reaching out for them, and lending his hand- stupid because Spider-Man is a superhero, and i would expect this from a superhero)but this scene is just pointless, stupid and actually a bit embarrassing and it really did ruin the movie for me. To conclude the movie had limited ups and some good moments but for the most part it was a pile of predictable junk. 6/10<br/><br/>Jacob: I originally loved the first installment but the second viewing made it evident that it was just a cash grab on the Spiderman name. I was actually looking forward to this movie and it did improve some aspects but seldom performed anything special and is actually one big embarrassing turd. I will quickly look over the positive aspects: Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are both terrific actors and have one adorable little romance, the film is very bright and colourful and the action is often exciting. It eventually became clear that this movie's structure and editing was jumbled. I heard rumours and news about different subplots, characters and I felt apprehensive because this had the potential to turn into a cluster-bomb and my predictions were seemingly met. There is way too much information and stories that this movie is trying to tell. As a result character motivations are rushed, as well as their own story lines. Things are put aside to make room for more plots and predictable twists. Paul Giamatti was hamming it up as well as the incredibly goofy Jamie Foxx as Electro. Aunt May is a nurse and we cut to her during the final battle for some reason as well as some random airline pilots and of all the things they could have cut out , they left the most pointless plot lines in. Why is there an old clock tower in an electricity grid? How does Gwen know the grid? She is just a high school student. The big twists? Oscorp is bad! How about the stupid web hand? Harry Osborne makes a nice touch but is also rushed. This is a long, stupid and cramped movie just made so Sony can keep their rights. This movie is the result of corporate greed 4/10."

","I brought my son last night with anticipation of a blockbuster follow up. Sadly this movie dragged on full of story line that robbed itself of dynamic flow an action paced film requires.<br/><br/>We've seen books turn into movies. This movie felt like a movie turned into a paperback book. The scenes had too much dialog in where redundancy of its context turned this action into more of a soap opera. I found myself having to keep myself optimistic that the movie will progress.<br/><br/>Without having to give spoiler alerts, the scenes that had action were more of a show of graphics horsepower than brilliance in storyline. The villain(s) roles were poorly written in a way that was haphazard, untrue to the purists, and as if this will be the last Spider-Man installment. I say this because it seemed as they ran out of money/time or just didn't care to take attention to detail. If it weren't for my son wanting to see this movie, I wouldn't mind leaving. Thankfully Emma Stone kept me intrigued. Otherwise I would have been searching for a pillow.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man franchise has done a poor job in transitioning away from its comic book aesthetic the way the Batman franchise did into the Darkknight franchise. Bottom-line I still prefer the original Spider-Man franchise because it was the best written and produced. How can they make this up to me? Well they kind of blew it with the villain aspect. But if they find a way to finally link Spider-Man to his Avenger teammates, that would be ultimate."
"CaptainSweatpants","8","2","13","28 April 2014"," Unlike many Superhero Movies entertaining AND surprising.
","Normally I don't tend to go in Superhero Movies with high expectations in terms of Story and especially Logic. I watch these Movies because I want to see Action. Fast cut scenes, bombastic explosions, amazing special-effects and breathtaking Fightscenes - if possible in Slowmotion. This kind of attrition war fares attract the young audience - me included - and this is what they want to see ( which is also the reason why we soon will be literally flooded with Superhero Movies by Marvel and DC).<br/><br/>And in exactly this point ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise Of Electro"" convinced and surprised me equally: The entire Optic looks amazing, especially in 3D. Slowmotion, spectacular tracking shots and the fight- scenes with the villain Electro are a feast for eyes and ears, especially if you watch the Movie in Dolby Atmos! The soundtrack fits perfectly and supports the appearance of Electro fantastic - goosebumps guaranteed. However, besides of the gimmickry the Movie offers something else, which differentiates it positive from the plenty of other Superhero Movies: Humanity. <br/><br/>Then unlike other Movies of this type, is Spider-Man no Billionair nor a Mastermind; Spider-Man alias Peter Parker is a normal guy, how it could be everyone: With normal problems and in a difficult stage of life where he has to face multiple inner conflicts. This should especially address the younger target audience, in some scenes maybe even pierce to their heart. The movie manages it surprisingly well to make the cluster of human problems tangible for the viewer, always with the right balance between the emotional confused Peter Parker and the with Electro confronted Spider-Man. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is beyond perfect and creates a emotional connection with the love couple and the audience.<br/><br/>Anyhow, the Movie is absolutely entertaining and delivers Action, Drama, Romance and the typical Spider-Man slapstick humor. The viewer gets his money worth."

I can't even come close to MKB humour normally but felt I was damn close in the first 10 minutes here. Cliché characters, insipid dialogue and amateurish acting. I never thought I'd admire the fine acting abilities of Tobey but at least it was realistic in a fantasy film.

","The portrayal of the Electro villain in this movie was horrifying and weird. Gave me a very awkward and odd feeling to watch as the entire movie was just uncomfortable. Also the obvious morbid death scene that was overly dramatized looking for a shock from the audience left us all disturbed and clearly paved the way for Tom Holland to boot Garfunkel out of the franchise."
"madplayer-55528","2","1","5","15 July 2019"," Inconsistent mess
","This movie is bad. Not only does it fail to entertain a general public, but also fans of spiderman. The plot is all over the place with so many villains, so many characters and so many subplots. The actors are very ok except for the goblin. Electro is an awful villain with a cliche origin story and a boring personality, the Green Goblin is even worse and Rhino only comes twice I believe. The subplot with Spiderman's parents is stupid and boring. The movie has good actors whose performances are just underwhelming. The music is so bad, which sucks because you want a Spiderman movie to have really cool music or at least ok music. The only good parts were, like in the amazing Spiderman, the scenes between Gwen and Peter.
This movie is such a waste of time. It's probably one of the worst superhero movie I've ever seen."

"ikjones-08629","2","1","5","18 May 2019"," Some How Worse Than The First
","Somehow worse than the last film. Peters parents have not been very large in comics and haven't really blown up in the stories they've been in. It was an intriguing thought. But the way they used him was so inadequate. They said that Richard Parker specifically made it so that the powers could have only affected Peter. This is really annoying and I honestly think Stan Lee would hate this movie. When Stan Lee created Spider-Man (Miles Morales, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy) his intention was to create a character where anyone was able to get bitten and become a superhero like race, gender, sexuality, beliefs. And this film decides to crap on Stan Lee and makes it so that it was Peter's destiny to become Spider-Man. They even made a whole film based around it - Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse. Peter Parker had a soft change. Not a big thing, just a minor nitpick. Andrews voice for Parker is a New Yorker accent, and this movie it got more aggressive. But unless you watch the movies immediately back to back it is quite unnoticeable.<br/><br/>They have improved Spider-Man but now he is more Deadpool than Spider-Man. What I mean by this is that he goes with more making people laugh than saving people. So an example is at the very start of the film is when he starts to annoy Rhino but instead of stopping him he just makes jokes. Especially since you see him rampaging and killing people on the street. He has improved but they replaced the fact that he was a criminal in the last film, with Deadpool like personality. Every scene with Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield made me want to rip my eye out. They were boring and repetitive. They were both quite. Them two in the same scene acting wise has not really improved.The beginning was probably the best ever shot I have seen in a film. The cinematography in the flick was incredible. There are so many plot holes in the film. People are running upstairs which at the end of them are blocked, and they ran to get away from the bad guy. Green Goblin is ill and his father is just dying and same with his grandfather. In that logic that means to any simple-minded human being, he would die at the same age as his father. There were three antagonists in the movie and that's if you count Rhino as one. I liked Rhino and that was it, although I hate how much of him they used. He is a big part of Marvel comics. Electro and Goblin are both dumb. So Electro's origin was fine but his intentions were unclear.<br/><br/>And the thing that was so unintentionally funny was that when he was getting his power in a fish tank. His tooth gap disappeared as his teeth attracted towards each other with electricity. And there was so much earnestness that went into that 5 seconds moment. Green Goblin had a bad actor, looks when he turned into the Goblin, and his character development could have been grown more. The reason I thought the Rhino was so great was the CGI concept and the actor. People say there were too many villains. I think it's fine but to make it work, you have to develop them all together otherwise it turns into a villain origin story. The audio was as I said, the same as Amazing Spider-Man 1. The ending was actually good because I'm tired of Emma and Andrews relationship with their characters. The end fight was also great. The end credit scene left me excited despite the fact that we won't get a third. The ending also showed the Rhino in a huge suit and fired rockets at Spider-Man. And somehow he redirects the rockets towards innocent people. The bad things I said despite how many there are, are a very big deal. So that explains the rating."

","Amazing spider-man 2 went as expected, well at least almost. The Death of Gwen Stacy ( Emma Stone ) was not something most of the people or even Fans of Spider man series liked very much. the story line was the same as spider man 2's, Peter Parker and Harry Osborn with his green fancy weapon was all the same. it is expected that the 3rd movie of this new series will have the same story as of the spider man 3. what always used to make the spider man movies more fun, romantic and cool was the girl that Peter Parker (Spider man) loved and they both tried to be together in spite of the fact that spider man belongs to all the people not only one. but in this movie the most shocking thing was the death of Emma Stone, it wasn't really a wise choice. why? because spider man is more based on love and romance rather than his heroic actions and saving people. Spider man can never be put next to titles like Iron Man, Batman, Thor or Hulk because their main purpose is the super hero himself, not things like love or etc. i hope the director, crew or actors/actresses understand this and do something real good about that because i don't know about other people but i myself personally am very disappointed about the death of Emma Stone."
"sonicfireball13-875-821622","2","1","5","29 December 2014"," its worth it only if your Spiderman fan
","Here's the gist on The Amazing Spider man 2 <br/><br/>I wanted to like the sequel better then the first to prove the critics wrong but they were right on a few parts! <br/><br/>Amazing spider man 2 started out great with Spiderman flying in to help the cops catch a run away Ozcorp van driven by the Rhino who only has a cameo, but the problem with this spider man movie is there are too many hints and cameos but the special effects was better then Spiderman 3 was.<br/><br/>I think there should of been only two villains. The main villain should of been Max who becomes Electro and stuck with the plot to find out who killed peters parents in the airplane. I liked the graduation at the beginning with Gwen speech and how spider man met Max who had the blueprints but he was geeky and everyone didn't notice him. Then there was Harry who has the same disease as his father and wanted Spiderman to help him but he wouldn't. So Harry in listed Electro to get spider man but then Harry became Green goblin after getting his venom, so you see it's a mess already! I get they had to kill Gwen but they could of waited for the third movie and kept Green goblin and rhino for that movie. I did kind of like the love scenes with Gwen and Peter but Gwen was too persistent. I also liked how she helped Spiderman with Electro but she could of stayed safe. <br/><br/>They can't go anywhere in the next movie unless they start with the ending where spider man fights Rhino in his suit and Harry in jail. The main villains they can do is Venom if done right and introduce Mary Jane but that's about it as I can think of. <br/><br/>The only part I liked was when Peter was grieving over Gwen and Rhino was in his armored suit and a boy was brave enough that spider man helped in the beginning to go out in front of Rhino in his tiny spider man suit, then the real spider man flown in and said thank you to the boy but he got this! That's how it ended. The critics was right it was a mess, too much going on just like spider man 3 was! The special effects was good too but Jamie Foxx voice was raspy. I also thought the cell phone ring with the amazing spider man song was cute. I would recommend it to marvel fans who like spider man but I don't think it's worth it!"

","Just sit back and enjoy. It is not the dark, evil, sick, disgusting movie too too many seem to love. It is just pure enjoyable fun, much like Guardians of the Galaxy. Just a extremely well done movie, and Andrew Garfield's timing is fantastic, he improved so much from the 1st Amazing Spider Man it was not even measurable.<br/><br/>What a great, fun, enjoyable movie in every aspect. How anyone can come away not enjoying it says a lot about peoples ability to just enjoy fun. Why so many want dark, evil movies is beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>If you love life, enjoy laughter, root for good over evil, want more good than bad, enjoy great special effects, want to feel good and smile more, watch this movie. Better yet buy this movie and enjoy it many times for years and years!!!!!!! It appears the powers that be want a far more dark and evil Spider Man in the future. Makes a lot of sense to have a dark, evil, ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider Man"", or does it?<br/><br/>How this movie could be considered poor by so many is really a puzzle. I have not smiled while watching a movie so much since, well I can't remember. All I know is I could watch a lot more movies and TV if they were more upbeat, fun, funny, family oriented, and focused on the good in life instead of the bad. I can get the bad every day on the news, the newspapers, any Hollywood tabloid, radio, and more. I wish people craved good news and good times, more than they crave the darker news and bad news. So again, this movie is upbeat and just plain FUN!!!! Could that be why so many seem to dislike it??? Wow, what a great time to be alive."
"thegene-2","6","1","5","3 September 2014"," It's an OK movie but many may not like it all that much.
","After watching number one I could not wait to watch number 2. I was very disappointed. I gave it a 6 because I think their hearts were in the right place, but their minds were most of the time somewhere else. The movie was so slow in so many spots. Another problem is that things would happen and you would either scratch your head trying to understand more or have a real desire to know a lot more - but you never do. There were some inconsistencies or inadequacies. One of the things movies seem to do these days is have a scene that required the characters to do something quickly and they stand around and talk. You won't be disappointed if you are looking for that. The action sequences were far too fast and at times incoherent. It's like they were trying to see how much animation and special effects they could put in a few seconds. I could live with most of that as I do not expect Spider-Man to be the Great American Epic, but I want to be entertained without having to constantly think about things like ""why did they do that"" or ""that really does not make any sense"". And there are movies that can combine humor with very serious stuff very well. This is for sure not one of them. It was an 8.5 for me until the end. While the ending may have pleased a lot of people or not been much of a problem, for me it sucked the big one in 3 different ways. I won't tell you what they are but let you find out for yourself. While the rating on IMDb at present is a 7.1 for both movies, you will note that the second movie has only about half the votes as the first one. My guess is that word of mouth slowed ticket sales significantly, which reflected in a lot less reviews. At present box office for the 2 movies shows almost twice as much for the original. In fact, add both 1 and 2 box offices together and they are not much more than the total for the original Spider-Man 3. Numbers are adjusted for inflation. If you love Spider-Man because you like the character, this movie will satisfy you. However, if you expect more out of the movie, don't buy it - rent it. It is hard to make a number 2 as good as the number 1. But with just some minor adjustments, this could have been even better. Number one is a 10 in my book. If you do like I did and watch the movies back to back you will be even more disappointed I believe."

I cannot write more without telling spoilers which I did not want to, in the respect for the movie makers and those who want to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Now, there is a reason why I am giving this four stars. First, the chemistry between Peter and Gwen is good. Second, Peter has some funny lines, just as in the comic books. Third, at least it shows some villain characters, i.e., Goblin and Rhino.

"areebkhan619","7","1","5","10 August 2014"," Cons > Pros
","Marc Webb tried his full to provide the audience with romance. But this is Spider-Man. He's a superhero. The one thing you shouldn't do is focus way too much on the romance and leave the mega-action aside (and I honestly consider this an apt comment). The soundtracks were much, much, much better than the first movie, but what this movie lacks what the first one didn't is an AMAZING battle and the end (or in the middle, just give us some action). Even Spider-Man 3 didn't fail to do that, and that's why I prefer it more. The things that I didn't like were: 1. Spider-Man changed his costume, and for no apparent reason. 2. Just like the previous one, many of the scenes shown in trailer are not put in the movie (e.g, Oscorp has put you under surveillance, etc.). 3. After the movie ends with a high note, an un-intriguing tune (like the one from the old superman movies) is played. God, I hated that. 4. Please stop torturing the audience with the truth about Peter's parents, because that's not why people watch superhero movies. 5. Peter breaks up with Gwen, then makes up with Gwen, then breaks up with Gwen, then makes up with Gwen, and ultimately, she dies. Yes, the movie is good with the unexpected scenes and all that... but if you're going to make more Spidey movies like this in the series, better rename them to ""The Not-so-Amazing Spider-Man"".<br/><br/>And one more thing, which I must say, is that the reason Sony rebooted the Raimi movies was because HE COULDN'T MEET THE ENDS BECAUSE OF THE DEADLINE GIVEN (FYI, He was given just two years). He asked for a year more but was not given. Succumbing to pressure (because he had to make a final Spider-Man movie after the forced Spidey 3 movie, which would've been, how do I put this... oh yeah, AMAZING!) , Raimi gave up, because he didn't want to make just a movie in such a little time. He wanted to do much more than that. Now that The Amazing Spider-Man series has made the web crawler SUFFER when it comes to box office records, guess what, they have been given time to think, and the NEXT SPIDEY MOVIE WON'T BE RELEASED TILL THE SUMMER OF 2018! (And for your calculation, that's 4 years!)"
"danamadeus","4","1","5","9 August 2014"," Still not quite amazing, but an improvement
","The sequel to the unnecessarily retold story made only so Sony could maintain the rights to yada yada yada, you already know. When I first saw ASM2, I pretty much hated it. I thought it was slow, overstuffed, and mediocre. That being said, there are some aspects of the movie that are good, that I enjoyed, and make it worthwhile.<br/><br/>One significant improvement is that Peter/Spider-Man's character is much more likable this time. That's not to say Garfield hasn't always been good in the role, it's more to do with the writing in the first movie. In this film, they really capture the humor and wisecrackiness of Spidey, (whereas in the Amazing Spider-Man it was much more sarcastic and mean-spirited). <br/><br/>On the other hand this film, like many comic book flicks, doesn't entirely succeed in creating fully-fleshed out, convincingly motivated villains. It does to some extent with Electro, but his transformation from pretty nice, if weird and nerdy, guy to evil mass murderer is pretty abrupt. However, that isn't all that unusual for the Spider-Man films, as the series' villains' psychology and origins have all been fairly cheesy, (aside from Norman Osbourne in the first Raimi movie). <br/><br/>There were some moments in the film I thoroughly enjoyed; particularly an opening chase scene with Peter foiling a heist and immediately rushing to his graduation, arriving just in time and changing into his gown while forgetting to remove the mask. There are a lot of entertaining and funny moments, particularly in the first half of the film. Somewhere in the middle though, it gets even more melodramatically forced than Spider-man 3. After that point the film really drags for about an hour until it kicks back in for the climax. The film has a serious focus issue, as there are pretty much 3, (maybe 4) story lines. Peter's arc of learning the truth about what happened to his father, Electro's arc, Harry's plot line, and the Peter/Gwen relationship. Harry's story isn't really connected to the others at all, and could've been a whole other movie. <br/><br/>So the Amazing Spider-man 2 is a mixed bag, with some real strengths. The action scenes are well-executed, and the humor is good and very characteristic of Spider-man. As for performances, Fox is fine, Garfield and Stone are still good and share fantastic chemistry, and Dane Dehaan is great as Harry Osbourne. On the other hand, the movie is plodding, unfocused and occasionally pretty dumb. Is it better than the unnecessary retold origin film? Yes. But director Mark Webb and co. still have a ways to go toward refining this series. 6.0/10"

","An enjoyable movie for the average Marvel Fan, but with a very poor storyline. I reckon the first ASM was much better in terms of storyline, plot and character build-up. The ASM re-creation was trying to achieve the origins of a much darker Spidey (albeit a teenager) (possibly following the Batman re-make success), but, it does not deliver on this second one. Hopefully, the third one will focus on that more.<br/><br/>But, the special effects are unmatched, to date! Actually, the special effects keeps one on his/her toes for a good 2 hours!<br/><br/>Well worth watching on TV/home cinema, but not something going to the cinema for (humble opinion)."

","In 2012, I was happy to finally see a Spider-Man movie with a lead that I felt embodied the Twilight characters I grew up reading. The plot itself might not have been anything to write home about, but it was, at least, a good movie and worth the IMAX ticket price I paid to see it. Fast forward two years to the second installment of the re-booted series and I'm practically praying for terrible ticket sales in hopes that Marc Webb and his team of writers have learned from their mistakes with this one. In short, the film was spent mostly circling around Peter's internal conflict to let go of Gwen per her dying father's request as well as Peter's search for answers and some sort of closure with the sudden departure and deaths of his parents as a child. I understand these are two things that needed to be included, but to span the breadth of over two hours worth of running time? Aside from that, we're treated to the Batman Forever-esque depictions of Electro and Rhino (very briefly for the latter) and the sub-par, paint-by-number acting chops of Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/the Green Goblin. Aaaand that's the movie. No, seriously. A few action sequences here and there to at least whet the appetites for the kids and mouth-breathers, but that's really it. I give Jamie Foxx credit for evoking sympathy for his character early in the movie, but overall it was a trudgingly-paced and uninteresting flop of a superhero movie that will either be remembered for doing nothing differently from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films or forgotten for exactly the same reason. 8"
"upcauseway","4","1","5","31 May 2014"," The Most Ilogical Super-hero Movie I've Ever Seen.
","The CGI, bright lights and terrific effects lead some starry-eyed, hard-core Spidey-fans, blind to the fact that there is a vast number of plot-holes and general bad story lines in this movie sequel.<br/><br/>No one was very impressed with the first Amazing Spiderman, neither was I. In fact, I didn't even particularly want to see the film; I just watched it because my friends and I arrived at the cinema and decided we wouldn't watch Lego Movie for the third time.<br/><br/>Electro was the new villain in this movie, and not for a very good reason. Electro had always been obsessed with Spidey, ever since he met him. Years later (present-time in the movie), he meets him again, and Spidey doesn't act as nice as he did to him a couple of years ago. So, naturally, he wants to kill him. It would have been a better storyline if Spidey did something REALLY out of order, but he wasn't mean to him. He was trying to be nice to him and then Electro just had a mental breakdown and started shooting electricity and flying around and what not.<br/><br/>Which brings me onto my next query: Jamie Foxx (can't remember his real name in the movie), tries to mend a pipe, gets electrocuted, falls into a tank of lizards, and suddenly turns blue, can fly, transport, and shoot electricity? At least the Green Goblin and Doc. Oc. had the decency to become a villain through a science experiment gone wrong. I would have even taken a spider that crash landed on earth and made the villain become Venom over this.<br/><br/>Harry Osbourne is dying. From what? And why is Peter Parker not surprised whatsoever? Harry literally called Peter, said ""I'm dying"" and Peter honestly acted like it was an everyday thing. I don't think it was Andrew Garfield's acting, I think it was just bad writing. Then, when he becomes the Green Goblin and things are starting to get exciting, the movie ends.<br/><br/>But every cloud has a silver lining, even if it is a thin one. The graphics and CGI were an absolute feast for the eyes. Beautiful, probably the prettiest effects I've seen in a Marvel movie. The twist at the end was surprising, and definitely made me want to watch the next one, which I think will be a big step-up from this one. The third instalment is the only one that I would like to go and see now. And, I spotted a new acting talent. Dane Dehaan, who played Harry Osbourne, definitely caught my eye. His portrayal as Harry was excellent, and all my favourite scenes were with him (although that might also be because the writing for the scenes with Harry were a lot more interesting than the rest of the movie). His acting was great, and he seemed very comfortable while doing it. I'll definitely be watching out for him in the future.<br/><br/>But the endless number of plot lines, plot holes and bad writing couldn't make up for those silver linings. I'd rather watch a well-scripted movie, than a bad one with good effects. I just hope that the third instalment will be better, because the twist at the end definitely picked up my negative spirit."
"carlsylvania","8","1","5","17 May 2014"," Nice movie but falls a little short of amazing.
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 gets a lot of things right. Awesome visuals? Check. Incessant-but-adorable spider man chatter during fights? Check. The love chemistry between Parker and Gwen is believable. There's a certain energy around those scenes, as well as scenes involving his aunt.<br/><br/>What the movie lacked though was a certain consistency that ties up all these together. Because of this, i sometimes felt like I was watching three different movies. One second it plays like a slow drama. The next its a zippy flip. Sad. Happy. Fun. Serious. The best directors are able to make the transitions between different scenes appear almost effortless. Mark Webb is a good director with a lot of potential. But he is no James Cameron. As such, part of the movie feels rushed or chopped.<br/><br/>The final 15 minutes feel almost like an afterthought. So given all this, would i recommend that people watch Amazing spider man. Absolutely. Yes. It's a little flawed and a little silly at times. But the same can be said about the character.<br/><br/>And in the end, that's why we all love him."

","TASM2 isn't as bad as critics say, that said it's by no means a Good movie. Like The First Reboot, it's clear Sony Made this film so that Disney could not make a play for the rights to the franchise(Which after the great films of the MCU, would that really be a bad thing?) But Unlike TASM1 this film wasn't as fun. It lacked character development, the big 'surprise' emotional climax fell flat and the supposed real life chemistry between AG and ES was absent. This film is dare I say even worst than Spiderman 3, but it had some awesome action sequences and it had it's moments, just like SM3, I can definitely see that some people may like this film even if I found it bland."
"truongthh","6","1","5","14 May 2014"," Horrible movie
","I am so disappointed about this film.It was even worse than the trailer.I mean,if the producers wanted to make spider-man fight against 3 enemies,they should let the villains appeared more than just a few minutes.<br/><br/>The first thing I want to talk about is the villains.Electro looked stupid and Jamie Foxx's performance was terrible.Sony should have found a better actor,someone who is experienced in playing bad guys.His appearance in the battle scenes was too short(10 minutes).The second villain was goblin.The actor was suck(forgot his name already)and his appearance was even shorter(3 minutes).He looks just like psycho who just got out of the asylum.The worst guy was rhino.He should have showed up earlier instead of appearing at the end of movie. <br/><br/>The second thing I wanted to talk about are the taglines and the posters.The taglines said 'His greatest battle begins' .But Spider- man took them down in a few minutes.It wasn't as great as The amazing spider-man in 2012.There was only one villain(lizard)but spider-man had a tough time beating him.The poster was bad,too.It didn't show how great spider-man's battle was. <br/><br/>The last thing I wanted to talk about is the content.The first movie made me laugh a lot and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.But the second one was horrible.I couldn't laugh and after watching half of the movie,I just sat and waited for the movie to end.The craziest thing was Gwen Stacy's death.I mean, she fell from the roof and broke her neck? Couldn't the writer think of a better death for her?Sony should let Sam Raimi direct the next installment.He was the soul of the original spider-man in the 2000s. <br/><br/>One thing worth mentioned:the visual effects"
"JPfanatic93","6","1","5","11 May 2014"," An advertisement for Spidey's future
","Marvel Studios' long term strategy has payed off, so it's no surprise to see rival studios try their luck doing the same. Most challenging for Sony, as they own the rights to a single character: Spider-Man. Fortunately for the studio, Spidey has a wide array of allies and adversaries to choose from to construct a shared realm. Such characters will need to be introduced first to familiarize the audience with their personalities and groom them for solo debuts. The crafting of a larger Spiderverse begins with The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which hosts a plethora of new characters and a threesome of rogues to enrich Peter Parker's life. Problem is, for a freshly rebooted franchise that still needs to prove to the audience the validity of the rebooting process, the time to start such universe building isn't ripe yet. As a result, the second Amazing Spidermovie feels like a convoluted, incoherently structured piece.<br/><br/>In the sequel, Peter Parker has come to terms with his powers and responsibilities acting as New York's guardian, as he struggles to uphold his promise to the deceased father of his love Gwen to stay out of her life to keep her safe from the harm that comes with being Spider-Man. A strong-spirited woman, Gwen is determined to embrace the dangers involved with dating Peter, or to move one with her career. This results in many scenes of engaging lovers' quarrels that reveal Marc Webb's strengths in directing identifiable romantic affairs. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is still solid, though the same cannot be said for the writing of the former, as Peter has moved on from being a socially awkward nerd to a self-absorbed punk. Though his alter ego is modelled after his comic book counterpart more closely and convincingly than ever – webslinging moves, wisecracking puns and all – Peter feels like he has changed a little too much. While Stone's performance remains a joy to behold, Garfield's oftentimes evokes more irritation than affection.<br/><br/>Spidey's knack for getting those he cares about in trouble is proved as he's confronted by three villains in this movie, each with his personal baggage and history that needs some exploration. The main antagonist Electro is given the most balanced bit of background, in which he is revealed kind of as Peter-Parker-gone-bad. A lonely and socially isolated geek, his plunge in a vat of genetically engineered electric eels grants him powers beyond his dreams, but as he hopes to stand out from the crowd, the masses reject him, forcing him to go on a electrostatic rampage to get back at the world. Though Foxx's performance, sometimes over-the-top while at others more contained, leaves something to be desired, Electro's colourful sparkle shows make for a fancy visual style not seen before.<br/><br/>Unlike Harry Osborn. In Raimi's trilogy of movies, Harry was given an arc all his own over the course of three movies. Here the same story is told in a single film, in a much abbreviated form that does no justice to the decades of comics in which this friendship/rivalry evolved. When his father dies as a result of a degenerative illness that runs in the family, Harry gets reacquainted with his childhood friend Peter. An elaborate backstory is only inferred, so it is hard to care about their relationship. Harry becomes CEO of OsCorp where he finds himself thrown into an arena of intrigue, as he tries to find a cure for what killed his dad and will end his life prematurely too. The only cure appears Spider-Man's blood. As the disease starts to corrupt both his body and mind, Harry's friendship with Peter turns sour when his buddy will not help him to acquire that pivotal transfusion. Eventually Harry transforms into the maniacal Green Goblin, hellbent on wrecking Peter's life when he discovers his secret identity. DeHaan proves up to the task of portraying the sympathetic Harry, and he also visibly shows to have a blast playing the Goblin, making his contributions to the acting front more sizable than Garfield's, though both are driven by feeble writing.<br/><br/>Last up is Rhino, whose presence feels more of an afterthought to get that universe building going, as he adds little of relevance to the plot otherwise. Appearing only in the beginning and at the end, donning large battle armour, the character proves an example of how not to introduce characters if you want the audience to invest in them. It is made clear Rhino is the first member of Harry's team of villains, a plot line which will carry over in the next film, as well as in the announced Sinister Six spin-off. This attempt at foreshadowing backfires on this film on its own.<br/><br/>Compared to the trailers, this film feels to be lacking entire story threads that would have driven the plot into a different direction. Scenes between Harry, his father and Peter promised more intricate relations between the characters. Likewise, characters' scenes were dropped, including the introduction of Mary Jane, while others were shortened dramatically, like Harry's secretary Felicia suffered. The fact is, with multiple foes, a tumultuous love life, and a continuing search for his roots and the fate of his parents carried over from the predecessor, there was more than enough substance to the plot already without the studio's obvious insistence of setting up future films as well. Few of the many plot lines get their chance to stand out amidst the convoluted whole that now is The Amazing Spider-Man 2. There's some fine action scenes and shows of superhero spectacle, while the webslinging never looked better. But the film too often feels like coming up short. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 branches off into an advertisement for upcoming films, hurting its own ending, despite the tragic climax which under less padded conditions might have made this the emotionally most powerful Spiderfilm as yet. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is robbed of its right to exist as a separate entity."

","I went into the movie with my expectations a little lower than the first installment and actually was happily surprised that this one was much more fun and written better than the first. While not my favorite Spider-Man movie (that belongs to Raimi's Spider-Man 2) I will say this, this Spider- Man film for sure pulled my heart strings way harder than previous ones. In fact it hit me harder than any other comic book movie ever has. This was all because of ""the big scene"". I'm talking about the clock tower scene.

","'The not-so amazing Spider-Man 2'. Spidey returns for his most most difficult battle yet - cramming as much web swinging, mid-air pirouettes and cheesy (but often cleverly timed) typical Spidey chat lines in a certain amount of time (142 minutes). Even though the special effects of this film will leave you almost on the edge of your seat, the most memorable and enjoyable scenes from Marc Webb's newest instalment of the 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is the refreshing on-screen chemistry between Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield).<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the eccentrically creepy Max Dillon who happens to stumble into his own world of trouble when he is transformed from the geeky Spider-Man loving employee of Oscorp to the easily manipulated, mayhem-causing Spider-Man loathing Electro. Jamie Foxx brought a new feeling to the category of Spidey villains by seeming misunderstood and mentally unable to cope. However Electro is not the only villain who seeks to wreck havoc, the Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) returns in his best form yet. <br/><br/>Yet again the 'Spider-Man' franchise has thrown one too many enemies into the movie. Due to the abundance of villains that Parker has to face, we only get half of the story. In 'The Amazing Spider-Man' we was allowed to look deeply into Dr. Curt Connors'/ The Lizard's (Rhys Ifans) mind and see what was torturing him so much. However having too many evil characters did not allow Webb enough time to develop them enough so we could fully understand them. Maybe for the next film the franchise should take some notes from Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and concentrate on a single brute who wishes to rid Gotham of the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>The public's current favourite heroin, Gwen Stacey, is back looking as good as ever and certainly does not disappoint. If you did not already know (as of the writing of this review) Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield have been dating for over a year, and it definitely shows on the big screen. Webb succeeded more in creating a realistic, awkward but genuine typical teen relationship, teenage boys everywhere are still jealous of Spider- Man but now it is not because of his incredibly envy inducing web-swinging abilities, it is because of gorgeous down-to-Earth girlfriend. The whole reason this cinematic mix-up is worth watching is because the unique couple lighten up the atmosphere of the film that will make you feel you are right in the middle of them."

","I was actually quite impressed with the first Amazing Spider-Man film so I cannot wait to see the sequel. When I did, I loved every single minute apart from a few gripes, which I will get into.<br/><br/>First off, Andrew Garfield is once again outstanding as our friendly, neighbourhood war crawler. His Spider-Man is more in homage of the Spider-Man from the 60's with his wise cracks and costume (Which I'll have to admit is far superior then the costume from the first TASM)<br/><br/>Emma Stone is good as always and the chemistry between her and Garfield was outstanding. Hands down the best romance I've seen in film of recent years.<br/><br/>Now the villains.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx NAILS it as Electro, he, in my opinion, gives the best performance of the film. You can feel pretty sorry for the guy prior to his transformation.<br/><br/>Dane DeHann was quite good as Harry and I was actually rooting for him when he gets his revenge on the Oscorp executives. However, I felt his little Goblin transformation towards the end was rather shoehorned.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti's Rhino could have easily been saved for another film as his screen time is rather short.<br/><br/>My gripes have to be the fact that A) There was a bit too much going on. And B) It did felt rather slow at times. And C) When Gwen mentions her Oxford future, its pretty obvious on what is going to happen.<br/><br/>Other than that, I thought the final result was good.<br/><br/>I do highly recommend it."

Every minute was entertaining from start to finish. Not a dull moment in sight, you would realise it is 2 hrs 20mins. Andrew Garfield nails his role as the web crawler. I was worried this movie would be overcrowded with villains, but the writing and direction handled this superbly. With hints the Sinister Six to come in future Spidy movies, this franchise is looking to create a world more rich and in depth with one single hero compared to what has been done with other Marvel franchises."

","i was already a few minutes late when I entered the theater, the screen was showing a fight between Richard Parker and the pilot. I don't know what I have missed,but I am assuming it was Peter and Harry's history, because otherwise I have to complain a lot about the lack of their background story. when it was done, I remembered Shakespeare's quote,""better love and lost than never at all"" (I don't know if it's in exact words), i think it was one of the things this movie is trying to say to, through Gwen's death and all her speech about hopes and dreams and even when you fail what better lives to live. the thing about this movie is it would be awesome if you fast forward into the last hour, when it was all special effect, dramatic soundtracks, action, and the most emotional part of this movie of course, you know which part. i was bored in the beginning, the plot holes, the clichés, the failed humor, UGH IMAGINE MY HORROR. i feel they overdo the humor slipped into action style, if I was the villain, spiderman would be dead just 30 minutes into the movie, it didn't make any sense at all especially for the rational peter parker. here, they were also trying to dive into the emotional part of peter parker, i think they want to somehow recreate the cliché selfless hero complex, 'if you love the girl, let her go for her own safety', which was also done in the spiderman trilogy but here, it failed miserably. halfway into the movie, peter suddenly so open with his love for gwen, he even wanted to follow gwen to england and 'webbed' an I LOVE YOU in the bridge, but they didn't connect that points very well, his emotion and what make him changed his mind, are all lost in the action, i didn't get it, they blame it on how peter felt everyone in his life lied to him, he needs gwen to share the burden, but how come the selfless boy we see in the beginning change so fast i didn't even see the change in less than one hour of the movie which at least 30 minutes of semi-action sequence! all the clichés and predictable twists. they too focused on the action part, the dramas weren't handled well and I feel it was to much and some of them are unnecessary."
"anthonymora2","5","1","5","4 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","So to kick off the much anticipated summer movie season, Spidey swings back around for his 5th theatrical release in the last 15 years. So this time around, Peter Parker is on the cusp of figuring out why his parents left him all those years back, meanwhile, his relationship with Gwen Stacey is shaky and he has to decide whether it's safest to break it off or continue on with her. ALSO, Jamie Foxx plays Electro, the statically charged new villain who is causing mayhem AND things with the Osborn family and Oscorp are taking an insane toll, physically and emotionally, for Harry Osborn. There is A LOT going on in this movie, but is it good? Well it's definitely not bad, the best part of the movie is Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man; he can perfectly balance being a funny smart ass, and also tone a strong emotional side for the more dramatic moments. The chemistry between him and Emma Stone (also pretty good in the movie) is really good as well, you really believe the love between the two, even though it can get a bit much at times. Jamie Foxx as Electro was also really cool, which brings in mind the special effects and action scenes. The movie looks good and sounds great. Anything scored by Hans Zimmer is awesome. Now there are a good amount of problems; like I said before there is A LOT going on in this movie. It feels really condensed at times, mostly during the end, which was intense, but so much happened so fast. And the previews for this movie are the exact reason why I stay away from previews as much as possible, like %70 of the movie is in the trailers, that's not cool! The villains, other than Electro are seldom used, literally. This is obviously a build up for part 3, so I'm not gonna whine too much, but there was still a cluttered feel to the movie. It's still very fun, with some really good acting, Dane DeHaan was gold. It's just as good as the first Amazing Spider-Man, but still not as good as Spider-Man 2 or other comic book movies."
"YasheshJ","7","1","5","4 May 2014"," A tried and tested formula film that will deliver gold at box office.
","The sequel to Amazing Spider-Man is a tried and tested formula film that will deliver gold at box office. Other than raking big bucks, it has its share of weaknesses and good points but there is nothing 'amazing' about it as such.<br/><br/>Spider-Man continues his struggle with himself, his life (love and otherwise), conclusions, and pretty much everything a normal adults does. This makes him a superhero everyone identifies with easily (perhaps the reason there is never an apparent overdose of Spidey).<br/><br/>Strong points of the film: Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey: Emma is a vivacious actress who lights up the screen every time she enters the frame. Personally, she was the reason I actually decided to watch the first film when it clearly seemed unnecessary. The sequel has her carry on the good work; she and Andrew Garfield together, still sparkle. In fact she is what keeps Spidey grounded and thinking clearly. Without her guidance, we all know how confused our web-slinger gets.<br/><br/>Supporting cast: primarily Dane DeHaan (Harry Osborne), Aunt May (Sally Field), and Paul Giamatti (Rhino) deliver strong performances, even though they had very minimal screen time to make any more impact. Osborne looked the right amount of ominous and can be looked forward to in upcoming films.<br/><br/>The final 10 minutes: sum up everything a Spidey flick is all about, and energizes the audience. With no hope of deliverance, a kid picks up the mantle against an undeniable threat; Spidey gets over his slump and get back in the battle field.<br/><br/>Other than these, Garfield does well as Spidey, the film starts off pretty well too, and there are some good laughs here and there. After a long time, got to chance enjoy an effects laden film in good old 2D, thoroughly enjoyed the 3D-less experience.<br/><br/>Weak points of the film: Script is in complete disarray, and no matter how perky a chemistry Stacey-Garfield share, there is no salvation for a film scripted this poorly.<br/><br/>Electro: Jamie Foxx simply...well, sucked—such a waste of potential. Rhino in his few minutes looked a much better villain.<br/><br/>All in all a decent one time watch. You enjoy it and the same time wonder what is the need of continuing with the franchise.<br/><br/>Upcoming film: Sinister Six have been given a sneak preview: Doctor Octopus, The Vulture, and Mysterio are more or less going to be unleashed. Rhino and Osborne look promising, others better be good because with Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey) departing from film there may be no saving grace for film, unless it is perfect.<br/><br/>Post-credit: there is an X-Men: Days of Future Past scene that runs after the credits. It has a young William Stryker, Mystique, Toad, Spike, Ink, and Havoc. No apparent connection with Spider-man'a next film.<br/><br/>7/10 P.S., of course, Stan Lee has a cameo!"

If you love Visual Spectacles and don't care much for anything else, you'll love this. + Dane DeHaan is without doubt the best actor in the movie portraying Spidey's arch nemesis Green Goblin once again in the form of Harry Osborne + Andrew Garfield is again solid as Peter Parker with his quick witty jokes + Emma Stone! + The Action Sequences (especially with Electro) are unique and cool in the sense they are like straight out of a comic book or a video game!<br/><br/><ul><li>Plot is the weakest point of the movie. It's filled with too many characters and strays in too many directions some of them setting up future movies than trying to make this one better. Peter's Parents which was supposed to be the focus of the reboot turns out to be too cliché. Romance feels forced and awkward. - Electro, the supposed main villain turns out to be not so amazing. He was always ridiculous in the first place IMO. Even this re-imagining does exactly nothing to change my opinion. - Rhino is a complete joke! Nothing more to say. - Soundtrack was a mixed bag, while the songs were good, the BGM was too loud and distracting and sometimes out of place. - Climax was overwhelmingly disappointing (talking about the final action sequence and its consequence, not the childish scene that happens later)</li></ul><br/><br/>This obviously leaves me with less interest in the sequel, but I'll be keeping an eye on the spin-off Sinister Six movie!<br/><br/>★★★☆☆ 3.5 out of 5 stars"

It's understandable because the 'farewell Gwen. Welcome Mary Jane' time has come. <br/><br/>Electro is there for nothing. A very good character like Harry Osborne was wasted with 'I got a disease- i want to destroy everything' phenomenon. Seriously? the villains purpose in this film didn't convince me at all.

","Consider Christ in the Garden of Gethsemene.

Which is what makes this film, in one sense, a very powerful story and a strong addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this film is suffering from the same affliction that ""Spiderman 3"" did: sub-plot-itis.<br/><br/>We have Max Dillon, an electrical engineer with serious social issues who becomes Electro, Harry Osborn, Peter Parker's friend who eventually becomes the Green Goblin, and then we have the whole Peter-Gwen Stacy- Spider-Man trio going on all at the same time.<br/><br/>There's one more villain that gets thrown in at the very end, but let's not beat a dead horse. It seemed that the people at Sony and Columbia Tristar have forgotten the lessons that forced them to reboot the Spider-Man franchise in the first place.<br/><br/>Make it, and fans will come.

"Christian_Dimartino","6","1","5","2 May 2014"," It's very flawed, but it works well enough.
","I attended the 11:00 p.m. showing of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 last night, and had planned on writing the review the next morning. Much to my surprise, things didn't quite happen like that. Once the movie was over, my friend and I exited the theater and then discussed how mixed we were on the movie for an entire hour. This was at around two in the morning. A day has gone by, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 still has me so torn.<br/><br/>Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man, as wonderfully surprising as it was, was unnecessary, mainly because the studio only waited five years to reboot Sam Rami's Spider-Man movies (I personally would like to see those continued, but, whatever). As unnecessary as it may have been, it actually turned out to be the second best Spider-Man adventure, ranking behind Rami's perfect Spider-Man 2 (sue me, I don't care, it's amazing). What brought the movie to life was the chemistry between Peter Parker/ Spider-Man and Gwen Stacy (on and off-screen couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone). They worked so well together that I was tempted to hug myself. Webb, who's only other non-Spider-Man movie is (500) Days of Summer, knows what he is doing when it comes to the romance. Also, Garfield is perfect in the title role; a worthy replacement for Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>Now, Webb returns with the sequel, and Stone and Garfield are as charming as ever. In fact, they just might be the greatest comic book couple of them all. It's a bold statement, but a true one. The visual effects are spectacular and the entertainment value is high. Also, there are some strong moments here. There were times when I let the action carry me away, and these times were reminiscent of the other movies. But yet, there were a few short time periods where the movie was so bad that I felt like my soul was being shanked. <br/><br/>The sequel picks up some time after the original. Peter Parker is still trying to fight crime, while protecting the ones he loves. Peter and Gwen are still dating, which leaves him with a guilty conscience. If you remember from the previous movie, Peter promised Gwen's late father (Denis Leary) that he would avoid her at all costs. He doesn't do that, until he begins seeing Captain Stacy everywhere. He is also still trying to figure out what exactly happened to his parents and how they were involved with the sinister Oscorp company.<br/><br/>If that wasn't bad enough, just wait. Enter Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a grown-up Steve Erkel who becomes obsessed with Spider-Man after he rescues him. Dillon, an Oscorp employee, soon falls into an eel tank, gets stung a lot (duh), and becomes Electro. Judging from that last sentence, I wonder how Oscorp is still a running company. It clearly isn't a safe work environment. Anyways, Electro, who can manipulate electricity, is pretty cool and one of the movies many visual marvels, but his motives for killing Spider-Man (Spider-Man doesn't remember him) are weak.<br/><br/>Then, enter Harry Osbourne (Dane Dehaan), Peter's childhood friend and son of Oscorp founder Norman Osbourne (Chris Cooper) who carries a very distracting Hitler haircut. Seriously, that haircut drove me crazy. When Harry becomes terminally ill, he believes that Spider-Man's blood can save his life. So, let's just say, he wants Spidey dead too. Harry certainly is an interesting character, but had Dehaan done what he did with Chronicle, then the performance would've been remarkable. Instead, Harry is just whiny (he has a temper tantrum) and, well, his haircut is obnoxious. I'm not letting it go. <br/><br/>TASM2, like the constantly bashed Spider-Man 3, has a little bit too much story and just a bit too many villains, but it works. Also, the action sequences are a knockout, and Garfield shares some sublime moments with Stone and Sally Field, who plays his Aunt May. While a good amount of it does work, it is kind of a bumpy ride.<br/><br/>The scenes with Dillon talking to himself are awkward and occasionally dumb. In fact, Electro doesn't become cool until the final hour. But he is quite the special effect. The soundtrack is bizarre, and the score doesn't always mesh well with what's happening on-screen. Spider-Man himself seems a little too jokey this time around. Sometimes, he tries so hard to be funny I'm surprised the crowds of people ""oohing"" and ""awing"" didn't hand him a microphone.<br/><br/>Not to mention, Paul Giamatti's brief performance as The Rhino is inconceivably dumb. If he is the lead villain in the next round (there's supposedly two more movies coming out, at least), then you may just have to count me out. Giamatti is a great actor, but his accent is too difficult to take seriously. Also, there are a few loose ends that need to be tied up, and some of them probably won't be in the sequel.<br/><br/>Lastly, the movie would've been better had the ending not dragged on. Had the movie stopped at a certain point, then it would have had more of an effective and poignant ending. Instead, the movie wants to get everyone jazzed up for round three, so it sets up the next movie and not very well. <br/><br/>There is more wrong with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 than right, but yet it still gets my recommendation, I guess. How? Well, its target audience (Spider-Man fans) will go for it. Being one of them, I enjoyed a good amount of it. Yes, it had its ups and downs, but it is still an enjoyable movie to some extent. It's a close call though; if round three is a similar movie, then expect harsher criticism. Whether we like it or not, more Spider-Man is coming. <br/><br/>B-"

","I wasn't up for a reboot of the Spiderman franchise prior to this movie & after seeing it, it did change my opinion but only just. And I'd describe that with some pros & cons.<br/><br/>It was a very efficient adaptation and I appreciate that about it. In addition to web-slinging, wall crawling and a Spider sense, we also get witty banter with villains and criminals alike as well as a suit upgrade. As a huge fan of the comics as a child, my biggest attractive characteristic of Spiderman is his ability to churn up amazing one-liners with super-villains even in the midst of unfavorable circumstances. In the previous movie, the attempt at this was a hit and miss and very tacky at best but Andrew Garfield seems to have done his homework with this one.<br/><br/>All actors did a very good job. I didn't find the non-action sequences a drag & they did well to drive the movie forward. My star performer is Jamie Fox as well as Sally Field.<br/><br/>As for the tone, Spiderman is not Batman and most certainly not the dark knight either. A brilliant teenager with spectacular superhuman abilities on the big-screen... In my opinion, its allowed to be a bit over-the-top and not quite as childish as other reviewers claim.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the big screen effect could have been more amazing without half of the movie being included in the trailers. There was no room for surprises. Non whatsoever. Not even in the climax battle. If for anything, the end battle was anti-climatic as I've seen it in the Trailers over & over again.<br/><br/>The worst part for me was the climax battle. It was so crammed up you could hardly figure out what's happening anywhere. It just seemed like a skits show of visual effects blitz.<br/><br/>Better than previous installments but couldn't match Spiderman 2."

","Spiderman, Spiderman, Does whatever a spider can Spins a web, any size, Catches thieves just like flies Look Out! Here comes the Spiderman. <br/><br/>We all love this theme song from the Spiderman TV series. Apparently, Spidey loves it too, so much that it is his ring-tone in The Amazing Spiderman 2. As like the previous film, Andrew Garfield's Spiderman is straight off the comic books- lissome, smarty pants, witty, and affable, everyday hero. The people's hero. But is it his greatest battle? Not really, even though he had to stop Electro, Green Goblin and the Rhino, all in the same movie. <br/><br/>Like most superheroes, Peter Parker's struggles are within himself, to balance his obligations for his friends and family and his extraordinary responsibilities to New York City as Spiderman. With the back-story kind of done with in the first movie, director Marc Webb does not waste anytime but cuts straight to the chase. And chase it is in a breath- taking sequence as Spiderman saves bystanders, cops, foils a plutonium robbery while talking mushy with Gwen Stacy, at the same time. Things are not all hunky dory though, with Peter consumed with guilt over the possibility of Gwen being exposed to his adversaries, and his continued disturbance over his parents' disappearance. Adding to the volatility is the origin of his perhaps his most popular foe, Electro, and the emergence of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn.<br/><br/>First the good- it is a great thing whenever Spidey is suited up. For when he does, he is either inducing guffaws with his one liners, or taking us on a roller coaster ride with his slow motion acrobatics and creative uses of his web-slinging capabilities. Andrew Garfield is a GREAT Spiderman, full of joi de vivre. Radiating nervous energy and childish enthusiasm, his chemistry with Emma Stone's Stacy is excellent. The visual effects are amazing, and the villains are suitably over the top, with Jamie Foxx's Electro getting maximum screen time, a hilarious Paul Giamatti as Rhino, and Dane DeHaan who turns into the murderous Green Goblin by the time you blinked. New Yorkers seem to love a show clapping and cheering their hero, and like a pro wrester, a show it is that Spidey gives them, every time a maniac pops up. People familiar with Spiderman canons will know the fate that awaits Gwen Stacy and so the rest of the movie plays out like a sappy teen romance drama, and largely a popcorn affair.<br/><br/>The bad- there is too much happening. Two is company, three is a crowd. Three villains is an overkill, though in deference, Rhino just makes a special appearance in this, promising more in the next film. The narrative suffers from being the second movie in a planned trilogy, as a result it asks more questions than it answers. What is up with Richard Parker? What secrets will the hidden laboratory hold? Who is the man in the hat? Why is Oscorp the center of all mayhem? <br/><br/>There is a deluge of superhero films, and I have a feeling The Amazing Spiderman 2 will get lost in the crowd, because it is good, but not great. No worries though, redemption coming right up in 2016, and villain list is set to include the Rhino, Vulture and Doc Ock- 7/10"
"alexbeene","7","1","5","1 May 2014"," ""Amazing Spider-Man 2"" swings into better territory than its predecessor
","When Sony decided for a quick reboot of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise back in 2012, the reactions fell into two camps: one which viewed the production as a shameless cash-grab way for the studio to retain the film rights to the character and the other being intrigued and relieved by new blood being brought in after Tobey Maguire and company's lackluster third outing.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was a reasonable success critically and commercially, and Sony quickly targeted the 2014 summer movie season to begin with its sequel. This second installment starts where the first left off. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is still on the hunt for answers to what happened to his parents, while trying to balance the new superhero gig and a complicated relationship with Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone).<br/><br/>As with round one, the real highlights are in the puppy love bits between Garfield and Stone. The two have a quirky chemistry that's bolstered by the offbeat humor both bring to their respective roles. Garfield in particular shines in the most trying of moments for his character that require more tears than webbing.<br/><br/>Of course, no love story can come off perfectly. A new array of baddies are on the hunt for our hero, including Electro (Jamie Foxx) and younger Green Goblin in the form of Peter's old buddy Harry Osborn (Dane DeHann). Foxx's Electro comes off as a tad too goofy to ever be taken as a threat, but DeHann's Osborn is a real seat-shaker, perfectly pitched as a true creep with overwhelming power.<br/><br/>There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, with a genuine stunner in the final moments that will lead to some dropped jaws. The question remains, though: after seeing this latest film in Sony's prized series, which camp is more justified in its reasoning?<br/><br/>While the studio is undeniably banking on the webslinger's worldwide popularity to coast to the $1 billion-mark in box office receipts, director Marc Webb is at least continuing to do his best to bring a youthful, dynamic version of Marvel's biggest hero to the silver screen. There's just enough new drama to keep audiences engaged in what turn Peter will make next.<br/><br/>That being said, at nearly two-and-a-half hours long, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" can still drag from time to time, ironically more in the action than the lower key segments. Proving to be a true contrast to most other films in the superhero genre, it's those romantic moments between Peter and Gwen we crave, and the CGI blasts can often feel in the way of that joy.<br/><br/>It's an upgrade over the first film for sure, and Webb makes sure to dangle some carrots in front of us at the conclusion for future films. While it certainly has its faults, the wall-crawler's latest is an admirable start to the summer movie season for its stellar performances more than its loud effects."
"madpropzeu","8","1","5","30 April 2014"," Great villains, action scenes, and music, dragged down by poor writing.
","I decided to review this movie, primarily because i wanted to state what i feel it has changed since the recent outburst of, in my humble opinion, very disappointing Marvel movies, those being Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and The Wolverine (which was by far the worst of the three).<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is at least two steps up from it's 2012 predecessor, both in terms of flair and substance. The soundtrack is outstanding, but how can you expect less when the great Hans Zimmer is involved? Everyone in the cast was a great fit for their roles, especially the insanely talented Dane Dehaan, who you should definitely keep an eye on. Jamie Foxx was a good choice for Electro, the action scenes with him were absolutely superb and definitely the best part of the movie, however the average and corny writing kept his character from truly shining. The mystery behind Peter's parents and his relationship with Gwen are deeply explored in the movie, although there were many moments where those scenes actually felt more like unnecessary fillers instead of investing you emotionally into the characters and the story. There were however some truly unexpected moments that will definitely surprise you, but without giving any spoilers away, i just want to say that the second half of the movie is definitely better and leaves you wanting to see what the sequel brings.<br/><br/>To give a quick summary of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, it was a movie with very interesting villains, visually stunning action scenes and a superb soundtrack, but it also contained some unnecessary filler scenes that were mainly ruined by poor writing, and even with the 2hr+ runtime it still felt rushed and left me wanting more. I give this movie a 7.5/10."
"MarvelFan123","7","1","5","29 April 2014"," I'd like to think Spider-Man gives people hope...
","I made it no secret that I adore Marvel Comic Books and Spider-Man is no exception so I was really excited to see this movie. Was it good? Yes. Could it have been better? Of course. If you don't understand what I am getting at, then allow me to explain. This leads of course to the flaws first. Gwen Stacy's death was foreshadowed through the entire movie taking great inspiration from Amazing Spider-Man #121 and #122, 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died!' with Gwen wearing similar clothing and Spider-Man and Green Goblin fighting at George Washington Bridge. The reason why the death of Gwen Stacy worked in the source material was the fact that it demonstrated that Spider-Man abilities can't always be effective in many cases and it was Peter Parker's responsibility for Gwen Stacy's death so we can sympathize with him. In the film, The death doesn't have that, in fact it's not a theme within the movie and it's not even hinted at. Gwen Stacy's death is just a death and is not a lesson for Peter to learn going forward. The beginning of the movie focuses on Peter feeling guilt meeting Gwen because of her father dying in the first movie so they part ways because of that. When it comes to her death, Peter learns absolutely nothing and the death of Gwen Stacy already solidifies what Peter Parker already knows and was specifically proved by the break-up at the beginning of the movie. So I was kind of disappointed on how Gwen Stacy's death was handled on the big screen.<br/><br/>Certain techniques of the editing sort of unsatisfied me; sometimes it felt like various shots were just put together one after another, without much of a consistency. This however changed half-way through the movie so I'll consider this a minor flaw. Despite the fact that it's referred to as 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2: The Rise of Electro' in some countries, I think it was a bit unnecessary to specify it as that particular title as Harry Osborn seems to maintain a bit more screen time than Max Dillon. Paul Giamatti as Rhino is considered a minor villain in this case and will expect him to be in The Amazing Spider-Man 3. I'm not judging the Rhino regarding of how much screen time he got, for me the Russian accent seems to be a goofy throwback and is way to over the top. <br/><br/>I will progress onto the good points. The performances I won't go into too much detail considering that the cast were magnificent at their roles. Andrew Garfield for instance, in my opinion portrays Peter Parker almost identically from the comic books. He is smart, witty and responsible in most cases. If you didn't like Peter Parker's personality in the first movie, then you are bound you like him in this case the fact that he expresses his jokes hilariously in many circumstances as it was precisely done in the comic books and he maintains concern and respect towards his close relatives. Also, the way Andrew Garfield in the Spider-Man costume swings throughout New York City is really magnificent as I can recognize the swinging techniques from the comic books. <br/><br/>Also, the cinematography is beautiful to observe and various sequences including Times Square, the final encounter at Power Plant and the death of Gwen was really effective, due to the slow-motion before it and the look in Gwen's eyes before she dies are just good examples of the specified element. The GCI is admirable as towards the end of the movie for instance, Spider-Man and Rhino are running towards each other was a proficient technique, Spider-Man's swinging techniques was amusing and the rest of the action sequences are provided identical treatments. I don't even need to mention the action sequences due to the fact that it's pretty obvious that they are improvements over the first movie in the franchise and that the battle sequences between Electro and Spider- Man are one of the best action scenes in this particular movie; this specifically proves that Marc Webb is enhancing in terms of action/adventure movies. <br/><br/>The soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer was more memorable than the first movie; a good example of this 'I'm Spider-Man' and it is amusing as the film had me humming the theme whenever it was on-screen, and it is a very powerful tune that makes you root for the hero. This film also had good character arcs; want me to give examples? How about the fact that Peter Parker is questioning his decision to go out with Gwen Stacy after breaking Captain Stacy's promise from the first film, Electro being obsessive over the superhero Spider-Man then has deliberate hatred towards him after he accidentally steals the spotlight, or Harry despising Spider-Man and growing more desperate to save himself. Granted, they were a bit rushed but at least the film actually attempted to provide reasonable character arcs. <br/><br/>Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a good film and is sure to please the general audience. Despite its mentioned flaws and comic book accuracy errors, it contains great action sequences, brilliant performances with the exception of Paul Giamatti, good character story arcs, spectacular cinematography, adequate visual effects, a memorable soundtrack and is faithful to the comic book character in some cases. See it if you wish. I give this movie a 6.5/10.<br/><br/>Considering that IMDb only allows me to insert limited amount of characters, I'd recommend that you view my full review on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBJ7B-SGC1g"
"ExpendableMan","7","1","5","28 April 2014"," Very well done if slightly run of the mill
","Given that this is the fifth Spiderman movie in twelve years, it's very easy to feel cynical when the clichés start flying out of the screen before the first action set piece finishes. After all, it's not enough any more that Peter Parker is going to pull an innocent bystander out of the way of a car spinning through the air and be late to an important event which his girlfriend has put a lot of emotional investment in to. Oh no, now he's got to have a dark secret at the heart of his family and be the very centre piece of an evil conspiracy as well. Because having him played by an actor who looks uncomfortably similar to Stan Laurel isn't a big enough difference any more.<br/><br/>However, one inevitable side effect of the sheer volume of superhero movies being made in recent years is that Hollywood has got very, very good at making them. And The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a very, very good movie. It doesn't get close to the high water mark set by The Dark Knight of course but it's definitely a step up from the first entry in the rebooted franchise and could put in a good case for being superior to any of the Sam Raimi movies as well.<br/><br/>Sure, there are faults to be had but the film speeds along on such sheer, good natured fun that it's hard to be bothered by them. As Peter Parker, the annoyingly youthful Andrew Garfield (he's 30 years old people, 30 years old!) is a charming and effortlessly charismatic screen presence. As he zips through New York at high speed, wise cracking at bad guys and high-fiving firemen, you get the distinct impression that he really enjoys being a superhero. There's still time for him to be bothered by guilt and struggle with his responsibilities, but it doesn't weigh him or the film down and he's tremendous fun to spend time with. <br/><br/>He's ably supported by Emma Stone as Parker's on again/off again girlfriend Gwen Stacey. The pair's real life relationship translates incredibly well on screen and there's so much chemistry between them, it's hard not to shake the feeling that both actors want to get the scene over and done with so they can go back to shaking trailers together. Dane Dehaan meanwhile makes a bid for this year's Best Sympathetic Villain In A Spiderman Movie award as Harry Osborn. Dehaan is making a career out of playing traumatised young men with incredible power, but it's a credit to both the actor and the script that he becomes genuinely likable, even when he's committing appalling acts against the people he loves.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is difficult to believe that Jamie Foxx could ever be a nerd, especially as the guy who bullies him at work looks like someone Foxx could break in two by breathing hard enough, but he makes a formidable villain when he inevitably becomes Electro. His Times Square smack down with Spidey is one incredible set piece and their later ruck in a power plant only ups the ante. If the appearance of Paul Giamatti's Rhino on the posters meanwhile has you worried about villain fatigue fear not, he's barely more than a cameo.<br/><br/>So, great cast, awesome set pieces, what's the catch? Well just like the first Amazing Spider Man, this film still can't help but be a bit unnecessary. You'll have seen all of Parker's dilemmas in this before and the needless conspiracy subplot involving his folks never comes across as anything more than a way for the studio to say ""See, completely different film?"" <br/><br/>The strengths outweigh the weaknesses however and aside from a few uncomfortable points (what's with the Mengele style German Doctor?), The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a fine superhero movie. It's great fun to watch, has an immensely likable duo at it's heart and just when it's getting a bit too familiar, it pulls the rug out from under your feet with a wicked third act. If this is Hollywood at it's money grabbing worst, long may it continue."

","Hmm, where to start. I guess good points first: everything is better in spidey 2 than the first part - acting is better, special effect is better, story was more interesting. I don't know why so many of you say Dane DeHaan was not good, I liked him a lot as Harry Osborn. What was a huge waste is Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>And we come to the bad points. The main villain of a movie wasn't even in a movie. He had how much screen time? Maybe 10min of 2 hour movie? And most of that time he was just standing around. Huge waste. Green goblin was another waste. This movie was pretty much villiness if its even a word. Elektro liked spider-man and his motivation was non-existent to hate him, Harry is friends Pitter although his motivation was kinda justified. And movie ending is terrible. It should've ended after Gvens funeral and it would've been perfect, we would have something to wait for next few years, to see how Pitter lives with himself killing his love. But no, he weeps for minute and he is spider-man again. And Rhino.... Jut terrible.<br/><br/>Well I bitched about it a lot, but it was bitching about maybe 15min of a movie, the rest 120 min I really liked. Overall a good movie. Not great, but good."

Don't get me wrong - they do it well; seeing as I had goosebumps and almost cried (for the first time ever at a film!).<br/><br/>But ultimately i came out of the cinema in a foul mood. I was so angry that the relationship between Peter and Gwen was gone for good - in my opinion it was the best thing about the film.<br/><br/>But if you like films where death happens and you're OK with it...go see it.<br/><br/>But for me - this film had tons of potential, then completely ruined it with a pathetic piece of story writing. Wouldn't Spidey have killed himself after, having already said ""I couldn't live with myself if something happened to you because of me.""????<br/><br/>Don't have a clue where the next one could go. I came out of the cinema and kicked the toilet door in fury.<br/><br/>......But at least the film was good enough for me to react in such a way."

I can understand that Gwen died in this awful Spiderman incarnation, I guess because Emma Stone had enough being part of this s*** (what kind of words are ""prohibited words"" here is more amazing than Spiderman, by the way). So, if you just go to the movies to see the ever same action sequences in slow motion, this is the one for you to go, but don't expect any real, consistent story, some sort of niveau or whatsoever.

","Have been a comic book and comic book film fan for a very long time. This film seems geared toward 10 year old viewers - maybe that's where the good reviews here are from. The decision to put Mr. Garfield into the lead role was in a word WEAK. A film with this much resources and following with an unknown actor as the lead - who ever made that decision should be terminated immediately. Jamie Fox's part - due to the script/acting ability or both - was ludicrous. I shut this film off after 15 minutes of viewing. One of the top 10 worst films I've seen in years. As per my earlier comment - even when I was 10 - I would have walked out of the theater in this case. Something must have happened at the executive studio levels to completely ruin a film with this much capital and resources behind it. Getting rid of Tobey Maguire was a fatal error."

The main character should have been someone else, Garfield's acting is superficial, his voice induces feelings of nausea, and he is not believable as Peter Parker. It seems they attempted to TRY and prove him as being Peter by making most of the movie have him being Peter rather than Spider-man. The CGI doesn't look believable also; and the scenes are boring and uninteresting in most cases. Gwen and Peters scenes make me want to fall asleep, they don't have a bond between them at all.

"bora_mustafa","2","2","18","18 September 2014"," Slightly better than the first but still disappointing!!,
","I didn't enjoy the first Amazing Spiderman movie, I thought it was just a lame attempt at trying to revive the series and starting back to the origins story but then they added the story of Peter's parents into it which made it all the more confusing. Despite this I was willing to give the second movie a chance as Spiderman has always been my favourite superhero.<br/><br/>Firstly I am so happy that they changed the costume this time as the first film's suit looked horrendous. Secondly I like the way Spiderman swings through the city as these scenes look far more realistic than the scenes in the Sam Raimi series. However none of that can save the rest of the movie which like Spiderman 3, goes overboard with more than 2 villains with not nearly enough screen time to develop their characters.<br/><br/>A good example is Electro played by Jamie Foxx, he does a decent job with what he's given, however you don't connect with the character because he doesn't really have any motivation for going after Spiderman, in fact Spiderman saves his life early in the film and an unfortunate accident at work (Oscorp of course where else) turns him into Electro and while at first you feel sorry for the guy, his motivation for suddenly wanting to kill Spiderman is not explored very well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Harry Osborne played by Dane Dehaan is not any better, we learn that he is suffering from some sort of disease which has been passed on to him by his dying father Norman Osborne and somehow through some exploring through the Oscorp computer learns that a spider gene could cure his disease which not surprisingly then requests Spiderman's blood which he refuses and he becomes the evil Green Goblin. Again there is not much motivation for Harry to suddenly turn evil let alone being able to work the glider and become the green goblin.<br/><br/>The less we talk about Rhino the better. A lot of the scenes with Peter and Gwen seem to go on forever; yes they do have chemistry and all but we don't really need to keep seeing the two deciding if they want to be together or not. Andrew Garfield's take on Spiderman is decent and he brings all the wisecracks that are common with the character however he makes a horrible Peter Parker, you don't feel sorry for him and he doesn't seem to be going through difficulties in life (with the exception of wondering what happened with his deceased parents).<br/><br/>In contrast to Sam Raimi's Spiderman movies, Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker was far more likable; you wanted him to succeed both at work and his life, and while on the subject where the heck is J Jonah Jameson!!! He was only mentioned briefly in this movie when Peter says that he sent the pictures via E-mail, please how low can you get. Everyone knows that Jameson is very vital in the Spiderman stories as he is the character that makes life complicated for both Spiderman and Parker, but we don't get any of that in Garfield's Spiderman.<br/><br/>Overall it's decent enough, certainly an improvement from the first film but it doesn't touch the greatness of the Raimi Spiderman movies which are far superior, even the much maligned Spiderman 3."

","This starts off with an embarrassing cartoon baddie played by a grunting Paul Giamatti, then has Spidey swing like an arrogant little bastard to his high school (he's a teen?) graduation, where he makes out with Gwen like a rock star. It's either bad writing, or bi-polar, but he depressingly tells her he can't be with her a scene later. Andrew Garfield plays things a bit too hyper and smug, when he's going for charming, but the boy does a fantastic American accent. We are then introduced to a mumbling and campy Jamie Foxx, who feels like he wondered off a Joel Schumacher superhero film set - and there's even an evil German scientist hamming it up with Foxx. This cluttered mess then throws Harry Osborn into the mix and some poor writing tells us he and Peter were friends as kids and not a frame of these two feels authentic. Harry needing Spidey's blood to survive and the strain it puts on Peter, doesn't earn any emotion and feels artificial, like everything else in this film. We are also spoon fed revelations about Peter's father, which are just one giant contrivance. The whole film has a connect the dots feel, with plot points that never feel developed, just forced into a screenplay that feels like studio executive notes not an actual piece of writing. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an empty piece of committee filmmaking with no vision behind the camera. In this day and age of these types of films being pre- visualized with animation in their entirety before a frame is shot, Amazing Spider-Man 2 resembles coloring book filmmaking, all designed and pre-packaged with no artistic flair or soul. Even the music score is dreadful."

","Have you ever watched a movie where every character without exception could have scored lower on an I.Q test than an autistic rabbit? Now try watching one of those movies that doesn't have Vin Diesel in it... It's unbearable. Everything about the amazing spider man 2 is so stupid it boggles my mind that a group of people getting paid millions of dollars thought this stuff up, wrote it down, were OK with it, then everybody they showed it to also was OK with it. Take the ending for example: spider-man fights the rhino. So this idea seems like it could go many ways, but here is what the fine writers behind this movie came up with for it. First off the rhino must be played by an overweight paul giamatti and he must use the most stereotypical Russian accent possible. Next, crowds have to be standing no less than 100 feet away watching as the rhino shoots his .50 caliber machine guns at police officers, and no they do not ever appear worried for their own safety. Then once spider-manchild comes to the rescue rhino better give him a full 30 seconds to make a speech and crack a joke before firing at him because this is a sh!t movie after all. Oh and by the way we don't get to see this fight scene, it cuts off right before the two come in contact with each other. Did I mention this entire scene was in the trailer for the movie. Yeah I don't think anybody involved in this film actually gave a fvck about it in the slightest. Even this score to this movie is laughably bad. Just listen to the dubstep that comes on every time Jamie Fox's villain decides to show up on screen and display his full spectrum of autism for the world to see. I'm sure some 55 year old board room member went ""yeah dubstep. That's what the kids are into... Fvck this movie up with some dubstep guys!"" There's way too many flaws to type in this review, so I'll mention the few pros... Some interesting and well filmed action scenes. Andrew Garfield does really well in this film. That's about all I've got. So yeah this film gets a 4/10. Thanks for ruining green goblin by making him more like a herpes ridden goblin who gives bjs at truck stop bathrooms for whatever money you got in your pocket,"
"andrefarquha","6","1","6","3 May 2016"," The destruction of possible franchise!!
","My first review on this site is of COURSE the second instalment of The Amazing Spider- Man series envisioned by 500 Days of Summer director, Marc Webb released by Columbia Pictures with a screenplay written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinker and James Vanderbilt. It was produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach.<br/><br/>I think many had very high expectations, which is one of the problems I will discuss later from an abundance of trailers that has been pumped towards TV SLOTS in the advertising campaign. One of the amazing things about the sequel, which definitely improved from the previous is the dramatisation. The first 30 minutes of the action flick provided a lot of set-up that was at the right balance and pace. Following a brief opening scene of the titular hero's parents (continued from the first movie), the current picture picks up Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) two years since the death of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Captain George Stacy (Denis Leary), Peter continues his crusade to fight crime as the web-slinger. He briefly humiliated Aleksei Systevich (Paul Giamatti) in a car chase, who with his mobsters were attempting to steal vials of plutonium.<br/><br/>After graduation from HIGH SCHOOL with a moving speech from Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), Peter struggles to maintain his relationship with Gwen and the duties as a superhero while trying to keep a promise from George's dying wish to stay away from Gwen. To not let her daughter get between the responsibilities of crime-fighting. However, trouble brews on the horizon as now Peter as Spidey must deal with the return of Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) and formidable Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx).<br/><br/>What this chapter of Webb's vision of the movie got right was the threat level. It was exceedingly high as the character of Peter has to deal with his inner conflict with Gwen, the lack of a father figure and the physical duress with three antagonists. My problem with the Lizard in the first trial run was the villain lacked a credible motivation and did not pose much of a challenge in terms of scale. The threat was real but not the intensity. A villain on the lackey axis than mastermind axis.<br/><br/>The cinematography and visuals were stunning Sony did a real nice JOB with the special effects and digital animations. There were some mistakes during the edit – I will mention later but Webb's interpretation of the 'spider sense' was smooth. The acting was mostly believable as what cannot be denied is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Foxx managed to pull one head out in the role of the fiery, invigorating, Electro and wear the hat of socially inept and cryptic Dillon whilst DeHaan played a very menacing Harry Osborn.<br/><br/>There were many problems with The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which did not live up to the hype as seen from the trailers. Although many of the performances from the main cast were at the very least satisfactory to brilliant; with Garfield nailing the Peter character this time around. Stone did well as Gwen, though my problem with the performance was Giamatti as Rhino. There was not much left for the actor to play with as the character and his accent as a Russian was too 'hammy' as Giamatti described. The let-down was the script, not so much story but more so dialogue, which affected parts of Garfield's portrayal in places, as well as the comedy being forced.<br/><br/>Unlike Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, the scope of villains for the flick was not the problem. Each nemesis Spidey faced in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had a plausible motivation, which knit together in a joint 'arc'. The main issues were time to unravel major plot points and character development. Leave R.H.I.N.O. out of the picture, but in my opinion, Harry's transition from C.E.O. of Oscorp to crazed lunatic as a result of induced mutation through chemical mutagens felt rushed. The pacing was a lot better this time round but was a bit rapid.<br/><br/>Another one of the many flaws this has is the fight choreography was quite weak here. First round with Electro was too easy (forget the water there is actually a scientific explanation in regard to salts in the water used to short-circuit). I won't even get into the second round and the fight against Green Goblin could of been a bit more of a struggle. It seems a lot more thought was put into the set-up to the eventual formation of the Sinister Six (look this 'team' up).<br/><br/>Performances from Garfield, Stone, DeHaan and Foxx were mostly admirable but were affected by clunky use of crying-out-loud quips of dialogue. Best lines were ""Let's go catch a spider"", ""Yo Sparkles!"" and ""You don't give people hope, you take it away! I'm gonna take away yours!"" Aside from some out-of-place shots and underwhelming fight scenes, the visual effects, set-designs, props and costumes were stunning and the soundtrack was helped to be spectacular thanks to Pharrell Williams and Hans Zimmer's magic, even a nice end-credits wild-track from Alisha Keys and Kendrick Lamar was terrific!"
"davispittman","4","1","6","16 June 2015"," A disappointing spider man film
","This is one of my least favorite superhero films. I don't think Andrew Garfield was a good actor to play spider man. I really thought another actor would've been better suited to play the leading role. Then we have Jamie Foxx, I DID NOT like him in his role, I thought he was very cheesy, nerd like, and I thought he just acted poorly in this movie. I don't think he gave a good performance at all. I did however like Emma stone in her role, I thought she gave a good performance, and I thought she fit the role. The action scenes were pretty good, not great though. I also really liked the scenes with Sally Field as Peter's aunt. I did think those scenes were acted and handled very well. The ending to this film was by far the most disappointing factor in the whole movie! Emma Stone's character Gwen Stacy, Peter's beloved girlfriend, falls to her death, just before it's too late to save her. I realize not all movies get a happy ending, but I thought this ending was crappy and just depressing! Gwen Stacy shouldn't have died! Peter and Gwen should've been able to be together in the end. There were also a couple of other actors that I thought gave mediocre performances. Overall it's a 4/10 at best"
"jamie25693","5","1","6","24 April 2015"," mainly disappointed
","Where do I start?? First I want to say that Paul Giamatti portray of 'The Rhino' was absolutely horrible. I was happy that he was only in the movie for a short period of time. If he was in it for any longer than I would of without a doubt, walked out of the cinema. Andrew Garfield portray as 'Spiderman' is still watchable but the main and only reason I enjoyed this movie is because of Dane DeHaan. His portray as Harry/Goblin was perfect. As soon as I heard his laugh as the goblin was spectacular. But considering that his portray as the goblin was only about 15 minutes long, I thought that was shocking that this new villain with amazing acting skills and bringing the goblin to life only had over 15 minutes on the big screen was disappointing. As for electro I am not even going to comment on his performance, lets just say how disappointing it is."

Apparently I'm in the minority, most folks like to stand around and cheer when billboards are falling from the sky. Stand around and cheer! Yea! <br/><br/>Jamie Fox goes from nerd, to night light, to pure energy? Flowing into light sockets and speaking in a deep voice he decides to take out his years of torment and bullying on all of New York City.<br/><br/>And prepare yourself for continuous on again off again romance between Spiderman and Gwen Stacy. I think it was meant to build drama but it really just annoyed me.<br/><br/>Mostly this movie suffers from no clear drive towards anything.

","Peter Parker's father Richard (Campbell Scott) was a scientist working on a secret project. While Peter was a child, Peter's parents were attacked on a plane killing them but not before he was able to upload a computer file. Peter (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) are graduating from high school. However it's getting too dangerous and he breaks up with her. Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is a lowly electrical engineer working at Oscorp. He gets electrocuted and bitten by an electric eel becoming Electro. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns home to take over from his dying father as CEO of Oscorp and eventually becomes Green Goblin. Felicia (Felicity Jones) was his father's assistant and now is Harry's. Donald Menken (Colm Feore) is Oscorp vice-president. At the end, Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) is turned into Rhino.<br/><br/>Everything is so choppy. It's like the movie needed to hit so many specific plot points. The movie has no flow. The plot developments keep coming and coming without letting the characters breathe. The best part by far is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The movie is better every time they are together on the screen. Without them, I would definitely fail this because this is generally a mess. Jamie Foxx is being a ridiculous cartoon as Max Dillon. As Electro, he's much better. Dane DeHaan is very good but Green Goblin is completely rushed. Again the movie is jamming so much into this. Also I don't know why people keep hanging around to watch as chaos ensues. Electro is wrecking Time Square and people are gathered around to cheer like it's New Year's Eve. There are so many ideas going on like Peter's parents and corporate intrigue. There is enough material for two movies and would probably be better as that."
"brando647","5","1","6","24 January 2015"," A 2 1/2 Hour Commercial for the Next Spin-off Franchise
","THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 wins the title of the most aggravating movie from 2014. It's one of those movies I really, really want to like and sometimes, if I haven't watched it in a while, I can delude myself into believing it was better than I remember. But then I watch it again and it all comes rushing back to me; this movie is unforgivably lame. I wasn't a massive fan of the first AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, where Sony rebooted the series with director Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield stepping into the title role. It was entertaining enough not to discourage me from continued interest in the franchise but failed to recapture the awesome of Sam Raimi's first two films. Leading into the release of AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2, I was excited. Now that we'd gotten the origin story out of the way (again) we could dive into a meatier Spider-Man adventure without the repetitive exposition. Plus they'd scored Jamie Foxx as the main villain and it was apparent they would be bringing the Rhino (one of my favorite Spider-Man lower-level baddies) into the mix with (no joke) Paul Giamatti in the role. The level of excitement was high as May 2nd approached, and then the reviews began to trickle out. The movie was being torn to shreds, but it was all right. I didn't always agree with the critics and summer blockbusters are always polarizing, especially comic films. There was still a chance it could be a fun time. Then I watched it.<br/><br/>There's just so much wrong here, I don't know where to begin. Well, for starters, if you want to get an audience excited to settle in for a nearly two and a half hour long comic film, start with an exciting action sequence featuring your hero. You know, Spider- Man. Not his father. The movie opens with an almost ten minute long action sequence with Peter Parker's father on a plane where the movie reopens a plot thread from the first movie that I never got around to caring about: what happened to Peter Parker's parents. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is, amongst many other things, a continuation of this plot thread. Maybe if the movie focused solely on this thread, it would've kept my interest but the movie drops it immediately after this scene and doesn't return until sometime later in the second act when we've already stopped caring and want to see more of the Electro plot. Oh, rightthe Electro plot. We've got Jamie Foxx as our main(-ish) villain! How could this go wrong? Oh right, the writing. I'm not even sure how to best describe how underwritten Electro is in this film. His primary motivation for becoming a super-villain after acquiring his electricity-based superpowers (following an admittedly cool re-awakening scene in the morgue) is that Spider-Man is more popular than him. Prior to his accident, Max Dillon was a non-entity who went through life as a stepping stone in the path of others. A chance meeting with Spider- Man in the midst of a car chase in the beginning of the film spurs a psychopathic obsession with the web-crawler where Dillon is fully convinced that Spider-Man is his new best friend. Then he gains superpowers and decides he wants to kill Spider-Man because he couldn't remember Max's name. Oh, and he's more popular. Seriously, that's it. Electro's motivation in the movie is to kill Spider-Man because he's jealous.<br/><br/>Oh, and Paul Giamatti as the Rhino? Man, they really pumped up his character in the trailers and TV ads. At least we've got Rhino, a character who's got to be fun because the concept of a man in Rhino armor is too crazy not to work. Well, Giamatti's role in the movie amounts to little more than a cameo. All that time spent pumping the Spider-Man/Rhino battle in the advertisements and we never actually get to see it. It's the opposite issue with the Green Goblin. First, I think it's a little too soon to be returning to the Harry Osborn/Green Goblin well. We got three movies worth of Harry Osborn in Raimi's series and Willem Dafoe was a fantastic Goblin in the first SPIDER- MAN. So I've already got a little bit of Goblin fatigue. Then we shoehorn Harry's reappearance into the new series with absolutely no foundation and we're expected to accept these two are life-long friends when we've never heard Peter so much as mention Harry before. Yes, people who are familiar with the franchise will know of their history and all that, but as a film it's just lazy to cram this new (supposedly deep- rooted) friendship in and expect people to buy into it. The problem is that the filmmakers were more interested in mimicking Marvel Studios' universe-building than putting out a good movie. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 isn't interested in telling a good story or entertaining youthey want to set themselves up for spinoffs and sequels and spinoffs of sequels. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is nearly two and a half hours long and it can be summed up in one scene. There's a moment near the end where Harry Osborn discusses establishing a team. A small team (hmmsix members, I'm guessing) to do, I don't know, bad guy things. A sinister team. Yes.<br/><br/>SINSTER SIXcurrently scheduled for release in 2016.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind so much if the studio had crafted a fun, exciting movie to make us actually want a new spin-off. I'm not exaggerating when I saw that nothing of interest happens in the first hour of this movie. Nothing. You could jump into this movie at the 60 minute mark and you wouldn't have missed anything important. Jamie Foxx and Paul Giamatti were inspired casting, and the effects (especially the Electro effects) were actually pretty good. But THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 never had a chance when the filmmaker/studio went in with the wrong priorities and lazy attitude."

","I really wanted to believe in this Spider-Man. After the reboot the first movie was okay though I still personally prefer the McGuire trilogy. But this movie ate dirt. <br/><br/>It feels unedited. There are moments that drag on where you have time to wonder what the hell they are doing and how this is contributing to the plot or character development (short answer, it isn't). The moments where we see some genuine interaction between Peter and Gwen feel tainted by the same thing. <br/><br/>The ""romance"" of the two is selfish and driven largely by Peter's wants and ego. I didn't like it at all. And as for the rest of the movie... most of the motivations were just off or not there at all. <br/><br/>I gave it a 4 because I feel 5 is too generous.

","The first movie of this rebooted series was a superficial and soulless, with a script full of plot holes. The only fact that made me watch the sequence was the interaction between Garfield and Emma Stone, basically the only good point of the first one.<br/><br/>In the beginning, I really thought this movie could be good, but with the bad development of important characters as Electro and as Green Goblin, the circular plot, in which every bad thing is connected to Oscorp, and a terrible soundtrack, the only thing that came in my mind was that this movie was a complete waste of a good opportunity. They could have based it, at least, in another comic-book story, a good one.<br/><br/>Sadly, seeing where this movie wants to get probably mean the next movies won't present better stories. Avi Arad and his crew should understand that the Spider-Man's universe is not so large as the Avenger's. That's why they should stop trying to expand it. A simpler story, with less villains, would fit better the hero so loved for being common and simple.<br/><br/>P.S.: I'm looking forward to seeing Spider-Man back to Marvel Cinematic Universe."

","Okay but nothing special.<br/><br/>The first Amazing Spiderman was surprisingly good. I liked the Tobey Maguire series and felt that a reboot wasn't necessary. However, that reboot didn't feel like it is covering old ground, and felt fresh, original and energetic. It was interesting from start to finish.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the second movie in the reboot series doesn't really add anything or feel fresh. It is pretty much a formulaic comic book adaptation. The only attempts at character development - the love story - felt weak, and were quite dull and tedious.<br/><br/>This said it is entertaining enough to keep you watching. Not a must- see, but it's okay."

","I may be just about near my limit for superhero movies. Either that, or nothing in The Amazing Spiderman 2 surprised me, or wowed me. It follows the standard formula of Spidey fighting two bad guys (One only introduced towards the end) across New York, a clash between his personal and vigilante life, and his on/off relationship with the only girl who knows his secret identity.<br/><br/>But the fights, banter and plot mechanics, while done well enough, don't leap off the screen at you. Everything feels strictly routine... Even the sad 'twist' towards the end feels tacked-on in the great scheme of things. There's angst, humour and special effects in equal measure, and you won't be bored. It isn't anything memorable though, and certainly doesn't live up to the 'Amazing' monicker in the title.<br/><br/>Still, it could be worse...

","The first film in the reboot series was reasonably good, despite me being skeptical, because I really like the Sam Raim/Tobey Maguire series, so I was hoping it would be the same for the sequel, from returning director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer). Basically Peter Parker (The Social Network's Andrew Garfield) continues to fight crime in the city of New York as Spider-Man, including rescuing Oscorp employee Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), but he keeps seeing visions of deceased Captain George Stacy (Denis Leary) warning him to stay away from his daughter Gwen (The Help's Emma Stone), he wants to keep this vow and the two break up. Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborn (Lawless's Dane DeHaan) returns to the city to visit Oscorp CEO and his terminally ill father Norman (Chris Cooper), his father warns his son he could develop the disease, the next day Norman dies and Harry becomes the new CEO. Max meanwhile is convinced Spider-Man has become his best friend, he idolises him, on his birthday Max is tending to maintenance in an Oscorp laboratory, but he gets electrocuted and falls into a tank of genetically modified electric eels, he is mutated into a living electric generator, he soon wanders into Times Square and accidentally causes a blackout, Spider-Man attempts to diffuse the situation, but angered by his press coverage Max, now calling himself Electro, attacks the hero, until he is stopped and taken to Ravencroft Institute. Harry begins to develop his father's disease, he deduces Spider-Man's blood could be the key to saving his life, he asks Peter to find him, Peter though is unsure what his superhuman blood could do to his health, he tries to dissuade his friend, and as Spider-Man he refuses to help, so Harry hates him, and he is removed as CEO after being framed by board members for covering up Max's accident. Harry learns of equipment that could help him, inside the Oscorp building he finds a suit of armour made by Norman, and venom from genetically altered spiders, injecting himself with it his illness accelerates and he turns into a goblin-like creature, the Green Goblin, but the suit's built-in emergency protocol restores his health. Peter, wanting to find out more about his father's research, finds a secret hidden lab in an abandoned subway station, including a recorded message from his father Richard (Campbell Scott) explaining him leaving, refusing to cooperate with Norman's biogenetic weaponization plans, he then gets a call from Gwen, still his friend, who says she will be leaving for her scholarship to Oxford University in Britain, he finds her and professes his love. Max, who was let out by Harry, causes another blackout that takes out all power to New York city, Peter becomes Spider-Man and with Gwen they confront Electro, overloading his body, killing him and restoring power. Then seconds later Harry arrives equipped with the armour and weaponry, he kidnaps Gwen when discovering Spider-Man's true identity, the two battle in a clock tower, Harry is subdued, but Gwen tragically falls to her death. Distraught Peter gives up being Spider-Man, and for several days beside Gwen's grave, five months pass, Harry heals from his treatment at Ravencroft, associate Gustav Fiers aka The Gentleman (Michael Massee) visits him, and also breaks out criminal Aleksei Sytsevich aka Rhino (Paul Giamatti) who rampages on the streets, Peter inspired by Gwen's recorded graduation message returns to battle the armoured villain as Spider-Man. Also starring Sally Field as Aunt May, Colm Feore as Donald Menken, Embeth Davidtz as Mary Parker, Marton Csokas as Dr. Ashley Kafka, B.J. Novak as Alistair Smythe, Felicity Jones as Felicia and Stan Lee as Graduation Guest. British actor Garfield is still good as both Peter Parker and the superhero Spider-Man being witty, not so much vulnerability though, Stone is nice as the hero's love interest, Foxx is a little cheesy as the villain, at least DeHaan tries to be scary. There are only two problems I have with this sequel, firstly is that it tries to cram in too many ideas at once, and secondly it doesn't know when to stop, you think it's going to end at a particular point, but it goes on for almost two and a half hours, however the action sequences with splendid special effects make it engaging, it is an entertaining fantasy adventure.

This movie has a whole lot going for it. Its got stellar performances by Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and especially Sally Field, who gives probably the best portrayal of Aunt May ever and that includes comic books! It's smart, its dramatic, action packed and at the same time it never forgets it's core message of responsibility, truth and consequences. There is a downside to the film as it pertains to villains though, as I found their motivations to be half baked and shoehorned in. The chief offender being Jamie Foxx who's portrayal of Electro is just cringe-worthy. In spite of that, I have to say that I really liked this movie a lot more than I thought I was going to and it ultimately became a fun time at the theater. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a 3...out of 5."
"chelsmc1693","4","1","6","21 July 2014"," Welll .......it is the amazing spider man.
","Spider man in general is the of those marvel movies that people are not putting a lot of effort into. With that being said is was ....ok. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie was rushed. It was like they were trying to totally disregard the last spider-man movies and quickly introduce you to the new peter, the new love interest( forget Mary-Jane) and new villains. The movie didn't give audience time to soak it all in before.... BAM the story begins and ends.<br/><br/>Acting wise...it was decent. From all the hype about the actors I was inspecting a little bit more. You could tell that some never been in a big time action pack movie. In my opinion I wish they would have chosen some better actors for the main roles. Writing was not that great even the big names in the movie sound like they were desperately (in a failed attempt)trying make terrible lines sound good. <br/><br/>Action-Pack. This is one thing that is never wrong in ANY marvel movie. The movie can suck but the action always good.<br/><br/>Should you see it.... If you want that awesome marvel rush flooding though your veins , NO NO NO NO. Wait for another Avengers or X-Men.<br/><br/>If you want to make you 2 year old spider-man fanatic son happy and just want to get out of the house then yes. But wait until it is in the two dollar movie theater."
"jpkwolf","5","1","6","3 June 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 sadly suffers from many same things as Spider-Man 3
","My expectations for this movie were quite high as I really enjoyed The Amazing Spider-Man. The script and pace of the reboot were good with a great new cast. Based on the trailers I expected the sequel to be even better.<br/><br/>The cast is as great as ever with Andrew Garfield being perfect as Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Emma Stone is still great as Gwen Stacy. She and Garfield have great chemistry going on. Dane DeHaan does good work as Harry. Jamie Foxx feels a bit miscast as Electro but also acts quite well to make up for it. Marc Webb knows how to direct the actors and their scenes feel warm, funny, sad and real.<br/><br/>The movies problems lie with it's slightly too long and uneven script. The script could have used some trimming and polishing. The side plot about the past of Richard Parker feels fairly unnecessary and the pace of the movie is completely off. Sad things to notice as in the first movie the pacing was top notch. <br/><br/>In the end Electro feels somehow under used and quite mediocre as the villain. I'm also a bit disappointed at how the Green Goblin looks in this incarnation. He needs to look more monstrous and goblin like. The final fight with the Goblin is decent but I expected slightly more from this important scene. All in all the battles range from decent to pretty good. The 3D is good and the effects look great.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about the movie is where it leaves our hero, the other characters and what doors have been opened now. Sadly that in itself tells about the flaws of this movie. It feels like the good actors are prisoners of a mediocre and uneven script. Apart from introducing Harry and few plot twists this movie feels somehow like filler material. It's an extremely flawed film but not without it's merits. Hopefully Amazing Spider-Man 3 will have a better and more balanced script."

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is simply Amazing!The effects are stunning,the story was kinda cool also.(I'll get to it later)The chemistry between Andrew and Emma was amazing and the acting was amazing too.Now lets get into the story,shall we?The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has a lot of sub-plots and they are all connected to Peter someway.He has Gwen,Harry,Electro,Aunt May,he wants to know about his parents,and then there is Oscorp.This is the story,Peter Parker's life and how his personal life gets involved into his Spider-Man life.I love that about the movie.But,like all movies,it has a few flaws which is why it gets a 7/10.The story was rushed at some parts,Green Goblin was shoe-horned in for about 5 minutes,3 of them has him fighting Spider-Man.The Planes sub-plot was REALLY unnecessary.And the whole music for Max Dillion was awkward before and during he was Electro at Times square.But,if you can look pass those parts like me,this is the best Spider-Man to date."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","6","14 May 2014"," TASM2 still engages and dazzles despite narrative overcrowding
","As the world's most popular superhero, Spider-Man is the poster hero for the resurgence of the superhero genre at the movies, but these days he's hanging there by a strand of webbing. When Sony gave Peter Parker a reboot in 2012's ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" they became the first studio to recast and reimagine an entire (and lucrative) franchise, and therefore ran the first experiment to test audiences' reactions to a reboot with the original so fresh in their memory.<br/><br/>Results have been all over the board, and they will likely continue that way for ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" With the Spider-Man origin story out of the way, director Marc Webb and a large team of story architects including James Vanderbilt (lone remaining writer from ""The Amazing Spider-Man""), Jeff Pinkner (TV's ""Fringe"") and the infamous blockbuster duo of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (""Transformers,"" ""Star Trek"") had the freedom to explore new ideas and grow the scale of the Spider-Man universe.<br/><br/>As advertised, Spider-Man battles three baddies in this film: Electro/Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) and Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino (Paul Giamatti). Although the film narratively manages to avoid the villain overcrowding of the late-'90s ""Batman"" films and ""Spider-Man 3,"" it's far from ideal.<br/><br/>As with the Lizard in the first film, these villains stem from Oscorp, which truly emerges as evil's central address in this rebooted Spider-Man universe. The opening sequence further establishes Richard Parker's connection to Oscorp, which is completely revealed in this film after being heavily teased in the first.<br/><br/>Along with the villains and their plots and the mystery of Peter's parents, there's Peter himself and his journey as Spider-Man, his journey of discovering the truth about his parents and his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). It's probably enough material for two 90-minute films, but it's presented instead in one 142-minute film. Something does give, but surprisingly, it's not the Peter Parker stuff, or the emotion.<br/><br/>Webb makes the cut as an action director to be sure, but his real strength is in creating character chemistry and realistic romance. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are special together on screen, which might have something to do with their off-screen chemistry, but regardless, their performances – particularly together – are the movie's greatest asset. What could have been a melodramatic roller-coaster subplot really works because Garfield shows us how torn Peter is between his instinct to love Gwen and her father's stern warning in the first film to leave her alone. Stone's Gwen is a strong young woman who acts for herself first, and so her conflicts with Peter aren't petty, but realistic.<br/><br/>But the real testament to both Webb, the casting folks and the writers is the relationship between Peter and old friend Harry, which has just minutes to materialize in a believable manner. DeHaan and Garfield create this honest portrayal of forgotten friendship in only a few key scenes that lead to the crucial turning points of the film. Those turning points are just okay as is, so the work in these low-key scenes proves critical.<br/><br/>Essentially, for all the good work done in character development on Peter's end, the dreadful development of the villains acts as a counter force that fortunately only weighs the final product down so much thanks to the good elements.<br/><br/>Let's start with Electro. Foxx is cast as a one-dimensional version of his mentally ill character from ""The Soloist."" An Oscorp electrician and huge fan of Spider-Man, Max Dillon lives in his own world and suffers from an inability to separate logic from his emotions. Although the character does victims of mental illness no favors, it's plausible that Dillon could become villainous under the right circumstances. That said, the film's circumstances aren't great, particularly in the realm of why the self-proclaimed Electro would want to kill Spider-Man. Electro is a cool villain aesthetically and the special effects are terrific, but he's comparable with Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze.<br/><br/>Although Harry Osborn's motivations make a bit more sense, the film rushes through his character arc. The story asks us to pity him and then despise him with little time to make the transition. DeHaan makes the most of it, however, and shows he has quite the chops for playing a villain.<br/><br/>Plopped in all of this is Peter discovering just what his father was up to for Oscorp and why he left him as a child. What we learn makes total sense and satisfies our curiosity to know, but the information doesn't impact the film's climax in any way. Peter does nothing differently – he still must stop Electro and Green Goblin from destroying New York – and killing him.<br/><br/>It is easy to get lost in story details and plot points and character motivation, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is also as entertaining as it should be, and more so than its predecessor. The camera-work and special effects are the stuff Sam Raimi probably only dreamed of and take the character (literally) to new heights. The use of slow-motion proves to not be cliché, but to actually let the audience see the quality of the effects, the attention to detail. The action also hits harder – PG-13 seems to be getting more and more graphic, which as a 20-something non-parent, doesn't bother me one iota.<br/><br/>With the ""Sinister Six"" – a team of Spider-Man's enemies – coming down the pipeline soon, Sony needs to be a little more thoughtful about how it handles its villains, and they also should consider condensing the many themes and story lines of this new series. With just a bit more focused storytelling, their engaging, thoughtful and entertaining new ""Spider-Man"" could go from good to great, and meet fans' growing expectations of Spider-Man on the big screen.<br/><br/>~Steve C Thanks for reading!

"xjustsomedude23","8","1","6","11 May 2014"," Had a lot of potential.... (Spoilers)
","First of all this movie could've been so much better; it had so much potential. The CGI and action sequences were incredible, the acting was spot on, and they took everything I loved from the comics and gave it a new refreshing take. But I felt like I was watching an hour long sinister six trailer. Not only did the movie take a while to get going, but by the end of it I felt like most of it was just there to set up future movies. And I don't know what they were thinking with all those trailers! They showed way to much of the movie in the trailers, don't believe me? The last scene and first scene were in the trailer! They even had parts in the trailer that weren't even in the movie. And as for Green Goblin, I felt like he was just in the movie to kill Gwen Stacy. He kind of just showed up, killed her, and that was it. I mean Goblin is Spiderman's nemesis! his worst enemy. I would be like the Joker just showing up at the end of the Dark Knight, killing a few people, and then going to Arkham Asylum. If this movie was just written better and paced better then I felt like it would of been a better movie. But overall this movie was fun and enjoyable."

","Saw 3D version of this movie recently. This sequel is far much superior to first part with numerous comic scenes and adrenaline rush action .The Andrew Garfield(>>>>Tobey Maguire ) and Emma stone chemistry is brilliant and is the main attraction of this plot that holds the movie together. Electro's character was dumb.The newly harry Osborn did a fine job ..and Rhino was wasted.The ending scenes showing a glimpse of future Supervillian arouses curiosity about future installments .Summarising the movie is overstuffed popcorn flick .The writers need to hold the script tighter and smarter in next part (like captain America 2?) to save this franchise from falling apart .Good luck"
"ksaraswatin","8","1","6","11 May 2014"," Amazing Electro and goblin
","Not a single dull moment in the movie, Andrew Garfield pulls the Comic Spidey out on the screen like a pro. The movie packs a lot of funny conversations of peter with Aunt May, Gwen and Dillon. But the show stealer is definitely spidey versus electro battles. The way Electro is born and how he unleashes his anger on Spider-man feels like your in a video game. Movie unleashes,spider-man world characters of Goblin & Rhino, but if you watch carefully you will see there are some hidden glimpses of other too. Perhaps you may even feel it like reading a comic book.<br/><br/>One of the visual delight of the movie is Harry Osborn's transformation to Green goblin. His friendship with Peter and then Anger against Spider man for not helping."
"JoeyCelia","8","1","6","10 May 2014"," Already better than the originals
","Being a Spider-Man fan I was very much looking forward to watching this movie. After seeing how much better the first one was than the originals... I couldn't wait to see this one. Well, it was definitely worth the $15 dollars (the additional 4 dollars because of it being in 3-D) I enjoyed every second of it. If you are familiar with the comic books you unfortunately are going to know what happens. But it adds to the story and the ending makes you wonder about the future. Dane DeHaan played a Fabulous portrayal of the Green Goblin... Better than William Dafoe? I don't know, it's a possibility. You be the judge. Paul Giamatti played a good criminal/Rhino when he had the chance to be on screen (which was rarely). And Jamie Foxx did a tremendous job as usual playing as the loner Max a.k.a Electro a.k.a bad ass super-villain. This movie makes you think big time about the future of Spider-Man and also... Who his future opponents are going to be. I extremely recommend watching this in 3-D."
"alindsay-al","8","1","6","9 May 2014"," a fun action packed spidey film for everyone to enjoy
","This film has been receiving a lot of mixed reviews from average movie fans and also the critics and I must say I can see both points of view, however, I really liked this film. The film picks off where the last one ended peter and gwen are still in there awkward relationship and his best friend harry Osbourne has returned. Also in this by an accident the supervillain electro is created. With all this the film can feel a little bit overcrowded with all these tie ins but overall I thought it handed it okay. Once again a great point of this film is the chemistry between Emma stone and Andrew Garfield it's great and one of the best parts of the film to the point that there is one point in this film where it got quite emotional and really made this film a great film in my opinion. Whereas in my opinion villains in previous spider man villains have just been villains for no reason there is logical reasons why both characters would want revenge on spider man, Jamie Foxx is good in this film as electro but the scene stealer is Dane dehan as harry Osbourne he was my favourite character of the film. The biggest negative is that because of the insane levels of marketing for this film it just doesn't live up to the hype of it and important parts of the trailer aren't even in the movie! Also towards the end it does feel a little long and like they are just totally setting up for sinister 6 and s3 which I hope are good. In my opinion this film is worthy of being a spider man film and is great"
"RevRonster","8","1","6","8 May 2014"," There's some problems but Spidey's still good in my book!
","While there were elements I enjoyed with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films (yes, even in the third. As awful as that one was, the special effects on Sandman were incredible), I found that I infinitely enjoyed ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" much more. So, I was a little bit excited for this next go-aroundand I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The critics may not be digging the film but Spider-Man has been a big part of my life for a long time—actually, superheroes in general have been a big par of my life. While Tobey was a decent Spider-Man, I never felt he really fit the character I knew from the various cartoons and comics I grew up with. When Andrew Garfield stepped it, I saw an actor who nailed the geekiness, the cockiness when the mask was on and the awkwardness when it was off, and, most importantly, could nail those corny one-liners Spidey always tossed around. Garfield keeps that spirit alive and keeps the chemistry he has with costar Emma Stone.<br/><br/>The new additions to this sequel, like Dane DeHaan as Green Goblin/Harry Osborn and Jamie Foxx as Electro, fit right in. DeHaan was impressive as Harry and made James Franco's portrayal of the same character look weak (even though Franco was one of those elements I really liked from that trilogy) and Foxx was just awesome as Electro. First off, it was cool to see the character of Electro hit the big screen because it was a refreshing sight to see this villain make the jump to the big screen and not another one of the fellows we've seen before and the way the writers combined the established Marvel character with Marvel's ""Ultimate"" Electro really made for an exciting villain for Spidey to face. When you combine that with a great performance from Foxx and killer special effects, you have a recipe for some fun, exciting stuff.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I had about the film was the fact director Marc Webb couldn't balance a story that was inherently both a sequel and a springboard for the upcoming spin-off for the Sinister Six. Both elements are at play as we see Peter/Spider-Man evolve and deal with his personal relationships and his responsibilities as a hero and we see the depths that Oscorp is going and a plan that Green Goblin is hatching to stop Spider-Man that will culminate in the Sinister Six film. This ended up causing some of the parts of the film to feel rushed or tacked on and it also rode the line of hitting the same problem that the third, jazz-dancing film had: Too many villains. Along with Green Goblin and Electro, the film also has The Rhino coming in to make a cameo and, even though he was there for the Sinister Six setup, it might have been too many villains—especially when you include that other Spidey comic characters have cameos along the way. However, being a geek, seeing Rhino come to life on screen was too cool and this complaint is so minor for me that it is pretty much nonexistent.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I really enjoyed ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" While the story may have some hiccups, it was still fun, funny and had just the right amount of drama where it can be moving and touching but not a two-hour, ""Let's watch Spider-Man blubber and snot on himself"" film like Raimi's trilogy. Additionally, the film had tremendous sound and awesome music that really helped create the tone—the music played for Electro really helped sell the confusion and frustration the character is going through. Finally, the action is fast and never boring. Overall, I feel this was a great addition to the rebooted franchise and I'm excited for the upcoming spin-offs and sequels.<br/><br/>Good afternoon or evening or morning!

","If you're a fan of the new cast, new suit, and new story line in this reboot sequel, then TAS2 will not disappoint. My only dislike is Hanz Zimmer's failed approach to score a franchise who should have kept James Horner on board after his memorable and heroic theme he created for the Amazing Spiderman. If Horner scored TAS2, then this picture would have been a ten out of ten. Despite the music, this film has great action, heart stopping performances from cast, and earns a solid A + for the flawless visual and special effects. Won't win best Picture, but definitely worth seeing in theatres in 3-D as summer approaches. First comic book adaptation to get it just right in a motion picture in awhile."
"ersinkdotcom","8","1","6","7 May 2014"," Successfully follows up the first chapter with tons of dizzying excitement, romance, and superhero fun
","I have to tell you that I had absolutely no expectations walking into ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" The trailers and teasers for the movie never pushed any emotional buttons for me. Although Marc Webb's second film in his series was looking to be overstuffed with villains, I never made any negative mental comparisons to Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3"" because I actually liked it.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is having trouble in his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). The constant reminder of his promise to Gwen's father (Denis Leary) makes it virtually impossible to keep a clear conscience while courting his high school sweetheart. Meanwhile, a timid worker (Jamie Foxx) for OsCorp is transformed into a dangerous electrical force bent on draining New York City of its power and gaining notoriety through his acts of terrorism. The wall crawler also finds himself going head-to-head with both the Goblin (Dane DeHaan) and the Rhino (Paul Giamatti) as they seek to satisfy their own diabolical agendas.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" sounds a bit hectic. The biggest question on everyone's mind is if the villains all feel jammed into the movie. The answer is yes AND no. There are times when it feels like the characters were shoe-horned in to make way for the much-talked about ""Sinister Six"" movie. At other points, everything feels cohesive and not forced. Harry's transformation in particular seems a bit hurried, but not enough to ruin the viewing experience.<br/><br/>I've heard grumblings about ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" being considered nothing more than a gateway or segue way to the ""Sinister Six"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 3."" I did get that feeling at times. There was an underlying vibe I could compare to ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" and ""Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones."" They existed because they had to in order to bridge the gap between two other pieces of an epic puzzle.<br/><br/>I will say that some of the dialogue and acting in ""The Amazing Spider- Man 2"" lacked. Dane DeHaan seemed a little out of sorts at times with his performance as Harry Osborn. Surprisingly, Jamie Fox did a great job adding humor to his character of Max Dillon/Electro. There were spots where his dialogue veered into corny territory as well. It's hard to blame dialogue problems on anyone but the writers, though.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action/violence. There was also some bad language. If you and your children were fine with the first movie, this is really no different when it comes to content. It gets a little intense at times, but my seven year old handled it well.<br/><br/>As far as sequels are concerned, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" successfully follows up the first chapter with tons of dizzying excitement, romance, and superhero fun. Although it feels a little overloaded at times, in the end it captures the essence of what comic book fans crave. It's a summer blockbuster with intentions of being taken seriously at the same time through elements of human drama and teen angst."
"rammstein2710","8","1","6","7 May 2014"," Worth watching for Jamie Foxx and mind blowing action scenes.
","It took a lot of efforts to make up my mind and see this movie, as i found the first part really boring and annoying. But this part will definitely score 10/10 for its action sequence. Seeing Electro and his power was refreshing for sure.<br/><br/>Mark webbed pulled out a rabbit from a hat. Never expected him to deliver such a high intensity action sequence, with electrifying background score. Kudos to Jamie Foxx, he made even thunder lightning looked like a mere spark in front of Electro. <br/><br/>Here comes the 'but' part, it looks like action hero movies has already exhausted their quota for dialogues. Dialogues appeared repetitive n forced. The chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen lacked spark and looked stretched, although Gwen's death did surprised and hurt at the same time. Harry's character deserved more screen time.Listening to Spiderman's teasers to villains brought back old memories."
"TheMovieVlog","7","1","6","6 May 2014"," Very good Spidey-Movie! Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man!
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a very fun film but also a very flawed one. On the one hand its a very fun action film with some great performances and great special effect. On the other hand the plot feels like it wants to be so many things that it felt jumbled and lacked focus. The villains were exciting and cool but also felt underwhelming in the ending result. Electro lacked resolution and Harry Osbourne just seemed pushed. Also, what was the point of Rhino? I understand they are trying to setup the Six storyline, but they need to keep the story in one place. Andrew Garfield is the best Spider-Man to ever grace the big screen, sorry Tobey Maguire. Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHann, and the rest are all fantastic as well. The action was beautifully done and Peter Parker's character had some very good development and his wise cracking humor made the film highly enjoyable. Overall while it doesn't tread any new ground we still receive a sequel that lives up to its fun predecessor and proves to be more than worth the price of admission."
"Alise_shenle","7","1","6","6 May 2014"," Let The Bromance Begin!!
","I was very reluctant to watch this movie because I was disappointed with the 1st movie. But since it was the only movie showing, I decided to watch it. I did not regret my choice. The pros: The villains were really good at their portrayal. Harry not only looked like an emo teenager who whispers and sport a goth haircut, he had a real reason to save his own skin. Max Dillon was very pitiful as a villain and he seems to reflect all the teenagers who want to be seen on social media. Max is like a stalker who had a crush on his hero Peter. But when Peter scorned him, Max turned to Harry, because Harry said he needed him, and all that mushy stuff. Gwen Stacy grew a backbone and became a perfect woman who is smart AND beautiful. The movie was also very action-packed and long. Cons: Am I the only one who thinks Gwen is a hypocrite? If she want to be successful so much, why did she lead Peter on when she''s going to England? She seems very indecisive about whether she want to be with Peter or not, and her death, is purely caused by her wilfulness. She is also dressed really unrealistically like for her interview, which made this movie less realistic. Peter also looked uglier than ever, and selfish as always, because he thinks he is doing what he thinks is best for Harry. Well, what can you expect from these ""non best friends"" who didn't talk for 8 years? Overall, if you try to ignore Peter and his whole self-righteousness thing, then focus on the handsome Harry and the pitiful Max, then you will enjoy the movie."
"marvelmanny","Null","1","6","6 May 2014"," The best Spider-Man film so far.
","I was talking to a friend of mine, and he said there really hasn't been a definitive, and really good Spider-Man film. And while the Spider-Man films are enjoyable- none seem to stand out over time. This one, however, does.<br/><br/>So why does it? What makes this film stand out, when all the others have attempted, but eventually failed in delivering a great Spider-Man film. I believe it is two things. The casting, and the writing.<br/><br/>I mean, I asked my brother the other day saying, ""Which couple in film has the best chemistry."" He thought for a moment, then replied saying, ""Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone."" And I believe him. It's like they're not acting in certain scenes. While many other film couples are very still and kind of dull in the way they act towards one another, these two are not. I guess it's because it's not forced. And that's what I really dug about the romance.<br/><br/>But my friend said that it showed too much of Gwen and Peter, and not enough of Spider-Man. I don't know. That's something you'd have to decide. On the other hand I understand why they did what they did because they wanted to build up the relationship as much as possible because this is Emma Stone's last go as Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>When The Rhino, or Paul Giamatti first spoke, my friend and I cracked up. It was amazingly hilarious. I found the accent to be ridiculously brilliant.<br/><br/>At first when they cast Jaimie Fox, I was upset. I was upset because the character in the comics is obviously white, but they made him black, most likely for political reasons. But he happened to do an amazing job! He played shy very well, and a man who has no friends well as well. I really felt for him when he became Electro, and he was upset at Spider-Man and all the people.<br/><br/>Sally Field added layers to Aunt May's character. She goes beyond just a simple doting grandmother like character from the original films, even though the original Aunt May was great.<br/><br/>And then there's finally Harry Osborn. I'll put it this way. The guy behind me in the theater said it perfectly. ""He's a way better Harry Osborn than James Franco."" <br/><br/>And then there's the writing. I believe the writing captured who Spider-Man is, and you saw that with the one liners, and how he put out Electro with the fireman's hat on. It had a great story, and they didn't throw in villains just for the sake of throwing in villains.<br/><br/>The only thing I would have changed is I wouldn't have killed Gwen Stacy, since you're not going to find a person that has better chemistry with Andrew Garfield. But that's just my take.<br/><br/>And that's all I have to say about that."

Newcomer Dane DeHaan was a great choice for Harry Osborn/Goblin. I was pumped when they announced him for the character, mainly because of Chronicle. I was surprised how much Dennis Leary was in this movie though, I thought he was great in the first movie. Jaime Foxx was another person who did a phenomenal job in this movie, his transformation from a bumbling nobody to a villain to be reckoned with was impressive. Finally Paul Giamatti is a very talented actor and I felt as if he was underused in this sequel. He had a heavy accent and had barely any screen time, but his scenes were some of the best in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts off in the past with Peter's parents and how why they had to leave him as a child. I was surprised how badass his parents were for a couple of revolutionary scientists. After his parents' demise, the film jumps right into Peter doing his thing around the city as everybody's favorite hero. As he jumps, flips, and swings through the city after some criminals, he showcases his cockyness. A lot of physical humor as he's using his superior reflexes and agility to save the day and narrowly making his high school graduation at the same time. Then this is where the movie slows down a little, Peter has to deal with the promise he made to Dennis Leary at the end of the last movie to stay away from his daughter, Gwen Stacy. This throws a lot of guilt on his shoulders because he is blatantly disregarding the promise he made. Gwen and Peter go back and forth with this ""we can't be together"" for a chunk of the movie. This is where Harry comes into play and Peter starts to uncover more about his parents actually reasons for leaving. The movie kind of drags until Max Dillon has the typical pre-villain accident that turns him into Electro. Spider-Man's first battle with Electro in Times Square is awesome. That action was entertaining and unique, the CGI in this movie was well done, especially the slow motion and 3-D. I love when movies nail the use of 3-D and this sequel did, just as the previous movie did. Then Harry takes over Oscorp and digs up all of the company's technology and projects, basically to give him everything he needs to become the goblin. I really enjoyed when Harry teamed up with Electro and wreaked havoc on the city. The movie culminates into a battle at the electric grid where Spider-Man takes out Electro then battles Green Goblin back to back. Peter goes toe to toe with Harry and Gwen gets caught in the mix. As she is falling to her peril Peter shoots his web down after her, only to maneuver through ridiculous odds to only reach her a split second too late. He catches her but she smacks the floor just enough to end her life. This takes its toll on Peter as he gives up his webs and tights for a normal life. Only for it to be five months later and the mysterious man in the shadows from the end of the first one, unleashes Rhino onto the city. The movie ends with the clip played in every trailer of him swinging the man hole cover at Rhino.<br/><br/>I would give this movie a 7/10 because it had a great cast and great action, but it just had a big lull in the middle that didn't really do it for me. Yeah I get it, Gwen's gonna die so let's make sure she gets her screen time before then to make it more meaningful, but I'd rather have seen Spider-Man handle business in the streets. On a side note, I am most definitely excited for the Sinister Six movie."

","Just got back from a matinée showing of ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"".<br/><br/>Actually feel like it is an improvement over the first TASM film in many regards. <br/><br/>First off: The 3D is spectacular. They use it to great effect with Spider-Man vaulting through the city. This is one of the few films that I think really should be seen in 3D. There was one scene where some glass fell towards the screen that actually made me flinch and blink!<br/><br/>Next up: Andrew Garfield is tremendous as Spider-man. As much as I liked Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker, Garfield's Spidey just never shuts his mouth and constantly has a wise-crack with 3 more ready to go... THIS is the Spider-man from the comics, and i love him for it.<br/><br/>I'm not the world's biggest Jaime Foxx fan, and i was kinda dreading what the trailers made his Electro look like, but i actually felt he was an effective villain with well-established motivations. <br/><br/>I also really enjoyed Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborne. Really looking forward to seeing the Osborne-Parker rivalry play out in future films. <br/><br/>This movie has a good heart, and some very real emotional punch. <br/><br/>I would list it as the best Spider-man film in the franchise.....2nd only to Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2""."
"niran-rockon","8","1","6","1 May 2014"," Great Work
","Brilliantly plotted and portrayed. The movie has everything what a complete movie should have (i.e Action, Lovestory, Suspense, etc). Moreover you got to appreciate the work done by the artists. The twist in the ending is the best part, which will give a good start to a spin-off ""Sinister-six"". Never expected that Gwen dies in the end, although i did expected to see Gwen in the next sequel. Remarkable CGI, the portray of Electro was a stroke of genius. The chemistry shared between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is sizzling. But on the other hand,i feel that the role played by Jamie fox is too short. They could have showed a bit more, which might make him look scarier."
"aledwilliamsmail","7","1","6","30 April 2014"," What Superhero Movies Need
","I went to the cinema with doubts about this movie. After seeing about 20 trailers I though I had seen most of the movie ( plus the clips we saw were, to be honest, not the best ) but boy, I was wrong. With great action scenes, engaging characters and an entertaining plot this has to be the best Spiderman movie Sony have made.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Peter's personal life throughout most of the movie as he tries to keep a normal life with Gwen and figure out what happened to his parents. The main villain is Electro which is brilliantly acted by Jamie Foxx but unfortunately doesn't get enough screen time. The second villain is the Green Goblin, acted by Dane DeHaan who was not ( in my opinion ) the best choice of casting because he seems depressed most of the time and makes the character rather boring. <br/><br/>This film feels like you are watching a comic book rather than a movie, as it isn't all fight scenes and sadness because we see Spiderman save people rather than focus on the villain and destroy everything possible. Talking about destruction, the visual effects look amazing but seem a bit like a cartoon which is rather good to keep the feeling of a comic book.<br/><br/>Overall this film is entertaining but doesn't live up to the name amazing. I would recommend anyone to watch it as it is something new and basically a new genre of movie, a comic book movie."
"aesgaard41","3","2","19","17 August 2015"," How Not To Make a Comic Book Movie -
","I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'm a bigger fan of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies than the Andrew Garfield version. My excuse is and has always been that Sam Raimi was such a fan of the Spider-Man movies that he knew how to do it right. On the other hand, the Andrew Garfield version was more about the Ultimate Universe version than the real Spider-Man, and there was the difference. There are elements in both movies that work very well, and elements in both movies that don't. Tobey's version was more like basic Spidey; Garfield's was more like the updated version. They were two different versions, and despite the fact Raimi did a better job, Emma Stone still kicks Kristen Dunst as far as sex appeal. On the other hand, Garfield's sense of vengeance over the murder of his uncle is a poor substitute for ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Amazing Spider-Man 2, however, seems to get worse than its original with even more plot lines to fall over and crash into each other. I couldn't keep up with everything that was going on, and quite frankly, there was nothing about them to make me interested. The villains are kind of lame and shallow. Electro terrorizes the city for no reason but to be noticed. The weird part is that when he gets arrested they terrorize him by electrocuting him. This makes as much sense as punishing an Ewok with a bath and flea dip. However, Paul Giamatti as the Rhino does nothing but yell and threaten kids. When he shows up in a giant ridiculous robot Rhino tank, it looks as if he's auditioning for the next ""Transformers"" movie. Harry Osborn's motivation makes a little sense, but as the Green Goblin, all he is an amped-up school bully on crack. At least Sandman, Doctor Octopus and Venom had clear goals that went far beyond just killing Spider-Man. I mean, in Spider-Man 3, the villain that had the least to do was Sandman, but at least, he had some really cool bank robbery scenes. Even Venom had a little worth doing as an alien-possessed psychopath. Another thing that annoys me about the movie is that it feels as if it runs just way too long with moments that feel like its ending but then it drags its way to yet scene that once again runs toward an ending before starting again. The only good parts of the movie I like are Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's chemistry. The web-slinging scenes are okay, but they're all but stolen from Sam Raimi's work. At times, the whole movie feels like two movies loosely interconnected with enjoyable scenes, such as the Peter-Gwen relationship broken up by the interims with what feels like the DC Universe version of Spider-Man. The movie is bothered immensely by the fact that it's trying to create all these lead-ins to an expanded Spider-Man Universe that unfortunately has no part in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (and thank God for that since Sam Raimi's version fits in a lot better with those films)."

","I went to the cinema with great anticipation and excitement after having seen the previous instalment of the ""newly yet again"" franchised series! The Movie started pretty dull, and continued at a very snail drone pace of boring dialogue and unnecessary scenes! I really liked how well the previous movie developed the protagonist character<br/><br/>but was duly unimpressed with the lack lustre character development of ""electro man,"" further more his sudden quick demise; why do so many sequels suck?<br/><br/>I think it's time that many of these movie producers take a back seat with too much cgi laden effects and get back to the good old story telling days, or better yet try to keep the consistency of successful movie making by keeping the same team on hand that bought about the last well scripted, and directed movie."
"Floated2","3","2","20","6 January 2015"," Underdeveloped Let Down of a Sequel
","The followup sequel to the 2012 reboot The Amazing Spider-Man, director Marc Webb returns to bring this sequel. Now having watched the film in its full entirety, I have noticed more than its share of pieces than I have originally. TASM2 is precisely nowhere near as complete and story oriented than its processor, and there are several reasons for these claims. In TASM2 the tension and characters between the leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are there, but there was too much of it. The romance worked in the first one but in here, it should have been toned down. The lead villain of Electro (Jamie Foxx) I believe was a terrible choice as a villain and actor. The presence was not felt, and Electro being the lead villain did not do justice. There was little excitement. I did enjoy Dane Dehaan as Harry Osbourne, the Green Goblin, but his character as the Green Goblin was underused (Green Goblin only shows up for one scene towards the final 30 minutes). The development was not much but the relationship scenes with Peter and Harry were solid.<br/><br/>The overall tone of the film was much more depressing than the original. Mainly because of how the film ends with letting Gwen have an exit (we knew it was coming but I believe it could have done much more smoothly). Aside from that, the overall atmosphere just did not work and it was more dark and less to get into. The story was lacking, which is why I think TASM was much better, because it had a better story, more original and there was more heartfelt emotion left. Also there were more consistent action scenes where as in TASM2 it did feel more as a love story, which of course would be a letdown for Spider-Man fans. As of now it is undecided how TASM3 will be, or if there will be another reboot of the franchise. I hope the best decision will be made. ==================================================================== == ======
As a rewatch (07/10/17') we can see the flaws and overall tone which made this film be considered a mess for critics and movie goers resulting into the eventual reboot for Spider-Man: Homecoming. The main problems with the film as mentioned in the review are the plot isn't as interesting as they thought and has been done before and the character of Max/Electro was a very weak and awful choice for a villain. The character did a very quick turn into loving Spider-Man to wanting to kill him. It made little sense.Besides the nice visuals, and the costume of Spider-Man, much of this film was a disappointment. In the end, TASM2 may be the most forgettable Spider-Man live action film. After a third rewatch 04/03/19', TASM2 really does not offer much of anything interesting, and there are many flaws. Not enough interest to warrant a great watch."
"jlbanchick-191-940386","2","2","20","21 December 2014"," Could have been done well... But wasn't
","Well I wanted to love this movie but the screenplay and general direction of the series has major issues.<br/><br/>1st. OK... In the first film in this franchise... spiderman had a serious vendetta to find the tattooed man who shot his Uncle. Which was dropped as soon as the Lizard storyline went into full swing ( pun intended). This storyline was not even hinted at in ASM2 !<br/><br/>2nd. Casting was very good for both spiderman and Gwen (love Emma Stone)! But the screenwriters should have carried the Gwen/goblin arch across the initial trilogy thereby giving the viewer the real emotional response to Gwen's death!<br/><br/>3rd. Peter and Harry's relationship. Totally ridiculous! Buddy's at 7 years old hadn't seen each other for 10 formative years, one son of multi millionaire and the other working class. They meet again and are best buds! Who rights this stuff? Doesn't make any sense!<br/><br/>4th. Villains... Harry as Goblin? Nope... Stick with Norman right from the start. Plenty of time to develop Harry... but nooo! Electro... Meh. Trying to hard to have it both ways and have a villain that you can sympathize with. Rhino? Love Paul Giomati but he obviously didn't take the role seriously and belonged more in Batman and Robin than this movie but there is that screenplay again. Not really his fault if that was how he was directed.<br/><br/>All in all a complete failure. It's amazing that after the screenplay was completed that it wasn't given to someone (even a fanboy) to look for these shortcomings! There is over fifty years of spiderman cannon to look back on. Come on people... Marvel has the material all set and ready to translate... You don't have to reright the book just mold it to todays audience! Give us the classic characters and plot lines with up to date mythology and everyone will be happy!"
"Travixius","3","2","20","20 December 2014"," Worst superhero film of the last 20 years...
","Wow, where do I begin? Talk about a complete disrespect for the source material. The character designs for the villains in this film were appalling. There were too many villains which has never worked before. Think the Schumacher Batmans and Raimi's Spiderman 3 (which was actually OK). The 3 points this movie gets is 1 for the death of Gwen (ballsy) 2 for Andrew Garfield (a decent piece of casting) and 3 for finally getting the costume exactly right. I cannot believe Stan Lee could possibly be happy with what they did in this film. The formulaic nature of the film was terrible and offered nothing fresh. Jaime Foxx was miscast and insipid. And what's with the Green Goblin looking like Billy Idol?? And don't get me started on the Rhino. Time for Sony to hand this character over to Paramount, recast the role and join the Avengers and leave this mess of a continuity behind forever."

"happy_hangman","4","1","7","15 March 2015"," Awkward Middle-Film in (Inevitable) Trilogy
","'Amazing Spider-Man 2' was less satisfying than its predecessor, as many of the action sequences looked and felt like RPG graphics. That said, Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was rather better fleshed-out than in the original movie. That she is the most engaging character in the film is unfortunate as - as any comic geek knows - as soon as she and Pete chat atop the George Washington Bridge, things will not be ending in hugs and puppies. Andrew Garfield is still mumbling too much, and Chris Cooper is wasted on such a small role, and his grimmacing heir is too clearly a nut from his first appearance to be anything other than a caricature. The Parker family back-story is nicely expanded (in expectation of a big reveal in Part 3, I'm betting), but everything else seems rushed."
"MattBrady099","3","1","7","10 October 2014"," Enjoyable film.
","We've always known that Spider-Man's most important battle has been within himself: the struggle between the ordinary obligations of Peter Parker and the extraordinary responsibilities of Spider-Man. But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). <br/><br/>This movie is not as good as the first because most of the villains are just there just to push the plot along. The visual effect's in the movie are okay and the green goblin was just wasted in the movie and that was just a shame. The movie wants you to feel for Jamie Foxx character Electro but the movie fails at trying to make us feel for this guy, why can't there have a scene like in the Lego movie when are main hero has to talk to the villain with one of beautiful and the most touching scene is when he tells the villain that he is amazing person and he can do amazing things without being evil. It may not be as good as the first but it's still enjoyable to watch."
"MikeM1984","7","1","7","15 May 2014"," Underrated but probably would've worked better as a first movie with less characters
","I gave it a 7, simply because I felt like a 6 was too low, although it may warrant such a rating.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying I felt like the movie parts were better than the sum of those parts. The movie was very overly ambitious, although it did well to hit many important Spider-Man beats while missing many others. The most noteworthy misfire is how callously the movie casts aside Uncle Ben in favor of Peter's father and Captain Stacey who frankly are not as central. The first movie really shot itself in the foot by diminishing their relationship severely. This is supposed to be the man Peter admired and loved the most. In the comics his father is gone before Peter has made many memories of them. This movie series he has more vivid memories. But even here I found myself siding with Aunt May that essentially these were just people who abandoned him; that she and Ben were his true parents. As it should have been.<br/><br/>However overall this movie trumps the last one, and demonstrates some understanding of Spider-Man that felt very absent in the Raimi movies. Namely the quips, his confidence while being Spider-Man versus his awkwardness as Peter, his connection to the 'common folk' of New York (although Raimi touched on this as well), making all his villains kooky science experiments, making Electro and Rhino basically overpowered henchmen as they usually are in the comics. All that stuff was great. The fight scenes were also spectacular.<br/><br/>There's a lot in these movies that reminds me of early 80s Spider-Man, and a fair bit that reminds me of the initial Lee/Kirby runs mixed in with some of the Ultimate Spider-Man. It does a good job of ""feeling like"" a comic without coming off completely campy. This tone strikes a balance I haven't even seen in great movies like TDK and X2.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is the plot, or complete lack of one. That too, almost adds to the comic feel. The movie to me felt like a series of one shot issues, rather than one complete story. It felt almost like a musical, but instead of breaking into song, they broke into Spider-Man versus villain fights. But it seems like they don't know precisely where to take anyone. No one develops, no one has a Catharsis. They all just show up, overact a line or two, then move on.<br/><br/>The movie, as I would describe it, is very raw. It's almost like Webb understands Spider-Man very well, but struggles to find what story to tell, but he knew he had to hurry up and SPOILER ALERT kill that one person we know HAS to be killed. I loved the way he handled the death. It was perfect. But that, itself could've been a movie. Electro could've been a movie. Rhino, could've gotten more to do. It's a mess.<br/><br/>But it is a fun mess. I was entertained, so I won't be too hard on them."
"phadvijayanand","8","1","7","12 May 2014"," This time he is Amazing ...
","Last movie was blunder for someone like me who is a big fan of Spiderman. I understand because of some business reasons Sony released the first one.<br/><br/>This time it look like a better worked film. It's on a big canvas as you expect this super hero to be. Everything looks so big.<br/><br/>The plot is a known story. Electrode. Another super villain made of electric eel ! 3D is amazing and watching yourself to go jump and swing like a Spiderman is just great. Story makes you stick to your sits for most of the movie. Action scenes are just great, thanks to the skills of director. Love story between Spiderman and Gwenn is romantic and a plus point. The background score is another plus point of this movie.<br/><br/>Though there are some negative points to the movie as well. Electro role is bit confusing, you don't sympathize him neither you hate him. Sometimes, rarely, story may get just stretched a little bit.<br/><br/>Everything else is a good watchable experience."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","7","5 May 2014"," Webb has done it again
","This really is a golden age for fans of super-heroes movies like me with Batman, Superman, Iron Man, X-Men and more hitting the screens month after month with big budgets and even bigger takings. When a character seems to run out of steam, one just has to leave him alone for a few years and then re-boot the hero. So, after three ""Spider-Man"" movies from director Sam Raimi, Marc Webb had such a success with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" that he's back with another winner.<br/><br/>I actually prefer Andrew Garfield to Tobey Maguire as the titular arachnid and this outing he's somewhat schizophrenic in mood: astonishingly light-hearted in the face of any villain but really morbid when it comes to family history and current romance. There is genuine chemistry between Garfield and co-star Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy) which is obviously helped by their real-life coupling.<br/><br/>The chief protagonist this time is a sparky character called Electro who had an unfortunate swimming accident with some eels and James Foxx clearly had fun in a different type of role for him. The subsidiary opponent is the Green Gobin whose starring role is obviously being kept back for the next movie in the series, ensuring that we will see the creepy Dabe HeHaan again. I enjoyed the more varied use of our hero's web in this movie for a lot more than swinging from one skyscraper to another. Stan Lee has met Tim Berners-Lee, so that the web has now become world wide.<br/><br/>There are three writing credits for this film which might explain why some characters are underwritten. Certainly I would like to have seen more of the excellent Paul Giamatti as The Rhino and newcomer Felicity Jones as Harry Osborn's assistant. So take that as a request for ""TASM3""."
"jamieradford","8","1","7","5 May 2014"," The Amazing Spiderman 2:
","Rebooting the Spiderman franchise so soon after the very successful Sam Raimi trilogy was never going to be an easy task for Director Marc Webb. The three films, featuring Toby Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman are the fifth, sixth and seventh highest grossing superhero movies ever – a testament to their popularity.<br/><br/>While Webb did introduce a few new elements into the story, including a more confident Peter Parker played by Andrew Garfield, and a continuing subplot concerning Peter's parents, it did not reach the heights of its predecessors.<br/><br/>That may also turn out to be the case with The Amazing Spiderman 2: Rise of Electro. If so it will be through no fault of those involved in the film, for they have done – if you'll pardon the pun – an amazing job.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Garfield and Stone was one of the positives to come out of the first film, and that has continued, and even improved in the second. So too has the performance of Garfield. His honest portrayal of Peter Parker, of the highs and lows he goes through as a teenage superhero, have you investing in the character as the movie progresses. <br/><br/>He takes the time to talk to those he has rescued, even while chasing a truck through the city, and when he catches up with the criminals is never short of a wise crack. <br/><br/>Despite this sometimes teenage brashness, Peter Parker is a nice kid, and warming to Garfield was not difficult.A scene in which he protects a young boy from bullies is a fine example of this. His conversation with the boy could easily have been condescending, instead it was as I said – honest.<br/><br/>There are better villains, and more of them. Jamie Foxx is a bit over the top as Electro, but as the whole concept of an electrified glow in the dark villain is too, that can certainly be forgiven. Dane Dehann is suitably creepy as Harry Osborne, and later the Green Goblin, while the always delightful Paul Giamatti makes a short, but memorable appearance as the Rhino at the end of the film. Both should be back for the third installment.<br/><br/>The special effects, as expected are excellent, and not particularly overused considering the genre. The story is cohesive and interesting, giving the cast something to work with, and they all do their jobs well. Too often, a decent story is neglected due to the overuse of CGI. That certainly isn't the case here. In fact the two Marc Webb films are two of the few I would actually recommend seeing in 3D, particularly when Spidey is swinging through New York.<br/><br/>While Marc Webb's first foray into the Marvel universe was not as successful at the box office as both he and Marvel would have liked, I am certain this one will do a lot better. It certainly deserves to."

The first one wasn't as intense as this one though. The only reason that I like the villains in this one better was because they really had an impact on Spiderman. The Lizard had a dramatic back story to where you feel bad about his character, but so did Electro, who actually turned out to be a cooler villain than I thought he would be.

"moviexclusive","8","1","7","3 May 2014"," The romance is winning, the action thrilling, and the emotional beats moving – in other words, it's a sequel you can safely say is amazing
","Despite the inevitable comparison with Sam Raimi's marvellous 'Spider-man 2', Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is an excellent follow-up to its 2012 predecessor in almost every regard, combining a heartfelt teen romance with thrilling superhero action for a truly vertiginous spin in and around familiar landmarks of New York City.<br/><br/>Last we left Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, our favourite couple's relationship was strained by Peter's promise to her late father (Denis Leary) to leave her alone for safety's sake – and despite the obvious giddy chemistry between them, Peter finds himself haunted by visions of her father. Yet there is no shortage of tender intimate moments in their on/off relationship, and let's just say while some of their exchanges will leave you grinning and others will leave you tearing, there is just no denying that their romance is very much the emotional backbone of the whole movie, culminating in a shocking twist at the end which we suspect will leave few viewers dry-eyed.<br/><br/>The other part of the movie's emotional core lies with the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz seen in expanded flashback roles), tied to the shady corporation Oscorp run by Norman Osborn (Chris Cooper) which was also responsible for Curt Connors' mutating Lizard seen in the last film. While his Aunt May (Sally Field) has tried to keep the truth from him, Peter can't quite find closure without knowing why - and the return of his childhood pal Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) to take over the Oscorp business reignites his curiosity how his parents' fates were related to some top-secret experiment that his father Robert was working on with Norman before the former's death.<br/><br/>Oh and did we mention that Gwen also happens to be an employee of Oscorp while awaiting her entry into Oxford? That reeks smack of narrative convenience, but it does engender one of the most delightful meet-cute moments between Peter and Gwen that takes place in a broom cabinet in the Oscorp building no less. The necessity of weaving together the multiple story lines has Gwen digging into a former Oscorp engineer named Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), who is transformed after a lab accident involving a loose fuse and a tank of eels into the electrically charged villain Electro.<br/><br/>Of the numerous characters which inhabit the movie, Electro probably stands as the most redundant. There is something fascinating about the lowly and unappreciated Max at first, an individual so resigned to his own insignificance that he becomes obsessed with Spider-Man after a chance encounter on the street. Nonetheless, his psychosis – as well as his defining characteristic – fades into convention upon his transformation, while a surfeit of CGI take over to emphasise the extent of his destructive powers amidst an electrically-powered urban backdrop.<br/><br/>The more fascinating villain here turns out also to be the more familiar one, as Harry's frustration with his inborn frailties lead him on a path of rising animus with Spider-man and by extension Peter. While Harry's character arc is not much different from that in Raimi's version, DeHaan's chilling turn as the increasingly deranged Oscorp heir is far superior than what James Franco ever brought to the role. If you don't yet know him from 'Chronicle' or the Beat-era drama 'Kill Your Darlings', this is as notable an introduction as any, an initially sympathetic figure whose tragic circumstance leads him to become cynical and sinister within the same breath.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding their respective motivations, Webb exploits both his villains for some hugely entertaining action showdowns. Electro's descent upon Times Square midway through the film marks one of the definite highlights. No less impressive is Electro's climactic battle set amidst New York's key power grid, that makes thorough use of the numerous electric stacks for some mesmerising luminous shots from cinematographer Dan Mindel and a pulsing sub-dubstep score by Hans Zimmer and the bespoke collective known as The Magnificent Six for an electrifyingly gripping finish.<br/><br/>But Webb saves his most distinctive sequence for the last, with Spider- man confronted with the rise of the Green Goblin who knows his identity as Peter and therefore also his soft spot for Gwen. Symbolically set within a clock tower whose gears and ticking hands take on a whole new meaning by the time the dust settles, it reps one of the most tough- minded but simultaneously poignant endings in a superhero movie that we have seen, thrusting our titular character in an entirely new – and ultimately very exciting – direction. Webb's forte as a director was always in his ability to forge affecting relationships between his characters, and the emotional payoff he delivers here is truly something to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Certainly he has his actors to thank for that. British actor Andrew Garfield continues to grow ever more comfortable in the role of Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. He starts off goofy, cocky even, but ever more conscious of how he might be power-ful in saving the citizens of New York but power-less in protecting the ones close to him. There is little more we need to say about the spark that Garfield shares with his real-life girlfriend Emma Stone, except that they make an irresistibly winning couple. Foxx is better portraying his character's tortured psyche as Electro than as Max, but Giamatti absolutely chews up the scenery in the few scenes he has playing the Rhino.<br/><br/>Arguably, neither prove as compelling as they should be, with DeHaan's Green Goblin the only interesting villain that the movie has going for it. But what it lacks in malevolence, this crowd-pleasing sequel makes up for in teenage sass, unexpected poignancy and oh yes good old- fashioned Hollywood spectacle. It may not top Raimi's benchmark, but it is mammoth summer popcorn entertainment of the highest calibre, finally living up to the addition of the adjective 'amazing' to this trilogy's title."

"dearbornvendetta","8","1","7","1 May 2014"," A welcome step up from the first
","Well I've been looking forward to this one since the credits rolled on the first one. This series excited me from the moment the reboot was announced because I felt like I might get more the the comic book feel Spider-Man. And the first one The Amazing Spider-man delivered that but was hindered by small problems mostly due to trying to retell a familiar story in a fresh approach. I knew the sequel would probably be better and Im happy to report that it is in almost every way. <br/><br/>First the 3D is better than ever let me just get that out. The romance this time around felt way more believable and kept me interested. Unlike the soap opera feel that Toby and Kirstin had this romance feels fun and interesting. People have been complaining the movies tries to juggle too many villains. I can say for sure that this is Electro's show and Green Goblin has a minimal role as well as Rhino. Jamie Fox as Electro is a genuine creep. The kind of guy you want to know about when he moves into your neighborhood. He is such a lonely man that it has twisted him into a man who is too weird not to be alone. The fight scenes between him and Spider-Man are truly awesome to behold. Andrew Garfield is having more fun here and he has fully settled into his tights. His Spider-Man continues to be more fun than Toby's spider- man. I felt Spider-man seemed even more appreciated in the movie than any of the other films and that combined with Hans Zimmer's new score make for a movie that is hard not to sit there smiling.<br/><br/>There is more heart to this sequel. For a movie boasting bigger action and special effects and villains I found this to be up there next to Spider-Man 2 for having a heartfelt story. Although I still rate Spider-Man 2 as my favorite in all the Spider-Man movies this is my second favorite. It almost feels unfair to compare the 2 series as they are both trying something different. This sequel is defiantly the most fun I've had watching a Spider-Man movie. At the end of the day comic book junkies will complain and critics will complain about the comic book qualities but if you just want to have fun and see a great Spider- Man film this wont disappoint. Don't walk in expecting an Oscar movie and you wont walk out disappointed. If you do then its your fault for not liking it and who cares about your ranting wont change anything. When the credits rolled I was upset knowing I had to wait 2 more years to see the next. 8 out of 10 for me. Thanks for reading."

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Is a fantastic sequel(Surprisingly) .<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is excellent. He practically lives the character. His One Liners are hilarious. Emma Stone is beautiful.

His scenes with Garfield are pretty solid. This guy has a great future. The Action Sequences are very good. This is one of the movies I would recommend people watching in 3D.

Overall, its a good movie to watch. I have no reason to say this movie as a poor movie. This movie start with a funny scene when Spidey catch up the criminal in the New York city and it's really entertaining. Forget about the comics and enjoy the movie. This is new generation or Spidey! Just like Iron Man, another Marvels movie, this new version of Spider Man has a good joke to make people laugh and I think it's not a problem.<br/><br/>I thought it was an enjoyable superhero movie that is the best of its genre besides Iron Man and Avengers."

","The movie basically was a bit confusing initially...later on you get to see literally too much action.You kinda feel like why Jamie Foxx thinks that he had been told the lie.There was a breakup between spidy and gwen. The relation between the two main characters looked complicated.It had a good amount of comedy, truly deep emotions, and brilliant action.The movie has so much of that Spidey's humor which we all adore!There are two bad guys in this film, Electro and the Green Goblin.I was really surprised that spidey used to kill anybody,apparently he did in this movie.It was a bit underwhelming in the middle.Peter promised/said he'd take care of her and she refused to stay and more or less said she would take care of herself and would be alright by his side. It wasn't that way, as sadly, she died.There was lack of dialogue and disappointing ending.It was like the film ends just as they are starting to battle!Marvel focused on the length of the movie too.Overall Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did a pretty god job.I give a 7.5/10"
"ghassemismith7","7","1","7","23 April 2014"," Quick review on quality of film
","This film is a classic action film, more or less like any other, filled with explosions, crashes, and hand to hand combat between generally handsome actors. However....that doesn't prevent it from having it's own specific charm. Spiderman is just another superhero, but he's got his own charms. This film was highly entertaining at times comic, and just a pleasure to watch. It's not high end cinema, but then again that's not what it was destined to be. This is a great film to just watch and have a good time! It's fun, action packed, comic and full of a man in a tight jumpsuit flying between buildings ( but you knew that already!) It's entertaining and I recommend to go and see it."
"orionschwert","8","1","9","8 May 2014"," Well done !
","I give it a rock solid 8 out of 10. <br/><br/>The action : was nicely paced and decent to watch. End-fight cutting was a bit lightweight and disorientating but maybe the good man had no other choice because of the raw material or the wishes of director/producers...?...who knows. Did not ruined the film.<br/><br/>The story : absolutely fine nice plots, dialogs, characters etc. That was all the time easy and interesting to follow up.<br/><br/>The acting : How the two little love-birds interacted was simply beautiful and refreshing. A gem ! I swear that I found out only after watching the movie that they are in real a couple as well !! So cute all that. Here and there I found Garfield not funny when trying to be funny...but hey, that was only in 2 or 3 scenes when chasing the villains. Speaking of....Jamie Foxx was a nice choice as well. <br/><br/>Music, settings, costumes, sounds, sfx.... all flawless. I was happy to learn that Hans Zimmer can still surprise me. I knew that he can annoy me but here I have nothing but compliments for the score. <br/><br/>-------------- Under the line : Part two felt a bit more sound than the 1st part and I'm still under the impression that I had an enjoyable time in cinema and that the money was well spent. This movie offers emotion, action, fantasy, sci-fi and what remains most is that cute love story with Emma and Andrew. I could not ask much more from a Spidey-movie. Well done!"
"zardoz-13","8","1","10","12 May 2014"," Better Than Its Predecessor But Too L-o-n-g!!!
","Although it surpasses its predecessor, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" suffers from too many villains. Meantime, audiences should prepare themselves for more narrative tweaking on the part of ""(500) Days of Summer"" director Marc Webb, ""Star Trek"" writers Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci, and ""Fringe"" scribe Jeff Pinkner to the classic Marvel Comics characters created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko back in August 1962. Initially, ""Evil Dead"" director Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy coupled Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker with Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson, while the Andrew Garfield reboot pairs Peter with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy. Technically, in the comics, Gwen was Peter Parker's first love. Clearly, Webb's reboot shows more fidelity to the comics than the original Raimi trilogy. Peter and Gwen were dating before our hero met Mary Jane. Comparably, Superman has two comic book love interests: Lois Lane and Lana Lang. Mind you, Lois has dominated the movies. This time around the tweaking involves a villain that Tobey Maguire tangled with in his first web-crawling chronicle. Of course, people don't watch ""Spider-man"" movies, or any superhero saga, to agonize over the fate of the invincible entity. We show up for the latest outlandish villain, their origin story, the inevitable showdown with Spider-Man, and pyrotechnical constellation of special effects. <br/><br/>Imitating the Warner Brothers' Batman franchise, Webb and company pit Spidey against three villains to keep him busy throughout this occasionally tedious two hour and twenty minute plus pandemonium. Judged by this criterion, ""Amazing Spider-Man 2"" trumps its one-adversary predecessor with a triple threat treat. Happily, Jamie Fox's glowering Electro, Dane DeHaan's bizarre Green Goblin, and Paul Giamatti's obstreperous Rhino are far livelier than Rhys Ifans' dreary Lizard. Electro puts up the fiercest fight. Green Goblin doesn't match Electro in terms of actual combat, but he contributes to the worst thing that happens in the third act. Indeed, the allure then is not just for the adversaries but also for the hero's closest friends. Apart from Sally Fields' indestructible Aunt May, Gwen Stacy is the only other hold-over from the 2012 original. Webb and his writers add a wrinkle that raises the romance above its usual peripheral subplot status. Everything that Spider-Man does has consequences for Gwen. Naturally, a superhero spends his life negotiating an obstacle course, and the love interest complicates matters. Spider-Man worries about Gwen not so much because he loves her. We're reminded Spider-Man swore an oath to her gruff father, the late Captain Stacy, that he would stay out of her life. Every time he turns around, Spider-Man sees the specter of Captain Stacy frowning at him and this haunts him. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" opens about the same time as its predecessor, with a juvenile Peter in his parents' house. All we know from the original is that Richard Parker (Campbell Scott of ""Dying Young"") and his wife deposited Peter at the house of his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. In the sequel, we see what else happened after they left Peter and boarded a private jet to Switzerland. This scene reminded me of the opening scene aboard a plane in the James Bond movie ""Moonraker."" Anyway, as far as we know, the Parkers perished in a plane crash, but anything—you know—can happen in a cinematic superhero franchise. The action resumes with Spider-Man arriving in the nick of time to pick up his diploma at his high school graduation after thwarting a fanatical Russian criminal, Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti of ""Rock of Ages""), from stealing plutonium vials during a runaway chase through Times Square. This exhilarating demolition derby with Aleksei careening through downtown Manhatten traffic in a tow-truck hauling an armored car gets everything on off on the right foot. During this mayhem, Spider-Man saves Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx of ""Django Unchained"") from being struck by Sytsevich. Afterward, we are introduced to one of Peter's closest friends, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan of ""Lawless""), who haven't seen Peter for a decade. Comparatively, DeHaan doesn't eclipse James Franco from the Maguire trilogy. Oscorp executive Donald Menken (Colm Feore of ""Pearl Harbor"") ushers Harry to the bed of his dying father, Norman (Chris Cooper of ""Money Train""), who bears bad tidings to his son. Meantime, Max plunges accidentally into a tank at Oscorp and is bitten by genetically adapted electric eels. Eventually, Max mutates into the electrifying villain Electro who generates no end of problems for Spider-Man as well as the city electric company.<br/><br/>Once again, Garfield outshines Maguire as the costume-clad champion, even though it is obvious that Garfield, an Englishman in his thirties, doesn't look like an angst-afflicted teen. The twentysomething Stone is as luminous as ever as Gwen, but she is too old to be playing a teen, too. Nevertheless, this sympathetic couple shares enough chemistry and radiates enough charisma that it is easy for us to overlook their age disparity. Meanwhile, you'll have to suspend your disbelief because the larger-than-life antics could never occur in the real world. Indeed, Electro qualifies as an unusual villain, driven by revenge, who can materialize seemingly at will whenever and wherever he wants like a wraith. The showdown in Times Square with Spider-Man where Electro tries to electrocute everybody crackles with thrills and chills. Battling Electro alone would have been more than sufficient for ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but Webb and his writers unleash the nefarious Green Goblin while Gwen insists on helping Spider-Man despite the consequences. You could probably shove your finger into a light socket and experience the same effect that this noisy, ambitious, vertigo-inducing, sci-fi fantasy delivers with gusto. The OMG prosthetic make-up and visual effects are nothing short of stunning. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" doesn't know when to quit, and it leaves us breathless after a supreme tragedy to soldier on with our webslinger hero poised to battle one more adversary."

","Two versions: Andrew Garfield is the second actor to don muscle enhancing spandex in the current Spiderman franchise and his tenure is rumoured to be capped at two outings. Half way through this 140 minute marathon Peter Parker has spent most of his time stalking Gwen. Finally they attain lip lock in an Oscorp service closet. To my way of thinking there is nothing wrong with either actor who has played Spidey a good script wouldn't have fixed. Sally Field as the Weepy Widow is rather insufferable. That this superhero goes home to mummy/auntie to get his dirty underwear washed is rather laughable and sad.<br/><br/>This flick takes ages to get anywhere and the audience may die of boredom waiting for it to do it. Definitely not for the vertigo challenged. There is cartoonish violence and people do die here. One may believe the gangly Garfield as a spider but spider venom gives that little twerp unbelievable strength. One is given too much time to ponder these conundrums.<br/><br/>Some movies seem way too long. Had I paid $15 to watch The Amazing Spiderman Two live I'd have probably toughed it out, otherwise I'd have walked out after 15 minutes. Takes way to long for anything to happen in this 140-minute marathon. Radio-active blood or not this gangling spider has only 4 limbs and only enough brains to control one of them. Someone should stomp on him and put him out of his misery. Too much angst and not enough action here. Spidey spends nearly an hour stalking Gwen as only a spider could from vertigo-inducing heights. The movie can't decide if it's an unrequited love story, a tragedy, or an action movie. The final action sequence is truncated lest the audience die of boredom."

"sethmlanders","2","1","16","15 May 2014"," Disappointment (Spoiler-Free)
","*DEEP BREATH* Here we go: <br/><br/>I just saw this in theaters and holy cow was it bad! ""How bad was it?"". To be fair, I've seen Spider-Man 1, 2, 3 and the first Amazing Spider Man. So far, they were all great (except 3). I had very high expectations for this to be decent enough. What can possibly go wrong? As soon as the lights went down in the movie theater, I was excited.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes were catchy. It's getting interesting with back-story and appealing visuals. All of sudden, it goes downhill. First thing's first, the actor who played Harry was completely wrong and miscasted as this character. This Dane DeHaan guy makes James Franco's portrayal of the same role look like Al Pachino! Next, it started getting really slow after the 30 minute mark and it felt like an eternity until the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>It's pretty clear that Jamie Foxx (who is a talented actor) couldn't refuse the paycheck. Also, that Rhino dude was unintentionally hilarious to the point where the film literally took itself way too seriously. Now I know that Andrew Garfield is a fantastic actor but sometimes, the confusing writing forces him to do things that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example, Peter stalks Gwen to her appointment for admissions to this college she got accepted into. He then fraudulently poses as a college staff member to the woman at front desk and it isn't even clever/believable. Here's another issue I had with this over-hyped superhero flick. Peter dresses up as Spider-Man at Harry's request. Out of nowhere, Harry tells him that he's dying (I'm guessing that the cause of it is alcohol poisoning) and asks for his blood. ""Spider-Man"" makes up excuses, leaves, and sends Harry in a drunken rage making it a pointless filler scene for Harry to be shown as a a villain for less than 20 minutes of screen time. Overall, the special effects were impressive but the script was obviously rushed and it was surprisingly boring. Even in 3D, this was a flop!"
"mitch_zeldafan117","3","1","17","11 January 2015"," Worst Spider-Man Movie
","Where to begin hasn't Sony learned anything from Spider-Man 3 with too many villains? Obviously not and that's one of the reason's why this film failed. I have no problem with Electro but in my opinion he's not a good villain to be on the big screen. I hated all the villains in this film mostly Green Goblin, he looks NOTHING like The Goblin at all, is he green? No not really he looks like a me th head with bad teeth. The plot was all over the place and hardly made any sense. Oh Electro hates Spider-Man because he can't see that it's Max Dillion how can you tell who that is when he's BLUE and wears a HOODIE? It would have been better if they went with the Spider Slayer's plot instead maybe or use Mysterio...but no it's too late Sony ruined it,I honestly hope they reboot it again and do it right this time. And maybe next time they won't include dub step in the movie and make Peter's jokes less stupid, I hated his excuses and his jokes they were just awful, I was washing the American flag, I was cleaning the chimney what the hell kind of excuses are those? The excuses and jokes in the Raimi films were way better."
"Eightiesjunkie","1","1","24","22 June 2015"," Sony, did you learn ANYTHING from Spider-Man 3?!
","Obviously not, because that's the impression I get from watching this cinematic abortion! Like I said before, I really don't think anyone cared about these movies. At least that's the way it seems to me. I'm really trying to understand the motive behind these reboot films, I've racked my brain trying to somewhat comprehend the reasoning as to why Sony decided to reboot the Spider-Man franchise. Keep in mind, that the Sam Raimi films brought in a lot of money for Sony studios, and while Spider-Man 3 was indeed panned by critics and fans alike, it was by no means a financial flop. Worldwide, it brought in a whopping Nine-hundred million dollars! In fact, both Sam Raimi and Sony studios were all-set to make a Spider-Man 4. However, Sony insisted that Spider-Man 4 would be done by the summer of 2011. Sam Raimi did not want to rush into making the film, and make the same mistake as Spider-Man 3. (Which wasn't his fault by the way!) So Sony scrapped Spider-Man 4, and began making the reboot film(s). That's one reason why, but it's not the only reason. Sony obviously saw the massive success and profits that Disney/Marvel studios was raking in with their Marvel cinematic universe, and decided to try the same thing with Spider-Man. I think everyone knows, that duplicating someone ELSE'S success, won't make YOU successful. The plot of this film, or should I say what little plot there is, isn't very good either. The films just jumps around from one thing to the next, and loses all focus on the story. The villains of the film lack charisma, and their motivations are paper thin. To sum it all up, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" Don't feel like comic book movies. (at least not to me.) They feel like romance movies. I don't know about anyone else, but when I go see a movie with the name ""Spider-Man"" that's the last thing I want."

Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro.

","Following the release of the first Amazing Spiderman film in the summer of 2012, it was no surprise that Sony Pictures, producer Avi Arad and director Marc Webb began working on a sequel and given the strong box-office numbers the film pulled in, it showed that the webhead could stand on his own as a film property, independent from the greater Marvel universe. With this temporary success in mind, Sony made it evident that they had no plans to let Spiderman join the MCU thus while The Amazing Spiderman 2 was being made, Sony revealed release dates for two sequels with the intention supposedly being to move forward with a direct storyline akin to what Sam Raimi did with his Spiderman films. However, the plan changed yet again when Sony decided that the shared universe format that had worked so well for The Avengers would be applied to Spiderman and that The Amazing Spiderman 2 and its two sequels would be used as a starting point for various spin-offs. Thanks to the sudden shift from a contained story to a shared universe, director Marc Webb had his job cut out from him as The Amazing Spiderman 2 had a lot more to live to by the studio executives at Sony. Webb however, wanted to focus more on the plot point of Peter's parents but Sony wasn't playing ball here as they continuously twisted the script to tease more sequels and spin-offs which came at the cost of developing the story and its characters. Even Sony's CEO, Kaz Hirai supposedly had a hand in editing the film despite not having any experience in the field. The film was subject to a fair amount of behind-the scenes-middling from Sony and when the film opened on May 2nd, 2014, it was met with severely mixed reviews from both critics and audiences and was the lowest-grossing film out of the entire Spiderman filmography up to that point.<br/><br/>Now, much like the first Amazing Spiderman film, my experience with The Amazing Spiderman 2 when it first came out is limited as comic book movies weren't my thing at the time so I never saw it in theaters. However, in early 2017 in preparation for seeing Spiderman: Homecoming, I decided to finally give the film a watch and much like the first film, there were elements that I enjoyed such as the acting and the musical score but many other aspects of the movie such as the story and characters left a lot to be desired in my eyes.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Oscorp scientist, Richard Parker recording a message explaining his reasons for going into hiding. Later on, Richard and his wife, Mary are flying on a private jet when the two of them are attacked by an assassin and die in the ensuing plane crash. Years later, Richard's son, Peter Parker now fights crime in New York City as the hero Spiderman. After chasing a truck full of plutonium and apprehending the driver, Peter is able to make it just in time for his high-school graduation. While there, Peter breaks up with girlfriend, Gwen Stacy. Peter's childhood friend, Harry Osborne returns to New York to visit his dying father, Norman and upon his passing, Harry is named the new CEO of Oscorp. While working late one night, Oscorp employee, Max Dillon accidentally shocks himself and falls into a tank of electric eels and he becomes a supervillain. Now, with this new threat to face, Peter Parker now must don the mask to protect those he loves as more secrets about his own past resurface while more enemies begin to tear at Peter's world as it starts to crumble.<br/><br/>
What is so unremarkable about The Amazing Spiderman 2 is how much it tries to feel like a comic book even if it isn't even close to having that kind of feel. Not that it's based on any of the Spiderman comic books themselves, even though there are numerous call-backs to memorable moments in the Spiderman mythos, even right down to the suit being pulled straight out of the comic pages rather than looking like a basketball like it did in the first Amazing Spiderman film. It isn't that Marc Webb is attempting to recreate the look and feel of a comic book as this isn't Ang Lee's Hulk or Into The Spiderverse, but instead, it again feels like Avi Arad and Sony bulling Webb at every turn to the point that Webb simply doesn't feel comfortable here as The Amazing Spiderman 2 feels more like a movie made by a committee rather than a movie with a story and characters the audience can be invested in and root for.<br/><br/>Take all the blatant problems that the first Amazing Spiderman film had such as the plethora of set-up and subplots that go absolutely nowhere, the cringe-inducing plot advancements, the moronic subplot of Peter learning about his parents' past that does nothing for the story at hand and absolutely head-scratching details like how a high-school student is given access to classified corporate files or knowing how to restart a power plant and turns it all up to 11. Add to that, numerous plot points that are never brought up again, an overstuffed story with too many plot threads, an incompetent script, Sony breathing down Marc Webb's neck at every waking moment and a movie spending more time on starting a shared universe rather than focusing on the story that it should be telling and you're left with one fundamentally flawed film. Sure the film tries to tell its own story, but thanks to Sony micro-managing it to hell and back and a lackluster script curiosity of Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Kevin Pinkner, the story here just feel weighed down by too much focus on making the film something that it shouldn't be.<br/><br/>At one point in the play, The History Boys, one of the characters says that history is just one thing after another. One can only envisage that Kurtzman, Orci, Pinkner and the editors of The Amazing Spiderman 2 might have that saying framed and on their desks, because it would seem that is their method of building a story is just to throw in one thing after another with no rhythm or reason to it. One could make the point that the scenes themselves are decently put together, but the various sub-plots and the various tones never really come together in a harmonious way but rather feel like they're fighting each other for attention and just clash continuously with nothing ever adding up with what the story wants to tell. Ultimately, it's fruitless in the end because when you get down to the core, The Amazing Spiderman 2 isn't really about anything. When it comes to the world of superhero movies, I adore ones that have great characters and that are able to tell a compelling story as well as provide an escape from real life, something that almost all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films have been able to do and this is true with many other superhero films. However, with The Amazing Spiderman 2, that is clearly not the case as the movie is more focused on setting up future films in Sony's shared Spiderman universe, only on occasion delivering on some kind of theme, but never consistently enough that it can fill the bare space at the film's heart. Once again, the beat of the film is so chopped up and broken that maybe there was a more consistent version of the film that was left on the cutting room floor, but I'm quite sure that much like Josh Trank's supposed original of Fant4sic, we'll probably never see that cut of The Amazing Spiderman 2 thanks to incompetent editing and Sony's typical meddling.<br/><br/>There's something that can be said for using at least one movie in a franchise to set up your potential shared universe as both the Mummy reboot and Batman V. Superman attempted and failed to do just that and this is an issue that many films like them have suffered from as they try in desperation to ride the coattails of what The Avengers had already done so perfectly, but the clumsy way that Sony tried to achieve the world building in The Amazing Spiderman 2 makes the shared universe building in Iron Man 2 look certainly delicate by comparison. Now, if a movie can create a world from the ground up and make it feel organic and lived-in, then that's perfectly fine. Hell, this is something many big movies have tried to do since the release of Star Wars and for the most part, almost all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films have even been able to pull off the perfect balance between including easter eggs for fans of the comics and also letting the films be their own thing. But in The Amazing Spiderman 2, Sony executives and Avi Arad feel the need to throw everything and the kitchen sink into the movie. Given how the character of Electro feels more like a side note rather than having an actual purpose in the film and Harry Osborne only becomes the Green Goblin towards the end of the film much like Venom did in Spiderman 3, the story in the film like it's trying to fire on all cylinders, rushing towards a third Amazing Spiderman film where Sony, the writers, Avi and even Marc Webb would have said that is where all the cool stuff will happen rather than focusing on what is happening in the movie itself and there's an even bigger problem even if Webb had made a third Amazing Spiderman film. By associating the creation of the villains along with Spiderman to Oscorp and Harry, the possibilities that the shared universe has are made small and trivial. Sony attempting to develop numerous films from the Spiderman cannon already felt like complete insanity and given how underwhelming The Amazing Spiderman 2 was, the further projects that Sony has lined up after Venom doesn't make me feel any more optimistic about what they may unleash upon us particularly now that Spiderman has been yanked out of the MCU.<br/><br/>One of the best things that divides the character of Spiderman from many of the other Marvel and DC superheroes is his blue-collar everyman quality. He's not a super-soldier, a billionaire in a high-tech suit of armor or a razor-clawed mutant with a healing factor, he's just an everyday nerdy kid who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time but ueses his powers for good simply because that's the kind of person he is.

","This was very messy, if it wasn't for the second half of the movie this would garbage. For the first half we get, a reason Pete's parents left, introduction and origin of Electro, Harry Osborn introduction, showing Oscorps inner evil, what Aunt May, Gwen and Peter's relationship woes and a 15 minute action sequence that adds nothing to the film. There is so much crammed into the first half I'm surprised I didn't get whiplash, some of the set up works like Harry, Electro and Oscorp but the rest is just so unnecessary. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy Peter's parents but it actually set the ending up in quite a smart way, the action sequence was good as well but apart from kind of connecting to the ending doesn't add anything the narrative of the movie. There are some weird things in here like the relationship with Gwen, it worked so well in the first one their chemistry was on fire but here it just felt very clunky and didn't really mesh too well with what they portrayed in the first. Gwen is given a little bit more to do but much like the action sequence it doesn't really add much to the movie, there are other way to show their feelings.<br/><br/>I will say Jamie Foxx was awesome, granted what he was given wasn't the best. His character takes a massive leap for no reason but there is never a dull moment when he's on screen though, he just chews the scenery. Dane Dehaan does similar thing but there isn't a negative with anything he does in fact I'd say he's probably the best written character. Which is weird because he was such a vital part of the original trilogy, you'd think seeing him again wouldn't be compelling but it was. There two are easily the reason to watch this, everything else is just fairly ok with some good parts.<br/><br/>The ending of this was fantastic, it gets me every time. Just wished they'd mixed this and the alternative together then it'd bring 2 subplots to a close nicely instead of having to choose between the 2. That's a small gripe as it only effects 2 minutes of the ending overall but doesn't subtract from it too much.<br/><br/>Much like Spider-Man 3, there was a lot of studio interference they wanted to do one thing whilst Marc Webb wanted to do something else. This could have been great if they had let him take the reins, shame though as they just over stuffed the movie with fluff."

","I'll be candid, I didn't watch this movie at one go - which may be an argument against the movie itself. Having just watched the first film, I wanted to see how the 2nd one continued the story. Watching it in 2019, my expectations from this sequel were at bay as I had already known of the mixed response to this film.<br/><br/>Things started off okay as the opening scene with spider-man came along. The visuals were much brighter than the first one, the suit much more faithful to the comics, and the spider-man seemed more quippy.<br/><br/>Of course, Paul Giamatti's character (who wasn't Rhino yet) already gave me a sense that the villains in this film were not to be taken seriously - given their somewhat-nonsensical actions, the motivations thereof, and even just the dialogue delivery being synonymous to the 'pure evilness' of villains - who did things just to 'be evil'.<br/><br/>The opening scene was further intercut with a scene where Peter's high-school batch were graduating, and Gwen giving a speech as the valedictorian. The way these two scenes were intercut felt incoherent and without motivation other than to show these two events occurring simultaneously.<br/><br/>This incoherency also gave me a sense that the film and its plot were to follow the same suit.<br/><br/>There's no denying that Electro's character had really no development or motivation to do what he does in the film. The character went from being a caricature of a nerdy Spider-man admirer straight to becoming a caricature of being a Spider-man hater without any formidable reason other than ""Spider-man did not remember my name.""<br/><br/>Speaking of which, all the villains in this movie are just caricatures of the evil, up-to-no-good villains prevalent in action movies before the 80s, comic books and even story books written for children.<br/><br/>Everything about them was unfortunately repulsive - the performances, their non-existent arcs or character development, and their insignificant relevance to the protagonist, story and plot.<br/><br/>I stopped watching the movie right before the Electro boss fight, as I already knew by that point what would happen in the story later on. There was no reason for me to continue watching the film, as I wasn't keen on watching Electro (given his character's poor development and execution), neither did the film make me care enough to see Spider-man defeat him.<br/><br/>The role of Gwen felt rather ambiguous and vague, as though her only purpose was to be a token romance character for Peter to care for. Her motivations for doing certain things had no weight for justifying her existence in this film other than to simply set up her (SPOILER) death at the end.<br/><br/>Coming to Hans Zimmer's score, I actually liked the dubstep score of the Electro fight - despite the fact that Electro 'making' that music made absolutely no sense. But the score did add some needed tension onto the CGI-heavy fight between Spidey and Electro.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Zimmer composed a special theme for Spiderman which rightly gives off a 'hopeful' vibe, but the theme itself is overused in the movie to the point that its' impact diminishes with every use of it.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I have a somewhat special connection to the final few scenes (except the futile Sinister Six setup). Being in a dark moment of my own life, I could somewhat relate to Peter going through his period of grief and finally getting over it. This credits solely to Andrew Garfield's performance, since the screenplay added nothing to make me feel for him.<br/><br/>In a scene where Peter watches a video of Gwen's valedictorian speech, a particular line struck a chord with me:<br/><br/>""It's easy to feel hopeful on a beautiful day like today, but there will be dark days ahead of us too. There will be days where you feel all alone, and that's when hope is needed most.""<br/><br/>Although, the way the speech ended up in Peter's laptop made no sense, since there weren't any cameras shown to record her speech in the graduation the way it was shown in the laptop.<br/><br/>The ending scene with Rhino had only one good thing - Peter finally getting up from his state of grief to fight back.<br/><br/>Other than that, the scene was terrible overall - Paul Giamatti's 'crazed' performance, the way it was shot with shaky cam and abrupt zoom-in shots, the CGI of Giamatti inside the Rhino suit, and the convenience of no casualties suffered (especially among the cops) despite the enormity of Rhino's attack.<br/><br/>Even Peter's motivations of becoming Spider-man again was very sudden and poorly shown, intercutting between him looking at his suit, smiling and the Rhino making an appearance. Peter conveniently became Spider-man at the same time as the Rhino wreaks havoc, having no correlation between the two.<br/><br/>In my opinion, what would have made the scene better was to show the escalating tension of the Rhino wreaking havoc, and this resulting Peter in having to return as Spider-man to save the city that relies on him.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the film consists of several sub-plots and setups that are incredibly futile in the primary plot-line - the pointless and shoddy set-up of Sinister Six, the disappearance of Peter's parents, the inclusion of Norman & Harry Osborn and the possible separation of Peter and Gwen.<br/><br/>Overall, I can say that the film is somewhat like an insignificant greeting card - all shine and glitter without any valuable or meaningful text to it. The characters and overall story lacked depth and relevance that had potential to the film more compelling, resulting in the audiences not being able to care about anyone or anything in the story...<br/><br/>..which explains why Sony decided to move on and finally collaborate with Marvel on the character, a move we're all grateful for."
"williampsamuel","6","0","3","15 March 2019"," A weak but fairly entertaining sequel
","Despite lingering doubts about the necessity of a reboot, the Amazing Spider Man was a resounding success and it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. Well now it's here, and it's a fun movie that will please a lot of audiences, but it's not as good as it could have been or as the last movie was. This is not to say that ASM 2 is another Spider Man 3, which was itself not as terrible as a lot of people remember it being. ASM 2 has great acting and heart pumping action, and at no point does it induce cringes or bad laughter, it's just that it tries to do more than it should and not all the pieces fit together perfectly.<br/><br/>This installment picks up roughly where the last left off, with Peter fighting crime as Spider Man while struggling to choose between his love for Gwen Stacy and his promise to her dying father. Unanswered questions still linger about his parents as well, and but it's developments within Oscorp that pose the greatest threat as a freak accident turns mild mannered underdog Maxwell Dillon into the powerful villain Electro and Harry Osborn's search for a cure to the disease which killed his father drives him in increasingly dark directions.<br/><br/>The movie's strong point is its acting. Despite being a Brit, James Garfield perfectly fits the role of goofy all American teenager Peter Parker. He's more than a bit nerdy, often awkward, and spouts quips and cheesy one liners like a pro. Leading lady Emma Stone is just as good. Plucky, intelligent, and undeniably cute, she makes the perfect sidekick/love interest for Peter. Buoyed by the exceptional chemistry befitting their real life relationship, their scenes together make for one of the better on screen teen romances of recent years, and it would have been nice if this element had been played up more.<br/><br/>The bad guys also make quite the impression. Jamie Fox seems like an odd choice to play Electro, but he works. As Maxwell Dillon he's so pathetic, so earnest, so downtrodden at every turn that you can't help feel sorry for him. But when he decides that he's had enough of being kicked around and gains the power to do something about it, he gets downright scary. Dane DeHaan also puts in good work as Harry Osborn. Not as charismatic or as versatile as James Franco was, he nonetheless is more brooding, calculating, and borderline obsessive, making him a more convincing Goblin.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. The main problem with the movie is that there are simply too many characters and subplots. Most of plot threads are well written and contribute to the main narrative, but together they give the runtime a cluttered feel and the transitions between them are often somewhat rough. The start- or perhaps I should say resumption- of Peter's search for the truth about his parent's death is particularly abrupt and oddly timed. At times the plot also relies on characters making incredibly stupid decisions, but given their circumstances I suppose their choices are plausible.<br/><br/>Now I'm afraid I can't continue any further without getting into spoiler territory, so consider yourself warned. Fans have known that it was only a matter of time until Gwen Stacy died tragically, and this is that time. Her death, at the hands of the Green Goblin of course- was well handled, the modest changes to the circumstances taking nothing away from its impact. Yet I can't help shake the feeling that in a movie featuring her famous death scene, it should be the main villain who kills her. Her death should be the climax of Spider Man's last fight with the Green Goblin, not the first. I just hope the filmmakers will use this as the basis of a bitter feud with the Goblin.<br/><br/>While the movie has a very good ending, it fails to recognize it as such and continues with another fifteen minutes of material that would have been better left to the first act of the next movie. Despite its very real and sometimes serious faults, I still mostly enjoyed Amazing Spider Man 2 and wouldn't have minded another instalment. Overall it's not the home run its predecessor was, but as a fun summer action movie it mostly works."

","Dear lord this was just one painful minute after another. The only truly redeeming part of this haphazard sequel was the casting of Jamie Foxx as Electro. His performance is stellar amidst (and in spite of) the drudging script and an ensemble of cringe-worthy performances from the rest of the cast. But that's really all it has going for it. The graphics aren't much better or any more believable than the first ""Amazing Spiderman"" of which this is based. I appreciated the overall plot line somewhat, but not enough to suggest that anyone else subject themselves to the 2+ hours of torture. This movie, in fact, isn't even good enough to have playing in the background while you are working on something else and aren't even paying attention to it. I actually would like to keep writing about how bad this movie really is, but I keep getting more and more worked up as I go along, and I'm afraid I might blow a fuse in my brain if I get bent out of shape any further. Moral of the story: Amazing Spider-Man 2: Twice the amount of Un-Amazingness."

","Director Marc Webb is not the one to blame for this travesty of a superhero flick, nor is Andrew Garfield, I blame Sony for their awful attempts at a cinematic universe, and their constant product placement where I played a game of pointing out how many Sony products there were. The story is lackluster, and has so many plot-points that are either dropped, or go nowhere. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Spider-man is much more lighthearted and fun but confusing on his motivations. The story continues from the also dropped plot points of the first Amazing Spider-man movie and does nothing satisfying nor entertaining with it. Jamie Fox's Electro is the only fun part, he tries his best with the dumb cartoonish character he is given. The green goblin is a wasted villain who only exists to be put on the poster, as with Rhino who is awful and cartoony in this film. The music is awful, Hanz Zimmer doesn't seem like he put any effort into the score, and Pharell Williams puts out of place songs everywhere. The special effects are amazing with the Spider-man web slinging shots looking the most realistic, and are overall fun. The plot is dumb, the writing is atrocious, but it's the best looking Spider-man movie ever made. This film has a little bit of style, but no substance. If you're a die-hard Spider-man fan, than just turn your brain off, or watch it out of curiosity."

","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is my guilty pleasure movie. It's so hilariously weird and absurd. In the beginning we get Paul Giamatti yelling absolute gibberish hilariously, while there's like 30 police cars which crash all on each other. I mean Spiderman literally jokes around while people die.<br/><br/>However this movie also has some great stuff. The returning cast is still great, and I think we got the best Spider-man in this film. His suit is the most accurate and looks the best out of all the movies. He's cracking jokes moderately, while still staying serious when he needs to be (for the most part...). He's also clearly capable, and smart. This is how Spider-man should be.<br/><br/>If I'd have to say some genuinely great things about this movie would be the music and visuals. The visuals are gorgeous and the cinematography makes it all better. The music is also really great, having ominous music for Harry, and (my personal favorite) dubstep theme for Electro.<br/><br/>The villains are a mixed bag. The Rhino is barely in the movie and he's just silly screaming.<br/><br/>Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) was pretty good. However I don't think we got enough development for his character, and once he turns into Green Goblin not only does he look horrific, but he becomes completely insane, laughing like a literal mad man, and it ruined the character a little for me. The movie rushes to make us care for him, and rushes Peter's friendship with him. I mean in the last movie peter went to oscorp, Harry's company, and there's no mention. Their friendship should've been set up previously or established in the last movie. He has the motivations, he's dying and his father (who has this Hereditary disease?! And is green?! That is also weird...) who has neglected him his entire life, tells him he's literally dying, and is giving him the company, whilst Donald Menken is trying to take the company away from him by framing him. It's overwhelming for him. I think he could've been perfectly set up for the next film, but it was rushed for this one. Also it took 40 years for his father to die, I don't get why he's so upset, he has a few decades to live. Rushing him also made us get peter unfortunately have to email J. Jonah Jameson being reduced to an appearance via email, so Peter could have the relation ship with Spiderman needed for Harry. I also thought his transformation to ""The Goblin"" didn't really make sense, and his suit is saving him now despite his father saying they have no cure yet? I did like Harry, but he was very rushed and Green Goblin looks disgusting.<br/><br/>Electro (Jamie Foxx) was, in my opinion, actually really good. I loved Jamie Foxx's performance and the look. Electro's motivations are perfect, and to top it all off he is schizophrenic, so it maximizes everything for him. Everyone is always either making fun off him, or ignoring him, and he's dying for attention. Not only that, but he's constantly neglected and his work was literally stolen, but he's afraid to speak up, because then he believes people will like him even less. We get him imagining our burst of what he wants to do, and I think this is a great way to show the pain he's going through. AND ITS HIS BIRTHDAY. Also he's a huge Spiderman fanatic and he gets saved by him. Spiderman of course being a nice guy tells Max he needs him. Max of course takes this literally and when he actually meets Spiderman again (after he's gotten his powers in a very silly way) It's the perfect time to get him against him, and I thought it was done in a great way. Max looks for the area with the most electricity and goes there. It's a very crowded place of course. People seeing what he's doing are afraid and the police intervenes. He doesn't know how to control his power and is scared himself, accidentally attacking the police. However he finally gets the spotlight, people actually ""see"" him, but Spiderman comes (already having forgotten his name) and takes the spotlight, and then despite Spiderman telling them to not shoot, they do shoot him, making him feel betrayed. In the his theme you hear him whispering to himself ""he lied to me, he shot at me, he hates on me, he's using me, he's dead to me, he is my ENEMY"" This is the point where his snap, the only thing he cared about has ""betrayed"" him. You might think it doesn't make sense, but he's schizophrenic, to him everyone is against him, and he now realized he can take them himself, he's a ""god"" to them. This was just perfect for me, and I think Electro was such a great villain. He just really worked for me, however I do wish we got more of him despite him actually having a lot of screentime.<br/><br/>This movie also has another issue. It doesn't have a consistent tone. The movie begins with a jokey Spiderman, and a villain who's literally yelling gibberish, to the end of the movie where we get a horrifying, and disgusting goblin who literally kills Gwen, and Peter literally grabs her dead body and cries for 2 minutes, and it shows him going to her grave every day for the entire year. Like holy crap that is dark, and then at the end the screaming rhino guy is back?! What the hell?! I do think Gwen's death was really well done though. Emma Stone (Gwen) and Andrew Garfield (Peter) were actually dating at the time, and it shows, they have great chemistry. Gwen once again wasn't a one dimensional damsel in distress she actually does things, and when she does die it's actually sad. Just looking at Peter crying over her (great performance by Andrew Garfield) is just sad. Especially realizing that this was exactly what Gwen's father didn't want happening, and peter had promised.<br/><br/>I also think that was done very well, with Peter suffering PTSD from his death, Uncle Ben's and Captain Stacy's death really carries to this movie.<br/><br/>From this we also get some weird and stupid sub plot with Peter's Parents. Honestly having shown why Peter's parent left could've been great, but then we get this sub plot where peter literally gets a calculator from his bag, opens it, finds metro coins, goes to an abandoned subway and a train comes up from the ground revealing a video explaining everything, and to top it all off it turns out that Peter was special because he was the only person that the spider could've worked on. This just ruins Peter. He should be the average nerd, but now he's been special all along and destined for this? What if he never got bitten and the spiders did die?! It makes no sense and it's so dumb.<br/><br/>There's a lot more I like and I dislike from this movie. The Easter eggs like having Felisha (Black Cat) and Alistar Smythe as actual characters in the movie being set up for the future is great, but then it's over done with literally showing the entire sinister six in a room.<br/><br/>They also did something I really liked. Having set up things like over changing a battery when Peter tries to fix his web shooters, and saving the kid, coming back at the end. I thought it was done very well and it shows development for peter and other characters.<br/><br/>I also did think this movie had some genuinely good dialogue.<br/><br/>Despite having some great stuff, the movie does feel extremely stuffed, and it's a mess. Overall this film had a lot of great, but also a lot of bad. It felt rushed trying to set up the sinister 6, but it still managed to be an enjoyable movie, and get you excited for the future. Unfortunately we will never see the future of this universe and that's a shame.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

It's not good and that's something almost every film critic agrees on.
And gonna give my reasons to why it's bad.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN
Spider-Man is way better in this movie than the last one.
He actually consistently cracks jokes but of course there is a problem with that.
First the jokes fall flat 98% of the time the jokkes Spider-Man throws around are the simplest jokes you can come up with and none of them are good.
There was one joke in the movie that made me chuckle and that was when Spider-Man teamed up with fire men to splash water on Electro.
It made me chuckle a bit but that was the only time the movie made me chuckle.
or sorry that was a lie there was this other scene when Harry said ""I'm dying Peter.""
That got me laughing.
Overall Spider-Man in the movie is a 6/10 in the last movie he was a 4/10 which is an improvement.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Idk what to say about the characters.
i never liked any of them i never hated any of them.
Aunt may is still there to worry and be stressed about everything.
Gwen is now an independent wamen who can make her own decisions.
It's always a thing in these movies that when a character is supposed to die in the movie they make sure that they are there to die they don't have any other importance than to die.
And that's the same for Gwen stacy she is an independent wamen just so that she could die.
She gets herself into these crazy situations where she could die and her excuse is that she makes her own decisions.
Peter in this movie was fine i wish i have something to say about him but i don't so lets move on to the villains.<br/><br/>VILLAINS
The villains are what made this movie so bad.
I don't even know Electro's motivation to kill Spider-Man or i think is that they are teasing him and they think that he is a monster and that is a weak motivation that never gets talked about or developed.
Electro is just has no personality.
But Harry he is probably worse.
He is a character that never got talked about in the last movie they never even said his name there and then they just say in the sequel.
""Yeah Peter and Harry where best friends they did a lot together:""
And it just blows my mind that they did that.
Harry has some personality which is good.
And his motivation for killing Spider-Man is that he needs his blood that motivation isn't completely bad and is in my opinion mediocre.
But when Harry turns into Green Goblin then he is a worse character but luckily we never got to see how bad Green Goblin could have been.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action is way better in this movie it looks so cool and great but it's not really that creative or dose anything new.
They never do anything new with Spider-Man's combat skills in this franchise which leaves the action just mediocre.
This is a nitpick but why whenever Spider-Man is gonna fight some evil dude why do people watch him fight shouldn't the police make sure that the people are as far away from the crime as possible.
But anyway the action overall is mediocre.<br/><br/>TONE
The tone is way more different in this movie and that's why i thought at the time that this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen.
I was dumb back then.
But i like the tone it's different and looks way more cooler but the movie is still bad<br/><br/>CGI
In my opinion the CGI looks amazing it's so beautiful to look at Spider-Man fighting the villains but that's another small thing i wanted to talk about.<br/><br/>SUIT
The suit looks way better it doesn't look like a basketball this time and i would say it's one of the best Spider-Man suits.<br/><br/>THE RELATIONSHIP
It's mediocre.
I like the scene where Peter and Gwen where talking about ground rules.
The topic of ground rules was stupid but the chemistry between them was good and it seemed genuine when they talked to each other.
But keep in mind that was the only scene where the chemistry showed cause the other scenes when they where together felt really empty they should have kept the chemistry between them consistent but they didn't.<br/><br/>VERDICT
don't hate me for this but i like this movie more than the last one cause i hated the last movie.
This movie is bad and i wont deny that it's the worst Spider-Man movie but i liked it more than the last one and the reason is that i felt less annoyed about the flaws of this movie and i would rather watch this one than the first one.
But they should really just ignore the parents stuff about this movie cause that stuff is unnecessary.
Don't watch this movie"

The acting, unlike the original, is awful. No one is enthusiastic about anything and literally no one gave a damn. Electro looks stupid and his origin is just as stupid and Peter's romance with Gwen is inconsistent and not believable in the slightest. It's not as dark as the original but when it does try to get dark and dramatic they fail on every level.

","This follow up to the Andrew Garfield-starring reboot of the SPIDER-MAN franchise is marginally better than its predecessor, but that really isn't saying much. This is another overblown, bloated, and unappealing mess of a movie, with a ridiculously overlong running time at two and a half hours. It just goes on and on and on, through the same old plot scenarios (the Green Goblin AGAIN?) and cheesy romance already witnessed in the Sam Raimi trilogy, and failing to add anything new whatsoever. Okay, so the CGI web-slinging scenes are better, but the film is still light and superficial and doesn't even try to connect on an emotional level. Garfield is stuck playing an immature character and the rest of the cast aren't much better. This film is at its best in the energetic opening and closing sequences, both starring a cameoing Paul Giamatti, and in the scenes involving Jamie Foxx's entertaining villain. The rest is merely mundane, and the 3D effects are completely uninspiring too."
"barberoux-15943","3","0","1","14 March 2018"," Adolescent Schmaltz
","Maybe I should have expected this movie to be bad. The previous Spiderman movies with Toby Maguire were coated in a syrupy view of life. Virgin youth fighting cartoonish villains in a rich man's landscape. This one is more of the same, just worse. Andrew Garfield portrayed Peter Parker as an impatient, sullen teen laying around his room. Then swinging about in New York with a whole different personality. Emma Stone portrays his girlfriend who graduates high school and in the next scene in a high tech Oscorp corporate job. What? The movie portrays a rich man's landscape where those to be envied are the 1%ers and the battlefield is New York where this week's monster villain sprays bullets at random, but no one is actually killed. Blocks of New York are destroyed but no one is actually killed. No one is shown homeless due to the goings on. Ridiculous. Maybe it is the intended audience they are appealing to, teens and man-children. I can suspend belief and enjoy Sci-fi movies but the landscape has to be just a bit believable. Consequences happen, except in Marvel movies.
Poor Jamie Foxx is one of the villains, unrecognizable under makeup after the transformation. He is cast as a nerd, a nobody. See nerds are still acceptable to make fun of, to be the focus of human meanness. Previously that person would have been a Stepin Fetchit or some ethnic class but that is no longer PC to do but the meanness is still there. The desire to ridicule, the need to have a justification for offensive behavior. It's fun for the audience to make fun of people. You just have to pick the ones no one will object to. So the nerd. Jerry Lewis made a whole career out of it.
Typically the action sequences were filled with CGI that ignores any real physics but are fun to watch. Human interactions are sappy, banal, and adolescent. It would be nice to see a special effects movie peopled by complex adults. I guess the audience isn't there."
"TheMovieDiorama","5","0","1","25 February 2018"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 swings into an overstuffed mess.
","I have to applaud Sony for their ambition, I mean you can literally see that they wanted to create a reinvigorated Spider-Man franchise so badly. It oozes exposition and universe building that it has now become a detriment to the film itself. Peter Parker, having now saved the city once, is entangled in another threatening situation(s) where his number one fan is involved in a freak accident that leaves him with electrifying powers. Having forgot about him, Spider-Man has now made a sworn enemy who simply just wants to be noticed. Whilst this is happening, Harry Osborn takes over his father's company but is battling his own personal hereditary disease in which he needs Spider-Man's blood to save him. Don't forget though, Gwen Stacy wants to move to England for her education so Peter must deal with his one true love and prevent her from leaving. Oh wait there's more! The Rhino is apparently in this wreaking havoc (for all of 2 minutes). Felicity Jones...wait, Felicity Jones is in this? Oh yeah, she is. Aunt May has to work double time which sounds exhausting. A blackout occurs which leaves two planes flying blind, will they collide!? Peter investigates the mysterious disappearance of his father. There's lust for power in Oscorp and to top it all off, Max's teeth get magically straightened when he turns into Electro...yes, I'm done. To say this film is overstuffed would be an understatement. There is far too much happening and hardly any of them interconnect. They are separate plot points where most feel unnecessary. Who even cares if Aunt May works double time? Who is Felicia...wait, Felicity Jones? Really? Oh yes...I see her. Having three villains in one film just doesn't work. Focus on one, or two if necessary...but three is overkill. The action scenes with Electro were pretty, and actually compelling. I applaud the final ten minutes to kill off a certain character, was a damn bold move which paid off. Just unfortunate the rest of the film is a mess."

","Amazing Spiderman 2 is Sony trying to do The-Avengers-Thing: shared universe building and setting up. Why do this for something that's as self-contained as Spiderman and why do this when the film rights to the character and his relatives were (initially) very limited to just the central character himself and rather limited villains to choose from. Well, they decided that The Amazing Spiderman 2 was going to be Spiderman: And The Set-Up Of The SpiderVerse Or Something. IT tries and succeeds at SOME good moments here and there, but the whole adds up to an uneven and overstuffed and not wholly satisfying experience.<br/><br/>Spiderman is one of the greatest characters to have ever been conceived in comics: and it took til Spiderman: Homecoming to bring the character back to his roots of being a high-schooler trying to juggle superhero life with his personal life and not worry about building a bajillion sequels to a start-up franchise. Unfortunately, all the stuff Homecoming DIDN'T have to worry about is exactly what ruined The Amazing Spiderman movies in the first place."

","15 Expected it to be an utter crap & it truly lived up to that prediction. After opening with a pretty good prologue, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a downhill trip from there & follows Peter Parker enjoying his life fighting crime as Spider-Man but having hallucinations of Gwen Stacy's deceased dad whenever he is with her. But soon he has other things to deal with as new villains in town arrive starting with a Spider-Man obsessed fan who after a mishap mutates into Electro. Next comes Harry Osborn who later transforms into Green Goblin & last we have Rhino but the less I talk about this ass-wimp, the better it is.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb tries to do so many things at once in this sequel that the movie as a whole becomes entangled in its own webbing & not a single one of its sub-plots come out as well as one would've liked. The screenplay is dull, camera-work is more focused on 3D experience than contributing to the story, editing leaves so many unnecessary scenes in tact, VFX is where most of its quarter-billion budget seems to have been expended, the entire plot has no sense of direction, characterization is poor & even Hans Zimmer's music fails to deliver this time.<br/><br/>The very few things likable about it is the new Spidey costume which now closely resembles the comic books look, the Gwen/Peter chemistry that's on or off throughout the film, Peter/Harry friendship that should've been further explored & the scenes involving Aunt May which feel most authentic on an emotional scale. The recurring cast has done the same job they did in the last film, adding nothing new to talk about in this one. Jamie Foxx hams his way through as Electro, Dane DeHaan has better moments as Harry than Green Goblin & Paul Giamatti's Rhino is far worse than imaginable.<br/><br/>And don't be blinded by the false advertisement going on here as Electro plays the main villain, Green Goblin is present only during the final moments but not for too long & Rhino almost doesn't even exist in this film. On an overall scale, the 2nd chapter of this needlessly rebooted franchise delivers another lackluster cinematic experience & proves that the team has learned nothing from the mistakes it made in the last movie. Adding more extravagant elements into its production only to later end up choking on it, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is far less amazing than what it's selling itself as. Do yourself a favour & waste your money on something else"

","Marc Webb directs and critics pan this sequel; but fans have various opinions. I find this feature at times a little disjointed and some scenes tend to be pointless. But, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is a very good escape. A refill of popcorn was due this time. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is having problems dealing with his conscience trying to keep his promise to leave his main squeeze Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) out of his dangerous life. New York City is rapidly falling deeper into the grip of Oscorp. Spider-Man will have to defend the city against the powerful villain Electro (Jamie Foxx), and that battle will constitute all of the viewers attention. Great F/X. If this is not enough, an old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHann), adds to problems relating to Oscorp. Peter and Gwen will compromise their inner-most feelings and our hero will uncover more clues to his past.<br/><br/>I did find myself getting a bit irritated with Spider-Man's sporadic grins to the camera and his attempts at humor. But no doubt about it, Mr. Garfield is many times better than watching Toby Maguire. I wish that Peter and Gwen could have shared the same spark and sizzle in the relationship from the last movie.

A broken movie isn't necessarily bad ,for instance 12 Monkeys is a broken movie ,but it is quit good. No here we have the bad type, because its story lines within the movie are related with a very dumb way and they made the same mistake as Spiderman 3: too many villains. Also Andrew Garfield portrait of Spiderman is to over the top for me and to put simple does not convince me that is a true hero, just a teenager who have powers and has fun with them. And the villains ,o boy they are even more stupid than Spiderman 3, there at least they had some understandable reason to hate Spiderman, but here they were just some ugly CGI creatures. The only thing going for is the chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone and the opening apart of that is pretty boring.

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has technical merits. However, these merits are impossible to enjoy in a film drowned from beginning to end in the sickening narcissism of both its purported hero and supposedly tragic villains.I give you The Amazing Spider-Man: a hero with no principles and no goals.by sometimes he only cares about his girlfriend and sometimes wants to know what happened to his parents, but day-to-day he really only cares about doing what he wants to do-- which happens to be helping people, it seems, because it gives them hope.Electro could have been a tragic Frankenstein villain. Instead, because a group of random people roots for Spider-Man over him in his first public appearance, he decides everyone should die. Yup--that's his motivation.I really like spiderman as a series, and I think Andrew Garfield does take on this more gloomy and dark version of spidey/peter parker, it works quite well and I hope that they make many more in the series.but Electro come on, he should have died in that fish tank and not become this electrical super freak evil bad guy. Give me the two other evil enemies at the end, Dane DeHaan really fits his part both as Harry Osborne, but also as the Goblin it is really good.

"thisseatofmars","Null","0","2","4 September 2015"," Leave Garfield alone
","A lot of people are hating on this movie, and recently it's been announced that Andrew Garfield is being replaced by another actor. Garfield was never the problem-- I always bought him as a high school/university student (looks young.) <br/><br/>No, the problem was the direction and stories of the movies. Like with the first movie--why would you, for the millionth time, feature Peter Parker's origin story? We all already know he was bitten by a radioactive spider-- we grew up with cartoon after cartoon, comic after comic, and *three* movies directed by Sam Raimi featuring the same back story.<br/><br/>Seeing the origin (yet) again sloooowed the movie to a (spider) crawl. The first film takes *foever* to get going, what with the spider bite, uncle Ben getting murdered for his $30 bucks or whatever, and Aunt May's secret hash addiction-- and the costume in the first movie was just bad.<br/><br/>Not to mention The Lizard had as much appeal/personality/charisma as a plank of wood. The Lizard is meant to hate humanity-- in the comics, he hates humans like how the KKK hates non-whites-- and that's how he should've been played (as an insane, rage-fueled species-ist.) The real Lizard foams at the mouth when he sees us naked apes walking about our cities and shopping malls, paving over his green forests to make our concrete jungles. Seeing but a shred of that energy would've helped the first movie.<br/><br/>The second movie was alright, in my opinion-- Jamie Fox(x?) played a sympathetic villain who wasn't a mad scientist like Doc Ock, Norm Osbourne, or The Lizard-- he was a company worker twisted by social isolation (something that most Internet dwellers can identify with.) Electro was cool, had a cool theme, and I'd love to see Fox (two x's? WTH?) reprise the role if there is a sinister six movie.<br/><br/>Where the second ASM mucks up is the Green Goblin (yawn) and the Emma Stone romance subplot (tripple-whammy-with-cheese yawn.) HOLY LORD the scenes with Emma Stone dragged way, way too long. Yes-- Peter misses her, blah-blah-blah hey can we see some more of Spiderman not being a total pansy please? How about you have him tease JJ Jameson, fight The Shocker, or fight some bullies, 'k? <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong-- romantic trouble has always been part of the Peter Parker/Spiderman formula, but it was unbalanced in this movie. Maybe they were trying to cash in on the fact Emma Stone is a bankable actress right now (hashtags #overrated #loud) but romantic troubles bother Parker at the edge of his mind, while he has to save NY as Spiderman. He was never obsessed with his girlfriends to the point of stalking, like in this second movie.<br/><br/>Then there's the Green Goblin. He looked like an 80's rock star riddled with every STD and STI in the book. They've fouled up his design so many times-- his metal-plastic mask in the first trilogy was one of the weaker aspects.

","The most amazing thing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is how short a memory Hollywood has. Only seven years prior, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 caused a shock wave of contempt so cataclysmic the only feasible recover was to stall for five years, then reboot the series. ""Never again,"" intoned Sony executives, fearfully, ""will we stuff a Spider-Man film with so many subplots, villains, and extraneous Goblins! We've learned our lesson. Never again!"" <br/><br/>Heh.<br/><br/>I could pontificate about how overcrowded, unfocused, and tonally imbalanced Mark Webb's follow-up to his first Amazingly-mishandled Spider-Man is, but that's self-evident (consolation: no skateboarding to Coldplay montage here. Shudder). Instead, I propose an alternate means of consumption. Seeing as Webb's Big Mac of a superhero film contains at least three shorter, more cohesive films therein, and since we, thanks to the magic of blu-ray, have the option of fast-forwarding at liberty, I propose you pick the Spider-Man film you'd most like to see, skip all the redundant mush, and just watch that film instead. Think of it as a cinematic 'choose your own adventure story'! <br/><br/>Personally, I'm a fan of the first option: a lilting, lighthearted action-comedy vignette, just like the Spider-Man I grew up with! We open with Spider-Man swinging through the city, whooping away, the cheerful score of Hans Zimmer and his five co-composer buddies (no joke) chirping along, in pursuit of bad ol' puddy-tat Paul Giamatti and his truck full of stolen plutonium. This is about as close as cinema has ever gotten to a live-action cartoon: pastel colours, slapstick, insane action (including a police car pileup that hilariously upstages The Blues Brothers), and all-around fun. Andrew Garfield bouncing around, firing off dad jokes, is spot-on as Spidey, and Giamatti, spittle flying left and right as he grunts and snorts in his goofy Russian accent like a real rhinoceros, has surely tapped into some kind of method genius. Then, instead of the plodding middle two hours, maintain the fun and cut to the end. Oh no! Giamatti's back, nonsensically sporting a ridiculously daft mechanical suit, and helpfully naming his action figure by bellowing ""Ayy Hyam de Rchynooooo!"" You couldn't ask for a more heightened, cartoon climax: a standoff between Giamatti's knave and a bespectacled boy. Just in time: rack-focus to the real Spider-Man, who fist-bumps the kid and takes over. Genuinely affecting tears and cheers, and a heroic anticlimax urges you to tune in next week, same Spider-time, same Spider-channel. Magnificent. <br/><br/>Some may prefer the second film-within-a-film: a wacky, campy body-horror action thriller, as if concocted by David Cronenberg at a Skrillex concert. Meet Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon: an earnest, super-nerd so imbalanced we are subjected to an excruciatingly long sequence of him having an imaginary conversation with Spider-Man, straight into the camera (my second-hand-embarrassment senses are tingling!). Max predictably meets with a horrible accident, being bitten by (um) genetically-modified electric eels, and becoming the frightful, glowing, blue Mr. FreezElectro. Who controls electricity. Electro is a misunderstood monster, but quickly notices how his vilification grants his lonely existence exposure for the first time. But just when the film verges on momentary profundity, Spider-Man arrives to bash him about. In the ensuing (fairly exciting) battles, Max discovers his true calling as a dubstep artist, now providing the film with its wub-wub-wub-soundtrack in a creative choice so batsh*t it's either inspired or risible, depending on how stupefied the viewer already is. Max is subsequently tormented in prison by Martin Czokas' disturbingly over-the-top ""Europeeank"" Dr. Kafka, before he and his silly wet-suit are finally short-circuited by our hissable villain, Spider-Man. RIP Max. <br/><br/>Finally, for those three audience members who still jeer that our enjoyment-based comic book superhero jaunts still aren't gosh-darned serious enough, we have film number three: the melodrama. Behold: the trials of Peter Parker, haunted by the childhood disappearance of his parents and the stupid guilt-ghost of Dennis Leary. Even his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone, tragicomic perfection) is leaving to pursue a prestigious scholarship in England (how selfish). Appropriately, the film's lighting is so grimly grey it's like Peter's Instagram filter is set to 'tar pit'. Thankfully, relief comes in the form of clumsily integrated ol' buddy Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan, valiantly out-acting his asinine dialogue), whohas a dying father. And has inherited his rare, debilitating disease. And decides he needs Spider-Man's super-blood to cure him(?!) Drat. Thankfully, we take a break from the drama llama to adventure with Peter in an embarrassingly contrived subplot to a mysterious deserted subway lab so the script can awkwardly tie off the ill-advised 'parents' preoccupation everyone had already forgotten about. Finally, Peter and Gwen are confronted by a deformed, mutated, screeching Harry, whose conflict is also rushed along by the miracle discovery of a disease-suppressing Power Rangers suit and goblin glider (duh). But this is a SERIOUS fight, involving sharp things, stentorian pleading, and tragic collateral damage: a helpless clock tower suffers for their sins! Oops – I mean the film briefly blinks awake as one of the comic's most iconic moments is realized: Gwen plummets to her death with a shockingly visceral crunch, handled powerfully enough to stun even fans with the original panel breakdown memorized. Garfield is finally allowed to flex his dramatic muscles, and his sobs of disbelief are enough to wrench tears from the most cynical viewer. The film ends on this exquisite heartbreak. Darkness. No parents. Roll credits. <br/><br/>Still. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 should be considered a cautionary tale for the producers of (you guessed it) the next upcoming Spider-Reboot. On behalf of all the spider-fans and real rhinos everywhere who have slumped through a decade of committee-scripted spider-trash: learn from your mistakes. Pick a tone. Stick to ONE storyline and antagonist. And, for heaven's sakes, leave time for re-writes. Better yet: conclusively release the character rights back to Marvel Studios, who are capable of making respectful and fun superhero flicks without such hand-holding.<br/><br/>Excelsior. <br/><br/>-5/10"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","4","17 June 2015"," The Amazing Gwen Stacy
","Two years after Marc Webb (""500 Days of Summer"") relaunched the Spider-Man franchise with Andrew Garfield, he released the second movie. This was also the last one as they probably weren't too happy with the movie not even reaching the Top10 of the year in terms of box office success. They did not make it to three like Sam Raimi did before him and I read about another relaunch coming soon, possibly starring Asa Butterfield from ""Hugo"". Anyway, in the last movie Gwen Stacy's dad died and here, in the end, it is her who has to go. A pretty bold movie getting rid of a central character, but maybe they were also very certain that there would be no third movie. Also, right now, Emma Stone is a much bigger star than her boyfriend Andrew Garfield. Garfield was freshly back from almost scoring an Oscar nomination for ""The Social Network"" during the relaunch, but he has become slightly less significant by now, maybe because he is not really making (m)any other films apart from Spidey. Stone on the other hand just managed her first Oscar nomination for her work in Best Picture winner ""Birdman"". This movie here has a couple more actors who had great success with the Academy in the past, such as winners Sally Field (twice) and Jamie Foxx and nominees Paul Giamatti and Felicity Jones. Jones was actually wasted in this movie. She really has a bit of a nothing role. I am not sure what they were doing here, if they intended to slowly build her up as Parker's love interest in a 3rd film or why they cast her here. Then again, she wasn't as famous as she is today when this was made.<br/><br/>Giamatti also has a pretty small role as a bald Russian mobster, but he was lots of fun actually, especially in the final scene. He plays the least significant out of three antagonists. The other two are played by Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan, who looks a lot like the young Leonardo DiCaprio here. However, he was occasionally over the top and hurt the portrayal of Parker's formally best friend this way. Foxx did an okay job, but his character's story about being invisible, not really existing could have been depicted in a more heartbreaking manner. The ""Happy Birthday to Me"" scene was a good inclusion though. In general, I wonder why they have to go with more than one villain. Actually, the entire film centering around Electro and completely without Osborn would have been a preferred choice for me, especially given the fact that Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin is almost impossible to improve. At least they understood it with Simmons' Jonah Jameson that they cannot top him and did without the character or, to be more precise, only mentioned him occasionally. It's no problem if the movie runs for considerably under 2 hours then, just get some more focus and clarity in there instead of including too many story lines. There's no need for this film to make it to 140 minutes. And even with this running time, the ending feels really rushed. There is so much happening in so little time after Stacy's death. Spider-Man decides not to be a superhero anymore, then goes back to his altruist ways in the end. There have been entire Spider-Man movies about these changes in character in the past.<br/><br/>Anyway, it is very similar to other Spidey films in general. OSCORP plays a crucial role again as always. Seems like there always goes something wrong over there. The movie has many biological and scientific references and Stan Lee also gets his usual cameo. The final battle scene with Electro/Green Goblin and Parker did not do too much for me, but it was saved by the emotional impact of Gwen Stacy's death near the end. Taking everything into account, I'm tempted to say this film is more about her than about everybody's favorite spider. A decent watch, but nothing really outstanding. Recommended."
"Wizard-8","Null","0","11","15 June 2015"," It's okay - could have been worse
","Of the five Spider-Man movies to date that have been made, I feel that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" ranks second just behind the 2004 ""Spider-Man 2"". I wasn't expecting much with this being a sequel to a reboot, but I was pleased to find some good things here. What pleasantly struck me most of all was how much more relaxed the movie felt compared to other modern Hollywood blockbusters, superhero oriented or not. The movie does make an attempt to add some humanity to the movie by a number of scenes with the characters just talking. That isn't to say that the movie doesn't deliver when it comes to action. There is a good amount of action, and it's directed in a way that's both exciting and much easier to follow than the frenzied approach in other modern day action movies. <br/><br/>However, not everything about the movie is successful. One disappointment is with the character of Electro. While his scenes at the beginning of the movie promise that the character will be multi- dimensional, the movie soon makes him your standard screaming one note villain. The subplot with Peter Parker's friend Osborne doesn't seem quite finished; you don't get the feeling that they are close friends. And the end sequence involving the Rhino is embarrassing, from it being one villain too many to the special effects grossly betraying what the character was like in the comic books.<br/><br/>When you weigh the good against the bad, the movie ends up being okay. I've seen better, I've seen worse. But to be honest, I think that the last drops of potential with a cinematic Spider-Man have been milked out with this entry. I would urge Columbia Pictures (and Marvel Entertainment) to not go any further and let the character rest for a number of years before trying again with a perspective that would then be fresh."

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014): Dir: Marc Webb / Cast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Sally Field: Weakest entry in the Spider-Man franchise. This time out we have three villains surface and it becomes overloaded when one can fathom that each single villain could present its own movie in the franchise. Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy graduate from high school but while she delivers her graduation speech, Parker is in full Spider-Man mode fighting evil truckers firing machine guns in a pointless opening action scene. Central plot regards a neglected and unappreciated electrical worker named Max Dillon who ends up electrocuted in a vat with electric eels. He becomes villain Electro whose power drains electricity. Another key character is young Harry Osborn whose father was involved with Parker's father. This leads to the discovery of what happened to his parents. Director Marc Webb is backed with impressive special effects but the screenplay falters with a dreary premise and a depressing climax that follows with a dimwitted cliffhanger. Andrew Garfield as Parker / Spider-Man struggles with his identity and his relationship with Gwen. She is played by Emma Stone who is being pulled in other directions professionally. Jamie Foxx as Electro is somewhat sympathetic. Dane DeHaan plays Osborn / Green Goblin whose obsessed with Spider-Man's immortality. Sally Field as Parker's aunt decides to start working at the hospital in order to best spend her time. She has shielded Parker long enough and the truth of his folks emerges. Amazing special effects countered with a less amazing screenplay. Score: 5 / 10"

","Far and away a better series than the original Spider-Man trilogy. It doesn't look like we will get to see a third installment just due to the fact that Spidey is swinging through the MCU on another reboot. It's just too bad they didn't wait and have this be the MCU reboot. Emma Stone & Garfield are great, both separately and together. He adds some much needed comic relief. Stuff you're actually supposed to laugh at instead of Toby Maguire's stupid dance in the black suit just being funny for how truly bad it was. The story arc they choose to develop in the second installment is a much better choice than the original as well. Looking into the lives of Peter's parents is something the common viewer had no clue about. I hope they continue to explore these stories in the new potentially 9 movie reboot.

","Wasn't bad. Not great either. There is a lot that I didn't like. Dane DeHaan was BAD (remember Emo Peter from Spider-Man 3? Well this is Emo Harry)...I'm not sure how much is his fault and how much was either poor writing or poor direction...either way his performance was laughable. The spectacle of the action scenes is really something, but they get almost completely bogged down by the pointless use of slow-mo. Seriously, it felt like there was more slow-mo in this movie then there was in the THE MATRIX. And lastly... Paul Giamatti is absolutely WASTED in this. It's basically a 1 or 2 minute cameo that's only there to set up the next movie. And his Russian accent is totally incomprehensible. I guess I should say what I liked about it too... Garfield and Stone are really good together. Their chemistry is more or less what makes the movie tolerable. Jamie Foxx's Electro is cool I suppose, but the reasoning behind him becoming bad is pretty silly. <br/><br/>So all-in-all it has more in common with Raimi's Spider-Man 3...which is pretty disappointing, but then again A LOT of these comic book movies have been feeling (to me anyway) like they're all the same. If you're a comic fan or a fan of the character then I'm sure you'll get some enjoyment out of this. Probably much more than I did anyway. Overall I'm teetering somewhere between a 6 and 6.5 out of 10."

","If you have seen The Amazing Spiderman 1, then you know that Marc Webb is a good director. Before this film I admit he had me. And I still think that he has a lot of potential. <br/><br/>What's pretty clear to me is that during pre and post-production for the film, someone wasn't thinking straight. The trailer was awesome! And it was so awesome and got so much recognition, that someone apparently approached the writers and said: ""Hey! Why don't we make a 2,5 hour trailer! That would be awesome too!""<br/><br/>Well, it wasn't. All you get is a Sinister-Six worse-than-ever introduction that never works. It's all just a big, all-over-the-place, huge budget commercial, supposedly for the next movies in the planned Sony Universe. (by the way, I hope that Universe is dead by now.)<br/><br/>Story in 2 lines: Spiderman chooses to ignore the promise he made to Gwen's father (so Spidey is a big fat liar for all we know), he learns more details about his parents' long boring past that is all about secrets, secrets, secrets and he meets Harry Osborn who is creepy as hell. Oh, and don't forget the worst and most-clichéd origin of a villain in the Electro bit.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 3, because of 3 reasons: Andrew Garfield's attempts to save this movie, Emma Stone's attempts to save this movie and the chemistry between these 2 people whose attempts tried to save the movie. Dane De Haan tried hard too, but never convinced... It's also true failure to have Jamie Fox in your cast and use him so badly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie made me want to never see Spiderman again. Perhaps Marvel has something better to offer. It's a shame to make this idolized superhero a joke. I just hope it doesn't destroy the careers of those involved. <br/><br/>Man, the casting must hate the movie more than I do by now."

","Toby McGuire will always be Spiderman. I wasn't expecting much since I didn't think the last Spiderman was very good and I got about what I expected. And this time, I thought the special effects weren't even that good because it was just too cartoony looking. With all the Matrix slow-mo and Spidy dodging bullets and flying around, it just looked more like animation.<br/><br/>In this sequel, Spiderman faces Electro and the Green Goblin yet again. One thing, they could have had anyone play Electro because most of his screen time is when he's been transformed and blue and not even looking like a real person. No need to give Jamie Foxx a big pay check. And could they have had anymore ridiculous, fake looking electric eels.<br/><br/>And about half the film is Peter and Gwen's ""sticky"" relationship situation. It just makes for a boring storyline. Also Electro has no real motivation for hating Spiderman other than Spidy forgot his name. Just silly. At least Harry got a good costume for the Goblin this time.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Don't pay to watch this. I saw it on cable. I think it is only good for background noise. I wouldn't recommend anyone run out to see it."

","I grew up reading some of the 90's Spider-Man comics, not the ""Ultimate"" versions, so my knowledge of the sagas might not be the same as the target audience for this movie. I've seen Raimi's trilogy as well and what I can say is that in the end it all comes down to this: if you're older than the expected target audience for this movie you'll probably prefer Raimi's interpretation. Both trilogies have their pros and cons. Personally I think the shy and dorky Peter Parker version of the Raimi trilogy fits the character much better than the ""Amazing"" version with the modern and outgoing Peter Parker.<br/><br/>The movie was a CGI fest but they went too far with the whole background story about Parker's parents and while you can feel that Peter and Gwen's relationship had more chemistry than the Maguire-Dunst duo (after all Garfield and Emma are together IRL) it gets a bit repetitive after a while. In terms of acting the tension of Peter's struggle between his life vs his responsibilities as Spider-Man was better achieved in Raimi's trilogy as well, here you just don't feel that empathy for the character. The dubious script also brings up some questions concerning Peter's life, e.g. how could he be thinking about going to England with Gwen when he could barely afford college at the time??<br/><br/>Then there's the villains. Electro's story was lame to say the least and being played by an African-American actor was not faithful to the comics. Harry's brief appearance wasn't satisfying and his story was filled with inconsistencies as well, e.g. if he was sent to a boarding school at a very young age and Peter was left with his uncle and aunt and then went to the ""regular"" high school how could they know each other? It would be highly improbable. His fight with Spidey was too short, not to mention that in the comics Gwen was killed by his father. <br/><br/>The writers and producers should have understood by now that putting more than a villain in a movie is a blockbuster suicide, that was one of the Spider-Man 3 flaws and it seems they still didn't get it. The fact that they made the villains all come out from Oscorp Industries was also one of the points I didn't like. Hats off however for Gwen's death scene, where Garfield performed much better. The jokes were typical Spider-Man as usual but never match the Raimi's trilogy (in the 2 first movies at least...). All in all, another sequel that fails to beat the first movie of a trilogy."

At one point, another villain actually called him his 'fairy godmother'(!)<br/><br/>The script wasn't rubbish but it needed editing. Instead, every single idea, line and scenario suggested during development was included in this ridiculously overlong film.<br/><br/>The only saving grace was the action but that got extremely boring because it kicked in from the very beginning so there was no room for progression. It's like Hollywood just said: cute kid, love stuff, action scenes every 5 minutes, a few bad guys (one black/blue) and we'll make a few hundred million.<br/><br/>I'm not impressed. I've already forgotten half of the film (the rest will be gone by morning).<br/><br/>Tangent-rant: What is the point of a Spider-Man who cannot shoot webs out of his wrists (or body in general)? Without that ability, any villain could create that technology and Spider-Man would no longer be unique. This Spider-Man only has strength, speed and sticky feet. That does not a Spider-Man make I'm afraid. The only justification for the name Spider-Man is having some spider-specific feature built in which he currently does not have.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone obviously had fun together but I only saw the spark between 'them' and not between their characters. This might be because Andrew Garfield has zero screen presence.<br/><br/>I don't think it's worth more than a 5 but the effects were great and I wasn't totally bored throughout so I'll give it an extra point.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The Amazing Spiderman 2 contained some really good elements such as chemistry between characters. Andrew Garfield returns to play Peter Parker and in my opinion he is still the best Spiderman to be put on screen yet. Despite being 30 when they shot this on the whole he captures all the mannerisms of Peter Parker, like his new fond confidence after starting to get used to his powers. This film also showcased his science brain something that was not illustrated in the Raimi movies. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy had great chemistry with Garfield and it made the movie a lot more humane. Jamie Foxx as Electro was a good fit and he got a tad more character to him than Dr. Conners in the last film. My favourite parts of the movie was when Spiderman was just swinging and free falling around the city. The cinematography was amazing in this instance. Dane Dehaan was great as Harry Osborn but his friendship with Peter didn't have time to prosper thus meaning the Green Goblin was wasted too by being shoehorned into the film just to kill Gwen and set up for Sinister Six.The Rhino was in the movie even less than the Goblin meaning the movie was crowded not by villains but by needless sub plots. In the end the Amazing Spiderman 2 wasn't better than the first one as it was sloppy and overcrowded. The villains were wasted on the whole and the back and forth love story could have been condensed. I would still recommend it but a chance missed here i think."

A geek boy who leads a double life as Spiderman , a web slinging , roof top bounding crime fighter with special powers who takes on villains who use their own special powers as a force of evil . Because of my own familiarity of the backstory and premise I didn't bother wasting my time watching THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN from a couple of years ago since I'd already seen the trilogy by Sam Raimi a few years earlier so didn't want to watch a film whose runtime is going to be going over old ground and only watched this sequel because of a chance to watch a recent blockbuster for free <br/><br/>There's not a lot here that can be called groundbreaking or original but for what it is - a big budget Summer blockbuster - it functions very well . I do consider Sam Raimi as being one of the most underrated directors in the last couple of decades and while Marc Webb might be an inferior director at least Webb knows how to make a marketable Summer film . I definitely found Andrew Garfield a more impressionable Peter Parker/ Spiderman than Toby MaGuire . Garfield job is made easier by having his Spiderman make wisecracks which never becomes as silly as it could have been . Garfield's smouldering good looks and his character interaction with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey is obviously produced to rope in the TWILIGHT demographic but I thought this aspect worked fairly well . It was also nice to see Peter Parker/Spiderman have Harry Osborn / The Green Goblin as an equal of sorts . The downside is that Jamie Foxx Electro seems shoehorned in as a subsidiary villain , and at the end of the day THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is nothing more than a big budget superhero blockbuster though it's a superior and likable one"

","First of all the visual effects of this film are incredible, as a spider-man fan to see spider-man swing around the city like in this movie is extremely pleasing. The second thing I love is the cast. Andrew Garfield is perfect as Spider-man/Peter Parker.In the first TASM he captured the nerdy and socially awkward side of Peter whilst also capturing the funny side of Spider-Man.In this film he shows character growth, now he is not as socially awkward because hes outside of high school whilst still being nerdy and of course Emma stone and Garfield's chemistry on screen is the heart of the movie which Marc Webb portrays so well.Dane Dehann also manages to make Harry's character more interesting by bringing a creepy element to him, even though his arc to becoming the Green Goblin was a little rushed the way he played Green Goblin was extremely scary and unsettling.The only character I had a problem with is Max Dillon, for me his motivations weren't very clear and the overall look of the character (comb-over,spaced teeth) put me of from taking the character seriously. However Electro does everything a villain should do, he was scary and menacing especially in that scene with the German Doctor also the look of the character and the CGI work made the character incredibly interesting to look at.What I was most anxious about was the increased amount of characters and plot points, what I was very surprised at is that it manages it all very well , even though there are moments where it feels we've went from relationship issues to dying dad to parent issues to Max Dillon talking to himself.Overall it works very well and manages not to be Spider-man 3. So overall this film has amazing visual effects, incredible performances from most characters, whilst having minor issues with some and even though it has allot going on it manages to handle it very well. I would definitely recommend this film."

The end was absolutely heartbreaking really broke me I ended up crying my eyes out in the pictures. The film really grabbed me considering awkwardly I hadn't saw the first one so I didn't really understand why Toby Maguires suddenly was replaced by Andrew Garfield as Spider Man. Anyway I enjoyed his film it was okay and had a good plot I've always been a fan off spider man anyway him being one of my favourite super heroes so yes this film did live up to the standards of heroes."
"MoviesReviews101","7","0","2","8 November 2014"," Verdict: Spider-Man Growing Up
","Story: This follows up from the first one so we have to remember unlike the Avengers and Dark Knight we are dealing with a teenage superhero. He has different problems like whether he wants a girlfriend or whether to go to college, you know the serious stuff. We have him putting out all the cheesy lines against the person he fights not taking anything seriously. While Peter is trying to figure out what his life holds next, the people against him start their own stories. We have the generic loner scientist who ends up having an accident, gaining powers and using them for evil, been there seen that in every Spider-man film. We also have the Harry Osborn who wants Spider-Man's blood to cure his sickness and when he can't have it he goes on a rampage against Spider-Man. It would be fair this is a slow moving film and it really is building up for the next chapter. (7/10)<br/><br/>Actor Review<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield: Spider-Man/Peter Parker while trying to figure out what to do with his life he carries on fighting crime, he has to decide whether to keep with his girlfriend when her father's dying wish was to leave her so she couldn't get caught up in trouble. He does ends up having to face the biggest battle of his life after his battles with Electro and Green Goblin. Good performance in a character that develops as the film unfolds. (8/10)<br/><br/>Emma Stone: Gwen Stacy ambitious girlfriend of Peter, who wants to excel in her studies and gets that chance to but with Peter in her life she will always be in danger. Good supporting performance, but I always find relationships for superheroes only get in the way and annoy. (7/10)<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx: Electro lonely scientist who has helped the city design a better power source. He feels like everyone is against him but when Spider-Man saves him he gets a boost of confidence. Just when things look good for Max he ends up having an accident at work and turning into Electro, who starts off just wanting help but when he feels betrayed by Spider-Man he wants to take out the web-slinger and the city. Good performance playing a very difficult character that really looks the part. (8/10)<br/><br/>Dane DeHaan: Green Goblin/Harry Osborn an old friend of Peter who wants him to find Spider-Man so he can use his blood to cure his terminal illness. After both Peter and Spider-Man refuse for safety reason he finds out his company secretly has some stored away and he uses it and becomes the Green Goblin out to stop Spider-Man. Good performance from the always solid Dane. (8/10)<br/><br/>Director Review: Marc Webb – Great direction creating a story that really is building to something bigger, creating some very memorable fight scenes and a villain in Electro like nothing we have seen before. (8/10)<br/><br/>Action: When the action happens it is all very good, with some great camera spinning shots of Spider-Man in battle. (8/10) Superhero: A solid entry in the superhero genre. (8/10) Settings: New York makes a great setting because without all the building Spider-Man couldn't swing as much. (9/10) Special Effects: Great special effects used throughout the film. (10/10) Suggestion: This must be watch by all the superhero fans out there, it is creating a big picture without having to use separate films to add to one of franchise. (Superhero Fans Watch) <br/><br/>Best Part: Spider-Man battles Electro round two. Worst Part: It does start slow, nearly an hour before we meet Electro. Action Scene Of The Film: The final battles Believability: No (0/10) Chances of Tears: No (0/10) Chances of Sequel: Has one planned Post Credits Scene: No<br/><br/>Oscar Chances: No Box Office: $708 Million Budget: $200 Million Runtime: 2 Hours 22 Minutes Tagline: His greatest battle begins<br/><br/>Overall: Solid Addition to Spider-Man Franchise<br/><br/>Check out more reviews at http://moviesreview101.com/"
"heisenberg_collier","7","0","2","6 October 2014"," Definitely did NOT live up to the hype.
","Amazing Spider 2 really did disappoint me, I will divide this review into two sections: Pro and Con.<br/><br/>Pros: The visual effects in this film were stunning as well as the screenplay, the great effects really made this movie 'pop'. The acting in this film was good, especially with Andrew Garfield considering he's a 30 year old actor he made you believe that he was a graduating high school student, he had so much fun with his role and Emma Stone played a great character that I enjoyed watching very much. I was happy that took a step away from that dark tone that the movie crew tried achieve in the first one, Spidey definitely belongs in this type of upbeat environment.<br/><br/>That's pretty much it for pros of the film. Yeah, not much.<br/><br/>Cons: Everyone gave the 2007 Spider Man 3 so much crap for having a clunky and lazily written plot but that's exactly what we got from this 2nd installment, just a horribly written plot, this movie tries to introduce so many characters that it completely prevents us from getting a better reboot. First we're introduced to Rhino, then Electro then Green Goblin AND you STILL have to sit through Peter's parents story which I personally didn't care for. The music in this was awful, we got some horrible dubstep combined with Hans Zimmer and those two do not mix well at all. Character development was very poor with a lot of the characters especially Electro's unjustified hate for Spider Man,at first he adored Spidey but then he gets into a brawl with him for being 'selfish' seriously for a guy that intelligent you'd think that he would have more sense than to assume that Spidey is selfish for being shown on times square screens. The costume choice for the Green Goblin was awful, but that doesn't make the movie any less good.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film for the most part don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely enjoyable for a good 'turn off your brain summer movie"" I was hoping to get a better movie bet hey you have to review what you get, not what you want."
"rachtels-731-540044","4","0","3","25 September 2014"," Good start but drops off
","Dad: The first Amazing Spiderman was very good and my son and I were looking forward to watching the sequel. We liked the characters, acting and special effects but the plot disappointed. It started strong and the first half was really good, but it went downhill fast when Harry wanted Spidermans' blood. It was disturbing that Gwen had to get killed. This is supposed to be a movie for kids age 13 but I think it is senseless that they can't make a movie anymore in which a loved one doesn't die. Ever since Bambi this seems to be a must. This movie is no exception and of course they have to show how the parents get killed. Maybe we need to go back to Dora and the Wiggles. ;-)<br/><br/>Son: I totally agree with my dad on the parents dieing,remember the flashback in the beginning of the first well its in this one and this time they show the plane crash (in the plane crash peters mom is shot)and his dad gets beat up over a computer program. In the end of this movie peter quits after Gwen dies. In the end he comes back though."
"darth_timon","8","0","1","19 September 2014"," A Balanced Film
","Whereas the era of Toby Maguire's Spiderman was marked by a Peter Parker wound up tighter than a coiled spring and on the verge of tears on several occasions, Garfield's Spiderman is more at ease with himself, and certainly more street-wise. He is tougher in some respects, but also more likable as a character, which shines through quite a lot for me in this film.<br/><br/>The almost-forced love story between Parker and Mary-Jane in the first three Spiderman films is replaced by a more natural, gentle portrayal, and the on-screen chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma is better than that between Maquire and Kirsten Dunst. <br/><br/>The primary villain of the piece, Electro, is well-performed by Jamie Foxx but the character is a little clichéd and to be honest, doesn't get enough screen time either. I rather liked the new spin on Harry Osborn, who, like Parker, is less of an emotional wreck and, despite some acts of petulance, is more likable than James Franco's interpretation. His transition into the Goblin is motivated more out of desperation than anything else, so he garners more sympathy than before.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well staged and manage to convey a strong sense of excitement and tension. All in all, I would rate this film quite highly!"
"iamelte","6","0","3","19 September 2014"," A good effort with some drawbacks
","What TASM2 does well that previous instalments didn't is create a believable connection between Peter and his love interest, which is deepened emotionally throughout this film. As such the ending is able to achieve a tragic climax. The problems this film has however is not it's abundance of plot lines and characters, but its execution of them. The relationship between Peter and Harry is only slightly explored and his descent into the character of the Green Goblin is distracted by Electro's involvement in the film. As such Harry's transformation into the Goblin is very sudden so it's intensity is subsequently not explored as well as it could have been if he had been the only antagonist in the movie. His screen time as the Goblin is effective and his lunacy and desperation is captured, but the fight between him and Spiderman lasts around 3 minutes so does not serve as a satisfying enough confrontation. It almost appears as though the character was added at the last minute to create a fruitful cast, but it just distorts and distracts the focus of the story. Another weakness is the Film's blend of humour and maturity, as such it appears comic in some areas but serious in others and for some reason it does not feel compatible as the viewers emotions are likely to fluctuates too much, making the more intense set pieces in the film suffer as they will not be interpreted with the right state of mind.<br/><br/>Overall the film contains some competent special effects and strong action set pieces, brief some of them may be, and it's character development in terms of Peter and Gwen is strong, but not so much with the other characters involved in this muddled film that cannot quite decide it's attitude regarding itself."
"leonblackwood","5","0","3","14 September 2014"," Expected Better! 5/10
","Review: I know that I might be the only one that thinks this, but I didn't really enjoy this film. It's not as good as the original Spider-Man movies, which had great action throughout, and the storyline was a bit weak. Electro was hardly in the movie and the showdown wasn't that great. As for the other baddies, they weren't that brilliant either and none of them was close to the amazing fight on the train with Doc Ock. The CGI was quite good and Spider- man looked pretty real when he was jumping from building to building but that was about it. I wasn't that impressed with the first one and this one just follows suit. They need to bring in some decent baddies with a decent storyline because I expected much better from this reboot. Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Jamie Foxx was pretty poor in this film, but I don't blame him. The geeky character really didn't suit him and the haircut was bloody ridiculous. Personally, I think that the main problem with the film is that there is too many things going on at once. You have this love story which becomes a bit tedious after a while, and then you've got a geeky scientist that falls in a pool of electric eels and becomes Electro and you've got another story about a teenager whose dying and needs Spider-Man's blood to survive. On top of that Spider- Man is saving the world and trying to find out what happened with his parents so the whole thing is all over the place. On the plus side, I didn't fall asleep through the epic movie and the attention to detail was quite good but I hope that the next instalment has some more action and less chatting.<br/><br/>Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $708.3million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the Spider-Man franchise. 5/10"
"destroyerwod","6","0","3","29 August 2014"," What did i just watched? Oh Boy !!!
","Now don't get me wrong, the Peter Parker/Spider-man and Gwen Stacy characters are done fine. Even Electro is OK as a villain. But what they did with the rest??? They spend all the movie build the Green Goblin for what? 3 minutes of screen time? WTF. I already heard the Rhyno was more or less just a cameo.. And ""poop"" yeah he was... not even a complete battle wow... But Green Goblin appear on screen for a couple minutes, thats it... he is so lame... I was so disappointed when i saw this...<br/><br/>Yes yes, maybe they want to keep him for a sequel... maybe. And yes they did show the tentacles and all.. so there still lots of potential for this series. But really the way Harry Osbourn aka Green Goblin(by the way he is never called that) is handled is crap... plain and simple.<br/><br/>Of course when there was a pretty good trilogy before you tend to compare... and compared to the first trilogy so far this one ain't winning... 2 vs 2 is superior to the first trilogy easily...<br/><br/>Its just... you don't relay the Goblin to a second zone ""poopy"" villain... hell even Harry as the Goblin in Spider-Man 3 had more of a role and a better story... !!! I feel they try to ""dark knight"" this series too much and they can't even match Nolan's work... not remotely...<br/><br/>So yeah some stuff was entertaining, and Andrew Garfield do a good job as Spider-Man... but the rest feel just SOOO OFFF<br/><br/>PS : Yes i used ""poop"" because for some strange reason the board don't let me post the real word."
"TxMike","Null","0","3","24 August 2014"," Another installment, mostly 'ho-hum' for me.
","I suppose I am too old, seeing all the various incarnations of Spiderman and wondering if they will ever let it rest. Not likely.<br/><br/>I saw the 'Amazing Spider Man' almost 2 years ago and enjoyed it enough. Frankly I don't think Garfield's interpretation is as genuine as Toby Maguire's was. He's good enough in most ways but for some reason he seems too goofy at times. I didn't find it as fitting for the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Yes, Andrew Garfield is back as Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Also Emma Stone is back as Gwen Stacy, who in the movie preceding this learned of Spidey's identity. (As an aside Garfield and Stone became a couple during the making of the first film and are presumably still.) <br/><br/>This episode introduces a new character, Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon, electrical engineer who, via an industrial accident, getting a high voltage then falling into a vat of electric eels, becomes Electro. At first he just wants to be helpful but is turned to the dark side and Spider Man has to figure out a way to defeat him.<br/><br/>Lots and lots of CGI and the acting between Stone and Garfield is just so-so. While most of it is enjoyable and entertaining to watch, I consider it a second-rate Spider Man movie overall."
"diomavro","6","0","2","2 August 2014"," I am so frustrated by this movie!
","One one hand I want to say this is the best spider-man movie ever. That is because I feel like it get's the Spiderman feel better than any other movie. The previous (non-amazing) Spiderman movies were a little bit of a disappointment to me because it really didn't feel like Spiderman was anything special as a super hero as his main feat was web shooting and strength, whilst in the new spiderman movies you really do feel his agility coming through, he seems to really rely more on his senses which makes for a much more fluid spiderman experience in my view.<br/><br/>On the other hand I am frustrated with how terrible other aspects of this movie are, if development is to be done on the protagonists family it should be done in the first movie because at this point we have lost interest in the past and we look more to the future. I think the acting was all around bad, except for Garfield who is the better Spiderman. The plots going around were a little bit pointless, such as aunt may working at the hospital to pay for his college tuition... but there was no conclusion to that at all, we don't even know if he is going to college, at some point he was going to run to England to be do his spidey thing there but that was cancelled, and there is no resolution at the end whether they have problems any more.<br/><br/>Back on the positive side I must say that the story didn't progress in the exact form I thought it would, mostly because I imagined the villains would be more challenging but more importantly, I did not see Gwen's death coming which is always nice, one of my main marks of a good story is its unpredictability(regardless of knowing how it will end).<br/><br/>The villain, I thought electrode obviously had psychological issues but perhaps a little more screen time on him before he became electrode would have made his madness abit clearer since it can just seem like he is randomly loving and hating spider-man. The green goblin stuff was a little rushed but its probably just because they are setting up for the next movie. <br/><br/>The non-spidey script could have been better and the camera work could also have been a little less random...<br/><br/>Overall though because of how great the spidey scenes are(not necessarily the special/visual effects) I still think this is a good movie."

Why is he a robot, what happened to half man/half rhino like the games or comics. Also i do not like the machine guns attached to his robot suit or the missile launchers either.

"MacTheMovieguy","7","0","2","23 July 2014"," It's an improvement on the first Amazing Spider-Man, for sure, but it has hits and misses.
","The thing I learned today is that there are a lot more Spider-Man comic book fans than I would have thought, and there are still some who are oblivious to comic books. There was an audible gasp when Felicity Jones revealed her character's name was Felicia. As in Felicia Hardy, aka Black Cat. No, they don't go anywhere with that. Nor do they go anywhere with Alistair Smythe. But people definitely appreciated the Black Cat name drop.<br/><br/>An equal amount of people were audibly shocked at the death in the film. You know the death. If you don't know the death, I won't 100% spoil it for you, but it's a big death in the comic book franchise repeated here on the screen. Shot almost exactly how it happened in the comic book, it is a powerful moment. And there were audible gasps, and at least one person crying.<br/><br/>The film spends a ton of time on the mysterious deaths of Ma and Pa Parker, and just why they died, and what they had discovered. The mystery isn't 100% revealed, obviously because they knew they were going to do a third film. Another sign of them doing a third film, is that the film ends with a climatic battle between Rhino and Spidey, suggesting more like Rhino are coming (like Vulture, for instance). And at least one of the two MAIN villains (Electro/Green Goblin) is still alive for a reprise in the third film.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a more appropriate Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire. He really embraces the humor of Spidey. However, I think Tobey was a better Peter Parker (except for Emo Parker in the third film). Emma Stone is a great alpha female, taking ownership of her own need to do the right thing, and perform a great act of heroism. She has a speech at the beginning of the film that basically foreshadows the whole film though. Bad form.<br/><br/>Special effects? Oh yeah. The Electro effects are super cool. He glows the whole film, and the electricity looks great shooting from him. It's really well done, really realistic. He doesn't ever look CGI'd at all. I could have done without the bizarre makeup on Goblin, which seems to be easily curable by the end of the film. Don't transform him into Yoda, and then just create a cure out of thin air.<br/><br/>It's an improvement on the first Amazing Spider-Man, for sure, but it has hits and misses. Rhino is basically a waste of time, and Paul Giamatti. I get that you're setting up a third film, but Dane DeHaan needed more screen time to make Harry not look like a psychotic emo rich kid. Special Effects on Electro= Good. Makeup Effects On Goblin= Bad. The Rhino Suit? Silly. Emma Stone? Fantastic. Overall plot structure? Pretty good."
"swellframe17","5","0","3","2 July 2014"," A sequel that doesn't live up to the first one.
","2 1/2 out of 4 stars.<br/><br/>Marc Webb's 2014 film ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is your average Blockbuster film that doesn't build very well on its first film. I was excited for this film after watching Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" I thought Andrew Garfield did a really good job playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man and bringing much more emotion to the role. However, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" just makes things bigger and hopes that it will be better.<br/><br/>I will admit, the visual effects are cool and seeing shots from Spider-Man's perspective are impressive, but it doesn't hold up for a film that's almost 2 1/2 hours. The storyline for the film is also weak. We're told things before we really need to know them (like in the opening scene) and there are too many villains (just like Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3). There is Paul Giamatti's Rhino (who doesn't get much screen time), Jamie Foxx's Electro (who gets the cheesiest lines), and Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (who could've been a much more effective villain if he was given more screen time). All these villains become more one-dimensional. If they just picked one, I think the film would've been better and the villain could feel much more real. <br/><br/>Luckily, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (playing Gwen Stacy) have great chemistry and bring life to a film filled with too many visual effects. Sally Field is also effective as Aunt May. The film has interesting themes of life, death, pain, and what it means to be a hero, but none of them feel complete by the end. Peter Parker deals with these heavy themes, but it's not reflected in his Spider-Man identity. <br/><br/>If I didn't like the first film as much as I did, I probably would've given this movie a lower rating. There are more Spider-Man films to come and I hope that the filmmakers can learn from the mistakes in this film to give Spider-Man a film he deserves."
"george59883-36-312142","7","0","3","24 June 2014"," Not the Worst Spider-Man
","This film, like Spider-Man 3, is trying to hard. It has so many plot threads and so many characters and some of them get the shaft. This to me though, feels like a great romantic comedy with superheroes. The love between Emma and Andrew is so real. I mean, it is obvious real, but their connection in the film feels genuine and you can completely tell why they can't see a world without the other. Their dialogue is so good and you can clearly tell that some it is ad libed. Andrew Garfield, to me at least, is the quintessential Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He is a character who not only enjoys Spider-Man, but also who is saying fun quips at the same time. Andrew is such a good performer and just owns the role without ever trying to hard. It is a great performance. Emma also doesn't overplay Gwen at all. She could just be the silly girlfriend following him around thinking she is better than she is, but she also feels like a real person. She is just so good in her role. Dane DeHaan is also amazing, no pun intended, in his role as Harry Osborn. He has these great nuances of a villain character that just work for me and he is my favorite villain in this film because I don't believe his character gets over played as much as the other two. You can feel his true anger and sadness and you really see how he was a perfect fit for this character. The dialogue between him and Peter is so good that you can see that they actually were friends and it really could have been done so badly if not for someone like Marc Webb behind the camera. You also have this great relationship between Aunt May and Peter that is so good that you feel touched. You can tell that they are family and that they truly do love each other and each scene they have on screen together is so well done. Sally Field is so talented and she takes every scene she gets and really gives a really heartwarming performance.<br/><br/>I do believe that some of the performances are dull. Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon or Electro is just to hammy. He doesn't come off real enough to be an actual character and being the one that is technically the main villain seems like a waste. You also have Paul Giamatti as The Rhino who is so much more hammier than Electro. He has this very thick Russian accent and his dialogue is so bad that you can't take anything he does seriously. His scenes are played up for comedy, but I don't find them funny at all. Chris Cooper also has a minor part in this film and his scene with Harry is so well done that I did enjoy it. It isn't just I hate you. You hate me. We are a unhappy family. You really see the depths of this relationship and it really can tell you something about Norman and Harry's relationship. Campbell Scott plays Richard Parker and definitely is the parent that has the most inspiration towards Peter in this film. You can really tell the love he has for Parker in his few moments that it is so sad when we find out his inevitable end in this film. What this film does though to his character is really so real and I love it to the end.<br/><br/>With a Superhero film, you obviously want some spectacular, no pun intended, action scenes and I believe this film delivers. While the first didn't have any action scenes that really stood out, this film does have some really good action scenes that stick with you. Electro has such a cool power set and they use that to their advantage. You get some really amazing, no pun intended, effects that showcase the powers of both Spider-Man and Electro. I think that the fight with Harry is very lack luster, but has its effect on you. The special effects are top notch. Spider-Man has a weight to him in this film and you feel like Andrew Garfield might actually be in the suit while he is swinging around in New York. I do think that it feels like Electro sometimes feels like Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen, but it didn't bother me that much. Even with lackluster characters from the villains, you still had some great actions scenes come about. And another conflicting point is the music. Some of it is really well integrated into the film and sounds very good while other pieces of music aren't integrated well and threw me off. I thought that the Electro theme sounded very good, but sometimes it became a forefront to the scene and I didn't enjoy then. I feel that it is groundbreaking like Hans Zimmer likes to do, but sometimes it sounds awkward and takes me out of the film.<br/><br/>The problems do arise from this film's jumbled plot. This film really is a great romantic comedy at its center. But then it moves to a new development for the villains and it doesn't give them really any time to develop a character so they just really become cardboard cut outs. The film does have some really good connections and, at its center, a really good love story, but all that levity is wasted with some very undeveloped villains that boil down to CGI tricks and some awkward music. This isn't a bad film. Just a disappointing film for someone who wanted it to be just as good and if not better than the first film. I give this film 2.75 out of 4 stars."

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a sequel to the 2012 film of the same name and stars Andrew Garfield as the web-slinger who fights crime in New York City. This time Peter finds out more about his parents who we see in the opening credits and they are fighting some guy on an aeroplane who was posing as a pilot. We then meet Spiderman himself trying to get some Russian guy played by Paul Giamatti(who will be later known as Rhino a villain Spiderman defeats but you have to wait till the end to see him)and Peter as Spiderman is out to get him by teasing with him. But Peter is late for his graduation so he ditches Giamatti's charcther and goes to graduate along with Gwen Stacy(played by Garfield's real life girlfriend Emma Stone) who have an off/on again relationship and Peter still thinks of Gwen's father (Denis Leary)who died in the first Spiderman movie and he can't stop thinking of him,especially during the graduation scene,so he decides to break up with Gwen again but she is so stubborn she won't accept it as she says to him you have done this to me again and again and again. Later we meet a man called Max Dillion(played by former singer turned actor Jamie Foxx)who is obsessed with Spiderman,but when an accident at work causes him to turn bad he ends up being ANOTHER villain that Spiderman has to defeat called Electro who can control the electricity.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Peter's former buddy Harry Osbourne(played by Dane DeHaan who reminds me of a younger version of Leonardo Di Caprio)'s father passes away and Harry has some sort of disease that turns him into the Green Goblin as his father apparently had this disease,and the only way to cure it is Spiderman's blood. <br/><br/>Now I don't want to give too much away but you can tell what is gonna happen next. Overall I enjoyed this movie, in fact I was watching it on DVD as I got the DVD of it and quite frankly like I said before its better than the first movie. So is it as good as Tobey Maguire's version? well I think Andrew Garfield was very good in this movie especially this one part where a certain charcther that we love dies and I was in tears because of it(happens during the climax scene).But is it better than Spiderman 3 which had the same setup with 3 villains.......YES I really loved this movie,in fact I know its a guys film but who cares I grew up with Spiderman and I think his an awesome superhero.<br/><br/>I didn't get the chance to see this in the cinemas but I was lucky to have watched it online.<br/><br/>Verdict: The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a very good movie that will leave you tear eyed in the end for 2 hours and 16 minutes its worth seeing for the effects and the climax scene.<br/><br/>Overall its a 7.5/10."

","As a kid, I grew loving the spider-man movies. They were so awesome and enjoyable. Of course, seeing this movie I wasn't surprised. I was in the cinema with my friend and through the whole movie, all I wanted to know was when it was going to finish. The first Amazing Spider-man was as boring as hell and I stopped watching it at about half way not and even caring what would happen at the end. Seeing this movie, it really made me hate The Amazing Spider-man and I don't think there is a point in making them. The last Spider-man was in 2007 and it should've stayed that way. I really hate how they have to make these little extra advanced marvel characters so that they can get more money because they couldn't think of their own movie to create. If you're a big a spider-man fan, I wouldn't recommend the Amazing Spider-man, they are both boring and there is hardly any action in it."

","I can't believe I waited this long to watch a superhero movie. I missed watching the first Spiderman reboot in the theaters so I thought that I would give the 2nd one a try, and the movie left me conflicted.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the good parts. - I like Garfield's Spiderman way more than Tobey Maguire because the character is supposed to be funny. The one-liners and jokes are spot-on and instead of a buff dude, we have a nimble skinny guy, just like in the comics. I also like the new costume, a big improvement from the first, even better than the Raimi Spiderman. He also does waaay better action as compared to the first reboot.<br/><br/>Also, you get to see Spidey interact with the citizens in New York, and he is... well, friendly. Maguire didn't really do that much talking with everyone else. ALSO, less emotional outbreaks from Peter Parker, and less stuttering (doesn't mean they aren't there tho).<br/><br/><ul><li>Gwen Stacy is also a big improvement from MJ in the first films because instead of being rescued constantly, she actually HELPS. A pretty face is not everything, girls.</li></ul><br/><br/>... and that's all I can think about for now<br/><br/>Now with the gripes: - Electro was not a well-written character. Before the powers he was a cartoon-like obsession with Spiderman, and after his accident he suddenly hates him? And his motives are confusing. Why does he suddenly have an attention disorder? Why does he suddenly want all the power in the city so he can be a ""god""? Ugh, Jamie Foxx deserves better.<br/><br/><ul><li>At some point you feel like Electro is Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen. He's bald and all blue, he can teleport, and the explosion in Times Square looked like the explosion in Watchmen. Hmm.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Everyone laughs so hard at things that are hardly funny in a conversation (particularly Peter x Gwen and Peter x Harry). Peter was like a nervous girl trying to get Harry to sleep with him by laughing at everything he said. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Peter and Gwen scenes are still annoying. I love Emma Stone and I think Andrew Garfield is awesome, but whenever they talk to each other, you just reeeaaaally want it to be over. They have chemistry, but it doesn't make you want to watch them... like an annoying hipster couple. </li></ul><br/><br/>the only time where you actually feel for them is when Gwen dies, and that feeling of sadness is just because nobody wants to see Emma Stone die. What kind of sick bastard would wish to deprive the world of Emma Stone?<br/><br/><ul><li>Rhino is too heavily advertised for the movie, but he is really just a cameo. Fans would have been more satisfied if they had no idea he would be making an appearance, instead of expecting him to be a main part and wondering the entire time where the heck Paul Giamatti was. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Green Goblin is confusing. First he just wants to live/survive his disease, By the end, he wants to ruin Peter Parker (or world domination, whatever villains want). He doesn't want revenge for the people who took over his company. He just wants to f*ck shiz up. Sure, him assembling The Sinister Six at the end would be awesome, but I would have wanted it to be written better.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>so much talking. The action is not well-spread throughout the movie. At some point you forget that Peter Parker was Spiderman.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's just not iconic enough. You compare it to the Sam Raimi films and you just wouldn't get the same feeling. I don't know if the word is ""forgettable"" but it's something at those lines.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I don't think the soundtrack helped. So much hipstery music. You wouldn't get any of that in a Marvel Studios movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>To sum it all up, it was an improvement from the first reboot, but not as good as the Raimi films (except 3. 3 does not count). I would rather just replace the director (and maybe a different writer).They already got the right Spiderman. They just need to put him in the right film.<br/><br/>7.0 flat/10"

","Entertaining? sure. I wouldn't pay money at a theatre to see it tho.<br/><br/>I still don't understand Jamie Foxx's role in this movie; completely rushed and undetermined. There is a serious correlation between his character and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze in the old George Clooney Batman movie. The villain in this movie was seriously underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Being an admirer of the the Amazing Spiderman, I was hoping the same movie elements would exist, and they did...but not without the pitfalls. Sequels always have a way of falling flat.<br/><br/>I will give a nod to the indie shot in the bedroom scene. This movie, cinematography-ly speaking is all over the friggin map. You got awesome cgi, hand-held prosumer DSLR's, super syncopated slo-mo and Paul Giamatti talking in a terrible Russian accent in a full metal rhinoceros body suit - that is no lie my fellow IMDb friends. <br/><br/>Spiderman really needs a new story, one that audience haven't seen before and this movie is all the same ole same ole with a bit of a better ending. Save your money and watch it on DVD or rental or however you do it now."

","The sequel to the 2012 reboot of the Spider-Man series may not be as great as the previous installment in the series but is worth a watch. There are some good moments but some are not. If you are still yet to see this flick then please do not read this as this contains spoilers.<br/><br/>It starts with Peter continuing his Spider-Man job as well as his aspiring intern job as a photographer. He is now graduated and has trouble with maintaining his relationship with Gwen Stacy because of something going in his mind. But then enters Max Dhillon who's life changes because of Spider-Man. And now we see a young boy coming out of a luxurious car and entering a big house. We see a old guy on his death bed. Since then the winds start changing as Peter meets his old friend. <br/><br/>Then Electro rises. Peter is at crossroads and the only person who can save him is his father. All this is shown pretty nicely but too many unnecessary and rather clumsy sub- plots enter the picture which makes the movie even less gripping. But then Harry starts deceasing similarly like his father. Now the Spidey lovers get want they want. All this makes the movie more interesting.<br/><br/>The movie has some really good moments but some non-gripping times makes the narrative pretty dizzy. Although the sparks between Peter and Gwen saves the day with help of Jamie Foxx's and Dehaan's excellent acting. The narrative is slow but gripping as Peter's past, present and future comes together. Marc Webb should be given some credit for continuing the Spidey saga well. It is a good movie but falls short of being a masterpiece. Now it is your turn to watch it."
"michaelward291-17-433659","5","0","3","2 June 2014"," Very disappointing, slightly better than the first.
","The only reason I have given this movie a 6 is due to Andrew Garfield's amazing performance as spiderman and the good CGI scenes. Apart from that, the Amazing spiderman was a big disappointment, and I would have rated this movie a 5 if I didn't like Andrew Garfield.<br/><br/>The trailer made this movie look great, showing the multiple enemies which I was looking forward to. But when I watched the movie, what an absolute disappointment. The rhino appeared for about 2 minutes, then the green goblin appeared for about 5 minutes, maybe a tiny bit longer. It seemed very rushed trying to cramp all the enemies. Also, it took roughly 40 minutes to see electro. The other 40 minutes you can miss, nothing important. <br/><br/>However, Andrew Garfield's performance as spiderman is great. He is really good just like Tobey maguire, if not I prefer Andrew Garfield. <br/><br/>The fighting scenes of spiderman and electro were very impressive, but this was probably the only part of the movie that kept me hooked. Apart from that the rest of the movie was boring. The movie tried to make this richard parker plot thing interesting but they were just trying to force it. <br/><br/>This story had a good potential, but it was wasted with having mundane villains for a few minutes and having this movie more as a love story between peter and gwen.<br/><br/>Maybe I should have given this a lower rating, but the impressive CGI scenes and Andrew garfields performance kept it at a 6.<br/><br/>It could have got over a 7 if there was no boring subplot love story. Other ways it could have been better, more fighting scenes with the other villains.<br/><br/>Also, electro was the main villain and he was defeated pretty quickly. Spiderman did not find him as a threat once he made an upgrade to his Web things.<br/><br/>When I first wrote this review, I rated it a 7. However I don't think it was good enough for a 7. If I could give this an accurate rating, then I would give it a 6.7."
"bobbysing","6","0","3","2 June 2014"," A just OK sequel displaying its technical excellence, with far less entertaining content as compared to the earlier versions.
","One of the most loved superheroes (especially in the kids) comes with probably its weakest film till date with quite less entertaining elements as compared to its earlier versions. No doubt the sequel yet again displays an amazing technical excellence in all its actions sequences along with a spellbinding cinematography. But with a confusing opposition featuring two weak villains not able to justify their immense power and hatred, the conflict falls flat without making any solid impact on the viewer. And one seriously misses the expected depth and logical character developments in the script of one of the most awaited movies of the year, undoubtedly. For instance it has a highly absurd case of the 'villain by accident' (Jamie Fox), who has no visible reasoning of becoming so wicked with such evil intentions after getting electrocuted, all of a sudden.<br/><br/>Stressing too hard on the computer graphics, the director doesn't give much emphasis on the entertaining factor in the film and tries to cover up playing with the romance and an emotional twist in the end showcasing an unexpected tragedy. Now though the romance factor doesn't tease you much but still I honestly felt that is it necessary that a superhero always has to be involved romantically with a lady essentially.<br/><br/>In short, as a 3D film with great action sequences (surpassing the past ones), average performances and a pleasant emotional touch, many would not mind watching it once in all possibilities. But frankly speaking, for me it was really not worth the wait at all, with even the Spiderman looking as if he was on a diet plan."
"jhigginbotham151","4","0","3","1 June 2014"," An improvement, but its too much, way to much!
","I flat out hated the reboot when it came out two years ago. I stand by the fact it was unnecessary and really not as much fun or as entertaining as the previous Raimi films. Well, I still think its a pretty poor film and an even worse reboot considering it basically retells the original film in a much more unintresting way. But I digress, I still went into the sequel with high hopes for what they pull out of the bag for a second time around the bend.<br/><br/>They squeezed a lot into the films two hour and twenty minute runtime, I mean a tone, too much in fact, way too much. Electro, Harry Osborn, The Green Goblin, Relationship problems, Rhino, set up for Sinister Six movie, Norman Osbourne, Conspiracy involving Oscorp and Peters parents, Peters parents... Jesus do you think thats enough. The film simply tried to pack into much into short a time span, its that simple and thats the fatal flaw here. Webb promised that this wouldn't be another Spiderman 3 situation but it actually ended up being worse because believe it or not we actually have a villain who has an even worse set up that Venom.<br/><br/>Electro was just awful in terms of character. Max Dillon is a complete dork. He looks like a cliché nerd, he talks like a cliché nerd and he is just the most boring of characters. Webb wanted us to clearly sympathise with him but I don't sympathise with characters who have almost no clear motives for what they do and when there transformation is as forced as the Symbiotes arrival in Peters pocket in S3, yeah forget about it. Electro is awesome however in terms of his look and power. He looks incredible and his power is clearly shown and it looks awesome, the suit he wears is a little to comic book for the tone of the film but whatever.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is wasted, I don't need to say anything more, just a clear cheap setup for a spin off. Harry Osborn is actually a very interesting character and he is sympathetic until pretty much the last 40 minutes or so when I swear to god he gets one of the fastest transformation sequences in history, its so rushed its actually funny.His Goblin is actually quite good, I like the look and his laugh and his general performance of the character. BUT IT MAKES NO GODDAMN SENSE. His character is a complete departure from what he was before and don't you dare claim he went insane because I ain't accepting that.<br/><br/>So what saves it, what makes this film worth a six and worth the watch. The effects are brilliant, the best iv seen. Spiderman swinging through the city is the best iv seen of any spider man film, animated or live action, TV or film. The music is pretty great and Spideys theme is really good (not as good as Elmans theme, but pretty good). The dubstep that is used in Electros scenes really works well and I actually really like it, it isn't annoying. <br/><br/>But the key thing that I recommend this for is the relationship between Peter and Gwen, they are so cute its not even right. They have so much chemistry and their scenes together feel like scenes from a really good indie-film, in fact you care more about them than you do about the action, the action interrupts the film really.<br/><br/>Overall, mixed bag here but its worth a watch. All I know is, Sinister Six and Venom better be great or all this set up with have been pointless and I will never forgive Sony for not giving the rights back to Marvel... Good luck Sony, don't f#@k up/"
"moviemattb","7","0","2","1 June 2014"," Decent movie, but it seems to be kind of a mess
","This review may contain spoilers because I think I should give my reasons about the movie on whats right and wrong. I don't review movies that contain spoilers because I rather much prefer not to give away things that were in the movie; however, if I do give away I would say it only if the movie is already shown in theaters. This may or may not be the only review that I give out spoilers, but its not a big deal. Enjoy my review. I did go see ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" in theaters, and I thought it left me with a split reaction. Here are the good stuff: First, I said in my review of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" that James Horner's score was okay, but not as amazing as Danny Elfman's score. Although I did say that Horner's score may grew on me if I did say it or not. With that said, with James Horner out of the picture Hans Zimmer comes in to do score after scoring ""Man of Steel"" and The Dark Knight Trilogy."" How was it? It was pretty darn good. This may be better than Horner's, and may be the best one. Second, I thought the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey are very good. The acting in this movie is well done, but I give most props to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The action is great along with its wonderful special effects, and third, the Spider-Man costume look awesome. I do enjoy the last costume he wore in the last movie, but I enjoy this one the best. Not only is it faithful to the comics, but I really love the the textures and the details. It pretty much reminds me of the original Spider-Man suit in the Sam Raimi movies. So what's wrong with this movie? The villains in this movie are not interesting. It has nothing to do with the acting, and I don't think anyone did terrible. I just didn't buy anyone that I'm suppose to get invest with. Electro is our main villain in this movie, and I thought the filmmakers handle his character wrong. The design of him looks fine, but the way he portrays in this movie is like watching a clone version of Edward Nygma from ""Batman Forever."" He first starts off as fan of the city's savior, and then turns against him. Jamie Foxx is a fine actor, but he seems to be badly directed and not portraying him right as he was in the comics. Paul Giamatti plays Rhino in this movie, but he is only there for short time and has nothing much to do. Like Foxx, a fine actor. Now before I talk about Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, I like to point out on Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn. He is only there for a cameo, and just dies already. We don't see him become the Green Goblin, but we see Harry instead. Looks like Cooper is only here for a check. Now DeHaan, he may be a fine actor as I seen him in ""Chronicle"" but he seems to be too much to play both Harry and his alter ego. While the design of the original Green Goblin was alright in the original first movie, but this design is way overdone. They probably may him too menacing for the actor, and wish if they tone him down a bit. He does become the Green Goblin at the end, but it seems to be rushed. I know the Green Goblin is suppose to be menacing, but not that menacing. Willem Dafoe, in my opinion, did better because not only he was serious, but he was also having a fun time as well. He is like Spider Man's own Joker because he laughs, and kills people. So that is my own thoughts on the Green Goblin. The story itself is not balance well enough because at times it can be serious like Christopher Nolan or Tim Burton, while at other times it can be like Joel Schumacher. Also, I thought the marketing isn't really that good because they gave away in the trailers and other stuff that I know maybe others do know that Gwen Stacey is suppose to die in this movie. That just ruins the suspense, and should have not been giving away to those who may have not read the comic books. This movie is on par with ""Spider-Man 3"" because they both have flaws, but they are enjoyable. Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is decent movie, but it seems to be kind of a mess. I give this movie a 7 out of 10."
"gorangogo","3","0","3","1 June 2014"," Most Forgettable Superhero Movie of 2014
","I saw this movie a few weeks ago and I have to say, loving the first one and being excited for this... I was extremely disappointed. There really wasn't anything about this movie that grabbed me besides the villains, who didn't have nearly enough screen time (I can go on forever about the shoe horned Green Goblin at the end)and the whole plot of ""Oh I love you Gwen Stacy! But I can't be with you because I feel guilty... But I'll still be with you! Now I won't."" was really boring and felt done to death. What partially saved it was that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have great chemistry. There's a lot more I want to talk about but since I don't want to write multiple pages I'll just bring up my main problem with the movie that made it so forgettable to me: the plot.... is such... a mess.... if the movie was solely set up for other movies it would be okay, but as a movie it's just awful. The reason I'll always remember the Winter Soldier and Days of Future Past is because the plots to both of those were beautifully written, cohesive, and extremely interesting. This film just felt like a collection of random scenes that were meant to be Spider-man 2, but the editor took a bunch of crack before. I just can't recommend this movie for a full price 3D showing, but if you have a couple hours for matinée go for it. Oh and worst music selection to a movie I've seen in an extremely long time. Gone, Gone, Gone by Phillip Phillips almost couldn't have played at a more inappropriate time."
"bvswearingen","4","0","3","31 May 2014"," Not as good as the 1st
","The 1st installment in the Amazing Spider-Man series I thought was AMAZING! (I mean it tells you that in the title!) That movie had great cast. The villain was well put together and overall it was an amazing movie! So you can tell why as I walked into the premier showing I was disappointed after the movie. First of all there are so many sub-plots happening that the whole plot falls apart. Like what happened to his parents, or his relationship with Gwen, and the whole OSCORP thing. So many things to think about. The plot was terrible and ruined the movie. But the biggest flaw... ELECTRO. I mean come on! Some guy who turns evil just because he got a little mad at spider-man. Also, he fell 20 feet into a pile of electric eels and all of a sudden he has super powers. COME ON! Now onto the good things. The new spider-man movie brought some amazing action scenes and a lot more comedy than the 1st one. Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield were AMAZING as always! Especially Emma as Gwen! The movie had a great cast. Also the Green Goblin was so awesome in it! If it had focused more on him than Electro it would have been a lot better. Overall a must-see for Comic book fans, but don't get your hopes up for it."
"wsheumaker","6","0","3","31 May 2014"," Disappointing after an incredible first film
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a big disappointment after the incredible first film. It does deliver on action and comedy plus the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is fabulous but there is just to much going on here. The conclusion to Rami's trilogy suffered from having too many villains and excessive subplots. Did Marc Webb even understand why Spider-Man 3 suffered; because he makes the same mistake in the second film of his Spidey franchise. Harry Osborn was a very well done villain in this movie but he didn't get the time that he deserved as the countless other subplots kept getting in the way. Max Dillon's story, Peter and Gwen deciding if they are together or not, Peter trying to discover the truth about his parents, and the list just keeps going. If Harry had been the main villain, this film could have been so much better; but then there is Max or Electro rather. Max is a guy who was never really loved and then he gets shocked electric eels and becomes evil! And how did this nice, harmless guy become evil again? He gets ticked off after the news screens in Times Square switch to a view off Spidey instead of his glowing, blue self. What a powerful origin story! Not. Amongst all of this it may seem that there is nothing good about this movie. Don't fear, there is. This movie is much funnier than the first which is satisfying in a way. However where this flick really shines is the scenes that Garfield has with Emma Sone and Sally Field. These scenes are pure gold and are really the best part of this movie, it will leave you smiling until you realize that we have to switch back to another subplot rather than look at pretty Emma Stone. Overall, this film is enjoyable, and if you didn't like the first movie you will probably love this one but as a big fan of the first one, I was pretty disappointed. There is just too much of Spider-Man and not enough of Peter Parker in this installment."
"sunshinebeachcinema","6","0","3","27 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man 2! Another Superhero Movie! Another Sequel!
","I've said it before, but it feels like an overwhelming number of mainstream films these days are superhero films. Better yet, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 manages to tick the box of being a sequel in a franchise that has already been rebooted since the millennium.<br/><br/>With the open-ended conclusion of Spider-Man 3 still fresh in our minds, this retelling of a story we've already heard reminds us what the future probably holds for superhero movies; a series of reboots with unsatisfying conclusions when the franchise loses steam – something which I suppose is directly reflective of the unbroken series of arcs and reinventions that actual comic book fans have been experiencing since the 1960s, so really, it's just another way in which these films are staying true to their sources. Well done, guys!<br/><br/>Criticism aside, Harry's arc here is different. He suffers from a debilitating genetic disease, and the anger at Spider-Man is not due to the death of Norman Osborn at the webslinger's hands (this Harry hated the guy), but because Spider-Man refuses to contribute his unique DNA to the project.<br/><br/>I am a James Franco fan, but the new guy (Dane DeHaan) gives a compelling performance. He's great as a troubled rich kid, who's just inherited the company and has to deal with the sneering disapproval of his board of directors. His complete absence from the first film is a little jarring when he's supposed to be one of Peter Parker's oldest and dearest friends: 'Hey dude, it's me, Harry, remember? That guy who you haven't seen in ten years? Remember the good times? Yeah, the good times were good, weren't they buddy?' Remember that good old Franco was there from the beginning.<br/><br/>Harry does get one of the most satisfying moments in the film though – a brilliant comeuppance (albeit temporary) for the corrupt corporate executive who ousted him from control of Oscorp. Harry's set up as a villain, but he's one of the most sympathetic characters in the film, certainly more so than the main villain, Electro (Jamie Foxx).<br/><br/>Electro started life as a downtrodden and introverted technician at Oscorp, who was given electrical superpowers in a freak accident. Oscorp's definitely the place to start hanging around if you want something to give you superpowers. He teams up with Harry, whom he sees as a kindred spirit, I guess, and while it's hugely satisfying to see him calling the shots for once, after all the trouble everyone's been giving him, he does act a little creepily in his spare time, and has a misguided sense of what the world owes him.<br/><br/>Foxx does well, although it's not as compelling a performance as some of the highlights of his career (Collateral, Miami Vice, Law Abiding Citizen, Django Unchained, he's had quite a ride, and I haven't seen all of his movies. It's a shame I missed White House Down, but I digress). To be honest, you can barely tell who's playing the character once the accident turns him into a computer-generated cloud of sparks.<br/><br/>The final fight with Electro, amongst the transformers of a high-tech power station massively over-exploits the contrast between orange and blue which is used so often in film, especially in posters, to the extent that it's become a cliché. Here, they're almost the only two colours on screen. The soundtrack during this fight however, is really inspired; a rock and dubstep influenced score with a huge, satisfying power chord echoing through the cinema every time Electro destroys a transformer. He even teases Spider-Man by using this musical ability to play The Itsy Bitsy Spider.<br/><br/>While I've waxed about how the 'new' (or as the producers would have you believe 'amazing') Spider-Man is just like its predecessors, I haven't touched much on the differences. They've drawn fresh villains from the existing rogues' gallery, so that all five Spider-Man films pitch the titular hero against a unique villain, the one exception being Harry Osborn's goblin. His appearance immediately after the fight with Electro does feel a little tacked on; Sam Raimi's trilogy spread the Osborn arc over three movies, with Harry's vengeance bubbling in the background for quite some time.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a more self assured Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire was, at least at first. He approaches crime fighting with a teenager's light-hearted humour, frequently improvising and dropping mid-fight wisecracks. There's a great moment when he disappears for a few moments and then blasts Electro out of the sky with a fireman's hose – when the camera cuts to Spidey, he's wearing a fireman's helmet.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in this film – in addition to everything I've mentioned, there's a clock tower, an abandoned subway station, eels, a mental asylum complete with evil scientist, and one of those investigative walls of crazy where keywords are drawn on post-it notes and everything is connected by lengths of red string.<br/><br/>There's also a romance in there somewhere – Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and the dilemma of the promise that Spider-Man made to her late father are at the forefront of Peter Parker's human dilemma. It's got problems, but this is mainly baggage associated with the superhero/reboot/sequel world the film inhabits. Treat it as a standalone piece of work, and it's still a decent film, and I forgive it everything for the director being named Marc Webb. That's got to be providence."
"jadepietro","6","0","3","27 May 2014"," Tangled
","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>As sequels usually prove, the first time is the best. So it goes with Marc Webb's second installment of the Spiderman legend. The Amazing Spiderman 2 is an entertaining but ultimately unsatisfying movie, especially when compared to its wonderful predecessor. (That 2012 film made it to my top ten films list that year.) While there are some nice aerial movements with our comic book hero once again and time is wisely spent on the human interest angle, this latest chapter lacks interesting villains, has many (too many) action sequences that go on far too long, and enough sub-plots to foul up even the most super of superheroes. Nothing connects and the overall effect is tedious and overbearing.<br/><br/>When we last left our Peter Parker / Spidey, (again, very well played by Andrew Garfield), he was still enmeshed in dangerous adventures to rid the world of evildoers and enamored by the sweet and independently minded Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Now, in The Amazing Spiderman 2, Mr. Parker continues to protect the citizenry of New York and pine for Gwen. He is reticent to commit to his true love due to his promise made to her dying father: end the relationship with Gwen for her own safety. The chemistry between the two leads is still palpable, due to the talented actors in these roles, and one care about this young couple and their dilemmas. But it's more of the same with less impact. <br/><br/>Peter still has abandonment and father issues after being left behind for his Aunt May to raise, but he has lost a bit of the boyish charm and seems rather smug and cocky in this outing. (Sally Field does yeoman-like work in her small but pivotal scenes as his doting guardian.) Spiderman still fights a good fight, but his swagger and pouty expression seems interminable. <br/><br/>Director Marc Webb keeps his action moving, but can't control the multiple story lines and narrative structure of the film. The fault is mainly with a lame script by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Jeff Pinkner that tries too hard. This screenplay by committee approach results in awkward dialog, contrived situations, and lacks any real dramatic tension. It strains when it should soar. Spiderman's clever one-line retorts aren't. The villains come in droves and two out of three are bad, but not in a good way: Electro (Jamie Foxx) is the main nemesis and his character is played sympathetically at times and pathetically for most of the other times; Rhino (a wasted Paul Giamatti) seems like a mere afterthought and lacks any gravitas; the only effective foe is Harry Osborn a.k.a. Green Goblin, who makes his appearance far too late in the film to register much of his full menace, although he is nicely played by Dane DeHaan. (There is also a dreadful evil doctor played atrociously by Marton Csokas. This actor, poorly directed by Webb, delivers his lines in a thick German accent that only Frau Blücher could love.)<br/><br/>The CGI has its moments of awe and wonder in some of its well staged battles, but the imagery of two of its villains, Electro and Rhino, never impresses as it should. (Green Goblin, however, is a compelling force and holds promise for future encounters.) Much of the set design looks too fabricated with much noise and destruction which is so common in the crash and burn bedlam on the big screen these days.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman 2 tries to spin its web of action and suspense, but it hopelessly gets entangled in its own confusing and chaotic plot devices that continually gum up the works. Amazing it's not. GRADE: B- <br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

The actor .. who I later found out to be British and that explained A LOT (Andrew Garfield) blew every line, every moment, stilted, and apologetic over every scene and he should be. I have been to Britain (4 times and worked with brits (over a year all in... smart, clever, rude (it's OK to be rude if you are clever about it ... in Britain)) and ALWAYS apologizing for ... the air they breathe. Big hair does not make great acting. He may be a great actor and I wish him all the best in Shakespeare, self effacing apologetic, colonialism, wedding funeral movies ever made. .. but Spiderman ... a GOOD soul given superpowers ... conflicted over his family and future family choices .... American ... and they cast Andrew Garfield.. in a word NOPE.<br/><br/>Please pay Tobey Maguire to do the next one or let the Franchise just DIE.

","I am a fan of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. Spider-Man 3 was a huge disappointment, hence they ushered in the Amazing Spider-Man. Well, I didn't like The Amazing Spider-Man and part two may have been worse.<br/><br/>There were just way too many slow tearful moments. I mean... who didn't cry in this movie? This was a soap opera with some action. I've never seen the Twilight series, but this movie is what I imagine the Twilight series is like.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were OK but nothing that hasn't been seen already in the four prior Spider-Mans. There was a nice tie in to the first The Amazing Spider-Man, but story-wise there was not much there. Summertime is for action and oohs and aahs. TAS2 provided some action, no oohs and aahs but instead plenty of melodrama and give-me-a-break high school romance. Not a good follow up to the first. I'm sure they'll do a third installment, but it needs to be significantly better."
"Robert_duder","7","0","3","22 May 2014"," The far too soon reboot already starts to show flaws
","Despite the fact that The Amazing Spiderman was an unnecessary and far too soon reboot, the first one was pretty darn entertaining. I was very sceptical they could continue this success given this was simply too soon! I was right and wrong. The Amazing Spiderman 2 is still reasonably entertaining. However, they dug themselves the exact same grave that Raimi's Spiderman did. Why do film makers not understand that crowded a movie with two or three movies worth of material make it more ""epic?"" One villain, one hero, one story...maybe a sub story is all that is required. Amazing Spiderman 2 has multiple villains, multiple stories and enough content to be spread over another movie. The special effects are very good, even the CGI was decent enough. The acting is decent but for two (more like three) would be excellent villains they get half of the screen time and character development that they should have. It just feels messy at times. Now all that negativity out of the way the film does feel epic in stature at times, just the way a superhero film should. They absolutely bring Spidey to life (even if some of his more well known quirks feel a little forced.)<br/><br/>I wasn't sure how Andrew Garfield would fare as Spiderman originally. He is a terrific actor but was he right for this? He did a very solid job in the first but this time around I started to see some things about his portrayal that didn't strike me in the right way. His Peter Parker is too awkward, almost eccentric and he physical quirks are almost irritating. He is much better as Spiderman but plays it over the top. I just think Tobey Maquire was more believable and better suited. Garfield is either too serious in the role or overplaying it. Emma Stone is very good as Gwen. Her and Garfield have good chemistry and she is such an incredibly versatile actress/comedian and this is a good turn for her. Her character has always been the most developed and gets a lot of the best story. Jamie Foxx is our villain Electro. Foxx is also very talented obviously and he is great as the villain. The problem is the lack of development for his character and how incredibly predictable and typical his character is. The geeky, nerdy and misunderstood before and the powerful mutated villain after. Its excruciatingly cookie cutter. There is just too many superhero flicks out there to replay the same old story. Dane DeHaan takes over the helm of Harry Osborn and Green Goblin. I can understand introducing Osborn but to add in Goblin was too much. DeHaan is decent and could be campy but actually pulls off the insane role quite well. Main supporting cast includes Sally Field, Colm Feore and Felicity Jones, all of whom are good.<br/><br/>When I see a film like this I can practically sense how over-eager and excited the director gets. Marc Webb managed to successfully reboot a series that most people thought was too soon and then he excitedly jammed everything into a sequel (which made a ton of money so what do I know?) I did enjoy it, but I was far from floored by it. As usual, the 3D did nothing for me and was unimpressive. That isn't the fault of the film but I still have yet to see 3D really blow me away in any way. The story moves along at a good pace but as I said is very crowded. The humour feels significantly forced at certain times especially Spidey's one-liners (humming the old cartoon Spiderman theme was not amusing and not even cheeky but rather forced and annoying.) The best part of the story is the relationship between Gwen and Peter and their romance. I can understand and appreciate they chose not to introduce Mary Jane because you really do become invested in their young romance even though she is not his ""soul mate"" so to speak. Most fans of Spiderman will rejoice in this sequel and there are some good points to it but for me it was a gradual step down from the first film and a significant step down from Raimi's trilogy. I think a change in director might be their best move at this point before this series gets buried like the last. 7/10"
"videodrome1234","5","0","4","22 May 2014"," Spider-Man is not Captain America....
","Okay before I get into the review let me tell you that I like comic book films, but none of the spider man that have been made thus far have really peaked my interest. Though the first trilogy was closer to the Spiderman comics I'm familiar with I still found the first part of this new reboot to be a better film, that said even that wasn't more that a 5 out of 10 film. Anyway so Spiderman is an interesting character in the Marvel universe, he does have a few stories that are more serious than what we have seen brought to life on screen so far but mainly the films are juvenile as is the comic. That's not to say that this is a problem, but lets be honest over a certain age its hard to like it. The problem isn't that it's funny ('cause Thor is funny now too...) but that the whole thing is awkward like a teenager. While jumping between buildings he makes strange noises his calls the bad guys Mr. Criminal and chats with his gf during action scenes. So it's pretty hard to take him seriously. The first film paved the way for this childish road, even if it was tighter than the old trilogy, especially the almost unwatchable 3rd part, but I still think the new reboot didn't succeed in stepping away from the problems of the old trilogy, its just a new Spidy film because they make money. Let's talk about the story: After a little back story about Parker's parents, Spiderman is torn between having a life and being a superhero. While he quickly finished with Paul Giamatti's character (who isn't rhino yet) and saves a few people – a school kid being bullied and Jamie Fox's character before he becomes Electro. He hears about Harry Osborn's dad dyeing so he goes to pay his respects. They get a little nostalgic and make friends. All the while of course Jamie Fox turns into Electro so it's time for a huge battle. It takes place and then things get complicated by Electro, Harry Osborn and Oscorp. I won't give away the ending. The positive things in the film are that it really looks good. All the things we saw in the first trilogy are brought back here twice as well done – even if sometimes the digital Spiderman bothers me – What I also liked is the chemistry between the two actors. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone work well together, I didn't even really have a problem with Dane Dehaan either side note my biggest problem was Jamie Fox who had no idea how to play a silly, brainless and useless character. Anyway back to the positives its 140 minutes just flew by. Okay and now the negative: Based on the trailers it looked way too busy, with too many bad guys, but the film removed them in one fell swoop, two of them don't take up too much screen time and it just leaves the whole thing open for sequels. Electro was center-stage in the trailers but Rhino looked like he would have had the same size role. He didn't. I feel cheated. In fact I'm disgusted. There is only one bad guy in this film and the other two are mere footnotes there are not three enemies. The other problem is the useless script, and to think it took four people to write it. Four! The whole thing felt like it was a bunch of scenes tacked together that have nothing to do with each other and don't have a linear time line. It was just plain confusing. It made all the mistakes that the first part made 2 years ago trying to bite off more that they can chew... It opened in twice as many movies and wanted to double up on everything... but what happens if you try to double nothing? Just that nothing. I think Sony should start trying to change styles. This just didn't hit the mark. It's just a visual orgy with a confused story that I give 4 points to out of 10. https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1"
"classicalsteve","6","0","3","22 May 2014"," Too-Cool Garfield as Spider-man and Disjointed Storyline Makes for Mixed Superhero Film
","Stan Lee's original idea in the creation of Spider-man was to portray a typical teenage kid with all the navigation problems of someone of that age while also including a superhero alter-ego in the mix. Peter Park, who becomes Spider-man, was in his original conception an orphaned science wiz-kid who was bitten by a radioactive spider which gave him powers and abilities similar to those of a spider while still remaining a human being. Unfortunately, the present installments of ""the Amazing Spider-man"" on film with Andrew Garfield as Spider-man has changed much about what made Peter Parker a compelling character.<br/><br/>While Garfield is a relatively convincing actor playing roles 10 years younger than his real age, the studios have opted to re-invent Peter Parker as a cool hip late teen. Instead of the nerdy wiz kid of the 1960's and 70's, the new Parker looks more like the lead singer of the latest all-boy teen pop sensation. The problem with Garfield as Peter Parker is he's just too cool and good-looking. He dates the best-looking girl in school, who also happens to be the valedictorian, and sports perfect hair and complexion which were probably made possible by the make-up artists of Vogue Magazine. Peter Parker of the original never quite fit in as a teen in school, and his becoming Spider-man helped him act out a kind of fantasy which he couldn't as Peter Parker. I think the biggest problem I had with believing Garfield was Parker was that I didn't see why the best-looking male in school would need to don a costume and right wrongs. For the nerdy not perfect-looking Parker it makes more sense. For the way-too-cool Garfield who looks like Justin Bieber's older brother, I couldn't buy him as Peter Parker, the brilliant but geeky kid who wasn't popular. Garfield comes off as the not-so-brilliant but highly popular teen who would have a waiting list of girls who desire to date him.<br/><br/>Aside from the problem with casting, the current film has some interesting aspects and very confusing plot elements. The film begins with a flash-back of a couple we learn later were Peter Parker's true parents, Richard and Mary Parker. Richard has been engaged in some kind of top secret project which turns out to be both lucrative and very dangerous. Fast-forward to the present. Parker, now just graduated from high school, learns that his father and his boyhood friend Harry's father were both involved in research to foster regeneration through DNA found in spiders. Harry has now inherited his father's corporation, Oscorp, but also has inherited a degenerative disease. He comes to believe a transfusion of Spider-man's blood will offer him the regenerative abilities he needs to cure himself.<br/><br/>At the same time, at Oscorp, a lowly but brilliant technician through an accident, gains power through electricity, becoming one of Spider-man's archenemies, Electro. At first, the person who became Electro and Harry appear to be on good terms with Peter Parker. Eventually, they both become his adversaries. Intertwined through the story is the love affair between Parker and Gwen (Emma Stone). For some reason, I felt the love story aspect was allowed too much screen time, and the other plots about Harry and Electro were underdeveloped. The story becomes a kind of foursome, with Harry and Electro challenging Spider-man and in some ways his girl Gwen, who also works for Oscorp.<br/><br/>A decent but somewhat confusing story. Much screen-time is devoted to long action sequences and the love story, but the plot about the corporation and the secret research is underdeveloped and not explained thoroughly. While still relatively entertaining, the script probably needed about 2 or 3 more rewrites. Less Spider-man flying around and more about his father and the secret research. It kind of gets better as it goes along but I had many questions which were left unanswered by film's end."
"alexcomputerkid","7","0","4","21 May 2014"," The Amazing Spider Man 2 and this whole reboot series sure seems like a big question mark
","In 2012, the first Spider-Man came out from the new reboot series and it came out in a very ""out of the blue"" way. I can't say I never did appreciate a Spider-Man film though because Spider-Man is for sure one of my favorite superheroes out there. Why though, would they create a Spider-Man series five years after the last film in the original series?<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man of 2012 still was a positive even with all the hate I give it. It brought in new rising stars who we got to know and it played well in the summer market. The film got a new audience for this famous Marvel character and it generated sequels.<br/><br/>In this movie, following the events in last movie, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is really up in the air (no pun intended) with his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and a new villain, Electro (Jamie Fox) comes into the spotlight. Peter Parker also must deal with an old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) who is now in charge of Oscorp and who's emotions turn him into the villain the Green Goblin. Parker is sure dealing with lot of stuff and it's starts to show.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is again likable which makes you wish he was around more often in films. He has very good chemistry with his co-star Emma Stone but the story of them trying to solve their relationship is surely past done by now. Still though, they make this film and I don't know where this film would be without the two of them together. Electro is nerdy and not a mentally stable guy and it's quite interesting for him to be in this film because he is not the most known villain in the Spider-Man universe which makes him original. The special effects with him are quite quirky and of a different vibe than what we have seen before but like the most characters in this film, his pacing is way off. Rising star, Dane DeHaan known for the forgotten but solid film Chronicle is just as silly as Electro but it's Dehaan himself who eventually who ruins this character for us. He can't develop the character himself making it a mundane character nor is his acting really up to a par. Even the usually lovable Sally Field as Aunt Jane is nowhere to be found and really adds nothing to film even when she is around.<br/><br/>There also isn't much of a plot here. Sure, these characters do add something but a large portion of the film wanders around going nowhere and the movie has some really bad pacing. You would expect the typical long, action battle scenes to end the story and here the last battle scene sure does change the whole series. The main settings is New York City which it had to be but really you know what you are getting with this setting by now. It' a plot that has a lot to it but doesn't really go anywhere with it. I give the substance here a barely passing grade.<br/><br/>These are probably some reasons why this is movie is getting hated on after only one week at the top of the box office. You have wonder what Sony Pictures thinks of the future now for this series. This reboot continues to introduce us to new things to this character that we never thought would come to us but still fails to deliver the necessary stuff to make a really good Spider-Man film. I can't even say that I'm even looking forward to the likely sequels coming in the next few years and I never said this when the original sequels were coming. The Amazing Spider Man 2 and this whole reboot series sure seems like a big question mark to me."

Actually the plot is classic but efficient and gripping. 2h30 might seem long but it's not a problem !<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of the comic books I think you won't like this film as much as the first saga because it's much darker. According to me, it makes it more interesting and mature.<br/><br/>However the acting is average. There is no psychological evolution of the characters even after Gwen has died. In regard to the music, I was disappointed because it was neither epic nor interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this movie because it's very entertaining."

","As a Spidey fan and I am really disappointed by the film.The amazing spiderman 2 is probably the worst movie in spiderman series. The movie is so predictable that 'the beginning was its end'.The storyline of the film felt very weak with tons of characters clustered in the whole movie. I did not like how they still continued with the whole thing about what happened to peter's parents they died get over it. I did not think it was a good move or the right moment to kill off a major character that makes the movie work so well with their presence. The film was still entertaining and it had good fighting action sequences. I thought the special and visual effects were totally amazing. I still felt the script and dialogue was very lazy and it had no character development.Here's some flaws:<br/><br/>How electro got the power of invisiblity.<br/><br/>How harry got to electro with just 2 guards knockout.<br/><br/>The opening scene where spiderman jokes with this 'villain' is absurd. Risking lives to joke with him as he drives a van of radioactive material through the town.<br/><br/>Lastly The Amazing Spiderman 2 may have its moments but it fails to prove as 'Amazing' as promised by the title."
"chirajit-nath","Null","0","4","20 May 2014"," Overall decent film, good action scenes and great chemistry between the leads
","I went into the theater with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The highlight of the film has to be the action sequences which are beautifully rendered and the 3D does help to immerse us into the scenes. The story does play an important role and we do get some answers that the first film posed but all that are just an excuse that leads to just bigger action scenes. Even the emotional scenes are seemed to be wrapped around the action scenes even though it could have presented in a much simpler way (note: the opening scenes from the film) The Screenplay is at times uneven and just not that fresh enough, as it is riddled with clichés that we have seen in films from this genres before. Even the villains are not that interesting, Jamie Foxx's Electro as a character is total let down since his motivation in the film seems flimsy. Dana DeHana's role as Harry Osborne does have its moments but the arc of his character is all over the place. I couldn't decide whether I should feel sympathetic to him or just treat him like your garden variety psycho crazed villain.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's take as the masked hero (Peter Parker aka Spiderman) fairs a little better than it did the last time. It seems that he is more comfortable in the suit this time around. He is naturally charming in the comedic scenes and especially while dealing the bad guys, and even in the emotional scenes he holds his ground. Emma Stone does a wonderful job the second time around being Peter Parker's love interest Gwen Stacy. Actually some of the best scenes (other than the action scenes) are between Peter and Gwen. Director Marc Webb shines in these scenes since the chemistry between them unmistakably sweet & beautiful and it does have a genuine effect during the climactic battle. The rest of the supporting cast does a good job with whatever little screen time that they are given. In the end the film sets up wonderfully for the future films and the direction that the franchise plans to take.<br/><br/>Overall it's a decent entertaining film with good action scenes and a great chemistry between the lead pair. It may not be the best Spiderman film but it's not the worst either."
"naweendyawick","7","0","3","20 May 2014"," It's truly a nice story but doesn't give you the feeling to watch it again
","The romantic tale between Peter and Gwen is just wonderful. Which is why I guess Gwen's death makes such an impact , well i felt really bad ; couldn't sleep that night and it's a bit injustice when you think of Electro's past and his faith. Also they should have widen Peter's and harry's friendship . By the way the fights are too subtle . Battles are really interesting but too short. The movie could have also introduced Spidey's ability to shoot webs naturally like a natural spider , could have made him more closer to a real spider and the trailer doesn't go with the movie in many scenes which is a bit irritating when what you expect don't appear in a movie. makes it look incomplete ."
"bluesman-20","Null","0","2","20 May 2014"," With Great power comes great responsibility.
","Marc Webb rewrote Spider-man with his last movie. And he got so many things right. With the Amazing Spider-man II Webb continues to reinvent Spider-man. His take on Spider-man is a mature one. And one that follows the potential that Spider-man always had. He was created to be the hero who could be you. Spider-man was created to showcase a super hero who was not rich or had the powers of a god . Instead he had the powers of a Spider. And the maturity to realize that he had the power to change lives for the better after tragic cicrcumstances forced him to realize he had to Help those in need and to protect the helpless and fight evil and stop crime. Even though the cost to him at times is high. and That PEter PArker's life can become a chaotic mess. He never fails to be the hero he has to be. That's the difference between Nolan's Dark Knight Movies and Webb's Spider-man films. Webb can explore the darker issues of being a superhero but he keeps it fun.. Andrew Garfield is simply perfect as Peter Parker. When the Amazing Spider-man was first released I was a strong Toby fan. I wanted to hate Andrew but couldn't. He brought the hero to life with his quips. And his actions. Where Raimi was quick to imply the cost of being a hero. But rarely showed it. Webbb Shows us in every heart breaking detail. Where Raimi shyed away from certain details. Webb Shows us. And Because he shows us he Adds a more rounded dimension to Spider-man. The only beef I do have is omission of scenes that were shown in the trailer. but not in the movie. There literally is more then enough story for two movies and there is a major set up for Amazing Spider -man III. This movie is a comic book come to life. Webb and company do their best to transform the world of the comic book into the real world and it works. Webb proves that not all Super hero films need to be dark and full of angry avenging figures. sometimes they can be colourful figures that simply enjoy being who they are and the enjoy it to the fullest. the only advice I can give is sit back grab your popcorn and your drink. And watch the movie and to be prepared to be amazed."
"fkrakue","7","0","2","20 May 2014"," Surprisingly compelling!!
","I must admit, as a staunch Sam Raimi fan I was initially very reluctant to go and see The Amazing Spiderman. But then I was curious to see how the franchise would be revamped. Though I was left somewhat nonplussed by the first film, I found the second surprisingly compelling.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film immensely from the outset. It did something that the franchise had yet to do – explore further the lives of Peter's parents. We also saw a lot more of Aunt May, and her struggle adjusting to life without Uncle Ben. <br/><br/>We had 2 villains – both quite formidable, particularly Jamie Foxx's Electro – with different, but similar motives. Electro felt invisible and he wanted to be seen – however, his motivations for wanting to kill Spiderman were a little weak. I understood he didn't like the fact that Spiderman was getting all the attention, but he did remember his name and he did want to help him. At any rate, he was clearly irrational so I suppose his motivation to kill Spiderman didn't exactly have to make a lot of sense. But going after Spiderman definitely did give him a purpose. Foxx's performance was fairly decent as well, he really brought the character to life in an unexpected way. I especially loved him as the fumbling, balding Max Dillon at the beginning, he was certainly a character that I'm sure many can relate to – feeling lonely, invisible, brilliance going unnoticed.<br/><br/>In general, the pace of the movie was good. It had highs and lows, light and shade. There were extended action scenes when there needed to be extended action scenes, and quiet intimate scenes at the right moment.<br/><br/>The special effects were rather incredible. I loved Spiderman's sarcasm and cavalier attitude. The film was visually gripping as well, and had a strong message as its undercurrent, securing an emotional connection to the audience. <br/><br/>The message to take home from this movie is that you can choose the way you respond to misfortune. You can be like Harry, who turned to villainy, or like Peter who decided to go on doing what he did best: giving hope to the people of the city."
"starry42","7","0","3","17 May 2014"," Better than the first.
","This sequel to Marc Webb's Spidey reboot shares something in common with Raimi's second movie. It is better than its predecessor. Now while I didn't think The first ""Amazing Spider- Man"" was entirely bad, it took some getting used to these newer versions of established characters. But my biggest problem with Webb's reboot was that it dragged a bit too much, but this sequel did not waste anytime. It jumped right into the action, and was a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Asides from returning actors such as Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Sally Field, there are a few new faces to introduce. Filling James Franco's shoes as Harry Osborne is Dane DeHaan, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Emo Peter from Raimi's third film. Appearance aside, his performance starts out a little weak, but gets much better as the movie progresses. When he actually becomes the Green Goblin, his acting really shines, despite a somewhat goofy look that put's Willem Dafoe's Power Ranger-esque suit to shame.<br/><br/>The main villain, however, is Electro, played greatly by Jamie Foxx. Now I, like many, laughed when the first image of Foxx's electro was revealed, but he turned in a performance that more than made up his appearance. He starts out as Oscorp employee Max Dillon, the stereotypical obsessed fan who looks up to Spidey after he saves his life. The way in which he is transformed into Electro is quite creative. Paul Giamatti briefly appears as Rhino, and I must be honest. He was not at his best here. Giamatti is a good actor, but he was beyond over the top in this one. It seems clear, though, that he will be in the next film, so he will have time to work on his performance.<br/><br/>Bottom line, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" exceeded my expectations. I honestly did not know if I would like it or hate it, but in the end, I found it to be quite an adrenaline rush, which is exactly how I like my superhero movies. Not since ""Iron Man 3"" have I felt myself sliding out of the seat so much. I am now really excited for the next one, where it is hinted that the Sinister Six will appear."
"hardyparty","6","0","3","16 May 2014"," not as good as the first
","First let me start by saying that this movie is too damn long, almost 2 and a half hours and that is too much for a movie like this. I didn't really like Jamie Foxx's electro character because I thought he was lame and it was kind of cliché how he got he's powers. The entire movie was like a roller-coaster ride. Peter's relationship with Gwen, electro, peter's relationship, electro etc and it was kind of annoying. Another thing people might not catch was that THE SUIT WAS DIFFERENT! I don't know if it's just me, but the sit in this movie looked a lot cheaper then the first and that was one of the things I liked about the movie. Too long, mixed plot with to many characters and weird suit, but on a good note there was good things about the film. The action was pretty good and the special effects want bad either. I know I complained about the time length of the movie but at least I got my moneys worth. Overall don't really get too hype for this movie."
"randy_orton_fan","Null","0","5","16 May 2014"," A fun film that kept me invested and left me satisfied at the end
","I have seen a lot of remarks about this movie. People just don't seem to like it that much. Personally, I thought it was fantastic. It was just as good as the Raimi films.<br/><br/>The characters were great, the action was great, the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy was amazing (let's be honest, that's because they are dating in real life, so there isn't much acting required). Peter and Gwen spend much of the movie apart, because Gwen breaks up with Peter at the beginning because he keeps trying to distance himself from her because he is haunted by visions of her father, who he promised in the first film that he would stay away from Gwen to protect her. Gwen is planning on leaving for Oxford, which makes things harder for Peter in dealing with things<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx's Electro was awesome. I was worried that his character would suck, because in the comics, Electro isn't really that interesting of a character. I love how he's portrayed in this film. He's this lonely guy who has no one who seems to really notice or care about him, so when Spider-man (arguably the most famous person in the city in the film) notices him and calls him ""Partner"" and ""My eyes and ears out here"", Max feels pretty special. His motivation for attacking Spider-man comes from the fact that he feels Spider-man is selfish and is hogging all of the attention and spotlight Max feels he deserves. In some ways, that seems like a stupid reason to want someone dead. Okay, in a lot of ways. But Jamie Foxx pulls if off.<br/><br/>Dane Dehaan's Harry Osborn is introduced in this film, and watching his desperation to find a cure for the disease that killed his father and is killing him is interesting to watch. Because Dehaan pulls it off. You can feel his desperation, especially in the scene when he meets with Spider-man in his office. He believes Spider-man's blood can save him, but Spider-man refuses because he doesn't know what it would do to Harry. He's cautious because he saw what experimenting without proper testing did to Curt Conners in the first film.<br/><br/>After Harry is framed for having prisoners (including Max) experimented on at Ravencroft, Harry goes to Max for help. I love the reasoning Max had for actually helping Harry, a guy he had every right to want dead (head of Oscorp, Oscorp is who turned him into a freak), but when Harry tells him he's dying and that he needs Max, Max is willing to help. Because a guy who has no one feels pretty special when someone actually needs him. They break into Oscorp, and using the venom from the spiders (that bit Peter and made him Spider-man), becomes the Green Goblin. He puts on an armored suit his father designed to try to save himself, and the Goblin is complete.<br/><br/>Peter and Gwen team up to stop Electro at the power grid, and in the ensuing fight, Electro is overcharged and explodes. It plays it up like he's dead, but I don't see this version of Electro being done in by it. Harry shows up and deduces that Spider-man is Peter, which throws him into a rage. When Spider-man refused to help him, it meant Peter refused to help as well. So he grabs Gwen and drops her into the clock tower.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>While holding off Harry, Peter is holding onto Gwen with a web-line, it breaks and he tries to catch her, he manages to snag her, but her neck breaks when her head hits the ground.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's acting in the scene where he cradle's Gwen's body was the best part of the film. It really made the scene work. People have argued that ""character wise, Gwen's death made no sense"", but I think they pulled it off.<br/><br/>The graveyard scene following it was great, it showed that Peter's free time over a period of several months was spent at Gwen's grave. He has given up being Spider-man. But after Aunt May tells him about putting things where they belong, Peter finally watches Gwen's graduation speech (which he missed because of Spider-man), and her words make him put on the mask and become Spider-man again.<br/><br/>The ending scene has Rhino finally making an appearance, and he is the first volunteer in Harry's group (which we all know is the Sinister Six). With no Spider-man around, Rhino feels pretty confident. A small boy dressed as Spider-man steps out to confront him, and the police are scared of trying to get him out of the way because Rhino might hit the kid when he shoots at them. Spider-man appears and tells the kid to take care of his mom, and the final shot has Spider-man in mid-attack. Many people have argued against this ending, thinking that it leaves an unanswered question. Not true, we all know how it ends. Spidey wins, roll credits. The scene worked for me because it showed that now that he was back in action, Spider-man was going to keep fighting.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie. There are a lot of bad reviews for this film, but the good ones aren't seen as much. See the movie and form your own opinion. Personally, I enjoyed this more than most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films (especially Iron Man 3)."

","But still pretty damn good. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is rich with action, suspense (even for those who are familiar with the story) color and vibrant character development. The sequel has enough fan-service with teasers and tidbits to keep us going until the third film.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is young and full of life. Easily thwarting the everyday crime that fills the streets of New York, but struggling with the promise he made to Captain Stacy in the first film. He wants Gwen and she wants him and that is not something easily buried. He is also wrestling with the demons that his parents left behind. With all of this pulling at the poor guy its a wonder he found the time and energy to deal with the villain of the movie.<br/><br/>Here's where I have a bone to pick with it: Electro; A powerful enemy who wields kinetic energy. But this villain is anything but electrifying. He whines about being unloved and unnoticed, and then turns into this blue lava lamp/jellyfish looking creature who decides to hate Spider-Man after a verse of song is sang in his head. I don't know who thought that that was clever, but it somehow made it into the movie. Harry Osborn also plays a part, and Dane Dehaan does a fantastic job of breathing new refreshing life into the boy, that is until his big reveal as yet another classic Spidey enemy. His look was somewhat Tim Burton in a very negative way. The last thing that I must critique is the over use of CGI dive and crane shots. A Spider-Man movie without them would be dull, but this director seemed to enjoy the effect so much that it is put in much too frequently and takes away from the human tale that is trying to be told.<br/><br/>Luckily, when those silly things interfere with your enjoyment of the film and threaten to be too much the story takes a turn back to romance and the chemistry between our Gwen and Peter saves the film from drowning in ridiculousness. Their love is the heart and center of the story and helps to shape Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man into one of the most sympathetic and redeeming heroes of this age of Marvel Movies. I therefore give ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" 7.4/10"
"monstermadness25","6","0","3","15 May 2014"," A sequel that raises the stakes but fails to deliver.
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a film which explores Peter Parker's struggle to cope with a double life, whether it's being Spiderman and protecting the citizens or living a normal life dealing with Gwen Stacy. Usually the advantage with a Spiderman film is that Spiderman is a hero with a high school alter ego who deals with everyday issues, such as; relationships, growing up etc. However, this film falters with that as the film spends so much time exploring Peter's father, and this fundamentally ruins the film. Firstly this turns Spiderman into a soldier set up by his father to destroy Oscorp. Secondly Aunt May becomes useless as Peter becomes more bothered about his Dad rather than May-this is disappointing as May is a really good character who adds a good complexity and importance to his life but the film is more concerned with Peter and his Dad over Peter and May.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the extremely adorable Emma Stone is back as the equally adorable Gwen Stacy and her scenes are always good to watch. Her chemistry with Garfield is amazing, which is the highlight of the film. Also the introduction of Harry Osbourne is well executed and the relationship between him and Peter is always compelling. The villains side of the story is lacking, underdeveloped and tiring. Jamie Foxx is wasted as Electro and also the need to add an extra two villains are exhausting. So overall the film succeeds in escalating the stakes but falls short of delivering a good sequel due to villains and over pumped action whilst also failing to establish the drama and human side of the film as well. Although the film is saved by Stone's cute performance which will keep us invested, despite the fact that I feel there was not enough of her. Maybe a Gwen Stacy film with Stone would satisfy us... who knows?"

","Dane Dehaan is one of the finest things that happened to this teen flick. His Goblin portrayal is breathtaking. Times when he loses it and plays rogue is a delight to watch. Electro is rad! His teleporting abilities kickass and is a joy to watch! <br/><br/>Introduction to Ravencroft is cleverly done! Same is the case with The Gentleman who is on his way to introduce Marvel's The Sinister Six. At one point we find the prototypes of Doc Ock and Vulture staring at us from a screen.

You go Aaah! at times when you realize little things like Andrew whistling the famous Spider- man theme and like when Electro plays Itsy Bitsy Spider on columns by beating the crap out of Spidey! Hans Zimmer gradually uplifts the movie too silently in the background through his beautiful music.<br/><br/>Downsides: What worries me the most is the pace of the flick. It is unbelievably fast, slows down only for the love story bit with Gwen! So we have ups and downs throughout the movie! Screenplay is sluggish too. Editing is just poor and the direction too doesn't impress much!<br/><br/>One of the best things about the movie is its adrenaline factor.

"guerrerouac","7","0","3","13 May 2014"," A step in the right direction
","This movie has many strong elements that work, despite having uneven pacing and several plot threads that lead nowhere or are barely developed (e.g. Electro's motivations as a villain, Richard Parker's story). Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone share great chemistry together as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. Their scenes together add up to one of the most funny and touching portrayals of romance seen in recent memory. Marc Webb imbues these relationship scenes with a nice visual flair and energy, as previously seen in '500 Days of Summer.'<br/><br/>The relationship between Peter and Harry (played by Dane Dehaan) was also nicely done with the few scenes they had together, but unfortunately Harry's transformation from Peter's best friend into the Green Goblin felt hasty and patched together (why was Harry so urgently pursuing Spiderman's blood as if he was dying the next day when his father lived a long life?). The same issues plague the film's portrayal of Electro. Jamie Foxx is fine in the role and fills out the character of Max with his own set of quirks but after an impressive introduction and action setpiece in Times Square, he is basically dumped to the sidelines and rarely is given the chance to grow as a character or deepen his relationship with Spiderman. By the third act, Electro is thrust back into the main action, but we don't sympathize or identify with him; he merely functions as an obstacle for Spiderman to overcome. Thus, the final action setpiece between Spiderman and Electro is visually impressive but lacks the stakes of a truly epic battle. However, the clock tower sequence at the end of the film is beautifully staged and filled with heart wrenching emotion. If only the rest of the setpieces were able to balance the tonal overlap between human drama and comic book action, the overall movie would feel more cohesive as a whole.<br/><br/>This sequel is an improvement on several fronts from the first Webb-helmed Spiderman. The action featuring Spiderman's abilities is clearly staged and well-directed (the bullet-time motif is cleverly implemented from Spidey's point of view). The villains, while based on archetypes, are at least given some screen time to develop their relationship to Peter/Spiderman before being consumed by their banal world domination plans. All of the supporting actors do fine work (especially Sally Fields as Aunt May) and help flesh out the normal everyday world that Peter Parker has to navigate when he's not slinging webs. However, I wish that all the time spent on the Richard Parker storyline actually went somewhere, instead of stalling out with Peter finding a magic subway car and being faced with vague implications of a 'conspiracy.'<br/><br/>Garfield and Stone deserve merit for fully inhabiting their characters and providing a jolt of energy to the movie's stop-and-go pacing. Their electric chemistry and natural charm illustrates the spark that was woefully missing from the Peter/Mary Jane romance in the Raimi films. Hopefully, Webb will have a better grasp on the pathos and humanity of not just the teen heartthrobs, but also the villains in the next installment."

","I'll try to make this brief, because there are hundreds of reviews. First things first: it's worth your time. It's a superhero movie from the Marvel stable, and certain things in Marvel's movies are always done well. Garfield's performance is great for Spidey.<br/><br/>Now let me tell you what I said to my friend on the way out of the theater: the storyline didn't seem tight enough. It would have been nice to have some additional depth and/or development, particularly in the case of Electro's character. What seems to have happened in this movie is the same thing that bothered me about the 3rd installment from the Sam Raimi-directed series... the script tried to take on too many different things and in the process left the viewer wanting. That's not to say the pacing was slow - it isn't - but the storyline does not evolve in a way that is easy to understand; it juggles several different subplots and suffers for it. The final battle left me wanting- wait, which final battle? This is a microcosm that explains the larger problem I think most people will have.<br/><br/>Bottom line: see it, enjoy it, and hope that in the 3rd installment there is more cohesiveness to the storyline."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","0","3","10 May 2014"," Not much of an improvement
","The film starts with a chaotic brawl on a private jet travelling to parts unknown. Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary Parker (Embeth Davidtz) are aboard the doomed flight along with an assassin yet in a moment of concentration Richard musters the ability to upload a file on his laptop before the plane vanishes. More than a decade later, Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) is chasing bad guys in a latex suit while balancing his relationship with on-again-off-again girlfriend Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone).<br/><br/>You remember Stacey from the first film right? She still works for Oscorp, an organization who once employed the Parkers as well as Dr. Connors who turned out to be a Lizard creature in the first film. You know the guy who killed Gwen's father (Denis Leary) and may have been Peter's only link to his parents until the arrival of Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) who was given control of the company after father Norman Osborn (Chris Cooper) died. Also at the beginning of the film, he's chasing a menace by the name of Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) who has stolen; you guessed it, Oscorp property. Goodness, can't Peter find anyone outside the Oscorp circle of influence? Even the star villain of this new film is an Oscorp employee; Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) aka Electro.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) offers some of the same benefits the first installment did. There are elaborate set pieces and CGI that fulfills the fevered wet dreams of the sixteen-year-olds in all of us. The story, while a little cluttered, never ceases to provide interesting fodder when things aren't blowing up at you and then there are some dead-on performances by Emma Stone and franchise newcomer Dane DeHaan. The plot line of Peter finding out what happened to his parents takes center stage in this sequel which differentiates the Marc Webb movies from the old Sam Raimi trilogy. It all feels fresh if a little too heavy handed and busy.<br/><br/>The thing is the various stories swirling around this bloated sequel could have been made into three worthwhile films. Yet with three villains and their origins to contend with, Peter and Gwen's ""complicated"" relationship, the enduring mystery of the Parkers' disappearance, the reappearance of The Gentleman in the Shadows (Michael Massee) from the first film and a Alistair Smythe (B.J. Novak) tease it's hard for anything in the film to resonate on an emotional level. If only Webb and Sony Productions learned passed lessons and didn't frontload the film with so many villains things may have turned out differently. I dare say Spider-Man 3 (2007) was a more sound film from a storytelling point of view than this Andrew Garfield helmed mess.<br/><br/>And what of our 30-year-old high schooler leading man? Well his performance is convincing as a recent high school graduate and vulnerable orphan yet as a budding genius he falls short. There are many moments of slapstick provided by our leading man's tinkering yet if he actually cracked a textbook in his life or failed that, done a Google search he'd know how to keep Electro on his toes. Then of course there's Jamie Foxx who before his transformation tries to recreate his so-so performance in The Soloist (2009) only with a bad comb over. Once he becomes Electro, his character development into unstoppable psychopath seems a bit thin. Oh and of course there's Paul Giamatti's Rhino who insists he's a killer yet looks absolutely adorable both with and without his mechanized suit.<br/><br/>There are flickers of decent ideas in this new installment of the Spider-Man saga so here's to hoping the inevitable sequel makes a mad dash for a more succinct story and convincing villains. If not here's to hoping the Marc Webb Sony movies accomplish a new nadir in superhero movies and sells the rights back to Marvel. Then we'll be able to see a real Avengers movie featuring your neighborhood friendly Spider-Man.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"alishahmohd","6","0","3","12 May 2014"," Good action flick, better than it's predecessor.
","When the Spider-man movie franchise was rebooted, I was not in favor of it, I actually was among those people who enjoyed the Sam Raimi films, regardless of the fact that Spiderman 3 did not deliver. I was actually looking forward to Spider-man 4 till they decided they had to reboot the franchise. I thought the reboot was really unnecessary. Andrew Garfield does have the younger, college boy look, more so than Toby Maguire to be Spider-man like he is in the comics and the 1994 animated series. Plus they also added more believable elements, like he used gadgets to create webbing, just like in the comics, which was far more believable than the Sam Raimi's movies. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the first film had too many mysteries too many secrets about Parker's parents which were not cleared up at all by the end, they also kind of ruined the tragic Uncle Ben scene and Garfield's acting in that situation was not good. Plus the first film dragged on and on till the lizard showed up which was too late in the film, and the love story was not developed well at all like it was in the Sam Raimi's films in my honest opinion. Plus Spiderman looked really weak in the entire film, he needed way to much help to stop the lizard. What I did like was Garfield's humorous jokes as Spiderman, specially his interactions with the lizard otherwise the movie failed to impress.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman 2 on the other hand does many things right, it first clears up what happened to Parker's parents, the reason for their sudden departure, much better scenes between Gwen and Parker. And honestly an overall interesting plot. Harry's family back-story and the Oscorp back-story is extremely interesting and I was deeply invested in his character. Jamie Fox was actually good after his TRANSFORMATION before that he just came off like an idiot or a goofy spider-man fan-boy. Electro came off as a tough and believable villain and his fight scenes against Spiderman were done very well. <br/><br/>Unlike it's prequel the film keeps me interested for most of it's duration mainly the scenes involving Electro and Harry, the interactions between Parker/Spidey and Harry were also done excellently. The climax was also good but unfortunately for me the ending was ruined on the net before I watched the film. But I still think this film also ended on a high note and I am actually interested in the sequel, and that is not something that came to my mind after watching the first film. <br/><br/>I also felt Garfield did better in the emotional scenes this time around. Emma Stone was pretty much the same like she was in the last film, Jamie Fox was great as the dangerous Electro and James De Haan was just awesome in his role. The supporting cast also did a good job. <br/><br/>The film's overall plot is good, but it is not what carries it strong performances from the main cast, regardless of cliché dialogs, the film also uses great high-tech graphics and CGI those action scenes are fantastic even better than the last film, all fight and action scenes were done well and were all fun to watch. Unfortunately the serious dialogs scenes were boring and kind of dragged on, dragging this movie down for me.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fun action that is a good watch for any Spiderman fan, but I still love the Animated Series the most. <br/><br/>Overall: 7/10"
"sreethered","5","0","3","12 May 2014"," A jumble of clichéd sequences and EFX.....
","Marc Webb's attempt to reboot Spidey from the successful Raimi franchise wasn't a bad one as everyone considers. Apart from the familiar origin story the reboot was much more rooted to the source material and much more stylish. The first-person sequences, web slinging machine, and a much more cocky Spidey was a remarkable improvement over Raimi's Spidey. But, watching the sequel, I am having a feeling that Webb could've done better. <br/><br/>First of all, the movie was a mix of all sort of things and not even a single element convinces the audience. There is romance, which is ridden with clichés. Stone and Garfield wasn't enough convincing as they were in the previous one. The opening shot which was pretty good, but doesn't gave any serious contribution to the plot. The script was so weak that it had to compensate with action. With more than enough slo-mos and destruction, the action sequences became a bi-product of 3-D effects. As a result, we got a partially structured story and characters with lots of visual effects. No wonder Chris Nolan despises 3-D.<br/><br/>Granted, there are some good moments and performances in the movie. The hint of Sinister Six and eventual death of Gwen are brave decisions from the director so that he could follow the comic's root. It could've been turned in to a better, engaging script. But instead, we have to be satisfied with this one. It could've been better than this. Way better........."

","As a Fan boy, I thought this was the best comic book movie ever. Because it really felt like I was watching a comic book. From all the Spidey poses to the new costume and the amount of villains just making cameos. The story in itself felt like it was written by everyone's favorite cameo actor, Stan Lee.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a great Spider-Man. The right built, the right banter, he even talked like a kid from queens, it was great. By far the best part of the movie. <br/><br/>The music was pretty good as well. I saw Pharell Williams straight from the Despicable Me soundtrack had a lot to do with it. The music decides to make Spider-man a little more heroic which was interesting.<br/><br/>As a Fan boy, I did kind of feel that Spider-Man's origins are getting to big and complex. I know this is a block buster but some things in the movie seem to be leaning away from the basic concept that Spider-Man is a local vigilante. He's not a globe trotting super hero like Iron man. The movie is similar to Man of Steel in which his origins drive the story and the villains he faces.<br/><br/>It's funny that some people felt that the original Spider-Man trilogy was campy and yet in this movie they made Electro very campy. I like Jamie Foxx just fine as Electro, in fact I think he does the combo of dangerous and campy very well, but like Spider-Man, they changed Electro's origin to be bigger than just a crook as if this would make him better. That's why the Rhino was my fav villain in the movie as he was just a simple criminal given awesome powers. <br/><br/>As a regular movie goer, none of this might matter to you, but that's why Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not ideal. If you are not familiar with the comic book, the large amount of villains in it and the top notch story that reflects the full on relationship of Gwen and Peter might not be worth the extra 23mins this 2hours and 23 minute movie gives.<br/><br/>I got to be honest, I like Spider-Man 2 better than Amazing Spider-Man 2 as a Fan boy it was amazing, but as a film Geek my mind has not changed about it being too soon for a reboot."

","Despite it not receiving the kindest critical reviews during its initial release, I was a huge fan of 2012's ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". A brand new re-imagining of the popular comic book story, it had surprisingly great performances and amounted to one of the most entertaining films of that year. And after being so keen on the first movie I was extremely excited to hear that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was finally going to hit theaters. It may not have lived up to my immense expectations but notwithstanding its many flaws, I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>We pick up our story with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he struggles to balance his relationship with Gwen (Emma Stone) along with his responsibility as Spider-Man. With fresh villains emerging, including an uber-cheesy Jamie Foxx as Electro and a creepy Green Goblin, he is forced to choose between his own problems and the dangers that face the city. On a much bigger scale than its predecessor, and wildly more lively, it's more of a crowd-pleaser than anything else. <br/><br/>It has various issues concerning the antagonists, but the strongest points lie in the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, who provide the most heartwarming and endearing scenes. I realize the film may not be for everyone, but I found to be charming and amusing amidst its problems. Rated PG-13 for action, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is fun but flawed."

","If the new Spider-Man could represent one thing, it would be hope; hope that Sony can deliver as Disney and Paramount Pictures have with its Marvel mammoth The Avengers cannon; hope that their reboot is a successful and advancing platform towards a very large and lucratively sinister franchise future; and hope that will restore faith in the amazing-ness in its highly popular comic book wall-crawling character after a trilogy not too long ago. <br/><br/>Spider-Man is undoubtedly a symbol of hope; a beacon of goodness; an ideal for morality. Growing up, Spider-Man was and continues to be one of my favourite comic book characters. Riding on emotion and sentiment, the web head is a fictional comic book character written as imperfectly as you and me.<br/><br/>Making his fifth entry on the big screen in just twelve years in Marc Webb's second instalment of the Amazing Spider-Man series, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is less amazing and more routine. At times, the film shines as a gemstone indie love story similar to Webb's breakout hit, then, just seconds later, becomes a highly explosive and corny PG suitable Transformers imitation. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is as confused a film as its lead human character Peter Parker, taking too many liberties with his story yet trying to stay true to the comic book character Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created over fifty years ago. Thankfully, actor Andrew Garfield suits up again and holds the emotional scenes of the film together as the wise-cracking identity confused teenager, nailing every subtle and bold Peter Parker nuance while facing off against many obstacles and three very teed off villains in what has been marketed as 'his greatest battle yet'. With the exception of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, the last of Raimi's trilogy with the character and a total train wreck, the films seem to be making a slow but steady decline in narrative, quality filmmaking and heart–and the same could be said with The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Rebooting the series in 2012 for the sole purpose of making great use of movie theatres current obsession of 3D and applying it to Spidey's first person metropolitan web-swinging, the point- of-view filming approach makes up for mere minutes of the film, usually focusing on the tormented personality of Peter Parker and the difficult choices he needs to make, as both a man and a hero, which was already visited in the first trilogy. Not that we are expecting a film to be made in the same way as the disastrous POV bomb Doom, but if the studio did decide to revisit a highly successful series only years after the first one was complete, at least make it worth while for the audience to drop the $20 for admission.<br/><br/>In the first Amazing Spider-Man film, Webb's narrative felt like a familiar story of Peter Parker with a new villain. Thankfully, the series was able to pick up massive talent with a director who flourishes in his ability to flesh out the fine chemistry between his actors as seen with 500 Days of Summer and is able to create highly emotional, gut-wrenching bonds between lovers, friends, allies and enemies. With the talented Mr.Webb behind the lens, the Amazing franchise brought Peter Parker more vividly to life with the passionate and caring Andrew Garfield, who proved on many occasions how humbled and dedicated he was highlighting a side of Peter Parker in a way that Tobey Maguire never could. His interactions with his aunt and love interests Gwen are the best scenes in the film, hands down. Kudos to Ms. Emma Stone, who brings Peter Parker's first love Gwen Stacy to life with pizazz and spunk for a second time and finally rids herself of all the Emma Stone nuances that made her performance distracting in the first film.<br/><br/>Picking up exactly where the last film left off in terms of secrets and mysteries, the film opens up to a flashback of Peter Parker's parent's disappearance. Richard and Mary Parker (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) leave New York and their son behind after double-crossing Oscorp. Flash forward nearly two decades and their son is saving the big apple in his blue and red spandex suit, one fallen fruit at a time.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting mythos behind Spider-Man is his bond with humanity and his internal struggle. Spider-Man is cocky and comical throughout the film, usually minimizing the severity of the action and violence going on around him. Meanwhile, Peter Parker is a highly emotional and tragic character whose curse lays in his inability to distance himself from the people he loves the most. Spider-Man narratives have always been about making choices, choosing paths and learning from one's mistakes. Almost all the comic book characters getting the big screen treatment have been adapting what I like to call The Dark Knight formula; a formula that allows its characters to somewhat be rooted in reality, adding a drizzle of grittiness. Spider-Man seems to be one of the few, if not only, comic book character on the silver screen today who maintains his childish, goofy and often times overly-comical approach, adding colourful hints of appropriate teenage-ness. Sadly, unlike many other famous comic book characters, Spidey's world is one that is conquered constantly by the death of others, a theme that is in no way easy to swallow for children or teenagers–making the film a topsy-turvy tonal mess.<br/><br/>One of the biggest question marks in this film was whether Gwen would make it out alive or not. Webb's film franchise introduced Gwen and allows Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) to be the sole love interest in Peter Parker's life. <br/><br/>Check out the full review at www.nightfilmreviews.com!"
"wichio","7","0","4","8 May 2014"," Some things went right, some things went wrong.
","Let just start by saying, the excessive amount of comic book movie releases lately has set the bar way higher than were it was when Sam Raimi's ""Spider Man 2"" came out.<br/><br/>I'll try not to make comparisons between both movies unless i feel the need to do so, and just to put you in some context, i like this saga better than the last one mostly based on the fact that Andrew Garfield is a better casting choice for Peter Parker than Toby McGuire.<br/><br/>It was exciting, sure, but like I said, the bar for comic book movies is higher, and we just don't settle for action sequences and cool super powers anymore. Which leads me to the first mistake: the story. Although is not the reason we watch comic book movies, it is what makes them good. Sequels are hard because it's not about the transformation, or obtaining the super powers anymore, which would steal about 45 minutes of the movie. This time we had major plot wholes just for the fact the story wasn't very well written. Harry and Peter were somehow (and I quote Peter) ""Best friends"" which the only reference we had about said friendship is a 10 minute scene were they share why they have drifted apart (which for me felt like the writers just felt obligated to write it since Harry wasn't on the first movie.) Also Harry is sick, and apparently the very existence of OsCorp is helping that kind of sickness. They never even explain what it is or how they got it, apparently it's just some kind of mutation.<br/><br/>Peter is working taking pictures of Spider-Man (of course we know that is what Peter does) but we never get a glimpse of how he got the job, or how long he's been doing this or J. Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>Apparently OsCorp is hiding big corporation secrets, but not big enough to stop people who know them. OsCorp staff spends about a 5-10 minute period chasing Gwen, but after that, they must have thought ""Meh, she already knows anyway"" because we never see what happens with this.<br/><br/>Why this happens?<br/><br/>In my opinion they spent too many time focusing on Peter and Gwen's relationship. It's like the whole movie was written around (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) Gwen's death at the end.<br/><br/>THE VILLAINS<br/><br/>There wasn't much story to tell about the villains, Jamie Fox does an excellent job playing a nerdy janitor leading you to think how does HE become such a bad ass later, and when it finally happens, it's just like he decides he's angry so he will become evil. The Office's BJ Novak's only job was just pissing him off and lowering his self stem to give Jamie Fox a reason to become the bad guy.<br/><br/>Also, what a waist of Paul Giamatti, just screaming one liners inside a huge Rhino suit, which really could have resembled any other beast in the animal kingdom, but, you know, the Rhino was a villain in the Spider-man comic books, so even if there's no reason whatsoever OsCorp had a rhino-shaped tank... Well, the suit had to be a rhino.<br/><br/>GWEN STACY<br/><br/>Probably the best element of the whole movie. Emma Stone is just so freaking enjoyable, and I am probably saying this as one of her biggest fans, but her role in the movie was great. How Gwen deals with Peter being Spiderman, and having to brake up with him, but still wanting to be her friend, it just made the whole story really human. Although the movie as a whole is not as good as the movies from The Avengers Saga (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America), Emma Stone is probably the only element that's at the same level (Comapairing her with Natalie Portman and Gwineth Paltrow). (SPOILER ALERT!!) Casting a Mary Jane to replace her now that she's dead, will be a hell of job (which Shailene Woodly would not be able to pull of, in my opinion). <br/><br/>PETER PARKER Quirky, fun, better than Toby McGuire."
"bravesfanc","7","0","4","7 May 2014"," a good sequel
","As there are plenty of reviews already on here I wont divulge into much detail and after this being out for almost 2 weeks, I would assume that most people have seen the movie already. I enjoyed it, this reboot of Spiderman is good and I enjoyed the first one as well, probably more than the sequel.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastic and shot really well. The special effects are also good especially the fight scene between Electrode and Spiderman. The main problem for me was the dialogue. It reminded me somewhat of the Twilight films...and we all know how bad those are. But Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone do there best and we get some quick comedic laughs because of it.<br/><br/>The chemistry between those two are fantastic and it really carries the movie. It's quite the bummer in the final fight scene but if you've read the comics or any article about the film in the last week, you know that Gwen dies. The way she dies is pretty graphic for a PG-13 movie but again, the cinematography was spot on for the exact moment of death.<br/><br/>Overall, if you liked the first one you will like this sequel. It's a fun action movie with a bit of a dark climax."
"oscarxp25","7","0","4","7 May 2014"," The ""Almost there"" Spiderman
","While watching ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" it is very clear why Marc Webb was given the reigns as director. When it comes to the emotional core of the story and getting performances to match those many emotions in the film he does a hell of a job. The romance between Gwen and Peter is much more believable and real than Peter and Mary Jane's in Sam Raimi's trilogy. If only the rest of the film had the precision that the love story does this film would have been a home run.<br/><br/>The film falls somewhere in the middle of something amazing and a missed opportunity. It never does get to the lows of some of the most terrible comic book movies like ""Batman and Robin"". What is most frustrating about it is that there is greatness hidden in such a bloated film where the misses outshine the hits. The first part of the movie where we are shown how comfortable Peter has fit into his role as the hero of the city while trying juggle his feelings and guilt about Gwen and the broken promise he failed to keep with her dad is where the film shines. This goes beyond Garfield and Stone being a real couple. There have been plenty of films where the two leads were a real life item but the chemistry failed to translate to the screen. Garfield and Stone are perfect for each other in this movie. They bounce off each other perfectly with all the romance and flirtatious dialogue they are given. While the romance is the strongest aspect of the film it does crutch on a bit too much at times, which in results in it being a bit too cutsey. That said, all the rest of the relationships are quite well done. Aunt May, played by Sally Field, is still a great emotional center for Peter. She provides Peter with what Uncle Ben did before he was killed. The characters growth is sold through Field's acting ability and some interesting plot points. In this film we meet the famed comic book villain Harry Osborn, who eventually becomes The Green Goblin. Even though Harry and Peter's relationship origin has been changed and is a bit underwritten; Dane DeHaan and Garfield do give off the vibe they were friends separated by life's obstacles. DeHann is sinister, cold, and a bit frightening with the limited screen time he has. It is going to be interesting what he brings us next time with more screen time.<br/><br/>That screen time is given to Max Dillion and is one of the mistakes the movie commits. Where Harry's story is full intrigue, important to Peter's life, and had the potential to be something really great, we are given an extremely clichéd and underwritten backstory to why Dillion turns evil when he becomes Electro. Where Harry feels like he could have been a great fleshed out character, Electro feels like a secondary villain. Foxx does his best, and he is good, but the character is very underwritten and seems to have no other purpose than to showcase the effects in the movie. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's confidence in this film has grown. He captures both the awkwardness and heroism that Spiderman/Peter Parker possesses. When he has that mask on he is a man that so many place their hope in for a better city. This point is nicely done at first but kind of gets overly dramatic towards the end. One thing that Garfield is great at is the legendary Spiderman wise cracks. His sarcasm and wit are so sharp when it needs to be. This is mainly because you can see Garfield loves playing the role. The bar has been set by Andrew for future actors of the role.<br/><br/>One thing I will give Webb is that it seems he embraces the fun of Spiderman this time around. Where the 2012 film was a tad serious, this one embraces the spirit of Spiderman and the fun it is to be him. Even the suit has lost the out of place dark eyes and replaced them with the iconic large white eyes. The colors of the film are more vibrant, especially when it comes to Electro's screen time. When combined with Garfield's spirit it creates a light hearted superhero film that has seemed to be lost and looked down upon ever since Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" franchise. Several points in this film will bring a slight smile to the most jaded comic book movie fans. There are times though the choice of making it lighter does backfire. Some scenes or lines come off way too corny or feel like they belong in a bad 90's comic book film. <br/><br/>For the most part though, Webb understands the balance between fun and serious. His ambitious nature does hurt the film a bit. Where some parts of the are extremely well done and you want to see them expanded, the amount of material stuffed into this film prevents that from happening. The first time Webb had to search for his own identity and found it in this film. Maybe next time he will learn to trim the fat because underneath this good film is something truly amazing. Hopefully next time we will get to see that."
"JohnPaulG07","Null","0","4","7 May 2014"," Action packed, cgi based, blockbuster
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 brings back everyone's favorite web crawler into a dastardly mess of emotional conflict, strained relationships, corporate intrigue and a new villain. There are many reasons to go see this movie not least of which is the popularity and blockbuster nature of this highly anticipated film. As a movie the plot itself stands for itself, barely but does suffice. There are also a lot of great action scenes with high quality cgi based cuts which add to the visual aesthetic of the film. Jamie Fox does an excellent job playing his role which adds to the air of the film and gives a lot of purpose to the plot which otherwise focuses on Spidarman/Peter Parker's personal life. Once you get past the lack luster nature of some of the scenes and cheesy romantic overtones you can actually dive into the characters and get a better understanding of the dark overtones behind the Amazing Spiderman series. All and all this is a must see film of 2014 and a great time if you are looking for 3D action and a highly visual experience."

And action scenes are alright not great, so where the effects. But the scenes with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are enjoyable, there scenes together really work, cause they have such great chemistry. Like I said Amusing."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","5","6 May 2014"," C'mon Webb! Hopefully this build-up is worth it for the next installment...Which won't happen
","Well this one is at least better than the first one in my opion. Although a lot of critics may disagree with me on this. However it's still a disappointing sequel that appears to be a jumbled mess. And a poor flow and editing when it comes to the story. After the credits started rolling, I just wasn't like ""man, I want to see this movie again sometime later"". It has like 3 villains, actually 2 with one being the main villain. Rhino and even Electro is very underutilized. The execution is cool, but it's just not entertaining to watch or attention grabbing when compared to ""Spider-Man 2"". As a matter of fact, I actually checked the time quickly few times in the theater. Because the whole thing seemed to drag, despite it having a lot of stuff going on in order to build up for the next installment. And I think that is one of the things made this film falter in certain areas. Because instead of it trying to be it's own movie, it tried to set up for the sequel. No, complaints if it worked but for the most part it doesn't. Electro is a bit over the top, when it comes to his development into villainy but understandable and somewhat believable. Maybe because some part of me can empathize with Electro. The chemistry between Peter and Gwen is better this time around though. Andrew Garfield seemed to have really gotten the hang of playing Spider-Man which was something I wasn't all that sure of in the first one. And there is more athletic and acrobatic Spidey moves this time around. It's more of a Peter Parker movie than a Spider-Man movie which would have been fine, if it was executed better. The CGI and the Spidey acrobatics is top notch though. I personally think if it revolves more around the person behind the costume, it has to be executed very well. Now I don't mind build up in movies, but this one just wasn't one of the really good ones. This movie just felt more like a appetizer than a full course meal when it was done and finished. There just wasn't anything that made this movie really stand out for a Spider-Man movie. It just seemed underdeveloped even for a build up for the next installment. Overall this is a alright sequel, not great but just alright. Although it lacked the heart and the soul of other superhero movies like ""Spider-Man 2"". And has quite a lot of plot- holes and far-fetched scenarios when it comes to the context of the story. I still thought it was a very watchable movie, not great but it was a decently fun ride. Oh and I am glad they decided to use the original Spider-Man costume design this time around.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"MaximumMadness","6","0","4","6 May 2014"," While certainly one of the weaker films based on the wall-crawler, and with its share of flaws, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is able to pull through. A very decent sequel.
","Marc Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is one of those movies that was destined to conjure up mixed reception from critics and fans. The key ingredients are all there. But it just doesn't quite gel together as it did in the prior film, and certainly not as well as it did to the prior film trilogy that Webb's movies serve as a reboot of. (The Sam Raimi trilogy of 2002-2007) But even when it doesn't gel together perfectly, this film is able to salvage itself and elevate itself beyond its flaws thanks to its abundant strengths.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is at an uncertain time of his life. Struggling with his feelings for girlfriend Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone), while still feeling guilt over her father's death, we see him going through the stages of make-ups and break-ups repeatedly, as he is worried his dual-life as Spider-Man could hurt her. At the same time, he attempts to re-connect with his childhood friend Harry Osbourne (Dane DeHaan), who is going through a troubled time in his life after inheriting Oscorp from his late father. These matters are made even more complex by the arrival of a new villain- Electro (Jamie Foxx), a troubled and socially awkward man suffering an unhealthy obsession with Spider-Man who is transformed by a tragic accident into a powerful being made of electricity.<br/><br/>The film has been highly criticized by many, and I will say it is with good reason. The trouble really all comes back to the script by Roberto Ocri, Alex Kurtzman and Jeff Pinkner. (With addition contributions to the story by James Vanderbilt) This movie is one of the most over- complex and over-stuffed juggling acts I've seen since, well... 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"", which yielded some similar criticism. Too much is happening in the film, causing a lot of development to go out the window. Key plot lines (of which there are many) often only have 2-3 scenes devoted to development and resolution, and it's not very satisfying. It also doesn't help that it feels like a large amount of content was cut from the film for pacing reasons. It feels like there's a lot missing here. I also think our writing team made some bold but foolish choices with how some of the plot-lines and characters are developed, and how, well, cartoonish some sequences come across. I hate to say it, but the writing sucks.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, the film is able to save itself from completely imploding from the poor writing. Yes, the film is salvaged and actually made decent and entertaining thanks to the wonderful cast, fantastic direction, competent production and top-notch visuals and action. I've always firmly believed that a flawed script isn't a death sentence... if the rest of the production is strong, weak writing can be forgiven. And this is a case of just that.<br/><br/>This cast is just plain magical. Garfield really is in his element here. I wasn't a huge fan of his performance in the prior film, but here he absolutely shines. Stone is just lovely in her portrayal of Gwen, making her so likable and so human, you'll fall in love with her almost as much as Peter has. Jamie Foxx is a lot of fun as Electro, making him tragic (albeit not necessarily in a likable way, but in a way that you can pity him) and also quite intimidating. Dane DeHaan is perfectly cast as Osbourne, giving him a lot of depth and pain, yet also a faint glimmer of light and hope inside. And supporting roles by the likes of Chris Cooper, Sally Field and Paul Giamatti are just so much fun and very well-played.<br/><br/>Marc Webb's direction is also a huge step-up. His visual storytelling is so slick and pitch-perfect for this sort of material. I wasn't sure about his earlier work, as I wasn't too impressed by ""(500) Days of Summer"", but here he shows how capable he is with handling a variety of material- from the pure emotional to the intensely action-packed. I have to say, he has particularly grown in how he directs his action, as I believe this film probably has some of the best action out of all five ""Spider-Man"" features released during the past 12 years.<br/><br/>The rest of the production is top-notch. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and even awe-inspiring at times. The set design is great. The costume design wonderful. (I wasn't sure about the new Spider-Man outfit, but it totally works on-screen) Hans Zimmer's score is a good match for the material. (And thankfully, this is probably Hans Zimmer's least ""Hans-Zimmer-sounding"" score.) And the visual effects are among the best I've seen this year.<br/><br/>I also have to comment on the 3D. I'm not a huge 3D fan. For me, it's a take-it-or-leave-it gimmick. I don't care whether or not I see a film in 3D. But this is definitely one film I'm glad I saw in 3D. While dialog and plot scenes don't benefit much from the added depth, the action sequences certainly do. During the action and web-slinging sequences, I actually felt like I was swinging along with Spider-Man, and I got that same lovely light feeling in my chest, belly and head that roller-coasters me. Easily one of the best 3D viewing experiences I've had.<br/><br/>I do think that the script unfortunately bogs the film down, and sadly makes it arguably the most flawed entry in the franchise. (And probably the second-weakest after ""Spider-Man 3"") But I cannot deny how strong all other aspects of this production are. The weak script is mostly forgivable thanks to the other elements at play.<br/><br/>I am giving ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" a slightly above average 6 out of 10. It's very flawed, but still quite entertaining. This is a web-swing of fun that is still worth taking for some fans."
"erik6767","7","0","4","6 May 2014"," Good, but squandered.
","I thought the film was good, but sadly, had a lot of it's potential squandered. The ingredients it has are great, Garfield as Peter, Stone as Gwen, etc, but due to a messy script (which was written by multiple people), it gets a lot of it's potential wasted. The main problem I had was that the romance didn't need to be all ""are we together or not?"", that's a problem Raimi's movies had. Peter and Gwen should have just stayed together throughout. Another problem was that the whole conspiracy with Peter's parents should have been dealt with in the first film. It's great that they're making Peter's parents actually matter and not be just being dead for the sake of making Peter an orphan like in the comics, but it's getting ridiculous at this point. God, and don't even get me started on the advertising campaign.<br/><br/>That said, despite having big cons, it also has bigger pros, and what it does do good (like Gwen's death for example), it does great. Had those three previous points been improved, along with a few more nitpicky things (walking Smythe? Male Kafka?) then I'd probably give the film a higher rating. I just hope that 3 improves upon this film. I want this series to succeed, and I have no doubt in my mind that Webb and everyone else on board have the potential to make it better than Raimi's series, but sadly, despite having the right ingredients, this cake is being baked by someone (SONY) with dirty hands. I'm really starting to wish that MARVEL had gotten the film rights to Spider-man. Looking at Winter Soldier, I can only muse over what could have been."
"WheelzFourReelz","7","0","5","5 May 2014"," The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a fun sequel that doesn't quite live up to its predecessor.
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a continuation of the Amazing Spiderman series, in case you didn't know (you probably already did). Peter Parker has been doing his Spiderman thing for a while, and he's pretty much pro at life. He's a famous superhero, he's graduating high school, and he's got a hot girlfriend. But then, circumstances happen. And movie happens. BEST SYNOPSIS EVER! I was looking forward to this movie. I did enjoy The Amazing Spiderman quite a bit and I was hoping the sequel would be good. It was, but the first is still better. Let's start off with some things that I liked. Andrew Garfield is the best Peter Parker that we've ever had. He's charming, he's funny, he's a good actor, and he just flat out looks like he can be Spiderman. Everyone else does a really good job, too. Emma Stone was a great Gwen Stacy, Jamie Foxx was a good Electro, and Dane Dehaan was a good Harry Osbourne. I would say Paul Giamatti was a good Rhino but we'll get to that later. The action is a lot of fun. It's fast paced, exciting, and just a thrill to watch. There's lots of punching, kicking, flipping, and electricity. You can easily tell that a lot of care was put into the action to make it look awesome and it certainly does. There is a little slow motion, but it takes such a small part of the action that it's hardly noticeable. The best thing about this movie is its look. I mean, this movie is just gorgeous. The cinematography is excellent, the city is really cool to look at, the special effects are awesome. That's really the best part of the look. The special effects. Especially Electro's electricity. Having all that electricity running through Jamie Foxx's body was just really cool to look. And when he uses that power yeah. It's awesome. However, there is a fair amount wrong with this movie. For starters, the story. Don't get me wrong; the story is good. It's written well and it follows the comics pretty well (Or so I've heard. I haven't read any of the comics. Shoot me.). But, the problem with this story (or stories, as I should say) is that there are too many. This movie suffers in the same way that ""3 Days to Kill"" suffers in which the many plot lines makes the movie look focus. At one point, Spiderman is trying to spend time with his girlfriend. At another, he's trying to find the secret behind his parent's disappearance. At another, he's trying to hide his identity from his aunt. At another, he's reconnecting with an old friend. At another, we have Gwen Stacey's side story. At another, we have Max's (Electro's ) side story. At another, we have Harry Osbourne's side story. It's just too much. Another problem I have with this movie is the same problem I have with the first Amazing Spiderman; the villains. I do think, as a whole, the villains were executed better in this movie than in the first. But, each villain has their own flaws that make them not as strong as they could be. And since there are three, I feel like I should go over each one of them separately. First off, we have Max becoming Electro. Now, when Max actually becomes Electro, he's pretty awesome. But before, he acts way too cartoony. I mean, I get it, Max is supposed to be obsessed with Spiderman, but I feel like it was overdone to the point of being corny. The delivery just took me out of the movie. Next, we have Harry Osbourne becoming Green Goblin. I think Dane Dehaan was absolutely fantastic as the character. This guy does a great job at being evil. However, I didn't care about the character. When you have this villain that pretty much drives the story like Harry Osbourne does, I want to connect with this character. That's the great thing about the first Spiderman trilogy. Before he turned, Harry Osbourne was a really awesome, likable guy. I just didn't like or care about the Harry in this movie. And then we have Paul Giamatti as the Rhino. There are so many things wrong with this. First off, the Rhino is only in this two and a half hour movie for about two minutes. He's pretty much here to set up the Sinister Six plot line, I get it, but if you're in the movie for that little and for no purpose, then what's the point? Second, the delivery is way too over the top. I get it, he's supposed to be a crazy killer, but Paul Giamatti's deliver is just so poorly done. He just looks stupid. Third, WHY THE HECK DOES THE RHINO HAVE A ROBOTIC SUIT? He's supposed to have a skin-tight rhino suit that he can never take off. I mean, the robot suit would be okay if it looked cool, but I wasn't impressed. It really just looked like it was thrown together last minute and they threw Paul's face on it. I did not like this. If you wait until the end to see what after credits clip will be here to segway this movie to the next you will be disappointed. Don't worry, there is an after credits scene, but it's just a promo for an upcoming Marvel movie. This movie is not worth staying until after the credits unless you want to see Jennifer Lawrence kick butt. Overall this was a pretty fun movie. The acting was great, the chemistry worked, the look of the movie was just fantastic, and the action was fun to watch. However, these certain setbacks prevent this movie from being a completely worthy sequel. If you walk into this movie thinking this is going to be the definitive Spiderman movie, then you will probably be disappointed. But, as it stands, I really enjoyed this movie and I wish this series the best."

","After seeing the trailer, I have to say I was a little more than excited to see this film, as were many others. I was expecting it to be a step up from its predecessor. Saying that I can tell you that it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>In The Amazing Spider-Man 2 we go into more depth about Peter's parents past, Harry Osborn is introduced, and Peter and Gwen's relationship grows evermore complicated. The two best things about this installment of the franchise is the relationship between spider-man and Gwen and the visual effects that were actually quite stunning. <br/><br/>Honestly they could stuck to one villain instead of throwing the green goblin in there just for kicks, but that did not take away from the enjoyment of the film as a whole. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie is worth watching.

"vijaylink90","7","0","4","5 May 2014"," A Good Action Packed 3 D experience for this Summer
","It was a Great action packed superhero movie especially the Action and the on-screen chemistry between the characters. Direction was pretty decent with slow motion in the action sequences and flips between high fuel action. Acting was decent too and I felt touched with the Peter/Gwen story. So what is wrong with the movie? Well, there were some events which seemed misplaced and few (awesome) scenes which were deducted to improve the pace of the movie. That is where I lost the touch with the characters. Still this movie provides some serious Action and Drama and a Bit of comedy as well. Overall, it is fun to watch Spider man flying (kind of) between the skyscrapers and Electro breaking those same buildings in a flash. Characters Peter, Gwen and Max have been portrayed well by their respective actors. Also Harry Osborne's character could have been given more time on-screen (which is also well portrayed) .This movies Action is its center of Attraction which will hit you with so many waves considering which I give it a 'Seven' out of 'Ten'."
"Pstitzinger-171-775066","7","0","4","4 May 2014"," Peter Parker Listens to Phillip Phillips...
","I went into this movie with high hopes, and don't get me wrong, it was entertaining. But no movie, especially with the campy, friendly neighborhood Spiderman, can go without flaws. I knew the main villain was going to be Electro, which I thought was cool considering 2014 is the 50th anniversary of his original publication date. Yes I'm a nerd and looked at Electro's Wikipedia page after viewing the article for this film. Anyway, awesome - a character not normally touched on. But then the film makes the same mistake as its predecessors by introducing Harry Osborne AND going so far as to make him a secondary villain for Spiderman as the New Goblin (no, not the Hobgoblin as many might think). But that's not enough, the last 15 minutes of the film introduces AND allows a final fight scene with a third villain, The Rhino. Did director Mark Webb not learn a lesson from Sam Raimi's mistake(s) with Spiderman 3? The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a fun film to go to the theatre to see. I went the extra mile and did 3D and its absolutely worth it. Believe it or not, there's a lot more going on in this movie than Spidey fighting three baddies, with an obvious setup for a Sinister Six film or franchise on the future. Peter Parker listens to Phillip Phillips... On that note and alliteration aside, check out this fun film. There's a lot of cool fight scenes, CGI web-slinging scenes, just don't let the end get to you."
"kostyantynsteblovskyy","7","0","3","3 May 2014"," As seen at Haydn Kino: The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","To define the exact genre of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" sequel might be a bit hard, as with every superhero movie and in general nearly every movie these days. So just to name a few genres included in the latest Marc Webb's Spidey adaptation, the audience will experience action, comedy, romance, crime, fantasy, drama, detective fiction and even some musical elements. Two years after the first movie, Marc Webb brings back Peter Parker/Spider-Man, portrayed by Andrew Garfield, to the big screen and tries to pack it all the above together in just 142 minutes. If he succeeds or not, is a pretty difficult question to answer, but let's give it a try.<br/><br/>While filling in the gaps of the ""dark"" secrets Peter Parker's parents left for their son, we watch the young hero trying to balance between his new life as New York's superhero, for some people still a vigilante, and his love interest, Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone, whose dead father is haunting him, because he promised to stay away from his daughter. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone deliver convincing representations of their characters and Marc Webb does great work, and lives up to other Marvel superhero movies, at least on the subject of the special effects.<br/><br/>Three villains emerge during the movie, a not-in-the-right-mind electrical engineer Max Dillon, played by Jamie Foxx, who falls into a tank full of angry laboratory eels and is turned into Electro, the main villain of the film. Electro, who has an obsession with the New York's superhero, nevertheless turns against him, as Spider-Man doesn't recall his name when they encounter for a second time. A wanna-be main villain, Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, played by Dane DeHaan, brings his eccentric acting skills on board and delivers a fine performance as Harry Osborn, which cannot be said though of his performance as Green Goblin, mainly for the reason that there is no substantial time to decide on this one. The last and the least Aleksei Sytsevich/The Rhino makes an appearance almost as long as that of Stan Lee and also tries to steal some of that sparkle from Sparkles, as Spidey calls Electro during the whole movie, making us wish they would stick at most to two names per villain.<br/><br/>Read the rest at Austrian Times/Panorama News"
"prateepray","7","0","4","3 May 2014"," Better than first part, but too much dialogues and less action.
","First of all the name is amazing spider man 2. From the name we can say that the film is about spider man. But unfortunately it's not about spider man but more about Peter. All the actors did a good job, no question in that. Marc Webb did a comparatively better job than the first film. Then where's the problem? It's Kurtzman, Orci, Pinkner and Vanderbilt. Too much pressure on story resulting in excessive talking throughout the film. I'm not saying that it should be a story-less action film, but they should understand that it's a feature film and not a TV series (they should balance between the story and action). Secondly, too many characters. There is no need for so many characters. As a result not enough space was given to any character. There was no need to bring rhino. Instead they should have given more space to harry osborn. Electro only fights twice and the duration of the fight scene is very small. Webb did a wonderful action sequence but the pressure of excess story diminished everything. And finally at the end, x men. Omg. Will they merge the two universe?"

","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [2014] <br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Review: <br/><br/>Its a HIT from my end. First of all, i was disappointed with the negative reviews which gave just 50% scores. Guys! Every movie is not ""Inception"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Would request everybody to appreciate the hard work & efforts put in to make an entertaining movie & this one was entertaining ! Nobody left the theater till the Credit rolled. Females & Kids had a blast. What else do u want in a movie when your entire family is entertained ! <br/><br/>Positives: <br/><br/>1. Crisp & Clear action scenes between the Hero & Villain. Top notch A-Level (Avengers level) VFX.<br/><br/>2. Thank God, this movie didn't had any scenes of saving the American President or a flying Passenger Plane.<br/><br/>3. Good Senti Love story <br/><br/>4. Good, True 3D Movie <br/><br/>Negative: <br/><br/>1. The story is simple & typical. A new Villain comes to destroy the city & the Hero saves them. Serious story seekers can watch the Bourne Series again ! :P<br/><br/>2. The run time"
"mugishagary","7","0","4","1 May 2014"," Disappointment!!! Spiderman web swinging is the only interesting thing!!
","Personally i went for the movie with a lot of enthusiasm after seeing the trailers that really awesome but felt very little excitement during the movie.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong some of the CGI scenes were spectacular especially the web swinging by Spiderman, aside from that the story telling was just too bland. There was no natural progression of the story as scenes felt rushed and added together last minute without allowing any connection to the characters and smooth transition of the story. Even the scenes that were meant to be funny had poor comedic timing.<br/><br/>After watching Captain America the winter soldier which which the bar high for upcoming movies, I'd say Spiderman failed to hit the mark. My advise is for you to just go and watch the web swinging, that was really cool!!!(the only reason i give it a seven)"
"idsm-cambodian","7","0","4","30 April 2014"," Good Second Installment
","Spider Man 2 is a good next installment!!! Went to an early screen and found that I left cinema thinking about how this series is going to take a downhill turn eventually, not sure if that will be the 3rd film or the 4th but it will happen; however not as bad as lets say Pirate's of the Caribbean. Jamie Foxx made a good villain with a horrible comb over! <br/><br/>I recommend seeing this film and expect great things. <br/><br/>This is just my personal review I don't want to spoil it!!! Excellent CG Quirky dialogue without over intrusive!<br/><br/>see it in 3D definitely worth it"
"3xHCCH","7","0","9","30 April 2014"," An Climax That Makes You Forget the Rest of the Film
","""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is a very long movie, lasting for two hours and a half. But as you go out of the theater, you will only remember and talk about one thing -- an ending that is so numbing that it just about overshadows everything else that happens in the film. But that is getting ahead of me.<br/><br/>In this sequel of the Mark Webb reboot of Spider-Man with Andrew Garfield as the web-slinger, we follow the story of Peter and Gwen (Emma Stone) as they graduate from college and their relationship gets complicated by Peter's sideline as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a nerdy engineer in Oscorp, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), gains super electrical powers when he falls into a tank of electric eels, later terrorizing the city as glowing blue Electro. <br/><br/>Peter finally learns the truth about his dad's (Dougray Scott) disappearance via a recorded message he found in an abandoned station. Harry Osborne (Dane DeHaan) returns to take over Oscorp when his father died, and reconnects with his old friend Peter. But as he desperately seeks out a cure for a deadly familial disease he has inherited from his father, he winds up as the Green Goblin. After all of that, we still get to see the Rhino terrorize the city before the film ends.<br/><br/>The chick-flick parts of the film really work out very well, thanks to the excellent screen chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. They had so many zippy one-liners between it was fun to watch. <br/><br/>The action parts were excellent with all the wondrous computer-generated special effects about Spider-Man's fancy web-swinging skills, to Electro's dazzling pyrotechnics which take up most of the film. DeHaan's Green Goblin appearance was just in a single short fight sequence towards the end. And Paul Giamatti's turn as the mechanized Rhino was only a glorified cameo at best in the epilogue.<br/><br/>The whole angle about Peter's dad Richard, while undoubtedly of great dramatic importance, I felt was out of place in the whole film in terms of story-telling, unnecessarily making the film feel too long and over- stuffed. Whatever Peter found out about his dad did not seem to matter at all when it comes to the events in this film.<br/><br/>Overall though, I felt that while this was a good film, it just tried to tell a lot of stories, getting carried away with too many ongoing story lines. Ultimately, it was buoyed up by the wonderful central performances of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, which sets it apart as more than just a mere CG- effects- extravaganza. Their effective portrayals of these two lovers gave this film a lot of depth and heart."

"vistheindian","7","0","8","29 April 2014"," Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>In this sequel Spider-Man struggles between his superhero obligations and desires as Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield). Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a lonely electrician turns into Electro following a freak accident, and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) in pursuit of curing himself of a disease turns himself into the infamous Green Goblin. Spider-Man now confronts far superior foes that not only threaten his city but also the ones he loves. This sequel has many things right such as Andrew Garfield's embodiment of Spider-Man, his interactions with the supporting cast, the action packed fight sequences, etc. Despite all the positives, the focus on multiple villains prevents this film from being one of the best superhero movies to just being a good movie.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>There is a lot to love about this movie that I thought was done better than all other Spider-Man films before. The very first shot of the film is Spider-Man web slinging through New York City, and you can see how exhilarating it is to fly and swing like him between skyscrapers (especially in 3D). That plays into the action scenes as well, which are very well choreographed and gorgeous to see. The character interactions between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and the rest of the characters such as Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), and Aunt May (Sally Field), are very natural and truly heartfelt. Credit for that should also be given to director Marc Webb, as he has always been great at showcasing these personal interactions in all his movies. The one thing that nobody will argue is that Andrew Garfield has solidified himself as the definitive Spider-Man and Peter Parker in this film. From his quick wit, movement, and teasing of the villains, to even small things like getting excited by a little kid's science project, it is just perfect. He doesn't just portray the character, he embodies it. Andrew Garfield is Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a lot to love, but the few things that did irked me, I really did hate. The brunt of that hate goes towards the use of multiple villains. The marketing for this film shows that there are three villains Rhino (Paul Giamatti), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan). The reason all these villains are placed there is simple: setup for the next films of the franchise. Rhino is literally there for 3 mins, you have seen all his scenes in the trailers. Same goes for Green Goblin, as he is just shoehorned into a fight scene. So that leaves Electro as the main villain of the movie, one of the most uninteresting one-dimensional villains in comic book movie history. I can't blame Jamie Foxx for that because that is what the character is even in the comic books, someone who has been neglected his whole life and just wants to feel needed and loved. What I would have liked is to completely remove Electro and just focus on Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. As I mentioned before Harry and Peter have great chemistry and if their friendship and differences was fleshed out more, it would have made for a more compelling villain. Honestly, the Green Goblin as he is in this movie, even with his little screen time, had more gravity and significance than the main villain Electro.<br/><br/>I know I went on bit of a rant on the villains, but it is just something I need to address. I don't use the word ""love"" lightly, so when I say there are things that I loved about this movie I truly mean it is excellent. It is because of these positives that I recommend watching this movie. You will have an enjoyable time despite some of the things that were disappointing."
