","After the Scream phenomenon, it was only natural that a sequel was in the works. While most slasher sequels tend to be a let down and not live up to their first by having a ridiculous premise or not having the needed characters, Scream 2 is entirely different. This sequel was excellent, and lived up to the first Scream perfectly, when I did not think it would on first viewing. I mean, I was expecting it to be good, but not as good as it was. It's premise was wonderful, and the characters are amazing, because it has all the characters, that aren't already victims, from the first and more that are just as fun. All in all, it was a joyous outcome.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is not afraid to kill off whoever it wants to, like the one before and after it, even though that one does not have as many fans as the first two. It has some new twists, and the execution style is just as professional and cunning as the first. It keeps you totally entertained and the performances are just as fun. While of course it is not as good as the original, it is pretty close, I must say, and that of course is an accomplishment in itself. <br/><br/>After the events of Woodsboro, California, Sidney and Randy soon realize that a killer is on the loose again, this time at the college they are attending in Ohio. Dewey arrives on the campus to once again protect Sidney, and she and Dewey have an unwelcome reunion with Gale. How pleasant, we have all our old friends back, and the cast pulls out all the stops with their characters like they did in the first. It's still gritty and bloody, and it's also loaded with lots of nice material matter. I do not understand why it is not as appreciated as it is, regarding the rating mostly. Scream fans and horror lovers were all pleased with this movie when it came out, so I have heard, and I was as well."
"jellyneckr","Null","49","62","10 June 2005"," A pretty good sequel
","In addition to becoming the first major box office hit for Dimension Films, 1996's SCREAM also became the horror film that would set the tone for the other horror films of the late 1990s. It was a phenomenal achievement in the horror genre so of coarse a sequel was just around the corner. The most common rule with movies is that sequels are terrible and while that is normally always true, that isn't the case with SCREAM 2. It should be noted that SCREAM 2 came out just a year after the original SCREAM. Most often when sequels come out a year after their predecessor, they turn out to be pretty bad (CHILD'S PLAY 3 for example). SCREAM 2, while not as good as SCREAM, manages to be an effective and well made sequel that surprisingly is just as clever as the first one and it contains the same kind of great dialogue the first one had as well. It helps that SCREAM 2 has most of the same cast members as the first one too. I think it's safe to say that SCREAM 2 was one of the better sequels of the 1990s. I'm giving it 7/10. Recommended for fans of horror."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","46","58","4 March 2008"," Wonderful sequel that is the perfect bedfellow for the first film.
","I'm just not buying into the bad rating for this film, in 1996 Wes Craven's Scream reinvigorated an ailing genre and got fans back into the horror groove. The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.<br/><br/>Sidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...<br/><br/>The film's opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.<br/><br/>This is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10"
"ivo-cobra8","10","84","111","18 February 2018"," Flawles but yet enjoyable horror slasher sequel flick
","Scream 2 is flawless but enjoyable sequel it is not better than the first one but much way better than part 4. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson does return for this sequel but still I enjoy the third one much way more. The second sequel was good little different mixed with action and humor, but it wasn't that scary to me. It is really a step down from the first film. I have a lot of problems with this film. <br/><br/>The bad: The writer Kevin Williamson copied the first film why would they copy the first film? I don't get it. The film looks like the same as the first movie, first the name of the town was Windsor like in the first movie Woodsboro: Then the victims were killed whit the same names and surnames the same emo from the first killer. Than was a copy killer on the loose and than they were like two killers just one wants to get away, the other wants to get caught. Deputy Sheriff David Arquette as Dewey Riley did do nothing in this movie and he was useless in this film! He was complaining, yelling and did do nothing, he was slashed but yet again he survived, how did he survive? or why is he in this movie is yet beyond me. Kevin Williamson wrote his character dull and awful. Marco Beltrami copied and stole the theme music score from Hans Zimmer music score for Broken Arrow (1996) John Woo film. The humor I didn't like in here and I didn't like they were talking about Stab fictional movie in this film that was based on Scream film. Jada Pinkett Smith was in the beginning in this film and she was terrible. Most of the characters in this film are awful. <br/><br/>The good: I love the ghostface killer in this movie and he doesn't use so much scary movies questions like in the first movie, he simply kills fast his victims. I love Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott she was lovely, such a sole survivor, such a bad-ass even more sexy than in the first film. Her ass was sexy, man o man she was hot! I fall in love with her, I did enjoy her performance as Sidney. I enjoy Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers this time she had a different hair cut but she was still good in her performance as a nosy tabloid reporter. The most hero I enjoy in this movie is Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary he is awesome!!! A true real hero he is excellent! I really did enjoy the plot twist and his character. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Casey ""Cici"" Cooper is in here she is really good and Timothy Olyphant as Mickey from Live Free or Die Hard is in here! The cast work really well. <br/><br/>8/10 It is a good slasher horror movie and a good sequel to the first one I still watch this films, I like this film and the trilogy. I like the song ""She Said by Collective Soul excellent song. My third favorite film in the series but still a good one, doesn't deserve the hate."
"cathylr","7","6","6","9 November 2018"," An acceptable sequel
","While Scream was rather targetting a teenage audience, this one clearly is. It is more satiric, lighter, and overall funnier than scary. While the end of the first one was rather believable, this one is far-fetched, which is probably voluntary. Teenagers should have a good time around a beer and a pizza."
"rbverhoef","6","48","71","13 December 2003"," Pretty good sequel
","The funny thing with 'Scream 2' is that it's not as entertaining and good as 'Scream' but with bad movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legend' it's kind of a relieve. Probably the difference here is that Wes Craven is  a director who knows what he is doing.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell as Sidney, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Jamie Kennedy as Randy return for this sequel. New possible subjects or suspects are Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Hallie (Elise Neal), Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), former suspect Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was in prison for a year, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and reporter Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) who is a big fan of Gale.<br/><br/>The movie opens in a theater. The movie 'Stab' is showing for the first time and this movie is based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' by Gale Weathers. In 'Scream' Sidney predicted that Tori Spelling would probably play her if they would ever make a movie about those events and in 'Scream 2' we learn she was right. It is one of the many funny little things. Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps are killed during the showing and of course the movie is blamed.<br/><br/>From here it is like 'Scream'. The guessing can begin. Again it is a lot of fun, again the movie knows that it must not get too serious, again I was entertained by what I saw. 'Scream' was original and therefore better, more entertaining and more surprising in the way the subject was handled. Still, with all the inside jokes and references this is a lot of fun and a lot better than almost every other movie in the genre."

","Dare me to say it? ...THIS MOVIE WAS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL! <br/><br/>Ha! There goes my ""useful comment"" rating!<br/><br/>Not many movies beat their originals, especially in the horror genre. However, Scream 2 proved them wrong.<br/><br/>Sidney has gone to college and moved on with her life after the events of Scream. However, the murders and famous ""ghostface killer"" have followed too. <br/><br/>Sidney, Dewey, Gale, Randy, and Cotton all return from the first film. But we also get an interesting new group of people: Hallie, Derek, Mickey, Cici, and Debbie the reporter, who is actually more annoying than Gale.<br/><br/>We also have a higher body count, more gore, more interesting kills, and a much better ending (in my opinion).<br/><br/>I recommend this to fans of the original movie. 8/10."
"Xophianic","9","15","20","6 February 2000"," Better than the first!
","I really enjoyed SCREAM because I thought it was a very original horror movie. I liked SCREAM 2 for the same reason. The story line is pretty much the same as in SCREAM, but I thought the acting, characters, and death scenes were all better.<br/><br/>Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has gone off to college to become and actress. Now that she has left her past behind her, she is doing better. She has a new best friend/roommate named Hallie (Elise Neal), a new boyfriend and a new life. But when somebody starts killing people in the same style of the killer, Sidney finds out that her past has come back to haunt her. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), old prime suspect proven innocent of the murder of Sidney's mom from SCREAM, returns to try and get publicity for his part in all of this. Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) returns as the movie expert and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) return to try and protect Sidney.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty much the same as SCREAM, but instead of poking fun of horror movies, they poke fun at sequels. When the college students argue about whether sequels can be better than the original, it's priceless.<br/><br/>The acting is even better in this movie than in SCREAM. Neve Campbell does her usual teriffic job. David Arquette and Courtney Cox are even better in SCREAM 2 than they are in SCREAM. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jada Pinkett are the equivilant of Drew Barrymore in SCREAM. They both do fair jobs, especially Sarah. Liev Schreiber and Jamie Kennedy do great jobs, and Roger L. Jackson returns at the bitchin' phone voice. (By the way, in a movie full of the biggest teenage stars of today, Joshua Jackson has a good cameo.)<br/><br/>The character development is even better in SCREAM. You will, once again, find yourself screaming at the characters to run and get away. Sidney and Gale are just as cool as they were in the first one. Dewey and Randy are both extremely better characters in this one than in SCREAM. In SCREAM, Randy was annoying and an almost pointless character. In SCREAM 2, he's my favorite. The addition of Cotton Weary in this movie is suberb.<br/><br/>I thought SCREAM 2 was better than SCREAM. Most people will think it is just as good or almost as good as SCREAM. If you didn't like SCREAM, don't bother watching SCREAM 2. But if you, like me, enjoyed SCREAM, this is a must-see."
"a_chinn","7","4","4","30 December 2018"," More of the same self-relative horror, enjoyably balances mock and slasher film goods
","Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson re-teamed for this unneeded but entertaining sequel. Also returning is a majority of the original cast (Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Liev Schreiber), where the story picks up two years later with Campbell attending college when a new killer dons the Ghostface mask and stalks her and her college pals. As with the first film, everyone is a suspect and most importantly the film strikes a nice tonal balance of mocking slasher film conventions while also delivering the slasher film goods. Jamie Kennedy's video store clerk, now a film school student, at one point explains the rules for horror sequels, stating ""there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to create a successful sequel. Number one: the body count is always bigger. Number two: the death scenes are always much more elaborate - more blood, more gore - *carnage candy*. And number three: never, ever, under any circumstances, assume the killer is dead."" and ""Scream 2"" delivers on all three of these points. Besides meeting those sequel requirements, Craven is a master of suspense and shock and as with the first film, for a mainstream picture, he does deliver a shockingly rough horror film. Craven actually had to submit eight different cuts to the MPAA before getting an R-rating, so there's no mistaking that this film was from the same guy who made ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes."" The film is also immensely helped by a strong cast of new characters that include Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Sarah Michelle Gellar (interestingly playing a helpless blond character-type, the antithesis of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which she was playing at this same time), Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell, Laurie Metcalf, Rebecca Gayheart, an unrecognizable Portia de Rossi, and the great David Warner in a small role as a drama teacher. Best of all are the very funny cameos for the movie-within-a-movie ""Stab,"" where Heather Graham plays the Drew Barrymore part form the first film and Tori Spelling & Luke Wilson play Campbell and Skeet Ulrich's parts (an inside joke from the first film where one of Campbell's friends asks her ""If they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?"" and she answers, ""With my luck, they'd cast Tori Spelling.""). Look fast for a before-he-was-famous Adam Shankman as a Ghost Dancer and Selma Blair has an uncredited appearance (or is heard) as Gellar's friend on the phone. Also, the film was edited by Patrick Lussier, who'd later go on to direct the solid ""My Bloody Valentine"" remake, Nic Cage's ""Drive Angry,"" and was co-writer on under appreciated Terminator sequel ""Terminator Genisys."" My main complaint about the film is that Williamson's script hasn't aged all that well, seeming at bit too clever for itself, reminding me in many ways of the endless Tarantino wannabes of this era, where pop culture references were lazy substitutes for good dialogue, interesting characters, or original stories. Still, while this sequel basically covers the same ground of the first film, it's a strong cast with a talented director making a big budget slasher film, which is not something horror fans are treated to very often. FUN FACT! Robert Rodriguez (""Desperado"" ""Sin City"" ""Machete"") directed scenes of ""Stab"", the movie-within-a-movie."

"MaxBorg89","7","20","31","14 April 2007"," Still fun, but less clever than the original
","How do you make a sequel to a horror film whose whole plot was made of in-jokes and film references? Easy: make the follow-up even more in-jokey and self-referential than its predecessor. This formula actually seems to work for Scream 2, at least in the first two acts.<br/><br/>The prologue is arguably a masterclass in self-irony: an African-American couple (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett Smith) go to a movie theater where a new horror film, called Stab, is screening. This flick is based on Gale Weathers' (Courtney Cox) book The Woodsboro Murders, which recounts the events of the first Scream. As the movie begins, Smith's character complains about Stab being a film ""with no black people in it"" (just like Scream was), and, predictably, this leads to the two African-Americans being brutally murdered as the film-within-a-film's prologue (with Heather Graham replacing Drew Barrymore) is shown on the screen, so that the fictional and real deaths occur almost simultaneously. From there on, things take the usual turn: the media go crazy about the killings and once again Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is in the spotlight, as she and her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy) must protect themselves from the new foe, who is apparently mimicking what happened in the past (an obvious reference to the first film's ""Movies don't create psychos"" line).<br/><br/>The main charm of the original Scream was its ability to almost seamlessly combine clever in-jokes and a believable plot. This time around, the in-jokes are the best thing in the movie, while the story, particularly in the overblown conclusion, suffers from merely repeating key scenes from the first film. Now, this might be a satire on the lack of originality in most horror sequels, and it would work if the characters were developed correctly. Sadly, such a thing doesn't happen, with Sidney being reduced to the usual girl who keeps running and screaming (fitting, huh?) and everyone else (including Liev Schreiber, who gets more screen-time in the sequel) playing stereotypes, with the exception of David Arquette, very likable as the nice cop again trying to solve the case, and Kennedy, who has a great time stating the rules to follow in a sequel.<br/><br/>Ironically, the movie's funniest scene has a bunch of film students discussing follow-ups that are better than the originals. And while few could have anything bad to say about Aliens, Terminator 2 or The Godfather: Part II, it must be said that Scream 2, while fun and watchable, most certainly doesn't have the same sharpness that made its predecessor an above-average horror film."
"Screen_Blitz","7","3","3","14 September 2015"," Clever follow-up to Wes Craven's horror franchise
","Wes Craven gained respect of horror fans with his 1996 hit slasher hit Scream, a film that reignited the slasher-horror genre with its originality and self-awareness. The following year, Craven continued the story of the masked killer with this entertaining sequel that continues the story. Neve Campbell reprises her role as Sidney Prescott who is now in college, and is dating a handsome heartthrob named Derek (played by Jerry O'Connell). Jamie Kennedy also reprises his role as Randy Meeks, the film-geek who's remained friends with Sidney after the events from the first movie. This film follows a copycat killer that is on the loose and taking the lives of others on college campus. Sidney must team up with her boyfriend Derek, and Randy, along with Gale and Dewey who also make their return from the first film, to survive against the killer's onslaught.<br/><br/>As this film is a sequel, there are quite a bit discussions between characters about sequels and what they are all about. Like this film, these characters are very self-aware of the strategies of surviving against a killer in a horror movie, and the script makes very clear. While this one may not level up the previous film, it still remains as original and thoughtful as the previous film came out to be. It still contains the scares, suspense, and bloodshed by the Ghostface killer, and the wittiness of writer Kevin Williamson's script. It also pays a good homage to classic low-budget slasher horror films from the 80s like Splatter University, Slaughter High, and and Graduation Day. Liev Schreiber makes an interesting appearance as Cotton Weary who was the accused suspect of Sidney's mom's murder in the last, and is released from prison after proved not guilty. Neve Campbell remains good as ever as Sidney, and the rest of the cast including Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, and Elise Neal are great as well. <br/><br/>Could this movie have done better? Sure. But overall, this movie did not dissappoint me. This movie is one of the few horror movie sequels that manages to level relatively close with its original, and shows while Wes Craven is such an amazing horror director."

","Scream (1996) was a wittily postmodern recasting of slasher films of the early 1980s like Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980) and their endless horde of imitators. On one level Scream was filled with all the shocks and thrills expected of it. Yet there was another whole level to it which at the same time was consciously crafting a film that was slyly mocking and parodying its own genre and cliches. Characters stopped in the middle of the flight from the slasher to hold discussions about what characters in slasher films did in the situation and which type of character was supposed to survive according to the slasher movie formula. And following Scream's success, what more natural to follow it up with than a Scream 2, which gleefully launches into satirizing the pandemic of sequels that followed most slasher films in the mid-1980s.<br/><br/>The plot follows on from the first; Sidney Prescott and fellow survivor Randy Meeks are attending a film and theatre school, while Gale Weathers is releasing a film based on the events of the first film (which hilariously parodies the first films opening) called Stab. However, at Stab's opening, two people are found dead, after being killed by a man in a Munch mask. Now Sidney is caught up in her very own sequel.<br/><br/>The film has a fabulous opening that perfectly encapsulates the joyful sense of meta-fictional play that screenwriter Kevin Williamson delights in - while watching a film based on the events of the first film (wherein the opening of the first film is replayed but amusingly satirized - one scene rather funnily digs at directors that like to quote the Psycho (1960) shower sequence) a copycat killing takes place in the theatre where the victim's death throes are just taken to be part of the promotional gimmick for the film. Here the constant blurring of the lines between what is happening and `the artificial' is dazzling. And this naturally segues into a typically Williamson-esque debate on whether someone is trying to 'create' a sequel to the events of the first film, whether some sequels are better than their originals - you know it's a real genre fan writing when someone argues the merits of House II: The Second Story (1987) over House (1986) - and whether the media influences violence.<br/><br/>But unfortunately for Scream 2 the film that ends up on screen sadly fails to meet the criteria it itself establishes for worthwhile sequels. Williamson's script is far too burdened down and overweighed by the necessity of trying to turn the survivors from the first film and most of the cast members into potential suspects and as a result the jokey genre interplay that essentially made the first film gets lost. There is the odd moment - the script even parodies its own catchphrase from the first film: `What's your favourite scary movie?' the stalker asks Jamie Kennedy. `Showgirls - now that was a truly scary movie.' And the ending wherein the slasher explains their motivation - that they want to be caught so they can demonstrate the case for movies influencing violence in real life - is positively ingenious. But such an ending is ruined by Williamson placing so many successive twist revelations on top of that that the moment topples over into the farcically absurd.<br/><br/>Indeed, the film contains genuine tension; the vague reconstruction of Casey Becker's demise is very scary, and a scene where Sidney and her friend are trapped in a police car with an unconscious killer is exceptional.<br/><br/>However, Scream 2 tries too hard to be clever and witty, instead of just getting on with it.<br/><br/>Verdict - While Scream 2 is quite scary, and has some hugely inventive sequences, it gets too caught up with parody and clever-clever remarks. ***"

","This second ""Scream"" isn't nearly as original as the first which was a great and suspenseful take on slasher films. This one has the high school victim in the first film - Sidney - now in college studying film. For 99% of the people who major in this, a slow descent into obscurity and realizing that your life will be spent as an admin or working retail, not as a great director, should be revenge enough for anybody. But obviously our killer(s?) is/are not that patient.<br/><br/>The beginning is tight, at the opening of a film called ""stab"", patterned after the murders in ""Scream"", and you just know who the first two victims are going to be, although Craven's direction and the score make it a suspenseful when and where. The ending is good too, and it is different enough from the ending of the first Scream that you do wonder who is up to what, just like in the first. There are some tells though. There are some particularly - at that time - famous players in the film doing bit parts. Why? I'd say, watch and find out. Fortunately, this film was made 22 years ago so you are probably not going to know who was famous then and who is now because of subsequent events unless you are over 50.<br/><br/>The worst part is the middle. It is tedious. You've just got some predictable chases and cat-and-mouse games going on, and you feel like it is just there to fill time between the suspenseful beginning and end. Probably worth your time if you run across it, and probably you are not going to enjoy it if you haven't seen the original Scream first."

","Wes Craven is back again at the helm of Scream 2, his followup to the mega-successful Scream. As sequels go, one could do a lot worse than this film. Sure, it has a pretty silly story trying desperately to cling to the original source material, but it never ever takes the story too terribly serious. How does Craven do this? He laces the film with all kinds of film references and humour directly tied to the film industry and actors involved. Several mentions of ""Friends"" cast members abound whilst having Courtney Cox return in her signature role as Gail Weathers. Craven also brings back the rules to horror films - now horror sequels; these rules are right on mark too(wish we had heard the most important!). In fact my favourite scene in the whole movie is in a classroom where students debate the inferior sequel to the superior original. Excellent examples are given to support one argument that sequels are better: Aliens and Terminator 2, and of course, The Godfather 2. Naturally this small cross section seems great when none of the hundreds of truly bad sequels are mentioned. Purposely I am sure! Is Scream 2 better than Scream? No way. It doesn't have nearly as much punch to it. The opening scene this time takes place in a movie theater, but it is not as powerful as the opening scene with Drew Barrymore in the original. The story is really something unto itself as well...but any kind of examination of plot other than a cursory one would give too much away. Not that that would be any great pity. I did like the acting in this one more. Arquette returns as Dewey affecting some kind of limp and pinched nerve in hand. He does a fairly nice job. Cox is lovely as ever and also is good in her role. Campbell is OK, as is the rest of the cast with Jamie Kennedy again standing out as nerdy movie maven Randy Weeks and, in particular, Liev Screiber doing a wonderful job as Cotton Weary(the man who had been accused of killing Sidney's mama). This sequel has more blood, more deaths, and more jokes. Like the original, I too enjoyed this film for its entertainment value if nothing else."

","Watching horror movies is one thing, but surviving them is another and Scream 2 sets the bar higher, and to be honest it should have ended here. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson take it to high gear this time around. It's a lot less subtle and more in your face, which is a nice change of pace compared to the first film, cause you cannot do what you did in the first movie. <br/><br/>Like the first film, it's hilarious with the self-aware characters and the jokes that come with it, but it still takes the kills very seriously. Craven and Williamson keeps the guessing game going and it still makes us wonder who the damn killer is. <br/><br/>The main players, Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy are back. What makes this Scream special is that the cast is likable, perhaps in my own opinion a little more likable than the original. The last two don't have any characters that are as likable as first Scream and this sequel. All the cast are great. Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, Elise Neal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liev Schreiber, etc. They all come to play and bring their A-game. <br/><br/>You also feel for most of the cast. The script has fun making Derek, played by Jerry O'Connell a potential suspect. The film show's Sidney's rightful paranoia, like the little moments where Derek offers her a seat and she sits next to Timothy Olyphant's character Mickey. You can't help but maybe feel a little sorry for him, but yet ponder if he is behind all the killings. Williamson does a great job juggling all these characters. <br/><br/>What I respect about Scream 2 is that it doesn't play it safe at all. It takes risks and makes no apologies. They kill off, who is arguably the most popular character in the series Randy Meeks. It takes balls to do that, but I'm glad they did. I love Randy, but his death just made Scream 2 that much more unpredictable and immediately the stakes are much higher. They didn't play it safe. Props to Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven. Some may ponder that Sidney and Randy were destined to be together, and probably should have died in the third film while they end up as a couple, but even if that may have been cool, killing him off in this sequel makes everything unpredictable and makes a bigger shocking impact. <br/><br/>Speaking of impact, the killer reveals are quite a surprise. Mickey(Olyphant) was expected, but Craven and Williamson do a nice homage to Laurie Metcalf's Mrs. Loomis, Billy's mother. Breaking a rule of a serial killer typically being a male, as well as tributing other female killers in cinema, particularly Mrs. Voorhees from the Friday the 13th franchise.<br/><br/>The first Scream is game changer, but in the second film, it solidified Sidney Prescott being poison. If you're friends with Sidney you die, like poor Randy Meeks. You would think all the main players are safe, but they're not, at one point you even think Dewey is toast. You just don't feel safe for anyone else, and what I love is that it spoofs itself, cause Randy's argument is that sequels, especially sequels to horror films are garbage, ironically making Scream 2 being one of the few horror sequels that is considered to be worthy compared many atrocious horror sequels that killed the genre. It's meta, even before people knew what meta was.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The Plot line = 2 years after the horrific events in Woodsbrough Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) attempts to try and move on with her life by attending college along with fellow survivor Randy (Jamie Kennedy) but yet again there's another killer whose after Sidney's blood, after two college students are murdered while attending the premiere of ""Stab"" which is based on the events of the first movie and after that Sidney starts experiencing deja vu when the killer starts stalking her and taunting and as the body count begins to get higher and higher Sidney realises she's next can she survive again or will she end up dead.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is everything a sequel should be more gore and a higher body count and plus yet again a long list of suspects. To be honest this was one the sequels I was looking forward too and gladly it didn't disappoint me. It still managed to keep the intensity and humour the first one did, the first Scream was like a tribute to 80's slashers and was quite frankly much better than them all and Scream 2 is a tribute to the 80's college slashers and again better than all of them put together.<br/><br/>The characters themselves really made the movie as well the ones who came back are the lovely level headed Sidney (Neve Campbell) back, my fave Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the horror movie film buff who sadly doesn't get enough screen time, Dewey (David Arguette) the lovable silly policeman and the bitchy but sexy Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) who all come back but will they survive this time. We also get a host of new characters such as Dereck (Jerry O' Connell) Sidney's new boyfriend and possible suspect remember the first one could history be repeating itself, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) the freaky Tarantino film student, Hallie (Elise Neal) Sidney's roommate and new best friend, Cotton Weary (Liev Shreiber) who appeared briefly in part one who got accused of killing Sidney's mother but was wrongly accused and could may well be out for revenge and lets not forget fellow scream queen Buffy er no sorry I meant Sarah Michelle Gellar looking gorgeous as ever in her few short lived minutes as one of the victims.<br/><br/>The kills in this movie are cool, the suspense is there We also get lots of cameos (you spot them), a great phone conversation between Randy (Kennedy) and the killer and even a few nods Friday The 13th's way. But overall, this sequel rocks.<br/><br/>The acting Neve Campbell is brill as always, David Arquette is lovable, Jamie Kennedy didn't get enough screen time, Courteney Cox is even sexier and bitchier in this one and gets yet another slap from Sidney. Jerry O' Connell did fine although a bit dull but still likable, Timothy Olyphant has great hair and has fun, Elise Neal was OK but not very interesting, Liev Shreiber to be honest I found that there was really no need to fetch his character back because he didn't bring anything new or exciting to the movie, Sarah Michelle Gellar is stunning as always, Laurie Metcalf truly shines although not until towards the end, Jada Pinkett well I was surprised to see her in this but does fine as one of the first victims and Omar Epps is cool but gets killed way too fast.<br/><br/>All in all Craven does well again, injecting the suspense scenes with lots of tension, the film is definitely a worthy follow up and well and truly has it's moments and also I loved the cheesy twist ending."

","For most of its running time, this sequel to the surprise juggernaut it just as original and clever as its predecessor. Like the first movie deconstructs slasher conventions, this one dissects sequels - and more specifically, horror sequels - and it's a pleasure to see how screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven play with audience expectations without sacrificing logic for cheap scares. Same as with the original, the opening sequence is a stroke of demented, gleeful genius, and the same ""anything can happen"" vibe carries throughout the movie. Unfortunately it goes off the rails during a well-written but ludicrously over-acted finale that irrevocably damages the movie's momentum, but getting there, it's a strong, unpredictable and entertaining classic in its own right."

"skybrick736","8","2","2","21 June 2016"," Scream 2 (8/10)
","The genius of Scream 2 is the callbacks and homage it pays to former horror sequels and to the original Scream. Scream is iconic for its self-reflection, its placement in the horror genre, and the rules, which horror movies abide by. My own set of rules to a great sequel differ than the film. The rules are simple but are sadly not achieved as often as they should be. First, continuity, have a story that follows the events from the original or just limit the plot holes and have it be logical. Scream 2 passes the first rule with a big check-mark. Second, bring back major players, which Scream 2 exceeded at by starring Neve Campbell (Sidney), David Arquette (Dewey), Courteney Cox (Gale), Jamie Kennedy (Randy), and Liev Schreiber (Cotton). The third and final rule is a trickier concept to handle by filmmakers, which is maintaining the same atmosphere that made the original fantastic but to steer the story in a new direction. Wes Craven fulfilled all these rules, especially the third by preserving the character's personality, comedic moments, music theme, film style, and general mood and feeling of the film. Craven also connects the dots perfectly beginning to end on killer identity and motive and concluding with a satisfying ending. For all the reasons above, if I was in a film class and had to name a sequel that surpassed its original, one that would definitely come to mind is Scream 2."
"Mileskolehmainen","9","2","2","10 November 2014"," Slightly better than the original
","I am very surprised at the three star rating on here. Rotten Tomatoes (a website that's not a fan of sequels) gave this a (slightly) better rating than the first (Scream: 78%, Scream 2: 81%, it's not much but still.) This is a sequel that won't disappoint, it's still very clever, and a tad better than the original. The characters, new ones and survivors, are well acted and likable. The scares and chase scenes are very effective, and I'm sure you will find yourself at the edge of your seat in many scenes, and you're gonna jump a lot too. The script is pretty great also. The twist (and the rest of the film too) pack many surprises. So, if you haven't seen Scream 2, and are a fan of the first Scream, I recommend this movie to you. 8.8/10 (P.S. don't look at the IMDb page for Scream 3 if you haven't seen this one, it will (obviously) tell you who survives this movie)"

","After moving to college to remove herself from her past, a woman and her friends find themselves the target of a copycat killer intending to seek revenge for her previous activities and must stop the hooded-figure's rampage.<br/><br/>A fairly worthy sequel, and one that actually has a fair deal going on with it that makes it superior to the original. One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."

","I really enjoyed the first film due to its shock value and the terror and suspense it created, but 'Scream 2' kind of failed to impress me as well. The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances."
"rebecca-ry","7","2","2","31 May 2012"," A Worthy Sequel
","'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. <br/><br/>It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie cliché's and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. <br/><br/>The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. <br/><br/>Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film."

"laika-lives","9","2","2","7 April 2006"," Not Quite The Godfather Part 2, But...
","'Scream 2' is one of those films that seems to have suffered most from the backlash against the knowing, self-referential horror films of the late nineties. Not only is it the sequel to the film that started the whole movement ('Wes Craven's New Nightmare' notwithstanding), but it carries the postmodernist game-playing to a new level. Horror purists loathed it for being populist and 'ironic', critics hated slasher movies on principle, and the larger audience were suffering from in-joke fatigue by the time they saw it. So unfortunately, nobody notices that not only is it a better film than the one it succeeds, it's probably the best horror film of the period.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is particularly striking. Everything that made the original's celebrated opening sequence so iconic is either subverted or built upon. So again, a young woman and her boyfriend are stalked and murdered, but this time it plays out in a crowded cinema (showing a tacky reinterpretation of the original, just to reinforce the connection). Where the horror used to be in isolation, it is now found in alienation - the nightmare of dying in front of hundreds of people and nobody lifting a finger to help you is particularly potent. The iconography of ghost-face is played upon here too, not only in the film-within-a-film but the masks members of the audience wear. Given that the film seems to be a refutation of the old 'violent movies cause violence' argument (Sarah Michelle Gellar's character acts as the voice of sanity, Timothy Olyphant's character parodies what Wes Craven clearly considers the voice of insanity), it's striking that in this opening sequence the audience is seen as partly culpable for the murder. The moment when a bleeding Jada Pinkett-Smith cries out on stage, framed by the projection of ghost-face's mask (and bleached out by the white light, an interesting visual cue back to the debate over black characters in horror films that opens the film), and the baying audience subside in uneasy realisation, is one of the most indelible images in a horror film I've ever seen, and a slap in the face for the (real) audience, who have come to the cinema in order to see people get sliced up, after all. It takes a brave movie to implicate its viewers before the film has really got going, and certainly underlines the fact that this is neither a dumb slasher flick or a cheap cash-in on the success of the original.<br/><br/>The potency of the death of this character we have only spent a few minutes in the company of illustrates something else about 'Scream 2' (and 'Scream', for that matter) - that, despite the repeated use of the word by lazy magazine and newspaper critics who ought to know better, they are not 'ironic'. No wonder Kevin Williams turned the definition of the word into a running joke in his later script 'Teaching Mrs Tingle'; he must have been sick of the misallocation of the word in almost every review he read. It implies a style that contrasts the apparent and actual meaning of situations and dialogue. Irony in this sense undercuts what we are being shown and what the characters experience, usually turning it into bathos. There is no irony in the deaths of the characters in 'Scream 2', unlike 'Final Destination 2', for instance, where characters being sliced into pieces by a flying wire fence or crushed by a falling pane of glass are both moments of horror and moments of humour. In contrast, when Hallie buys it so soon after surviving the film's most excruciating suspense sequence, it's horrific because she's a likable, funny character who doesn't deserve to die. The audience responds to the characters on an emotional level, mainly because of Williams's unfairly uncelebrated skill at creating three-dimensional characters in just a handful of scenes (compare with 'Scream 3', scripted by Ehren Kruger, where only Parker Posey's self-obsessed film star stands out), but also because of the skills of an above average cast (particularly Courtney Cox-Arquette, Jamie Kennedy and Liev Schreiber - although frankly Laurie Metcalf calmly pockets the entire movie in a single scene. Compare also Neve Campbell's likable, determined Sidney with Jennifer Love Hewitt's Julie Jameson in the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' films - a drip written (initially by Williams, irritatingly) and acted with half the skill, who constantly needs rescuing by her boyfriend as though she were the heroine of a Victorian melodrama). These are not the corpses-in-waiting of most slasher films, but funny, rounded individuals with their own foibles who die senselessly and horribly. The humour (and it is a very, very funny movie) is not at the expense of the horror, or the characters enduring it. <br/><br/>It's also worth noting the real skill with which Craven orchestrates the suspense, the excellent use of music (particularly some borrowed from the 'Broken Arrow' score), Tori Spelling's gameness (although she gives away the plot twist of 'Stab' in that interview!), and Portia di Rossi's remarkable eyebrows. This movie needs serious re-assessment. Personally, I think it's richer than your average horror-snob's favourite."

What i found so scary about this movie is that you can never guess who is going to be killed next, for example, who thought that out of the main movie, Sarah Michelle Geller would die first? I thought that she would be one of the final ones to die, if not one of the survivors. The ending also really surprised me, i thought that the killer(s) would be the sorority sisters, or Hallie ( i thought it would be girls!) my favourite scene had to be either CiCi's death scene, or the scene where gale is chased (and where Dewey appears to be killed) i think that this movie is definitely one of the best i have seen, and i recommend it even if you haven't seen any of the other scream movies! 10/10"
"djgold_1999","10","5","8","15 September 2008"," It was indeed better then part 1
","Yes, it's true that original movies, like part 1 of any movie or series is claimed to be the ""best"", just because it kicked off everything.<br/><br/>Well if that's so true? Then howcome Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me, was 10 times better then the first part and made more money? I can't speak about this movie, on the the money part. Is it better then part 1, much much better. Non-stop action and killing. Story was good and had twists. The first 1, was more like an 80's slasher flick. It really didn't have much of a moral, it did have you wanting to ask more questions.<br/><br/>This movie did have a huge cast of names, that a big now. Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett Smith, just to name a few. But sorry to dissappoint, but Elise Neal stole some of the movie, from Neve Campbell. She was much prettier and had personality, not ""dim-wittedness"".<br/><br/>If someone would like non-stop action horror with a good story and the least amount of ""yawns"" and slow-downs in a movie, watch this. It's much better then the original. Piece of advice, never ever ever watch Scream 3, absolute garbage, boring and has no story, even if it was paid to have one. Thank You for reading, just accessing my hypothesis."

","Scream 2 is an incredible sequel, a smart, thrilling and self-aware horror sequel that effectively plays with the generic conventions of horror sequels. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox and Jamie Kennedy all give great performances once again. Liev Schreiber also gives a really good performance with his increased screen time. The music by Marco Beltrami is fantastic. Wes Craven's direction is amazing and actually fixes the problem with the last film as there are less fake jump scares, even if some are still unfortunately present. Overall, it's surprisingly better than the original."

","Someone else is killing Sidney's friends at college. Can't this poor girl catch a break?<br/><br/>The stakes were higher, the twists were twistier, the killer(s) were more evil.<br/><br/>It's better than the original, yeah, I said it, and I meant it!"
"MaximumMadness","9","3","4","14 May 2016"," ""Scream 2""- Despite lacking that lightning-in-a-bottle freshness captured flawlessly by the original, this stellar sequel is another win! A fantastic riff on horror sequels!
","It's odd how some films in retrospect were clearly ahead of their time. While the original ""Scream"" is undeniably a classic of both its time and the horror genre as a whole, it's hard not to notice that its stellar first sequel ""Scream 2"" doesn't command nearly the same level of respect with audiences despite garnering similar critical acclaim. And I do think that in a way, it's because ""Scream 2"" was ahead of its time.<br/><br/>How so? It championed and furthered many elements introduced in the original, and fully realizes the potential of some of the elements introduced by its predecessor. Most notable- ""Scream 2"" is one of the most delightfully ""meta"" mainstream films I've seen but it was released about a decade before the whole ""meta"" concept became a ""thing"" that audiences recognized. While today, you can throw a rock and hit something that could be construed (or misconstrued) as ""meta"" not so much back in the 90's. I know a lot of people who saw ""Scream 2"" and its larger focus on meta back in the day as the film just being ""confusing"" or ""sillier"" or ""weird."" Yes, the first film had a lot of meta elements, but it wasn't until this sequel that director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson really went to town and had fun with it. <br/><br/>And I think that it went right over a lot of audience's heads when it came out. But especially looking back now, it's easier to see just why this second go is almost as good as the original, and how this stronger focus on self-aware meta storytelling was a great direction to go. Hell, I think it could be argued it even exceeds the original in some ways.<br/><br/>The film's opening perfectly establishes this hyper-meta tonality when we start at a public screening of ""Stab""- a movie- within-the-movie, based loosely on the events of the original film. It's at this premier that a new ""Ghostface"" emerges, and takes out a couple film-goers in an opening kill that in my opinion matches the shocking iconic start of the original. <br/><br/>Sidney Prescott is now attending college with friend and fellow- survivor Randy, and upon hearing of the new murders, they immediately become suspicious and go on-guard. After being re- united with Dewey and Gale and helping introduce the audience to the newcomer characters, it becomes another fight-for-survival as the new ""Ghostface"" targets our returning heroes, seemingly in an attempt to make a ""real-life sequel"" to the events of the original film.<br/><br/>Like the original, the heart of this follow-up is writer Kevin Williamson's wonderful screenplay. As mentioned above, Williamson dives into full-blown ""meta"" territory here, raising the stakes, the laughs and the scares to new level, but always grounded in a self-aware fashion. He also makes the wise choice of giving the returning characters just enough moments of serious character development without bogging down the fast-pacing or feeling out of place. It's one of the most solid scripts for a horror sequel I think has ever been written. And if one pays attention, you can even see Williamson subtly planting the seeds for future sequels and where it may take the story, though done with a sense of class that doesn't just make it feel like sequel-baiting. (It's just a shame the Williamson-less ""Scream 3"" didn't pay off on these concepts) I do believe that on the whole, the writing for this film is cleverer and wittier than the original.<br/><br/>Craven of course returns, and just as in the original, his classy sense of visual storytelling and direction helps convey the themes, ideas and of course the gags and scares in expert fashion. With the film going as self-aware as it did, I think that in less capable hands, it could have ventured into cartoonish territory. Thankfully, Craven and his confidence in the material keep it from going there, so it's still a blast of fun and has a good sense of tonal continuity with the original.<br/><br/>This film also solidifies that the series cast is just wonderful. Neve Campbell is a revelation in this film and brings more life and pathos to her character. Other returning players such as Jamie Kennedy are a ton of fun. Courtney Cox and David Arquette once again steal the show. And newcomers like Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar fit right in. The best new addition, however, is definitely Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the man Sidney originally suspected of killing her mother before learning this wasn't the case in the original film. Schreiber is a blast as a sort-of sniveling man who is trying to cash-in on his media infamy by forcing Sidney into interviews with him for the news in a hope to gain a bit of fame. It's a very fun part, and Schreiber plays it very well.<br/><br/>However, unlike the original... there are some flaws. And they're what's keeping this just shy of getting a perfect 10. And those flaws almost entirely pertain to the script, as despite the level of cleverness and wit displayed by Williamson's writing, it's got some issues. Most notably that it seems Williamson painted himself into a corner more than once, leading to a few awkward scenes where instead of creatively subverting audience expectations like he did in the original... he relied on the horror cliche's and tropes he spent the entire last film lampooning. (A scene inside of a car involving a knocked-out ""Ghostface"" is a prime example.)<br/><br/>These moments are just too contrary to the other, much better written scenes to ignore, so I have to knock off a point.<br/><br/>However, despite these problems, ""Scream 2"" is another winner. It's furiously entertaining, wickedly creative and simultaneously humorous and horrifying.<br/><br/>A near-perfect 9 out of 10, and a fine example of a sequel-done- right!"
"ekseer","8","3","4","7 October 2014"," A great sequel!
","I loved that the sequel stayed true to the first movie, just added more gore and more blood! The storyline wasn't as good as with the first movie, but then again nothing can top that, but it was still very amusing and fun to watch. It was still suspenseful, and had that horror movie element to it that made the first scream so good. The acting, just got better, Neve, Courteney, and David play their roles exquisitely, and i can't imagine other actors in the roles of Sidney, Gale, and Dewey. All in all, if you liked the first one, and love horror/slasher movies, you wont regret watching this installment in the series!"
"ARTaylor","10","3","4","16 October 2012"," Exception to the Sequel Rule
","In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them.<br/><br/>Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better.<br/><br/>With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way.<br/><br/>Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILER<br/><br/>The cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as ""evil"" as Billy did.<br/><br/>Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience."
"freemantle_uk","8","3","4","18 December 2011"," A strong, knowing sequel
","Wes Craven is of course a legend to horror fans for his work on films like Nightmare on Elm Street and The Hills Have Eyes. He was the perfect man to make Scream, a post modern homage and comedy of slasher films but also a good slasher on its own. Writer Kevin Williamson originally wanted to make Scream a trilogy, so getting Wes Craven was a sensible decision to keep the series going.<br/><br/>A year after the events of Scream a film has been about it, ""Stab"". During a preview screening two university students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) are murdered in a crowded cinema. The media descend on the university which the hero from the first film, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is studying at. And it all seem like it was going well for Sidney who seem to get her life back on track. But the survivors of the first film become the targets of the new ghost face killer as the body court starts to raise.<br/><br/>Like the first film there is sharp dialogue throughout, there is insight about horror genre and theories about whether violence in film influence violence in real life (I personally think that rubbish because if you got violence tendencies you don't need a film to influence you) and it both a commentary on the genre and social attitudes. Even if Scream and Scream 2 were made as straight forward slasher films they would seen be better then most because the character are more likable and believable then in most slashers, making you care for characters if something happens to them. I also really like Craven's way of shooting chases with the way the camera follows the action of someone being chased in a easy to follow yet tense way. Paul Greengrass should take note that a scene can be tense without the need of shaky cam preventing the audience working out what's happening.<br/><br/>The acting is decent enough. Courtney Cox's character Gail Weathers grows to be a little more softer and likable with more tender scenes. Campbell is very solid as the lead, forced back into a situation she thought she would never face again. But after going through all this twice I would have thought she would be psychological scarred for life. Elise Neal and Pinkett basically play typical sassy black women, especially Pinkett who is also a woman with an axe to grind about women's and African American's rights. Jerry O'Connell who plays Sidney's boyfriend is made out to be a decent bloke if a bit of a preppy. I personally thought that Liev Schreiber was a bit of a weak link because I really did not buy into performance and his looked like he was on autopilot.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is also filled with subplots, one of them being the three other survivors believing one of them is the killer and they go on the search to find out who it really is and one able Cotton (Schreiber) wanting to get Sidney to agree to an interview about how her evidence got him arrested for her mother's murder and so he could put his side of the story out to the media. There were well handled and did not distract from main plot which a fast paced affair. The scene on the university court yard was an additional tense when characters try and find Ghostface.<br/><br/>The film starts off being very similar to the first film, a 10 minute prologue, the police and media going crazy, the debate of film and Sidney punching Gail, it is still different from the first and not just a repeat of Scream. For the most part Scream 2 still plays on horror clichés like two characters arguing a case about whether to run or check to see if the killer is dead and have a valid argument. But sometimes Scream 2 does fall into the cliché trap like a cop having a chance to kill Ghostface or the characters splitting up when Ghostface is around. But it still a strong, entertaining knowing horror film."

Now Sidney (Neve Campbell), Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Dewey (David Arquette), Gale and Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) find themselves in danger.

Some film critics (For example the late Gene Siskel) felt the sequel was much better. There's an amusing film within the film, which those scenes are directed (uncredited) by Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids Trilogy, Grindhouse, The Faculty).<br/><br/>The Original DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Stab is the movie telling about what happened on the previous Scream. It was also based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' and was written by the tabloid twit Gale Weathers. After that Sid ney aware that it's happening again. On this movie, also there's the movie geek Randy Meeks, the lovable and huggable Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and cute Sidney Prescott.<br/><br/>Also, in the scene where Cici is stalked by the killer and was killed is very similar to the previous Scream scene where Casey Becker and her boyfriend were stalked and murdered. Finally, the killers were finally revealed to be Mickey Altieri and Debbie Salt, whom is the mother to the previous killer Billy Loomis. The car scene is quite intense and scary indeed. I really don't like the scene where Sidney playing as Cassandra on a play and saw the killer. <br/><br/>So that's all, and i really appreciate Scream so much because it was very entertaining. The Scream 2 can really need a little bit of improvement."

But Sidney is off to college now, and things are beginning to look up. She has a good best friend, Hallie (Elise Neal), and a love interest, Derek (Jerry O'Connell). But after a murder that occurred in a cinema (that was incidentally showing a movie based upon the murder spree that Sidney survived), the memories flood back, and another masked killer in the same attire begins to murder those around Sidney - but who is it behind the mask? <br/><br/>A follow-up to Wes Craven's 1996 horror hit, ""Scream"", this slasher sequel is a guaranteed good time. Kevin Williamson returns to write the script for this film as well, and crafts a fairly solid story to continue the series with. The opening of this movie (the cleverly-executed cinema murder) was fabulous, and is probably the most memorable thing about this movie. There is some tongue-in-cheek humor to be found as well, but nothing over the top - this film remains fairly serious despite it's poking at the horror genre rules, which is something the original did quite well. I have to give Mr. Craven and Mr. Williamson some credit for their clever handling of these films, because they really are well-done horror movies.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy return from the original, all giving good performances. Some new additions to the cast are Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Sarah Michelle Gellar (who starred in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" the same year), to name a few. The acting is on-par for the most part, and I liked the casting. The atmosphere in this film is much different than the small-town feel the original had, which I personally preferred - then again, you can't have a movie like this take place in the same town for a second time. There are plenty of surprise moments as well (and some clichéd jump-scares), but the conclusion was probably the biggest surprise of all. I never saw it coming, and I don't think most people would because the writing was so well done. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Scream 2"" is a worthy sequel to a groundbreaking horror movie. Did I like it better than the first? No way, I prefer the original, but that doesn't mean it was bad at all. It was entertaining, spooky, and had enough twists and turns to keep nearly anyone's interest. ""Scream"" fans will be surely pleased with it.

","Forget all intelligence, all ye who view this...<br/><br/>As was to be expected, this is a sub-par horror film; a commercial and idiotic venture to cash in on the recent and inexplicable slasher-film revival, which the equally dumb first part helped start. It's a self-indulgent piece of crap, with its lame film-buff in-jokes and sad attempts to be original and funny by satirizing sequels, films in general, and even itself. Craven and his gang of ""creators"" are so concerned with misleading and confusing the viewer as to who the killer may be, that they totally ignore the need for logic, or at least a decent amount of credibility (""decent"" being very little, since this is the slasher genre - the worst horror sub-genre; its ugliest offspring, so-to-speak). I quickly saw through Craven's ""trick"" to give all (key) characters motives for being killers, early on (an old, old Agatha Christie tool), and then have them suspect each other. So I tried thinking logically (a mistake, naturally) as to who this boring killer may be; I decided half-way through the film that it must be the black cameraman. Why? Because. No, sorry: that would be a WES CRAVEN EXPLANATION. I can do better than that... Here's why the black guy should be the killer:<br/><br/>1) He would be the first black killer in a slasher film (or?), and this would have been terribly original in Craven's book.<br/><br/>2) He was the film's comic-relief (and a very unfunny one, by the way).<br/><br/>3) It actually fits in neatly with a couple of scenes in the film.<br/><br/>& most importantly:<br/><br/>4) He has no motive whatsoever.<br/><br/>Alas, Craven decides that one of the two killers, the student, has a motive which is ten times more ridiculous than any I have ever witnessed in any film before, and ten times less of a motive than any other character in the film had: his motive is his hunger for O.J.-like court-room notoriety and media drama and fame. What does this teach us, that we never knew before? It teaches us that sometimes no motive at all is better than a Wes Craven motive. <br/><br/>The absurdity of the other killer, the mother(!) of the murdered killer in the first part, is equally impressive: this woman poses as a TV reporter (why??) (idea stolen from ""Se7en"") in the entire film without anyone recognizing her. No one from their small town - and there's half-a-dozen of those idiots hanging around the college and thereabouts - recognized her, apart from Campbell in the final scenes.<br/><br/>Then there is the film's finale... If I had any willingness left in me to forgive Craven for some of the many moronisms, it was all but destroyed by this laughable, manic, over-the-top, gab-and-shoot-fest finale which has to be seen to be believed! Horror films and thrillers are infamous and even feared for their awfully dumb endings, but this one surpasses even the most hardened skeptic's expectations. Yes, that's right: it's possibly as dumb as ""Hitcher""'s ending. <br/><br/>Then we have David Arquette's atrocious acting... When will nepotism finally become punishable by electrocution in Hollywood?! This guy, apart from looking like a total loser, is the KING OF ALL OVER-ACTORS and hasn't got a clue what it means to act out a scene and not grimace his way through a scene as though to show the director your latest Beverly Hills facial aerobics exercises. (Craven must have gotten a threesome with the Arquette sisters in return for putting their brother in a major film.)<br/><br/>But we have to give Craven some credit, though: the service he provided the black culture in America by finally slaughtering blacks in a slasher film, is immeasurable. Hip hop hooray. Craven is an ACLU hero!<br/><br/>But the heaviest criticism is not that he is a commercial director, or that he works with lousy scripts, or that the plot is laughable, or that he is self-indulgent... No. It's that he is predictable. This film is in fact just that. There were at least half-a-dozen scenes which were predictable from the moment they began; it was always obvious who'd get killed and who'd escape, and sometimes even how. A sequel will be coming to cinemas near you, as soon as Craven and his gang of idiots think of a way of having even more absurd killers and even dumber motives.<br/><br/>Here are a few suggestions for ""Scream 3"" (& 4,5,6...):<br/><br/>1) The Killer: The great-grandfather of the murdered mother (in ""Scream 2"") of her murdered son (""Scream""), who lived on Mars and decided to go back to Earth after following the events in the previous two films.<br/><br/>His Motives: revenge, plus the fact that Martians threatened to kill him if he didn't amuse them by doing something violent on Earth. <br/><br/>2) The Killer: The great-great-great-grandfather of the killer in ""Scream 3"", who lived on Jupiter, and decided to go back to Earth after following the events in the previous three films.<br/><br/>His Motives: revenge, plus the fact that Jupiterians made him do it to prove that an Earthling can amuse them as well as he can amuse the Martians (who are their rivals for rule over that asteroid belt).<br/><br/>3) The Killers: all the innocent people in the previous four parts. They kill only Neve Campbell, proving once again that Craven can still think of original plots: having a dozen people kill one person, instead of the other way around. Isn't it brilliant!?<br/><br/>Their Motives: jealousy and anger over the fact that while all of them got injured and some even crippled through the series, she got away from all the violence with only minor bruises.<br/><br/>The Reason: Neve wants to finally get out of the series. <br/><br/>If you want a satiric biography of David Arquette (and other Hollywood morons) contact me by e-mail."

"stamper","7","4","7","18 June 2000"," A Classic's sequel
","Well this in a way is a typical sequel and in a way it is not. You have all the original cast here which is I must say a must in a sequel. You really shouldn't do that kind of stuff they did in for instance Chucky or so, keep the cast if the names are the same, all else is bull and most of the audience won't like it. Also don't change a good formula!!!! (this goes out to them suckers who want to make Scream 4 without the original cast (or even dare to think about it)). If you want to do it do it with them or NOT and if you do, please Neve, Courteney, David and Wes only when the script is great, no ONLY when it RULES and do not do it for money when your career is in a dip like van Damme did with Universal Sodier 2. I mean look at lousy horror sequels: Hellraiser 2 and 4, Chucky 3, Nightmare on Elm Street 5 and A new Nightmare (sorry Wes).<br/><br/>This is I must admit not the second time I watched this one, for I was preparing to see Scream 3 really soon afterwards, so I wanted to see Scream 1 and Scream 2 before, so I could get back in to everything that happened. I already knew, of course, who the killer was and this review (as to the whodunnit) looks at the film as if I first saw it.<br/><br/>Another good thing here is that all the cast looks grown up, I mean between Scream and Scream 2 there is only one year, but you feel as if many years have gone by (just as the story suggests). This is especially extreme with Neve Campbell, who in Scream looked like 15 or 16 and here looks like 19 or so. I must also say, that the new looks of Campbell and Courteney Cox are much better (they look good, with those clothes and different hair, yummy!!!!). There are yet some other pretty ladies running about, what about that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sid's on screen friend played by Elise Neil. Of course you can see also Portia DeRossi also, who is if I may say is pretty too (normally), but here is just a non - ugly (along with all her sorority sisters) female. I must say though she plays one genuine bleached blonde bim.. (you fill out the rest) here. Also there was of course the shagadelic Heather Graham, who played in the movie Stab' but who had a real bad wig there in the movie within the movie. But she was not as pretty either here.<br/><br/>This one may be not as original as the first one, but it still is funny, exciting, surprising (you never know who is/are the killer(s)) and well acted. For the psycho killer(s) I must say he/she/they was/were great, you really believed he/she /they were totally flipped and you bought it. Neve Campbell really has grown in acting and is yet much more believable and so are David Arquette and Courteney Cox, whose characters are deepened out.<br/><br/>NOW I want to spend a few lines on the great Neve Campbell, I thought she will be great (as in a successful actress) when I saw The Craft, Scream, Scream 2, but I must revise this now, she chooses to stay and make low budget films, that are not so heavily supported by the studios and so tend to make little money. But I must say that it is a good choice as long as the movies are as good as Wild Things or Simba's Pride.<br/><br/>The best thing here though is the direction, Wes Craven made this one much more theatrical than the first one, and there are two scenes I LUV especially, the opening scene and the rehearsal scene. They are great and combine effects, music and events perfectly. Also there are some great spoofs. Now I bet you wonder why this does not get a 10, I presume, well I felt that some things should not have been done in the film, like that scene when Cox and Arquette go see some footage. Also I didn't like the new camera dude that much, played by Duane Martin, for I thought his frightened' character was too overdone. Also I found the ending not very good, it was mere average. The end of Scream was much and much better, so it come that this film does not get a 10.<br/><br/>Still: rent, watch and enjoy<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"preppy-3","10","3","5","25 October 2015"," Incredible sequel
","This is a rarity--a sequel that doesn't suck! This takes place a few years after ""Scream"". Sidney (Neve Campbell) is in college still recovering from virtually all her friends being killed years before. Then a movie called ""Stab"" opens that is a fictional account of what happened. Then the murders start happening again centered around Sidney. GREAT sequel with a wonderful script, mostly great acting and plenty of action. The body count has been upped, the killings are more brutal and bloody and this film is very scary. There is humor of course but it takes a back seat to horror. Well-directed by Wes Craven too. <br/><br/>There's only two problems. One is David Arquette. He's TERRIBLE in his role. He appears drugged out. The second is the killer seems to magically teleport himself to where his victims are. This happens at least three times in the course of the film! Still, if you're a horror film like me, you learn how to totally suspend your disbelief and go with it. A fast, funny and bloody sequel. Avoid ""Scream 3"" at all costs."
"DunnDeeDaGreat","9","3","5","19 November 2001"," Very good sequel
","Scream 2 did what most horror films can't which is live up to the original. Neve Campbell is good as always and even my boy Randy becomes the pimp s*** in this movie. I love all the pop cutlure references and film references. Because of that the film gets **** out of ****."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","2","3","9 May 2019"," Scream 2 yells for bigger, better and more elaborate kills but rarely receives them.
","Much discussion is made in the film regarding sequels, outlining a standard set of patterns that are common in horror classics. ""Body count is always bigger"". ""Death scenes are much more elaborate"". ""Never, under any circumstances, assume the killer is dead"". For all the irony and meta dialogue that Williamson slaps onto his screenplay, Craven just doesn't deliver fully. Whether that be a loosely designed curveball to keep viewers on edge, or sheer lack of ingenuity, well that's up for debate. Alas, as good as this sequel is, it never truly exhumed the natural intelligence of its predecessor. Two years after the Woodsboro killings, a copycat killer using the same guise as ""Ghostface"" terrorises Sidney's new college.<br/><br/>Satirising several clichés found in film sequels is a pivotal element to Williamson's screenplay. Massive discussions over infamous sequels bettering the original, outlining the tendencies found within them and comedically teasing 'Empire Strikes Back' as a planned sequel therefore being discarded from the argument. Relatable to an absurd degree. The type of conversations I have every single day. So, once again, the dialogue was punchy, extremely meta and gives the characters plenty of personality. The cast was something else too. A young Sarah Michelle Gellar and Timothy Olyphant in the same film? It's poetic! Amusingly, I screamed twice in excitement. Playful performances with an adequate amount of returning characters, raising the suspicion level to glorious heights. Craven keeps the tone light throughout, despite being a glorified slasher, retaining the refreshing aura that made the original unique. Naturally, it's not groundbreaking the second time round, but a watchable sequel nonetheless.<br/><br/>There are, however, issues. Beltrami's score was obnoxiously overbearing, with a late inclusion of both Elfman and Zimmer. Various character themes drowned out the dialogue, particularly Dewey's, and relinquished any genuine investment towards them. The narrative shifts between Sidney Prescott and Gale ""You Just Got Weathered"" Weathers made it difficult to distinguish who the main character was and inadvertently eliminated most of the suspects from the list. Quicker than usual. The constant shifts between them, whilst balanced, threw the pacing off considerably with the second act containing zero kills. The death sequences themselves, minus the introductory scene which was excellent, were hardly memorable despite Craven trying to set up more extravagant kills. The third act and final reveal were incredibly messy (probably to do with the famous leak that happened), with seemingly most of the budget going towards that Cassandra play. Oh, and the death of a certain character did not sit well with me (and fans clearly...).<br/><br/>Still, even with my reservations, it's a decent sequel that could've been flattened by a lack of imagination. But Craven pulls through, only just. Scream 3 will definitely need to scream harder..."

But despite the fun it has with sequels and references to all sorts of other things it still comes back to being a slasher film and that really is a limitation. The original had the advantage of bringing back and all but dead (sorry!) genre and parodied many of the situations and archetypes that typified those films, the sequel does not have that advantage."
"Leofwine_draca","4","2","3","11 December 2016"," Follows the first film's formula too closely to be effective
","Wes Craven was quick to jump on the bandwagon he had created with his surprise hit SCREAM, delivering us a sequel barely months after the first. As expected, it's not as good as the original film, and in fact doesn't come close. This time around the emphasis is on comedy rather than horror. SCREAM 2 is witty, clever, and self-indulgent (as to be expected) and it's a bit of fun watching the original cast members go through their paces once again. But this is just not enough.<br/><br/>Courtney Cox and Neve Campbell both seem to be competing for thinnest female performer and they look a lot like zombies here. David Arquette offers up some suspect comic value with his limp (he was stabbed in the back in the first film) but the star of the show is Jamie Kennedy, who returns as geek Randy from the first film. Kennedy is the brightest star of them all and the best scene comes where he is being terrorised by the murderer in the park. Also appearing are Sarah Michelle Gellar in a typical pretty-faced role, and Jerry O'Connell who is good value as Campbell's boyfriend.<br/><br/>The gore this time consists of stabbing and shooting, there's a lot of blood but no real imagination to the killings (apart from the first death where a man is stabbed in the side of the head through a toilet cubicle wall). Also, again as expected, there are a lot of protracted stalk and slash sequences towards the end of the film, before the clichéd and disappointing finale which could have been a lot better - and more original - than it was. It's a fun film to watch but it's a sequel that covers no new ground and is merely a continuation of the first film. We could have done without it, because honestly speaking this came too fast after the first one and followed the same formula too closely to be as effective. And as for SCREAM 3..."

Again directed by Wes Craven it should be another hit.<br/><br/>Not that it was that bad but some scene's took too long (espescially towards the end) and the plot like in the original one wasn't anywhere to spot. But it is still worth picking up but not that gory as the original one. What was nice is that all characters were back with their original thespians and that did add something towards the belief in the story. <br/><br/>Another success it became and the franchise was started.

","Like Aliens and T2, Scream 2 is one of the only sequels as great as the original. Picking up after the events of the original Sidney is off at college with Randy and some new friends when the murders start up again. Like the original the film is a slasher whodunit as we along the characters try and figure out who it is as it marches towards its thrilling conclusion. Like any great sequel of which there is few it expands the universe and fleshes out the characters even more. There is one emotionally devastating scene concerning Dewey and Gale that may be the best of the series. Craven refreshingly adapts the material bringing new life to the genre. The movie is comedic but also suspenseful, scary and surprising. When the mystery finally unfolds it's not only shocking but so well constructed you can't help but be awed by the complex methodology that went it to it courtesy of its amazing creators master Wes Craven and my idol Kevin Williamson and the strong cast that pull it off. Speaking of performances everything is upped a notch. Neve Campbell is electrifying as Sidney giving her a u pique strength and relatable vulnerability. Courtney Cox really has a journey in this film as Gale and David Arquette is again wonderfully and layered as Dewey. As for the newbies Timothy Olyphant, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf and Liev Schreiber offer solid support. This entry has a bit more to say about the mechanics of the genre and is even a bit more involved than it's predecessor but the sheer magnetism of the first is never fully met.

"Min111","Null","1","1","30 November 2018"," It's scary than Scream
","I enjoyed Scream 2 right the way throughout just like Scream. Scream 2 has ties to Scream, so it's important to see the first one before the second one, otherwise it will be pointless. These movies have to be watched in order. I enjoyed watching Scream, but I enjoyed watching Scream 2 more. Why is that? It's because Scream 2 was much scarier. It was unpredictable. I think Scream 2 was almost as good, if not just as good as Scream, but both were kind of different when it came to style and tone. Scream was dark; Scream 2 was more darker. It was hard to separate the two. I don't think Scream and Scream 2 should be compared. It would be unfair. You can tell just how different Scream 2 is from Scream. You need to see it for yourselves in order to find out. Scream 2 was much scarier than Scream, and the kills were even more amazing, so amazing that it literally was scary. It got me scared. Scream was a great movie, but Scream 2 takes things much further. I can't believe how scary Scream 2 actually was. Scream was scary, but Scream 2 was even more scary. I don't know how that was possible, but somehow, it was. Unlike the first one, this one had so much suspense, and that's what I like about Scream 2. It keeps you at the edge of your seat. It's important to turn the volume-up in order to feel the suspense if you're watching this for the very first time. You won't regret it. It's one the scariest movies you'll ever see. It's one of the 'best horror sequels' I have ever seen. The plot or story was very good, and I really liked who Ghostface was in this one, and I don't know how else it could've been portrayed any better. The only downside is that it's fairly obvious who Ghostface was. I don't know about you, but it was kind of predictable for me. But I did like who the killer or killers were in Scream 2. Scream 2 was a good sequel. One of the best horror sequels there is."
"david_rudy_lee","9","1","1","16 November 2018"," Great follow up to a modern classic
","I first watched this film when it came on VHS. I really enjoyed the original and was excited that they made a sequel. It didn't hurt the original was one of my favorite films at the time. I really liked that they also brought back a lot of characters as well. To get into this, the official synopsis is two years after the first series of murders, as Sydney (Neve Campbell) acclimates to college life; someone donning the Ghostface costume begins a new string of killings.<br/><br/>This sequel is quite interesting in that it really takes the meta feel to the next level. The events for the first film have been made into a movie. A sneak peek is being shown at a theater by a college. A couple, Maureen (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Phil (Omar Epps) are going, even though she doesn't like horror films. Phil loves them. I like that Maureen gives her reasons to hate them are valid, African-Americans don't normal survive long and woman aren't portrayed the best either. They both are murdered, which is an interesting look at the horror audience that the theater goers think it is a publicity stunt. They are cheering for the deaths on screen and for the death that is happening before them. It takes them time to realize it is real. Going back to the meta, it is ironic that her fears become true as well.<br/><br/>Prank calls are up again for Sydney as well with the film coming out. Her roommate is concerned, Hallie (Elise Neal), that they need to change their number again. When she hears about the murders she seeks out her friend, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), who is in film class. There are some famous people with him in the class, Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and Joshua Jackson. They are having a debate about the murders and sequels to films.<br/><br/>The killer starts to stalk Sydney and there are patterns to the murders that involve the events from the original film. Sydney starts to wonder who it could be. She starts to wonder if it is her new boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell), or the man she thought killed her mother, Cotton Weary (Live Schreiber). Things don't get easier when Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) and other reporters hounding her. Dewey Riley (David Arquette) is also there to try to help her.<br/><br/>This film is interesting in continuing the meta aspect and expanding it to how sequels to films change the rules that the previous film did. As a horror film fan, these are pretty spot on. They normally are bloodier, higher body counts and expand on the story that was set forth in the previous film. We get all of this for the film. There is a reveal that I won't spoil here for those that might not have seen it. I did find this to be a little bit unbelievable though. It was good that Sydney points this out, but I do believe they were on the screen together at one point, so I don't get how it doesn't happen earlier.<br/><br/>On the other side though, I love what the reason that the killer was going to use as their excuse. It plays off what the previous film was trying to refute, but it was something that we saw in the news. I think they might have a chance to get away with what they are doing. Personally I disagree with the argument, but the killer doesn't even believe it outside of an excuse. It also is interesting that they want to go to trial for their 20 minutes of fame. This is even more relevant today as I think that is partially the reason for a lot of mass killings we see.<br/><br/>The film is paced very well, much like the previous one. The running time is again close to two hours, but it doesn't feel like it. The mystery is also good for this one, even though I didn't care for one of the reveals. For deepening the story of the franchise, I do like it as it adds another dimension. It isn't all that believable that no one would notice who the person was. The other one though was really good. I do like how the film ends as it fitting.<br/><br/>Acting for this film I thought was pretty solid, much like the previous film. Campbell I think is great in her role. This adds another dimension to her as she was a survivor from the last film. She doesn't know what to do or who to trust, but she is much stronger in this film. I like what she does for the ending as well, even though her head is messed with for part of it. Neal is fine as the friend. Schreiber is good in his minor role that he has. Kennedy is great again as he is me in my friend's group and I love his knowledge of the genre. It is good to have Cox and Arquette back; their characters have some growth that is good. I also want to shout-out the cameos by Gellar, Olyphant and Jackson.<br/><br/>Much like the previous film, the effects look good in this one. They went practical again and it looks real. The knife wounds look like the person was really cut. There are also some gunshots that happen, that aren't covered up too much and actually look like it could have happened. I have to give the film credit for that.<br/><br/>This film does lack a little bit from the previous in the score. I do like some of the selections; they bring back one of the songs from the first film that I thought fit very well in this one. I do think that this soundtrack fits the scenes and definitely never hurts it. It just isn't as good.<br/><br/>Now with that said, even though this one takes a step back, I think this film is still really good. I'm not the biggest fan of one of the reveals to this film, but I like how it adds to the story. I do think this is a sequel adds on what the previous film did. The pacing as well as the effects of this film is great. The acting is good. Score of the film isn't as good, but I still don't have any issues with it. Overall I'd also say this is a really good film and if you like the first one, definitely give this a viewing. Its meta nature makes it definitely self aware and good for people who are non-fans of the genre."
"Sleepin_Dragon","8","1","1","26 January 2018"," Plenty of Screams here.
","People often talk about how poor sequels are in comparison to the originals, but with Scream that is far from the case, the original in my eyes is a classic, it helped redefine the Slasher movie, return it to the fore front of cinema for several years. Scream 2 in some ways is better then the first, the script is a little tighter, it's not afraid to have a cheeky laugh at its own expense, the killings are perhaps bigger and bolder, and they find a way to shut Sarah Michelle Gellar up, who could ask for more.<br/><br/>Some of the cinematography is excellent, it's a very good looking film. I think Neve Campbell's stage dance is one of the film's best moments, it works on so many levels, menace and confusion, it is very nicely done, similar to those great moments in the opening sequences at the cinema too, we as an audience are allowed to see what's going on in the midst of the noise and distraction.<br/><br/>It loses points for making Dewey a complete and utter idiot, every time I watch this now I can only see his character from Scary movie, but there's little difference between the two. The killer(s) certainly comes as a surprise.<br/><br/>A very good Slasher movie."

","Scream 2 is set two years after the events in Scream. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has moved on and has tried to put things behind her. But her new life and her old life soon cross paths as a new killer shows his face (well, not really - he's wearing a mask). Sidney's friends are being picked-off one-by-one and she in a fight for life. <br/><br/>For me, Scream 2 isn't as good as Scream, but for a film that was rushed into production and had the difficult task of following a modern horror phenomenon, it's really a decent film. I'll give a lot of the credit to the director, Wes Craven, and a talented group of actors. Craven was a real pro. The fact that he was able to take this bloated script and turn it into something watchable is almost a miracle. He does an excellent job creating tension and atmosphere with several of the kills. I'm probably most impressed with Randy's death scene given that it takes place in broad daylight in a crowded common area. Nicely done. As for the acting, it's a strong cast for a film like this. Campbell is joined by actors like Liev Schreiber, Timothy Olyphant, Jamie Kennedy, Courteney Cox, Jerry O'Connell, and Laurie Metcalf - all more than capable. Very nice. You know, if it weren't for an overload of self-referential nonsense, a 2+ hour runtime in desperate need of editing, and the ridiculous opening movie theater sequence, I could easily see rating Scream 2 much higher. Still, it's entertaining enough to warrant a 6/10."

","It still made me jumpy and scream but it's not as great as the former movie. It's about knowing the formula and somehow I could predict what the killer's gonna do. The scene where Sidney and her friend got trapped in a police car while the killer passed out in the front seat yet they both managed to get away is kinda extravagance. Well, maybe it was the killer's trick, though. But how do I know? <br/><br/>The ending where Sidney and the killer were dueling was my favorite part. What Sidney did was so awesome. This girl really can act fast and unerring even when in a tough situation. Too bad, the scene where Gale rose up after being shot gave me a weird face. What made it worst is when the killer also did the same exact thing. Too cliché. Thank God he did nothing but made an odd movement."

","Scream 2. As much as you may love the original Scream, you may not enjoy Scream 2 nearly as much. Most fans consider the first superior; it has a 6.1 compared to Scream's 7.2 on IMDb, a 61% on Metacritic to Scream's 63%, and it rarely beats the original in both forums and rankings of the films. (To be fair, it does have 2% higher on Rotten Tomatoes, at 81%, to Scream's 79%.) After all it is a sequel, which deems it a dumping ground for many fans of the genre, including Randy.<br/><br/>Randy's argument in Scream 2 is simple: sequels are often paint-by-the- numbers Hollywood cash grabs (looking at you, Friday the 13th Part 2), following the original verbatim, with no original screams or laughs. Scream 2 initially does follow the structure of the original. The victims of the second movie match those in the first movie to a limited extent, leading Gale to invent the copycat theory, which states that the killer is patterning himself after the original film.<br/><br/>Williamson is, in the meta style beloved by fans of the franchise, stating that Scream 2 is, prior to his death, inferior to the original. After this point in the film the copycat theory falls apart, as Randy was obviously not killed in the original. Starting at this point, the film becomes far more exciting: all bets are off, as the death of the franchise's most beloved supporting character kicks off a whirlwind building to an epic chase in a theater which comprises roughly the second half of the film.<br/><br/>One of the more often discussed points of Scream 2 is that Mickey's love for sequels foreshadows that he is the killer. Sidney believed Billy and Stu killed because they ""had seen one too many horror movies""; she may also have believed that Mickey simply took his love of sequels too far, leading him to join the serial killer network described by Mrs. Loomis near the end of the film and promptly join her on the murderous rampage which claimed the lives of eight innocent students. In effect, Mickey symbolizes support for the sequel in the horror genre, and when he kills Randy, who represents disdain for sequels (going so far as to claim they ruined the horror genre), Williamson sends a much-needed ""fuck you"" to those who, although fans of the first film, disregard the second.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as sequels are often deemed unoriginal, enjoying them may imply that sequel lovers are themselves less original. In Scream 2, this is certainly true, as Mickey's motivations are hardly unique, both in that he agrees with the moral majority which believes horror movies create psychos and in that he fills in for Stu's role in the first film, in acting as the sidekick who is first to go. Williamson would be hard-pressed to cite an example of Mickey expanding meaningfully on the Scream mythos as he functions as a killer. In effect, Mickey himself also represents the convention of the horror sequel: a paint-by-the-numbers cash grab (as I described earlier). Thus, Mickey's death essentially represents the death of the unoriginal sequel; much as Scream hoped to end horror clichés such as ""I'll be right back"" and investigating a strange noise, Scream 2 hopes to end unoriginal sequels.<br/><br/>I have heard criticisms that Mickey's character is too on-the-nose, in that he is a film director ranting about the psychological effects of horror films. However, this critique falls apart quickly when we compare it against the incredible reveal in Scream 1, in which Billy states the famous line, ""movies don't make psychos, Sid. Movies make psychos more creative"". The Scream franchise has never been particularly subtle, ranging from the thinly veiled allusions to Columbine in Scream 3, the aforementioned scenes in both the original and the sequel, and the rant about the increasingly contrived additions to the Stab franchise (time travel is a major plot point of Stab 5) which implies the pointlessness of any Scream film past Scream 3. And I have never heard any of those films criticized for their bluntness.<br/><br/>Scream 2 understands the genre deeper than even the original film. Its first major point of analysis is its middle finger to detractors, its second the (naive) death of unoriginal genre sequels. However, there is another key insight.<br/><br/>It occurs when Mrs. Loomis shoots Mickey. In order to understand why this death matters, we have to understand what Mrs. Loomis represents. Out of all seven killers within the movie franchise, nine counting the MTV television series, Mrs. Loomis is the only one not affiliated with the genre in some way or form. Billy and Stu are casual fans who took pointers from the genre. Billy mentions The Exorcist, and Stu mentions watching a few horror movies, likely slashers such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street- and taking notes. Mickey is a film student, obsessed with proving that sequels can be better than the original. Roman is a film director who abandons his in-movie movie Stab 3 for the real movie Scream 3 and set in motion the events of the first film, after creating a ""family film"" documenting the affair between Maureen Prescott and Hank Loomis, Billy's father. Jill enjoys watching Shaun of the Dead with Kirby. Charlie flirts with Kirby about minute details of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, films everything, and asks his classmates randomly what their favorite scary movie is, awkwardly Ghostface without Piper is familiar with horror tropes, as we learn in her reveal in which she rants about the sexist assumption that the killer had to be the son of Brandon James, and finally, Kieran does not seem to be aware of the genre, but he is a bit of an exception already, having been the only Ghostface to be killed by another Ghostface and be part of 2 separate killing sprees."

"ddean-52016","7","1","1","31 May 2015"," My personal review on Scream 2
","As Far as sequels go Scream 2 does a very good job at upping the Steaks and pays homage to its original. Scream 2 follows the Character Of Sydney once again as she has just gotten use to a normal life and settles in to society until Ghost face appears in a cinema showing Stab where hundreds of fans appear in ghost face masks which makes it a lot easier for the real ghost face to kill who ever he wants. After the murders in the cinema Sydney slowly realizes her life is in danger again and we are introduced to some familiar characters and a few new ones. Throughout the movie we are shown many kills and in my opinion they are not quite as good as they could have been as a third of the kills were off screen and all we could do is hear them, but that's not always a bad thing as one of the kills taken place in a van is very impactive even more so as it is a well loved character being killed. Over all the film has many jump scares, doesn't take itself to seriously and does an amazing job of giving the audience tension in my personal opinion anyway and also in my opinion Scream 2 manages to surpass even its original and many ways which is what I love in any sequel but don't get to often"
"suite92","7","1","1","11 November 2013"," Gale from Scream writes a book that becomes a movie; the well of revenge is not empty yet.
","Since the happenings of the previous film, Gale wrote a book, The Woodsboro Murders, which becomes a movie called Stab.<br/><br/>We follow a black couple into a showing of the film, which reminds me of showings of Rocky Horror Picture Show that I've experienced. The audience is largely costumed, the theatre operates some props, and the audience brings some 'required' stuff. The couple get knifed to death, separately, which establishes the context of the rest of the picture.<br/><br/>So, we're in the self-referential environment of Scream, but with the passage of time, and an evolution in the setting.<br/><br/>The film class discussion of original movies versus sequels went on too long. Like Scream, this is just over the top self-regarding nonsense, with too much discussion of particular movies within another movie.<br/><br/>Gale arranges a meeting between Cotton and Sidney, without telling Sidney. Even Cotton thought that was a bit much. Sidney hits Gale again, during filming. Dewey is displeased with Gale for her characterization of him in her book as Barney Fife. Ish.<br/><br/>Sidney might pledge at Delta Lambda Zeta, so we have another mini-universe of clichés to exploit. Cici is at the Omega Beta Zeta house, and becomes the next victim in the cycle. Back at the mixer, Portia di Rossi's eyebrows were hideous. The attention quickly shifts from the mixer to Cici's death and the swarming of cops and reporters.<br/><br/>The costumed assailant attacks Sidney in the DLZ house after the crowd has left. Derek gets stabbed, but far from fatally. The next morning, there is a lot of assessment and not enough facts. Dewey, the Sheriff, and Gale notice a pattern in the names of the new victims versus the principals in the earlier case.<br/><br/>Sidney gets invited by Gus Gold to play Cassandra. The costumes in the play are more than a bit reminiscent of the murderer's Halloween get up. Also, they have knives, so this was not such a great idea.<br/><br/>Randy gets killed in Gale's van while it's on the quad; Sidney gets a death threat in the library. Goodness. Cotton has a talk with Sidney in the school library; she wants to leave, he won't have it; he starts yelling like everything while still in the library. The cops take him in for an alternate discussion.<br/><br/>Dewey and Gale pore over footage from recent crime scenes, looking for the culprit. That worked out fairly well for the killer. Dewey has a more than rough spot; the killer rushes off to go after Sidney and Hallie.<br/><br/>The picture wraps up hard and fast after that.<br/><br/>----Scores-----<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10 Good-looking picture.<br/><br/>Sound: 10/10 Fine, no problems.<br/><br/>Acting: 7/10 Not as good as the original. Liev Schreiber was an improvement over Matthew Lillard, but he did not make up for the presence of Pinkett-Smith or Jerry O'Connell. Sarah Michelle Gellar was a plus in her short performance, but Tori Spelling was the gaping black hole of non-acting one expects.<br/><br/>Screenplay: 6/10 The endless references to clichés in other films drags this down a bit. Some of the acting is sufficient to carry the story forward."

Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury.<br/><br/>This movie was not bad at all.

","That is exactly what it is. A sequel that doesn't suck. This continuation is actually as good as the origin of the quadrilogy (god I really hate that word, why not just call it a trilogy plus one). Anywho, you know what is next (sorry for sounding so self-important).<br/><br/>Basic Story Guide: <br/><br/>Two years after the Woodsboro murders, everyone from the original movie (who survived) have gotten on with their lives. While two collage seniors are attending a movie preview of ""Stab,"" the movie adaptation of the ""Woodsboro Murders,"" not just the event itself but a book written by Gale Weathers, both are killed by someone wearing the infamous ""Ghostface"" mask. Sidney Prescott is attending Windsor Collage along side Randy Meeks when she receives the news of the two murders and is adamant that this is just the beginning, while Randy is skeptical. After the third victim is found murdered, Gale sees a pattern: some of the names match up to victims of the first killing spree, and there is only conclusion, a copycat on campus and wanting to make a real sequel. Sidney is once again pitted against Ghostface, but by the end, not everyone who made it out of Woodsboro may not make it out of Windsor Collage alive.<br/><br/>Verdict: <br/><br/>While this movie is not as good as the Scream, it is (as the title implies) a sequel that does not suck. A rarity in the horror genre. Those who were attracted to Screams style of bloody violence, the meta humor, and the mystery of who-done-it, will love Scream 2 as much as the first."
"bernie369","5","1","1","14 July 2005"," A good sequel which parodies sequels
","To be honest, let me say first that though Scream 2 is a common sequel, I like it because it makes fun of itself. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson bring in some new characters like Sidney's new boyfriend Derek Feldman (well played by Jerry O'Connell) but also some already known characters get a bigger part this time. The best example is Cotton Weary (very believable played by Liev Schreiber), but also Randy Meeks (again cool performance of Jamie Kennedy) can be seen again.<br/><br/>Of course there some other new characters too but the you will soon recognize that the focus lies on Sidney, Dewey and Gale (Neve Campell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox).<br/><br/>I don't think it makes any sense watching it without having seen the first part cause there are many references to it.<br/><br/>In the very beginning of the movie Wes Craven also makes fun of or rather accuses the behaviour of the fans of splatter-movies. They are personated as violence-seeking almost mad crowd who can't wait to see some people getting slaughtered. A very shocking way how they are presented and it may be exaggerated but not that unrealistic. It makes you thoughtfully, but of course you don't have to deal with it and an also just enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>My résumé is that if you like Scream you'll also like this one, although the only thing that has been approved is the hairstyle of Courtney Cox."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","1","6","16","6 August 2000"," Very bad sequel
","Craven used to be known to make REAL horror movies. Sometimes they were experimentation horror films. But now he has fallen for Hollywood's love of cheap scares and loud, loud, loud soundtracks. This film only has one musical cue that isn't criminally loud noise. But it's music stolen from Hans Zimmer's Broken Arrow soundtrack. A soundtrack I love. This kind of made me annoyed the first, and only, time I saw this (well over 2 years ago).<br/><br/>The photography in this film is the worst I have ever seen. Almost everything that isn't in the immediate foreground is blurred and out-of-focus. Horror films offer so many opportunities for creativity in all areas of film production. But as this film is made to appeal to mass audiences the style has to be simple. Even terrible. <br/><br/>There is nothing worthwhile about this film and nothing to recommend. The part that I hate most seems to be what most people (for some reason) like the best. A class full of film students discusses if sequels are better than originals. That's it. You seethis IS a sequel, and they talk about sequels. Wow! So what?! That's the irony! And it's not worth a penny. I have never seen a more simpleminded and superficial so-called 'horror' film as bad as this. The fact that it thinks it's so cool just makes it worse. The true horror of this film is the horrifying ignorance to the audience. <br/><br/>Watch Urban Legend instead if you want to watch a Campus 'who's the killer?' flick. It's junk but it's better than this."

","They say that sequels rarely are better than the original, but this is one case where a sequel is better than the original. I had my doubts about Scream 2. With that being said, I was surprised. But what makes this film better than the original? First of all, we have better characters. Even though we have the same characters from the original, but to see them living life after a tragic event is quite interesting. Plus, we grow emotionally attached to the old characters. Which is to say that the new characters are good but we do not become emotionally attached to them. With that being said, main characters do die and that just comes to show that this film is not scared to do big things. One thing that made the first Scream work was the self awareness. Another thing is the mystery surrounding the identity of Ghostface. The original film made me surprised but this film made me even more surprised. Typically with sequels, they are absurd, but this film has no absurdity at all. This sequel manages to be more bloody than the original while still being suspenseful and an enjoyable film. A must watch."

More fun twists, another great cast, and just the same amount of gore certainly help propel the film from being a forgettable sequel, though the pacing is noticeably drawn out here.

","Scream 2 obviously isn't as amazing like the first film was, but it still managed to be a sequel that did a great job of continuing on from the first film.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is about a movie called Stab (a film based off the events of the first movie) that premieres one night, and two college students get murdered. This then triggers Sidney (Neve Campbell) as she is being tracked down from a killer that is trying to be a copycat. With the help of Dewey (David Arquette), Gale (Courtney Cox) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy), they must find out who this killer is before they end up dead.<br/><br/>Scream 2 was solid to watch. It had a pretty good plot with is creative twists. I liked how this time around a killer wanted to copy things and haunt everyone again. This is also the longest Scream film in the series, and pacing wise, it had a pretty smooth pace.<br/><br/>The cast was great. Campbell, Arquette, Cox, and Kennedy come back to deliver some really smooth performances. The new actors did a very good job as well. Liev Schreiber plays Cotton Weary who was the accused murderer of Sidney's mother. Jerry O' Connell plays Derek, who is Sidney's new boyfriend. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Cici, one of the victims the killer goes after. Lastly, Jada Pinkett, who is one of the two victims killed at the Stab premiere.<br/><br/>There were only two issues I had with the film. The first is Randy being killed off in a pretty dumb way. I liked the character of Randy, but they decided to have him be killed inside of a van in broad daylight. I thought that was incredibly frivolous.<br/><br/>The other issue I had was the killer reveal. There are two killers again, and one of them is a character named Mickey (Timothy Olyphant). This is a character we barely saw and barely knew of, and his reason was just to become famous in the media. So, to have him as one of the killers is pretty pointless. However, that does get fixed as you find out the other killer is Billy Loomis' mother. She wanted to get revenge for the death of her son, so she set everything up and was working with Mickey in order to get back at Sidney.<br/><br/>These two flaws don't necessarily destroy the film though. The first one could be ignored and the second one was fixed. So, at the end of the day, Scream 2 was an enjoyable continuation of the Scream saga."

","After the success of the original, the sequel entered development as quickly as possible. A year later, Scream 2 came out in theaters and turned a profit despite competition with James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic and while not as well received as the original, it's considered by many to be one of the best horror sequels as time went by.<br/><br/>A lot of time had passed since the events of Woodsboro, California, but a killer is on the loose once again only this time at a college in Ohio. Sidney, Randy, Dewey and the other college students including Cotton played by Liev Schreiber are being attacked and they must find out who the actual killer is before they'll end up being killed.<br/><br/>Scream 2 managed to be quite as good as the first although the original is still the best. However, before I can give this some praise there are some problems that brought the film down. First of all, the story is hit and miss. On a positive note, it does a nice job expanding on certain aspects of the first including having Billy Loomis's mother appear and it still managed to have some funny comedy and some scary chills that the original film offered. Also I like it's social commentary on sequels. Unfortunately, everything else is just a retread of the original with the killer reveal being not as fresh this time around. Even the pacing's not that good. Don't get me wrong. I liked the beginning and the climax of the film despite being somewhat predictable and cliched as it does bring some intensity when Sidney fights against Billy Loomis's mother and Mickey. Unfortunately, it's not very brisk enough and kind of dragged the film for a while.<br/><br/>That being said, everything else is still good. The acting, much like the original, is very good from all involved as Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and others including Liev Schreiber, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf, Jada Pinkett Smith give some very good performances as well. The characters are still likeable and even the new additions despite having limited screen time are still interesting enough. The direction is really neat, the cinematography is well spent and Marco Beltrami's score, much like the original, suited the atmosphere, suspense, and tone really well.<br/><br/>Overall, while Scream 2 lacks the spark and retreads the first film, it's still a worthy enough sequel. Check it out and you won't regret it."

And that's when we got Scream 2.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is Scream 1... In college. Let me ask you if this sounds familiar. A dragged-out, suspenseful start where Drew Barrymore gets killed. We get that, but with Jada Pinkett Smith in a movie theater. Remember how in the first movie the biggest suspect was the boyfriend? I will give this movie props for not doing exactly that, as it turns out the boyfriend isn't the killer, but, come on, we all saw that coming. Remember when we though Dewey died, but he didn't? Well, that happened in this one, too. But the worst similar plot point of them all is... THERE IS TWO KILLERS. AGAIN. Except this time, it's Timothy Olyphant, and Billy's (the killer from the first movie) mother. And guess what? There's a dragged-out climax, where when we think the killer's dead, she comes back to life and gets shot in the head. Isn't that just unique?<br/><br/>The best sequels are the ones that are original, while also keeping the first movie and continuity in mind. Toy Story 2, The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part 2. Scream 2 just takes that philosophy, rips it up into tiny little pieces, and throws it into the fireplace.

Now they must deal with a new set of ghostfacers determined to finish what the last started.<br/><br/>Keeping true to its roots, the film parodies the horror sequels that flowed out during the 80s and set up a new batch of rules in this stylish genre.<br/><br/>A few changes however is that Gale has been reduced back to her original obnoxious self who cares more for game and fortune then her ex boyfriend Dewey. Why reset the great chemistry between them? <br/><br/>Randy's still a virgin and they make jokes around that. Retread shows a lack of creativity and running out of ideas.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film makes an interesting link by all the victims having the initials of the victims staring in the first. A few issues rose to the surface using this format. Since this is the case why can't Dewey stop any of the murders? All they have to do is get a registry and find any students fitting the description and set a trap. Major plot hole.<br/><br/>The scenes I felt worked the best tensions was the play where they are rehearsing Cassandra. The mood is set with the music, flashing lights and the masks all nearly identical except for our beloved killer. <br/><br/>It even works on a personal level since Cassandra could see the tragedy that would befall and was powerless to stop it like our hero.<br/><br/>The other was when Sidney and her roommate has to sneak out if the police car before the killer awakes. I was sweaty bullets hoping and praying they would make it.<br/><br/>What I found disappointing is by the end it feels like it was making fun of the first film and getting caught up in the big reveal of the killer's identity that it didn't take enough time to development it.

The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. <br/><br/>Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise.<br/><br/>I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5?"

","70/100. Apparently Scream didn't get the message from earlier slasher movies that the sequel is supposed to be bad to average. What I really like about Scream 2 is that it doesn't try and be all that different and they for all intensive purposes cop to that fact in the movie by referencing it consistently even playing reenacted scenes from the previous years film. As if that point wasn't already shoved down our throats we are constantly reminded by multiple characters that sequels always are inferior. Why such the high grade? Because not only is the story just as scary and funny, but its characterization may even be superior. By the end of the film Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers is not the same person she was at all in first Scream, and you really feel for Sidney understanding her inner demons and reluctance of trust toward her college boyfriend after her fling with her psychopathic high school sweetheart. It was fun to see more than one character from a previous slasher film especially since I enjoyed all of the characters previously. One of the few teen slice and dice movies where you actually really pull for your favorite characters to come out alive. Liev Screiber is fantastic in an expanded role as the hard luck former lover of Mrs. Prescott looking to cash in on his misfortune of being wrongly accused for her death as detailed in the first Scream. Kevin Williamson writes his crass dialogue beautifully which really made me wonder why more characters haven't been fleshed out similarly before. I was a big fan of the opening which I felt was even better than the slightly over-the-top intro with Drew Barrymore. Although the final showdown was somewhat of a let down, scenes such as having to crawl past the killer to escape the pinned police car and Sarah Michelle Gellar's frightening encounter with Ghost face certainly gave off enough thrills. Admittedly not as good as the first, Scream 2 in my mind very well might be the best slasher sequel made to date."

","I had heard that this was an excellent sequel to the first Scream, and going in, I was expecting something good. And this delivered. It takes are the criticisms and satire of the first Scream to another level, questioning whether movies influence people's actions (in an ironic way), and railing on college life in general. It also brilliant in the way it references the first Scream, especially during the scene where Randy and Dewey are trying to find suspects, and they use ""sequel logic"" to narrow down the list. In other moments, the movie makes fun of itself in a similar way.<br/><br/>This movie is extremely well written (Kevin Williamson), with many memorable lines that manage to develop plot and have a greater significance. There is also an almost surrealist element in two scenes: When Jada Pinkett dies in the movie theater the mood goes from funny to incredibly disturbing in a two second twist and the scene where Neve Campbell is playing Cassandra in a rehearsal for her school play is probably the scariest in the movie, and I wish Wes Craven would have played up that image more.<br/><br/>The one thing that truly held me back from loving this movie, however, was the end. I would have liked it fine if the ""Micky"" twist had stood, but the one that follows it is ridiculous, and even though it is explained, unbelievable within the context of the story.<br/><br/>Overall though, it is a worthy sequel to an already excellent horror movie.<br/><br/>-Alex B."

","Well, Randy, you were right. This sequel definitely did not exceed the expectations of the first Scream. I did like the plot twist with Debbie Salt revealing herself to be Billy's mom. Once again, Neve Campbell does an excellent job portraying her role as Sidney Prescott and Jamie Kennedy as the movie geek yet comical, Randy Meeks. But, I was very disappointed about the fact that they killed off Randy was the biggest mistake. I thought the trilogy would have been much better if they let him live and get Sid and kill off either Gale or Dewey. Plus the dialogue was not too great and Mickey's motive was just plain stupid. Overall I'd give this a 6-6.5/10."
"jed-estes","9","0","0","18 August 2006"," Good Follow up
","This film is a decent follow up to the 1996 original. The reason this one is even half as good as the first one is because of returning director Wes Craven, and the cast of course who all graciously returned. The most disappointing thing about this film was the death of Jamie Kennedy's character Randy Meeks who I loved. After seeing the first Scream my life was forever touched by the lovable rants of Randy. I live my life by his teachings and still to this day shed a tear when I think of his demise. He was more than just a character to me, he was like family. When I was sitting in the dark lonely theater back in December 1997 watching this I shrieked in terror as the blade went into Randy and ended the magic that was his character. I was ticked. The film has it's moments though. I love the evolution of Sydney Prescot and think they took her in the right direction. I hate the fact that Courtney Cox and David Arqette survived this outing. i thought is was placeable in the first one but outrageous in this one. The over all dark town of this film seemed to jive well with the continuation of the first one's more pastel look. Don't think I do not like this movie, because I do. It like the first one defined who I am and I could never complain about that as I like me. I just feel this film could have let Randy live an had Dewey and Gail die."

","I love the Scream trilogy. The sequel to the terrific horror saga ""Scream"" was a good movie. I think that everyone should watch all three movies ""Scream 1, 2, 3"". All together they're a great set and great casting. However, I'd say that Scream 2 is my least favorite out of all three. But if you want to know the whole story it's a must see. One of the best things about this film is that Sarah Michelle Gellar is a part of the cast. She's a great actress and worth watching. She has one of the best death scenes in the movie. It's very important to watch the first one before Scream 2 and 3, you'll get more out of it if you do.

","""Scream 2"" is possibly the best horror movie sequel ever, and that's because it stays in touch with the ideas and plot structure of the first film, relying on the old clichés to give us another fresh and involving thriller. I'd even go so far as to say that this movie is superior to its predecessor, and that judgement lies with the character development and its comical treatment of the subject matter, while also being as cunning and inventive as ""Scream,"" keeping us at bay until the unexpected resolution.<br/><br/>""Scream 2"" is a parodical look at the first film, beginning with a special screening of the new movie ""Stab,"" which is based on the book ""The Woodsboro Murders"" written by Gale Weathers. At the screening, two college students are brutally murdered by a man in that same old ghost mask. Not that he/she would be easy to spot: the studio gave away ""Stab"" costumes to all the audience members, and everyone is running all over the place. The whole movie angle provides for some of the tension, because no one believes that the murders are interconnected, perpetuating the action.<br/><br/>Soon, news of the murder gets back to Sidney Prescott, now a college student, who consults Randy, also at college, on what he thinks is going on. She now has a potential boyfriend, Derek, who appears to genuinely care for her, and friends Mickey and Halle, typical college students who are put into the story for good measure.<br/><br/>Or are they? Like ""Scream,"" the sequel also makes everyone out to be a possible suspect through their actions and their words, which keeps the suspense unbearable in wanting to know who the killer is. As Sidney and others have their own opinions, reporter Gale Weathers, now a network reporter, retrieves her old ambitions and does everything to get the story, with exhonerated convict Cotton Weary, the man formerly accused of Sidney's mother's murder, chasing her for airtime. Not to mention the pesky reporter who looks up to Gale with every inch of her being.<br/><br/>The film's shock quotient is extremely high, keeping us involved and wanting to know who is going to get killed next. Most of the murdered characters are secondary, leading up to murders of certain important actors that point to other as the suspects. The plot has all the machinations and clichés of the first film, again using it to its advantage in propelling its plot forward while giving those old horror tactics a fresh new look.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie shine over the predecessor is the characterization of its characters. The Sidney of this movie is much stronger, much more stable than in the first movie, which provides a lot in keeping the movie going. Neve Campbell reprises her role, and does some of the best acting of the movie. The relationship between Deputy Dewey and Gale Weathers is intensified further here, and Courteney Cox and David Arquette are the perfect pair for the job. Cox especially shines here, bringing out more of Gale's ambitions which later become replaced with fear. Liev Schreiber portrays Cotton Weary, who really has nothing to do here but follow people around, but watch out for his chance to save the day.<br/><br/>Telling you anymore than I already have will spoil the movie, which is full of surprises and stunning twists. This movie has a more adult feel than the first, which will provide for even more entertainment to moviegoers. There is so much fun to be had with ""Scream 2,"" which is solid entertainment full of suspense and intelligence."

Sidney finds out about Randy's death, and Cotton is released from lack of evidence against him.<br/><br/>Sidney and her best friend,Hallie, are told that they will be moved to a safe location until the killer is found.

Then The set starts moving, and Derek is revealed still tied to the prop, drunk and out cold. Then as she begins to untie him, The killer steps onto the stage and pulls off his mask. Its Mickey, he pulls out a gun and says that without Derek there, hes been having to do all the killing that night. Sidney stops untieing Derek, Derek shouts that he not the killer and while swearing at Mickey, Mickey shoots him dead. As Mickey is explaining that he intends on blaming the movie for his actions, Gale walks in Followed by Debbie Salt who is holding a gun at her. Debbie salt tells them that she is Billy's mother. She then shoots Mickey down, Mickey shoots Gale, who falls into a large gap between the stage and the stairs leading to the audience's seats.<br/><br/>Sidney runs away backstage and starts making the sets and props fall on Debbie, who is trying to shoot her.

Cotton tells Sidney that Debbie does have a point. Sidney looks unbelievably at him. Then he says that the interview is looking pretty good right now. Sidney says to consider it done. Cotton shoots Debbie in the lung. Then as Sidney and Cotton are looking at Debbie, Gale appears and it helped out of the Gap by Cotton while Sidney picks up the other gun.

I think that the SCREAM movies have a way of making you really feel sorry for it's victims. I was really surprised when Sarah Michelle Gellar (Cici) was killed so early in the movie. In my opinion, Cici was my favorite character in the SCREAM 2 movie. I thought it was really cool how she was incredibly calm while she was on the phone with the killer. I really loved her death scene. I mean, to get pushed through a window, stabbed two times, and then thrown off of the balcony onto concrete. I mean, that was a death scene right there. I was surprised, but happy about Randy's death scene. I am not a really big fan of Randy, and when he died, I heaved a sigh of relief. I do have a few dislikes about SCREAM 2. I really did not like the whole acting thing for Sidney. I thought it was boring. I wasn't at all surprised with the killers. I knew right off that Debbie Salt would be a killer, but i didn't know her motive. It all fit together when I found out that she was Mrs. Loomis. If you look at Mickey in the classroom, you can just tell that he looks like a killer. So I was not at all surprised when Mickey and Debbie Salt were the killers.

","Recently channel four in the UK has been showing the Scream trilogy and after two years of not seeing the films it was nice to get to watch them again.<br/><br/>Scream 2 picks up a few years after the events of Scream. Scream 2 tries to do what the original did which was to come up with a fantastic and shocking opening, now while i like the idea of the killer sat amongst people wearing the same outfit i did not think the opening was quite as good as the originals.<br/><br/>The death scenes are a bit more gorier but very predictable. Something i don't always like in the script is that the killer always seems to fall down or seems to be clumsy, which is something i don't like because i think it becomes stupid and predictable.<br/><br/>Kevin Williams script offers new characters, new settings but nothing much more than that. Having seen the first you know or you can best guess that there will be two killers, one you may probably expect the other was a shock for me but a super ending and a better one to what Williams had originally written.<br/><br/>Wes Craven shows just why he's the master of suspense and horror by giving a good second helping of the Scream pie.<br/><br/>Worth the watch but don't be surprised by the predictable deaths."

","Most sequels are never as good as their predecessor, but Scream 2 really was a satisfying sequel to a creepy Scream. There is another series of murders, but this time Sidney Prescott and surviving friend Randy Meeks are in college. A killer is murdering more students, and it all began after the movie ""Stab"" was made, and it was a movie about what happened to Sidney and all the others killed in their high school days. Sidney is terrified. Jada Pinkett Smith plays a young women named Maureen who goes to see the movie ""Stab"", and it ends up being the last movie she ever sees. Duane Martin plays Joel Jones, Maureen's boyfriend, who also loses his life while going to see ""Stab"". Neve Campbell plays innocent Sidney Prescott, whose mother was raped and murdered and this killer is after her again! Courteney Cox plays chatty, in-your-face news reporter who is always at the scene. Deputy Dwight 'Dewey' Riley is a brave deputy who must help solve the murders, and he also develops a relationship with Gale Weathers. Elise Neal plays Sidney's best friend Hallie who is willing to be there for Sidney in these dark times. Jamie Kennedy plays Randy Meeks, horror movie expert, Woodsboro killing survivor and comical friend. You'll jump and be scared when you watch Scream 2!"

","A continuation of the first movie, you do not need to have seen the original but it would help to setup the finer points of the relationships of the characters.<br/><br/>Things start when a movie about the happenings of the first film is released in the theaters. Body counts begin to tally and so does the investigation. The list of suspects grows, most of the old characters make it back. (Even one of the dead ones makes a cameo. Durring a party scene at a ""martini mixer"", Mathew Lillard is in the background. Blonde hair, glasses. Apparently he and Neve were dating. Some guys get all the luck.)

","With Scream Wes Craven proved once again he's one of the world leading horror directors, but Scream 2 is much better to me than the original. The atmosphere is more cheerful (I actually never considered it to be horror; my attention is more cuffed to Neve Campbell). I'm not going to encounter the good directress, nice script etc. I knew it will on the highest level long before watching (Like in Craven's all movies). I can't have any gripe at all. Perfect sequel! Much comes to Campbell, but thanks to this film I know such a brilliant actor like Timothy Olyphant and all the others closer to leading ones were either already my favourites or they became after Scream 2. Neve Campbell here god, it's not even the half of enough to say she's good. She's something much-much and much better than just a pretty face and nice actress. She makes you crazy. As you watch you want to help her all the time. She's able so save the most condemned to failure project, but here as we also had Kevin Williamson involved, this project was condemned to become classic and make famous everyone connected with it. Wes Craven is obviously the only director that would never disappoint. I know that since first watched ""The snake and serpent"". He manages doing sensitive movies. See ""Music of the heart"" to make sure. Highly recommended! 10 out of 10. Very good!"

","Scream 2 It has been two years since the tragic events at Woodsboro. Sidney Prescott and Randy Meeks are trying to get on with their lives, and are currently both students at Windsor College. Cotton Weary is out of prison, and is trying to cash in on his unfortunate incarceration. Gale Weathers has written a bestseller, ""The Woodsboro Murders,"" which has been turned into the film, ""Stab,"" starring Tori Spelling as Sidney. As the film's play date approaches, the cycle of death begins anew. Dewey Riley immediately flies out of Woodsboro to try to protect Sidney, his ""surrogate sister."" But in this sequel to the 1996 horror film, the number of suspects only goes down as the body count slowly goes up! <br/><br/>'Scream 2' is a fun slasher. It is faster than the original but also much more diabolical, which isn't good in this situation. Neve Campbell once again gives a good performance as Sidney, and other good performances include Sarah Michelle Gellar, Courtney Cox and David Arquette.<br/><br/>As stated in my one line summary, 'Scream 2' is a fun, bloody slasher that goes over-the-top sometimes but it still has a nice momentum and execution. The death scenes are good,particularly CiCi Cooper's scene. I enjoy Kevin Williamson's style of writing, particularly in this film.<br/><br/>So, In the end, 'Scream 2' ends up being everything it wants to be... a fun, bloody, silly slasher...<br/><br/>3/4 <br/><br/>R- strong, bloody horror violence and language"
"malkane316","8","0","0","25 November 2004"," Quick Reviews!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>Not as good as the original, let's get that out of the way. It is part of a trilogy, and sequels are for the most part inferior. Wes Craven knows this, lets get that out of the way. But when the fans want more, and when the story isn't finished, sequels are inevitably made. But it is still a good movie, still better than any over the other teen slasher movies of the period, and retains many elements which made the original so good.<br/><br/>OK, now that we understand Wes Craven knew exactly what he was doing, we can discuss the good and bad points. Bad- too many unnecessary characters, though strangely many of them are not killed or even attacked, and most of them do not do much, the twists are too unpredictable to work well, and it is maybe too short. Now the good stuff- each performance is good, though the Killer (s) is (are) too over the top. Neve is excellent again, and i'm not only saying that because i'm a fan, but she has grown as an actress now coping with the fame Scream brought her, ironically mirroring the fame Sydney gets from what happened in Woodsboro. The Arquettes are both very good, Randy is very funny again, and the scares are pretty good. The police car scene stands out. Again the film deals with mistrust and uncertainty, like most of Craven's films, and we sympathies with Sydney's struggles- it seems inevitable that she will never put these events behind her, and that it will be a great struggle for her to get close to anyone- her relationship with her new boyfriend shows this (played brilliantly by O-Connell). The script is sharp, and there are many in-jokes. <br/><br/>Overall it is a good film, but a continuation a story because the impact the characters of the first film had was so big, we had to see how they would move on. It cannot be as original or fresh (grr) as the first film, but that does not matter, that's not the point. 8 out of 10."

","What? Another Scream? I gotta prep up...<br/><br/>1. Lock all doors. 2. Cut off all phone lines 3. Wear kelvar jacket and that mythril stuff in LOTR<br/><br/>That should do it.<br/><br/>OK, this movie was good, but if people are looking for more of a freaky time than the first, don't get your hopes up. Scream 2 starts off with the traditional great first scene, centering around a couple who go to see the premier of Gale Weathers' movie ""Stab."" And of course, they are both done in by a teen slasher wearing the same mask...it was y, but not as y as our good friend Casey Becker...<br/><br/>This is how I saw the movie: It was placed into two separate movie plots, all jointing together in the end. One plot followed Gale, Dewey and Randy, three survivors of the Woodsboro massacre. The other follows, of course, Sydney, her new boyfriend, Derek, Derek's friend Mickey, and one of her friends Hallie. (Yea, I know, Syd, Billy, Stu, and Tatum, haha). One scene starts with Gale, Dewey, and randy discussing the s and, of course, Randy receives a cell call, and who is it? The killer. And as Randy keeps the killer talking, Gale and Dewey interrogate everyone in the park talking on a cell phone. And it ends in Randy's and the killer's escape. Yes, Randy was killed, everyone. I bet you wish you got to stab Jamie Kennedy like he did.<br/><br/>The plot then thickens. Gale and Dewey are then attacked in the school by the killer and Dewey is killed (?). As Sydney begins to evacuate the town, the killer attacks her as well She escapes into the school, and Hallie is killed. (Like Scream 1, yea...) Sydney is chased to the play stage where she finds Derek tied to a cross (!) and is chased by the masked killer. The killer turns out to be Mickey, and he soon accuses Derek of being his partner in crime, and kills him before he can free himself.<br/><br/>Sydney then engages Mickey and evades him long enough for Mickey to introduce Sydney his real accomplice, and its the MOTHER of all surprises. No, its not Mickey's mother, and its not Sydney's mother, its BILLY'S MOTHER! How could you guess that? Gale is shot and so is Mickey and the old accused killer, Cotton Weary, comes to the rescue and kills Mrs. Loomis. Dewey is then found to be alive barely to end the movie.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie, but the fact that the killer is unguessable is stupid. Both killers were not good choices, it would be cool to see something unexpected, like another ""fake "" thing that might include Randy, maybe, but I guess I have no say. Also, many of the characters could be compared to the characters in Scream 1:<br/><br/>Derek - Billy (sorta) Mickey - Stu Hallie - Tatum<br/><br/>which is not something I liked. Also, they did not do the greatest of jobs with the phone scenes with Cici and Randy. Not too spooky. Fear-seekers should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"alainenglish","Null","0","0","25 August 2004"," Critic-proof sequel (spoilers)
","""Scream"" (1996) was such a massive success that within a year, this sequel was made.  Given the clever, subversive nature of the first film, this sequel is almost critic-proof.  If anyone says this film is worse than the original, that would be countered by the idea that this is the point.  While not having the original's depth, this follow-up is equal to it's predecessor in term of shocks, suspense and cheeky humour.<br/><br/>The action has moved from Woodsboro to Windsor College.  The events of the original have been turned into a film, ""Stab"", and it is at a preview of this film that we meet two black Windsor students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) who bemoan the lack of African Americans in horror films.  Within the noisy atmosphere of the cinema showing, the pair are abruptly cut to shreds.  Pretty soon the bodies pile up and Sidney (Neve Campbell) and other Woodsboro survivors find themselves hunted by a copycat killer...<br/><br/>The film's status as a sequel precipitates an early classroom debate on that very same subject.  The only sequel unanimously agreed to being better than it's original is ""The Godfather Part II"".  All others, by their very nature. can only be considered inferior.  Later Randy (Jamie Kennedy) engages Dewey (David Arquette) in a short discussion on the rules of the horror movie sequel, where they also debate possible suspects.<br/><br/>In the line-up this time round are Cotton Weary (Liev Schrieber), a former murder suspect exonerated by the revelations of the last film.  Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), on the hunt for the prize-winning scoop, Sidney's boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell) film student Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and Gale's fan Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) are all under suspicion.  The script by Kevin Williamson (who penned ""Scream"") keeps things tight and plausible without convoluting his logic.  The killers, when revealed, are interesting surprises.  The main killer is a clever nod to the ""Friday the 13th"" films, while the sidekick turns the point of ""Scream"" completely on its head and offers to blame the movies for his actions.<br/><br/>Cox and Arquette's onscreen courtship has lost none of its chemistry and Neve Campbell gives the film a strong central core as Sidney.  Jerry O'Connell gets a great singing scene as her ill-fated boyfriend, and Jamie Kennedy is once again superb as loveable geek Randy.  Metcalf, Schrieber and Olyphant are on fine form, and British actor David Warner has a good cameo as Sidney's drama teacher.  ""Buffy"" star Sarah Michelle Gellar, playing a student, adds to the irony of the piece by running away from the killer instead of taking the fight to him.<br/><br/>Wes Craven ratchets up the tension in style, milking the most out of the plot twists.  The film (well scored once more by Marco Beltrami) is shot well around the ancient, red-bricked college campus that provides a creepy setting for the carnage.<br/><br/>""Scream 2"" is a superb sequel, and was followed by the comparatively average ""Scream 3""."

","Scream 2 was the best movie of the trilogy by far. With the hippest cast, cleverest plot and thrills chills and spills around every corner, Scream 2 not only surpassed the original but was not able to be beat by the sequel that follows it.<br/><br/>Once again, Kevin Williamson comes through with a fantastic script with edgy plot lines and twists. The identity of the killer or killers will keep you guessing to the very end. David Arquette, Courtney Cox and Never Campbell reprise their roles of Dewey, Gale and Sidney flawlessly, and Leiv Schreiber, Laurie Metcalf, Jamie Kennedy and Jada Pinkett round off the cast with essential roles played to a ""T""<br/><br/>Wes Craven delivers yet again when Sidney Prescott finds herself amidst killings again at while away at Windsor College. The killings coincidentally coincide with the release of ""Stab"", a movie based on the book written by Gale Weathers on the killings two years ago at Woodsboro. Dewey soon appears to find out what is going on and to make sure Sidney and the others are protected as the killings increase until the slam-bang finish which is sure to go down as one of the best in horror movie history.<br/><br/>Overall, 9/10"

If you enjoyed the first one, you will like this one just as well.  The body count is a little higher in this movie and of course everything is a little drawn out,as sequels tend to do. However, the clever acting, dialogue, and scary scenes are all still there.

","I tend to think of Scream 2 as a comedy. The first Scream, obviously, was a by-the-books horror film that worked, because it knew its own tricks, but fell into them anyway. Very post-modern. But Scream 2, in my opinion, is more of a comedy. The opening scene at the movie theatre is a hilarious send-up of the weird phenomenon that the original film became. The movie satirizes Hollywood and the media, showing how truly ridiculous it can be when the press latches on to a particular tragic story, blowing it out of proportion until it becomes less about the people involved and more about the very fact that it even happened. I, for one, loved many of the little in-jokes (""it was my head on Jennifer Aniston's body""). Granted, we'll have to explain them to our kids when they catch it on USA twenty years from now, but no one ever said it was timeless. And yes, the ending is weird and forced (though i do love the line, ""bob dole on the witness stand, IN MY DEFENSE"") and lacks the surprise of the original. It certainly has its faults and doesnt live up to the original in many ways, but its still an entertaining ride. <br/><br/>7/10 stars"

"VenomX","6","0","0","6 December 2002"," Feels rushed, lacks real innovation *SPOILERS*
","*SPOILER WARNING*<br/><br/>The main rule I have when it comes to sequels is this: do not release them too early or it'll feel rushed and do not release them too late or my interest in the franchise will decline.  Scream 2 breaks the former rule, released a year after the original, it's goal is to spoof horror movies by having a killer imitate them in his killings.  In the sequel, it's goal is to have the killer imitate horror movie sequels.  Sound confusing? It is.<br/><br/>One thing that most horror movie sequels have in common is that they all drag us through the same path that the original did, and end up being really weak.  Add that to the already rushed nature of this film and we have ourselves a film that pales in comparison to the original.  The part that these films always contained that entertained me is the entire ""who is the killer?"" feeling, I actually found it much more present in this one than the original, but in the end, it all falls apart.<br/><br/>The killers in the end are revealed to be two very underdeveloped characters, which destroyed the ending for me.As soon as the killer took off his mask, my initial thought was ""Who is that?"", then ""OK, I think I know who they are, what was their motives?"".  Turns out that character's motive was that his accomplice would pay his tuition if he dressed up as a Ghostface and killed people, (on a lighter note, wouldn't if have been a little easier just to rob a convenience store? Less blood involved).  His accomplice turned out to be an annoying reporter-type character that was using that disguise to ""get closer"" to the university and get revenge against Sydney (very underdeveloped motive here).<br/><br/>On a positive note, this film does build up the suspense quite well and the whole ""Whodunit?"" theme is very much present (I started pointing fingers to several characters throughout the film).  We do get more gore than present in the original and a general sense that the writers were serious about the whole ""sequel"" thing in the beginning of the film.  <br/><br/>A little disappointing, definitely suffers from all the flaws that sequels do have.  Not as groundbreaking as the first one was, still a decent watch though.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

Suddenly survivors of ""Scream"" are brought together when a copycat killer attacks them and murderers classmates. Like in the first film you are left guessing who the killer or killers are until the end. The film is darker than its predesessor and lacks a bit of the magic which made ""Scream"" such a fun, thrilling and original film.  The infamous phone voice was dull this time around, not scary or interesting as it was in the first one.  The ending is also a little off.  While I find it reasonable or exceptable that Mrs. Loomis,(mother of killer Billy Loomis from part 1), was the brains behind her plan for revenge, it wasn't shocking as the revealing of the killers was in the first movie.  The first film tricked you until the end and made two likeable characters turn out to be deranged sickos which made it more effective.  In this film it was just like, 'oh okay your the killers'.

"headfulofghosts126","Null","0","0","31 July 2002"," Not bad
","Over the years my opinion of Scream 2 has gone back and forth. Initially I loved the movie, minus the last ten minutes. Then I'd watch the original and realize just how inferior the second film was. No days, I can appreciate the good along with the bad when it comes to the second film in the trilogy.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good: the cinematography. The film looks great. The scale has been upped from its predecessor. In fact, this is probably the sharpest looking one in the set. There's also a great deal of effort involved in moving the returning characters forward so that they're not just rehashing the first film. There are a few good surprises (the murder in the van), a really suspenseful scene that outdoes anything from the previous film (the cop car), and most importantly a respect for the previous film. Scream 2 is aware of what it is and what it is not. It relishes in the fact that its a sequel.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. Remember what I said about moving the returning characters forward? The only problem with that is that the new characters have absolutely nothing to do. Other than Derek, Sid's new boyfriend, none of them get much screen time at all. I can't decide if this was intentional or accidentally brilliant. Y'see, if Scream is all about cliches than that's one of the biggest: characters who are introduced simply to die. Was Mr. Williamson aware that's what he was doing? Doubtful, but in that respect it works. There are a few plot lines that are never really explored. They start out with the copycat killer scenario with the murderer leaving clues through names. Yet after the meeting in the police station about this, we never hear about it again. What was the purpose? Then there's the atrocious excuse for a climax. Did anybody buy the killers in this film? You've got someone who was barely in ten minutes of the movie and another character who until her entrance didn't even exist to the audience! Very, very disapointing. The best part of the killers' identities in the original was that you were expecting only one. So when he was revealed you'd spent the whole film going back and forth on whether or not he did it. Then enter killer #2 and it's a whole other surprise. Infinitely satisfying. If they'd wanted to shock us this time, they shouldn't have stuck to such a formula. We were expecting two killers. Silly me, I was expecting a character who had been relevant in the movie as well...<br/><br/>    Scream 2 really shines compared to the film that follows it. Scream 3 is nothing more than the kinds of movies this series set out to parody. There's also another interesting aspect of Scream 2. It has a built in defense mechanism. To say it's not as good as the original almost feels like that's exactly what they wanted. They can just say, ""Exactly. That's the point. Sequels suck."" I'm not sure they thought their film sucked, but it's an interesting excuse. Bottom line: WAY better than the modern teen slashers that followed it, but not quite as effective as the original. You could do worse."

","This movie is the sequel from that scary movie ""Scream"" that has started a new generation of horror movies. This sequel is probably the best sequel I have seen in years. I am a big fan of this movie from part 1 to 3, too bad the trilogy didn't win any awards. But still, it's fun to watch and really suspense. When I first saw Scream, Neve has become my fave. actress and when I found out that theres a sequel, I can't wait to see it. I bought it on video long time ago and still I don't get tired of watching because another fave. actress of mine is there also who is Sarah Michelle Gellar. The chasing scenes are really great, probably the best parts of the movie. Also the beginning of the movie is also good, even though Jada was in first 15mins. of the movie. I think its still worth it to be part of it. The cast are really good, plus another applaud for the killers. For all those people who didn't see this movie yet, go rent this movie. It's really good that will leave you screaming for more! byebye"

I think he eared sidney's trust  by the end of this movie some people die well duh i mean some major people die like RANDY but he came back in scream 3(on videotape) and helped sidney and friends out by explaining ""the rules"" All i have to say about this movie VERY GORY VERY BLOODY VERY GOOD!!!!!!!

","the thing people don't realise with the scream trillogy is it is just that - a trilogy, like star wars, it was planned years before it was released. Kevin Williamson wrote the first, then the second, then the third - each encompasing a different hart of the overall teen-horror-slasher cliche`.<br/><br/>First off - scream, was a turning poitn for hollywood horror - a well known cast of good lookings, a twisted plot and the typical elements of a slasher. the entire movie was a parody of both horror and itself, lining up and chopong down cliche` after cliche`, then came scream 2.<br/><br/>Scream 2, lampooned one of the most despised artocies in the horror field - the sequal.  everyone knows that horror sequals suck so to try and get somewhere they always take on a different angle - trying to be more... horrific then the original.  Scream 2 does this - it drops an octave on the comedy and sarcastic aspects of the first, and turned up the volume on the evilness, if you will, on the events.  Drew Barrymore was disturbingly realistic as scream's first, but it is the faces of the cinema patrons that watch upon maureen, Scream 2's second victim - and it is things like this that give a more realistic view.  Scream 2 gives us a more heart pulling and gut wrenchingly realsitic view. some people have complained that there is no character development - there doesn't need to be.  the victims are selected due to their monikas Casey ""Cici"" Cooper, Maureen, Steven, ect - the names are the significance to the plot, not who they are. Scream 2 is a completely different film to scream - sure poeple discard it as the ""typical sequal"" but it is worthy and differt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Scream - Parody<br/><br/>Scream 2 - Realism<br/><br/>Scream 3 - Camp - thats the order and theme associated with each"

","This film is way better than all the other countless teen slasher movies being created out there but in terms of the sequel to the great Scream, it's not like its daddy.<br/><br/>The Scream series is almost directly responsible for reviving the horror genre with movies full of teens and masked psychos who always keep their identity sealed until the finale. After Scream, every horror movie copied its formula, hired hot teen actors, and made it a guessing game of who the killer would be. After a while it got too tiring. Now that the trend is dying off and movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween are pumping out more sequels this year, everyone can thank God that movie studios quit ripping off this great series. Sure, Scream started it all, but you have to realize that Scream is THE teen slasher of the '90s. It's the only slasher series that's actually worth a damn, and it's not the movie's fault that other people copied it to death. This series was almost ruined by imitators, making the audiences blame this series.<br/><br/>The story is a little different here in Scream 2. The heroine Sidney has graduated and gotten out of Woodsboro to a secluded college. The other survivors have gotten on with their lives, too. Gale the reporter got rich from a tell-all book, Dewey deals with his new limp, and Randy coincidentally attends Sidney's college (what are the odds?). When a new movie called Stab opens, which is the film counterpart to the events at Woodsboro and Gale's book, the past comes back again as another ghost killer stalks Sidney's college buds.<br/><br/>This movie delivers on all that Randy promises in the trailer. The body count is bigger, but some of the deaths are inconsequential unlike in Scream when the deaths were major characters. The death scenes are only more elaborate due to the new volume of blood. But compared to Drew Barrymore's scene in the first, this can't hold a candle to that. And the killer(s) should never be assumed dead because are they ever?<br/><br/>This movie may seem like a pointless attempt to cash in on the money from the first, especially since not even a year had passed since the first opened, but keep in mind this is a trilogy. Just like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Not everyone will be satisfied with this. Taking the characters from Scream and shipping them out of Woodsboro takes something out of the  film. Woodsboro was a small town where terrible things were happening and everyone had something to hide. With great scenery and people, the setting was almost a character in itself in the first movie. Now that is all gone, replaced by a college campus. The set-up to murder is all the same here, even the killer's voice, but the scenes lack the impact they had in the first. The first had a better set-up. Most murders were out in the middle of nowhere. These occur on a campus with hundreds of kids about.<br/><br/>This movie jokes about sequels never surpassing the original. This movie only helps prove that, but is still definitely worth viewing. It can't beat Scream, but it can almost match it. As part two of a trilogy this movie does just fine. But don't expect it to be an improvement."

The movie's many lapses into false gore, false pathos and false sentimentality are probably necessary evils, and in any case they don't detract from the fun.<br/><br/>Things like ""It was my head, but Jennifer Aniston's body,"" and ""At least you were played by David Schwimmer,"" and that bitchy dissection of the latest Party of Five episode by two sorority girls, will all sail sadly over the heads (beneath the dignity?) of art house types who wouldn't be caught dead watching a sitcom.  But there are other things they might get. There's the cell phone/cordless phone theme: Also, caller ID makes its first appearance in a movie in Scream 2 -- there's none of the anachronistic call-tracing nonsense we still see in other movies.   (FBI agent whispers desperately: ""Keep him on the line for another 45 seconds, for chrissake, we've almost got him!"" -- and in real life  the rest of us know who's calling on the first ring.)"

However, the score is much better than the one for the original (listen to the CD, & you'll see what I mean).  It isn't just that it sounds like 'Broken Arrow' - Hans Zimmers' music for that film was tracked in, using the theme for John Travolta's cool villain as the theme for Dewey.  Ho ho.  Although it wasn't used too well (overused in fact), don't go blaming the whole score, as the rest of the original music (by Marco Beltrami) is in fact better than his music for the first one."
"Ellbelle","Null","0","0","24 April 1999"," Falling short of expectations
","While the first Scream was cleverly written, Scream 2 falls short of expectations. This is good film, don't get me wrong, but, at times, the 'we're taking the rip out of horror films' lines, especially from Randy, wear a bit thin. The script is well written but does tend to be very similar to other films of its genre, such as 'I know what you did last summer', and its use of teen style language may appeal to some viewers, but others may find it tedious. The murder scenes are well choreographed and executed (if you don't mind the pun) and are seemingly authentic. What lets this film down is its choice of murderers. I won't let on (for anyone who hasn't seen the film) but the characters are somewhat under developed and in the case of the second killer, well, they could have placed any character in that role and the effect would have fairly similar. I cannot fault the acting, but in this film it was the unlikely character of Randy who shone. Jamie Kennedy's performance was superb; it wasn't his fault that some of his lines were shoddy. This movie also belonged to Courtney Cox, who, although tremendous, did play the 'psycho-Barbie newsgirl' a little too harshly at some points. Nevertheless, this is a great movie despite its faults and is well worth seeing."

The best thing about them is knowing that the killer is one of the main characters and trying to figure out who he/she is. The sequel definitely has more blood and my favourite scene was in the police car. The downfall of both the movies is that they are both very predictable and had me and my friends shouting at the characters, for example, somebody gets a weird phone call in the middle of the night when there's loads of murders going on, so they go outside and look around (giving the killer time to get inside the house) and then they go back in and lock all the doors so they are trapped.

I would like to point out that the opening death scenes in this movie are a little better than the first, because of the way the first victim dies.  Now that was clever.

But anyway, it tries very hard and mostly succeeds. It is very good, and parts of it are as good as Scream, just none are better. (Gale's chase scene in the recording studio, and the cop car scene, are almost there, but not quite.) The new members of the cast are less entertaining as their predecessors, but the focus is on Sidney, Gale, Dewey and Randy for the most part, leaving the others with smaller parts. But they are still good: Jerry O'Connell in particular overshadows Skeet Ulrich, who for some reason girls find attractive and talented. Elise Neal (Hallie) can't beat Rose McGowan, but she is still delightfully spunky. Timothy Olyphant is downright bland as Mickey, compared to the over-the-top Matthew Lillard. Anyway, the in-jokes have increased, and they are still funny, but the tone doesn't hold out through the whole movie. Late in the film, the plot weighs it down and it forgets to be funny. The scares are still there though. The only other complaint is that the killer(s) is underwhelming and doesn't live up to the shocking ending to the first one. But oh well.

","The first time I saw this, I liked it better that the first ""Scream"" because it seemed like this one wasn't nudging you in the ribs the whole time trying to show you how scary it was. (It wasn't.) But after a recent reviewing, I realized that this over-caffeinated sequel suffers from exactly the same reasons the first one did.<br/><br/>1. Too much fat. i.e. Too many needless characters clogging up the screen only to provide fodder for the tired ""guess who the killer is"" routine., and so the marquee will be filled with recognizable names. I've complained for many a year about how these post-""Scream"" films are packed with the latest teen actors who are only in this new horror market to beef up their resumes. ""Scream 2"" in particular has an over-abundence of inneffectual appearances, meaning way too much of the overrated Sarah Michelle Gellar, and not enough of the underrated Aphrodite of the silver screen Rebecca Gayheart. (She really is cute.)<br/><br/>2. The guessing game.  Guessing who the killer was in the first ""Scream"" worked because it was kind of unexpected. Unfortunately it's a device that can only be used once effectively. Being a cinematic technique that relies primarily on suprise, it dosen't work if the audience is expecting one of the characters to be the killer. But since everyone who went to see this knew that one of Sidney's friends was the killer, and that the climax has to be bigger than the last, the ""Guessing-Game"" concept becomes a self-defeating one when you realize that since everyone is a suspect, logically it's impossible to suprise the audience no matter who ends up being the killer.<br/><br/>3. The ""hip"" factor.  I suppose the constant mentions of other horror movies is intended to be a form of tribute. In the first ""Scream"" that worked to a certain extent because the characters FELL PREY to the cliches that they were making fun of. In this movie however, these references seem more like name-dropping. Here the characters argue (in a classroom scene so self-consciously forced it makes me cringe every time I see it) about whether sequels are lame. In the end, it's the MOVIE ITSELF that falls pray to this argument, not the characters. ""Scream 2"" doesn't just nudge, but practically SHOVES the viewer in a desperate attempt to show how ""clever"" it's being, almost giving it the attitude that it's above its subject matter.<br/><br/>Still, in spite of my rambling, this isn't a failiure. Neve Campbell is intelligent enough to make for a great heroine. You always want her to survive. That's the primary factor in this series' success. Also, there's a great opening sequence in a movie theatre that seems similar to the inspired chaos of Italian filmmaker Dario Argento.<br/><br/>Not bad, but I have a feeling this film, and any others in this series will eventually suffer the same fate of the sequels of other horror franchises ""The Howling"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in that they will just be forgotten."

The climatic showdown and the revelation of the killer was a huge dissapointment. Although the acting was super in this film by every single person, the film just lacked depth and creativity.

","I enjoyed ""Scream 2"" for the most part. It does some things right, but some things wrong as well. The right thing it does is that the characters who did survive the first one are smarter and know a lot more about the situation they are in. Also, like the first dwelled on scary movies, this one dwells on sequels.The clever script and direction is all there, and yet there are problems. The movie doesn't have the same scary settings as the first one, like the house at the memerable finish of ""Scream."" The killer is also more predictable, especially for people who saw the orginal. Still, the blood and gore , and witty screen writing, direction and performances are still enough to make this movie enjoyable.

","Scream 2 is glossier, sassier, slicker, classier and gorier than the original, but the elements that made Scream such a monumental film are lacking, not suprising as the film itself defines sequels as inferior. The intense and constant self-referencing that made Scream so talked about are exploited to the full, but this becomes irritating after a certain point, and you get the feeling it is all an excuse to give some glory to the whole Hollywood clique (why else would Courteney Cox refer to Jennifer Aniston) and to be honest was not the strongest aspect of the original. What made the original so strong was not so much the shocking nature of the murders but the randomness and unexpectedness of them, and more than anything the guessing game of whodunnit which very few people will have cracked. Scream 2, however, is nowhere near as clever, the murderers turn out to be coincidential characters who never would have been suspected and the final scene which could have been memorable turns into a bit of a farce. In terms of jumpiness, gore and beatiful women, Scream 2 rocks but otherwise it is a bit of a disappointment. The Scream saga will no doubt continue but by definition they will never scale the heights of the Scream itself."
"Gen S2rt","9","0","0","17 January 1999"," A good sequel, but not to outshine the original (what sequel does?)
","""Scream 2"" is pretty good when compared to the original, which many sequels aren't, but like the man says, sequels are by definition inferior films, so at least this one wasn't THAT inferior. In this film, a series of copycat murders are happening around Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the new killer starts coming after her and the other Woodsboro survivors. One thing I missed while watching this was the occasional laugh from the first one. This one had a couple of good lines, but ""Scream"" was definitely funnier, making fun of its own kind of movie. The funniest part in either film still remains as the moment in ""Scream"" when the killer is coming up behind Randy (JAMIE Kennedy) as he watches ""Halloween"" and says ""Jamie, look behind you!"" (referring to Jamie Lee Curtis). The acting in this film is not quite as good as it was in the original, but wasn't bad. Dewey (David Arquette) had a couple of moments of overdoing it, but not too many. The main problem with the film was the 'who's the killer' mystery.  There are more suspects to deal with, and the filmmakers seemed worried that if the killer's character is developed too much before revealing that they are the killer, then people will figure it out prematurely. As a result, when the killer is revealed, perhaps you didn't see it coming, but you aren't really shocked that this person could be a killer because you don't really know much of anything about them. One thing you start to learn during the movie is that just because someone was involved in the first ordeal, it doesn't mean that they aren't a possible suspect now, nor does it necessarily mean they aren't a potential victim.  Depending on how suspicious you are of people, there are countless numbers of suspects in the film, and to a really on-guard person, just about anyone in the movie is a suspect, which makes it really hard to identify the killer.  There was one thing I didn't like about the movie, and one character was murdered who I still think should have survived. I really can't see from here how they are planning to make ""Scream 3"" after this film seemed to burn the bridge to another sequel. It isn't necessary, seeing as how the same characters (mainly Sidney) have gone through the same type of ordeal twice, which is just on the edge of plausibility.  Maybe it's just so they can call it a ""trilogy"", but it really wouldn't be, because there really is a difference between a trilogy and a film with two sequels. In general, one sequel is enough and maybe pushing it, and a second sequel is almost always too far.  ""Scream 2"" is still scary, and may even be as scary as the first, although the opening scene of ""Scream"" is still the scariest of it all. This sequel doesn't make the same mistake many sequels to good films make, which is abandoning suspense altogether when it is too busy going all out with what it may have held back on in the first film, which in this case would have been as much gruesome death as possible. While it does have this extra gore (obviously it's going to -- this is a horror movie, after all) it still manages to have the same suspense that made the first one terrifying. If you loved the first film, you'll probably like this one too. This is still a good movie, but the first one, as always, was the best."

"Dawson-9","Null","0","0","2 January 1999"," Wes Craven's most mature film
","Director Wes Craven is best known as the master of suspense and horror. Many of his films are extremely inventive, but they have failed in many ways- do to unbalanced dialogue and acting. In my opinion Craven's films were neither suspenseful or horrifying, except for how bad they were. I had made up my mine that Wes Craven was a very over-rated horror director, producing more 'bombs' than 'five-stars'. However, I viewed SCREAM and was surprised at how the inventive camera angles and creative script had made me tense throughtout the entire film. Even more so in SCREAM 2, which is a film that changed my viewpoint on the director. Studying the film many times, I have come to understand many of the human emotions that Wes Craven has incorporated into it. Horror movies must be more than just blood and gore to make it scary, you need the human emotion. If you can't feel or relate to a character, ""who cares if they die?"" In SCREAM 2, you do feel for and relate to the characters and are horrifed (hopefully- or problems may be setting in!) when they get killed off. Unlike the opening scene of the first SCREAM, nothing in this movie was as disturbing, which made it more entertaining. There are many scenes in SCREAM 2 which are bound to become classic and imitated time and time again. The camera angles are well done, the acting is definitely convincing, and the music is tense. If you appreciate these qualities in a horror film, then you will enjoy SCREAM 2, and understand why it is (in my opinion) Wes Craven's most mature film and has truly established him as the master of his craft."

","SCREAM 2 is a prime example of true downfall of the horror movie genre. People may say Kevin Williamson has revitalized the whole dead teen genre, but he is completely playing it out. First of all, I liked the original SCREAM, but I think there is definitely no need for a sequel or dare I say, trilogy.  What's the point of having a trilogy that parodies slasher movies if it doesn't really do justice? SCREAM 2 has all sorts of movie references to movies like NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, HOUSE 2: THE SECOND STORY and FRIDAY THE 13th, but does the movie itself parody the horror genre well? No it doesn't.  There's a whole scene in which a group of film students talk about sequels that surpassed their originals, like THE GODFATHER 2, ALIENS, and T2,but they don't even explain why they were better. The whole movie itself is a dumb suspense movie with no suspense and predictable.  The scares in this movie are all cheap and predictable.  The killer doesn't do anything but stab, and the victims just bleed out of their mouths, for the blood is the only colorful thing coming out of their mouths.  And writers like Kevin Smith write their movie references and dialogue so well, with wit and insight, but Kevin Williamson thinks he can create laughs just by mentioning the name Freddy Krueger? Where's the wit in that?  And if they're going to parody and say references to killers such as Freddy, Jason, or Candyman, why isn't there a killer in this movie along those lines?  The killers in this movie are nothing but normal people with slight chemical imbalances, Whats the fun in that?"

So...that isn't very original. It is pretty much just the first movie's script rewritten (only dumber). When we learn the identities of the killers, we think ""Oh yeah"". But, they are both people who were underdeveloped. For one of the killers, we never really get to understand his motive, but hey. The other killer *POSSIBLE SPOILER* turns out to be one of those people who was secretly involved with the first movie. But, in this movie, we don't know about that until the very end. Which makes it just look like writer Kevin Williamson just made up that tie-in motive because he couldn't think of a better one. He too, obviously had no idea who he was going to make the killers out to be until he got to the part of the movie where the killers are supposed to be revealed. And that really isn't that good of a plan. Especially if you are writing a sequel. The main goal of a sequel is to surpass its predecessor. This sequel doesn't do that. Not in the least.

","Scream 2 is a more refined, even if less powerful movie in comparison with the first smashing one. It goes deeper into the debate about the importance of media communication, but obviously it is very far from the various films of the genre (i.e. Network). It is symbolic in most of its features, as strongly demonstrated by the real killer, who is, or seems to be a journalist. Craven and Williamson also underline how media, and not violent movies, can bring young generation to psychic disease. It is not a case that Gale Weathers renounces to her scoop for Linus (it is symbolic, not sentimental). Wonderful, of course the scene in the studios where, behind a glass, Gale meets Linus' hand. It a love declaration for cinema and everything that deals with it!"

","This is my second evaluation of the 'Scream' trilogy. To sum up the sequel: this is a movie that parodies itself and its predecessor. The characters in it do the things they were told exactly not to do in the first one. As well, a large part of the movie focuses in on whether a sequel can ever match the original. This one can't, but it is very creative. There is also the movie within a movie gimmick with 'Stab'. It mocks the horror genre with a cliched villain(a relative of one of the two original killers). Whether all of this is intentional or not(I lean towards it was), it makes for another good movie that knows it can't take itself too seriously."

In 20 years time people are going to be talking about how good it still is much like how the original Halloween, Friday The 13th and A Nighmare On Elm Street are still good.  Scream was very good that film, in Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson re-created the slasher ganre and in fine style but Scream 2 took the next step to the hall of fame of slasher movies.  The story line of the second one is so much better than the original it is not funny.  With Kevin Williamson now starting work on the 3rd Scream to finish his and Wes Craven's involved in creating the next great slasher movies.  Of course even though Wes and Kevin will not be involved in making a 4,5 or 6, I think we know that Mirmax will not stop at just 3 Scream's but Mirmax will have to go on and create 6 or 7 of them.  If the 3rd one is half as good as Scream 2 it will be a great film.  Everyone go and see Scream 2 Now."

"Erich-13","Null","0","0","8 October 2001"," Contrived, implausible
","In the sequel to ""Scream,"" screenwriter Kevin Williamson appears to have been so preoccupied with dropping clever film references and staging ""cool"" murder scenes that he forgot to add logic into the mix.  Rather than discuss all the implausibilities in the movie, I'll just use the first murder as an example.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>""Scream 2"" opens at a screening of ""Stab,"" the hugely successful movie based on the events of the first film.  Here's my first problem with the premise: While I can buy the idea of there being a movie-within-the-movie based on the supposed ""real-life"" murders of the first film, I cannot believe that it would be marketed with such gimmicks as glow-in-the-dark knives and costumes based on the killer's.  Would any studio market a film about Columbine by selling tie-in trenchcoats and toy guns?  At screenings of ""Summer of Sam,"" were audiences cheering at the re-creations of real-life murders? (Actually, considering the number of sick and/or tactless people out there, I probably shouldn't have asked that last question.)<br/><br/>The first victim (who, we later learn, was deliberately targeted and not chosen randomly) enters a men's room.  Both urinals are occupied, so he goes into an empty stall.  He hears some bizarre whispering in the next stall, and puts his ear to the divider to hear better.  Suddenly, the killer plunges a knife through the divider and into his head.<br/><br/>1. Since the killer was obviously already in the stall before the victim entered, how did the killer know his victim was coming into the restroom? (Keep in mind, the killer had this guy specifically targeted, and wasn't simply waiting for whoever happened to come into the stall.)<br/><br/>2. How did the killer know that both urinals would still be in use when the victim entered, forcing the victim into the stall?<br/><br/>3. How did the killer know somebody else wouldn't take the stall first?<br/><br/>4. Okay, I can accept the killer ""knowing"" that the victim would put his ear to the wall to listen in (human nature being what it is)...but how did he know the exact point on the wall where his victim's head was?  Why didn't the knife emerge, say, in front of the victim's face, or an inch above his head?<br/><br/>5. Since the killer seems to have counted on both urinals being occupied when the victim entered, how could he be sure that everyone else would leave while the victim was still in the stall?<br/><br/>And that's only the first murder...sadly, the rest of the movie is no more plausible."

","this movie is great but not quite as good as the other two scream movies in the trilogy but u should still see it because it is really very very good. MAJOR SPOILERS!! for the rest of this comments now i'm mainly writing this to explain some things that the ppl who didn't like this film said was bad or unrealistic. so here goes.<br/><br/>1. the killer mickey does seem realistic if u watch the movie again cause u will notice that he does carry a camera around ( most noticeable in the scene where u r once again introduced to gale weathers when she is listening to the police officers statement) and throughout the movie he is always pointing the finger at someone. but miss loomis i have to admit didn't have much of a clue but she too points the fingers at someone else such as the scene where she tells the other reporters that she thought it was supicious that sid's father was gone abroad again and u will notice that she and sidney never meet throughout the movie until the end. but i thought that having her as the killer was a very good twist and very surprising so i'm not complaining.<br/><br/>2.in the car scene the camera focuses in on the gun because the killer then takes it for the finale and that explains why they had a long shot looking at it. and of course sidney and her roommate hallie wouldn't have noticed it, i mean they just escaped and they were probably bloody scared that the killer was going to grab their legs as they escaped.<br/><br/>3. the horn sounded because her other hand was leaning on the horn when she was about to unmask the killer.<br/><br/>4. they couldn't smash the windows because it's a cop car and the back windows r a lot more reinforced that the others and they also didn't want to make too much sound in case it woke the killer.<br/><br/>5. in a who dunnit flick the killer always reveals himself to her main target, if he didn't then u would be pretty annoyed if u never knew who the killer was at the end of the movie and besides they thought that they were gonna kill sidney anyway so they weren't afraid to show her they're real identity.<br/><br/>6. back to the car scene, sidney does try to take off the mask of the killer, the 1st time she gets scared cause of the horn noise and the killer might have woken up and remember she is still leaning over him, and the 2nd time she goes back but he killer isn't there. there i'm done answering the questions of the STUPID ppl who just didn't understand  the film (no offence intended). now just a quicky on how much i luv this film. the cast were once again brilliant and the i think that there were more suspense scenes in the sequel such as the car scene and the soundproof rooms. i also loved the camera shots throughout the movie most notebally (i have no idea how to spell that sorry) the final camera shot which goes over the whole university at the end. overall very very good definately not a bad sequel but not as good as the first one because that was the origianal one and that's hard to top but scream 3 is the best of all of them. so watch this movie it definately deserves a higher mark that imdb users gave it just because they didn't understand it so GO WATCH NOW."
"Zophael979","Null","0","0","15 August 2001"," Inferior
","I loved the first film and I was jazzed when this one came out. When I saw it, I liked it but it just wasn't as good as the first. Many of the elements that made the first so good were absent and the Craven/Williamson connection just couldn't click twice...<br/><br/>STORY: It was okay, but kind of weak. In the first film, the revelation of the killers was a great twist. Here the murderers are two side characters that you never gave a damn about in the first place. The F13 reference was nice, but could've been far better done. Also, the movie is bogged down by rather pointless scenes, a somewhat slow pace, and a disappointing final confrontation. On the plus side, I liked how the characters progressed from the first film and it's nice that they didn't rethread the first movie's plot. I also really dig it when a main character is unexpectantly killed halfway through the movie.<br/><br/>ACTING: Neve Campell is good as usual, though I liked her better in the first film. Courtney Cox gets to expand her character beyond just being a bitch. I actually liked David Arrquette in this movie. So sue me. Jerry O'Conell bored the hell out of me. Timmy Olyphant was good, but more of him would've been nice. Jada Pinkett is annoying. Scary Movie was able to capitalize on that when it parodied this movie's openner. Jamie Kennedy works well as the comic relief. The chick from Roseanne is just as annoying as she ever was and was completely unconvincing...funny at times though. I also loved seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar in a cameo. Can't ya tell I'm a Buffy fan?<br/><br/>DIRECTING: Wes makes a suspenseful, bloody movie here. I think the final confrontation was too action oriented, but other than that...Wes helps save this movie.<br/><br/>MUSIC: Both the score and the soundtrack are inferior. Beltrami is solid, but his darker, grimmer soundtrack didn't come off well. Why did he have to reuse the crud from Broken Arrow? The soundtrack has some okay tunes, but is less satisfying than the original's.<br/><br/>OTHER: People bleed a lot more when they die in this one, but the first was more violent. Nothing special here except for that cop who ended up on the wrong side of the windshield. I'll say no more...Don't ask about tit shots. More politically correct stuff....Did anyone else think that Ghostface looked drunk in this movie? He had more grace in the first installment.<br/><br/>Overall we have a decent, but inferior sequel. Luckily Scream 3 made up for everything and ended the series on a higher note. Now let's home the series stays ended...we don't want Miramax pulling a Friday the 13th: A new beginning on us.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"

","!!!SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>Although Scream 2 has its flaws and may not be as entertaining as the original, I found it to be just as scary, funny, enjoyable, clever, and even as original as the first Scream.  The opening theater scene was just plain genius!  Great dialogue, GREAT casting (Jada and Omar make one terrific team!), and of course, horror!  It was very intense - I was VERY into it - and it was so clever how it was the complete opposite of Scream's opening scene (Casey was alone in a house, while Maureen and Phil were in a crowded theater/bathroom).  Although Casey's opening scene was scarier because you're more likely to get killed at home then in a crowded theatre, (and it was weird and far-fetched how no one noticed that poor Maureen was being stabbed to death) it was still just as clever and intense.<br/><br/>Once again, Kevin Williamson delivers a script with witty dialogue and well-developed characters.  It may not have as great a plot as Scream and Scream 3, but considering it's a sequel to a masterpiece, I'd say it's good enough.  And, of course, Wes Craven is able to produce extremely intense, suspenseful death scenes, complimented nicely by another one of Marco Beltrami's magnificent scores.  My favorite scene was the car crash. Completely terrifying!  It's great how just when Sid (Neve Campbell) and Hal (Elise Neal - pretty good actress) get out of the car and you can breathe a sigh of relief, Sidney decides to unmask the killer, and, unfortunately for Hallie, it backfires and the killer pops out again!<br/><br/>I have to admit that guessing who the killer was wasn't quite as fun as in the first, but the identity of one of them (Billy's mother - played well by Laurie Metcalf) was a great twist and made up for it.  Also, Mickey (Timothy something) was just as funny as Stu in the original.<br/><br/>I was heart-broken when Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and CiCi (Sarah Michelle Gellar) died (I'm a big fan of Buffy) but their performances were superb nonetheless.  Jerry O'Connell was even pretty good as Derek, Sid's new sane boyfriend (my sister always goes ga-ga over his cafeteria singing scene) and Liev Schrieber was great in his biggest role of the Scream movies; he made a good possible suspect.  Neve, David, and Courtney do great jobs as well reprising their roles.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to say that this is just as good as the original (after all, Scream is a masterpiece), but Randy was wrong: all sequels DON'T suck! I gave Scream 10/10, so Scream 2 gets a respectable 9/10."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ... as Stew said in the original Scream . This movie was a complete story by its own . But after the success of Scream the continuation chapters were inevitable . Although Scream 2 obviously does not compare with the first part it has some major improvements . The first is that the plot unfolds much more continuusly than the first. There is not an inch of dead time since the non action scenes are used for the dramatic development of the characters like the theater scenes . In Scream the parts where Sidney (Neve Campbell) was whining about her mother were kind of annoying . Also Jamie Kennedy was kind of irritating as Randy the last time . Here he is more mature and reliable without overacting and screaming . Also (thank God) there are less quotes from other movies just the necessary amount .<br/><br/>PLOT : 2 years after the gruesome murders in Woodsborow the events of Scream were made a movie called ""Stab"" based on the best seller book by the reporter Gail Weathers (Corteney Cox) . During the avant premiere a gory murder takes place in the most tragic way ( I won 't say more than this is better than the Drew Barrymore opening!!) Soon it becomes clear that a psychopath has decided to be the successor of the killer in Stab and has focused on the University campus where Sidney and Randy are now students . He is a copycat killer following precisely the same methods . The threatening phone calls , the black costume with the ghostface mask and the knife-using bloody slasher killings. Gail Weathers arrives on the scene to help the police and fulfil her own ambitions as well . The story is very good and the cast reunion is effective. The psychological horror is once again inherent : the maniac can be literally anyone . An obsessed movie fan who sadistically wants to poke his fun to Sidney by reviving her worst nightmares . It is very chilling since most of us have suppressed fears and subconciously always live in the sheer terror they might resurrect . Apart this psychological factor the writer made sure to give a motive almost to everyone . Even the most unconfessed motives are apparent . For example Dewey (David Arquette) and Randy are never exposed for their possible obscure motives but anyone with a common sense of logic can guess their motives for being the killers . Despite a few original scenes there are more chliches than the last time , unfortunately . E.g. Cicy is a supporting cast so you know she doesn 't stand a chance to live . The trapped in the car scene no matter how suspensful , it is contrived and very stupid . And finally the ending : the biggest flaw is that the killer 's motive is stupid or even better inexistant . There is a shocking revelation but it does not compensate for the bad taste the ending leaves us . It is not only disappointing but it is unrealistic and , even worse , not suspenseful. As soon as the killer is unmasked the agony freezes . In Scream that point was simply the beginning for the edge-of-your-seat climax .<br/><br/>I will have to warn you though that the fault is not the writer 's , at least totally . Kevin Williamson 's original draft is rumoured to be darker , had a different killer and better ending with a cliffhanger to be answered in #3 (it is obvious the obsession of Williamson with the Star Wars trilogy) . Probably the director or the producers changed it for PC reasons . Overall Scream 2 is a good sequel . It is worth seeing to keep up with the story . It has some good scenes but it is utterly destroyed by the ending . Bewarned . I haven 't seen Scream 3 but I hope it will restore the memory of the series .<br/><br/>SCREAM II          7.5 / 10"

And what did Sidney ever do to drive somebody on a killing spree?  If the killer is following Woodsboro, the killer must be from Woodsboro.  But who could it be?<br/><br/>Could it be one of Sidney's new friends?  They seem fine, but you never know.  One of them might be from Woodsboro.  Or maybe it's somebody in Woodsboro that she already knows.  A fellow survivor of the Woodsboro Murders?  Dwight `Dewey' Riley (David Arquette), Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), and Geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy).  Why would they want to kill her?  Dewey's sister died trying to help Sidney in the terrifying Woodsboro Muders, maybe Dewey blames Sidney for his sister's death.  Gale, maybe, we all know she's hungry for publicity, maybe killing is the only way to get some.  We all know Randy is in love with Sidney, maybe he thinks he can never get her, so he wants to kill her; Randy and Sidney both go to the same college, doesn't that seem a little strange; they went to the same high school, and now they go to the same college, hundreds of miles away from their hometown, Woodsboro?  Or even Cotton Weary (Liev Scheiber), the innocent man who was sent to death-row because Sidney falsely accused him of murdering her mother three years earlier, and now he want revenge?  The tale is just as terrifying as the original. This film is the best sequel I've ever seen.  It is just a good as the original.  No complaints.  Very scary, very funny, and very original just like `Scream'.  It's even very sad at one part is in the film, which also almost made me cry.  I won't give it away, but it has to do with Ghostface in the newsvan, (you'll know what I'm talking about after you saw this, or if you've already seen it).  You'll be touched by this shocking scene if you're a big fan of the original.  It's also got movie trivia, just like the first.  It's totally a movie for the horror buffs. I gave `Scream' 10/10, I decided it's fair to give `Scream 2' a 10/10, because it was just as good.  If you loved `Scream', I suggest you see this one too.  I would change nothing."

","this is a great movie. early on in the movie it takes a fun poke at itself in a film class talk about sequels being inferior, I think that Scream 2 is much better than the original Scream. So I gave it a solid 8/10. My only real complaint was the survival of the Gail Weathers character she just irritates me. So in a way that must make Courtney Cox a good actress. As for the rest of the movie the pace is well balanced with a good mix of suspence and a good twist as far as the second ghost was. It is also a good movie to see rising stars like Joshua Jackson and Rebecca Grayhart."

","[No spoilers]<br/><br/>I have to agree with the comment on the summary page for this movie - they introduced an entirely new character and never developed it, and then suddenly throw them in at the end as one of the killers.  It's one thing to make the killer the person you least suspected, but only when the viewer can think back through the movie and realise that it was them all along. Unfortunately in this movie, there were no clues at all to suggest it was them, except possibly when they were on the phone after the stabbing in the school AV room.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
As far as scary movies go, it was okay I guess, but the characters - were just so stupid sometimes.. I mean .. the car crash.. that was just ridiculous! - There were so many 'clues' in the film, yet they never came to anything. We see the killer smash in the window then cut the cop's throat, yet Sid and her friend are somehow unable to smash their own windows out, from the inside (she can't kick maybe ?), so they are forced to crawl over the unconscious body of the killer to get out. Then the other cop.. jeeze.. before they drive off, he stands up, with his gun, directly in front of the car, while the killer (who has already killed several people including the other cop, by this point, so there's no doubt that he'd have no problem killing the remaining cop) is in the driver's seat.. and instead of just shooting him, the cop waits until the killer is comfortable and ready to drive, then, stupidly, gets himself run over, and knocked onto the hood.<br/><br/>Okay, so that was stupid, but he's still there, and he's got his gun - so what does he do with it ? Nothing! He just hangs in there waving it at the killer, but doesn't actually fire it.. maybe he doesn't keep it loaded ?<br/><br/>And then... they have the crash, and we get a nice clear full screen shot of the guy dead with his head half through the windshield, and with his hand.... *still* holding his gun.  After Sid and her friend get out of the car (after climbing over the killer), they stand there, next to the car... next to the gun, and yet.. seem oblivious to its presence.<br/><br/>The killer has a knife.. a short distance weapon. Wouldn't a gun be handy right about now ?.. but no......   and I was left wondering why the hell they showed us the gun, and the easily smashed window, in the first place.<br/><br/>When you get a full screen closeup on something, it's *supposed* to show that there's something significant in the shot.. but not in this movie. You sure don't have to think to keep up with the plot.<br/><br/>There were lots of other scenes where things could have turned out a lot better if a few more intelligent choices had been made - when the killer was in the dorm, near the start of the movie.. and her cordless phone was cutting out... couldn't she just have gone and used a phone somewhere else ?.  Notice how nobody in the movie had a mobile ? .. and how her security system never went off despite her clearly turning it on, then having several people running through the house.<br/><br/>I think the script could have done things a lot better by shutting out the more obvious alternatives, and making the viewer really start to wonder about how they could get out of the current situation. As it stood, there weren't any really scarey scenes, because I never believed there was much of a threat - it was mostly a result of the characters doing something stupid, and then finding themselves in a pretty bad situation.<br/><br/>Having said all that, it wasn't that bad a movie for a horror film. It just wasn't terribly believable either.  I still enjoyed watching it, but they could definitely have done better, *especially* with the credibility of the killers when they are finally revealed at the end.<br/><br/>As a comparison, the movie 'The usual suspects' [ http://www.imdb.com/Title?0114814 ] did (brilliantly) exactly what I wanted to see more of in this movie - you don't suspect the real killer, but when they are finally revealed at the end, everything falls into place and you suddenly understand all the clues that didn't make much sense up until then.<br/><br/>Of course, I might be making too big a deal of this - it is only a horror film after all."
"Rinho18","8","0","0","30 January 2001"," My number 142 movie ( contains story + spoilers )
","Scream 2 is my number 142 movie. It is a good, but ridiculous, horror flick. I think that part 2 is the worst of the Scream-series, but nevertheless good. I can understand why someone dislikes this movie, because the characters sometimes act very stupid ( e.g. the car crash - if you have seen the film ). <br/><br/>The story : While watching Stab"" ( which deals with the incidents of Scream"" ) two people are killed. The police has not any suspicion, because everyone wears those Stab""-dress. The next day Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) is frightened because she gets a phone call by  the killer ( the killers ??? ). During the following days many people are killed by the murderer / murderers. In the end Sidney Prescott and the TV-correspondent Gale Weathers ( Courteney Cox ) meet the killer/s in the auditorium of the school. The final showdown begins....<br/><br/>I have to admit that I usually like all horror films, and this one is no exception. Although it is one of the more ridiculous ones, it is nevertheless scary. The actors are quite bad. It exaggerates in the end. If you try to keep yourself a secret from everybody ( by wearing a mask ) , you do not take your mass off voluntarily, do you ?!? But that is the same as in Scream 1 and Scream 3. <br/><br/>Question #1: Why did Sidney and her friend not take the mask of the guy in the car, who is unconsciously. <br/><br/>Question #2 : How is it possible to sound one´s horn if you try to take the mask of the guy ?<br/><br/>Question #3 : The killers kill everyone almost as fast as possible, right ? But why do they make a sensation with killing Sidney ? She is their main-victim, but they just do not want to kill her ? WHY ?????<br/><br/>This is definitely not one of the best horror movies. But it is a good one.<br/><br/>All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and recommend it to fans of horror films or to fans of the Scream-series ( of course ). I am pretty lucky that a film ( Scary Movie"" ) made fun of these horror movies. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them."

","What can I say - Scream 2 is probably the best film I've seen in my life.

Actually it's a very good movie. But not as good as the original. 2 years after the events in the first film, the terror starts again for Sidney. A killer copycats the murders from Woodsboro, exactly in the week of the premiere of Stab, movie made after the events in the first part.<br/><br/>Scream 2 does a very good job with the story and the action scenes: very well done and some of them very tensed. Still the phone-terror used in the first part is not that developed and scary. Except for this element, Wes keeps everything that goes well in the original. Including the very clever dialogue that worked so good in Scream.<br/><br/>After a surprising success (nobody expected Scream 2 to be a good movie, after the fabulous first part), Wes Craven should've stopped while he was on top. But he didn't. He chose more money in stead of being the undisputed God of horror films.

","I thought Scream was a masterpiece, so, naturally, I wanted to see Scream 2 and I expected it to be just as good. Although it was far from a masterpiece, Scream 2 is just as much fun as the first movie.<br/><br/>It's two yeas after the gruesome Woodsboro murders and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is enjoying a new life, a new boyfriend and new friends as a student at heavenly Windsor College. But that was before the opening night of 'Stab', the movie account of the horrific slayings at Woodsboro, based on the best-selling book written by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Now a 'copycat killer' is one the rampage and wants Sidney dead, again. As the body count rises the pressure becomes unbearable. No one is safe, and everyone is a suspect.<br/><br/>The great performers return from the first film - Neve Campbell is brilliant as Sidney, and Jamie Kennedy reprises his role as geek Randy perfect and David Arquette and Courteney Cox, who where rudely underused in the original, deserve credit for their more-developed characteristics. Wes Craven returns to the director's seat again, and he puts lots of effort into this killer sequel. Also, great writer Kevin Williamson reminds us how good sequel-scripts can get.<br/><br/>A must-see for fans of the original!<br/><br/>I rate Scream 2 8 out of 10."
"llihilloh","Null","0","0","9 December 2000"," The bads will outweigh the goods.
","Scream 2 is a must-see in order to survive a trilogy. Since a trilogy was thought of after the first one came out, obviously they had to come up with a sequel. If you want to follow the entire Scream story, than see this. If you would like to enjoy the first one as it is and not even bother with two more, than don't waste your time. <br/><br/>Scream 2 is almost as entertaining to watch as the first one. During the first ten minutes or so, two people are murdered. What will follow? Everybody's reaction is to think that there's going to be tons of different and exciting killing scenes to occur throughout the film. Wrong. I'm not one for watching detailed slaughter shots. They don't bother me and I won't deliberately turn away, but what's the point of having all of the characters die when there is not a strong reason to back it up.<br/><br/>The variety of stabbings will keep the slasher film fans content. However, it's pretty easy to predict who is going to die next. It comes to the point where whenever you see a new character introduced, your first thought is 'oh, they're going to die too.'<br/><br/>One of the problems with this film is that there are too many actors involved. The survivors from Scream return and are now working with Derek, Cotton, Mickey, Debbie, etc. Another problem is that a lot of the actors are given a part just so that their character can die, but serve absolutely no purpose to the plot. CiCi, Hallie, Phil, and Maureen will fall under this category. <br/><br/>~*spoiler~*<br/><br/>The writing is all right if you're not looking for anything too complicated. Scream revealed that Billy was the killer because Maureen was having an affair with his father. That story works out okay. Scream 3 pulled all the loose ends together and explained everything during the first two movies. This movie has nothing to go off of. When I found out that the killers were who they actually were, I was very disappointed. I can partly accept the fact that Billy's mother returns, but I cannot understand why Mickey was involve. Apparently they needed two killers in order to follow in the steps of the first film, but this just doesn't work. Mickey's character isn't even given that much exposure before it is revealed that he is one of the killers. Neither is Debbie's character. A few lines here and there to Gale, and that was it. If you're going to present a horror movie to us, than give us a good ending to wrap it up with.<br/><br/>The only thing more annoying than Neve Campbell still sitting high on the ""scream queen"" thrown, is the way that the killers were indestructible. Throughout the years, having killers that just won't die have become very popular and very unrealistic at the same time. The fact that we had to wait until the end to find out who they really were was one explanation as to why they couldn't die. My opinion is that the crew ruins a movie by doing everything necessary to kill off the murderers, but it is impossible for them to actually die until it is at the end and in a convenient situation.<br/><br/>
I'll say it again. This movie will please any Scream fan, but it wasn't a must to make. The story could have been left as a sequel with this one cut out, the third installment moved into the second place and the first one left as it was. A little confusing but I'm sure that with a few minor changes given to Scream 3, everything would have worked out okay."

I wonder if those who gave this toss that sort of review actually watched the film or if they just merrily gawked at the pretty-boys, until they got hacked to death?<br/><br/>After all, at least a good-quarter to half the film had them discussing about the fact that they're in a sequel? Doesn't this remind you of something right of Scooby Doo or some silly, childish cartoon of the sort, where some mouse, dog, or other potential pet w/ the powers of human speech, mentions something about a scene missing from the script? That's great for humor but definitely not for horror! To top it all off, they spend some minutes of the film watching a crude reenactment of the original, which results in not only the ridiculing of themselves but the unforgivable disrespect of their own audience. If they don't want to make a stupid sequel that bad then they should've set this one out, and let some other poor dope take the responsibility of releasing such junk.

Craven really loses himself here, as it is virtually cliche after cliche, jump-scare after jump-scare.

","For some reason, Scream 2 seems like a movie that was forced to be made just because of the huge success of the first's original formula, that is, to overtly reveal the cheap tricks of the horror movie.  It doesn't seem fresh, has a thin storyline, contrived characters, plays like a rehash, and concludes with an ending that seems patched on and is completely unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Scream 2 starts up with a fantastic shocker of a scene, where a murder takes place in a movie theater showing the film ""Stab,"" a spinoff of the events in Woodsboro in the first Scream film.  It's a terrific opening, as we see that Neve Campbell is now in college and is unnerved by the killing, suspecting it could be the 'sequel' she was warned about in the first installment.<br/><br/>While the movie may start with a fantastic, twisted scene, it's all downhill from there.  The survivors from Scream are back, and their familiarity helps bolster the sometimes slow, plodding scenes.  There's also much more gore here, but while Scream used it sporadically, Scream 2 certainly seems to rely on it to shock its viewers rather than the clever, manipulative scripting of the first.  The device of revealing the horror movie convention doesn't seem as fresh anymore; instead it seems like a cheap convention itself.<br/><br/>Not to say there aren't some scenes in Scream 2 that aren't wonderfully shot by Wes Craven, including a thrilling (if not too short) car chase, a frenzied search for a cell phone, and a poignant death.  But it's ending is much too farfetched and strikes the viewer much like the killer strikes with his knife: completely out of nowhere, without warning.<br/><br/>Scream is by far the superior of the trilogy, feeling much more inventive than this sequel.  When a film student in the movies remarks that ""the sequel destroyed the genre,"" you can't help but feel it's true at the end of this movie.  Fans of the first will be certainly be disappointed with this film's lackluster script and contrived ending.  <br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","Warning, may contain some spoilers.<br/><br/>The problem with most horror films now a days is that they are vacuous. There is a notion from a great many aspiring film makers that they can break into the business the same way that perhaps Carpenter and Moustapha Akkad did.  Carpenter, as we all know, made the legendary Halloween and Moustapha Akkad financed it for him.  That film broke all sorts of barriers and not only was it a good film, but it scared people.  In the early 90's, you had an apathetic audience without a modicum of desire to see horror films.  The genre had run its course with so many ersatz so called horror films, that no one gave any credit to even the good ones that were released.  But that all changed in 1996 when Wes Craven was smart enough to take a brilliant script by Kevin Williamson and turn it into something that all horror fans and movie fans could appreciate.  Scream became something of a legend.  This was a film that ostracized all of the banal efforts from the last decade and justified the horror film once again.  This was a film that respected the greats from the past like Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th.  It gave a rebirth to a stale genre and made it fresh.  I, for one was thrilled with Scream and even though there are now a slew of inferior horror films launched into mainstream, every once in a while you get films like Blair Witch, Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes and Final Destination.  These films make it easier to stomach all of the Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summers and so on.  Scream 2 carries on the story from Scream and it sets us up for the final installment.<br/><br/>Is Scream 2 any good?  Your damn right it is.  But it is not quite as good as Scream is.  But that is okay.  Halloween 2 was great but not as good as the first and the only Nightmare that was nearly as good as the first was the last one.  So as sequels go, this is a very fine one. <br/><br/>
Sydney is now attending college with her pal Randy.  She is hoping that all the fuss from her Woodsborough days are over but there is now a film being released that is based on the murders ( and in a great tongue in cheek moment, Tori Spelling plays Sid in the movie Stab ).  So there is now media attention once again hurled her way.  Then at a local screening of Stab, two of Sid's college cronies are murdered thus lending credibility to theory that it is starting all over again.  Soon Gale shows up and then Dewey. Gale shows her face for the media attention and Dewey is there to protect her.  So we now have all the major principals in place. <br/><br/>
Soon, people begin to die and we now have a full fledged psychopathic killer on the loose again with an ominous sounding voice.  <br/><br/>As Randy alludes to almost coyly, too coyly for it not to mean something, Scream 2 doesn't really solve anything.  Sure it is revealed that the killer happens to be Billy Loomis' mom and she has her own reasons for wanting Sid dead, but just as in Empire Strikes Back, there is always room for more story.  The ending of this film offered a conclusion, but there just seems to be something still lurking beneath the surface.  And this is where I have my theories. Bear with me here.<br/><br/>Randy says that Empire wasn't really a true sequel, that it was a planned part of a trilogy and that is obviously true of Scream.  Kevin Williamson may have started out with just a really neat idea about a horror film that parodies other horror films, but by the time he reached the second film, he knew there was enough material here to make three films, and in my mind, it will be four.  You see, I don't think the killer is really caught.  In Scream it was Stu and Billy, in this one it is Mrs. Loomis and in the third one it is, anyway, you get the picture.  But at the end of Scream 3, there is that feel to it that tells you that something further could happen.  Even at the end of Friday the 13th, the final chapter, Tommy's eyes are all bugged out and the producers were basically telling you that this was not the last installment.  And in Scream 2, I think there are real clues as to who the real killer is.  <br/><br/>When Randy is killed, we almost all but forget his conversation with Dewey about them both possibly being suspects.  Because with him gone, he is obviously not a suspect anymore, but why not Dewey?  Especially in this film, he is always around when the killings happen, and as he said about Derek when he was slashed on the wrist, he himself always just happens to get hurt but not fatally.  There are also shots of him in this film and in the first one wearing the same type of boots that the killer does.  To me, just like in Star Wars, there has to be a fourth one.  The script is all but jumping out at us and how many films have just stopped after making 4 films? Scream could make history by doing so.  There are just way to many possibilities and none of the doors have been shut on Dewey being the killer.  <br/><br/>Anyway, back to the film itself.  It does a nice job of furthering the story and Randy and his film class have some nice moments when they discuss movies and their sequels.  This film also does a nice job of famous cameos.  Joshua Jackson, Rebecca Gayhart, Portia DeRossi and Sara Michelle Gellar have small but fun roles in the film.  Actually the cast is well assembled in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Scream 2 is not quite as good as Scream but that would have been impossible anyway.  It is however, a good film and it does plenty to set up Scream 3.  This is a good second installment to the famous trilogy. <br/><br/>
8 out 10- Looking forward to the 4th one, if they can get the principals to come back...."

","You know what they say about sequels... they are never as good as the original. But that discussion is also in the movie, proving that some sequels are even better than the original movie, like The Godfather 2. I say Scream 2 is a great sequel but not better than the original. It's not worse either. There are 2 things I like the most about this movie:<br/><br/>1.) Gale Weathers. Courteney Cox has created an unique character which is very different from Friends' Monica and she is very good in both parts. Gale is very sassy and even bitchy at times but even tough she is all that you still hope she'll make it. She's definitely the character I enjoyed the most in all the Scream movies.<br/><br/>Sorry, but number 2 contains a HUGE spoiler, you shouldn't read on if you haven't seen the movie yet. You have been warned.<br/><br/>2.)The killers. Well, actually just Laurie Metcalf. I mean the other guy wasn't bad or anything,but he wasn't such a big surprise. But Laurie Metcalf? When the movie began and we met her character I thought, ""hey, that's Jackie, ""Rosanne's"" sister!"" Then I thought it was too bad her character in Scream 2 is very similar to Jackie. She seemed really typecast. Her character seems insecure, not self-confident and you first think the only reason she appears in this movie is that Gale Weathers has got an ideal victim for her smart one-liners. You think her purpose is to get some laughs. But in the end, you notice she is anything but ""Jackie"", she is one big psycho!!! Congratulations to the casting people and producers, that was a very clever move and I think very little people could tell she was the murderer. I loved this surprising ending!!!!"

And although the opening scene wasn't as good as the original's one, it was still excellent.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox and Jamie Kennedy return in this exciting horror/thriller/comedy, in which they are daunted by memories past of 2 young psychopaths out for revenge and ended up taking the lives of a big portion of their friends and family.<br/><br/>However, there's always flaws (especially when dealing with horrors) and I felt that although the killers were good, they had little or nothing to do with the storyline. But this didn't stop the writers from creating a kick-ass final scene - which far outweighs the first one - where, once again, Sydney and Gale (plus Cotton, this time) come face to face with their savage attackers.<br/><br/>Elise Neal, Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar are also welcolme delights, and Courteney Cox is still the caniving bitch with excellent one-liners that we've all come to know and love!!<br/><br/>I've seen this film, lot's more than either of the other two, because, in my opinion Scream 2 is, by far the better of the trilogy. 'Scream' got to become quite silly, and 'Scream 3' was very distant in terms of the fact it didn't really fit in with the whole storyline.<br/><br/>Anyway, 'Scream 2' is a wicked film. 9½/10!!"

","""Scream 2"" could have been a good horror film with its fairly good cast, but unfortunately, it violates an important law of horror movies:  the killer(s) and the slayings have to be distinctive, interesting, and inspire terror from the audience!  If killing is the business of the killer(s) in ""Scream 2,"" then somebody had better file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Except for toying with Sarah Michelle Gellar over the phone a little, the killer(s) in this movie just stabs and runs.  How terrifying...Ironically, when ""Scream 2"" has an in-class discussion about sequels being inferior films, it ends up referring to itself.  The Friday the 13th series often get maligned as mindless slasher films, but at least Jason killed some of his victims in unusual ways, such as swinging one of them against a tree like an axe or smashing & electrocuting another one by smashing a TV set on his head.  If the killer(s) of ""Scream 2"" would employ methods of murder like those, then it could be deemed as a worthy sequel to the original."

Even the look of the film was stronger than the other two.<br/><br/>Frankly, bashing this film and praising the third is enough to make me recommend watching them again.  The third was a watered down, boring, insainly silly, would-be character piece that was a forced and pathetic attempt to link the trilogy together.  Suddendly characters had no backstory.  They said lines to push the story forward.  There was even a lack of Close Ups.  It showed that Craven's interest in the series was wanning.   If the weakness in Scream two is the ending... the weakness in two is everything after it's intense opening.<br/><br/>Re: Scream 2, if removing a certain character was too much for you to handle, then that's too bad.  It's called good drama.  I couldn't believe that they did it.  I felt angry, I felt upset... then I realized, exactly how powerful and effective the scene was.<br/><br/>On the downside, the last 15 minutes are rather... inept.

Some of the characters appear paper-thin- a pitfall Scream had successfully dodged.  Lastly, the ending seemed to fall flat: cheesy, unrealistic, and thrill-less.

","What'd I expect? I mean, Scream was absolutely outstanding. It combined suspense, fun and originality in a never-before-seen way. To come up with a sequel that is better than Scream is a mission: impossible. I was aware and prepared that Scream 2 wouldn't beat the original. But still I was fairly disappointed. Scream 2 had almost none of the cleverness and wit that made its predecessor so originally entertaining. In addition, it changed the characteristics of some of the persons from the first one which was very confusing.<br/><br/>The story was basically a repetition of the first Scream (which isn't that tragic) but with less twists and surprises in it. In Scream we had the time to get to know all the important characters including the killers but it still wasn't easy to guess the killer right. In the end there was this unique experience: ""Oh, of course it was them, why didn't I realize this earlier?!"". When I watched the film again I had to admit that everything perfectly fit. Scream 2 totally failed in this point. The reason why it was almost impossible to figure out who the killers were, is that they had nearly no screentime until the very end. It could as well have been Norman Bates or Santa Claus. It is very easy to hide the killers by not showing them at all.<br/><br/>But nonetheless, Scream 2 had some pretty cool scenes. The opening scene in the movie-theatre at a sneak preview of ""Stab"" (a movie based on the events at Woodsboro in Scream) was excellent. Like in the original Scream it was very cruel, sadistic and maybe even more inventive. It didn't have the same impact one me though. This scene left me hoping for more. Another exciting scene includes Randy, Dewey and Gale Weathers standing on the lawn of the college. They get a call from the killer who is able to see them. They run around trying to find him/her even attacking some students. But then, in my opinion, Williamson made a big mistake by killing Randy. His death in the very same scene deeply disturbed me. Not because it was too cruel or anything like that. There was just something wrong with it, I thought he was the wrong person to get killed and that he should be among the survivors. They'd rather have killed Sidney Prescott, that would have surprised everybody and made this series unique! (Remember Randy: ""I'd let the geek kill the girl."")<br/><br/>One more good scene that comes to my mind was the one in the sound studio which was very thrilling. Dewey is trying to call Gale through the soundproof pane when the killer is attacking him from behind. That was very clever. But again I have a small complaint: What does it need to kill Dewey? A nuclear bomb? Normally the lunatics are the ones that are (almost) immortal but no matter how much he gets stabbed, he doesn't die!<br/><br/>There are some very illogical scenes too, for instance when Sidney first runs away from the car, then decides to go back to see who the killer is. And the two agents that are supposed to protect Sidney: Were they on the drugs? My grandmother moves faster than these two did, and believe me, my grandmother is not that young anymore!<br/><br/>The irony that made Scream so amusing is reduced to a minimum in this sequel. The discussion about sequels was nice to watch but other than that...almost nothing. Why did they eliminate one of the most important elements? Instead we see all sorts of persons having all sorts of psychological problems. Sidney is still suffering from what happened to her at Woodsboro. Her boyfriend is not that happy either because his relationship to Sidney is starting to fall apart. Dewey has become a complete ghost. That kind of naive touch that he used to have made him the most enjoyable person in the first film. And Gale Weathers now feels alone and abandoned (*sniff*). Even the dead people are not happy. It seems as if all the persons have been replaced by emotionless robots. Especially Dewey has lost all his charm. The whole film is more like a psychological drama than a teen-horror slasher and that is not what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>If Craven had deleted some scenes, the movie wouldn't be that boring either. Some elements are weird, some are boring and others are weird and boring at the same time. Sidney belongs to a theatre group. I guess it was supposed to make Sidney look more like a real person but in fact it just slows down the film. And I didn't quite understand the point of Sidney's boyfriend being ""abducted"" by some freaked teens. I think it was only used to explain why he appeared in the final scene.<br/><br/>Let's face it: Stu and Billy were not that agile. But in Scream 2 the killer simply runs into every single obstacle. I wasn't quite sure if he wasn't even blind. I found myself laughing at him several times, especially when he followed Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and stumbled over the couch etc..<br/><br/>But despite of all these flaws mentioned above the film still could have been far above average. But they decided to shoot one of the most pointless and boring endings in movie history. Mickey was quite a good psycho but Debbie Salt aka the mother of Billy was about as frightening as a banana. Laurie Metcalf tried to pull off some kind of Mrs. Voorhees-thing but she is so implausible that it gets ridiculous. Scream 2 turned out to be one of the only films in horror history to end with a shoot-out, not very scary either...<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Scream 2 is still one of the best films in this newly discovered genre (teen slasher). It's just way worse than the original. It is illogical and boring at places. But overall it is still enjoyable and provides decent entertainment (except for the ending).<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10"

Most of the time went to figure out who the killer was, and that was incredibly fun to speculate about.<br/><br/>                              The story is about the same as before. A new killer is stalking new victims, well awere of the rules of sequels. Here we have some new butcher-victims to ''slice and dice'' and Craven really follows those sequel-rules. The biggest different between S2 and its original is the amount of blood. This is what you can call a ''blood-show'' where the victims are lined up to get knives stucked up here and there. In the first movie I figured out pretty soon who the killers were (or it was at least my theory all the way out), but here it was so many people to choose from and that made it fun! It is ''Cluedo'' all the way, but when the killer (or killers, maybe killress) got revealed it was a slightly bad pick. Otherwise ''Scream 2'' hits bullseye and for you who liked the first screammovie will NOT be dissapointed on the sequel.<br/><br/>                              8/10"

This film was definately scarier and more jumpy than the first film perhaps because I saw this in the cinema and saw the original on video.  However I still reckon the first one was better.  Having said that this was very well made and had some excellent death scenes plus some great in-jokes so chances are if you like the first one you will like this."

The original just kind of went along without much of a story, but the killer(s) in this movie actually had a real motive.

If you were a fan of the first movie, and even if you were not, I recommend renting it.

","After an enjoyable experience of watching ""Scream"", I decided to rent the sequel, so I could say ""yeah, I've seen em' all"".  I liked it in some ways, because of it's more humorous attitude towards the subject matter.  I liked the idea of the incidents in the first ""Scream"" movie becoming a box-office smash called ""Stab"", where souvenirs and costumes of the killer are bestsellers.  It was funny, original, and poked fun at sensationalism. However, ""Scream 2"" was not much different from the first one, and it was not nearly as scary.  There was a sort of ""seen that, been there"" taint and some scenes were scary, like the one where Sidney climbs out of the car over the killer, while still others wasted time.  There were also moments when it got a little weird, like the scene where Sidney's new boyfriend is carried away by crazed kids who tie him to a prop used for a play, strip him, and pour beer on him.  That left me scratching my head.  The biggest flaw though is the revelation of the killer.  I couldn't help but go ""Aw, c'mon!"" when the killer's, or killers' identity was revealed.  I am still curious about the 3rd ""Scream"", and just because I didn't like ""Scream 2"" as much as it's predecessor doesn't mean that I didn't have as much, if not more fun watching it.  One last thing though.  How does that one guy Dewey keep surviving no matter how hacked and maimed he gets by the killer?"

","Oh goodness.  Let's review what I consider to be the top five continuity problems / unlikely occurrences from Scream 2.<br/><br/>5.  Cici's fall from the balcony is inconsistent with the way she is thrown.<br/><br/>4.  Sidney and Halle switch places in the car.<br/><br/>3.  Seven major characters just happen to find themselves in the same place for the film's climax (Sidney, Gail, Dewey, Debbie Salt, Mickey, Cotton, and Derek).<br/><br/>2.  While the climax definitely takes place at night, the very end of the movie, which we are made to believe occurs right after the climax, appears to be happening at noon.<br/><br/>1.  The killer is apparently clairvoyant and/or psychic.<br/><br/>And yet I like the movie (and the other two - which are also flawed in such ways) anyway.  In truth, I let the Scream movies get away with more than any other series of movies out there.  This is partly because all three have their share of clever moments, but I think it's also because I'm not sure how many of the problems are intentional.  They're good movies almost in spite of themselves.  8/10."
"Chris-332","8","0","0","5 February 2000"," Funfilled and clever, but a couple mistakes.
","When I first saw Scream 2 I thought that it was way better than the first one. Then when I saw it a couple more times, I noticed the problems of the movie. Although the script is as fresh with its characters and dialogue, some scenes in the movie are very predictable. It wasn't scary at all. The main killer at the end was stupid, I admit that. I loved the first killer that you found out about, as well as his/her motive. But then the movie introduced the partner, who turned out to be the main killer. It was really stupid. They cast the wrong person for it, and it just didn't work in many respects.<br/><br/>Now, with the problems out of the way, I can tell you about the good things about the movie. I absolutely loved the whole idea of Stab in this movie. It created something totally different in the new movie world. For those of you who have not seen the movie, Stab is a movie-within a-movie based on the events in the first Scream. Tori Spelling plays Sidney, David Schwimmer plays Dewey, etc... It was very clever. It was also just as funny as the first one, and I was roaring with laughter during the scene when Dewey sees Gale and has a little talk about her book. Jamie Kennedy was in the spotlight for most of the film, and he did just as good a performance as Randy as he did in the first one. The whole cast of new people fit the Scream team very well, especially Jerry O'Connell, Sid's new boyfriend away at college.<br/><br/>So, all in all, the movie was very good despite its weak ending and its sometimes predictable storyline. I used to think it was the best Scream, but the more I think about it, the more it's the worst one. It still is very good, though, and is a worthwhile and worthy follow-up to the greatest horror movie of the 1990's."

","""Scream"" was great.  It was very good and broke away from all the mediocre horror sequal that were the only exposure to the not-quite-as-serious genre of Horror to a new breed of teenagers.  ""Scream 2"" was exactly what was right about the first, but exelled in a completely different direction. *Spoiler* While I admit that the killers were strongly underdeveloped and just did not work very well.  Fortunately, Laurie Metcalf is such a skilled comedical actress that she was able to pull off a scene that Timothy Olyphant destroyed, although you can hardly blame Timothy for his lack of scenes.  Other than that, the movie was perfect.  Every scene was full of action, and each scene became increasingly better as the movie moved on. The movie did not seem at any time too long.  After seeing the movie for the first time, I loved it.  I was not at all disappointed.  I was only worried that the new would wear off of ""Scream 2"" and upon second viewing it would not live up to its first viewing.  It never did.  What I loved best about the movie was Gale's extended role, which fills in what Sidney's role takes away.  I thought the killing off of an original character was a brilliant move, and really shocked me upon first viewing.  What more, they made sure to do it near the begining of the movie, so that for the rest of the movie your were left to wonder: if they'd kill one original character, would the kill another?  I thought this wonder was most evident during the scene in which Gale is trapped in the sound room, when any movie-goer was wondering if she would survive.  I, also, loved the scene when Sidney was trapped in the police car.  Several people have deconstructed the movie way too much. It was definately more entertaining than the first.  Isn't that what movies are for: entertainment?"

There's a new killer or killers out there, knocking off sophisticated-talking teen bye sophisticated-talking teen. There's more shocks in this entry, including Randy's death sequence and a sequence where a pipe goes right threw a cop's head. With scenes like these, I place it over it's original. But, we're use to non-sophisticated-talking teens in horror films, and I like those classics better. They were the standard slasher films."
"svswinger-2","9","0","0","6 January 2000"," Upon further review.......
","The first time I saw this movie, opening night, I couldn't have been more disappointed. After the opening scene, which was great, I thought Scream 2 spiraled downward and every scene was worst then the one before it, finally wrapping up with the worst ending ever seen on film. I hated this movie. That is, until I was able to see it again on video. Sometimes it takes a second viewing on video to really concentrate and pay attention to all the little details to really appreciate a movie. This is one of those movies.<br/><br/>   While I still believe the ending was terrible, I thought the rest of the movie gets better every time I watch it. The opening scene is fantastic, and (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) I loved the idea of the killer sitting in the movie theater amongst hundreds of look-alike killers, with nobody knowing who the killer is or if he's even there. As Jada Pinkett finds out in a very clever scene, he is there.<br/><br/>   I thought the best scene in the movie occurs when Randy, Dewey, and Gail are standing in the grass courtyard at the college, and the killer calls them on Gail's cell phone, playing games and watching them from a distance. I love the camerawork used while following Randy around as he searches for the killer. One shot in particular has the camera looking down on him from the sky, nobody else visible in the whole shot, which gives a feeling of me against the world, which Randy must have been feeling. The whole scene is great.<br/><br/>   Is Scream 2 better than the original? No, but you can't compare a sequel to its original, because it will never compare (as they discuss within the movie.) ""Sequels by definition alone are inferior films"" Scream was one of the few horror movies I could truly call great, and Scream 2 is likewise one of those rare sequels that at least approach the quality of the original (such as with Lethal Weapon 3 & 4 and Die Hard With a Vengeance).<br/><br/>
   Now for the ending. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) They hinted throughout the movie as to the killers identity ""Mrs. Voohries was a terrific killer"" But I never thought they would cop out and go for the simple answer of ""Billy's mother?"" She was terrible as the killer, and did nothing but annoy me the entire movie. Mickey at least was interesting, but his character was barely even developed and then, all of the sudden, here he is, your serial killer. I thought for sure going in that Stu somehow survived the first Scream and was coming back for part two, and when they introduced Debbie Salt as the killer, my heart took a dive. The ending was pathetic, and I still hold out hope of a decent killer in part 3 (maybe Stu), but I still give it a 9 out of 10, with the ending keeping it from a 10."

Most of the time went to figure out who the killer was, and that was incredibly fun to speculate about.<br/><br/>The story is about the same as before. A new killer is stalking new victims, well awere of the rules of sequels. Here we have some new butcher-victims to ''slice and dice'' and Craven really follows those sequel-rules. The biggest different between S2 and its original is the amount of blood. This is what you can call a ''blood-show'' where the victims are lined up to get knives stucked up here and there. In the first movie I figured out pretty soon who the killers were (or it was at least my theory all the way out), but here it was so many people to choose from and that made it fun! It is ''Cluedo'' all the way, but when the killer (or killers, maybe killress) got revealed it was a slightly bad pick.

This is by far THE best horror sequel of all time.  Much more solid than ever before, the horror genre reached it's peak with this film's release.  Someone here wrote that the killers were not significant to the story....  Hum, did you even WATCH the movie, or did you just scan through it?  The killers here were even more relevant than in the first one. Granted, it couldn't have happened without the first one, but darn...  Also someone wrote that there is one death every five minutes.  Were you drunk when you watched the movie?  After the first ten minutes, there's not a death scene in over an hour.  I loved the first one, and to try to top it was a little too much to ask for.  But this movie gave one heck of a fight to try to do it, and I personally think it did in fact top it.  The person who wrote that Wes Craven never has likable characters...  You need to get those arrows out of your ass.  Johnny Depp and Heather Langenkamp from ""Nightmare on Elm Street""?  Julie in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare""?  Angela Bassett in ""Vampire in Brooklyn""?  And ALL the characters in ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2""?  Even the bitchy ones were rendered entertaining.  I was left literally with my mouth wide open while reading your comments.  You trash brilliant movies like this, and praise such idiotic, trashy and terrible films like ""The Waterboy"", ""Big Daddy"" and other complete and utter s***. I can't wait for ""Scr3am"", because they say it's more mature than the two others, which is just what this series needs; one more excellent entry to make this the best horror series in history.  Praise Wes Craven, Kevin Williamson, Neve Campbell, and everybody else attached to either films."
"Ari-21","9","0","0","8 October 1999"," The Best Horror Movie I've Seen
","`The Craven for Terror' Scream2: rated R, 2 hours and 2 minutes<br/><br/>As stated in the movie by actor Timothy Olyphant (Mickey), `History repeats itself.' Scream1 and 2 each have certain elements and scenes that are rest assured not coincidentally almost exactly alike. For instance, Dewey, Gale, and Sydney are your typical Scream heroes, (or at least it looks as though they are). A question asked during both movies is `Did the boyfriend do it?' You've got to be a certified genius to figure out who the killer is in this murder mystery, because in short, everyone's a suspect!<br/><br/>The sensational teenage cast plays a big role in bringing Scream2 to its full potential. Jada Pinkett, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jerry O' Connell, Liev Schreiber, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Tori Spelling, and of course, Neve Campbell are what make up this phenomenal cast of Gen. X's. The scenes are gripping as each one takes you on a trip through terror lane, using each important character as your tour guide for the intense adventure.<br/><br/>Though the movie is exceedingly interesting, it is obviously not the most realistic movie. Everything revolves around killings, and key word, possible killings. Even so, Scream2 isn't so far from reality (okay, it is, but Craven did his best anyway); the outrageous parts were done to look as believable as possible.<br/><br/>As many more people were killed in the sequel than were in the previous movie, (remember, all second flicks have twice the mayhem), which has proved that the more murdered, the merrier. Characters were literally torn apart, and the audiences liked it, despite how gruesome it may sound, it definitely caught their attention, and it certainly caught mine!<br/><br/>Scream2, directed by Wes Craven, also starring Elise Neal, has earned it's A in the ever lasting genre of horror movies."

","Scream 2 was flawed from the beginning. The release of this film so close to it's original was warning enough that this film would not be as good. The movie process can be a quick one but the process of making a GOOD movie is a little longer. With that said though Scream 2 is still pretty darn good.<br/><br/>With the release of Stab, a film depicting the events of Woodsboro, copycat murders soon begin and so does a media invasion on the university that valiant Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is attending. The usual run from the killer scenes are there as is the who dunnit mystery of the original but has varying degrees of success with both. Scream 2 isn't as scary as it's predecesor instead replacing the horror with bitchy banter between Sidney and Gale Weathers (Cox in her returning role) and never ending pop culture references which do get tiresome with no suspence until at least 3/4 of the way through the movie (besides the opening scene).<br/><br/>The cast isn't up to the caliber of the original either with the returning characters simply going through the motions. Neve seems bored, Kennedy's oddly reserved as Randy and David Arquette is back sporting a limp which he concentrates on more than his acting. Cox on the other hand is sensational. She's twice as bitchy and even colder second time round. As for the new recruits. They are as bland as the returning ones with a few exceptions. Pinkett betters Drew Barrymore's infamous opening scene, with her pro black attitude at the premiere of the white dominated film, Stab. Olyphant is also good as the ""freaky Tarantino film student"" as is Laurie Metcalf as a rival reporter. <br/><br/>This film has high expectations to live up to and while it's a great film in it's own right, as a Scream sequel, it doesn't even rank.

","Warning: Plot Details in this Review!<br/><br/>Scream 2 was excellent!  With the return of writer Kevin Williamson, director Wes Craven, and cast members Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Liev Schrieber, you could not go wrong with this movie.  And, with the additions of the likes of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jerry O'Connell, and Jada Pinkett, what's not to love, huh?  What's not to love?<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie takes place after the murders of Woodsboro.  The killers, Billy and Stu, were brought to justice after killing several people in the small town.  Now, Sidney and the surviving and additional kids have gone off to college, hoping for a new start.  However, that dream quickly fades away after two of her college classmates are murdered in a movie theater (Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps).  After that, the new killers attack Billy and Stu's former targets in hope for redemption.<br/><br/>I thought this was an excellent movie.  In Scream 3, I have heard that Wes Craven has come back once again (yes!) to direct the final chapter in the trilogy, but Kevin Williamson is not on full duty for writing the script. For this, I should be very disappointed, but the writer taking his place is Ehren Kruger, who also wrote Arlington Road, a very very good movie.  So I don't know how this will turn out, but my expectations are very high.  Go see all of them.  My grade: A"

","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS READ ONLY IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE<br/><br/>Anyway now that that's out. Here's the review. OK first scene very scary. Jada Pinkett (now Smith)'s death was very spooky indeed. Then Randy's death, not only scary but funny (the guys with the stereo) I LOVED Cici's (Sarah Michelle Gellar, aka Buffy) death totaly spooky. Then the part with Duey and Gale in the projecting room gave thrills as well. It was a prettt good movie, more laughs, less thrills. I was very disapointed with the ending though, the killers were such minor characters we new nothing about so we didn't really care and the last scene in Scream defunetly beat this scene. Also the first scene beat Scream 2's first scene (That's probably one of the scariest scene's I've ever seen up til today). DON'T see it if you didn't see the first, you won't understand it, it brings up a lot of things mentioned in the first (doesn't really continue the story but continue's the minor stories of scream, the personal lives, not the murders) So if you haven't seen the first you won't get this film.

"Adec","8","0","0","16 August 1999"," A solid sequel...
","I really enjoyed the first Scream film, in fact I'd go so far as to rate it as a modern horror classic, so I was hoping that this film would be all that it's forerunner was, and would be another thrilling, knowing, well structured horror chiller...and for the most part it achieves this, although that said it definitely lacks some of the originality and class of the original.<br/><br/>Scream 2 has it's share of tense scenes and well paced scares, and is again helmed with edgy style by Wes Craven, but similar to a discussion by actors David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy in the film, it fails to be bigger, badder and scarier than the first film, despite it's best efforts to deliver to the contrary.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's just a case of the original working so well that this fails to match up in comparison, as it's still definitely one of the best chillers to come out in quite some time, (and far superior to most modern efforts) and it does have a good twist ending that works well...although it must be said it isn't as convincing as the original films twist was, but there's just something about Scream 2 that feels slightly by the numbers.<br/><br/>
Then again maybe it's down to the fact that this film was made so soon after the original, or that almost no matter what this film tries it can't match the freshness and originality that the first one had going for it. Or maybe it's the fact that the first film basically came out of nowhere to impress while this one has a stylish parentage to live up to that brings about the feeling that it isn't as satisfying as it should be, but whatever it is that feeling of ""almost, but not quite"" definitely comes into play.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part is well done, with Neve Campbell once again providing a very solid lead, ably supported by the likes of returning players Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber and new faces Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Elise Neal and Heather Graham all fun in their various roles. However it's not all acting joy as Jerry O'Connell and David Arquette both seem to sleep through their roles, while Laurie Metcalf goes a little too far over the top in her role to be totally convincing. But even so there aren't any real embarrassments performance wise here to speak of, and for the most part everyone works quite well in their respective roles.<br/><br/>As mentioned above Wes Craven does another very classy job of directing here, and while at times Kevin Williamson's script seems to be trying a little too hard, for the most part it's well written and paced, as is the film that it's based on.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being too critical, as the film based on it's own merits is still a darn good watch, but I just couldn't shake that ever so slight feeling of disappointment. Still that said Scream 2 is a very enjoyable horror film, and just so long as you don't go in expecting it to be all the original was you should have a pretty good time here.<br/><br/>One man's opinion. 8/10"
"roland-27","Null","0","0","15 August 1999"," Hmmm....
","The biggest mistake that Kevin Williamson ever made was to get rid of the characters that made Scream so brilliant. Neither Stu(Matt Lillard), Billy(Skeet Ulrich) nor Tatty(Rose McGowan) are in Scream 2.<br/><br/> Sidney(Neve Campbell) and Gale(Courteney Cox) are tiresome and uninteresting. The newcomers-Timothy Olyphant, Duane Martin, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jade Pickett, Omar Epps, Rebecca Gayheart, Jerry O Connell, Elise Neal and Josh Jackson are only slightly better.<br/><br/> So we're left with Randy(Jamie Kennedy), Dwight(Dave Arquette) and Cotton(Liev Scrieber) to light up the screen with flashes of genius and quick wit. Which thankfully, they do...<br/><br/> The coffee house scene where Randy and Dwight try to narrow down the possible suspects is incredibly good and the scene where Randy plays the killer at his own game with a mobile phone is executed well by Kennedy and directed brilliantly by Wes Craven. The end scene where the killer/s expose themselves to sidney is done well(except the killer/s themselves don't have very big parts).<br/><br/> In summary, Scream 2 could have been superb(like the original) but for lack of interesting characters, it is not. Saved only by 'The Boys' Kennedy, Schreiber and Arquette. Rating=3/5.<br/><br/> P.S.It could just be my eyes playing tricks on me but does Rose McGowan appear in the pictures at the start?

","Scream 2 is truly an interesting slasher flick which effectively creates sympathy for it's characters. The characters in this movie are not only smart, but they actually care for each other.  There are problems though. The movie seems to loose track of where and how the killer gets where he is. They put them in most places at once or gives them very little time to get there from where they were earlier. And how does the killer get everyone's phone number? And how does he jam a door so no one else can escape yet he escapes when he needs to? I was kinda hoping  this movie would answer some of these questions. But I like how they give the killer personality. HE's not dull but scarier than most killers and more interesting than Michael Myers in halloween: H20."

","First of all, ""Scream"" is a horror film that can`t possibly be outshined when it comes to slasher flicks, at least not by any made in this decade. It`s the movie that made a breakthrough in the horror genre in the 90`s, and it`s just a shame that churned out so many mediocre clones, including it`s own sequel. I didn`t really have high expectations for ""Scream 2"", I estimated that it would be a reasonbly good follow-up, but nothing special. After I viewed it, I was quite disappointed. ""Scream 2"" lacks a lot of the first ""Scream""`s virtues, including cleverness and suspense, and even though there were some traces of those qualities,( with the exception of irony, which was quite well done) it felt like they were just recycled from before. Don`t get me wrong, there a few moments that are scary, but it`s shock value doesn`t do much for the overall movie. The reunion between some of the principal characters were cheesy, and they got old very fast. None of them seemed to have the same zest as they did in the first one, not even the most eccentric ones. Also, a lot of the death scenes were very unbelievable, people get butchered in broad daylight and on public streets and still nobody seems to be around to notice.  But the worst part about ""Scream 2"" was probably its climax, suspense was completely absent, and some parts of it were quite humourous instead of frightening. When the killers expose themselves, the movie already starts to wane, probaly because nobody knows anything about them, and frankly, no one cares either. The resolution is sketchy, and conveniently almost all of the survivors of the first ""Scream"" live on. In simple words, ""Scream 2"" has its moments, but it`s not a worthy sequel."

If you have seen both movies you will know who I'm talking about.  Why not kill Sydney? Nobody likes her.  It is almost like the director is trying to make the movie suck even more.<br/><br/>If you like Teen Slasher films, you will probably like this movie.  Scream 3 is one the way, although I probably won't see it, due to the fact that Deputy Dewey is the only likable character left.

The main characters are strong ( Sidney and Gale ) though I have less emotion for Sidney. Gale has taken on new heights and is still fully enjoyable. Though many were angered at one character's untimely death, fans and those who weren't previously, can still find themselves having an extreme good time. Besides, with cameos by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Wes Craven, and Matthew Lilliard, who could possibly hate this movie.

","Although not as sharp as the first one, Scream 2 had its moments. Courteney Cox and David Arquette were the two actors that really stood out this time round whereas Neve Campbell as Sidney was again irritating as she was in the first - no offence to the Neve fans.<br/><br/>I won't mention the killers names but the main one was so obvious that I picked it the first time I saw this particular person on screen - the second killer I had a little difficulty picking and I thought this person's motive was weak.<br/><br/>The third Scream movie, hopefully, will be the prequel/sequel scenario so lets hoping some of the characters from the first movie ( mainly Drew, Skeet, Matthew and Rose - who were sorely missed in the second one) will all make return appearances.<br/><br/>Even though Scream 2 wasn't as good as the first I still recommend it because as sequels go  - this wasn't all that bad - did anyone see I Still Know ???."

","Scream was a classic movie with young stars that are all on the way up. Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Neve Cambell, Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy. But Scream 2 even if it doesn't have as many rising stars as the original it still is better. Liev Scrhiber gave a stand out peformance as Cotton Weary while Jamie Kennedy once again stole the show as Randy Meeks. The killer(s) were not as important characters in this movie as the killer(s) were in Scream. I think that was beacause in Scream everybody from Stu to Tatum to Sheriff Burke was a big part of the film and it would of been a shocker no matter who they picked as Ghostface. But in Scream 2 they focused on Randy, Derrick, Cotton, Dewey, And Gale and not others like Mickey, Hallie, Debbie Salt, and Chief Hardly."

You call this a horror movie ? The only horror about it is the fact that it's horrible . And that flicks like this spawn their copycats , just the way they were spawned themselves- right out of the monotonous , teenager - slashing stupidity of "" Friday the 13th "" , "" Texas chainsaw massacre "" and the like . Pardon me for blaspheming , I know these are true classics to many , but , let's face it , folks - what's frightening about a movie where there are no surprises to speak of , no originality , no real suspense , just one stereotype after another ? WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE , MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO . It was fresher then .Now , it's like a fish slowly rotting away on a fish market one week after it's been pulled out of the water . Wow , how yummy .Wes Craven is a true genius - he found out a way to make big bucks by selling something that's been sold more times than Viagra .<br/><br/>The story is ridiculous , the conclusion barely makes sense , and that first scene in the theater- boy , what a farce ! A girl , fatally stabbed with a knife through a dashboard ( these serial killers must be doing a lot of workout ) crawls out of the lavatory bleeding like a pig , stumbles through the crowded theater just to scream her last scream right in front of the movie screen and then drop dead - instead of searching for help ?It's a straightforward comedy , no need for a parody - because that's what the whole movie already is . Someone's killing teenagers ? Really ? Oh ,no ! He stalks them , calls them on the phone using a voice modulator , mask and a big knife ? How original , how new , never seen before ! All the teenagers are pretty and sexy ? Well , another surprise , in other slashers they usually look like Quasimodos .<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned , this is not horror , this is pure commercial exploitation of the horror genre in the most shallow , dumb , farcical and materialistic manner .

At first I blamed Wes Craven for these movies, but then I realized that it was screenwriter Kevin Williamson. Hmmm, why are these movies so dumb...? Could it be because that he used to write ""Dawson's Creek"" ? Why is he even bothering trying to ruin the horror genre?

","""Scream 2"" is a movie that asks you to believe another serial killer has targeted young Sidney Prescott (survivor of the first film, and now a college student). If this weren't enough to swallow, her high school friend and fellow survivor from the first film, Randy, conveniently goes to the same university. And wouldn't you know it, along come the other remaining survivors, so now everyone can play along in another round of the same old game. How convenient, eh? Once again, the killer is able to accomplish many things by seemingly pure, blind luck (only in the movies). The opening of the film is a laughable exercise of a series of implausible events that lead to the first deaths in the movie, kick-starting an entire series of conveniences for the killer to do his work aided as if by the gods of Hollywood themselves. Characters manage to get into situations that would only happen in the movies, and the killer is presented with opportunities to chase our poor survivors down school corridors and alleys, all making great scenes that belong right in a movie, yet ironically the characters are self-aware of all the clichés even when they are a part of them."

You would also be carrying around...IF NOTHING ELSE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.. a can of mace. Okay those thoughts aside.

While the first film maintained an intense, suspenseful plot while subtly making comical remarks about the genre, Scream 2 fails to meet any of those aspects.  This film is not nearly as scary as the first, and the ending isn't half as good.

I mean I was guessing, but there were so many to guess from it got boring.  The number of suspects went down as the body count went up.  And then when I found out who the killer was, it was someone that I didn't even care about.  My friend said to me, 'Ha, you never guessed him!'  How was I supposed to.  But this sequel just didn't do what the first one did.  It wasn't any fun to watch.  It relied too much on dead bodies and 'boo' shots to be any good.

","I did not have high expectations for this sequel of the overrated Scream, and I didn't get much.

I didn't like the characters in the first Scream. They annoyed me. Well, the characters in this one are replacements for the victims of the first movie and survivors of Scream. So I hated the characters in this one as well. It is even less frightening than the first one!!! The fresh side of the first one is not there anymore(the movie is almost identical to the original Scream). You know the scenes before you have seen them, since they are the same as the original Scream, and when I say same, I really mean SAME. But as they say in this movie, sequels suck... The killer(or maybe... killerS...) was logical in the first one but this time, it's so stupid(------ SPOILER WARNING: I mean, come on, they introduce a character that you knew nothing about at the end and say it's one of the killers... This makes it impossible to get that ""How could HE do that"" feeling. And another thing, maybe I found this one even weaker than the first one because they killed the best character, Randy. Randy was the best character and they KILLED HIM!------END OF SPOILER---------- Anyway, Scream 2 is even weaker than the first one in my opinion.

"Tweekums","8","1","2","6 July 2019"," A horror sequel that lives up to the original
","Two years have passed since the events in 'Scream' and a film, titled 'Stab', which recounts those events has been released. Two people are murdered at a screening in the town of Windsor... perhaps it is no coincidence that Sidney Prescott, the young woman at the centre of the first film is now attending Windsor College. Inevitably the media, including Gale Weathers, descend on the town and Sidney finds herself the centre of attention again. Also arriving in Windsor are Deputy Dwight ""Dewey"" Riley and Cotton Weary, a man who'd spent a year in jail after Sidney's accusation that he'd killed her mother. Once again a killer wearing the distinctive 'Ghostface' mask starts killing people close to Sidney. As the death toll mounts the finger of suspicion points at various people; including Cotton and Sydney's new boyfriend.<br/><br/>In the first 'Scream' film much was made of the killers following genre rules. This is followed up with discussions of rules for sequels and arguments over whether a sequel can ever match the original... I think this one might even if it inevitably lacks the original's shocking opening. Instead we get the most self-referential opening I can think of with characters watching a shot-for-shot remake of the original, with different cast obviously... this turned out to be a great hook as it reminded the viewer of that film and them propelled them into the sequel. As one would expect there are plenty of fairly gruesome deaths and lots of tension. The central cast are solid; most notably Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox who are great as Sidney and Gale. The identity of the killer isn't too obvious; I'll admit I was convinced it was somebody who turned out to be innocent. Overall I'd say that if you enjoyed the original you should check this out as it is as good and has plenty to add to the story; if you've yet to watch the original you should definitely watch it first."

The film loves subverting expectations at every turn, kills off beloved characters with malicious glee, keeps our leads in constant danger, and actually manages to continue developing the survivors from the first film. In most sequels, if a surviving character returns, they're rendered more or less catatonic (Halloween II) or they're killed off in the opening minutes of the film.<br/><br/>Wes Craven proves once again that he's a master of suspense with a few genuinely nail biting sequences that might just be the best of his career.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled - Scream 2 is way better than you'd ever imagine it would be and well worthy of your time."

Stab will become a stable in the franchise after this movie and is all apart of this movies meta style that runs through the whole franchise.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell is fantastic once again and is definitely the highlight of this franchise I also love the other characters in this one aswell another favourite of mine is definitely Randy which I was shocked by his death the first time I watched the movie and it still gets me today he was a great character.<br/><br/>You also see more of Cotton Weary in this one and it's great that they followed that story on from the original.<br/><br/>The meta style is brillant in this one with the rules of a horror sequel playing full force In this more kills because core audience just expects it that stuff is awesome I love how this franchise plays on that stuff its fantastic and brilliantly.<br/><br/>Just another great entry in the series and my favourite just alot more fun the story is better and I love the kills.<br/><br/>Favourite moment is when Sidney and her friend are in the car and they have to get out through the window and the camera pans over Ghostface it's such and adds alot of suspence to the movie.<br/><br/>Verdict 9.1/10 my favourite in the franchise love every moment"

If some people found it scary, tense and full of terrifying moments, others thought it was fun, laughed and basically ""supported"" the killer. Wes Craven returns to ""attack"" the clichés of teen and horror films, but this time more gently, giving the film an apparently more serious focus. Nevertheless, and despite the film really looks serious and keen to cause fear, its too funny for it and the victims are still too despicable for us to have empathy for them. Only Sidney (Neve Campbell) deserves sympathy, as seems to be the character psychologically more complex and mature. Interesting is also the transformation of Dewey and Gale: that ambitious and egocentric journalist falls in love with the young policeman, who looks a ""good boy"" who can't break a dish, but is now much more mature than in the first film."

Quite clever.<br/><br/>We also get a dramatic increase in star names, which is really saying something with the list of big names in the first.

"bowmanblue","8","1","2","3 June 2015"," Not bad for a sequel
","Yes, the first 'Scream' movie basically reinvented the tired 'slasher' genre and it's still being imitated to this day. I dare say that not even the producers dreamed it would be as popular as it was. Yet it was. Therefore a sequel was almost guaranteed.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about 'Scream' was how 'self aware' it was, constantly parodying its own genre. Therefore, the imaginatively-titled 'Scream 2' had a lot to live up to. Did it? The film itself answers the question. Knowing it's a sequel, one of the characters states that by definition a 'sequel is an inferior product.' I guess he has a case (although the other characters disagree with him!). 'Scream 2' may not be as original as the original (surprise, eh?), but it carries on nicely in the same vain.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell (and the remaining survivors of the first encounter) all return (which is nice and not always common in horror sequels) for this outing where, once again, they're mercilessly stalked by a masked killer. Yes, the plot is pretty simple – as was the original and so many slasher flicks before it – but it works, again. The fact is that there's so many awful slasher/horror films infesting the bargain DVD buckets that this sequel almost seems like a masterpiece in its own right.<br/><br/>Once again there are plenty of 'red herrings' in terms of characters who may or may not be the killer and I doubt anyone will really guess who's behind the mask until it's too late. Neve Campbell is great to root for as the heroine, but David Arquette does tend to steal the show in terms of sheer lovability! It's witty, it's gory and it's fun. If you liked the first, you should enjoy the second and if you like slasher/horror films in general, you should also get something out of this. Yes, like the character 'Randy' says, it may be an inferior product, but don't let that put you off. And don't think too deeply about plot points – but then if you're a fan of the genre you probably do that anyway when it comes to slasher flicks."

A killer begins his spree by attacking two movie goers. Sidney and Randy, fellow students of the victims at Windsor College, attend a press conference that addresses the murders. Dewey arrives on campus to protect her, and Gale arrives with Cotton in the attempt to bring the two together for an interview. Both Dewey and Gale suspect the return of a killer and begin making inquiries into it. The killer continues to stalk the community, attacking a sorority, and makes threatening phone calls, but Sidney's boyfriend, Derek, helps to protect her. Dewey and Gale make progress in their investigation. Two detectives are assigned to protect Sidney. Eventually Randy is murdered, then the two detectives, and then Hallie. In the climax, Derek is murdered, the killer is revealed to be Mickey who worked with Debbie Salt. Gale, Sidney, and Dewey all survive. <br/><br/>There are several topics address in the film through dialog. The first is the lack of an African-American influence in horror films. The heyday of slasher films was in the 80s while Whites still had a very large strong hold. Whether or not they still do is another topic, but the slasher genre was always more concerned about gore and ticket sales; it appealed to a mass ticket going audience. <br/><br/>The second topic is the conversation in film class about sequels. It has to be one of the best dialogs in cinema. Film often takes a second seat to ""fine art"" like statues and paintings. Jaime Kennedy and Timothy Olyphant bring up topics of pop culture, like T2 and Godfather, that help the audience relate and be less cynical about the fact that this is simply another sequel to a slasher movie. <br/><br/>A third topic is the influence of culture on violence. It's a theme very common, as they point out. Bob Dole hit on this heavily and ran for President in '96 the year before ""Scream 2"" came out. These themes are what make ""Scream 2"" better than most horror movies. They have actual themes and topics other than just killing. It's hard to take seriously a mass murdering a movie as very legitimate, so these validate the film and the many emotions that come with it. <br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend this film."
"OllieSuave-007","7","1","2","8 March 2014"," Part 2 of more screams and slashing.
","This is the sequel to one of the definite slasher movies, where two years after the events of ""Scream,"" Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are trying to get on with their lives and are students at Windsor College. When Gale Weathers' (Courteney Cox) novel ""The Woodsboro Murders"" turned into the film, ""Stab,"" of series of killings occur and GhostFace returns. Soon, the stalking, phone calls and screams occur again.<br/><br/>Filmed in a college setting, the actors did provide another believable and serious performance, providing enough drama and suspense to make the horror film watchable and tense. Scary scenes with the killer chasing the victims left and right and the victims hiding and trying to escape from the unseen killer will send chills down your spine and cover your ears to prevent you from being creeped out at those jumping-out-at-you moments, which are more in abundance than in the previous film; the part where Sidney creeps up to the car to see if the unmoving GhostFace character is dead or alive.<br/><br/>With these teen-flick types of horror movies, it has its fair share of corny and lame moments. Sarah Michelle Gellar is my favorite actor, though, in the movie and she took on a role similar to that of Drew Barrymorre in the previous film, engaging, suspenseful and memorable. But, her cynical and determined attitude give the plot more excitement. Overall, not a bad horror sequel.<br/><br/>Grade B-"

","I know the rule of movies; sequels can NEVER be better than the originals. But in Scream's case this rule is broken. Scream 2 is not only better than the original film but it's also got a better group to back the original leads Sidney, Dewey, and Gale up. Jerry O'Connell, Jamie Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, and Marisol Nichols all take part in this great sequel and whether their roles are short or long, they are appreciated.<br/><br/>Scream did however mess with one thing in it's years; the self aware aspect. It works in this film, and it's good because the film, like I said, knows when to be scary and knows when to be witty. The sad thing is Scream did so well that now it makes other horror films like newer installments of Friday the 13th and I Know What You Did Last Summer feel like they need to be self aware to be good. Not the case.<br/><br/>Scream has the right writing and direction to accomplish such a goal. The characters know they are in a real life sequel. Wes Craven knew what he wanted to do and screenwriter Kevin Williamson knew how to be good with references without going too overboard. Nowadays this concept is beyond overused and is now becoming a tiresome and dreary old form of comedy/horror. Only Scream could accomplish it correctly.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is relatively the same thing as it's predecessor. Only now the lead characters have all seen a film called Stab which is the movie version of the murders they were involved with. Sort of like Scream is a movie about itself. Following? Well, same formula here. The characters know every horror movie cliché and instead of making the usual mistakes, they come up with ways to do their own mistakes.<br/><br/>I like the cast a lot more in the sequel. We get Jerry O'Connell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Timothy Olyphant, Omar, Epps, and even Marisol Nichols has a brief cameo. The cast is perfect. A great addition to a worthy sequel. Normally I don't like sequels more than the originals. But Scream 2 manages to accomplish a bit more than the first.<br/><br/>The question at this point is how much more steam does the Scream series have? We have a third film that came out in 2000, and a fourth film in the series, released in 2011. Is Scream going to run itself down? Or will prove worthy of so many sequels and show that you can't ever scream too much? Starring: David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Kennedy, Jerry O'Connell, Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett, Liev Schreiber, Rebecca Gayheart, and Marisol Nichols. Directed by: Wes Craven."

","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>Just a year later, and the gang's back. Director Craven and screenwriter Williamson are back for a second round. And this time, it's with good intentions. Necessary? I perhaps not, but effective? Certainly. The body count's increasing, and the games are back and better than ever.<br/><br/>What separates ""Scream 2"" from the other lackluster sequels is how true it stays to its source material, while bringing something new to the table. In my opinion, while ""Scream"" was unpredictable, this film is definitely more surprising in terms of the whodunit premise. There are tons of twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Not to mention the performances are still strong. The characters have matured and are evolving in their roles, which is always welcome. The script... what can I say? The one liners pack the same hard punch, and the lines are delivered greatly. As for the suspense, there's definitely more where that came from. ""Scream 2"" doesn't skimp on the goods.<br/><br/>Also, remember the iconic 12-minute opening in ""Scream"". Yeah well, ""Scream 2""'s is just as great. Without spoiling too much, the setting's at a movie theatre, and boy does it not disappoint.<br/><br/>Anything else? While this is one neat production, I thought the film was bloodier, but not gorier. ""Scream"", in terms of deaths, is stronger, whereas ""Scream 2"" consists of mostly just stabs and ounces of that red stuff. <br/><br/>""Scream 2"" is another home run for Craven. The film might closely resemblance ""Scream"" (maybe a little TOO closely), but it offers just a little something special for the beloved fans. ""Scream 2"" is as good, if not, better than its predecessor."
"howellgirl2011","9","1","2","21 January 2011"," Ghostface is back and this time he means business, as in killing Sydney once and for all!
","The film was great because you would never suspect anyone in a film based on a murder to start recreating the murders for real and not just fake stuff. I thought the film was good because at the beginning 2 people are watching Stab(a film based on Woodsboro murders)when the real killer, instead of fake ones in the theater, murders them and calmly leaves blaming lots of innocent people who didn't know that the killer was in the same room as they are in. But now Sydney is in college and loving it. And is trying to get over the murders from the previous film and lives nearby Dewey's home with a big security system. I personally thought that when Ghost-face had them in the police car I thought that he would crash the car resulting in everyone inside dying suddenly upon impact. But I was scared to death when Sydney was making her way out of the car window(as in the front driver's window the only exit). I was holding my breath when she crawled out and stared down the killer who was temporarily knocked unconscious. For at least five minutes or so. Until he gets out mysteriously and kills Sydney's friend right in front of her. I was scared to death when Cotton was deciding whether or not to kill Sydney or let her live. I was like ""let her live please, the mother is crazy, kill her, not her!"" I was holding my breath when he had finally decided to let her live and kill the mom instead. Because he had forgiven her and thought that she had deserved to live instead of the crazy mom breathing down her neck."
"spotlessmind03","7","1","2","4 January 2011"," As Good a Sequel as There Ever Could Be
","Where Kevin Williamson's screenplay drew upon the rules of slasher movies as an inspiration for a teen killer in ""Scream"", his script for the sequel in turn recognizes the rules and traditions of popular horror sequels and references itself constantly as being aware of this status.<br/><br/>""Scream 2"" isn't as well put together as the first but director Wes Craven manages to make a pretty scary and intriguing horror romp out of Williamson's script, cleverly mixing scares and in-joke humor together to rush out a sequel to one of the greatest teen horror satires ever. There are real moments of terror in the story, which finds Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) once again dealing with a psycho slasher in a ghost mask who is stalking her and her close friends in a pleasant Ohio college town. Courteney Cox reprises her role as reporter Gale Weathers, who turned out to be an unexpected hero in ""Scream"" and returns to gain more fame, capitalizing on the murders taking place at Sidney's school. David Arquette also returns as the funny Deputy Dewey and his scenes with Gale are some of the best comic moments in the film. The cast is better in this sequel, and besides the main trio of Campbell, Cox and Arquette, Jamie Kennedy returns as movie buff Randy, and you've also got appearances by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jerry O'Connell, and even the always delightful Laurie Metcalfe (of ""Roseanne"" fame) in a hilarious cameo role as an aspiring reporter.<br/><br/>Where the film is overlong, it proves itself to be an ultimately entertaining and clever retread of the first. ""Scream 2"" still takes the time to establish its characters and environment before people start getting picked off by the killer. Wes Craven has an eye for scary chase scenes and these are the highlight of the film. Among these are a jolting car chase, a clever revamp of the opening from the first film set in a sorority house, and even a surprise moment of horror in a crowded movie theater at the premiere of ""Stab"", ironically, a film within a film gimmick based on the events of the first film. It's touches like this that keep ""Scream 2"" above routine slasher material, but not for long. The twist (that is to say, who ""Ghostface"" actually turned out to be) was genuinely unexpected, even more so than the first, and echoes some classic twists from earlier films in the genre that inspired ""Scream"" itself. Craven is still at the top of his game stylistically but it doesn't get much better than the original ""Scream""."
"RyanCShowers","Null","1","2","23 August 2010"," Part 2 Continues to ""WOW""
","The Scream Trilogy is the film series that redefined fear. They revived the horror genre. The one Alfred Hitchcock sunned everyone with Psycho. The one John Carpenter's Halloween brought serial killers afloat to. Even our own Wes Craven did by scaring us in the only place we found comfort in with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Now, with the Scream trilogy, the horror genre was brought back to life continuing the face of iconic fear. <br/><br/>Wes Craven, as mentioned before, is the master of suspense. When Kevin Williamson's script was out on the prow, Craven was really the only proper choice to direct. His method of scaring the audience never fails. He has so much control over the three stories without the feeling of ""over-directing"". For many years, Freddy Kruger was hailed as Craven's masterpiece, this trilogy is now and will be his crowning achievement. <br/><br/>Kevin Williamson wrote the original and the sequel, then Ehren Kruger came along to write the third when Williamson declined. However, Williamson basically outlined the story for Kruger, leaving the dialogue and details to Kruger. All three scripts are absolutely incredible and tantalizing original. The story grows as the series continues and it becomes more intricate. <br/><br/>Now, it'd be tough to choose between the three, which is my favorite. But, I think as the story becomes more complicated, I was more intrigued, which may be the only factor to say the films get better as we go along. That aside, the three are so close together with quality, entertainment, suspense, and as films overall. It's difficult for a film trilogy to achieve that. Most times, sequels get worse, but here? No such thing.<br/><br/>The thing that really separates Scream from the average film series besides the screenplay, the direction, the suspense level, the tech stuff, and the visuals is the acting. This is what I call true acting ensemble. <br/><br/>The two dazzlingly standouts are Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox. What performances. Now, it's no surprise that Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are in all three films. So Campbell and Cox have to sustain their performances over three films. It's extraordinary. David Arquette, I'll check him off first. He is funny and dorky in the first two films. He really adds to the table in Scream 3. He finally ""grows up"" and isn't as insecure, which is a lovely thing to see.<br/><br/>You see the actors grow and fall as their characters. Campbell really finds Sidney Prescott, the true essence of the character. Campbell does something tricky here. She shows us a girl who is in a horrible place in her life, who is strong and can make it in the world, but is also vulnerable and weak. It's tricky, but she pulls it off with grace. Sidney is this tormented young woman, and Campbell never shies away from that; how she can act with her eyes can simply not be put into words, it's that great. <br/><br/>Courteney Cox is fierce as Gale Weathers. She leaves her comfy zone (the control freak Monica Geller on Friends). Cox steps up the dramatic work here, especially in Scream 2. The character Gale Weathers grows from being a ""wannabe"" b*tch, to being a successful and rub it in your face more of a b*tch. Then in Scream 3, she changes. After her true feelings for Dewey were revealed in Scream 2, Gale was tamed and not so much of the witch she once was. I've mentioned her dramatic work in Scream 2 a few times. It is simply the best of her career. In Scream 1, she was hinting that she had feelings for Dewey, but also hinting she was using him for information. In Scream 2, she finally lets lose and says 'I don't care,"" and gives in. Right as she confesses herself, the situation diminishes. Cox is so good in the scene where she is the sound room and sees Dewey being stabbed through the mirrors (to what she thought was his death). It's heartbreaking. <br/><br/>In Scream 2, Jada Pinkette is hilarious, without a funny character. Her section of the film is awesome and a great follow-up to Barrymore's from the original film. Sarah Michelle Gellar also has a small role here and makes the most of her seven-minute screen time. Laurie McCalf is also very good here. Jamie Kennedy, who survived the first film reprises his role here and it's always a fun time when he's on the screen.<br/><br/>The Screams are also grand on the technical scale, too. The ghostface costume has become the most frightening, iconic horror film costume. It screams fear. The brilliance of it is, this mask wasn't made specifically for the film. I was a regular Halloween costume sold in stores everywhere. That's what makes it scarier. The great master, Wes Craven once said, ""Something isn't scary unless people can identify with it and could possibly be in the same positions as the characters on the screen. The films also include a killer score and frightening sets (especially John Milton's house, where the climax of Scream 3 takes place).<br/><br/>Bob Weinstein, the producers of the Scream trilogy, now demanded a fourth installment. Why? To make a few bucks? Scream fits perfectly as a trilogy, without any loose ends and had a wonderful ending filled with metaphors and a great chase scene. Williamson is back writing. Having him back on board with Craven directing and three survivors back gives me some comfort that it won't fail completely, but I'm scared for it's survival. Let's just hope for the best. <br/><br/>Overall, without a doubt, the best trilogy ever made. My personal favorite films; they're fun, very scary, with excellent performances, writing and directing. What more could you want? The three easiest 10s I've ever given."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","16 May 2010"," A Bloody Good Time!
","Scream 2 is probably one of the most successful horror sequels to ever come out. It has the same tone, the same tongue-in-cheek attitude, and the same love for movies as the first does. It has some great direction from Craven, and again he makes it a bloody good time to tune in to the blood and the killings, and the who-done-it mystery. Neve Campbell is again very good as the protagonist, as is David Arquette. Courtney Cox delivers once again in giving us an unlikeable yet ultimately loving character as the film progresses, and her Gail Weathers is a very complicated persona. Sarah Michelle Gellar has the best chase scene in the film, and probably the best chase scene in any Scream film (together in the same year with what I consider the best chase sequence of all time in I Know What You Did Last Summer). Overall, this is a more than satisfying horror sequel, and stands equally in the same bar as Scream, if not higher."

Also, at first, you'll find it pretty scary. Also, I thought the films were pretty original and they have a few laughs. But the problem I had with the films, which really isn't a problem, is that after you've seen them a few times, you know what's going to happen. I don't blame the film, I blame myself. Because I have seen the Scream films many times. I think that the Scream trilogy is funny and fun to watch. Scream 2 is even bloodier than the first film, I think. Not that the first film wasn't bloody. In the first film, you saw two people get their insides put on the outside. Cut out of course.

"Marisol33","8","1","2","6 September 2009"," Almost Better than the original
","Wes Craven hits it big again with this amazing sequel! NO one was really expecting this to be better than the original, ( most sequels SUCK ) but this was a much anticipated movie and hit hard hwen it came out. This very closely came to surpassing the original. Sydney still believes that there is a killer waiting to get her, and she's right, with a movie about her life coming out, more muders start to occur. And she soon again finds herself in the middle of vicious murders. And she finds out that it is again a tag team duo, Micky, the freaky film student, and Billy's mother, who also, like her son, seeks good old fashion revenge.... What made this movie so populare was that it took Scream to a new level, bringing in other stars, and having movies inside a movie, and it mixed comedy with horror. Tastefuly, in one of hte first secens, we meet a college class discussing how sequels suck. This all thrown into one makes for a fun movie that is packed with it's share of thrills. I liked the sequel it was better than most sequels turn out however I still prefer the first but it was satisfactory to my demands. The premise of the sequel is that the survivors of the first movie all go on to college as well as three new members to the group and after the movie Stab based on what had happened to them last year came out two people were murdered and they think that they could be next so they are now wondering if it is a person trying to make a real life sequel. I would recommend this to people who have for one thing seen the first movie and liked it. Also if you are going to watch this make sure that you are thirteen or older otherwise it will be to violent for you. Second of all my advice would be for you to watch it with a friend otherwise you may be afraid to pick up the phone if they call. I hope that this review has helped you in making a decision about whether or not you will watch this movie!"
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","2","20 August 2009"," Lacks the screams but still a highly enjoyable thriller
","Sidney Prescott (Campbell) is traumatized when a film of her deadly experiences is released, and soon a killer replicating the movie starts killing her friends.<br/><br/>In the sequel to the hugely popular Scream comes an equally enjoyable horror flick that presents mystery and intrigue right up until the well choreographed if slightly exaggerated climax.<br/><br/>The characters who were not assassinated in the first film return with a bang in this picture, most notably Neve Campbell's Sidney who is trying to move on after her gruesome showdown with her boyfriend and psycho partner 2 years previously. But a gruesome murder spree at a local cinema at a screening of 'Stab' soon has suspicions raised as once more the Ghost mask is present.<br/><br/>This now infamous murderer starts handpicking victims one by one and the way this story is told, there is no apparent reason and pattern to these killings, which generates a wonderful sense of mystery. In a sense this sequel is like a good crime novel. An obvious target, a couple of red herrings, gruesome murders and a gasping realization come the final part. In a way it's a shame to find out the identity of said killer as the mystery and unfathomable story is so well told you almost don't want to know. Sadly however every film has an end and with this comes a shocking realization and exciting final battle.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell once more excels as the lead, being quietly aggressive and opinionated without being too squeamish in her paranoia. David Arquette receives a more inquisitive role in this sequel which takes into account his more vulnerable personality as Dewy with Courtney Cox as great and present as the annoying reporter.<br/><br/>Wes Craven's approach to this sequel is, as Randy so eloquently puts it, have more deaths which are more elaborate and gory as the film's predecessor. Initially this statement seems to be tried and tested trivia but when the film gets into the latter stages we see the point as the deaths get hotter and heavier as the pace rounds to tension.<br/><br/>With Scream the surprise and shock of the murderer kept the tempo at razor edge as clues and hints mislead us right until the jaw dropping finale, not to forget that there were a few jumpy moments in and amongst the gripping chases. With this sequel there are very few jump scenes and the conceptual genre of horror is left purely down to the gruesome killings. In a sense this is a more adept movie concentrating on the story rather than going for full out jumps. Whether you like jumping behind the sofa or be engaged physiologically remains irrelevant once the pace starts. There are nervous scenes but this doesn't generate the fear factor you may want from a horror film.<br/><br/>Is this better than the original? No, purely because the first hit was so surprising and had the jumps and the tension, it made a complete horror. Do not be discouraged as where this may lack the freak-out factor; it is fast and highly enjoyable."
"Mr_Censored","7","1","2","19 June 2009"," ""Scream 2"" overcomes some obstacles to end up a respectable sequel and counterpart.
","Wes Craven's ""Scream"" was such a smashing success that a sequel was quickly rushed into production, and in 1997, ""Scream 2"" was born. Re-uniting Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson, the film also saw the return of its surviving stars as well as the now-iconic Ghostface killer, who, for obvious reasons, carries an alternate identity than that of the killer(s) in the first film. Stalking Sidney and her friends at college, the film centers around the damaged character and the paranoia that continues to cripple her life. As Deputy Dewey puts it: ""You probably already know him...or her...or them. They're probably already in your life. They get off on that.""<br/><br/>The film can't help but feel redundant when compared to its predecessor, especially when it comes to its surprise finish. That's not to say the film is a complete re-hash though. Thankfully, it still puts your expectations through the loops and keeps you on the edge of your seat with some nail-biting suspense and gruesome blood-shed. In fact, when you compare it to other like-minded films of the time (see: ""Scream"" rip-offs), it's downright nasty and fun at the same time! The college campus setting also helps change things up a bit, and with so many horror sequels ripe for the picking, ""Scream 2"" is to horror sequels what ""Scream"" was to horror movies in general. It ups the ante, raises your expectations and (for the most part) meets them.<br/><br/>The direction by Craven seems a little more confident this go-round, which is unfortunate since Williamson's script gives its characters clunky and awkward dialogue to spit, which severely drags down the film. The first one was whip-smart, but this one's a little milder. The tone of the flick and the overall plot is just-right; it's in the little things that bog the flick down. Even still, its flaws are minor, and it's got another great, talented cast, some of whom meet unfortunate and grisly demises. Keep an eye out for wacky Aunt Jackie from ""Roseanne"" herself, Laurie Metcalf, in a seemingly minor but memorable role."

","well I'm quite fond of the scream franchise, i will say scream 2 would be second rate out of the trilogy. it shows all the cast of the original reprising their roles, the character I'm most fond of is Courtney cox's(Gail weathers). the story is a bit weak towards the original and the scares are not as good as the first. but it is enjoyable to watch. i like the way they cast Sarah Michelle gellar in the film but not the way they killed her off, i think she is good in horror films. it is bloodier than the first, the good part of the story i like is when the trio find out when the firsts killers mother is the killer in this and the tense finale. my actually favorite scene in the film is when dooy and Gail meet up again for the first time in the film and the music playing compliments it, all in all the film is okay,if it was more scary and more like the original,the story is good but the scare factor should be better. its good but not great."

So I really have no choice, and will prefer it to a movie that just bored me to the point where I had to shut it off well before the end.<br/><br/>But anyways, in the tradition of almost any sequel of any genre, the first is always or almost always the superior here. This is of no exception to the rule despite humor to the contrary at first where the film-students boast & brag about sequels being better such as the case of Empire Strikes Back etc. In fact, after having seen bits of 3 too, I'd have to say this was the worst installment yet! They even go out of their way to make fun of themselves in the middle of the movie. And that ought to give you a clue that this is a genuine joke of a 'horror movie' in itself. The humor though is kinda stale after a while. On the other hand, however, it is nice to see that someone doesn't take himself that seriously like most others, despite the fact that they do tend to make their audience laugh rather than scream as intended.<br/><br/>Anyways, no tits/almost no blood -- yep, a 2 in my book.

","Given the success of the original Scream, it is inevitable that there would be a sequel, bringing back cast members from the first movie who survived the massacre (Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox), and adding new popular faces that would add to the body count, like the underutilized Sarah Michelle Gellar.<br/><br/>In case you've forgotten the iconic beginnings of this franchise, it is again reprised with a movie within a movie, as Gail Weather's (Cox) successful book about the incident has been turned into a movie called Stab, starring Heather Graham in Drew Barrymore's role, and David Schwimmer (not seen though) and Tori Spelling in the roles of Arquette's and Campbell's respectively. It's an incredibly cheesy beginning, which stayed true to the way the original was played out, and guest stars Jada Pinkett Smith too.<br/><br/>With the original Scream poking fun at slasher flicks in general, this sequel pokes fun at, you'd guess it, sequels. A new copycat serial killer is in town and stalking Sidney (Campbell) and the surviving gang has to race against time to try and find out who this sicko might be. Could it be a copycat down to the last detail such that Sidney's new boyfriend, an alpha-male jock, is involved? Or one of the surviving cast from the first film? Or how about the innocently accused Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who's released from prison, and wanting to get back at Sidney for putting him in jail? The gore factor definitely has been reduced (or was it because I was watching a Code 3 version?) and relies on the usual soundtrack crescendos to pull in the screams (put intended)? And speaking of the soundtrack, there were moments were Broken Arrow's was used liberally throughout. The in-jokes and numerous references which made the first Scream a darling, were sadly missed in the sequel.<br/><br/>The ending again is a twist when the killer is revealed. Though like all predictable villains, a long extended monologue always seemed to be the order of the day. Guess that's just the way the genre goes. Like what was mentioned, there are only a few sequels which surpass their originals, and sadly, Scream 2 is not one of them.<br/><br/>Code 3 DVD was a barebones version, nothing special included, which is a pity."
"TheNorthernMonkee","6","1","2","9 August 2005"," entertaining, but forced
","SPOILERS One year after 'Scream' gave life to a dying genre, this entertaining but incredibly forced sequel was released. Continuing the story with the old survivors plus new casualties, 'Scream 2' is a fun affair, without ever actually returning to the highs of the original. Blatantly attempting to resurrect the glory imposed on the first outing, it manages to remain immensely predictable for the majority before hitting you with an exquisite twist at the end.<br/><br/>Two years later and Sidney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) life appears to be back on track. Happily settled at college, she still gets the occasional prank call, but will happily laugh it off thanks to caller ID. Yes, with a new 'perfect' boyfriend and life sorted, for Sidney life can only go wrong. So let's not be surprised when suddenly a copycat killer begins to replicate the events of the past.<br/><br/>Yet again the amazing Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson present us with the life of Sidney Prescott. With bad acting and some weak lines, you do know what your going to get with these films, and in regards to blood, you are rarely surprised. Ultimately though, the film is lacking. Less intellectual than it's predecessor, you only begin to grasp the genius at work when the eccentric film buffs class is taking place and every man and his dog pokes fun at the regularly inferior 'sequel'. This in itself is a brilliant masterstroke by writer Williamson who is blatantly aware of how this film will fail to live up to the original. Williamson is in fact so definite on this fact, that he abandons the intelligence soon after this early scene and resorts to jokes about the cast ('Friends' jokes for Courtney Cox, references to the cast of the film 'Stab' which is being made as a tribute to the original film) and the surprise twist at the end. Aside from these though, Williamson's input is limited and lacking in comparison with what he achieve in the first film.<br/><br/>The other problem of course is the same reason why so many sequels fail to live up to their predecessor, mainly that they are not original. 'Scream' changed horror and it did it in a fresh and keen way. In contrast 'Scream 2' is just another entry into the curriculum vitae of the cast and nothing new. Yes the plot is new and yes we do have new characters, but the feelings you get from watching a ground breaking film are absent. The film in effect, is like the first film but without the relevance.<br/><br/>'Scream 2' is not a bad film to watch. Often entertaining, albeit in a predictable way, it does provide a few key moments. That's all that can really be said about it however. Once again the acting is weak, and once again you don't care because most of the characters will die. The film is basically a repeat of it's predecessor but without the charm, intelligence and original feel. Watch it and be amused, but don't expect too much. Your average teenage horror story."
"slayrrr666","9","1","2","4 June 2004"," Just as entertaining as the original, but maybe slightly better
","'Scream 2' is probably the only film in the trilogy that should not have gotten the bad reviews that it received.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>While attending the premiere of the new horror film 'Stab,' a young couple, (Omar Epps and Jada Painkett) are viciously murdered. The film is based on the events of the first 'Scream.' During a year off at college, Sidney (Neve Campbell) is tormenting her roommate, Hallie (Elise Neal) so she seeks out friend Randy (Jaime Kennedy) to shed some light on what happened in the theater. Due to the event, Gale (Courtney Cox) and Dewey (David Arquette) arrive at the school to probe the relationship between what happened. The man who she accused of murdering her mother, Cotton Weary (Live Schrieber) also visits Sidney's college to get the truth from her about him. With Sidney at a party on campus, one of her friends, Cici (Sarah Michelle Geller) is killed. Sidney's boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell) is quick to dismiss the fact that the killer is after Sidney, but she knows better once she receives the same phone calls as before. He realizes it's true once the killer attacks Sid and Derek in a sorority house. Gale and Dewey begin to realize that a killer is trying to recreate the crimes of the original. Dewey turns to Randy to learn the rules of horror movie sequels. Sidney becomes more and more convinced that the killer is coming after her, but he instead kills one of her friends. Sidney believes that Cotton still is the killer, but the cops don't and release him. She now races to save her friends before the killer finds them and kills them.<br/><br/>The Good News: Truly original sequel in the trilogy that never really got the due credits it deserved. Personally, it's my favorite in the trilogy and I think it's better than the first one. The original was great, but part 2 has a certain charm that the first one didn't. The all-star cast isn't it, but I just enjoy watching this one. The gore is slightly toned down, but I don't mind that. It fit the tone of the film. The real reason why I enjoy this one is that the comedy is completely gone to the point of it being not even relevant to the film. As a hard-core horror film fan, I really hated that part about 'Scream' where it took itself too mockingly. It was a film that was being resentful of horror movies while being a horror movie, while maybe being the creative spark that re-ignited horror films, I thought was something that I thought never should've come from Wes Craven, who's made many of the films in my top 20. It was a breath of fresh air for this series, even after the mediocre part 3. The one other good thing for part 2 that the others didn't have was real suspense. Who couldn't forget the nerve-wrecking escape from the cop car? The other cool scene is the school dance, where Sid learns that she is dancing with the killer among a group of similar masked dancers. It could've been played out longer, but it was still really creepy. The other good part of this movie is that I noticed Craven going back to his roots with the movie, showing roving cameras and claustrophobic sets that remind viewers of his earlier masterpieces. The ending is a great example of this. A ten-minute sequence revolving around one place and time that kept you riveted to your seat and tied up loose ends at the same time is a great example of Craven at his best.<br/><br/>The Bad News: The killer(s) motive is rather hackneyed and almost unbelievable. Wanting to blame the killings for being inspired by the recent horror film that was itself inspired by the events in the first movie was almost nonsensical and completely moronic. Craven has always been a master of incorporating a great and original premise in his movies, even in his clunker movies. It has been a real trademark in his films, and here he really misses the mark. I know he wanted to compliment on the recent, or at the time recent, controversies involving the violence in horror movies, but it is really tacked on and almost an afterthought. It should've been reworked into a more believable reason for the killer(s). <br/><br/>The Final Verdict: This is one of the rare horror film sequels that nearly surpasses the original in popularity, but it deserves to be seen. It is really creepy, the body count is pretty big, and it keeps you riveted, as you never do guess the killer(s) in the film. It is highly recommended to slasher fans and to those who have been turned off of horror because of 'Scream's' success at lampooning their favorite genre.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language"
"one4now4","Null","1","2","24 October 2003"," Just wanted to give a nice, little review, that's all
","NOT! I am here to trash all over ""Scream 2"" and the myriad of movies just like it. (Please note that ""Scream"" part one is still a good movie if you can try to forget the awfulness of sequels like this and tons of rip-offs, and their sequels, too!) Alright, first of all: The writing was pretty stale by this entry because ""Scream"" part one was so big that within a year or so this self-referentiality stuff was already devoid of its once clever flair. (And, just to make the fact known, there were many self-referential horror movies done before ""Scream"", meaning Wes Craven really did nothing new.) Next: The one really fun character left from part one was Jamie Kennedy's character, the video geek that all of us horror-obsessed video geeks could relate to. He gets offed halfway through the movie after making one of the only clever jokes in this entire mess. I'm sure Craven did this to be unpredictable and shock audiences by depicting the death of a character they cared about. Why didn't that stuck-up, ""capitalist-with-a-heart-of-gold"" character of Courtney Cox's get offed? I guess Craven couldn't please everybody, but it was a pretty bad idea no matter how many critics said he was being ""hip and smart"". Reason number three comin' up: The ending was not a stunning surprise like in the first film. It seemed almost as if Craven tacked on some lackluster footage at the last minute (which is pretty believable when you consider the fact that he wrote a few different endings to this). Yes, this is just another ""Friday the 13th"" sequel, except without the gore and sleazy nudity that kept those films from being totally dull. So the next time someone who praises crap like this out the wazoo is about to trash on a much better low-budget film, remember that the budget is not what makes a movie good. Just as Jello from the Dead Kennedys criticized the MTV ""culture"" in that band's classic song ""MTV Get Off the Air"", what are you people? Accountants or movie fans?"
"AlyAmber","Null","1","2","10 August 2003"," What's your favorite scary movie?
","This movie has got to be one of the BEST horror movies out there. I know alot of you will probably disagree, but it's a classic. Neve Campbells performance is amazing. That girl can act!!!! I was very disappointed at one thing though. I did not like to see Miss Jada Pinkett-Smith killed off so quickly. I think she would have been a great addition to the story had she been able to stick around longer. She's always been one of my favorite actresses. The whole plot of the movie is genius. There are no movies out there like the Scream Trilogy!!  Not only are they scary, they are hilarious. If you want to get scared and laugh your @ss off while doing it.....you need to see these movies."
"BillyBC","Null","1","2","3 June 2003"," Not quite as good as the original, but possibly funnier...
","(*** out of *****)<br/><br/>This sequel is even more of an homage to late-70s and early-80s slashers than the first one.  It borrows generously from such college-campus-killer classics as ""Black Christmas,"" ""He Knows You're Alone"" (the opening scene) and ""Final Exam"" (the hazing scene) as well as the original ""Friday the 13th.""  This is not quite as good as the first, and parts of it are a bit tedious (for example, anyone else notice how the killer(s) is always getting his ass kicked by Neve Campbell, but then seems to have no trouble taking on TWO burly police detectives?), but it still has enough clever twists, amusing dialogue and suspenseful set pieces to make it enjoyable.  I love how this movie even satirizes itself by having the movie-within-a-movie storyline (""Stab,"" with Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson, and Heather Graham!)  Along with Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Kennedy (from the first film), we get new victims Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett Smith, and `Buffy,' herself, Sarah Michelle Geller.  Rebecca Gayheart and Portia de Rossi are also pretty funny as airhead sorority girls, but Arquette and Kennedy are the two funniest ones to watch this time around (there scene together in the diner is the comic-highlight of the film.)<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHT:  Well, either the above-mentioned diner scene or the scene where Campbell and her friend (Elise Neal) have to squeeze past the unconscious body of the killer from the back seat of a wrecked police car."

"LebowskiT1000","7","1","2","23 August 2002"," Another Teen Slasher Movie, it's ok.
","I'm not a fan of the teen-slasher genre, or horror in it's entirety for that matter, that's probably why it's taken me nearly 5 years to finally sit down and watch this sequel.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I wasn't really a huge fan of the original ""Scream"", well, it was ok, but I didn't think it was anything great.  So, I had pretty low expectations of this film and on top of that, I've had a number of friends say that this is the worst in the series.  Needless to say, my expectations had hit rock-bottom!<br/><br/>After seeing the film, I must say that I thought it was pretty good.  I don't know where I'd put this film compared to the first one, probably about the same likability for me.  I thought this film had a lot of good things going for it, I thought the story was pretty good and really kept you guessing.  I also REALLY liked the comedy in this film, David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy crack me up!  The only major complaint I have about this film is that they killed my favorite character in the series!  I won't give it away for those of you that haven't seen it, but the choices are pretty limited, there were only 5 or so actors that were in both ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" (and only one of them dies in part 2, so when you see the film you'll know who I'm talking about).<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good in this film, I really enjoyed the cast in this film.  There were a lot of familiar faces and a lot of cameos: Tori Spelling, Heather Graham, Sarah Michelle Gellar, David Warner, Wes Craven, Joshua Jackson, Portia de Rossi, Omar Epps, and perhaps some others that I missed.  The core cast was really good as well: Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Jerry O'Connell, Liev Schreiber and everyone else. Great cast!<br/><br/>I guess if you're into teen-slasher films and liked the first ""Scream"" film, then you should definitely check this out.  I can't promise you'll like it as much as the first film, as most of my friends didn't, but you never know. Well, if you do see the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-Chris"
"chrisbrown6453","7","1","2","17 June 2002"," Scream 2 had to be one of the most anticipated films of 1997. And when it was finally released, you weren't disappointed.
","Picking up two years after the original, we find young Sydney in college, with her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy, the horror movie buff) and some new friends she's picked up along the way (including Jerry O'Connell as her new boyfriend). Reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is also back. Seems she's written a book about Sydney and her life, and it's been turned into a movie called Stab! At the premiere of Stab! a couple of people are killed, and everyone thinks its all starting over again. To the aid of young Sydney comes Dewey (David Arquette) who has seen better days. Soon people all over campus are being killed by someone in a Scream mask. Who is it this time? Everyone's a suspect, and everyone seems to have a motive. The only real difference between Scream 2 and the original is now you're sort of ready for the twists and turns. Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson still serve up horror clichés, then shoot them down, but it's not as unexpected as before. But that doesn't mean the movie isn't as fun as the first. You still can't guess who the killer is until they decide to tell you (although I was a little disappointed in the ending). And the movie does slow down a little in the middle. Just before sitting down to watch Scream 2 I watched a copy of the original that had Craven and Williamson talking about the movie as it was happening. They mentioned that one of the producers told them they needed to kill someone off in the middle (turned out to be the principal) because you couldn't have a horror film where no one died for half an hour, and I wish they had done something like that here. The movie is still filled with pop-culture references (how many movies can mention Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and the fact that The Empire Strikes back wasn't a sequel but a continuation of a trilogy?)<br/><br/>
The main reason the original was fun was because it didn't assume that the audience is stupid, and just want a lot of blood and guts. Williamson knows that today's horror fans are more sophisticated, and expect a movie that makes sense. I enjoyed the movie a lot, and probably will go see it again. In the movie Randy at one point said, sequels suck. With this one, he was wrong. Here's looking to Scream 3."
"Big Movie Fan","Null","1","2","17 May 2002"," Nothing Special But Not Too Bad!
","The original Scream movie is the best in my opinion. When Scream came out it was a shot in the arm for the horror genre which was slowly dying a painful death. Scream 2 was not the most memorable film but it had it's moments.<br/><br/>It's one of those films where you don't know the identity of the killer who slashes his/her way through loads of victims. Everyone is a suspect in this film. No-one is above suspicion. And just like the original Scream there are plenty of red herrings along the way.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Liev Schreiber reprise their roles from the original film. Could one of them be the killer? Could it be someone who wasn't in the original film? Is it a man? Is it a woman? You'll have to buy the film and see.<br/><br/>I must admit that I didn't correctly guess the identity of the killer but then again I've never been good at solving mysteries."

"silverfish","4","1","2","30 October 2001"," A disappointing sequel
","The problem with this film is that after the original that showed up some of the cliches in horror films, this seems to be trying to invent its own.  One in particular is the tendency for characters to split up for no apparent reason, allowing the killer to kill one of them.<br/><br/>The plot is not as good as that of the original, with quite a few holes in it.  The first killing in the original was very well executed, and convincing, but in this, the first killing is poorly executed and unconvincing, although the idea behind it is quite good.<br/><br/>This film is probably worth watching, but does not have the spark of originality that the original had.  It is scary in places, and has funny moments but this is by no means as good as the original was."
"Kuntos_the_Destroyer","5","1","2","29 September 2001"," ""Sequels suck!""
","Or so says one of the characters early on in Scream 2, which is followed by a short discussion about sequels that might just be better than the original. Is Scream 2 one of them? Definitely not. The first Scream film worked well because it played with the rules of the slasherflick (although it is far less original in this than you might think, as Wes Craven's own New Nightmare did pretty much the same thing) without subverting them and because it brought a much needed energy back into the genre. I don't think Scream is a true horror classic (I didn't think it was very scary), but it's still great fun. Scream 2 aimes for pretty much the same thing. It's another postmodern slasher where the characters know the rules of the genre and where the filmmakers play around with them.<br/><br/>Sometimes, it still works. The whole sequel-discussion will please anyone with a casual interest in film, the cameos by Heather Graham and Tori Spelling (as Neve Campbell's character in the movie-within-the-movie based on the events in Scream) are cleverly inserted into the film and there's even a hint the filmmakers are trying to confound the audience' expectations (one slashing is an example in particular). It's not as though Kevin Williamson's film-literate script is a complete waste of time. But apart from these clever flourishes, there's very little here. Sure, he throws in 'subtexts' like the media's obsession with violence and, more notably and bravely, the whole relationship between violence in media (and film in particular) and in real-life. But as it doesn't do a lot with its subtexts, so what you're left with is your usual barrage of killings and a whodunnit storyline. And a lot of it isn't nearly as sharp as Scream. The dialogue has its moments, but the character interplay is as shallow as possible and there's an awful scene where Neve Campbell has to dodge a real knife among fake ones in a stage play. It's the type of hugely theatrical scene that doesn't work at all in this type of film. Apart from that, the conclusion to the whole whodunnit isn't nearly as satisfying as Scream's.<br/><br/>What makes it worse is the rushed execution. Wes Craven is a gifted horror director and not a gifted stylist and Scream 2 brings out the worst in him. The entire film is shot in a dull, predictable fashion and at times it almost looks (cinematographically, anyway) random. Worse even is the handling of the typical horror film staples. The shocks are telegraphed early but don't work because of clumsy editing (the first 'shock' is a case in point). The gore level is very low (actually, apart from the sound effects there is nearly no real gore) and it doesn't have any atmosphere. Craven is talented, but here he's clearly rushed his work in order to release before the genre dies again.<br/><br/>And that's the whole film's problem, it feels too rushed. Which is also noticeable in the music, where they use part of the Broken Arrow soundtrack as Dewey's theme (or is this a VERY misguided popculture reference?). I really think with (a lot) more polishing Scream 2 could have a competent, enjoyable romp, but as is, it's only occasionally entertaining.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"

","""Scream"" reinvigorated the slasher movie, a narrow genre to begin with, and one that I thought exhausted.  It's sequel, ""Scream 2"" is very similar to its predecessor in substance and style. Strong character development, clever dialogue, large dollops of humor, and of course lots of scares marks this as way above average. Unfortunately, ""Scream 2"" has two significant difficulties for viewers. One is that it's almost a mirror image of ""Scream"". Instead of high school, it's set at a college, but the characters, and set-ups are almost identical. You don't have to see both movies, one is enough. The second problem is that if you haven't seen ""Scream"", ""Scream 2"" won't make a lot of sense. The plot follows the survivors of ""Scream"" to college, where, of course, the carnage begins anew. There are tons of backwards references that don't stand-alone very well, and as for the who-dunnit aspects of the movie's conclusion, knowledge of the original ""Scream"" is an absolute necessity.  Therefore, only rent ""Scream 2"" if you've also seen ""Scream"" and want more of the same. It's exactly what you'll get."

","Scream(1996) proved to be the major undoing of the Hollywood Horror film and Scream 2(1997) continues the trend of overrated and overbearing horror features in the USA.  This proves that most filmmakers in American today are clueless when it comes to making great horror films.  Scream 2(1997) begins on a good note but degenerates into a 2 hour repeat of the first film.  The opening scene in the movie theatre is a good homage to Lamberto Bava'a Demons(1985).  The acting overall is as lousy as the first film.  The movies of Dario Argento and Mario Bava may have had their share of flaws, but overall they almost always delievered something magnificent.<br/><br/>
The first two Scream movies would have been wise to spent less time having the murderers behaving like failed stand up comics and more time making them into scary figures.  Neve Campbell gives the only decent performance of the feature.  Its a pity that she has to again run from her attacker until she is put in a corner.  The success of Kevin Williamson as a Horror Screenwriter must be a sign of the times.  I do not believe that he would have the same success in the late 1960's to mid 1980's because people had higher standards for horror films then.<br/><br/>
Wes Craven has shown with his involvement in the Scream trilogy that he's a has been filmmaker.  At least movie makers like Dario Argento, George A. Romero, and David Cronenberg have not sold themselves out.  Scream 2(1997) plays its homage to the college theme slasher flicks of the early to mid 1980's.  It also rips off great Italian Giallos such as Torso(1973), Deep Red(1975), and Tenebre(1982).  If Tenebre's final fifteen minutes were breathtaking then the final fifteen minutes of Scream 2(1997) were horendous."

","While its not as good as the original, ""Scream 2"" is for the most part a very entertaining horror-comedy.

This time Campbell's character Sidney Prescott is away at college when murders start happening again. Cox (as Gale Weathers) and Arquette (as Dewey) arrive at the campus to find out what's going on and to try to find the killer (since the cops are no good in these movies). ""Scream 2"" isn't as good as the original because it's a little slow-moving at times which wasn't the case with the first film. Still, I was entertained for the most part, and the supporting cast of new actors do a good job. The only other actors to return from the original are Jamie Kennedy as nerdy Randy (the horror movie expert) and Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the man Campbell had put in jail for the murder of her mother but found out at the end of the first movie that he was innocent (Schreiber's part in the first movie was very brief; here he has a major supporting role). New cast members include Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer""), Jerry O'Connell (TV's ""Sliders""), Jada Pinkett (Mrs. Will Smith), and Laurie Metcalf (TV's ""Roseanne"").

","Well, I thought the first movie was great, but this one falls quite short of the mark.  Although this installment of the tragic life of Sydney Prescott has its moments (such as the great allusions to Greek literature), it has a relatively weak story.  Basically a dilapidated repeat of the first script, the movie relies on gore and ""startle shots"" rather than plot and suspense, two characteristics which made the original Scream stand out from other horror movies.  For instance, the killers (I won't reveal them here) end up being extremely minor and undeveloped characters whom the audience has not suspected at all in the first place.  In a good ""whodunit,"" the person watching should at first suspect the killer, and then be manipulated into dismissing this thought as too obvious.  The person should then flail about wildly suspecting everyone until the real killer is revealed, completely shocking them.  Instead, Scream 2 simply sells itself with more gore and throws in the most predictable killer.  For the killer's partner, Scream 2 chooses to nearly introduce an entirely new character.  Now, how is the audience supposed to suspect, be nervous about, and therefore terrified of a character they do not know in the first place?  With rumors of a third Scream surfacing, my advice to Wes Craven is this:  Quit while you are ahead, or rather, not too extremely far behind."

Listen when making a sequel try to bring something new to the genre instead off copy paste the first scream film that just what original, tense and scary, but now the second films seems more like a teenage comedy with stupid lines and over the top acting that just kills the entire movie. Its just a ripoff."

","The original Scream was quite clever in how it lambasted the clichés inherent in the horror genre while simultaneously turning those clichés upside down and delivering some fresh elements. But devoting multiple scenes to detailed discussion about how sequels are naturally inferior in a film that does nothing to assert the falsity of that argument? Not so clever.<br/><br/>Scream 2 is flawed on so many fronts, it's hard to know which ones to devote parts of my 1,000 word limitation to. I suppose it's best to start at the beginning, which in this film is devoted to a poorly executed and ultimately pointless exposition scene that makes no sense in the grand scheme of the film. Added to that is the lengthy diatribe Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps spar on that bemoans the lack of realistic African-American characters in horror films, which is delivered by characters that stringently adhere to the silliest and most annoying African-American stereotypes prevalent in cinema. Come to think of it, all of the characters of color in this film seem to embrace those same stereotypes, so in that context, the entire logic behind their spirited debate is more offensive than witty.<br/><br/>We also spend a great deal of time with Jamie Kennedy's returning horror buff Randy, who continues his nauseating analysis of the flaws in the horror genre, specifically his afore-mentioned philosophy on the tendency of sequels to regurgitate the more successful elements of their original animus with diminishing returns. This bit worked very well in the first Scream, which flaunted its own breaking of this mold, thus relegating Randy's soapbox testimonials to the realm of satire. But there is no satire to be found here, just a series of unfunny scenes that manage the seemingly impossibly feat of making Jamie Kennedy more annoying than we knew he was going in, and pad out an already too-long two-hour running time in the process.<br/><br/>Two sequences in particular dare the listener to stick with the film, which ultimately doesn't prove to be a wise decision when this entire mess plays out. Firstly, Jerry O'Connell's lunchroom serenade is such a sappy and idiotic number, any likability his character generates immediately evaporates. Watching the masses of students witnessing his stunt not only joining in the performance, but cheering wildly when he concludes the song and corners Sidney for a cringe-worthy PDA, makes us wonder which genre the film-makers are lampooning here. Hadn't these guys heard of ""deleted scenes"" before? Ditto for Sidney's meaningful discussion with her drama teacher about how artists channel their emotions into pathos in their performances, and the lengthy false-alarm scare that follows.<br/><br/>And, despite Jamie Kennedy's claim that sequels utilize more elaborate kills, nothing in this film comes close to matching Drew Barrymore's shocking exit from the first Scream, Rose MacGowan's ride on the garage door, or the grand guignol finale of the piece. In fact, the film is so tepid in this regard, we're left wondering why they bothered pointing out that they weren't supposed to be.<br/><br/>The wry humor has become a gimmick here, and though this film does indeed attempt to resurrect the strongest elements from the first Scream, this time out the horror is so banal that the humor dilutes the few true scares to be had. It's a shame too, since the unexpected cameos and humorous dramatizations of scenes from the first film are indeed refreshing and truly funny. But, the film-makers don't find the same balance they did before, so we're left wishing that they either toned down the humor or went the full-blown comedy route. This is far too lite to be a true horror film, but Ghosty's penchant for stabbing someone every 10 minutes will likely dissuade anyone from considering this a pure comedy.<br/><br/>The twist ending that we know is coming is dicey at best, and it was foolhardy of the film-makers to believe that casting incidental characters as our killers would have the same impact as the conclusion of the original. Like most of the elements in this film, we have to suspend our disbelief here so fully that we're never able to become engrossed in the mystery or suspense, what little there is.<br/><br/>And what super powers do our resilient returning characters have that allows one to be shot in the stomach and another to be eviscerated from behind, yet somehow survive their wounds without incident? The former even resurfaces in the final reel, walks off under their own power, and explains, ""I'm okay, the bullet just bounced off my ribcage""(?!). I'm not sure if this film takes place in an alternate universe future where medical science has advanced beyond our wildest dreams, but if this were the case, surely our killers should have been a bit harder to dispatch than the non-climax here would have us believe.<br/><br/>When you consider how disjointed and auto-piloted this film is, it's easy to imagine that the film-makers knew they were working on a trilogy, and were reluctant to use what few surprises they still had left until the final film (this is even more foolhardy now, when we know a fourth Scream entry is forthcoming). While they certainly ensured that Scream 3 wouldn't have a hard time out-doing its predecessor, they also effectively buried any chance of this being a classic SERIES of films, rather than one of the one-hit wonders frequently referenced throughout."

As with most horror movies, the killers don't follow any known psychcological profile of a serial killer.

Scream was good re-hash of some of those Friday The 13th rip-offs. It made around hundred and six million , not true blockbuster , but very profitable gain from its budget. Entertaining and Enthusiastic, but not as good as some of earlier horror movies like Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, Dead Alive, and Henry: Portrait of Serial Killer. Scream 2 was rehash of its orignal, the storyline is mediocre, but everything else just plain trash. This movie is tries to take every aspect of the first film and tries hard to re generate it.

I actually knew killers from start to finish without any spoilers. I'm dead serious!<br/><br/>There is a sequel that is about to begin production.

"Coventry","5","2","10","15 October 2009"," Lesser sequel, but at least they knew it and laughed about it.
","The undeniable best sequence in this film – as well as in all three ""Scream"" films, for that matter – involves the geeky horror connoisseur character Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) fanatically venting about his favorite, albeit cliché-laden genre. As this is a rapidly produced sequel to an unexpectedly successful horror blockbuster, Randy – with the help of an entire movie class - vividly rants how sequels never match up against the ingenuity and intellect of their predecessors. That scene alone is pretty clever already, in fact, because it feels as if director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson want to safeguard themselves against delivering a potentially inferior product. ""Scream 2"" isn't a bad film, especially not in comparison with the majority of horror junk that was coming out in the aftermath of the original ""Scream"", but indeed no match for the first. The screenplay actually does faithfully feature all the sequel clichés, like a higher death toll (particularly near the end, it seems like everybody must die) and a bloodier make-up effects. The film is also overlong and tries to be a little too clever in all its 90's pop-culture observations. Good aspects, however, include the successful change of location from a typical small town towards a university campus. Both settings are typical 80's horror fare settings. The survivors of the original film have obviously grown in their roles and the production managed to attract some interesting fresh new faces for the principal roles (like Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar) as well as some cool cameos (like David Warner, Heather Graham and Luke Wilson). The plot of the sequel is as simplistic and rudimentary as that of the original. Sidney Prescott and her friend Randy are trying to carry on with their lives two years after the Woodsboro murders. When a young couple gets killed during the premiere of ""Stab"" – a horror flick based on the Woodsboro murders – it quickly becomes clear there's a copycat killer after Sidney. Despite some really good ideas and a few moments of admirable suspense (the escape from the crashed car, for example), ""Scream 2"" is a repetitive and forgettable film."

","After Scream respectfully made fun of the slasher sub-genre, this sequel was done. In addition to more satire and clever jabs at the films, from the very first scene, this also has some material on sequels in the genre. An obvious choice, yes, but why not? Such would not have worked in the first film, for self-explanatory reasons, and while it may not all be of quite as high quality as that of the film preceding this, there are still points made. The plot is fairly good, but the reveal at the end is just not as effective as the one of the first(which, going by the Trivia, can be attributed to the original script leaking... thanks, guys, *now* will ya just let them make the movies in peace?). There are suspenseful and tense scenes in this, as well, and, as the sequel rules dictate(and as is said out loud within the film), this is bigger than the first. There's more blood and gore(though I'm not sure the death scenes are necessarily better than, or even match, the ones of the original). The characters are reasonably well-done, if the new ones aren't as interesting as those of the first. At least one character of the first gets more of a role. This picks up nicely from the first(not *right* where it left off), and should definitely not be watched prior to watching the first. If you have, however, watched Scream and want more of the same, this'll do nicely. It isn't quite as good, but it is worth watching. Score, music and sound is well-done. This has some good scares, too. I recommend this to any fan of the first, horror and/or respectful parodies of said genre, specifically earlier-mentioned sub-genre. 7/10"

Second, WHY would a horror film based on real murders allow masks and fake knives inside the theater ? It's common sense. I just find it too unrealistic and cheesy. You don't put people in danger by handing out killer's masks, making it way too easy for actual murders and/or dangerous activity to take place.

"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","5","21 April 2011"," Typical sequel but still good enough all.
","To be fair, as far as slasher movies go, this is still one of the better ones to watch out there. When compared to the first ""Scream"" movie it isn't nearly as good but when judged on its own, it's a quite good and enjoyable genre movie.<br/><br/>There are more than a few reasons why this movie is inferior to its predecessor, that got released only a year before this movie did. First and foremost, it is because it's all not as fresh anymore of course as the first movie still was. The first movie redefined the genre and really brought the slasher genre back again. What does this sequel do? More of the same really, only worse and less original.<br/><br/>So the story is definitely less fresh and less original this time, which also makes the movie a bit ineffective at times. I still like the beginning of this movie very much and probably more than the the opening sequence of the first original movie but after that the movie runs out of steam and good ideas pretty fast. It doesn't always manage to build up its tension well, which is probably because it's too self aware of its self as well. The first movie more or less poked fun at the genre and all of its rules but this one takes itself even less serious. This really goes at the expense of all of its tension.<br/><br/>The movie also definitely starts to loose it more toward its end. It's final 20 minutes or so just aren't much good or interesting as a climax, mostly because the killer(s) gets revealed after that point but its identity and motivation aren't exactly being the most convincing or cleverly written and very forgettable to be honest. I had seen this movie in the past, even more than once I believe but I really didn't membered who the killer(s) was in this movie.<br/><br/>But like mentioned before, as a genre movie this still remains a perfectly good and watchable one. It's a whodunit slasher, with plenty of good characters and also still some good killings. Ghostface also remains a perfect evil killer for this type of movie and it of course doesn't matter who the killer behind the mask is really for the Ghostface killer to simply keep doing his thing.<br/><br/>It's also quite amazing to see how many great well known actors appeared in Scream movies, before their big breakthrough as well known stars. That goes for this movie more than any other one out of the series perhaps. Liev Schreiber's role gets really expanded this time and the movie also stars newcomers Timothy Olyphant and Jerry O'Connell, among many others.<br/><br/>But what's also a strength of these movies is that it manages to keep most of its crew but also cast together for all of its movies. Basically everyone that survived the first movie returns in this one and play an important role once more. I guess it's not entirely necessary but it still is what makes the series consistently fun and also makes it distinct itself from other long running horror movie series.<br/><br/>Don't expect the first movie and you'll still have a good time with this one.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","10","11 April 2011"," Highly Entertaining Sequel
","Scream 2 (1997) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Two years after the events in the previous film, a movie named ""Stab"", based on those events, is about to be released and sure enough Sidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends find themselves being stalked by a new ghost face killer. SCREAM worked so well because it knew it was a horror movie, knew the clichÃ©s and knew how to have fun with it. There's no question this sequel was made to cash-in on the success of the first film but thankfully screenwriter Kevin Williamson also knows this and keeps the fun going. There's a terrific sequence early in the film where some film students discuss the good and bad to sequels and we've got Randy (Jamie Kennedy) giving us the rules to survive a sequel. This all adds up to a winning film even if it falls somewhat short of the original. Williamson's screenplay certain makes the mystery deeper and adds some higher quality death scenes but perhaps one of the most interesting aspects doesn't get covered as funny as it could have been. I think the movie would have been better had they toned down some of the culture references and instead took a closer look at violence in movies and how it might relate to violence in the real world. This is touch on briefly and even is motivation for one of the killers. Those who were old enough to remember when this film was in the theater will remember some copycat killers of the first film so it's clear that both the screenwriter and director are stating their opinion that you can't blame movies. It's just too bad this wasn't explored a little bit more. As with the first film, the cast hit all the right marks with Campbell perfect as the victim and and we also get fine performances from Liev Schreiber and Kennedy. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a cameo appearance but it's David Arquette and Courteney Cox who easily steal the film as Dewey and Gale Weathers. The two of them had remarkable chemistry in the film film and that carries over here as their playful banter just adds to the fun. The death scenes here are more violent than in the first film but they'll all well handled by Craven who certainly hasn't forgotten how to stage a scene. The highlight of the film is a sequence where Sidney and her friend are trapped in the back of a police car with the killer in the front seat passed out. The two girls have to try and crawl over him to freedom and this here is Craven at his very best as he milks the scene for every inch of suspense. I think the identity of the killer isn't as good as in the first film because there doesn't seem to be much intent on the ""mystery"" being a big aspect here. Of course they don't want you to figure out but when the killer or killers are finally revealed you realize there wasn't much rhyme or reason and that they could have picked anyone. While SCREAM 2 isn't a masterpiece it is rare as sequels usually aren't that good. This certainly isn't as good as the original but it's a good way to continue the story."

By being self aware, many believe the Scream franchise to be a smart retelling of what would happen in real life, but really, as smart as this concept could be, it seems held back by its own hypocritical antics, and this film is especially no exception. Filled with stereotypes and cliches galore, the film feels like one eye roll after another, and eventually you just give up on believing it will truly make any impact, or for that matter, any sense at all. The actors give it their best shot, but with a screenplay that seems to stubborn to life the veil on what it could be, it hardly gives them any grace for it. The film is shot well, but as obvious as it is, looking good and being good are two very different things, especially when it comes to film.

The gore factor isn't as much present as it was in the first one, but it's still very much there, so just be aware that that's there, in case you're someone who gets squeamish easily or just hates seeing blood.

I always enjoy Wes Craven's films and after accepting the 1st one I bought this one on VHS and watched it. Well I immediately knew who the killer was because I noticed while Derek is at the hospital the character of Mickey was grinning as he talked to Sidney and he basically was protecting the killer by saying, ""He just needs to know that now is not the time to play hero."" Another thing that caused me to suspect him was that he was one of only a couple new male characters. In slasher films it's mostly male killers. He also didn't even really have any scenes where he was with the group members. I also knew it couldn't of been any of the survivors because hey why would they want to hurt Sidney?

","I know my statement that ""Scream 2"" is better than the first ""Scream"" isn't a new one, but I have to jump on the bandwagon here because that is indeed the case. ""Scream 2"" is not only better than the original, it's one of the best horror sequels I've seen and the best self- aware movie I've ever watched. While the later films in the ""Scream"" franchise and the abominable ""22 Jump Street"" fail at the sequel self-awareness, ""Scream 2"" succeeds creating an enjoying, scary, and entertaining second installment to a franchise. <br/><br/>Opening up in a movie theater at the premiere of the film Stab, a movie based on the events of the first film, two college students (Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps) are brutally killed by someone dressed in the same costume as the original killer. The two college students just so happen to attend the same college as Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the main character of the first film. Along with Sidney are several characters returning from the previous film including her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy), police deputy Dewey (David Arquette), and ruthless news reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox). Also appearing as either victims or suspects are Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), her friends Hallie (Elise Neal) and Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), and the man that Sidney wrongly convicted of murdering her mother, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber).<br/><br/>While self-awareness is something I usually hate in movies because I think it makes them hypocritical, ""Scream 2"" does it right. For one thing the movie doesn't use self-awareness to cover for itself because it's a sequel. Along with that, though, the movie has a few clever inclusions to it to make it look like a typical sequel. A lot of the time, sequels are just the original redone in a different way. With the inclusion of people watching scenes from Stab, the audience is literally re-watching the same movie as the first one. Another example is Gale's cameraman Joel (Duane Martin) knows that to survive he has to get away before anything happens. He leaves the film half-way through, only to return at the end, unharmed and thus surviving the movie. The only time the self-awareness comes off as hypocritical is when a sorority girl named Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar) hears a noise and starts searching the house after she already had the bright idea to leave it.<br/><br/>One thing the movie did was develop the characters more. In the first movie, Gale and Dewey are hinted at having some sort of interest in each other, but it's not anything important. In the second film, they expand on that idea to give them a deeper connection. The movie also displays the effects of the first film weighing heavily on Sidney, with minor things like slight differences in her characters actions and way of thinking to more extreme things with her not fully trusting Derek because of her boyfriend from the first movie's inclusion in the murder spree.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot of scary and suspenseful moments, the best being when Sidney is rehearsing the play she's in and with all of the effects and extras dancing around on stage with fake weapons and creepy masks, she either sees or imagines the killer running around on stage trying to get her. This movie also carries on the use of elaborate red herrings that the first movie used, making you think it could be anyone. And while this movie does do that, the knowledge that this movie is a sequel makes you wonder whether or not they're going the same route or not.<br/><br/>""Scream 2"" is a well thought out self-aware horror film with a lot of attention placed into the atmosphere of the movie. The movie is aware that it's a sequel and that sequels are usually inferior to the original, but the people behind the movie worked to make it better. They did more with the characters, they didn't hit rewind with the story, they let the events from the first film actually effect the story, and made a suspenseful, scary movie all at the same time."

","Two years after the first movie. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a book about the murders and it's been popularized in the movie Stab. A new Ghostface rises up to start killing again at a showing of Stab. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) is out of prison with the help of Gale. Gale is too happy to soak up all the publicity. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are students at Windsor College. Derek (Jerry O'Connell) is Sidney's new boyfriend. Dewey Riley (David Arquette) comes out to protect Sidney. There is a whole new cast of characters ready for the killing and ready to be suspects.<br/><br/>Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson have return to the self-referencing franchise. Being a sequel, there are a lot of referencing to sequels and what that usually entails. It gives the franchise a new reason to continue. The returning cast is a capable crew. I do have a minor problem with the new additions. They all end up as either cannon fodder or the killers. It would be much more surprising if one of the new people survives."

","While I will give SCREAM 2 (1998) credit for it's great opening with (uncredited?) Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett, it's definitely not as good as it's predecessor (the groundbreaking Scream from 1996 that re-generated the horror genre). To repeat, the opening to Scream 2 is cool with that wonderful dialogue between Epps and Pinkett and the similar tongue-in-cheek approach that opened 1.<br/><br/>Scream 2 again stars engaging Neve Campbell as eternal victim Sydney Prescott. Campbell still brings it as the centerpiece of the story. Also back from 1 are David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Courtney Cox as Anchorwoman Gail Weathers as well as Jamie Kennedy as Randy, all survivors of the bloodbath from 1.<br/><br/>The action in 2 shifts to college as Sydney and Randy are attending a local university. The main cast from part 1 to part 2 seems to be multiplied by 4! Added to the mix is an eclectic group of familiar young actors (Jerry O'Connell, Elise Neal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Duane Martin, etc.!). I think this is part of the problem as the film is an uneasy mix of the main actors from 1 along with all these new faces in 2. There's too much exposition as half of Scream 2 spends time referring back to 1.<br/><br/>There seems to be too much going on in Scream 2 and most of it is pretty boring. The dialogue and scenes leading up to the big kill moments have no wit, bite or humor like in the first movie. Characters pop in and out of nowhere adding nothing to the proceedings. And certainly the ending isn't nearly as sharp, surprising, or suspenseful as in Part 1.<br/><br/>The main problem with 2 is that it really is just a standard horror movie, while 1 was more ingenious in it's homage to slasher flicks."

","Wes Craven is back with Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy for the sequel of slasher spoof 'Scream'. This time the film pokes fun at the slasher sequels where the twists and turns are more absurd and silly and with more deathcounts. The team does a successful job and just like in the first movie the element of suspense and humour is fused together very well. The new cast includes Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liev Schreiber (who did have a smaller role in the first movie), Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olifant, Laurie Metcalf, Marisol Nichols, Portia de Rossi and Rebecca Gayheart and they contribute well. The latter two are particularly hilarious as they parody sorority sluts. Now I won't reveal which ones get butchered and which ones survive for that is best left to the viewer but Craven and his team have succeeded yet again in parodying the subgenre. Some may argue that it is less clever compared to the first but that's the point because sequels usually are sillier than their predecessors and the final revelation here is hilarious. On the technical side, music is effectively used and the camera-work does its trick. The sets are also quite impressive, particularly in the theatre scene. <br/><br/>It's silly alright but thankfully not as far-fetched as in the fourth movie. Let's see what the third one has in store."

However, the production values are of high quality, the music is still haunting and the sound still unsettling, there are still the funny lines, the genuine scares, the credible direction from Wes Craven and the return of the iconic GhostFace.

"kluseba","6","0","1","27 April 2011"," The best part of the series convinces with more focus on the best characters and a sinister atmosphere
","After a rather superficial first part, the second movie of the Scream series has been a step forward. The scarface killer is more intelligent, more brutal and more mysterious and a couple of surprises keep you hanging on until the end of the movie. The second part also focuses more on some of the stronger characters of the first part such as the intriguing and wrongfully suspected Cotton Weary, the journalist Gale Weathers that shows some unknown emotional sides beyond her facades of a seemingly egoist personality and the police deputy Dewey Riley that turns out to be much more clever and courageous than it seemed in the first part where he got completely dumped.<br/><br/>On a negative side, the opening scene in the cinema shows already the main fan base of the first movie and one realizes that the main concept didn't change as the movie desperately tries to parody its predecessor, to include some stereotypical citations of classic horror movies and to introduce some new stupid teenage characters. The final conclusion to this movie is even more stupid as the ending of the first part and somewhat lacks of originality. That means that you still have to switch your brain off and look over details concerning annoying characters, horrible dialogues or lacks of originality in the script.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has still more suspense than the first part, concentrates on better actors and has a higher degree of dark atmosphere. It's a gripping flick that concentrates as much on the entertaining and humorous side of the movie as on the mystery and horror factor. I would say that this movie is easily the best part of the series until now but it can't mess with the classics of the suspense or horror genre."
"timesplitterz","7","0","1","18 April 2011"," not a worthy sequel but not a bad film
","Scream 2 is an odd film to say the least, it in no way lives up to the first film but is not a completely terrible film. After watching this film recently (having not seen it in several years) I was left feeling confused about the movie. <br/><br/>Having Sid at college is a great settling for a slasher film, it has creepy corridors, college parties, loads of suspects and much more elements that could be used, but the film doesn't seem to utilises them well enough.<br/><br/>The film didn't have the same sort of scares that the first film included, the scare scenes in this film just don't feel as they did in the first. The movie also fails on doing what made the first film so brilliant which was the nod to previous slashers and horror movies, it became less of a parody and more of the many films the original Scream was poking fun at. <br/><br/>However saying all this the film still has its up sides, there are some great scenes within the film and some of them are quite remember able. I personally felt that in some of the cool scenes there is much room for improvement and that they could of done so much with them. It does have its moments and there is one scene that is sort of moving in its own way but not much more then that. <br/><br/>Scream 2 is good if your looking to put something on with a couple of mates thats fun and has its jumpy moments as well but thats all it is while the first one was fun to watch with friends but was really cleaver. <br/><br/>In conclusion Scream 2 isn't the best of Scream films but it includes some great moments and as always unpredictable Killer/Killers."

At least it was the factor that I enjoyed in the first ""Scream"" movie with it's horror movie rules and such. And was one of the reason why it stood out from being just another generic slasher flick. However this time it's less clever from the previous movie, not that the previous ""Scream"" was all that clever and this time it's way more silly. Like one of the quote from this movie ""sequels suck"" ""they are inferior films"" I wouldn't say this movie sucked, but it's inferior to the first ""Scream"". But I really liked how this makes references to the first ""Scream"" movie, it's the most intriguing part of this movie. And although it's inferior, it's still a satisfying sequel. There is more body counts this time around, but that doesn't necessarily a good thing for slasher flicks all the time. This film although puts more emphasis on who's the killer aspect, but it just isn't that engaging for the audience. What I found really absurd about this movie is how, although the scenarios for the killer is coincidental it always goes according to the way the killer wants it to.

","The first Scream gave an entire new generation of Horror fans a brilliant series. It only stood to reason they would rush to make a sequel a year later. The amazing part is that Scream 2, in most people's opinions easily sits on the plateau of the original and in some ways even exceeds the original film. The story is stronger, the cast is thoroughly established, and they are in a whole new setting ripe for the Ghostface killer. The film makers are incredibly smart because they stuck to the 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' method by keeping everything that made the original Scream successful and top notch. Best of all they took the incredibly clever satire that made the first one a huge success and turned up the intelligent and fun horror spoofing. The two films together make probably one of the best slasher flicks in the nineties easily. If anything director Wes Craven knew exactly how to keep the success rolling and that makes anyone who loves horror smile because it means you will be ferociously entertained and blown away by something that is smarter and truly a pop culture revolution.<br/><br/>The entire original main cast come back stronger than ever. Neve Campbell, Liev Schreiber (really terrific and his character is even better), Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Jamie Kennedy all come back and are truly better than they were the first time around. Their characters are more developed, we know their background and what they've been through and their older and in a new place in their lives. Schreiber and Kennedy are both better than they were the first time around and more main character. As in the first film Scream 2 gives us a host of hot young newcomers and Hollywood 'It' kids including Jada Pinkett Smith (classic beginning horror scene that she is great in), Omar Epps (same for him), Sarah Michelle Gellar, Joshua Jackson, Timothy Olyphant, Rebecca Gayheart, and Portia de Rossi. Also new to the cast is Sydney's (Campbell) new boyfriend Jerry O'Connell who is really great as one of the male heroes in the film. Him and Campbell have great chemistry as well.<br/><br/>There is no question that Wes Craven is a horror master but Scream proved his direction was timeless. He returns to helm the perfect (and superior) sequel and Kevin Williamson returns to pen the script. The setting of the college campus and sorority house would seem to be terribly predictable and yet Scream 2 pulls off their clever satire and poke fun at the horror genre and itself at the same time and at a whole new level even above the original. Unlike other slasher flicks Scream has always been known for revealing the killer in the end and the story and twist at the end fits everything into a neat little package (unlike Scream 3.) Regardless any horror fans needs to see the entire trilogy especially with a fourth installment on the way, but Scream will give you a whole new perspective on slasher flicks, Scream 2 will demonstrate the sequel to a slasher flick exceeding even its original.

"jzappa","8","0","1","20 May 2010"," Blame the Media!
","Scream was a cutting-edge film, the first horror movie in which the characters had seen other horror movies, knew all the conventions, and didn't make the barefaced boo-boos without letting us know that's what they were. In Scream 2, the characters have seen a movie about the first killings, and are caught once again in a slasher fantasy. Like all sequels, this one is a see-through endeavor to cash in on the original, but, naturally, it knows it is, and features its own educated discourse on sequels. The finding is that a mere handful of sequels have been as good as the originals; the characters particularly like Aliens and The Godfather Part II. As for Scream 2, it's, well, about as good as the original. Both movies use a narrative contraption for making the audience flinch and gasp and grasp their pillows. The shocks this time come from a mad slasher in an oddly unsettling Halloween ghost mask, who ambushes a slew of college freshmen who lived through the initial murders. The killer is also concerned with such hangers-on as a TV newsman and a physically and emotionally wounded former deputy sheriff.<br/><br/>Kevin Williamson's basis this time is that violence is swiftly rendered into commercial ritual by the media: Because he is doing that very thing in Scream 2, there are paradoxes within paradoxes here. The movie is so expressive about what it's doing, in fact, that you can't knock it on that basis because it gets there first. Do movies prompt people to commit violent acts? Scream 2 seemed to think so, or is that a mocking position, to make the movie more effective? Have movies like this, by enlightening its audience to the traditions and ridiculous banalities of horror films, pacified their violence and make them less apt to be persuaded by the violence? Now there's an interesting thought.<br/><br/>The movie's brilliant beginning sequence involves a theatrical premiere of Stab, a movie based on the killings in the first film, and at the screening two audience members are, well, see for yourself. Soon the slasher has moved to a neighboring campus, where survivors including Sidney Prescott are students, and the wounded Deputy Riley has found a job as a security guard. Also loitering is TV newswoman Gale Weathers, who---this is priceless satire---covered the first murders and wrote a best-seller about them that became ""Stab"" and has thus influenced the new murders. Also brooding around is Cotton, accused by Gale in the first film but found innocent, and now urging a second helping of his 15 minutes of fame. There is no way to predict the identity of the killer, and everyone who acts leery is (almost) certain to be innocent.<br/><br/>The Williamson screenplay employs the horror scaffold as a rocket platform for considerable parody. I'd like to have seen him work on a more serious film. When Courteney Cox, playing the TV newswoman, is asked about her nude photos on the Internet, she replies, ""It was just my head. It was Jennifer Aniston's body."" And a killer says he wants to be caught, because he's already determined his plan of action: ""The movies made me do it,"" he'll proclaim, and he plans to have Bob Dole as a witness for the defense. ""I'll get Cochran!"" he boasts. ""The Christian Coalition will pay for my defense!"" Wes Craven was made to direct the Scream films. One of the most productive of horror filmmakers, he made The Hills Have Eyes and the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and was already headed in the same metatextual trajectory as Williamson when he wrote and directed Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994, which took his own series' blurring of reality and nightmares to a new extreme, Freddy crossing over to attack the filmmakers in the ""real"" world. There's a difference here in the Scream movies where an all-new slasher killer causes the post-modern irony to be more disguised, and what might be the most ironic thing about these ever more ironic movies is that it resuscitated the entire genre. Spawning countless imitations, the joke is on them!"

","Scream 2 came hot on the heels of the original, with Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson signing on again to direct and write and all of the surviving original cast returning. And they are able to churn out a movie almost as good as its predecessor. While lacking the unique feel of the original, this movie picks up the ball and runs with it, crafting an entertaining film from the still fresh approach used in the original.<br/><br/>The story here is that Gale Weathers has written a best selling book about the events of the first film, which has itself been turned into a film ""Stab"" (starring Tori Spelling in a nice little reference to a throwaway line of dialogue from the original). Sidney is now at College with a new boyfriend (played by Jerry ""Kangaroo Jack"" O'Connell) trying to move on with her life, but of course, it all starts to happen again. Two students from Sidney's College are found murdered at the ""Stab"" premier. She herself is attacked and she finds herself living once again in a real life horror film where everyone's a suspect.<br/><br/>Scream 2 does have some welcome additions to the cast, with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett signing up to be slaughtered, and Timophy Olyphant showing some early promise as Mickey, the freaky Tarantino film student. Liev Schrieber's extended role is another nice addition.<br/><br/>The script tends to be more an in joke on the original film rather than the horror genre, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had. The kills are more elaborate than in the original, which has the downside of also making them more absurd. Omar Epps death in particular bends logic.<br/><br/>Overall though, while not as good as the original, Scream 2 is still far more entertaining than many movies that came out in the same period and is far from a bad way to spend two hours. Well worth a look."

It's not the same when you speak about Kevin's writing. Scream 2 nearly out shines it's predecessor. Reprisals from the main actors really helped.<br/><br/>There was still an incredible amount of suspense and mystery, and still gave the same vibe that Scream does about ""who killed who?"" I enjoyed every minute of the film and I found the character development endearing. No cheating and cheap shots involved in this sequel. It's true and loyal to it's fans.<br/><br/>Horror fans will still have their heart pounding and blood turned to ice as it's just as scary as the original. Hardly any comedy doesn't help with calming the mind after a big scare scene either. But, comedic relief is not necessary.<br/><br/>It still remains a satire film in making fun of the genre and of itself. It's fun to watch and very re-watchable.

","Wrongly imprisoned and almost executed for the murder of town bike Maureen Prescott, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) could be forgiven for being a little bitter towards young Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose false testimony resulted in his incarceration. But is the recently released Weary responsible for the spate of copycat killings taking place at Sidney's college? With so many candidates for campus maniac to choose from, it's anyone's guess...<br/><br/>Scream 2 is definitely a case of 'more of the same', but when 'the same' is of such a high calibre, this really isn't much of an an issue: the film is still an absolute blast and a worthy successor to the brilliant original.<br/><br/>This time around, writer Kevin Williamson abides by most of the rules of the horror sequel, as defined by the film's very own movie nerd Randy: the body count is bigger and the death scenes are more elaborate, and definitely messier. Fortunately, Williamson doesn't stick to the notion that sequels have to be inferior: the superbly constructed script, masterful direction from Wes Craven and great performances from an excellent cast (several of whom reprise their roles from the first film) ensure that Scream 2 works like a charm, providing fans with another satisfying dose of fear laced with laughter.<br/><br/>In addition to the expected scenes of stalk and slash, the well executed jump scares, and the usual quota of red herrings, there are in-jokes aplenty for film buffs to spot, and umpteen 'guest' stars who pop up in blink-and-you'll-miss-'em bit parts (familiar faces include Heather Graham, Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson, Portia de Rossi, and Jada Pinkett, plus Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart and Joshua Jackson, who would subsequently appear in Scream-alike slashers I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend).<br/><br/>If you loved the first Scream, then the chances are you'll have loads of fun with this one too."

","When 'Scream 2' came out, now more than a decade ago, I loved it. In fact, it landed on my top 10 superior (or equal to) sequels to the originals. Now, watching the trilogy complete, it's not as good as I remembered it. Sure it has a lot of good points: Courtney and Neve look great! The tongue-in-cheek sequel jokes/statements are great. I always love Olyphant, Pinkett, Jackson and Gellar. And they really up'd the ante on making the now-familiar ""whodunit"" storyline a little more mysterious. Unfortunately, the bad way outweighs the good. Though, I loved the creativity, dialogue and theme to the opening, it was just plain way too drawn out and pointless to the remainder of the movie. (I see how they matched the first movie's intro, but at least that was more scary and interesting, overall.) The rest of the movie follows suit – it's way longer than it needed to be, so much could've been cut. And the coincidences/plot holes were pretty thick. It's years later, they've made a movie(-within a movie, 'Stab') which apparently sparks another blood bath for anyone who hangs out with the survivors from part one. I don't want to sound too harsh; I enjoyed this feature, it has a lot of creativity to it and it's worth watching. It has some intense scenes – my favorite is the courtyard search, but coincidentally it saddens me that my favorite character is off'd during this scene. I can't spoil too much, but the closing (another long and drawn out scene) had me rolling my eyes. As did that horrible 'Top Gun' homage. I am not at all a fan of Jerry O'Connell and definitively not one of the worst actors: Liev Schreiber, and he didn't do much to change that here. Still worth a view."

","Aside from all the great jokes (even better than the first), Scream 2 does nothing else right. It is clear from all the self-reflective comedy that Wes Craven is desperate to show that his series his more than bloody, perverted and gimmicky horror. Ironically, Scream 2 makes the same mistake as every other horror sequel which can be labeled gimmick, it copies the first. Not only is Scream 2 less scary but it is frequently laughable. Watching our killer chasing his shrieking victims wielding the knife resembles a Scooby-Doo chase, totally unscary. Just as it was in the first, the climax is the dumbest part of the film. Not only that, but some of is a direct rip- off of one of the great horror classics, I won't tell you which one, but I'll give you a hint (angry mama). Despite potential, there are no screams to be had here, but if you liked the first, then I guess you will like this one too."

","I was never that much of a fan of the original Scream. Don't get me wrong, I did have fun watching it. But, like this sequel, it was very overrated, and it spawned some really bad imposters (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend). But, the main problem I had with Scream was the killer GhostFace. There was nothing interesting about him/her (I'm not mentioning scary because there have only been two horror movies that have scared me. And I have had to have seen around 1,000 horror movies by now). He/she was just dull, repetitive, and annoying as hell! I just couldn't stand him/her! And this all came back to haunt me in Scream 2. GhostFace is more dull, repetitive, and annoying, and the movie had more plot holes than swiss cheese (I'll regret ever using that bad insult)! Like mentioned in the summary, this movie needed a re-write (and a more intriguing killer too). Scream 2 is also very low on gore and action, and the only excitement I had was in my pants when Neve Campbell was on screen. The only thing that I enjoyed was the ending. *SPOILERS* Sure, I didn't like the mother bit returning for revenge after her loss of her son (who was the killer and the original), and Mr. Double Duty could've been left out, because it was basically repeating what happened in the first Scream. But, I'll be damned if I wouldn't say that the action at the end wasn't exciting. We had gun shots, blood wounds, and more cheap shots than Joan Rivers on Oscar night (and the end credits had me excited, since it meant the dreadful movie was over).*END OF SPOILERS* This was just a cash-in to the first Scream.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars"

","""Scream 2"" pulls off the seemingly impossible task of outdoing the original. With the murders in her hometown now behind her, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now in college. Only the murders aren't over; someone is coming after her and in the process, pulling off murders as they appear in sequels. The rules are: the body count is always higher, and the death scenes are more elaborate. And I gotta say, I didn't see that ending coming.<br/><br/>I should warn you that there is a scene in this movie that will probably make you jump. You'll know it when you see it (or more accurately, when you jump). Campbell does a great job, as do Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber, and the rest of the cast. And of course, Wes Craven affirms his status as one of America's great directors."
"TruPretender","5","0","2","25 October 2005"," ...2, the ""Back For More"" movie.
","...And the audience was desperate for a sequel! Yep, the inevitable was near, so near it was a only a single year after the original ""Scream"" that we saw a continuation of the Wes Craven movie that spawned a huge following. This film did nothing more than take the first film to a new and alleged stereotypical setting that would be ground zero for another slasher story. I can say, however, that this film was, in event, actually better than its procedure. I guess most sequels sometimes feel more intriguing than the originals, but only to an extent. The feeling is usually only a left-over sentiment from the original winning a fans heart. In ""Scream 2"", there is both, a sentiment, and excitement that runs along the entire film. Better yet, the first film may as well not even exist, seeing as Kevin Williamson made quite sure that any pre-requisite films need not apply this time around. You hear so much about the first one, why even bother watching? All you get is twice the gore, twice the cheese, and all that goofy Williamson dialog, fit with cheap so-called innovation.<br/><br/>This time, we have a new movie opening up appropriately titled 'Stab'. A hot'n'happening college couple are out on a date to inspect it, or rather, he is, she should be back in the dorm studying. At any rate, trouble ensues when the culture-oriented colleagues become the hot topic of the following morning news.Yes, a second killer is here, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) cannot help but feel that somehow, it is all her fault. If this is incorrect, than Campbell gives off the wrong signals all throughout the film. Anyway, the public media creates a frenzy at a nice little college where Campbell and Kennedy from the first, now reside. Guess who else in back...Gale Weathers! Yes, the convenient 'Stab' franchise is based on none other, than the ""Scream"" original caper itself! How Very! (or not!). David Arguette also comes back as the laid-back, humble cop Dewey. We get to see more of Kennedys' rambling about supposed pop- culture sequels such as ""Aliens"" . We also receive information about slasher movies located at a college campus. We learn of ""House On Sorority Row"", ""The Dorm that Dripped Blood"", even a little bit about ""Showgirls"". How fun! In any case, blood baths return, as well as more predictability and that 'lingo' issue Williamson had with the first one.<br/><br/>Arquette, Campbell, and Cox are well on target, keeping their characters up to par with the original formality they began with. Kennedys ""Randy"" is more intellectual, and given the treatment of a saint...and for what? All he does is sit side and give his own commentary about sequels and trilogies. How original...right! Perhaps if he was not such a film geek before... Other cast members are fun to watch. Jerry O'Connel, Timothy Olephant, and Rebecca Gayheart are nice and steady. A real joker about this, is the disgustingly goofy way that Sarah Michelle Gellar has a bit part as a typical sorority girl on campus. Please...it was enough in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" also written by Williamson, but I remember finding out she was in this after ""Summer"" and thinking it was pretty ridiculous. There is, however, a performance that stands out major from the rest of the cast, and the award for best actor/actress in this installment goes to Laurie Metcalf, for a great comeback into film, as well as all the little manifestations she creates.<br/><br/>The writing is slightly better than the original, and obviously so, as the first one was the starting point for all this madness and violence. The issue of extreme language and convenient movie knowledge still present, only this time, we have a full classroom of film studies, where everyone is just like Kennedys' ""Randy"". Williamson is too enthralled to slow the pace, and thusly the story is quick and sharp, if sometimes repetitive and lacking. I suppose it is likely that Williamson reached a certain status of narcissism with the success of the first film. It is all too fake by the end. Some of the dialog is just as hammy as Thanksgiving dinner. Albeit entertaining.<br/><br/>Wes Craven gives his usual storytelling in genius fashion, but the impact on pop-culture is still all to shocking to believe. We still have the same direction as the first, with no real end of the tunnel. New back stories and twists may come off as new direction for the story,but for the most part, it just says the same old thing over and over again. Maybe by ""Scream 3""..."

The film starts with another Scary opener and its with Jada Pinkett and her boyfriend waiting to see ""Stab"", its a movie based on the murders that happened in Woodsboro a year earlier, but not much to their knowledge their life will be a scary movie in the movie theatre, In the film ""Stab"" they are watching Heather Graham is re acting Drew Barrymores performance as Casey Becker. Jada is playing Maureen Evans a bright young Women and hates scary movies. after her boyfriend is killed hes after her but the audience think thats its a funny stunt, but it turns out not to be funny at all when she dies in front of 200 people. When than see a familiar face Sidney Prescott, shes now at college with her new best friend Hallie played by Elise Neal and now Sid discovers its happening all over again. We than get introduced to Sidneys new Boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O Connel and too Woodsboro survivors Dewey and Randy. suddenly out of no where Courtney Cox is back as Gail Weathers and she brought along Cotten Weary because she wants Sidney to talk about what happened the year before, Sid is not happy and walks away.

","Scream 2 starts with the premiere of the horror film 'Stab'. Stab is a film based upon the events of the first Scream (1996), a young couple named Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett Smith as Jada Pinkett) & Phil Stevens (Omar Epps) attend the showing where both are brutally murdered by an unknown masked assailant. The murders are widely reported & it's not long before Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) becomes aware of the fatalities. Chief Lewis Hartly (Lewis Arquette) tries to calm the press who include Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) complete with new cameraman Joel Jones (Duane Martin) once again back trying to break a huge story & thus find fame & fortune. Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette) also shows up out of concern for Sidney, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) who survived the events of the original Scream is still around & to make things even more like old times Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) turns up who just happens to have spent the last year of his life in jail after he was wrongly accused by Sidney. Sidney's roommate Hallie McDaniel (Elise Neal) tries to cheer her up by taking Sidney to a party that very night, unfortunately Cici Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has to stay behind on her own & becomes the next victim. As the bodies pile up so do the suspects & once again Sidney must unmask the killer or pay the ultimate price...<br/><br/>Directed by Wes Craven like the original who also has a small blink & you'll miss him cameo I thought Scream 2 was good solid entertaining fun & a worthy sequel. The script again by Kevin Williamson who also has a small cameo doesn't stray too far from the original's roots in terms of tone & feel, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Everything you expect is here, the self parody, the witty one liners, making fun of the slasher clichés & genre all done with a nice affection & considerable humour, there is a nice running gag about film sequels, their rules & the fact that their always inferior. Scream 2 moves along at a nice pace even if it could have done with a couple more murders & a few scenes maybe should have been cut or shortened because at 2 hours my interest started to wain towards the end. On the negative side it's not a big departure from the original & the ending which felt very familiar if you know what I mean was a bit of a let down, an anti-climax as it were. But then we all know that it wasn't the end was it? Yet another sequel & the last to date Scream 3 (2000) made an appearance 3 years later. Having said that I doubt you will guess the killers identity. The kills are surprising not very graphic apart from one slit throat which was a bit of a disappointment as one character rightly points out the death scenes in sequels should be bigger & bloodier, Wes Craven I hope your listening! The characters are all very likable & the cast, many of whom return from the original, do a good job. Any film with Courtney Cox, Neve Campbel & Sarah Michelle Gellar can't be all bad can it, eh lads? Technically scream 2 is very polished & well made with nice production values but with a budget of $24,000,000 that's the least I expect. One curious thing about Scream 2 was the fact that I found it a very bright film, a lot of it takes place during the day & in brightly lit rooms for which Scream 2 probably loses some atmosphere. Overall I liked Scream 2 a lot, it's great entertainment, it's not too gory & it's funny especially if your a horror fan because you'll understand & appreciate the jokes & swipes at the genre. Definitely worth a watch."

","It is necessary in some ways to have a sequel when in the first film it is mentioned, and it is an okay film. The film starts with Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett Smith) and her boyfriend Phil Stevens (House's Omar Epps) being murdered at a screening of the new movie, Stab, based on the Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) book. Now, a new ""Ghostface"" killer (voiced by Roger Jackson) is duplicating Woodboro in a new town and killing people with similar names, e.g. Casey 'Cici' Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now under close observation by the cops, old friend Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette), Gail and her new boyfriend Derek (Stand by Me's Jerry O'Connell). The big twist for most people is that the killer is not the man once accused of killing Sidney's mother, recently released and pursuing Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), it is in fact Mickey Altieri (Timothy Olyphant), but it is his partner that shocks, it is Billy Loomis's mother, Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf). Also starring Jamie Kennedy as the still humorous Randy Meeks, Lewis Arquette (David's Dad) as Chief Lewis Hartley, Duane Martin as Joel Jones, Heather Graham as 'Stab' Casey and Tori Spelling as 'Stab' Sidney/Herself. It was never going to be as good as the first, because there are only a few great twists and turns, but it is still some good scripting by Kevin Williamson with one or two scares and some alright giggles. To be honest, I only knew of and wanted to see it because I saw the spoof in Scary Movie before it, but it is a reasonable horror comedy sequel. Worth watching!"

","With the original murders now made into a best selling book and film, someone on campus begins to kill in the same way as before. As Sidney's (Campbell) friends begin to die off suspicion seems to point to all those round her.<br/><br/>I didn't really like the first Scream - I thought it was clever but that it revelled in it's own cruelty. Here the same problems exist. This wants to be a teen slasher movie but also be clever and look down it's nose at other slashers. It starts with the movie within a movie and uses that to make jokes out of all the things that were thrown at it first time round - causing real life violence, having no black people etc and of course it gets to discuss the rules for horror sequels and make fun of those. My problem with this is that it wants to laugh at slasher movies but also do the very things it's laughing at. This may be good once but twice and the joke wears thin, also when it is dealing with real-life issues rather than film 'rules' it is harder to swallow and misses the mark.<br/><br/>For example Jada Pinkett derides the film Stab for being ""a white film"" and having ""no black people"" etc, just like the first Scream. But you get the feeling that this joke is a sore spot because now we have several black leads in the film even when a group of white sorority girls are onscreen they will contain a token black character. The colour shouldn't be an issue, but by pointing it out and then ensuring that Scream 2 has plenty it makes you think all the black actors are there jut to make up a quota. It's the same in other areas - the opening murders in the cinema are meant to make us look at this crowd enjoying on-screen murder watch as Pinkett is killed. We're supposed to see how macabre it is that the audience loves the onscreen violence and then see how abhorrent Pinkett's terror-filled gruesome death is.....but then we (the audience) sit and get entertained by the violence and killing that follows. I do feel that the film can't have it both ways - say ""look at this isn't it terrible"" and proceed to do just what it was making fun of.<br/><br/>If horror is your thing then this is quite good. It has plenty of scares and jumps but it is just too cruel to be entertaining - it seems to not take fun from the excitement or the horror but from the sheer cruelty of the murders. It's not as scary as the first and most of the time you know what's going to happen - which is why the film ups the gore and cruelty of the killings - to give us something new and interesting. Outside of this the plot is funny at times but it isn't as self-referential as before. The best bits involve in-jokes among the cast such as Cox's character responding to nude internet pictures of her by saying it was just her head put onto Jennifer Anniston's body. But for the most part the mystery plot is silly and you do just sit and watch good-looking teens get picked off for 2 hours. The eventual twist is stupid - as one of the characters says ""Wow! What a twist! bet you didn't see that coming!"" Well, no - but only because the twist is so unpredictable that it's stupid. The film spends so much time making all the characters look suspicious and putting EVERYONE in a situation where they could be the killer, only to then go and do that!<br/><br/>The original cast all return with the addition of several black faces to even it up (Pinkett, Epps, Elise Neal and others) and a few famous TV faces (Buffy's Gellar, Ally McBeal's Portia de Rossi, Laurie Metcalf) all do well as the killer's victims. The film appears to be more carefree about killing it's main cast but bottles it at the end and makes sure it's got enough left over for a sequel. David Arquette and his wife have the most fun but other leads such as Gellar and Campbell just run around screaming with not much else to do until they die or confront the killer. Sad that the most beautiful woman in this only lasts 5 minutes (Pinkett) before being dispatched, Omar Epps deserved more than he got as well - but I guess the film isn't quite as equal opps as it would like to think.<br/><br/>Overall a horror movie that replaces scares with cruelty and insults us all by making us think that we can figure it all out before screwing us with an ending that comes out of nowhere. The cast were not shown the ending until the end of shooting but I feel that if they had they wouldn't have been able to rehearse with a straight face."
"movies2u","8","0","1","12 June 2001"," Not as good as the first, but I liked it!
","""Scream 2"" was not as good as the original ""Scream"". Scream 2 was not that bad, but I enjoyed it. The one thing I enjoy about the Scream movies is that, the killer can actually get hurt. In most slasher films, you can't even scratch the killer without him stabbing you, or cutting of your head. In the Scream movies the killer will get hurt if you hit him. He will fall if you push him. He will hurt if you cut him. At least these movies are realistic. I mostly enjoy all of the Scream movies, this one wasn't perfect, but I still enjoy it. The film is very good, but not perfect. I still enjoy this film, even if there are some things about it that I don't like. I'm going to watch ""Scream 3"" today, so I hope I enjoy it like I enjoy most of the Screams. Overall, I like this movie, and it is very enjoyable. I give it a 9 out of 10."
"markealeswhite","Null","0","1","9 November 2002"," Good Movie
","This Movie is nearly as good The First. The old faces are back for more scares. I thought it was better than most follow ups. The Cast is Just as good. Matthew Lillard has a Little Cameo. So Does Rose Mcgoawn Well is Meant To Anyway. I Enjoyed it Anyway."
"Quinoa1984","7","0","4","12 July 2000"," A Drop off
","I must say this film isn't as good as the first (if that's saying anything) but it is much better than part 3.  I already knew it was better than part 3, but when I first saw this I was conflicted about whether or not this film was better than the first.  Then I realized it waa almost equal in scares and laughs and surprises.  But the first was actually more original (even though it was inspired greatly by many other movies).  Actually though, that doesn't stop anyone from seeing this movie.  I still recommend this film to teens looking for a few laughs and plenty of scares in the Craven tradition. Just don't go watching this film looking for the best horror film ever made, that's all.  Cameos include Jada Pinkett-Smith, Tori Spelling and director Wes Craven.  A-"
"tricky7771","4","0","1","6 July 2000"," Great cast. Great crew. Terrible movie.
","Wes Craven is a wonderful director, but left me hanging.  Poor motive, poor writer, poor audience.  The mystery to the identity of the killer(s) was unsolvable, leaving us with one clue each.  Unsatisfying conclusion.  A waste of space in the great Scream Trilogy."
"michaelRokeefe","5","0","1","20 May 2000"," Here we go again. The ghost mask stabber stabs again.
","Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson give us a second helping of SCREAM. Is it art imitating life imitating art? This sequel actually has its own life. The survivors of the original are back; two years after the first frenzy caused by a killer wearing a ghost mask. The body count keeps increasing. The screams end with a non-predictable climax.<br/><br/>Repeat performers include Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette. Smaller parts go to Jada Pinkett, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Tori Spelling.<br/><br/>Give it a chance. This is a little better than the earlier forecasted criticism."
"Kai-18","Null","0","1","6 May 2000"," Good sequel but yet another let down ending.
","This movie was good but the ending was as disappointing as the originals. It was a little to similar to that of the first Scream so it didn't sit well.  But horror movies endings are only REALLY good with a twisted joke or a Twilight Zone-esque ending (though there are probably exceptions).  Anywho this is a nice tongue in cheek (or wound) slasher flick that's better than most Wes Craven stuff.  The biggest problem: my favourite character dies. Plus I think that character should have been played by Seth Green (if you know who I'm talkin' about)."
"todd2u","Null","0","1","8 April 2000"," not as good as the original
","I liked this movie but it wasn't as good as the first one. In fact the third one is better than this one. Don't get me wrong i really liked , but it just wasn't as good. It kept me in suspense. Who the killer was sure surprised me. If you haven't watched the third one i recommend it. Anyway i would recommend this film to anyone who likes Scream, and likes to scream."
"alice liddell","6","0","1","31 March 2000"," Oedipus not the king.
","Still fun: it was never going to live up to the original, but its remarkable how shoddy this sequel is.  The comedy is minimised in favour of excessive violence, which, because the script avoids building up character, has, ironically, less impact than the original.  The early dispatch of Sarah Michelle Gellar without giving her anything to do is criminal, while Neve Campbell's inexpressivity is almost Franjuesque.  The amusingly pretentious references to Greek theatre add to the spirit of play and do give force to the film's best scene, when Gail watches Dewey (as Oedipus) being attacked."
"Petey-10","Null","0","1","11 November 1999"," Scary movie part 2
","Scream is back!With more blood and with more bodies.It's been 2 years since the killings in town.Now Sidney is in college.And there has been a movie made about those happenings.It's called Stab and it bases on Gale Weathers' book.And then the psychotic killings start again.And Sidney is again in danger.And everybody else in the town.Revenge has pretty much to do with this.Dewey Riley is needed again.Scream 2 is just about as good as was part 1.The actors do a great job as they did also in part 1.Great sequel.Makes you scream for Scream 3.And it's coming before you notice."
"CharltonBoy","6","0","1","23 July 1999"," The same as the original?
","scream 2 is very very much like the original which i suppose is what they were trying to do, to carry on from the first movie's success. Without giving anything away the people who get killed and the people who do the killing are very predictable as is the whole movie.It was not that bad though , i just hope they dont make a scream 3 because they have just about exhausted the story line. 6 out of 10"
"jaws!","9","0","1","6 July 1999"," more points about this movie
","i still think scream 2 is better than scream. first off the new characters in scream 2 are not as annoying as some in the first movie,and the death scenes are bigger,and better than the first one. the only thing about scream thats better than scream 2 is the ending. the ending isn't a lot better,just a bit better. but the rest of scream in my opinion kind of pales in comparsion to scream 2. i just watch both of the movies,and when i watch them,im just simply more entertained by scream 2 than the first one. another thing for the past 2 years the first scream has been highly overrated by the media,and other people. the first scream is a good movie,but it's just not as good as the media makes it out it be. it's not the best horror movie ever made. in my opinion there was not another movie in 1997 that was as entertaining as scream 2. i also think scream 2 is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever. but it isn't that scary. but it knows how to be an extremely entertaining horror movie without being that scary. im not one of those people that thinks theres hardly ever a good sequel that comes out. i think there are more than a few sequels out there that are just as good as the first one,and a lot of times better. however there are more original movies out there that are better than it's sequels. im just pointing out sequels are not nearly as bad as a lot of people say. i give scream 2 ***1/2 out of ****"
