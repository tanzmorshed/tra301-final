","Smart and funny, absurd and a bit self-conscious but as soon as I had time to think, I thought. The cast is fun but reeks of pre-sales needs. The names in the cast propels you to expectation that are going to let you down no matter how you put it. George Clooney is great fun but try, just try to imagine a great actor you never heard of in that part. I couldn't separate the character from the actor not for a second. So I saw Clooney being funny and that does something to the film that keeps its real intentions at arms length because the star-actor gets in the way. I have a feeling however that time will be kind to this film. Audiences will be able to see it again in years to come with more objectivity and appreciate it much more."
"sabretoothmovies","8","57","71","5 January 2010"," The Men Who Stare at Goats (so as to become Jedi Warriors and create world peace while possibly under the influence of LSD) Any questions?
","Even from the title, a person can guess that this movie will be different. Men staring at goats doesn't seem like the most interesting plot line; maybe then does the movie aim to be original rather than just having commercial appeal? The answer is a resounding yes. Men Who Stare at Goats is absurd, odd, hilarious, amusing, definitely original, possibly good and not at all what you would expect.<br/><br/>The plot, well the plot is complicated and involves a present-time storyline that is broken up between flashbacks. In short, George Clooney and Ewan McGregor are on one hell of a road trip in Iraq while Clooney tells McGregor about his time in a secret army training program, bent on creating Jedi warriors. So it's your typical movie. What it really is is one of those smart-and-dumb-at-the-same-time -comedies-that-involves- George-Clooney; films such as Burn After Reading and The Informant (which he produced) also fall into this category. Whether you like this movie or not, will depend on how accepting you are of the ridiculous. The movie deals with developing Jedi warriors in a comedically serious way that will be just too much for some people. The sixties counter culture is popular target for jokes in films, but an army program run by a long-haired hippy, working on world peace by dancing, that's pushing it. My personal feeling for the movie was overall positive; it was original and some segments were genuinely funny. Also on the plus side was the acting. The two leads were good, though McGregor had some accent slips, but the supporting cast was also impressive. Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and Stephen Lang all embraced the absurdity of their roles and played them with relish. <br/><br/>As for the comedy, the movie is funny. Some parts drag on a little long with no laughs but patience is always rewarded. Jokes in this movie are both smart and dumb, mixing slapstick with intellectual comedy. Clooney running over someone he's trying to rescue falls in the slapstick category; a guy explaining why the US has to finance the Jedi training because the USSR thinks there already financing it is smart funny. Kevin Spacey's ""psychic voice"" is just plain funny. <br/><br/>To finish off, I can only think to repeat that the movie is absurd and just plain odd, but then again so is real life. If the US can torture people with Barney why can't they train people with Star Wars?"
"bilko-1","10","113","149","13 March 2010"," An Instant Classic
","After reading some of the reviews here, I came to this film expecting to be disappointed. How wrong I was! It turned out to be one of the funniest, most powerful films that I have seen in years. It reminded me of some of the great movies of the sixties and seventies. Times have changed and it seems that people no longer get the kind of satire that grabbed us back then. I was constantly reminded of films like ""Catch 22,"""" M.A.S.H."" ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" and ""Steelyard Blues."" In those days, we got it. Now, people see that ""Hippy Philosophy"" thing as a cliché. They cannot see the relevance to today's world, which is a pity. ""The Men Who Stare At Goats' is a genre film, in the tradition of those great comic satires that challenged the status quo so effectively, 40 years back. I truly believe its reputation will grow, over the years."
"jeff-coatney","8","33","43","7 November 2009"," I loved this film. Clooney and Spacey were particularly hilarious
","The story borrows liberally from the exploits of Joe McMoneagle and Ingo Swann and the cadré of Remote Viewers stationed at Fort Meade, MD, under the operational detachment Project Stargate. Yes, as the film states upfront: ""More of this is true than you would believe"". There are instances in the film that incorporate actual Stargate operations: tracking submarines, finding a kidnapped American General in Italy and the search for Noriega following the US invasion of Panama. The comedy comes from the disconnect that the professional military hierarchy has from the rest of us. The Pentagon has too much money at its disposal and its internal political dynamics encourage a bizarre mixture of risk-averse yet forward-thinking innovators. This was particularly rampant after our loss in Vietnam. Vietnam and the Cold War combined to pull the Pentagon Brass in a thousand different directions and created a schism in the strategic planning sectors that is ripe for comedic exploration. Grant Heslov deftly captured this cultural watershed through his direction of the film. He ably guided the actors in performances that while sometimes brief, captured the totality of the real absurdity that the military can sometimes give us, while keeping the characters real and grounded and not drifting into farce. Heslov has captured an elusive tone, entirely his own, that I've only previously seen in Coen Brother's films. This is a story I've longed to see told on the big screen and it was worth the wait. You could say its a story about the Military-Insanity Complex, but that's too broad a brush for this slice of American military history. Clooney is brilliantly understated as always, he's a master of subtlety and an actor that understands how powerful the camera can be. Kevin Spacey is throughly despicable as the film's only real villain. If the film has any flaws at all its that Spacey is not in it enough. But the most poignant character is beautifully drawn by Jeff Bridges, who in just a few scenes depicts the inevitable trajectory of the innovative free-thinker in a rigid, uncaring system. Bridges shows us the cost of being that individual and Heslov gives the film room to explore this aspect of the story without sacrificing the reason we're all there to watch: and that is to have a laugh at something that maybe should never have happened but did."
"catie_x","10","36","48","26 March 2010"," Very inspiring
","I understand that not everyone will get this movie, but for me it was an overwhelming emotional ride because I share the same philosophy as the character Bill Django (Jeff Bridges). I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to ask questions about why things are the way they are in our world and wonders what we can do to change it. It was intelligent and funny, and will probably be appealing to more open-minded viewers. There are too few movies like this and I enjoyed that it made me think. It has that altruistic feel to it that doesn't sit well with everyone based on some other reviews, which perhaps makes it an even more important movie for our times."
"pete-wiley","6","205","311","10 November 2009"," Quirky Premise, Clunky Execution
","Watching Grant Heslov's ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" was tantamount to staring at a stick of dynamite - for 93 minutes - that never exploded. All the critical mass of a quirky, eccentric comedy (i.e., an able cast, a political pseudo-relevance) seemed to be undercut by clunky writing, tacky 'Watch people fall down, get run over, and laugh' stunts, and a painfully disjointed plot which can barely be deemed a plot at all. Rather, the movie featured more of a direction: an ill-defined, ill-conceived mission toward which two characters (Clooney's Lyn Cassady and McGregor's Bob Wilton) floated. The problem with the loose plot development, in this case, is that Clooney's chemistry with McGregor feels forced and their connection in the film equally contrived. The film was peppered with flashback (to which Bridges and Spacey owe the majority of their on-screen time) which jettisoned any chance the viewer had with feeling an investment toward the central story or its characters. In fact, the film stumbles from character to character so often that the viewer is caught juggling them under the central story arc -- and we never really care about most of them in the first place.<br/><br/>""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" allows for some laughs and some admirable situational ironies. But don't expect the brilliance and subtlety of ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""American Beauty."""
"Soundstage8","8","285","441","2 October 2009"," Terrific movie! Hilarious, smart and interesting.
","I just got back from seeing ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" at the Woodstock Film Festival. I walked in knowing the main plot, and I expected it to be pretty good because of the great actors it has, the premise of the story and the music used in the soundtrack. My expectations weren't only met, but they were greatly exceeded.<br/><br/>The story follows a broken-hearted journalist (McGregor) who goes on the job to Iraq to prove to his ex-wife he isn't weak or frail. There, he meets Lyn Cassidy (Clooney) who is a ""psychic"" soldier for the US government, trained by his hippie instructor Billy (Bridges) to use his mind, peace and love to overcome hairy military situations. The story is the two mens' adventure together.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially broken down into I'd say 3 parts. The first part is the main story of the journalist and Lyn as they travel in Iraq on a special mission Lyn is on. The second is the very humorous back-story of the history of the creation and existence of the ""psychic soldiers"" of the military. When I say ""back-story"" and ""history"" I mean the main background to Lyn and Billy's character, as well as the main antagonist of the story, played by Kevin Spacey. The third part is the first person narration provided by Ewen McGregor about the things that are going on. He offers insight into his mind and opinions on the things he says and of himself and Lyn as the story progresses.<br/><br/>The Men Who Stare at Goats is a very hilarious movie, with many quotable lines and excellent acting by the entire cast. The story is very unique and the film uses that as a great advantage to itself in setting up the humor. The characters are very real and are taken to heart right away. The film is funny, intriguing, smart, witty, fast-paced, emotional, enjoyable and inspirational. I highly recommend it to any Ewen McGregor, George Clooney, Kevin Spacey or Jeff Bridges fan, for fans of those men will not be disappointed with the acting and mannerisms of the characters those actors portrayed.<br/><br/>The Men Who Stare at Goats is a very fun movie to see in theaters and everyone in my audience were cracking up laughing many, many times. It is a movie for casual movie goers and film aficionados alike. Go see it.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"gdsiefkes","10","23","30","8 March 2011"," From Psych to Psic (Sick?)
","Does no one understand this film? It's not linear. Well, has any human life path been linear? Are we given a picture at birth, or are we given a piece of a puzzle? The piece gives us suggestions, it gives us alternatives. We now have some idea as to where we are going. Nothing definitive. We are all now remote viewers. One piece leads to another piece, and another set of possibilities. Gradually Bob Wilton finds his purpose.<br/><br/>More importantly, however, the film captures perfectly the sense of loss, the sense of descending darkness, as we move from the flower power 60's to the present, from a belief in the mind as a wonder to a brain that is to be controlled. Larry Hooper, perfectly played by Kevin Spacey, is a talent-less egomaniac that becomes the black hole that sucks up all the light. All the performances are superb, it's just the audiences that have become witless."
"Gareth_Pontin","6","158","243","7 November 2009"," A good film, but not without its flaws
","Well, I must say that I was looking forward to this movie - after reading the cast list and hearing a brief overview of the plot I felt that it had good potential. And whoever made the trailer did a very good job of making me want to see it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there seemed to me to be a certain amount of confusion about the film - were the directors entirely sure what type of film they were making? There are elements of comedy, satire, drama, action... but without having enough of each of these things to really give the movie a proper feel or direction. It veers close to being funny... and then veers off. It comes close to satirising American military tactics... and then goes off in another direction. I felt that a little more focus was needed overall to bring the film together.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, I think that generally the actors can be pleased with their work - I don't remember any specific cases of over or underacting, and the characters were about as believable as they could be in a film like this. As far as the comedy goes - this film was primarily marketed as a comedy - there are some genuinely funny moments! Overall, however, I felt that some bits needed to be trimmed down - the constant Jedi references were funny the first time but quickly wear thin.<br/><br/>The plot also needed a little bit of work: it started off with a promising storyline, and good editing I might add, but seemed to lose its way towards the end. It seemed as if the film-makers didn't really know where to go next. There were a few scenes that really didn't need to be included either - Robert Patrick's contribution to the film really added nothing, and could easily be removed. It was entirely forgettable and was simply a device to get the characters to the next place that they needed to be.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say this this is a fairly good film, certainly worth seeing. As for buying the DVD, that I'm not so sure about. If you're looking for a way to spend and hour and a half of your evening, while there are better films to see than this there are also considerably worse ones."
"wagodago","10","16","20","24 January 2011"," loved it!
","I hate to slam anyone who didn't like and enjoy this movie. They chose four of the very best actors who fit together like a glove. I found it to be exceptional acting. Although many of you might only watch a movie once and then give up I don't know how many times I have seen it. Each time I decide to turn it on, as I have it recorded in two rooms, I laugh from beginning to end. And, I wouldn't be surprised if some day we find out that parts of this are very true. I just heard last week that the government is looking into paranormal tactics. What a surprise. Could very well be that it's just another one of our country's secrets. I'm just sorry I didn't know it was being shot in New Mexico as I am not too far from Roswell. I would have loved to have been there. I have searched and searched for the bloopers but cannot find them. There is no way the four head actors could have possibly made this movie without falling apart. Oh well.....those of you who didn't really get into it.....sorry....it is so well done and so very funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sue"
"Doctor_Mongoose","7","106","170","13 November 2009"," A great way to spend a lazy afternoon with a couple of mates
","I'm going to say its definitely up there in the top few films I've seen at the cinema this year. It has been criticised for lacking more biting criticism of the US government, but I think people who are saying that are missing the point. It does have a fair bit to say about how stupid the US Military can be and how they like to blow money on obviously pointless ventures, but there is a whole other side to it.<br/><br/>I thought that the film was more about the human spirit and how that if you want to make a difference and want to do something you've got to really go for it no matter how stupid the aim. Obviously the idea of trying to be a psychic spy is unattainable and may sound ludicrous, but so may be the notion of trying to create world peace and help bring different people together over a united cause. The film was more about how these drifters and lost souls managed to find something that they found worthy of pursuing and really devoted themselves to it, and I think this message is more admirable than any side-criticism of the USA.<br/><br/>The film plays out mainly as a buddy movie with Geogre Clooney, who is doing his usual comic act very well, and Ewan McGregor as they head around Iraq not really knowing what they are looking for and getting into loads of hilarious antics along the way. I don't think I've laughed so much in the cinema this year, and the whole audience was laughing along as well.<br/><br/>I thought the structure was hardly groundbreaking, but done really well. Flashbacks involving Jeff Bridges and Clooney help add comic relief during some of the straighter scenes in the film and also at times are used to rack up the tension and reveal interesting insights. It is of course up to your interpretation if the flashbacks are 100% real, because they are told from the point of view of Ewan McGregor, recounting stories that were told to him by Clooney. This sorts out another common criticism that the film is extremely unrealistic, but there are some key scenes saying that Clooney might not be telling the whole truth that I feel have been overlooked.<br/><br/>It isn't going to be Oscar-fare or the greatest thing you'll ever see but with a good cast and a lot of laughs there isn't really going to be a much better way of spending a lazy Saturday afternoon with some popcorn and a buddy or two."
"cleardawn-1","9","108","178","16 December 2009"," Pure finesse!
","I laughed so much I ended coughing! Even more so when I imagined how hard it had to be for the actors to remain that serious trough the hilariously stupidities of almost every scene.<br/><br/>I found it brilliant because it had not an ounce of sanity, and it is difficult now a days to catch a good, funny script that says so much in saying nothing. It's all in the eyes! <br/><br/>Do not expect coherence, it cannot have it and that's the geniality of the whole movie. All the characters are as absurd as they can be, ambivalent, retarded, inspired and generous... No need to look for more ingredients to make a perfect funny concoction, worthy of your time and money."
"octagon88","8","13","17","23 March 2010"," Absolutely hilarious!
","It's worth mentioning, too, that, like McGregor, another actor has been doing some good, different, and mostly unsung work lately. After voicing Gerty the robot in Moon and making an unexpectedly amusing cameo in the Britflick Telstar, Kevin Spacey is just terrific as Larry Hooper, the cynical Darth Vader to Django's Luke Skywalker. And when Bridges, Clooney and Spacey are all on screen, The Men Who Stare At Goats feels most alive — like a military version of Anchorman, with a more subtle sense of stupidity — while Heslov's bright, heightened colour palette adds the sense of an almost magical, distant summer. Such moments are as close as the film gets to a point — like the custard-pie fight that was cut from Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, this is a black comedy about national security, and the ridiculous demands that paranoia will feed.<br/><br/>Despite its myriad minor pleasures, however, Heslov's film is the perfect showcase for the things Clooney does best. Arguably, this is his best comedy performance since O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and it certainly comes from the same stable. Like O Brother's Everett McGill, Lyn Cassady is a bit of a Dapper Dan, frequently in a tight spot. But where McGill was a likable fool, Cassady is more complex; like a Woody Allen superhero, he's a mixture of the daft and the divine, and the fact that his psychic powers do often come to the fore gives this material a weird, old-fashioned Saturday Morning Serial flavor, and this is what the film relies on for the final act. Just as Superman came flying down to save the maiden tied to the train tracks, we find ourselves waiting for Cassady to swoop down and tie up all those tantalising loose ends.<br/><br/>Though Heslov and writer Peter Straughan try their best, however, there just isn't a satisfactory end to this movie to be found, and the one they've come up with — as enjoyable as it is — is not only underwhelming, it feels like an obvious redeployment of everything we've seen, with a little sprinkling of sentiment that, though tongue-in-cheek, doesn't feel right. For the most part, though, The Men Who Stare At Goats, like Inglourious Basterds before it, marks a return to the long-lost idea that there ought to be some fun in movies, and it's a testament to George Clooney's willingness to experiment that, at a time when he really ought to be prepping for his next Oscar, he's up for a laugh and happy to share the fantastic time he's having. Will it be a big hit? It's doubtful. But even if it flops, Clooney won't be slipping to the number three slot anytime soon.<br/><br/>All in all, very much worth watching. Very underrated movie. 8/10"

","Great Movie!! Screw what you movie journalists or reviewers may feel it lacked.<br/><br/>It was fantastic, reminded me of catch 22 meets fear and loathing. Great acting and directing. All around I can't think of a negative thing about this film. I read some review, early on that is sustained the same joke the entire movie. Which is wrong! It was awesome, in the most stone age sense of the word. Ewan and George where great cast combo, and Kevin Spacey and others all fitted in perfectly. As I type this at nearly 3:30am after work and a great showing of the film. Doubters of this film, cut out! You will never understand the undertow of great sarcasm and acting of this picture. Otherwise it had never ceased to entertain and to show what good comedies are made of these days in this grim ""twilight"" and ""harry potter"" filled ruled time."

","While doing his boring job as a reporter-journalist, one man stumbles upon the existence of an old military secret: a branch of soldiers trained in harnessing their mental superpowers. Coincidentally, after heading off to Iraq for an inside scoop on the 2003 war, he meets another member of this secret group and his misadventures begin.<br/><br/>There's some weird obsession with ""Star Wars"" in this film. Besides the obvious talk of Jedi Warriors, there's a scene early on where the main character makes a reference to blonde farm boy, which is clearly meant to be Luke Skywalker. (What's interesting is that later the guy claims to have not seen the movies, so it's odd that he would make cryptic references.)<br/><br/>I cannot say enough about the amazing cast. Ewan MacGregor, Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and George Clooney, among others. The most disappointing thing about this film is that with such an amazing cast that you would think this would be the year's blockbuster, but actually will more than likely be no more than a blip on the cinematic radar.<br/><br/>I don't know what's up with Roger Ebert and his Lebowski obsession. In his review, he repeatedly says that Lebowski fans will like this one and that Jeff Bridges plays his role as Lebowski playing a military man. Well, I could see some Lebowski in there, and like that other film, they both involve Iraq. But, really, I see Lebowski when I see Jeff Bridges, so that's not really a stretch. Ebert really took it beyond the necessarily bounds.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film comes up short. With this cast, as I said, I expect something more. There is humor, but it's here and there. And even the plot, which is interesting, doesn't really seem to be as strong as it should be. A good film, and one I recommend to George Clooney fans, but not a hidden treasure."

","It was a terrific movie, but not for everyone. It was thoroughly enjoyable, and completely unexpected. I was anticipating a ""simpler"" comedy from the previews, and although there were some slapstick elements, the movie was significantly more complex. Many of the negative comments are that the movie either jumps around too much, or is not connected well, but if you know the factual parts of the movie, the Men Who Stare at Goats is connected, and it makes perfect sense. I was debating if the next would be considered a ""spoiler"", but it's purely historical information, some of which is in my American History textbook, so I'll list some general historical knowledge that will undoubtedly make the movie more enjoyable. First, Lt. Col. Jim Channon created the First Earth Battalion, where soldiers would carry flowers into battle, and use techniques such as, ""Starry Eyes"". The CIA did give soldiers LSD without their knowledge, and Special Forces were trained to be ""psychic spies"" during the Vietnam and Cold Wars.<br/><br/>The movie was a very witty black comedy, with elements of action, comedy, and satire. Although the movie is fiction, many of the events have happened, or closely mirror events that have or could have happened, making it even more entertaining.<br/><br/>9/10 if you're into witty comedy!"

Jeff Bridges is fantastic in his role as an Army Sci Ops commando leader. Stopping a heart of a goat by simply looking at it? With your mind? You gotta be kidding. Anyway, George Clooney here is also in the Sci Ops squad, and uses his gift for good purposes. Trick is, if you use the power to bring good stuff into reality, the circle will move in the right direction.

","After seeing the previews for this movie I was very eager to see the entire thing. If I had known beforehand how this movie was, I would have chosen another title to watch instead.<br/><br/>The cast is all star, and was one of the draws for this movie. Many of these actors are my favorites and I felt they each had a capability to bring something special to the table. Unfortunately, they did not. Talk about a waste of talent.<br/><br/>The movie was confusing as to its' true intent. Was this a comedy, social commentary, drama, coming of age story, anti-war flick? What was the director trying to hit? It seemed as though elements of all these genres were present without actually being delved into with any sort of depth.<br/><br/>I was unable to bring myself to care about McGregor's character. His own personal journey, the need to prove himself- it just didn't seem compelling to me. Instead he seemed more like a child whining about needing an adventure. Perhaps if the movie had focused more on his character and development instead of throwing two wars, a psychic battalion, and the three-way fight between Spacey, Clooney, and Bridges, McGregor's character would have been more believable. As such it felt as though there were too many independently interesting parts to the story to all get enough time in the 93 minute movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences are pretty mild and supposed to drive the satire of the film but somehow it all felt hollow and forced. Several examples of this shallow attempt at bringing large and important social commentary points home occur in Iraq. We are shown the characters being kidnapped by thugs and sold to Al Qaeda. The scene feels forced and doesn't really fit with the story other than to provide another excuse for Clooney's character to have nothing but time to relate his background. The scene does not drive up to care for the characters, feel for their safety, or even feel the natural confusion of that situation. Instead we sit and patiently await whatever plot device moves the characters along to their next scene.<br/><br/>In another scene we see private security contractors acting in a Hollywood stereotype, shooting up the town (apparently Ramadi) for no reason other than to illustrate how evil all us Americans must be. This scene still falls short and ends without ever needing to happen, and feels as much. It is entirely forgettable and doesn't serve to set up the next scene where an Iraqi man helps the characters along their journey. We neither feel badly about the contractors' actions nor identify with the plight of the locals before it all swirls away into the next scene where we see the main characters walking away from an IED (thrown in for chic-ness) while dusting themselves off.<br/><br/>Perhaps most annoying were the constant 'Jedi' references. While funny the first time by the end of the movie it feels like George Lucas pulled a prank and rewrote the script before filming started. Ironically, I felt that the joke would not have been so overplayed had McGregor not been in the movie. As it was, this line kept pulling me out of this movie and reminding me of ""Star Wars"".<br/><br/>The movie fails in its' effort at social commentary as well.

","Wars are bad investments in many ways. One of those, it seems is that a war — even a huge, long war — allows only one great ""perspective movie.""<br/><br/>WWII =""Catch 22""<br/><br/>Korean War = ""M A S H""<br/><br/>Cold War = ""Doctor Stangelove""<br/><br/>Vietnam = ""Apocalypse Now.""<br/><br/>I register this film as the one the world bought by going to war in Iraq. At three trillion dollars and the bending of a national soul for generations, it is pretty expensive. But it does well in my book. It matters a lot to me that we discover new places to observe ourselves. I believe that initially those places — if truly new in the narrative world — will seem both magical and humorous. These films will confuse; war is a confusing beast, but enlighten merely because of their existence.<br/><br/>As an experience, this movie had more laugh out loud moments for me than any film in recent memory. There is s seamless mix of cheap slapstick and profoundly sophisticated humor, and the mix tricks you into laughing at hard things, believing them to be simple ones.<br/><br/>Two things are notable. The first is that some substantial part of this is not just about wars, but about war movies, and specifically ""Star Wars."" Ewan plays the fellow who is folded into this movie: the guy who wrote it and is our enchanted on-screen narrator. He is discovered to have Jedi qualities. As his wide-eyed character discovers the secret program of psychic warriors, he himself becomes part of the war-joke by reference to the rather daft celebration of violence we have in movies, merely because it is cinematic.<br/><br/>The second cool thing is the way that imagination within the story reaches outside the story. There are the usual folds of course: a book written about an encounter that has an interwoven flashback history. But these folds have psychic insight that crosses the boundaries. This magical reality of insight allows the jokes to also cross the boundaries or folds, into the essence of the stupidities of this conflict and incidentally allowing that mix of satire and slapstick I mentioned. It is really quite brilliant: Spike Jonez sort of stuff.<br/><br/>The only real deficiency is the end, which is profoundly mis-imagined. I suppose that is appropriate, given the conflict itself. But you walk out remembering the failed end and not the successful views beforehand.<br/><br/>I do not know the book. It supposedly claims connection with ""real facts."" At least one is wrong: the research on psychics was in the 70s, and not connected with the New Earth Army. The psychic business was significant. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is a fascinating subject that gets the ""Saturday Night Live"" treatment. It's all based on fact (from Jon Ronson's book) but the concept is so silly that director Grant Heslov and George Clooney (both worked on ""Good Night, and Good Luck) really can't help but make fun of it, and there are some good laughs here. Just no real story.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor plays journalist Bob Wilton, a jilted husband who goes to war to forget his backstabbing wife only to end up wiling away in Kuwait. One night he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), a familiar name to him from a previous interview he did years before about psychic-spies. Lyn was the best in what was called the ""New Earth Army"", started by Vietnam-Vet Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) in the 80's to create soldiers with super-powers who could prevent conflict. The Army was later dismantled and used for evil purposes by the movie's antagonist Hooper (Kevin Spacey) but Lyn tells Bob he's been re-activated, and has a secret mission to do in Iraq. Bob, thinking Lyn crazy but interesting at the same time, decides to team up with him and go where the action is. Along the way, Lyn tells him stories of others dubbed, ""Jedi Warriors."" <br/><br/>Most of the movie is flashbacks, beginning with Iraq War 2003 and chronicling all the way back to the beginning of New Age warfare. There are weird and crazy laughs to be had like Lyn's initiation, where Django urges him he will never be a soldier unless he can free the dance. The lines are good too. ""We tried invisibility but then worked it down to just not being seen"", Lyn tells Bob upon their first meeting. Clooney is perfectly eccentric as a guy who lives by the mindfulness-over-warfare principal and McGregor is a whiny, but solid straight-man. Bridges is also terrific as this free-spirited hippie. Only the laughs and flashbacks (which feel like a series of sketches) aren't enough to distract from the fact that ""Goats"" really has no compelling narrative. The forward-moving story in Iraq 2003 has very little momentum. Spacey appears later on again as the villain but the conflict is weak and the movie has more than over-stayed its welcome."

It is a mix of comedy, action, drama and sci-fi. None of these elements are developed enough to make it stand out or make it shine. The plot is thin and underdeveloped, it cannot decide whether it wants to convince me there are supernatural powers or makes me shiver due to all the complicated politics in the army. It does not make me care about the characters or what they do either. The ending conflict is so weakly staged which feels so contrived.

","This film tells a story about a special army unit without having a real plot as even the main characters don't seem to know where they're heading. It's just an accumulation of absurd dialogues and crazy moments with real good actors that don't consider themselves too good to act silly (not too silly) although they certainly were unchallenged by the script. The shown sense of humour reminded me slightly of the humour in the fashion of the Coen brothers in terms of pace and surreality, however, less sarcastic, less biting and without cynicism. The characters are rather likable, harmless individuals trying to find peace in a violent surrounding. I would classify this film as a satire about everything the army represents in general and once you've realized how stupid the army is you'll find this an amusing 93 minutes of fun."

","We were lucky enough to be invited to a LoveFilm preview screening of this new film in London last night and more unusually to get the unique chance as a movie goer to interact with the British author Jon Ronson, on whose book the film is based. The film follows a reporter, Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), who stumbles onto the story of a lifetime when quite by chance he meets a self confessed Special Forces Operator, Lyn Cassady (George Clooney)in a Kuwait hotel. As they embark on a new mission, Lyn reveals his twenty-year involvement in a Top Secret, black ops military unit and shares details of their activities, each more bizarre than the last (including staring at goats).<br/><br/>This is a wonderfully funny film, with quirky characters that develop as the story unfolds, characters that will have you laughing out loud and as the credits begin to roll as you get up from your seat at the end of the film you will leave the cinema still talking about the story on your way home. <br/><br/>After watching the film you would certainly have questions you would love to ask were you to have the chance - well we had that chance and did just that. Jon Ronson took questions from the floor and the first was how much of the story is based on fact - he said that the US Military under the support of several President's including Ronald Regan received significant funding to develop a psychokinetic fighting force that could be used against America's enemies using skills such as Remote Viewing and the power of the human mind to eliminate the other side. Where did the name for the book come from? Jon told us that his wife Elaine, came up with the title The Men who Stare at Goats as they were chatting about the story over a bottle of wine. Was it true that he lived next door to Naomi Campbell? This was true, he said, they were neighbours in a quiet London street and that Naomi had mentioned it during one of those Red Carpet interview's at the film's recent premier. In the film, Jon Ronson's part as the reporter is played by Ewan McGregor - so what you are watching is the author's own personal take on the story. What came out of the questions from the audience was that the US Military actually took this psychic weapon idea seriously enough that they secured significant funding for this off the wall program so to conclude it makes you realise just how crazy the people that govern us truly are!<br/><br/>Go see it - on general release November 6th 2009."

","Jon Ronson wrote the book this movie is based on. (Or was it Ron Johnson.) It must have been a pretty impressive novel otherwise the MBAs who greenlight these projects wouldn't have touched it with a ten- or even an eleven-foot pole. It brings together three elements that, perhaps in print, were seamlessly joined: comedy, nostalgia for the New Age, and social comment.<br/><br/>None of it works here, lamentably, despite the reasonably good performances by the leads and support and despite the competence of the director.<br/><br/>It's the script that's the problem. There ARE some amusing lines and funny moments in this story of a band of soldiers selected for duty in the Middle East because of their psychic powers. It's just that the funny lines and situations are so few and that they're so understated as to elicit wan smiles rather than chuckles -- and never mind laughter. My guess would be that the humor in the novel depended chiefly on internal monologues and the author's particular choice of descriptive phrases, rather than in the dialog or the situations themselves. That's a common problem with transposing comic novels to the screen, from ""Ulysses"" to ""Lolita."" And to whom is the nostalgia for New Age beliefs and activities addressed? Who's mind will click when they witness the kinds of tricks the Yippies pulled during the Vietnam war -- trying to levitate the Pentagon and whatnot? And much of the parody goes farther back in time than that, to the early 1960s, somewhere in the temporal vicinity of ""Candy."" It's a small audience indeed.<br/><br/>The social comment deals not just with the New Age but with even greater resonance with the war in the Middle East. We now have two wars going, or maybe two and a half. One is winding down in Iraq. ""Winding down"" here means we only have some 5,000 armed troops fighting and dying there. One in Afghanistan is fully blown. One in Pakistan is covert and is not happening at all.<br/><br/>The difficulty with the social comment is that these wars are so controversial and the country itself so polarized that nothing can be said about the conflicts. WHATEVER scene or statement reflects a value judgment is going to outrage half the population. The result is a chasm across which there is no tightrope. The actual wars -- the mercenary groups, the blood -- sort of loom in the background without being directly addressed.<br/><br/>Nope. It's not an insulting film. It doesn't treat the viewer as some recently evolved species of moral ape. It isn't dumbed down. It's just not successful in its enterprise. I'm tempted to give it a decoration just for taking as many chances with the audience as it does. But I can't recommend seeing it because it's so dull."

"moviemanMA","8","15","25","29 November 2009"," A story so unbelievable it has to be true
","It's tough to single out the lone factor led to The Men Who Stare at Goats being so hilarious. Was it George Clooney's impeccable comedic timing or the fact that Ewan McGregor played a Jedi in the Star Wars trilogy and was now reporting on how the US government trained soldiers to be just that? Whatever way you look at it, this is one heck of a funny movie.<br/><br/>Based on the outrageously true story by Jon Ronson, filmmaker Grant Heslov in his feature film debut brings to life this story about Bob Wilton (McGregor), a young reporter who goes to Iraq during the Gulf War to try and find a story worth telling. He ends up stumbling upon an undercover US military operation known as the Army's First Earth Battalion. This special branch's sole purpose was to create a non-lethal form of fighting enemies using psychic and telepathic means to disarm, interpret, and engage during times of distress and war.<br/><br/>The man who shows Wilton the ways of the psychic warrior is Lyn Cassady (Clooney), who tells Wilton that he has been reactivated and is currently on a top secret mission. The two embark on a journey through the desert, small towns, and through the mind.<br/><br/>I have to say that without Clooney's performance I don't know if this movie would have made it. His facial expressions and his screen presence are so powerful and outrageous that no matter what he is doing, be it trying to burst a cloud with his mind or locating missing army personnel thousands of miles away. His character is so ridiculous that you just have to go with it.<br/><br/>He is not alone though. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges play other members of the ""psychic soldier"" unit, both offering their own unique brand of comedy. Along with McGregor's witty comebacks and comments, the group will keep you laughing from start to finish.<br/><br/>The one thing the movie lacked was that spark that set it apart from other comedies. Yes the writing was above average and yes, the performances were just as good, but there was nothing that made me say, ""Wow."" The real winner here is the story and the writing and acting give it the spark to make it dance and sing.<br/><br/>It's not the funniest movie I've seen, but it's one of the most interesting and intriguing stories that you can't get enough of. You'll laugh, you'll laugh some more, and you'll have a lot of questions to send to your state representative."
"Galina_movie_fan","7","7","10","6 May 2010"," Of Men and Goats
","Some consider this darkly comical fantastically realistic comedy about a top secret special unit in the 1980's U.S. Army, a brilliant satire on war and paranoia. The others dismiss it is a failure on the level of the infamous high-budget desert comedy of the Cold War era, Ishtar (1987). I personally think ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" is a curious, cerebral, funny and poignant parody/spoof of and at the same time the dedication to many outstanding films, as different as Dr. Strangelove.., Star Wars epics, The Big Lebowski, and even the Silence of the Lambs. The famous and talented actors simply bring their characters from the earlier movies to The Men Who Stare at Goats. The film is notable for the funny, surreal narrative style with numerous leaps from present day to the not so distant past, when the two superpowers tried to create super powerful weapon against each other, using the supernatural and paranormal phenomena. This is the movie where Jeff Bridges in the full Dude Lebowski mode joins the Army and forms the Special Unit, First Earth Battalion that trains the soldiers to become the ""warrior monks"" who'd possess the supernatural power and be able to use their minds as the deadly weapon. The mandatory part of the training involves LSD experimentation and daily worship of Mother Earth as a source of supernatural abilities. This is the movie, where Obi-Wan-Konobi (Ewan McGregor) has no idea who the Jedi are, and the character played by Kevin Spacey is taken by the dark side of the force because of his supernatural stubbornness and meanness. As for George Clooneys Gus, the Master, the best in the unit in the past but lost and confused now, he can't forget the death of one goat that he caused by just staring at it during the experiments. Gus believes that if he saves one goat, just one from the cruel experiments now, the dead animal would stop staring at him in his memory with the unbearable silence of the goats.<br/><br/>In short, if you like the absurdist, off-beat, cerebral films -I highly recommend this. If not - don't stare at the goats.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

Not at lot I would say, there are far worse films out there. I give this film a ten, because of the sheer amount of effort put into it and because I consider this to be in my top ten movie list. <br/><br/>The dialogue ran smoothly, the actors were basically perfect and the concept behind the movie is hilariously brilliant. I loved it, and I was shocked when I came onto this site seeing it has such a low rating.<br/><br/>People who say this movie does not have a plot are wrong. Sure it might not have an obvious linear plot, but isn't it great the producers think of their viewers as intelligent enough to work out the plot themselves rather than being force fed it like in a lot of other movies? The plot is exploring a concept, a journey taking a look into a part of the U.S Army that seems too unbelievable to be true. It's full of hidden wit and quirks that are very amusing. I love films that manage to inform and entertain at the same time and this is one of them. I was glad the plot was not very obvious, I found it to be quite refreshing. It was nice just going along the self discovery journey with the journalist. <br/><br/>But I do understand that not everyone will get this movie, but for people who understand or at least are slightly open to the philosophy this film is presenting I recommend this film highly. It's a movie for people who like to ask questions about why things are the way they are in our world and wonders what we can do to change them. It was intelligent and funny, and will probably be appealing to more open-minded viewers. <br/><br/>'The Men Who Stares At Goats' is a intelligent comedy that had me laughing out loud, something I hardly ever do in movies or television shows that are meant to be comedies.

"JamesHitchcock","4","12","20","4 December 2009"," The two wings of General Clooney's army have got lost in the fog
","""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is the latest George Clooney production; as with most of the other films which he has produced or directed, this one is essentially a vehicle for his left-wing opinions. It was directed by his business partner Grant Heslov who wrote the script for another Clooney project, ""Good Night and Good Luck"".<br/><br/>The film is based upon a book by the British journalist Jon Ronson which tells the bizarre but apparently true story of a secret unit within the US Army called the First Earth Battalion which attempted to find military applications for ""New Age"" philosophies. The title refers to one of the unit's activities- trying to kill goats by staring at them. Other projects included trying to walk through walls, remote viewing and invisibility (not to be confused with camouflage).<br/><br/>The main character is Bob Wilton, a journalist covering the Iraq War in 2003. Wilton stumbles onto a possible scoop when he meets Lyn Cassady, a former Special Forces operator who claims to have been part of the New Earth Army (as the First Earth Battalion is referred to here). In the film it is also referred to as the ""Jedi Warriors"" after the mystical, quasi-religious warrior-monks in the ""Star Wars"" films. Wilton is at first sceptical, but becomes less so as Cassady tells him more about the history of the unit. It was founded in the 1970s by a Vietnam veteran named Bill Django who had taken six years from the Army in order to research various New Age movements. A split developed between the idealistic Django, who wanted to use his unit's powers only for espionage and other non-lethal purposes, and Larry Hooper, one of his recruits who wanted to use New Age teachings to develop new ways of killing. (To continue the ""Star Wars"" analogy, Hooper can be seen as having, like Darth Vader, gone over to the dark side of the force). Lyn left the unit in a fit of remorse after killing a goat by staring at it, believing that it is wrong to use one's psychic abilities to cause death, even the death of an animal.<br/><br/>Despite the presence of Gorgeous George and several other big names (Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey) and some reasonably good acting, this is not a very good film. It is often difficult to follow exactly what is supposed to be going on, or how far we are supposed to take Cassady's claims at face value. The obvious aim of the film was to satirise the US military, but the problem is that Clooney and Heslov are trying to satirise it from two different positions at the same time, without realising that these positions are quite irreconcilable and therefore cancel one another out. At times the film takes up a vaguely New Age position itself, arguing that what America needs is more of the idealistic, pacific values of the movement and less of the militaristic values of the Larry Hoopers of this world. At other times, however, the film seems to be taking the strictly rationalist position that New Age philosophy is all a load of baloney and that the US Army must be mad if they take such unscientific nonsense seriously.<br/><br/>""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is not nearly as good as ""Good Night, and Good Luck"". That film has its faults, but it also has its virtues, notably a fine performance from David Strathairn in the central role. Even if one disagrees with Clooney's politics, there can be no doubt that in ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" he is setting out his position clearly. One cannot say that of ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"". In military terms what has happened is that the two wings of General Clooney's army have got lost in the fog and started attacking each other, all the time believing that they are in fact inflicting significant damage on the enemy. 4/10"

","I just came back from watching this film at my school, SUNY Purchase, and I must say I was pretty satisfied. The film is interesting and was very clever and witty. George Clooney was hilarious in his role as Lyn Cassady and Ewan McGregor was perfect for his role. Besides Clooney, my favorite character was Jeff Bridges. He hasn't disappointed me before and doesn't seem like he ever will. Kevin Spacey's character kind of annoyed me and was a bit of an arrogant jerk...but...with Kevin Spacey...it should have been expected.<br/><br/>I stuck around a bit for the discussion after the movie and I realized that the movie wasn't well received by adults. The audience members that were more so in the late teens to mid twenties loved the movie. I guess due to some of the content in the movie that that was the reasoning. I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good laugh. Although at times the movie can be a bit ridiculous, it just makes the movie all the more funnier."
"DarthVoorhees","6","22","42","7 November 2009"," You don't take anything with you out of the theater
","I liked Men Who Stare at Goats reasonably well while I was watching it. It has moments of inspired humor. The problem I have with it though is it just doesn't do much. The script while humorous is weak in crucial areas of character development and plot. In the end the movie feels empty and hollow.<br/><br/>Part of why I think the film is weak is it's lack of real direction. Men Who Stare at Goats tries to be a black comedy. It isn't quite dark enough to do this. It isn't smart and urbane enough to be a quirky comedy either. What we are left with is a hybrid of several genres trying to mix together. I kept thinking I would have loved to have seen Mike Judge's take on this material. It's too dramatic to be a straight forward comedy but too serious to be a straight forward drama. The idea of trying to add dramatic elements into a story about Jedi Warriors is kind of silly to begin with. That concept actually gets more laughs from me than some of the stuff in the movie. What the film really needs is a stand out comedic actor in it's cast. I am not arguing Jeff Bridges talent and I like his performance but that role is tailor made for a comedian. Imagine what someone like Steve Carrell could do with that role or Clooney's role for that matter. A stronger comedic presence is sorely needed in this film.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is good in his role, but I don't think he is strong enough to carry this story. It's kind of funny seeing him reference Jedi warriors but there are moments when this character is simply dry. I partially blame the script but I can't let McGregor off the hook. The character's lines read as if he were a quirky Woody Allen type character. McGregor offers little of this in his performance. He is supposed to be weak like his dialogue suggests but McGregor is simply being himself. He also fades in and out of his American accent which isn't very good to begin with. I like Ewan I really do but this is by far his most disappointing performance. Again he's good in making us believe this story but he is not good to make us believe his character. He's more of a narrator than a character.<br/><br/>The plot? The movie doesn't really have one. It's more of a series of events than a plot. Ewan McGregor enters a world where the US Government in Soviet paranoia created psychic soldiers. That's the story of the movie nothing more. Our characters move from Point A to Point B for no other reason than the plot dictate that they must. There is no threat to these psychic soldiers nor any actual hints of political commentary about the military. The film could have used both. Instead it becomes a character piece with little episodic scenes. God Bless George Clooney because he takes this material very seriously. I think he could get some mild Oscar consideration because his performance is very good. Kevin Spacey is good but doesn't have anything to really do with this character. He can be a very funny actor and he gets laughs. The laughs come from a vantage point of having this serious actor play a semi-serious character doing stupid stuff. It's kind of funny is what I found myself saying through out the film.<br/><br/>I admire the film's cast and the basic concept but it's not enough for me to fully recommend the film. By all means see it on video. In the long run though it just isn't worth the talent involved."
"john-souray","1","19","36","2 August 2010"," Drivel
","There is a non-fiction book entitled ""The men who stare at goats"" by the journalist Jon Ronson. Ronson has an autobiographical style, meaning he appears as a character in his own books as the interviewer, and he describes here his attempts to track down the retired members of a former experimental army team of psychic warriors. It's well worth a read, though I understand that some people can find Ronson's sometimes faux naif style a bit grating.<br/><br/>This is not a film of that book, and the central journalist character is not a portrayal of Ronson. Apart from the title, it borrows a few ideas from the book, and just makes the rest up. The book's upstairs, but I can't be bothered to go up and check every episode. To give an indication, though, everything that takes place in the Middle East (i.e. the core plot of the film) is made up. There is some discussion of Al-Qaeda and Iraq, but the context for that is Abu Ghraib and the humiliation and torture of civilians, a different (and nastier) world altogether to the depoliticised and decontextualised sub-MASH larks of Kevin Spacey's desert base.<br/><br/>I was going to make this review an impassioned defence of Ronson's integrity, and sympathise with him for the mutilation of his book. But then I found an interview in which he seems perfectly happy with the film, proud even. Who am I therefore to complain that they've catastrophically misunderstood the point of the book? But I still say it's drivel.<br/><br/>While I'd have been happy to sit through a straight documentary, with archive footage and filmed interviews and talking heads, I don't really object to the film-makers' loss of nerve and decision to liven the story up with some fiction. It's just that if that's what you're going to do, it ought to be a lot better than this aimless, characterless, virtually plot less mess. If you're going to make it up, you ought at least to make up something interesting and worthwhile.<br/><br/>Because here's the terrible truth. There's no such thing as psychic powers. No really; they don't exist. If they did, we'd know, and there wouldn't be any argument. People can't walk through walls. People can't kill animals by the power of thought. People can't ""remote view"" and find things hundreds of miles away just by thinking about them. Had any of these things worked, the army would still be working on them.<br/><br/>The real story here was a desperately sad one about the dimensions of human folly and yearning, and also a story about frustrated and distorted idealism, because the bizarre attempt to develop a kinder and more sensitive (!) form of imperialist warfare was founded in the genuine disquiet and disgust borne from the Vietnam experience.<br/><br/>But this is not the film of that story."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The best I can do here is give this one credit for trying to be a little different. From the opening credits when we are told ''You wouldn't believe how much of this is true', the quasi-farcical approach works sometimes and falls flat at other time.<br/><br/>George Clooney begins the film at his deadpan best, but the story is so convoluted, that even he doesn't know what to do with it after that. Can't even tell you why Ewan McGregor would take his role unless he owed actor-turned-director Grant Heslov a favor. Kevin Spacey sleepwalks through another performance, though Jeff Bridges does have some fun in a 1960's style montage.<br/><br/>Mostly all I can say is I am confused how a film with so much seemingly going on, could actually be so boring. The story needed to take a real direction instead of bouncing around between is it a real secret spy program, or is it a film of self-discovery, or is it a parody, or is it a commentary? Some filmmakers can mesh different styles, but rather than meshed, this one was just messy."

The film quickly resorts to 'A' list actors falling over and getting high to steal cheap laughs.<br/><br/>A lot of what happens in the trailer does not happen in the film as it is suggested, for one thing the goat staring is a tiny portion of the film, about 10seconds.<br/><br/>Some people found it light hearted and humorous.

","After this year, it seems like we've just been disappointed back and forth with movies. We've only had a few really good movies released and The Men Who Stare at Goats seemed like it was going to pick things up. From the trailer, this not only looked like it was going to be a hit, but a possible award contender. Kevin Spacey, George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, this is an awesome powerhouse cast! Everything about this movie equaled towards a hit. But unfortunately it did fall flat. I saw this opening weekend and was really excited, but once again we are left with that ""the funny parts are in the trailer"" excuse. While the performances are good and the cast and crew gave it their all, I think it was just the story that really wasn't interesting. Because you know some of the story is fictional and not sure what to believe.<br/><br/>Daily Telegram reporter Bob Wilton, who stumbles onto the story of a lifetime when he meets a Special Forces operator, Lyn Cassady after flying to Kuwait out of anger, due to a recent divorce with his wife, who then proceeded to marry Bob's editor. Lyn reveals that he was part of an Americian army unit training psychic spies, trained skills including; invisibility, remote viewing, cloud bursting, walking through walls, and intuition. The founder of this unit Bill Django traveled across America in the 1970s for six years exploring a range of New Age movements after getting shot during the Vietnam War and used these experiences to found the New Earth Army. In the 1980s, two of Django's best recruits were Lyn Cassady and Larry Hooper developed a lifelong rivalry. Desperate for a good story, Bob dwells into Lyn's world to find out if it's nothing but a crazy story or a fun reality.<br/><br/>This movie had so much potential that I hate to say anything bad about it. I waned to love this film, the trailer had me laughing so hard and Kevin Spacey is my man, he's one of my favorite actors in the world, but I guess when you have a story that falls flat, you can't help that. Now I'm just going to say that it's a rental, while it's not a great movie like everyone was expecting, I don't think it was worth the theater price. But I will compliment on some things, the cast does have pretty good chemistry and where I think it should have concentrated more was on the interesting relationship between Clooney and McGregor, their chemistry worked so well and it was funny to see how McGregor would react to these stories. Also it gets more funny when he wants to be a psychic soldier too and that he has possibilities and powers to do so. I think the flashbacks on how Clooney became a soldier were interesting, but it didn't keep the movie strong. Good cast, good effort, just not a hit though like it should have been.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I really wanted to like this movie, with its stellar cast and creative and quirky concept. Featuring Ewan MacGregor, George Clooney and Kevin Spacey (who's been gone for far too long) I imagined a blend of ""Big Fish,"" ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""Burn After Reading,"" all of which were slightly self-indulgent but more than made up for it with the multi-layered characters, production values, and engaging plot lines. This film had all of the intellectual smugness of those movies but none of the wit. It wanders directionless and completely fails to engage, not just a stream of consciousness but a series of puddles. The characters are shallow, dull stereotypes -- Jeff Daniels as the New Age hippie (and the most nails-on-a-chalkboard irritating of them all), Ewan MacGregor the intrigued naive, George the straight-faced convert. The idea of conducting a war through the use of questionable psychic abilities could have been anywhere from laugh-out-loud funny to well-played dark comedy, and indeed, it seems that the movie tries for the entire range of comic effect, but it doesn't succeed in any. If you're dying to see the comic stylings of George Clooney, try the classic ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (or the aforementioned ""Burn After Reading,"" which features the wonderful Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt as a dim personal trainer)."

While there he encounters Lyn Cassidy, played by George Clooney (Burn After Reading, Ocean's Eleven), who claims to be a psychic for the U.S. Army who is on a secret mission. The two travel together through Iraq as Cassidy uses his psychic abilities to send them in the ""correct"" direction for his mission. <br/><br/>The movie alternates back and forth between the main story and a story of Cassidy's past and how be came a psychic for the Army. Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Iron Man) plays the Army Commander who leads Cassidy and the other psychics. Also playing a large role in Cassidy's past is Larry Hooper, played by Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, The Usual Suspects), who is also a psychic for the Army and becomes a bit of a rival to Cassidy.<br/><br/>The actors and the quirkiness of the story is what makes this film a must see for fans of the dark comedy genre. Both Clooney and Bridges have excelled in this genre before with ""Burn After Reading"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" respectively and do not disappoint here. Twists and turns in the plot always seem right around the corner, and while they happen less than would be desired, when they do happen they happen with authority and impeccable timing. Oh, and there's even an ""intense"" scene with the psychic Cassidy taking on a goat in a staring contest. What more could you want?<br/><br/>One thing that is on-going in the film that grows old quickly is the code name for the Army psychics, Jedi warriors. It almost feels as if the joke was included due to McGregor's involvement in the film, and there's just something strange about McGregor playing a character who has no idea what a Jedi warrior is (he played Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi in Episodes 1-3 of the Star Wars films). <br/><br/>Overall, however, this movie delivers exactly what someone interested in going to see it would expect going in. Good character acting, funny scenes, and hilarious dialogue. The run-time of 94 minutes is close to perfect to keep people interested in the story, and will even seem too short for those who get really drawn into it.

The opening of this movie says 'more of this is true than you would believe', have having seen it, I am inclined to agree.<br/><br/>The hero is a journalist, Bob Wilton (Ewen MacGregor), who discovers his wife having an affair with his boss, and does what all jilted lovers have done throughout history - he goes to war - in Iraq. While having a drink at his hotel in Kuwait, he meets up with Lyn Cassidy (George Cloony), a contractor who has come to Iraq to assist with reconstruction, but he quickly discovers that Cassidy is more than he seems, and thus he embarks on an adventure that takes him across Iraq and into a secret American base.<br/><br/>While this movie is about Wilton's adventure in Iraq, and his freeing of a number of prisoners (and a herd of goats), there is more to this movie than this. In fact it retells the story of a secret, elite, unit of the American Army called the New Earth Army. It was first formed by Bill Django who, while in Vietnam, discovered that it was human nature not to want to kill a fellow human being, so with the Army's blessing, he goes on a research trip into the hippy subculture of California to see if there is a way to harness this power. The result is a unit focused on psychic warfare using powers such as remote viewing, amongst others. However, the more sinister aspects of the American government, in the form of Larry Hooper (Keven Spacey), alienates Django and turns the New Earth Army into a more offensive unit. As the movie mentions at the beginning, more of this is true than you would believe. While most of the characters are based on composites of real people, it is not surprising that the American Military experimented with psychic warfare (as did the CIA and the KGB - anything to get an advantage over their rivals). In fact, this is nothing new, world powers have been delving into the supernatural since before recorded history. We know that the Romans and the Greeks would seek oracles before battle, and would also resort to sorcery in an attempt to win. While our modernist, scientific worldview has no room for such concepts, it does not mean that it is not true. In fact it is said that one of Satan's tactics is to convince people that he does not exist. While I believe that such powers do exist (and the bible does not hide the fact that people practised sorcery back in the days that it was written), it does not necessarily mean that the powers behind them are benevolent. My warning would be to stay away, for there are many things that we humans do not understand, and while we may believe we are in control, we probably are not."
"narrator56","8","3","4","13 May 2019"," Not bad - more subtle than I expected with the big name actors.
","I owned this DVD for quite a while before I finally got around to watching it. Considering the star power here (Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey) I can understand why people might feel somewhat disappointed when they watch it. I mean, the description even mentions the Coen brothers as a basis for comparison. With Jeff Bridges' role, it was difficult not to think of The Big Lebowski, but this film isn't of that caliber.<br/><br/>Still, I thought it was entertaining most of the time. There were slow interludes that could have been removed to improve the pacing without harming the story. But if you understand that they aren't going for laugh out loud gags or one-liners, but rather they work for their punch lines or leave you to figure out where the joke is, maybe you can appreciate it more.<br/><br/>I will say that the plot seemed a bit disjointed to me. The flashbacks weren't confusing, but in a slower paced film like this one, I think they were sometimes more of a distraction than plot-enhancers. The ending also had an air of an anticlimax to it, like - oh, okay. I guess it fit the laid back mood of the rest of the movie, but they might have done more with it.<br/><br/>Still, I liked it. Enough said."

","The Men Who Stare At Goats is an entertaining film as you're watching it, but, after it's over, you really don't know what to make of it all. Most of the time I spent wondering how much of it is based on actual events. This movie dances between sharp political satire and Coen-brothers-style farce. It doesn't really go anywhere, but the ride is fun."
"timdalton007","8","3","4","19 February 2016"," Stranger Than Fiction
","There is an old saying that truth is stranger than fiction. It is perhaps no surprise then that filmmakers have often found inspiration in true events in bringing stories to the screen. In what is definitely a case of ""stranger than fiction"" is The Men Who Stare At Goats, the 2009 film depicting the military's attempt to harness the forces of the paranormal in the name of national security. The results, like the film itself, are quite surprising.<br/><br/>Going into the film, it's worth remembering that the credits state that it is ""Inspired By The Book The Men Who Stare at Goats by Jon Ronson"". Like many a fact based film before it the film combines characters, events and locations together to create something that can fit more easily into a ninety-three minute package. Keeping that in mind though doesn't mean that the film is a complete work of fiction. On the contrary, many of the events shown in the film have a serious basis in reality. These include the New Earth Army, remote viewing programs (including the specific example used in the film) and indeed the film's very title. While the more ""present day"" elements are certainly more fictitious than other parts of the film, the film largely portrays real events within its more fictional context.<br/><br/>Keeping all that in mind, there's plenty of enjoy about the film as a whole. The performances throughout are solid, playing up the absurd nature of the events being portrayed. Ewan McGregor as Bob Wilton (a character apparently inspired by author Jon Ronson"" is the viewer's in-way to events and acts as narrator as well as participant. George Clooney is Lyn Cassady with whom McGregor's Wilton spends much of his time with and whom we see through decades of his life in a performance that Clooney plays perfectly on the fine line that constantly leaves Wilton and the viewer alike wondering about his sanity. Much the same can be said of Jeff Bridges as the New Earth Army's founder Bill Django (based on the real-life Jim Channon) and which Bridges is perfectly cast to play. The film's supporting cast is strong as well including Kevin Spacey, Stephen Lang, Robert Patrick, Stephen Root and Waleed Zuaiter who all play up or down the comedy in their scenes to great success.<br/><br/>The film, as a production, is solid as well. Peter Straughan's script finds the right balance of parody, comedy and occasional seriousness which sets much of the film's tone and that director Grant Heslov brings to the screen wonderfully. The film covers a large span of time from 1972 Vietnam to 2004 Iraq, a challenge that production designer Sharon Seymour and costumer Louise Frogley do a splendid job of bringing to life. If Straughan and Heslov create a quirky sense of tone, it's Seymour and Frogley who give it the sense of reality that makes it all the more incredible to watch. <br/><br/>The result is a quirky, odd but definitely funny hour and a half. With an excellent cast and solid production values, it brings us the tale of the absurd measures that members of the US military went to test and use the paranormal with often surprising results. While not perhaps for all tastes, The Men Who Stare At Goats does prove one thing: that truth is more certainly stranger than fiction."

","The Men Who Stare at Goats is a great movie with a really well developed and extremely unique and unusual storyline and a fantastic cast that all play characters that are different to what you would usually see them in.The best performance has to be George Clooney's, I'm seen him in several comedies but thus is the first time that I genuinely found him to be the funniest character in the movie,Ewan McGregor,Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey also deliver great performances. Fans of both war and comedy movies should definitely check out the Men Who Stare at Goats.<br/><br/>A journalist may have found the story of a lifetime when he meets a man who was part of the US Army who claims he has been professionally trained to gain super powers."
"glila","8","4","6","31 January 2015"," Pleasantly surprised by quirky, confusing film
","Before watching this movie I had to do some research on it and the results were not pretty. A 51% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 6.3 on here says a lot about a film. I did however read multiple reviews that the confusing and hard to follow story was supported by a noble cast including Ewan McGregor, George Clooney, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. This seems very much like the kind of movie I would like and I did like it. I thought that it was going to be a lot less funny than it actually was. It was marketed as a comedy yet was very dramatic, and the humor was dark. I know this bothers a lot of people but I like it. Overall I had very low standards and I was pleasantly proved wrong by a quirky, confusing, well casted romp with some more dark moments you don't expect to find in a comedy."
"LeonLouisRicci","8","4","6","22 May 2013"," ""More of this is True than You would Believe""
","All this Psychic Warrior/Psi-Ops stuff in this cutting-edge Satire is a fact. It has been documented that the Military spent 20 years and over 20 Million Dollars funding and exploring the reported abilities of self identified Remote Viewers. Controversial and often ridiculed by those who have not done their homework or are close minded, this program had many successes.<br/><br/>This Movie is based on a book about such participants and is a wacky, satirical take on these mind-bending facts. It is done with a sort of reverence that at the same time pokes fun at the subject. It is, in reality, unconventional, mysterious, and on the fringe. That can lead to some bizarre and remarkable situations.<br/><br/>It is a light-hearted and quirky romp, full of interesting situations and dark, deadpan humor, mixed with some slapstick and over the top titillation. Not for everyone's taste and it does help to have some background on the topic exploited here to enjoy completely. Casual viewers will probably find it mildly entertaining but the enlightened may enter Nirvana."

","They say the U.S. Government tortured Iraqi prisoners by making them listen to the 'Barney' theme song. Funny. I used to stay up late at night watching 'Barney' videos on my VCR that I recorded earlier in the day. I was able to do that a lot of nights for a couple of years, so what drives one person nuts....But then again I was totally stoned and sometimes on Acid and Shrooming so maybe that gave me some kind of immunity or something.<br/><br/>This was a really cool film. and really funny. George Clooney,a.k.a The Fantastic Mr.Fox,has flicked his bushy tail once more and given another really good performance in another really good movie.<br/><br/>I didn't think this movie was as good as 'Burn After Reading',but it showed a lot of Coen bros. influence in it. and it was almost as good. Maybe even a little funnier because it was weirder. Did the Army really think you could kill a goat by staring at it? Jeez.Thought they were stupid, but...."
"setvice","7","4","6","22 February 2010"," Bizarre psychedelic and totally worthwhile!
","This is truly a bizarre film, and if you are looking for a satisfying and well structured Narrative you will be sorely disappointed. However if you open your mind and allow your imagination to flow freely with the directors, then you will surely enjoy this psychedelic, progressive mind trip.<br/><br/>Its not a war film, its a buddy film that uses War as its backdrop. The constant LSD references perhaps give the audience a clue that this is in fact a trip within a trip. Maybe the story is a mans escape into his own imagination to avoid navigating a broken heart. Perhaps the characters in the story are the types of men that Bob Wilten (mcGregors character) wishes he was in order to better deal with his failed relationship and the story is merely a way of keeping his own mind occupied in order to shutout the pain of loosing his girlfriend to his editor. Its too lazy to be considered a political satire and too weird to be considered a vanilla comedy, although there are plenty of jokes and slapstick thrown into the mix. All of which serve to spice up this very funny movie. For every joke you miss or don't get, there will be someone in the theater that does. It's nice to be in a cinema and hear laughter come from different parts of the room at different times. Kind of like a surround sound laughter track. <br/><br/>The acting is superb from everyone and its pure joy to see Jeff bridges almost revive his 'dude' character from ""The Big Lebowski"", and equally fun to watch Clooney use everything he learned from the Cohen brothers to spectacular effect. As if the title wasn't enough to give it away ""The men who stare at goats"" is a bizarre film that has enough depth for multiple viewings and i believe it will be appreciated a little more when the desert dust settles."

","I have never considered walking out of a film before but for most of the film I was contemplating doing just that! <br/><br/>The film had so much potential, hence why after reading the films premise I was excited to see the film. The trailer made the film look good but all of the funniest parts were in the trailer, so my advice is to watch the trailer and not bother with this boring comedy. George Clooney is great at playing cool characters but his role in this film requires him to be a buffoon which he is neither funny or enjoyable to watch- It actually makes him look like a crap actor. Ewan McGregor is his normal overacting self, living in the shadow of his only good performance as Renton in 'Trainspotting.' I really wonder why he is still cast in big roles! <br/><br/>A great cast with a poor script that should have been so much better. However I can see how this film might have looked good on paper but a lack of development, it seems, left the film with too many flaws.<br/><br/>My advice- Watch the trailer and burn any copies you see lying around at friends houses (only joking) but don't watch this film, it is a big old mess!"

Every time I want to the cinema, I saw the trailer & I simply freaked out. I was so excited that I could hardly watch the movie that came after the trailer...and then, one day...BAM! I watched the movie, I watched The Men Who Stare at Goats. And that's all, I simply watched it. I just went through it the way you eat your meal while looking at the fascinating dessert every 5 seconds, all the time I just wanted it to end so I could find something more useful to do than watching the worst comedy I had watched for the last few months. The movie is...uhm...stupid? Yeah, it's simply & clearly STUPID. The jokes are lame, the story is stupid & they overacted with all that Jedi-warrior crap. I can hardly believe that the movie actually made some people laugh, because I saw only few really funny scenes & they were not that good at all. Possibly I wasn't in the mood for that movie, but still, it was a huge disappointment & I never believed it could be so bad. Was it because of my huge expectations or because of the huge promises they gave me with the trailer, I don't know, but I didn't enjoy the movie at all. My suggestion is not to expect anything from this movie & it might actually satisfy you, but still, I think you should pass if you have anything good for watching."
"roger_mr_thomas","4","6","11","18 November 2009"," Sadly, a terrible film
","Despite the cast and promising beginnings, the film loses its way about 40 minutes in; and there is quite a lot wrong with it really. The story is told through flashbacks, except the narrator (Ewan McGregor) is not the owner of the flashback (Clooney), which was a real problem for me (you keep wondering how McGregor knows all this detail if he wasn't there). The story itself meanders along self-consciously, with one or two decent laughs along the way; however it is very disjointed; the psychic military unit is somewhat lame (the trial scene in the trailer is the best bit to be honest) and then for reasons not made clear Kevin Spacey's character is supposed to be playing a major part in the plot development, but you never really get to understand why. Possibly there are a lot of 'in' military jokes, but if so I didn't get them. The trip into Iraq is more like something from a sketch show, with a nice little satire on private US contractors (but so what) and then what seems like a lot of footage to fill time until you get to the psychic unit's encampment. The ending is frankly ridiculous (why don't they fly off into the sunset...that's a good idea...). Anyone expecting a film to compare with the Cohen brothers should look elsewhere, despite the great cast. What were they thinking of when they agreed to star in this very average film?"

We thought we were going to something with the sophistication and clever humour of the Oceans series, but instead got something campy and largely lacking in plot.<br/><br/>There were moments of genuine humour in the movie that did make us laugh, which is why I've gone as high as five on my review. However, the movie as a whole never gave us what we had hoped. I suspect the actors probably got more amusement from making the film that we got from watching it; I felt like I was watching an inside joke or I was the sober person watching drunk people amused at their own antics.<br/><br/>I like these actors, but I expect more of them."
"KineticSeoul","6","8","17","8 November 2009"," Well I liked the overall theme, it had some great ideas but can't say the same about the execution
","This movie is based on a true story, but over exaggerated and a lot of it is made up. Well supposedly there is a special section of the government that works with psychic warfare. A reporter Bob Wilton(Ewan McGregor) who is fired from his last job and is dumped by his girl friend and has a very dull life ahead of him, gets a opportunity to go on a life changing journey when he goes to Iraq and report in order to prove himself. When he stumbled onto a special forces operator, Lyn Cassady(George Clooney) and decides to get a story out of it instead of the war in Iraq. Since Lyn Cassady supposedly has the powers of a Jedi Knight and they milk this joke for everything it got. Anyways from there Lyn Cassady's past is revealed when he was still working with psychic warfare and how he was the golden boy of the trainings and operations, while they go on a wacky unknown mission in Iraq. And while this is going on Bob Wilton is trying to figure out if Lyn Cassady is being legit or not. The parts where theses supposedly psychic soldiers try to demonstrate remote viewing and the power to kill something such as hamsters and goats by just staring at it, was actually pretty hysterical to watch. Like I said before there is a lot of Jedi jokes thrown in which is funny and repetitive but didn't feel that tedious. I also liked the direction where they went with this, where it isn't sure if Lyn Cassady is a telling the truth about his powers or if he is just nuts. I am sure he was nuts in the story and most of the audiences will agree, but I liked the direction they went with this. However it just wasn't that satisfying when it was finished since it lack the edgy to it, and went the more indie style comedy and it doesn't seem like the movie knew which direction to go with either. So I liked the overall theme and had some great ideas, but can't say the same about the execution.<br/><br/>6.9/10"

I hope that Goats + Inglorious Basterds win every award this year as we really haven't been spoiled recently. I recently met a couple who didn't like The Big Lebowski (nor The Royal Tenenbaums for the matter), yet they seemed so normal to me. I daren't suggest this film to them. They should stick to Dumb and Dumber methinks... Anyhoo, I agree with The Irish Times: ""Clooney shines in this remarkable story, based on actual events...Clooney is now pretty much the sole bearer of the 'classic movie star' tag, and once again, he injects a performance with a Coen brothers level of quirky.

","I rarely write reviews of films during their initial release (I think the last time I did so was for 2008's The Dark Knight), but if my words can inspire anyone to go and see The Men Who Stare at Goats they will be words well spent. Or something. Simply put, this is the best military-themed comedy since Buffalo Soldiers, and thankfully the Fort Hood shootings haven't done for Goats what 9/11 did for Buffalo. The film can be appreciated on a number of levels: for its superb ensemble cast (Bridges, Clooney, McGregor, Spacey, and Robert Patrick), as absurdist comedy, or as a sharply critical indictment of the immorality and stupidity of American foreign policy. If you think the invasion of Iraq was a good idea, you probably won't like this film.

"Quinoa1984","8","8","18","6 November 2009"," a Jedi feeling
","The Men Who Stare at Goats. Just look at that title for a moment. If you knew nothing at all about this movie- didn't know it was about psychic spies (aka ""The First Earth Battalion"") who trained to use peaceful means against their enemies, or that it starred three of the finest American actors working (Clooney, Bridges, Spacey) and a Scottsman (McGregor), or that it was a comedy ""mostly based on truth believe it or not""- wouldn't the title just jut out at you? In a way the title is like many of the things that we as the audience come across as we're meant to be with McGregor's journalist character - there's something unbelievable going on, but we have to go along with it, just for a little while. And yet at the same time it's also silly, but it knows its silly. The Men Who Stare at Goats sounds equally official and like a new-wave 80's pop band parody, who may or may not actually stare at goats in order to stop their hearts with their minds.<br/><br/>This is, for the most part, an astonishing comedy of the absurd told with a straight face. I was laughing through most of it in some part because of the performances (Clooney as an ex ""Jedi"" who was one of the best and brightest of the First Earth Battalion is about as deadpan as we've ever seen him, and Bridges comes off like The Dude from the Big Lebowski with more spiritual discipline as a leader), how all of the major players worked off one another and made themselves truthful and honest even when saying or doing ridiculous things like yoga in a desert or gaining energy through the power of dance.<br/><br/>But the other thing that makes the movie so brilliant is its style. This is a gonzo comedy, but it's in the subject matter. First time director Grant Heslov doesn't do anything too crazy with the style of the camera or editing (save maybe for Clooney ""projecting"" himself through the sky while listening to Boston's ""More Than a Feeling""), so we see it with the same straight face that someone like Bob from Ann Arbor Michigan Press would see it. Or, for that matter, while reading the book, which is based on a real psychic squad of soldiers in a (now semi) secret program run by the US government. Whether or not the soldiers really could run through walls by focusing hard enough or see what was inside of metal containers or if Angela Lansbury knew where Noriega was or if a scrotum could... OK, perhaps I've said too much, what matters is just that they believed it, and it became more like religion than warfare.<br/><br/>It's a farce loaded with dry and high wit, and infectious performances. There's some dark moments as well, like with Clooney's Lyn with his crisis of his being with killing that goat (i.e. how can he be redeemed and will he die from being touched with an ancient martial arts move, or something else I wouldn't spoil just for story sake), but its really about seeing these people in the nature of a subversive system within a system. It's got a touch of the Dr. Strangelove to it, not reaching its satirical heights but emulating it just enough to branch off and do its own thing. That, plus a fitting homage to those psychedelic B movies of the 60s where, as the climax, there's just lots and lots of tripping (again, seen through the camera with a clear eye and mind), makes it almost poignant. Almost, that is, if one weren't laughing their head off, which I did quite a lot. <br/><br/>Overall, it's a minor riot, particularly if you can't get enough of Jedi ""jokes"", uproarious running gag style, around a dumbfounded Ewan McGregor."

Clooney has done controlled manic before, and Spacey is doing his serious ""bad"" guy routine. McEwan is along for the ""not comedy"" angle, and he gets to pick up his pay check and move on.<br/><br/>As the Army seriously went down this path we should leave the movie, sadder, but wiser.

The film's attempt at humor was sophomoric and in the realm of the absurd, but it was too stupid to make it there. What was the underlying meaning? None. Was it an anti-military film? If it was, then it was a disaster. Not meaningful, not fun, not even silly. Jeff Bridges must feel embarrassed because he did just that, embarrass himself. Kevin Spacy, one of my favorite actors, was awful. He looked terrible, puffy, out of shape, squinty eyes, like he was hung over. I felt bad for him. It was his first terrible acting performance. I waited for something to happen. Nothing does. Nothing happens. This is a film for those who go to a terrible restaurant and have a terrible meal with terrible service, and then go out and tell everyone how great it was."

","I'm sorry but This movie had no plot, no comedy, no nothing that would make me sit through it again. I thought with Geoge Clooney and Kevin Spacey, something had to be good about this film. All the hype about a comedy and how Clooney was at his funniest, Where? I heard a couple of giggles and made one myself at a comment he made, but I have not seen a good comedy in years. Somebody tell me why this was funny. 3 Movies this week that I really wanted to see, and all 3 were nowhere close to what I expected them to be. Don't see this movie if you want to laugh, you will not. Clooney's funniest movie to me would be Oh Brother where art thou. If you agree with me on that, you might as well believe me about this. I think they threw in a small piece of nudity to get an R rating, to get more viewers. I know now why they had such a weird title for this film. It's because there wasn't a plot to write about. They picked one scene near the end of the film to get this title. Hooray for the Marketing and paid off critics to get $10.00 out of me. Glad I made it to the Early show. It could have been worse. Clooney, come on; give us something better than this or I'm done with your movies."

","You know the movie is bad when the best part is the title. After the credits ran it was downhill after that. I don't know about most people but I generally like my movies to have a plot. It doesn't have to be much of a plot but some plot would be a plus. When they green-lit this film I wonder what they saw in the script that did not make it on the screen. You have to work pretty hard to make a crappy movie with such a talented cast. What a shame. Done properly this subject would have made a very entertaining film. One day after viewing this film I was asked to summarize it for a friend who was thinking of going and was at a total loss for words. The trailer for the new Mel Gibson film was more entertaining."

","This film is easily the worst film I have seen this year. I read the user comments and decided to give it a go, I was expecting a comedy, maybe a parody, something easy and absurdly funny at the same time.<br/><br/>I didn't laugh once during the whole film, and even FF'd the last 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The characters are not funny, mostly because the script lacks intelligence. The whole crazy army soldiers thing has no sense, or maybe is that i'm from Europe and we don't have that army culture. But Clint Eastwood made me laugh with army films, and I love Cohen brothers ironic and absurd sense of humor.<br/><br/>For some reason half of the film consist on telling us about stuff that happened before, just talking about it, as this film was some kind of video-book. And not just because you present a weird situation on the screen makes it funny.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm confused, and isn't intended to be a comedy? <br/><br/>I didn't get this film, I thought it was terrible!"
"MaxBorg89","8","6","13","9 November 2009"," Now more than ever, we need the Jedi...
","The first, basic appeal of Grant Heslov's war comedy The Men Who Stare at Goats lies in the title: silly, amusing and just about unique enough to grab attention. Add a director with a solid reputation - he's George Clooney's producing partner and co-wrote the excellent Good Night, and Good Luck - and a stellar cast (Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, plus terrific support from established character actors like Stephen Root, Robert Patrick and Glenn Morshower), and you've got all the right ingredients for a smart piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Based on Welsh journalist Jon Ronson's non-fiction book (a story ""more true than you would believe"", according to the movie's opening caption), the film focuses primarily on the misadventures of Ronson's on-screen alter ego, the American Bob Wilton (McGregor, doing his finest accent work since Big Fish), a reporter who has gone off to a war-ridden Iraq to prove to his ex-wife that he is, in fact, a real man. Prior to his travel, he recounts his meeting with a former soldier (Root) who claimed to have been part of an unusual army unit. The story is confirmed when Wilton meets the disgraced Lyn Cassady (Clooney), who was once the most promising element of said unit: the New Earth army, a covert division born from the idea of a Vietnam veteran, Bill Django (Bridges), who believed it would be easier to win wars by resorting to the power of the mind, hence the recruitment of soldiers who were supposedly able to accomplish such feats as walking through solid walls and stopping a heart simply by staring at the subject (the hilarious titular scene). The unit was disbanded following the scheme of one Larry Hooper (Spacey), but now it appears to have resurfaced, and Cassady is headed to a new mission. Anything can happen...<br/><br/>The Men Who Stare at Goats works because it walks that fine line between amusingly serious and seriously zany without ever disrupting the balance between the two. Backed up by the fact that this is a (mostly) true story, it is therefore a film that manages to provoke huge laughs while at the same time cause reflections on the weird nature of America's participation in conflicts (the use of the Barney the Dinosaur theme song as a torture device was reportedly inspired by events depicted in the movie). The satire, while never specifically aimed at one element of the US government (although Ronald Reagan is mentioned at one point, to good effect), follows the example of Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove in that it never paves the way for outright silliness, barring the final 20 minutes which appear to have been conceived as a mere means to end the film (this is most obvious in the final shot which, funny as it may be, leaves a bit of a sour aftertaste).<br/><br/>The movie also works admirably as a straightforward comedy, thanks to instantly quotable lines (see Django's trial), clever cinematic winks (the New Earth Army men are called ""Jedi warriors"") and spot-on performances: McGregor, saddled with the seemingly ungrateful task of playing the ""regular"" guy, is a perfect vessel for the audience, enabling us to marvel at the sight of Clooney's terrific combination of smart and dumb, Bridges (sort of) resurrecting ""The Dude"" Lebowski via his hippie approach to warfare and Spacey adding a brilliant comedic shade to his traditional villainous persona. Not one false note when these people are around.<br/><br/>To sum it up, The Men Who Stare at Goats is a very thoughtful, insightful comedy, which boasts great ideas without forgetting to bring laughs along for the ride. Oh, and former Star Wars hero McGregor asking ""What's a Jedi?"" just has to be the year's best in-joke."

The movie is insane, wacky, but has some very slow moments here and there. This movie is whacked out, and at least has an original story premise. Jeff Bridges plays a cross between Hunter S Thompson and Maynard G. Krebs. He convinces the Army that they should start a ""New Earth"" army where ""Jedi"" fight the enemy with their minds.

","""Men Who Stare at Goats"" is a sweet, lighthearted, fun movie. I laughed out loud and I heard others in the theater laughing, as well. This account of a secret army program whose goal is to train men to use the psychic power of their minds to defeat their enemies, or to kill goats, claims to be true; I have no idea if it is. In any case, the cast is just perfect. George Clooney has never been so sexy and so funny, and also so poignant; it's amazing he can be all three at the same time. Ewan MacGregor is perfect as his wide-eyed apprentice. No one does suave evil as well as Kevin Spacey – although Claude Reins could have given him a run for his money. It would be so cool to be able to see them both in a film at the same time. Spacey does seem a bit disengaged; he's so good at suave evil, he could just phone it in. But he's still Spacey. Jeff Bridges is an older, fatter, uniformed version of the Dude from the Big Lebowski. This isn't a deep, profound, or memorable movie. It's just deadpan fun and cute."

I enjoy films that run the gamut from Casablanca to Hangover. I enjoy all types of movies and thought this one might be good based on who made it and the actors involved.

"dogfish_3","6","7","16","8 November 2009"," Boy, are the 60's back.
","This movie is another 60's-era nostalgia piece for elderly ""new-age""-ers, complete with a pipe-dream fantasy of their final triumph. Hollywood just can't get enough of this market segment, in part because ""the Age of Aquarius"" fits so nicely with their political agenda.<br/><br/>With that said, ""Goats"" is a decent-enough movie, and is much more watchable than most of the recent breathless Hollywood editorials. It's at its best when it's poking a little fun at some of the loonier extremes of the New Age Movement, but it lacks energy - they are the gentle, loving pokes that might be given to a cherished grandmother who let the bathtub run over. As far as grandmom goes, it would be hard to see anyone much under 55 really being that into this movie, and it is extremely careful not to offend that crowd. Possibly because of this, it lacks the energy of better satire. It's propped up in part by some solid individual performances, but generally feels listless and limp.<br/><br/>Overall, it would make a good companion piece to that other goat, ""Hair,"" in a before-and-after kind of way."
"SusanHampson","6","7","16","7 November 2009"," Trippy, Hippy and very Dippy
","This film is one hippy dippy trip. The train leaves from Optimism Junction; journeying full steam ahead through Laughter Lane; then it chugs along comfortably through Madcap Mount. You will be awestruck at the scenery but after about an hour you'll stall at Boredom Boulevard and be held there for a bit too long. You will then pootle along Bizarre Broadway and all of a sudden you'll be launched to the ultimate destination, Unexpected Parkway. Your trip is now complete: you have just watched 'The Men Who Stare at Goats'.<br/><br/>Okay, so it's got its good points: George Clooney, Ewan McGregor and Jeff Bridges to name a few. The chemistry between them works very well. McGregor plays Bob Wilton, a hapless journalist who is trying to prove to his estranged wife that he's not a loser. George Clooney plays Lyn Cassady, an ex-soldier on a secret mission to Iraq. Lyn has psychic powers and has devoured new age philosophy as if his life depended on it. Jeff Bridges is Bill Django, the ultimate guru who trains the soldiers in all things mystic.<br/><br/>So Bob tags on to Lyn in pursuit of a hot story and winds up in Iraq with one deluded dude. The realisation of this is rammed home when they are kidnapped by Al-Qaeda terrorists and Lyn suggests astral flight as a means of escape. Earth to loony Clooney. However, Bob does end up writing about the New Earth Army soldiers who drink wheatgrass for breakfast, meditate at lunchtime and pick up sacks with unusual parts of their body come nightfall. It's all a bit surreal. The kookiness climaxes when Lyn demonstrates that he can kill a goat just by an intense stare from those night-time eyes. I can think of worse ways to go.<br/><br/>Jeff Bridges has never looked so becoming even though he is sporting a long blonde plait that would make a German hausfrau proud. His anthem Earth Prayer is a really catchy number and delivered with such panache: ""Mother Earth my life support system as a soldier I must drink your blue water live inside your red clay and eat your green skin."" Eat your green skin? I hope Princess Fiona isn't listening.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey plays Larry Hooper who's also a psychic soldier but a mean one. It's an interesting turn for Spacey who doesn't get much screen time but he's not known for nasty roles and isn't very convincing as a meanie. No amount of glaring can harden his soft face but I can see why he took the role.<br/><br/>All in all, this film's a bit difficult to pigeon-hole. If you crossed Ansel Adams with a whole lot of silliness, this is what you would get. It has beautiful cinematography; sophisticated camera work; and beautiful shots of the desert. It's so stylish, you almost expect Lawrence of Arabia to charge across the dunes. Instead you get Lyn and Bob bickering about the joys of soya: new age nutter meets hacked-off hack. The friction between the two main characters works but the plot is just a wee bit dull in the middle. Overall, the expression 'mad as a box of (organic) frogs' springs to mind."

","The Men Who Stare At Goats (2009: Dir: Grant Heslov / Cast: Ewan McGregor, George Clooney, Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Stephen Lang: Here is a comedy that combines both sincerity and among the biggest laughs all year. Ewan McGregor plays Bob Wilton whose life is on a downward spiral until he encounters a believed super soldier named Lynn Cassidy, played by George Clooney. What is interesting here is how full of crap Cassidy is yet our willingness to go along because Cassidy believes it so well. These super soldiers have a psychic ability that allows them to move objects by force of the mind. Jeff Bridges plays Bill Django who nearly died in Vietnan until he found refuge in a strange vision. Kevin Spacey plays Larry Hooper who attempts to sabotage the operation because he desires to control it for himself. Directed by Grant Heslov who creates one of the funniest as well as best films of the year. McGregor allows us to believe the nonsense because he can stare through a wall for that awesome triumphant conclusion. Clooney sharpens his comic edge with a wink. Bridges steals moments in his hippy madness. Spacey even makes for a villain we cannot help but like even when he pulls a gun on himself. Stephen Lang opens up the film with a hilarious sequence where he believes that he can transport through walls. Intelligent comedy about secret government exploitations. Score: 10 / 10"

","Though the overall narrative might be a little on the weak side, I found it more than a little entertaining, definitely a hilarious portrayal of history. I'm usually not a fan of movies that are based on actual events, as they often change the truth too much to make the story work (which this film certainly does) I thought the manner in which it examines the history of this unusual chapter of history was suiting to the subject matter, and was interesting as a piece of fiction that draws upon fact. As an adaptation, I'm sure many things have been changed from how they really were (or were presented in the book for that matter), and since I've never read the book and don't know much about the history I can say only that this film, at the very least, made me interested to know more. All told, it was a funny, interesting story that I felt was definitely worth the time."

"jon503","6","3","5","23 January 2010"," I'm gonna go with 'interesting'
","I was thinking for a minute about how to caption this movie, and as you can see, I went with 'interesting', that wonderful word you can use when you really don't know what to make of something but want to be polite. I'm not just being polite though, it really was interesting. The movie was advertised as a comedy, and the basic premise clearly sets it up in this manner. Yet despite its often quirky, sometimes hilarious moments, the movie seems conflicted as to what it sets out to be. There are some allusions to controversial practices of the US military such as those seen in Abu Ghraib which had me trying to interpret the movie as a satirical depiction of military transgressions. Such critique is not pointed enough to amount to a real persiflage, however. The result was not so much a thought-provoking comedy, perhaps the intended effect, but rather a movie where the viewer is tempted to over-intellectualize about its purpose while watching it - not a good sign.<br/><br/>As to the performances, the acting was satisfactory, but nobody really shone. Then again, I didn't find any of the characters to be complex enough to inspire or require above-average acting. Even though he is an accomplished actor easily up to the task, I kept wondering whether Ewan McGregor was cast simply because he was Obi-Wan Kenobi in the new Star Wars movies, or whether that was just an added bonus for the director to play with. Either way, I'm afraid they overdid the Jedi references, which were funny at most the first two or three times.<br/><br/>These flaws notwithstanding, the movie is interesting because it really makes you want to jump on Wikipedia and check out what is known about the actual US Army Psy-Ops project (which I'm going to do after writing this review, I know I've heard that the staring at goats actually happened). I definitely did not regret watching this movie, though I do not know whether I would have gone to see it in the theater if I'd known what it was like. I recommend catching it on pay-per-view or renting it at blockbuster."

The cast is pretty terrific in this film, I wish that Jeff Bridges could have had a few more scenes. Much of the writing is excellent, and the improv that I could detect worked, mostly.<br/><br/>I could agree with some of the complaints about this movie, the weak ending, not particularly great chemistry between Mac Gregor and Clooney, etc. The Men Who Stare at Goats was made by some very smart and funny people, and even though it was not perfect the few flaws did little to dampen the entertainment value for me. As a straight man, I found the homo-erotic subtext to be pretty funny too.<br/><br/>As well as the laughs, there are some moments of more serious satire. In the case of the Iraq war, which is the setting for about half of the movie, the facts themselves pretty much outdo any satire one could make, and some of that is presented."
"Jackpollins","7","3","5","5 December 2009"," Goes nowhere with big laughs
","One of the many problems with making a weird comedy involving spies or psychics or wars or something in that them, you know, something that about people who fight for a living is that it often feels too weird to be funny. The Men Who Stare At Goats is weird, but it's funny. The film starts out with a journalist named Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) being dumped by his girlfriend when his girlfriend falls for his boss. He decides the only way to get her back is to write the best story ever. His resource is his friend, Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a man who is a psychic who can kill goats with his mind. Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey are especially funny as Lyn's new age mentor, Bill Django, and Lyn and Bill's rival, Larry Hooper, a fellow student psychic. The film is admittedly plot less and pointless. The non-story goes nowhere, but it does so while creating huge laughs. The film is weird, and it will not be for everyone. If you do not enjoy weird films, this is not for you. It is very strange and may too pointless, plot less, and/or slow paced for some. That said, anyone looking for a strange and funny time at the movies that does not require you to use your brain that much, this film is just what you need."

","""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" opens with a sentence on the screen, ""More of this is true than you would believe"", and indeed that seems likely, depending on who you are. It's a glib introduction, but it also has an extra element of self-conscious awareness. The story is so inherently weird and subjective that believing it completely would be somewhat foolish. A movie about this particular series of events couldn't possibly be 100% accurate, and ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" is not a film that is overly concerned with trying to portray historical facts. The opening sentence is a warning for the audience, that things like this can't be perfectly explained.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor plays Bob Wilton, a reporter at a small newspaper in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He finds himself recently cast aside by his wife and in need of distraction, if not complete rebirth. He finds the first, and possibly the second, rather accidentally, in Kuwait City in the form of Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a former Special Ops military man. Bob had recently written a newspaper story about Gus Lacey (Stephen Root), a man who claimed to have psychic powers of his own, as well as knowledge of the US Army's involvement with psychic research and the possible military applications of such capabilities. From that story, Bob recognizes Lyn Cassady's name as someone who was also involved in the program that Lacey described to Bob. Wilton attaches himself to Cassady at this point, and Cassady leads Wilton down the rabbit hole, through the Iraqi desert, and into a crazy world of Military Intelligence, the classic oxymoron.<br/><br/>Cassady explains himself as having been the most successful psychic soldier, a ""Jedi Warrior"", in fact, of a program in the US Army called the New Earth Army. The NEA was the brainchild and proposition to the Army of Bill Django (Jeff Bridges, perfectly cast), a Vietnam veteran and new age hippie. Django is the most unlikely of soldiers, and he guides his troop of men through various exercises to attempt to create a peaceful army for the new millennium, using the power of positive energy, psychic strength, and dancing. Yes, dancing. If the history of this bizarre story is to believed, a group of Army soldiers danced together regularly, in uniform, on a military base, in a free-form style, to rid themselves of inhibition in order to become more powerful soldiers of love and good mojo.<br/><br/>This was back in the 1980's, the Reagan era, and President Reagan himself was said to be a supporter of this kind of research. It seems the Soviets were themselves attempting to employ psychic powers to gain an advantage in the cold war or perhaps to end it, one would assume and our side didn't want to fall behind on a potentially ground-breaking front.<br/><br/>Clooney plays Lyn Cassady sympathetically, as a man convinced of his own supernatural ability and driven by a desire to do good and perhaps help reform the Army, if not the human race, through the techniques and belief system he has committed his existence to. Cassady is not a young idealist any more, as the bulk of the movie takes place in the early part of this decade, years after the New Earth Army has dissolved and given way to the Bush era. The current administration is attempting to use some of the techniques and findings of Django and Cassady for torture and other nefarious practices. You may have heard of the Army using the music of the big purple dinosaur Barney as a torture device against captives in Iraq. That's one of the things that Cassady refers to as part of ""the dark side"". Cassady is an aging idealist, and he sees Bob Wilton as a tool for redemption a man who can tell Cassady's story to the world. Cassady is, in the frame-work of the film, a mystifying figure; insane or brilliant, pathetic or heroic. Clooney deadpans the part as he must, since any over-playing of Cassady's cards would almost certainly betray the man as a buffoon and a liar. And anyway, George Clooney doesn't know any better than you or I do, even after seeing the movie, what is real and what is not.<br/><br/>But that's beside the point, or perhaps it is the point. As Clooney and McGregor (our former Obi-Wan is hilariously confused about the way of the Jedi) tumble through this movie, almost nothing factual becomes clear. We see some desperate men in the process of trying to do some good running up against the standard problems that confront such people the will of those in power who do not concern themselves with morals, but rather attempt to ""succeed"" and ""win"" at any cost. There is a hilarious scene wherein two security companies full of soldiers-for-hire, all of US origin, accidentally find themselves in a firefight sparked by misunderstanding and machismo. It is classically FUBAR (a military term for screwed up), and as Clooney, McGregor and an Iraqi man they have recently befriended skip out of the skirmish (""my house is near here"", says the Iraqi), the message is simple: Fear and aggression are powerful forces that can consume anyone, and good mojo and innocence are easy targets. Sometimes it's best just to get out of the way.<br/><br/>""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" is a sad yet somehow triumphant tale of good persevering over evil, if only in the hearts and minds of a few fairly powerless humans. In our time, in this crazy, mixed-up, violent and fearful world, what else do we have, anyway? Love, dancing, and the movies"

","This is so off the wall, with a number of actors who's shone in Coen comedies, than I can't help feel the film has taken a Coen-inspired approach to the adaptation of the novel - which is probably the only way to make a mainstream-ish comedy from what is a difficult read. Clooney excels here, with a deadpan style more toned down from his unforgettable Everett McGill in O Brother Where Art Thou!, but no less entertaining or convincing. McGregor's accent slips quite frequently and the jedi in-joke wears a bit thin the fourth or fifth time they run it but he's very easy on the eye so that's all forgiven. Jeff Bridges, while not reach ""the dude"" heights, turns in his best performance for several years. The dialogue is at times brilliantly off the wall, the soundtrack rocks, and the running time is about right. My only gripe was with the ending, I found it to be inconclusive and a bit of a cop out, but as gripes go its a minor one."

Everything from its marvellously oddball title to the stellar cast assembled to the tactfully unconventional posters (announcing ""Goat"" as the last star cast member of the film) suggested a gleefully irreverent, strange and wilfully brave film, whether functioning as a military spoof or oddball comedy on its own right. Bearing this in mind, the film is hardly a failure, but runs the risk of feeling like one, largely because none of the tantalizing aforementioned standards of quality are met. Rather, in contrast, the film, while still managing to amuse from time to time, feels excessively safe rather than brave, conventional rather than strange, and lukewarm and gormless rather than gleeful or irreverent.<br/><br/>The main problem is the film's overall hesitancy, as if afraid of alienating audiences by becoming the far out, bizarre comedy it hints at, while equally concerned about pushing too many buttons by poking too much fun at the military - the irony being, both were aims the film promoted itself as meeting, thus suggesting qualities audiences would be interested in seeing in the film. Director Grant Heslov without question plays it safe, consistently hitting a tone comfortably in the midst of mainstream, accessible and friendly comedy (the musical score in particular reeks of familiar comedy cliché riffs) with occasional polite satirical barbs (""the military does some silly things in the name of war, but is ultimately still all right"") being the extent of the film's much hyped exposure or caustic wit. With such a forceful 'anti-bias', the film uneasily dabbles between ridiculing and vaguely supporting the army, making it difficult for the viewer to situate themselves in the equation, and, equally, decide what to laugh at. As such, Heslov's film is far more likely to evoke puzzled glances than chuckles, from viewers just as confused as to exactly what the film is trying to say (not from being clever and hard to understand, but rather inconsistent and vague) as what happened to the advertised film they expected to, and with a more bold director and intelligent script, could have, seen.<br/><br/>As such, the pleasure factor in the film resides solely in its superb cast, who, despite largely being given little to work with, manage to cobble together an amusing romp, albeit one still lacking in fundamental complexity and wit. Despite the questionable quality of the film at hand, one has to tip their hat to George Clooney to committing so wholeheartedly to whatever sparks of comic madness lay in it, as he unleashes his legendary charisma in full force with a welcome side order of manic paranoia and demented intensity as whiz paranormal G.I. Lynn Cassidy. Like Cassidy himself, Clooney's clipped urgency and wide-eyed passion are enough to sell what is largely a very silly and hardly believable story, and it is impossible to imagine the film holding together without his reassuring comic centrepiece of a performance. As the befuddled reporter following Cassidy's story, Ewan McGregor feels wasted, stuck with a thankless 'straight man' role, but manages to draw out several amusing moments nonetheless, many self-reflexively revolving around Cassidy's numerous Jedi references. Nonetheless, the unabashed scene-steal is Jeff Bridges as a flower-child military commander. Refusing to coast alone on either a hippie stereotype or the mere comedic tension of his character, Bridges instead infuses his role with unexpected tragic underpinnings and poignancy, managing to not only be uproariously funny but surprisingly sympathetic and moving. Kevin Spacey also raises numerous chuckles as a petulant, adversarial paranormal soldier, but one cannot help but feel both the role and his rendition of it to fall somewhat below their full potentials.<br/><br/>The film's occasional, fleeting moments of irreverent genius (a particularly wacky ending being none the least of them) suggest an initially far more strange, silly and politically pointed film being disappointingly morphed into a more flaccid, safe substitute somewhere along the line, but such moments and the fun the cast has with them are what ultimately breathe some semblance of life into the overall work. Nonetheless, while it overall proves an amusing, sufficiently interesting and sometimes downright funny watch, there lingers a perpetual sense of vague disappointment circulating around The Men Who Stare at Goats, as if the ghost of the film's far superior potential lingers ever intangible but consistently discernible, like one of Cassidy's psychic premonitions. A worthwhile watch, but far from the triumph it rather easily could have been.<br/><br/>-6.5/10"

","I saw this movie a week ago, and will see it again sometime. In a nut shell, The Men Who Stare at Goats, is an undated and psychedelic version of Joseph Heller's Catch 22, a great book, good read, or vook, (vook a book on CD.) And the movie version of it is OK, provided you allow for it's surreal and crazy nature. But back to TMWSaG. We were talking to a couple at a restaurant this weekend, and asked if they had seen A Serious Man, they said no and were going to see TMWSaG, and asked me about it, if it was any good. I said yes, and added it's about the Hippies taking over the Army. That got a laugh. If you are looking for a point in this movie, don't bother. I recall reading that the CIA and the military actually went in for this mind control business a few decades ago, and had an on going program to explore it as a combat or espionage tool. And perhaps that is what this movie is based on. Any way it's fun."

","The Men Who Stare At Goats is based upon the book of the same name by Jon Ronson. At times the film claims to have parts that are based on a true story, but I think each individual who watches the film will come out of it with a firm opinion on that matter, whether they think it could possibly be true, or the complete and total opposite. I am sure anyone who is interested in the film, or is at least curious about it, has probably seen the film's trailer, or has read movie reviews on it. For that reason I really do not want to talk about the plot of the film because I really do not want to give anything else away that may have already been shown, or talked about in other reviews, or the film's trailer. That being said I was not entirely sure what type of film this would be, or what kind of lasting effect it would have on me, but overall I was pretty satisfied. I definitely have to give the cast and crew credit for making a film like this because it is so bizarre and in many ways brilliantly unique and I am sure that there are enough studios and actors and directors who would pass up this material for that reason, so I definitely admire this cast and crew for going ahead and making a movie like this. Other than being really impressed by the film's unique story (if you can call it that in loose terms), or just by it's style and direction, I also found it to be quite captivating and there were definitely a lot of laugh out loud moments during it and it is definitely not a boring film and again whether you decide what you are watching is true, or the strangest and most unbelievable thing that you have ever heard, or in this case seen, I still guarantee that you will be interested and want to see where the director goes with it. The comedic performances here are all right on target and well done. They do justice to the material as does the director, screenwriter and the music set to the film really emphasizes it's style and the era and state of mind that it is trying to get across. In other words it is well done. At times the film is very ridiculous and as far out there as you can possibly get, but like I said earlier, it is very interesting and makes for quite an entertaining watch. I again applaud the individuals who brought this to the screen, because they have done a film like no other and for that reason alone The Men Who Stare At Goats is worth seeing at least once because it is quite different from any other film this year and stands on it's own for originality and ludicrous humour. Recommended for at least one watch and for those who are curious about it."

","There's a scene early on in The Men Who Stare at goats where hapless General Dean Hopgood (Stephen Lang) attempts a platform 9 & 3 quarters style sprint towards a solid wall, in attempt to use 'psychic abilities' he is being taught at a hush-hush military base. He smashes headlong into it, and in the most deadpan drawl, mutters ""damn"" in all seriousness. This one moment sort of sums up the absurd vibe that thrums throughout the whole film. It's kind of like a Coen Brothers thing; you either get it or you don't. This film isn't quite as hilarious as it's sister, Burn After Reading, but damn if it doesn't try, and come out with some really weird and memorable stuff. It's colorful hogwash that the cast sells with the enthusiasm of a drunken used car salesman, and speaking of cast, wow there are a lot of heavy hitters playing in the sandbox here. George Clooney, in yet another of his patented lovable goof roles, plays Lyn Cassidy, a former US Army nutjob who claims to have been a part of a clandestine program called the New Earth Army, employing paranormal powers in their missions. Bemused journalist Ewan McGregor is shanghai'd into following him on a mad goose chase to find out if any of his stories are true, but mostly just to babysit him, as he's kind of a walking disaster. Ineptitude reaches a breaking point when we meet pseudo hippie Bill Django, played by Jeff Bridges who channels every other oddball role he's done for maximum effect. Bill headed up the program until he got stymied by opposing official Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey), a tight ass skeptic with no patience for such silliness. In fact, one must have a huge tolerance for such silliness to sit through this, and a sense of humour just south of normal to appreciate what it has to offer. I have both, and greatly enjoyed it, despite being thoroughly bewildered. Watch for Stephen Root, Glenn Moreshower, Rebecca Mader, Nick Offerman and good old Robert Patrick in a cameo as some sort of vague spy dude.

","""More of this is true than you would actually believe."" A title card tells us before the film starts. This story that you will never believe is actually based on anything in reality starts off with Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) a down on his luck reporter who goes to Iraq to get the latest scoop on the War on Terror. In doing so he meets Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) a former US Army soldier who was part of a top secret unit of the Army called the New Earth Army, which was a unit that used paranormal powers. As Lyn drives Bob to an Army outpost he tells his the history of the unit, with Lyn's friendship with his commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django (Jeff Bridges). But because Lyn and Bob are in Iraq they run into Al Qaeda and a security detail that complicate their lives. Luckily Lyn's psychic abilities always get them out of a jam. Overall I thought this was a good comedy that always managed to put elements of humor in at the right moments. I also can't help but feel that the movie I really about friendship. Bob and Lyn's dialog together is funny, and Clooney gives a great comedic showing. The movie is also told in many flashback scenes with Lyn and Bill in the New Earth Army and the relationship that these two guys have is just great.

"Al_The_Strange","7","2","3","30 January 2014"," ""It's the silence of the goats.""
","It's a premise so hard to believe, it can't be true. Or is it? Jon Ronson dug into it and discovered that, apparently, the US military invested in programs to develop soldiers with psychic powers, to include the ability to become invisible, walk through walls, disarm opponents, and even stop a goat's heart just by staring at it. Ronson's findings were published as a book, which started off sounding cooky and silly, but went into some dark, eye-opening territory by its second half, as the book drew some connections with the modern War on Terror (primarily with the use of subliminal messaging, drug experimentation, and unusual torture techniques).<br/><br/>In 2009, this film came along, dramatizing Ronson's book. With an upbeat tone and a quirky sense of humor, the film induces some decent laughter; some of the biggest highlights include seeing a general trying to walk through a wall, seeing the military embrace New Age hippy culture, and of course, watching guys staring at goats. The tone is straight-faced, making it all seem the sillier, but without sacrificing too much of its plausibility. The comedy doesn't always work, and the film's pacing suffers from a few hiccups, but otherwise it's rarely a bore.<br/><br/>The film takes many liberties with the source material, to the point where it distances itself from its non-fiction roots and becomes, simply, a story. The narrative follows the same path as the book, but uses a few more twists and dramatizations to make it stand out more as an actual story, rather than as any type of journalism. So, as a comedy, the film is decent; as a presentation of the book's findings, there are a few embellishments, exaggerations, and a lot of facts tweaked around (including name changes galore, more added to the events, more added to the narrator's life story, and some other stuff omitted). Ultimately, there may be some truth scattered around this film, but it's dramatized to the point where it's best seen for its entertainment value rather than anything enlightening.<br/><br/>This film uses good and steady photography and editing. Acting is great; George Clooney steals the show throughout with a perfectly nuanced and humorous performance, while Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Spacey all do the best they can. The writing is decently sardonic and witty. This production uses good, real-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is good, especially with the old-fashioned rock.<br/><br/>Looking at this film from the comedic level, it satisfies on the same level as a Coen Bros movie, although it's not quite at the same level of brilliance. If you're looking for more actual facts on the movie's subject matter, you'd be better off reading the original book and doing some more research. Overall, I'm still not even sure whether or not I really believe in the subject matter's validity, but on film, it is pretty amusing.<br/><br/>3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)"

","Directed by Grant Heslov, and based on a Jon Ronson book by the same name, ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" stars Ewan McGregor as a journalist who travels to Kuwait and then Iraq during the 2003 Iraq War.<br/><br/>""Goats"" is typically read as either a comedy or a piece of investigative journalism. What it also is, though, is a very calculated political statement. It's plot is essentially this: after the Vietnam War, a series of US soldiers lose faith in the United States and begin to see it as a violent, callous nation. They thus promptly become hippies, pacifists and New Age activists. Banding together, they then form the First Earth Battalion, a military unit which fights with ""love"" and for ""peace"". The Batalion's attempts to undermine the US military-industrial-complex from within, however, fail completely; the military co-opts and perverts everything with its own overarching ethos.<br/><br/>Significantly, the Battalion's soldiers, who are a team of bizarre psychic warriors, are named after the Jedi knights from George Lucas' ""Star Wars"". Like that franchise's heroes (one of which Ewan McGergor also played), they then find themselves having to make an ethical choice; choose between their ""dark"" and ""light"" sides. The film then ends with various Jedi feeling guilty for ""killing goats"", ""animals"" which Ronson turns into a symbol for any and all civilians and soldiers killed and tortured by the US war machine. The Jedi thus choose to ""set the goats"" free, a moral act which goes punished.<br/><br/>""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" stars Jeff Bridges as Bill Django, a character lovingly modelled on Bridges' now-iconic Jeffrey Lebowski. The film's soundtrack (""I See You"", ""More Than a Feeling"", ""I had a Dream"", ""Wishing and Hoping"") encapsulates a very 1960s desire for social change, a yearning which the film's climax both satiates and is sceptical of. Some have found Heslov's characters too cartoonish (the film purports to be based on a true story), but his hippies are merely the logical flip side to a military-industrial-complex that is over-funded, wholly absurd and spiritually vacuous. ""Goats"" was Heslov's feature length debut.<br/><br/>8/10 – Worth one viewing."

If you're among the latter group, then I understand how the film could disappoint. Without that overarching message--a genuine struggle between the forces of light and darkness--""Goats"" may be good for a postmodern chuckle or two, but fairly empty on the whole.<br/><br/>The fact is that the story that Jon Ronson hit on has very, very far-reaching implications: And those implications are spiritual in nature.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strongest overall message relates to how the New Earth Army vision affords us perhaps the perfect witness: A clear and clean counterexample to what came out of the Bush/neocon/PNAC (Project for a New American Century) ""vision"" for the future of American global power projection.

"colinrgeorge","7","2","3","6 April 2010"," ""The Men Who Stare at Goats""
","No, it's not a Coen brothers film, but it does a decent impression. The marks are clearly visible, foremost being the casting of veteran leads George Clooney and Jeff Bridges, and a plot that follows their reliable 'Joe-Local-gets-in-over-his-head' template. The film finds release just a year after the Coen's own ""Burn After Reading,"" and the good news is that ""The Men Who Stare at Goats,"" is just about on par with their espionage comedy, though I don't hold either in particularly high regard. Despite the misleading stylistic similarities, ""Goats"" was directed by a guy called Grant Heslov, who has a far more extensive resume as an actor than a director. He appeared in Clooney's ""Leatherheads,"" last year and this appears to be the mutually beneficial returned favor.<br/><br/>Clooney brings an oomph to the film that Bridges or Kevin Spacey or even Ewan McGregor couldn't alone, and the script trades him one of the more legitimately charming performances of his career. As Lyn Cassidy, self-proclaimed 'Jedi warrior,' Clooney partners with a small town reporter (McGregor), for an undercover psychic mission on behalf of a secret branch of the U.S. Army. Their adventure is interspersed with a history of the 'First Earth Battalion,' a regiment with a freethinking spiritual approach to global conflict, based on information pulled from the supposedly real biography (also titled ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"") by author Jon Ronson. Experiments allegedly include, as advertised, the power to fell goats through channeled negative energy and the ability to pass through walls. The movie is prefaced with the phrase, ""More of this is true than you would believe.""<br/><br/>The bureaucratic satire of the snappy flashbacks makes for considerably better comedy than the majority of the present-day sequences, which often stumble in shoehorning the amusing suppositions, characters, and gags from the precursor scenes into a narrative. The issue comes to a head in a generally misguided third act, which fumbles for dramatic and comedic footing, delivering a largely disappointing finale on both counts. Still, the movie is as easygoing as the new-age hippies it depicts, and as such, stands a difficult film to dislike.<br/><br/>Where I do take issue with it, however, is in its depiction of Jedi ability. For the most part, the effectiveness of Cassidy's powers is a punch line, though I can imagine those who believe in the telepathic potential of the mind could read him at face value, pronouncing his psychic powers truncated by a hex cast by a rival solider. These sequences are left pleasingly ambiguous with two exceptions. The first is featured in the trailer, and the second I won't spoil.<br/><br/>Cassidy and Bob Wilton (McGregor as the surrogate Ronson), are driving across the Iraqi dessert when Wilton calls out Cassidy for a peculiar upward squinting. Cassidy explains the behavior as ""cloud dispersing,"" and we cut to an effects insert from Wilton's point of view as the heavenly mass quickly dissipates. As near as I can tell, whether intentionally or not, the shot suggests that Cassidy isn't crazy and that he is legitimately paranormally gifted, which kills the quirky suspense moving forward. Others have suggested the shot represents a natural dispersion, which Cassidy merely perceives to have caused of his own volition, but the speed ramping applied to the image suggests otherwise to me. The same sequence without that single shot could easily have maintained an intriguing open-endedness.<br/><br/>The shot could hardly be said to spoil the film, which on the whole remains a fun, occasionally engaging diversion. My pre-existing interest in the strange is certainly a handicap not all audiences will share, and the proceedings favor subtle irony to joke-a- minute yuk-fests like this Summer's aggressively unfunny, ""Hangover,"" which I never really get tired of bashing. ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is an acquired taste to be sure, and even under the right frame of mind has its share of problems, but nevertheless offers an entertaining ninety minutes with some great performances and hilarious individual scenes.<br/><br/>If the Coen brothers are inadvertently receiving credit for this film, they needn't be embarrassed."

","To be honest, I didn't have much expectations for this film--I thought it would be a quirky for the sake of quirky type of indie that comes along with a barrage of random weirdness and unfocused, ill-crafted ideas (or, more precisely, anti-ideas) that end of just as unoriginal and thoughtless as the regular car-chase-and-explosion-stuffed blockbuster. I was wrong. The Men Who Stare At Goats, while not quite the thinking man's comedy, clearly sets out for that goal, grasping sometimes with desperate, ridiculous effort or sometimes with weightless ease. About two men on a psychic, visionary 'mission' (if that is the adequate term) for--actually, just what was the point of their mission? Nonetheless, it makes for lovely viewing. Or at least funny viewing. The jokes pulled and made throughout are the types that really try to make you laugh. Admittedly, they worked in this movie. Sometimes, they even give into insights and truly profound thoughts--glimpses of vision and genius--that all come into a stumbling, lost, paceless place, both fun and self-indulgent. The movie, with performances well-played with smoothness and ease, is written, designed, and shot just right, and remains funny and intelligent--and that last scene,where chaos and peace come together in a fit of mass LSD tripping--is simply glorious."

And, boy, does it focus. The main characters focus on a whole slew of things throughout the film, from George Clooney focusing on clouds in an effort to 'burst' them to Stephen Lang, who plays Brigadier General Dean Hopgood, focusing on a wall before attempting to run straight through it! GOATS is a laugh out loud look at supposedly real life events that are almost too bizarre to believe.

Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a shadowy figure, claims to be part of an experimental U.S. military unit, the New Earth Army, a legion of Warrior Monks, or Jedi's, with unparalleled psychic powers that was put together by General Hopgood under the tutelage of Bill Django (Jeff Bridges).<br/><br/>Intrigued by his new acquaintance's far-fetched stories, McGregor impulsively decides to tag along. The pair set off on a mad-cap adventure, eventually tracking Django (Bridges) to a clandestine training camp run by renegade psychic Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey). McGregor becomes trapped in the middle of a grudge match between the forces of Django's New Earth Army and Hooper's personal militia of super soldiers, a match that can only be decided by a liberal dosing of LSD.<br/><br/>THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS was inspired by Jon Ronson's non-fiction bestseller of the same name, and is an eye-opening and hilarious exploration of the government's attempts to harness paranormal abilities.<br/><br/>The jokes and the pop culture references come thick and fast or maybe, fed on a diet of conspiracy theories, I'm just making connections that aren't even there. Django is surely a reference to the classic spaghetti western of the same name while Clooney's Cassady and Lang's Dean Hopgood have got to be a reference to Neil Cassady's Dean Moriarty character in Jack Kerouac's ON THE ROAD.<br/><br/>The funny thing is this – all those old hippy types genuinely thought that a little LSD could change the world, that happiness was available in little tabs. Hell, even Lennon, with his Love In, and his 'Give Peace A Chance' slogan bought into the new cosmic consciousness. So what's to say that the Military didn't buy into it too? And, if they did, then chances are something like this may well have happened.<br/><br/>""More of this is true than you would believe,"" states the opening epigraph to THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS and fortunately, given the nature of man and the absurdity of war, that's probably the case, which to my mind, at least, makes the movie all the funnier. If the sight of a fully grown man trying to run through a wall is the type of thing that makes you laugh, then GOATS is most definitely for you.<br/><br/>And one thing is for sure, whether this film is true or not, it's hard not to laugh at the petty squabbling that is at the root of most arguments and, by extension, most wars. It doesn't take much to see that the problems of people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world, and it's pretty hard not to laugh at people making a big deal of beans. Or maybe I just dropped one too many tabs. Either way I loved the movie."

I nearly gave up after 20 minutes but decided to carry on in the hope it would get better, unfortunately it did not. It seemed to comprise of a collection of sketches tied together by constant Jedi jokes. On reflection the whole point of this film was to have someone from Star Wars - Ewan McGregor aka Obi-Wan Kenobi (a Jedi) - and mention Jedi every so often - this 'joke' got very tired after the first mention. What if they could not get a Star Wars Jedi actor to play the role of reporter? - perhaps the film wouldn't have been made."

The screen play was weak and the story line never quite got off the ground. There were a few slapstick moments in the film that made me laugh. The script needs to be reworked and the movie redone. I just finished reading a WWII story where a young Lieutenant was standing in the middle of a road exposing himself to fire shouting for Germans to surrender. He then went into their midsts doing the same thing. I believe a total number just under 30 surrendered before he ran into one that could not be swayed by the Lieutenants charisma and was gunned down.

Apparently they believed that audiences, like the goats of the title, would be unable to resist the mind-control of a manic nutcase with a scorching case of megalomania. If you leave the theater being able to answer the question, ""What was the point of this movie?"" please write and tell me. Better yet, write and tell the director, because he's even more clueless than I am. The actors in this nonsense are literally all over the place, flailing around without the slightest idea whether they're appearing in a comedy, a farce, or a drama (and if what George Clooney is doing in this film is ""acting,"" I ought to be earning a cool 20 mil every time I walk out of the house, too). More than a few of the scenes have all the hallmarks of ""improvised"" moments in which nobody knew in what direction to take the film, so they decided to throw in an explosion or a fight or a flashback. What it is, is unadulterated dreck, a colossal flop that ought never to have been released. ""The events in this film are truer than you could possibly imagine"" says the legend that follows the opening credits.

","Even the collection of great actors Clooney, Bridges, McGregor, and Spacey was not enough to give this movie a reason to watch. I'm convinced that this movie was written while the author was at a party with friends and was stoned or high. It must have been a group effort with each friend providing their ideas for the story and each one is included. <br/><br/>There is essentially no plot. One can hardly even write a synopsis of this film - but we try. ""Looser journalist Bob Wilton, desperate to make some kind of mark in his world and impress his wayward adulterous wife, decides to take at face value the story of one certified lunatic. To get the story, Wilton must track down lunatics #2 & #3 to research the story. In the process #2 takes him on a journey through Iraq through what is a drug-head trip and Wilton converts himself into a lunatic. Wilton becomes his imagination and lives as if it is his reality."" That might make a good story but, it doesn't have the cohesiveness to make any sense and each unbelievable event has no or very little connection to the rest of the film. Some of the events are funny such as when #2 stares at a cloud in and effort to practice his ""cloud bursting"" skill, he takes his eyes off the road in a flat dessert and runs into the only rock able to total his vehicle. It must have been the revenge of the cloud that placed the rock in the middle of the flat road. When finally we get to see #2 stare at a goat, the joke is dead, as dead as the goat and not at all funny. <br/><br/>There is a funny part, when the whole ""camp"" is fed LSD by #3 in its breakfast of eggs and in its drinking water. The troops begin to trip and actually do things that are hilarious. Some get into a tank and drive it through the security gate and into the desert with no destination or mission, it goes back and forth in the background of the following scenes. The breach in the fence allows the prisoners of war, - oh, this post was a holding jail for captured enemy we see - to escape into the desert. Again the problem is, it has no connection to the rest of the story. <br/><br/>Without a story, there can be no climax and no ending so the writers and director have Lunatic #2 & #3 fly off into the sun in a helicopter (that seems to come out of nowhere) leaving Wilton, now certified lunatic #4 to ""carry on the mission"". We ask, what mission? The copter literally flies off into the sun like the cowboy rides off into the sunset in a western. But that is not then ending after all. We are smitten with having to watch Wilton go back home and come to terms with a wife that prefers another man and maybe that is what was needed for his peace of mind all along - to be rid of an unloving woman both physically and emotionally."

","A drab shell of a movie, The Men Who Stare at Goats has a little humor, a little drama, and a little action, but too little of any one thing to warrant a second look. It's aimless and largely laughless, despite a top-name cast.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor plays a small-time U.S. journalist named Bob Wilton, who meets a man named Lyn Cassady, played by George Clooney, to claims to have taken part in a secret army unit that trained in the use of paranormal abilities to help win the war through fairly peaceful means, in a program called the New Earth Army. Cassady believes he's been given a mission by the group's leader, Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), so he heads into Iraq with Bob in tow.<br/><br/>Truly, it's entertaining to see George Clooney, well, act, but despite his efforts here and his chemistry with McGregor (great swaths of the movie are of the buddy-pic variety), it's a doomed, wasted performance. Wilton and Cassady run into the sort of troubles you'd expect a single U.S. soldier and a journalist to run into in Iraq, including getting taken hostage by a mercenary ""security"" detail that's ostensibly there to help keep the peace. Where's it all leading? Well, no place special, it turns out.<br/><br/>Director Grant Heslov has trouble weaving the various tones and atmospheres together into a cogent movie. Cassady seems like a nice guy who may or may not have actual psychic abilities; Wilton seems befuddled or paranoid almost all of the time. Bridges is spacey; Kevin Spacey is a venomous coparticipant in the New Agey program. But they all seem to be in different movies.<br/><br/>Many references are made to Jedi Knights, that the men who were in the New Earth Army – which is as hippy-dippy as it gets – are the peaceful warriors who use their mind tricks to win hearts and minds. Of course, McGregor himself appeared in three Star Wars films as a Jedi Knight, which makes one wonder if the producers scanned their Rolodexes for actors who had been actual virtual Jedi Knights already. Hooray for serendipity, huh? At any rate, Cassady is supposed to be on the Good Side of the Force (which isn't mentioned by name, but you know that's what they meant), and Spacey's Larry Hooper is supposed to be on the Dark Side – probably because he wants to use psychic powers for violent means. But rest assured, there's no killing (of humans) to be done in this movie using thinking caps.<br/><br/>So what is the point? It's an interesting story that Bob gets to tell his readers, but it feels a little underdeveloped here. The movie would have been better if it had stuck to a particular tone, whether it was slapstick or a straight-forward action movie. Either would have helped form a more cohesive plot. What we get instead was a jumble of personalities and factory-seconds puzzle pieces; it's as if the movie wanted to be existential and concrete at the same time. Call it Schroedinger's Movie."

","I had read and enjoyed Jon Ronson's book that was the basis for this film. That book was an expose of the U.S. Army's attempt to develop the capacity to view faraway things by extrasensory perception and to kill merely with mental energy and to pass through solid objects as a ghost would. That the Army was doing those things had a kind of political point-- the commander-in-chief at that time was regularly consulting an astrologer. What was comic about the situation was that the people doing this work were deluded and foolish. Their officers and administrators were deluded, foolish and had more money for their work than they prudently knew what to do with. But you can't make a feature film where practically everyone on screen is a deluded fool, they have to have something noble about them. Which nobility the stars of this movie have. But their beliefs have to be vindicated, at least a little, at least symbolically. In the end, the movie is unsatisfying, because what those guys believed is ridiculous. An army that thinks that it might be able to do remote viewing, etc., is not serious. This film is an entertainment, a comedy. It may well be intended to give people relief from their deadly serious lives. Still, after the movie, I was concerned that the makers of the movie were not serious about serious things: evasions of reality with or without drugs. Ewan McGregor is miscast-- hard for me to accept him as a nebbish."

","Full of promise, ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" has a potentially engaging premise - the front (today) and back (back then) story of a gifted psychic (Clooney) engaged by a secret cadre of the U.S. Army hoping to utilize their supposed psychic capabilities to find military men who have been kidnapped, find out what the enemy is doing remotely (""remote viewing"" as it is called in New Agey circles), and so on - yet it ultimately falls flat.<br/><br/>Told in two time frames - early in the Iraq War (2003-ish) and in the late 70s/early 80s - it centers most precisely around Clooney's character, Lyn Cassidy. The story finds its way initially when Ewan McGregor's reporter, who, while slumming as a writer for a small town newspaper, picks up a story with a few-bricks-short-of-a-brickhouse Stephen Root who claims to have been a member of said super-secret Army platoon. Rightfully thinking him completely bonkers, McGregor's ""Bob"" dismisses the story until he discovers his wife is having an affair with his one-arm editor (go figure - that's how these things work in these bizzaro-type movies) and, in the throes of an existential crisis, he dashes off to Iraq, fatefully meeting Clooney's Cassidy - one of the prodigies of said super-secret military cadre - at a Kuwaiti hotel while waiting for clearance to cross the border into Iraq.<br/><br/>The movie is then basically a series of flashing back and moving forward to the more contemporary setting of the story, whence we learn more about Lyn's history with the New Earth Army Unit, a kind of proto-military hippie faction run by an ultra New Agey tree hugging ex-now-current hippie colonel, Jeff Bridge's Bill Django. Replete with '70s-era pop-psychology pablum and neologisms, Django is the long-haired hippie freak all the generals feared, yet suddenly embraced when the circumstances - notably a fear that the Russians might be developing psychic ""super soldiers"" (because THEY (the Russians, that is) thought the Americans were, but in fact they weren't, but now the Americans must because the Russians are because they think the American military is) - force them to accept the side show on their military base.<br/><br/>The movie never quite finds a workable bead of a plot. At times it is quite funny and Clooney is good as a somewhat spacey, somewhat enigmatic, somewhat obtuse well-intentioned ex-but-current psychic super soldier (we're never really sure). Bridges is great as Django - he has just the right amount of self-confident mellow ebullience to be a believable hippie guru type, and McGregor relaxes his way along as a Midwestern reporter who is smart, but really doesn't have much of a clue about all that he is encountering. It's darn funny when Clooney starts talking about ""YOU need to be a Jedi Warrior!"" and McGregor says ""I don't know what this is - what is a Jedi Warrior?"" given his history with the Star Wars series.<br/><br/>But, as interesting as the back story is (and who knows what portion of it may or may not be true) the story set in Iraq kind of meanders its way along and seems vague and pointless, even if it's meant to in a way contribute to the back story and vice-versa. The modern-day events seem disconnected to their relationship with the New Earth Army and I found myself rapidly losing interest in the modern day story.<br/><br/>It's difficult to wholly recommend ""Goats"" to a sane viewer even as a passable movie; it does have a certain charm to it and I was kind of fascinated with the improbable nature of the back story of the New Earth Army and the characters that peopled it. There's a lot of heavy hitters on this one - Clooney, McGregor, Bridges, Spacey - but it might have been more entertaining as an independent film without so much weight that the big stars brought unnecessarily to it. Then again, it's not likely it would have found mainstream distribution had it been resigned to that category.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't think I'd bother to see this again. It's all a bit too weird to fully recommend even as entertainment."

It mocks Buddhist legends, paranormal experiences and physic healing. <br/><br/>Unlike the Coen brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou?, this flick has neither the superb music soundtrack, which made that 2000 movie such a hit, or a plot as compelling as Homer's epic ""Odyssey.""<br/><br/>Director Grant Heslov is probably best known as The Rock's goofy sidekick in The Scorpion King.

"Likes_Ninjas90","8","3","7","15 October 2010"," A surprisingly significant black comedy
","Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) is a journalist assigned to interview a man who believes that he acquired psychic powers. When the man shows Wilton a video of himself killing his pet hamster with his mind Wilton becomes transfixed by the story. When Wilton discovers that his wife is having an affair however, he decides to prove his worth by travelling into Iraq, following the US invasion. He continues his investigation of the man's claims of the New Earth Army: a US military organisation, run by hippies, who train soldiers to become Jedi's with psychic powers. These powers were supposedly tested on animals such as goats and granted men the ability to run through walls and kill things with the mere glimpse of their eyes. By accident, Wilton encounters Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a former Jedi who still believes he is on mission. He reveals to Wilton more about the organisation, including a rival Jedi student (Kevin Spacey) and the use of drugs such as LSD, courtesy of New Earth Army's hippie leader Bill Django (Jeff Bridges)<br/><br/>The Men Who Stare at Goats is directed by Grant Heslov, who previously wrote the screenplay to Goodnight and Good Luck with George Clooney. This is significant because while although this film might just seem like an insane, loopy comedy, at its core there is a similar truth to Heslov's previous work: the need for integrity in journalism, no matter how it will be received. It is also important that one is told at the beginning of this film that there is more truth to this story than one might expect. Underneath the wackiness and straight-faced humour, the subtext of the film and the subject matter is a lot darker and more timely than one might initially suspect. The film is essentially about journalism, but also the dangers of brainwashing and the manipulation of soldiers before they are taken into combat. In one of the film's darkest moments, a soldier who has been training with the New Earth Army and given LSD, walks into the middle of an army base naked with a pistol in his hand and begins firing shots. The camera cuts away from him and the audience here's one final blast of the gun. It what is a wickedly funny film, this is a surprisingly black moment that certifies Heslov's message and his concerns. Sometimes the subtext becomes clouded beneath the humour and some may lose sight of the seriousness of the subject matter. Regardless, it is still certainly there and it is possibly because of these left-wing views that the film was rather coldly received in the USA.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why there are so many laughs throughout the film is because the very talented and rich cast has smartly discovered a near- perfect tone for their performances. Given that the psychic powers aspect of the story is so ludicrous and unlikely it makes it all the more enjoyable that the characters in the film, particularly Clooney's, play it straight and believe in their supposed capabilities with complete seriousness. Clooney here is reminiscent of the character he played in Burn After Reading, thinking that he is a lot smarter than he actually is. It is through his incompetence and the fluky nature in which he escapes several scenes without his powers that the laughs are delivered frequently. The scenes in which he tries to demonstrate the psychic abilities of his eyes to Wilton are among some of the very best in the film. There are also a pleasing amount of laughs from McGregor too as the occasionally hysterical journalist, who realises that he must break through all kinds of barriers and walls to uncover the truth to any story and also fine work from both Spacey and Bridges, who have a lot of fun with their rather silly parts.<br/><br/>The Men Who Stare at Goats is a small film, one that has been disappointingly limited in its distribution, but it is extremely enjoyable because of the many laughs and precise tone of the characterisation. All of the actors here have been smartly directed to play their roles serious, allowing one to see the hilarity of this very far-fetched philosophy. While some of the silliness and humour occasionally overshadows the film's messages, the dark subtext still remains and in reflection it reminds one of the dangers of mental conditioning as a means of justifying war, ensuring that this is a surprisingly significant black comedy."

The US government just believed it was due to people actually staring at the goat for long periods of time at them, focusing paranoid brain activity towards them, which made their heart stop. Really it was just anything that spooked them. Due to an congenital (present from birth) medical condition known as myotonia congenita or Thomsen's disease, certain goat's muscles tense up when the animal is startled and don't immediately relax.

"tnrcooper","5","2","4","12 December 2010"," Movie unsure of its identity
","Like they say, the truth is stranger than fiction. There's a reason this movie is not invented wholly out of someone's imagination but is based on the Whole Earth movement of the military in the '70s and early '80s. After the failure of the US military in Vietnam, it's not surprising that the Pentagon would put everything on the table and look for alternative methods to improve its fighting abilities. Yes, using mind control and ""remote viewing"" and psychic abilities might seem unlikely, but given the zeitgeist and the general disillusion with how things were at that time, it's not completely implausible. The Internet did originate from the Pentagon so if you can poke your friends on Facebook, you can thank the military. Anyway, I found the backstory-told in flashback by milquetoast midwestern reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan MacGregor) more interesting than what was being done in the present with the information. The different non-traditional methods of warfare had been conceived by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) who had a revelation when he realized how much his men instinctively did not want to kill a fellow human being. His research was funded by the Pentagon and he traversed various counter-cultural groups during six years during the '70s, acquiring information which the Pentagon thought might be useful in fighting in a less traditional way.<br/><br/>Cut to the present and reporter Wilton arrives in Iraq and meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) who Wilton had heard of during the course of reporting a story. They set to complete Cassady's work as a contractor and after freeing themselves from some dicey situations in which they are able to use some non-traditional methods of fighting, they finally encounter Django, working for one of Cassady's rivals, Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey). Working for Hooper, Django has been co-opted in order to use his non-traditional methods to actually kill the enemy.<br/><br/>The plot at this point is quite weak. I found the last 35 minutes or so quite meandering and very unfocused. It seems director Grant Heslov (who also wrote the excellent ""Good Night and Good Luck"") wasn't sure whether he wanted a goofball comedic work or a road trip movie, or a film with tougher social commentary and ultimately he got none. The movie seems to peter out, to me. There definitely is a good film here, but this is not really it. George Clooney gives a dynamite performance, deadpanning such goofy responses that one can't help but grin. MacGregor's character is a bit bland to begin with but he certainly does not enliven him. One can't really blame his wife for leaving him. Kevin Spacey performs very well. Jeff Bridges has charisma to burn and his work here reminds me of the spacey Lebowski in the cult ""Big Lebowski"" film. He is an extremely talented actor and conveys well the not-frequently-portrayed character of a counter-culture soldier.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable film-the script is quite good, the acting is solid, and the very fact that something similar to the events that happened in this movie occurred is amazing. However, the film ultimately tries to be too many things at once and fails."
"Adorable","5","2","4","14 April 2010"," Should have been a lot smarter
","It's got George Clooney in it and it feels like a movie the Coen Brothers might have directed but decided against. In fact, Goats reminds us a lot of Burn After Reading, except it is a tad funnier. Nonetheless, this isn't a comic tour de force by any means, it's actually a middling motion picture with a lot of wasted talent and one of the weakest wrap-ups in recent movie annals.<br/><br/>The intentionally witty title puts Goats in somewhat close proximity to previous anti-war efforts like Wag the Dog, save for the lack of mature political satire here. Instead, we get a story that starts out well enough, with Jeff Bridges portraying Lt. Colonel Bill Django, who has a revelation during combat in Vietnam and decides to sell the military on the New Earth Army. This para-normal psy ops force would practice all manner of unique peaceful warfare techniques, tapping unreal forces such as positive mind control, phasing and ""sparkling eyes"". In short, warrior monks. <br/><br/>Django recruits numerous men, among them George Clooney's Lyn Cassady. Clooney's in full Coen Bros mode here, and while his facial expressions and demeanor are as funny as ever, he can't save this movie. He's not aided at all by Kevin Spacey, who does the film's principal antagonist, one Larry Hooper, who by the way introduced the goat staring. Spacey is particularly ineffective here. <br/><br/>While the backstory takes place mostly during the cold war, the overlaying structure is told through the point of view of Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), a Michigan-based journo escaping a failed marriage through venturing to 2003 or 2004 Iraq as a second-rate war correspondent. After finally making it to the frontlines, all Wilton manages is to get involved in a re-kindled pys ops program involving the above characters. Which leads to myriad jokes about the force and jedi warriors. Probably in the script before McGregor was picked, they still come across rather cheap when told in his presence. <br/><br/>This is where Goats doesn't cut it. While the provocative premise of a hippie battalion of men with psychic superpowers and the disarming tenacity of true love sounds appealing, the execution falters, and the final moments are just an embarrassment, as the whole thing wraps up amateurishly like a goofy version of the finale from Three Kings. The main quartet of actors does well, McGregor is still very likable, but aside from a few hilarious moments, Goats ends up unimpressive, unmoving and forgettable. It's not like slamming your head against the wall, but it sure isn't worth walking on hot coals for."
"sagar272","7","2","4","26 February 2010"," Was there such a Perspective to Look at Comedy i didn Knew it...!!!!
","This film is about a journalist who goes to Iraq to find his ultimate story to prove to his wife the value of existence. He then travels with an eccentric ex American secret agent who claims to have supernatural abilities. The story follows a broken-hearted journalist (McGregor) who goes on the job to Iraq to prove to his ex-wife he isn't weary and a loser. There, he meets Lyn Cassidy (Clooney) who is a ""psychic"" soldier for the US government, trained by his paranormal hippie instructor Billy (Bridges) to use his mind, peace and love to overcome sublime military situations. The story is about adventure of two men together. It is a mix of comedy, action, drama and sci-fi. The plot is a mix of collection of different aspects, few may think it to the level of confusion but actually the script does all the justice to the movie.<br/><br/>Great and different way to look at comedy, with a lot of clichÃ© towards sci-fi and technology. The movie is essentially broken down into I'd sections first where the story is all about a loser journalist and his small world, second where he travels all the way down to Iraq to prove his life worth and gain back his wife's confidence, this the part where the actual plot and the comedy resides, later part containing the climax which I think was not just. All the critical jumble of a tickling, idiotic, eccentric comedy seemed to be undercut somehow, 'Watch people fall down, get run over, and laugh' stunts, and a painfully disjointed plot which didn do much towards the plot but where hilarious though. Rather, the movie featured more of a direction: an ill-defined, ill-conceived mission toward which two characters (Clooney's Lyn Cassady and McGregor's Bob Wilton) floated. The problem with the loose plot development, in this case, is that Clooney's chemistry with McGregor feels forced and their connection in the film equally contrived Gregor is too mature for that role I guess while Clooney is perfect for such movies as always. I can say the movie has admirable situational ironies.<br/><br/>Most of the movie contains flashbacks, beginning with Iraq War 2003 coming down all the way back to the beginning of New Age warfare.I thought the structure was not that convincing, but done really well. Flashbacks involving Jeff Bridges and Clooney help add comic relief during some of the straighter scenes in the film and also at times are used to rack up the tension and reveal interesting insights. It is of course up to your interpretation if the flashbacks are 100% real, because they are told from the point of view of Ewan McGregor, recounting stories that were told to him by Clooney. This sorts out another common criticism that the film is extremely unrealistic, but there are some key scenes saying that Clooney might not be telling the whole truth that I feel have been overlooked. Anyhow its worth watching with comedy point of view<br/><br/>My rating 7.3 out of 10."
"Robert_duder","7","2","4","17 February 2010"," Original and fun comedy with a slow, stumbling execution
","I read the first line of another IMDb reviewers entry and it really summed up everything about this film. ""Quirky Premise, clunky execution."" That is exactly what The Men Who Stares At Goats delivers. Much must be said about the originality, the dark, quirky humor and just the fact that it mostly pokes fun at itself. The cast is solid and the sarcastic one liners are rampant. Given a more fluid running plot, and some more time spent connecting the dots this could have been a real cult comedy in the same vein as O Brother Where Art Thou (also a Clooney film.) Things just never really take off and some of the humor which is written very cleverly is often delivered awkwardly and clumsily. The characters almost entirely portrayed by really brilliant actors are not nearly as in depth as they could have been. All that being said the film still is awesomely entertaining, and has some genuinely fun moments. In the grand tradition of certain types of films many of the truly funny moments in the film are covered entirely in the trailer but they are still fun to watch and you'll still laugh a lot. I also think this if the type of film that some will absolutely love and others will wonder why.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor plays wide eyed and naive reporter Bob Wilton. McGregor almost plays the role too dumb. But fortunately he also plays it very lovable and fun and he's easy to watch perform on screen. His chemistry with other cast members is lacking but as I will cover this isn't just McGregor. George Clooney gives a solid performance as quirky psychic soldier Lyn Cassaday. Clooney's Cassaday much like McGregor's Wilton come across as slow and clumsy but its an endearing factor to the characters. Their chemistry between them isn't great but it isn't bad and much of the humor comes from their interaction and adventure. As a total side note I would have loved to have seen Brad Pitt play the McGregor role because of the chemistry and Pitt can play quirky. The legendary Jeff Bridges plays leader of the psychic military squad Bill Django. He's a great character and a blast to watch. I almost wish the story focused more on him because his character and Bridges are terrific. Kevin Spacey also joins the troop in a small almost cameo role and he always is great on screen but is hardly used and his character is one that gets very little depth. I also have to mention Stephen Lang (now infamous for his role in Avatar) is also in the film in a small role but he is terrific.<br/><br/>There isn't a ton of experience behind the film makers in this case. Writer Peter Straughan is new to the big screen and director Grant Heslov is a long time actor but new director. However he's had his hand in a lot of films over the years either behind the screen or in front of it. Seeing that the author of the original novel Jon Ronson has done some directing I think they might have been better off to have direct his own work because perhaps he would deliver it better. Perhaps I sound like I'm harping on the film and I shouldn't entirely be doing that. The film is still fun and for a unique and different comedy you don't have to go anywhere else. Indie film lovers and someone tired of raunchy, silly comedies will truly enjoy a new fresh perspective. It just doesn't reach the level that many thought it would before its release. 7/10"
"girlocelot","Null","2","4","26 November 2009"," Fun fluff

The actors are all excellent; Spacey in particular, lizard-eyed, creepy and half-asleep.<br/><br/>Those that shaped the final cut made choices to tone down the black humor. That was a mistake because nothing, least of all the military, really gets spoofed, so the film becomes more like a fantasy of what clever people think is a fresh take on the war economy.<br/><br/>You'll have fun watching this - Clooney is very good, ditto Bridges, MacGregor has always left me cold but he plays goofy well. Just don't expect any real commentary on real events. It's more like a fond, ""hey, ain't those guys cute!"" shaggy dog tale."

","A group of us saw the trailer for this, and immediately decided we needed to go see this film, as the trailer made this film to be hysterically funny in a sort of intelligent, sardonic dark humor way, which we found appealing.<br/><br/>I have to agree with another poster that this film's funniest moments ARE in the trailer; I also have to agree with some critic who complained that the film wandered and rambled here and there. Not that this is a bad film by any means, I thought the casting and the performances were excellent, realistic, and gritty, with George Clooney as a standout. I quite liked Ewan Mcgregor as well, found him appealing in the character. Throughout there are genuinely moving and poignant moments.<br/><br/>However, the best I can describe this as is a very good effort that didn't have the tightness, energy, script or direction to turn this film into the laughing/crying/gut-ripping roller coaster of a movie like ""Three Kings"". From time to time I found myself getting a wee bit bored, though the film pulled me back. I also found myself frustrated over what this could have been, it was almost there.<br/><br/>Worth seeing? Yes, it's a solid effort that is better than a lot of the junk that gets released. But you might want to catch it on a DVD, couldn't honestly say it is a MUST SEE."

Led by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) The New Earth Army tries to use New Age techniques to create psychic soldiers for the military, with the aim to use their powers for non-lethal reasons, such as finding lost people. Whilst in Kuwait Michigan based journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), the best of the psychic soldiers (or Jedi Knights as his likes to call them). Bob looking for adventure joins Lyn on a mission into Iraq during the middle of the American invasion.<br/><br/>This film has a quick wit, having moments of satire and dark comedy. It personally reminded me of Dr. Strangelove, with a little Full Metal Jacket and Burn After Reading in the mix. They is a satire of elements of the war such as the use of private contractors in Iraq, to the make-up of the American military. They are also some serious topics such as the use of psychological warfare and torture. There are excellent jokes, gags and wit throughout the film. There are smart comments to visual gags. This was a cleverly written script by Peter Straughan and well directed by Grant Heslov.<br/><br/>They is a great cast in the film, George Clooney, Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor and Stephen Lang. They are all funny, even Kevin Spacey and Ewan McGregor whom roles are more serious then the others. Jeff Bridges was brilliant, playing a role similar to The Big Lebowski character the dude. George Clooney enjoy these quirky roles and entering in this role. Kevin Spacey plays a slimy villain again, but he is so good at it.

","I like George Clooney. I like comedies. I also needed a movie to see. It seemed natural, despite having the year's single most inexplicable title, I'd buy a ticket to see The Men Who Stare at Goats. Sadly, the title may have been the best thing about this movie.<br/><br/>Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor, displaying an almost flawless American accent) is a frustrated reporter for a small town newspaper. Despite fighting to be assigned to more serious stories, Bob is sent to interview yet another nut for still one more fluff piece. His wife (Rebecca Mader), who also works for the newspaper, is his only real joy in life. But when his wife leaves him for the least likely of characters, Bob throws caution to the wind and heads for Iraq in search of some real news.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his adventures in Iraq prove less than exciting. Until, that is, he overhears something in a bar that leads him to believe the nut he interviewed earlier might not have been so crazy after all. As Bob tries to learn more, he targets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) for information. Cassady seems to Bob to be a character in his own right, but not one that has much credibility or who is likely to prove of much use in furthering Bob's own goals. But Cassady does offer Bob a way to get closer to the war action, and so he's able to take advantage of at least that much.<br/><br/>On their way across the desert, Lyn talks and Bob listens. He tells stories of a hippie Army commander (Jeff Bridges) who works with a group of soldiers sponsored by a somewhat off kilter general (Stephen Lang). He describes events Bob can scarcely credit, including the tale of a man (Kevin Spacey) whose abilities prove his undoing. And there's more! Of course, the men are in a war zone and things can't stay quiet enough for stories indefinitely...<br/><br/>I still like George Clooney, and he does a credible job here. Ewan McGregor is a little wide-eyed, but I bought into his character, too. Jeff Bridges is good as is Kevin Spacey, but I really loved Stephen Lang's General Hopgood. The supporting cast, including a mildly amusing appearance by Robert Patrick (of Terminator 2 fame), is also fine.<br/><br/>So what's really wrong with The Men Who Stare at Goats? The script. Penned by Peter Straughan and based on the book by Jon Ronson (which I have not read), the premise is terrific. The fact that there's some basis in truth makes the notion more titillating and the potential for comedy that much greater. And yet it's quite simply not realized. When a movie billed as a comedy isn't funny (despite having one or two laugh-out-loud moments, the film is on balance mundane at best), you've got a pretty obvious problem as far as I'm concerned! Other more peripheral problems include what appear to me to be budgetary issues. For example, flashbacks showing a young George Clooney show instead a middle aged George Clooney wearing a wig. Now if Brad Pitt can look so flawlessly youthful as Benjamin Button, why on earth can't somebody take 20 years off Clooney? Special effects (most notably one late in the film, though there are others) appear rudimentary and are certainly unbelievable. These things also took away from any enjoyment I might have otherwise had in this film.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: The Men Who Stare at Goats had possibilities. None of them were realized. I frankly can't recommend you bother.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: There were any number of people and situations that could be interpreted as offensive to the military. I won't go so far as to suggest that that was intentional since I suspect it was a ham-handed (and unfunny) attempt at humor. But one thing I can't let go is the overall disrespect for the mainstream military on exhibit here.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Men Who Stare at Goats is rated R for language, some drug content and brief nudity. The rating might be a little harsh, but I wouldn't bring my kids anyway. Actually, the truth is,, if I'd known then what I know now, I wouldn't go myself."

Maybe ""Men Who Stare at Goats,"" (Great Title!! 1 Star for that) isn't ""Ishtar"" but only because it's shorter.<br/><br/>This is a non-movie. No premise for the movie, no rationale for the purposeless trip the main characters take, nothing that draws you into it. There were some funny routines but, honestly, I sat motionless through them still wondering what kept me sitting in my seat other than I brought two other people with me. But the funny bits (which, by the way, were not nearly as funny as, say, Steve Martin's routines in ""Roxanne) were surrounded by lots and lots of really dead space, weak dialog and routines that start but never fully materialze.<br/><br/>Clooney seems to be trying to recreate ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" but there are no believable characters to anchor the film (and NO music!). And his comrade on his journey, a loser reporter played listlessly by Ewan McGregor, is neither funny enough, nor pathetic enough to carry the part. His range falls short of slapstick comedy by a lot.<br/><br/>Then there's the ""social"" message. The Iraq War, torture, arrogant Blackwater types sprinkled in as if to make this a funny movie that's really an angry movie. But it's not; and it's not enough; and the irony, the dichotomy is not handled well. Not succinct like ""Catch-22"" and not heart wrenching like ""Life is Beautiful."" <br/><br/>No, this movie just bounces around but it doesn't bounce high enough or often enough and it certainly didn't take me along for the ride."
"thesubstream","5","3","8","4 November 2009"," Ah, that silly ol' military
","More funny than not is about the nicest thing I'll say for The Men Who Stare At Goats, the directorial debut of actor-writer-producer Grant Heslov. Based on Jon Ronson's reportorial book of the same name, the film follows small-town journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan MacGregor) as he travels to Iraq to investigate the Army's weird ""psychic spy"" program in the company of disgraced special-ops ""jedi"" Lyn Cassady (George Clooney).<br/><br/>Clooney is doing his wild-eyed huckster thing again, and doing it well enough. Jeff Bridges as the hippy founder of the psychic unit is in pure The Dude territory mode, and it's a pleasure to watch him as always. There's gags, also stunts, guffaws as well. Heslov's film, though, suffers from a lack of cohesion, collecting together a bunch of gag-highlights that while funny never really work as natural beats inside a structured, satisfying narrative. Instead they're loosey-goosey, related as anecdotes by Cassady, and the effect of that choice combined with a related-but-at-a-stretch sub-plot about MacGregor's Wilton needing to go to Iraq to prove himself leaves the film feeling too carefree, too disjointed, too stop and start. It's funny, but it's got no groove.<br/><br/>It also has no bite. The film has some laughs, some well-written scenes inside a meandering story, but one can't help feeling put-off by the sheer toothlessness of the satire. At whom is this gentle ribbing aimed? At what? The goofiness of the Army? Oh you goofy old war machine you, with your torture and black sites and the bombing and the Abu Ghraibing, you rascal. At hippies from the 70's? 10 years ago Clooney starred in Three Kings, one of the angriest, most cynically funny war films of the past 40 years, and now, two seemingly unending wars later, we're gifted a mild poke in the ribs at the crazy internal operations of that lovable wacky ol' institution, the Armed Forces of the U.S. of A. It's less an evisceration and more of a needling light-hearted love letter, and as a result, it's boring and borderline offensive in its laziness.<br/><br/>Had the film been tighter the moral weight of the film's choice to gently ""satirize"" the military wouldn't have been an issue, perhaps. It might have been able to exist as a story, appreciable as a unique narrative within the framework of the Psy-Ops program. But because the film is so scattershot in tone and implication, so wide and unfocused, it feels like a bunch of half-hearted slaps rather than the straight-right we know Clooney, Heslov et. al are capable of."

I realize that the movie is not a true adaptation of the book but the fact that he involved himself in this project at all just sealed my suspicion that he is not a journalist at all, just a cynical jackass with a childlike voice who exploits other peoples' stupidity for cash. This film fails miserably as both a stand-alone comedy and as a ""true story"". There is not one funny moment in it, just a bunch of guys being stupid, pretending to believe in magic powers for which there is zero evidence.

You know how it is. There are some kinds of movies where, no matter how dumb something is, you come out of it saying ""OMG THAT IS AWESOME!!!"" and only a couple hours later do you realize how stupid the whole thing was.<br/><br/>Goats wasn't really that kind of movie but I did come out of it wondering if it was an Instant Classic* or just another silly, somewhat counterculture-y bit of popcorn. I'm still not 100% sure. On the one hand, it has Jeff Bridges in it in a role eerily similar to Lebowski. There is a part of me that wants to think of this as Big Lebowski II: Revenge of the Lebowski. Also there are goats. On the other hand, while I appreciate the comedic elements it didn't make me laugh out loud as thoroughly as the Cohen Brothers' 90s hit did. I expect this will be a film I'll return to every few years, but I revisit Red Dawn every few years as well if you catch my drift.<br/><br/>Another thing I really liked about Goats is that it seamlessly blends the true with the silly so that if you don't already know some of the backstory you might have a hard time this was based on anything resembling truth. And yet, the US Army really did do studies on psychic powers, they really did get into it because the Soviet Union was into it and they didn't want to ""fall behind"", and well, just do a Google search on MK-ULTRA. The government prevents me from saying any more about that.<br/><br/>One thing that does kind of amaze me is the large number of bad reviews this film has gotten. In a world where the obviously sappy The Blind Side (based on a book by Billy Beane, GM of the Oakland Athletics and creator of the concept of ""Moneyball"" and baseball in general) gets 73% good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, Goats gets 54%?

George Clooney was good, I will give him that, but as for the other actors... what happened? You could tell they were sorry to be in the film. I think what looked good on paper became a disaster in production.<br/><br/>My problem with this movie is three fold. The pacing is slow, the characters are mostly cardboard, and the story line is pretty boring. There were three good laughs that were okay, but two shock scenes that they should be ashamed of. There's nothing funny about presenting facts about past events where someone was killed or maimed due to another persons abject stupidity.<br/><br/>There are certainly facts here (things based on mistakes made during the Vietnam war) that can shock a few people who don't remember or never heard of the drug culture of the 60s. But overall it's just military bashing. There is no story. This is just an array of mindless skits and ignorant plot points.<br/><br/>It's easy to make fun of the military for their past mistakes, but the writer of this film had the advantage of hindsight to slap them around with. How many mistakes are we making now? Depleted uranium? Defective flack jackets? Would anyone be justified in making fun of soldiers who died defending this country? <br/><br/>Lastly, the final scene was meant to redeem the insults, but it fell far short.

I can't see any other reason why McGregor was cast other than to have this one running joke. His painful attempts at an American accent are a constant reminder that the role should have been given to someone else.

Plus, a few characters (especially Kevin Spacey) seemed a bit undeveloped. In fact, undeveloped is probably the best way to describe all the film--like it's still missing something.

George Clooney initially presents his character as he has recently been tending towards in his straight-faced comedy, but then emerges especially with flashbacks with a entirely enticing and new persona rarely seen on screen. Ewan McGregor gets to stretch his acting with a different character breaking out from his on-screen persona (Moulin Rouge, 2001). Oddly, Kevin Spacey seems to be miscast in his beginning scenes and feels uncomfortable not only as his scene calls for but even in his undeveloped intrusion into the film, though later for better or worse, his innate comedic talent and more public character comes to the fore later in the movie. There is much to like in this off-beat, off-balanced movie, though the beginning introduction of McGregor also seems abit awkward and either unnecessary or not smoothly engaging. Overall, this movie is out of the box and retains a great light entertainment even as the more sobering experiences of war are exposed in this movie.

In TMWSAG, the stupidity is perfectly captured when one of the characters states that ""We don't really believe in any of this stuff, but the Russians are looking into it and we don't want to fall behind them"". It's easy to miss this first time round when you're expecting a story first and foremost. Once you know that it's the craziness of the situation that is the point rather than what actually happens, the whole thing somehow makes far more sense.<br/><br/>And if nothing else, seeing what would have happened if ""The Dude"" had a position of authority in the army makes the film worthwhile all by itself!"

Oddly enough, this is based on reality, but it took that reality to a different level and made not only the primary premise absurd, but also brought into question the whole logic of why we are in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. This was close to a Catch 22 or MASH type classic. George Clooney and Ewan McGregor really carry this movie. I loved Ewan McGregor in Big Fish, and still think he was better in that, but this comes pretty close to that. George Clooney is his classical comic self in this film. The other actors do a great job, too, to support their roles. I highly recommend this."

","¨I did what so many men have done throughout history when a woman has broken their heart. I went to War.¨ The Men Who Stare at Goats is one of those movies that really seems funnier in paper than in the big screen; it is one of those rare films in which the black humor is more effective when read then it is when executed. I laughed more reading the quotes from the film then I actually did while watching this movie. It isn't a terrible movie and it's short enough to not wear the viewer down, and with low expectations it can be enjoyed because there are some good performances from great actors such as George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, and Ewan McGregor. Director Grant Heslov worked in the past with Clooney in Good Night and Good Luck, but in that occasion they worked together writing the screenplay which was nominated for the Oscars. In The Men Who Stare at Goats the screenplay was written by Peter Straughan and it was adapted from Jon Ronson's book of the same name. The film claims to be inspired on some true events which is hard to believe because the film is ridiculous, but I guess it is a spoof on the psychic activities that went on in the Army. I have to give some credit to director Heslov for making a different kind of film and it is original, but it just wasn't funny enough to save the movie even though it had such talented actors. The movie had the potential to be so much better and that is what left me disappointed by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) is a reporter who has just had his heart broken by his wife that leaves him for a one armed editor. Bob is devastated and decides to go cover the war in Iraq in order to forget about her. He can't get into Iraq so he covers the war from Kuwait where he meets a special forces operator named Lyn Cassady (George Clooney). Bob remembers hearing about Lyn from a report he did years ago on a man named Gus Lacey (Stephen Root) who claimed to have been trained by the US Army in paranormal and psychic activities. Gus mentioned Lyn to be the most powerful student of the group. Bob interviews Lyn and he tells him about the special Army Unit that he was trained in called the New Earth Army. The founder of the group was Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), a Vietnam veteran who travelled around the States studying the New Age movement and adapting it for the army. Lyn was the best student, but he had a rival, Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) who had a different vision of the New Earth Army. The men were trained to become Jedi Warriors and the purpose was to manipulate the minds of the soldiers so they could put an end to war. The story is narrated by Bob and it has several flashbacks as he interviews Lyn while at the same time travels with him on a mission across Iraq having to experience these psychic abilities first hand.<br/><br/>The film has its funny moments but the pace of the movie doesn't work very well. The performance from the cast is great, but they only remind you of the potential the film had with so many talented actors and how many other great films these actors have made. The movie also claims to be based on true events, but the film is more of a spoof and makes fun of these soldiers and it is really hard to make sense of what are the true events or what even inspired them. The funniest thing in the film is George Clooney's hippie look with the long hair and the mustache, but you can laugh at that in the trailers. Jeff Brides also reminds us of his great character in the Big Lebowski, but as a soldier now. The movie really had some great potential, the material seemed good to work with, but the final product really didn't deliver. The material is dark and sometimes you have to be very careful with it if you want it to work, and in The Men Who Stare at Goats it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

Why would any of the main actors want to be in this movie in the 1st place. Where roles scarce at the time? Did they all get huge paychecks? Did they get to see the script? Yes, me thinks I have wasted my time. Who could possibly rate this movie high.Only bleeding heart liberals that think they found some profound hidden message. Or maybe they were just high. Finally, what happened to Jeff Bridges and George Clooney at the end? Please don't tell me they were planning a sequel.

Wont win any major awards but you will surely like the movie.<br/><br/>Didn't really get the connection of showing Clooney potentially with cancer and what was 'the Denmark' thing? enjoy and await the call of the US Army if you are a broken hearted journalist or a psychic or a New Age Army guy ready to enrol!"
"hunter-friesen","5","2","7","27 March 2018"," Clooney and Bridges save this aimless and humorless film that has no idea what it wants to be
","Jedi super soldiers that can kill goats with their minds. That's the real-life premise this film bases itself off of. ""It's a far-fetched concept for a feature film, but it might just be crazy enough to work,"" the writer and producer probably said as they were making this film. Unfortunately for them, and us, it doesn't. What should be a funny premise turns out to be shallow and void of any humor. Just like the real-life program the film showcases, the idea was just too crazy and the execution was too stupid to justify its own existence. <br/><br/>The film starts out introducing us to Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), a journalist stuck in Ann Arbor doing pointless stories. One day he interviews a man who served in the New Earth Academy and share his story as a psychic soldier. A soldier that can spy using telepathy, see into the future, and kill anybody just with sight. <br/><br/>Being fed up with dealing with lowlifes, Bob ventures to Iraq to cover the war (setting is 2002), but comes up short as he isn't allowed to go into the war zones. While waiting to get his big break, he meets a man named Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), who was the best New Earth Academy trainee in history. Because of the coincidence that he meets another academy member, Bob gets the story behind the academy's leader, Bill Django (Jeff Bridges). Django was a Vietnam veteran that didn't agree with violence, so he persuaded The Pentagon to fund a new project that would create ""Jedi"" soldiers that could nonviolently incapacitate an evil regime. From this point on we cut between Bob and Lyn's time in Iraq to Django and Lyn starting the New Earth Academy in the 70s.<br/><br/>From the sound of that premise, I would expect this film to embrace its goofiness and unbelievability and use it to create lots of laughs. Well, I was wrong. What should be and was marketed as a comedic film turns out to be a straight lined story that doesn't really feel like anything. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, and it's surprisingly not interesting. It just feels like the hallowed remains of what could have been.<br/><br/>Another mistake the film repeatedly makes is that it tries to be something it's not. It unnecessarily tries to tackle many different themes such as friendship, acceptance and living with the past. You would think that touching on those themes would lift this film above the usual lower comedies, but alas you would be wrong again. None of the themes mesh together and make the film feel very disjointed about what messages it is trying to send. <br/><br/>What I wanted and expected from this film was crazy antics from great actors, but what I'm given is a failed story that spends way too much time being hokey and sentimental instead of actually being funny. <br/><br/>The main actors in this film can be put in two categories: Saving graces or disappointing baggage. <br/><br/>Ewan McGregor takes the top spot on the disappointing baggage team. I still haven't figured out if McGregor is a good actor, mostly because his quality vastly changes from film to film. I love the guy, but he's never really consistent. He was excellent in the Trainspotting and Star Wars films, but terrible in Our Kind of Traitor and Mortdecai. I know those bad films came after this one, so you could claim that this film was the beginning of a slump. <br/><br/>George Clooney is the biggest saving grace. He has fun with his material and delivers a performance that is off-kilter comedic. <br/><br/>Jeff Bridges is also a saving grace as he channels his ""Dude"" behavior from The Big Lebowski. He's obviously having fun with the role and just kind of goes through each scene carefree.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey balances out the teams and joins McGregor as disappointing baggage. Spacey plays Larry Hooper, an academy member who disagreed with Django's methods and who was jealous of Lyn's natural talent. Spacey tries to play as the abandoned son, but he just doesn't seem interested enough in his role. <br/><br/>The Men Who Stare at Goats is a film that takes itself way too seriously and doesn't know what to do. It wants to be a thoughtful comedy with lasting merits. The only thing is, nobody else wanted that. People wanted a goofy comedy with a few good laughs. The film tries too hard where it shouldn't and doesn't try enough where it should, which is why it ends up being boring and forgettable."
"MBunge","4","2","7","24 June 2011"," Clever, not funny.
","This movie is a wasted effort by a lot of very talented people. It's got a top notch cast and a wonderful concept, but these filmmakers never really figured out what sort of story they wanted to tell and then were too cute by half in the telling of it. Though not without its charms, The Men Who Stare At Goats is ultimately uninvolving and concludes with a burst of feel good moments that are so forced it's like they were manufactured in a labor camp.<br/><br/>When the wife of small time newspaper reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) walks out on him, he decides to run away to the Middle East and become a war correspondent covering the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. While he cools his heels in Kuwait, Bob meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney) and discovers what should be a far more interesting story. As the two wander through the desert, Lyn tells Bob about his time as a secret psychic soldier for the U.S. Army. Under the new age tutelage of Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), Lyn and others supposedly learned to use the power of their minds to become ""Jedi warriors"" capable of the most amazing feats. Then an embittered sci-fi author (Kevin Spacey) joins the program, gets Django tossed out and puts the alleged powers of Lyn and others to evil use.<br/><br/>After all the flashbacks are over, the movie suddenly drops the whole psychic stuff and becomes a morality play about American involvement in Iraq, complete with capitalist mercenaries shooting each other by accident and prisoners being tortured on a secret base. Bob and Lyn strike ridiculously quixotic blows against American militarism, then it all wraps up with a call to action that seems to mock the idea that anything can really change.<br/><br/>The Men Who Stare At Goats is built like one of those Russian nesting dolls, but not in a good way. At first, it's the story of Bob trying to find meaning and masculinity in his life. But he ends up just standing around while the movie becomes about Lyn's sort-of-but-not-quite comedic adventures as a psychic solider. Then within Lyn's tale, we get the story of Bill Django and his efforts to blend military purpose with hippie counterculture. The most intriguing story is Django's and it's dealt with in the briefest way. Lyn's is the next most interesting but is related exclusively through overly clever flashbacks. Bob's part of this yarn is the least engaging, so of course he's the character the audience is supposed to identify with and follow through the film. You might have been able to make something out of either Lyn's or Bill's experiences, but smooshing them together inside Bob's lackluster ""hero's journey"" produces a motion picture that never settles on who or what it's about. <br/><br/>And then there's the problem that this is a comedy that tries and usually fails to get any laughs. The humor is too dry to be really funny and too wry to have any real bite. There're also some jokes that simply don't work, like constantly referring to the psychic soldiers as ""Jedi"". That's supposed to be funny because, you know, Ewan McGregor was in the Star Wars prequels. The joke wouldn't work if some other actor had played Bob and it still doesn't work with McGregor in the role. The Men Who Stare At Goats also falls prey to the common flaw of too many 21st century comedies in that what it wants to be is clever. While it succeeds, being clever is not the same thing as being funny. Instead of responding to this film with laughter, you can only admire its cleverness and I generally want a movie to entertain, not ask me to admire it.<br/><br/>It's a shame because there's obviously a lot of skill and ability being used here. Too bad it couldn't have been used to a more defined and less conceited purpose."
"robert-temple-1","9","2","7","13 May 2010"," A close encounter with remote viewing
","By now most people are aware that the US military once had a 'remote viewing' team of psychics, who would sit in the USA and remotely view Soviet military sites. Individuals such as Ingo Swann made this popular knowledge long ago, several years after the team was supposedly officially disbanded. This film is based upon the experiences of certain former 'psychic warriors', as recounted in a book about them by Jon Ronson. Some of these men appear in candid interviews in a documentary, 'The Real Men of the First Earth Battalion', which is an extra on the DVD, and which is just as interesting as the main film itself. We must not be so naïve as to imagine that the whole story, or even a wholly accurate partial story of this subject has been or ever can be revealed to the public. To a certain extent, partial revelation even could be considered to constitute disinformation. If you have ten things to say and you only talk about two of them, while concealing the eight others, your frankness about the two you choose to reveal is not necessarily as frank as it seems. Those who have ears to hear, let them hear. The title of this film refers to the fact that the military psychics would stare at goats and by the power of their mental concentration alone would make their hearts stop, so that they would drop dead. There is said to have been a real goat unit, and that this story is true. I have no doubt that it is. Hence, 'the men who stare at goats'. Someone has seen the comedic potential in all this, and the film is an outrageously funny comedy with a serious background. George Clooney's comic talents are in full play, and 'Clooney as a looney' is a great success. He certainly is one of Hollywood's finest and most interesting actors. Jeff Bridges gives admirable comic support as a soldier who turns into a hippie and starts all this alternative mind-bending stuff. Kevin Spacey is excellent at being the jealous and ruthless sorehead who wants all the glory for himself, which is of course the path of the fallen angels. The true roots of all this go back to Nazi Germany. It was the Nazis, especially the teams who worked under Heinrich Himmler, who perpetuated the black uses of psychic phenomena which they had derived from the tradition of their predecessors, the Teutonic Knights. The USA became alarmed by this in the late 1930s and authorised the well-known psychologist Clark Hull to try to befriend Hitler and Himmler's chief hypnotist, Ferenc Volgyesi, which he did prior to the outbreak of the War. When the War was over, under Operation Paperclip and other similar operations, a large number of SS specialists came to America, and Volgyesi was amongst them. He even adopted the name 'Frank' to show how American he was willing to be. The public story goes that the USA did not wake up to psychic phenomena until Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier published their extraordinary best-seller LE MATIN DES MAGICIENS in 1960, which appeared in England in 1963 as THE DAWN OF MAGIC and in the USA in 1964 as THE MORNING OF THE MAGICIANS. This shocking book was followed a few years later by the best-seller PSYCHIC DISCOVERIES BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN, by Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder, a copy of which is seen being read in this film. The story for public consumption is that the appearance of these books woke up a sleepy Pentagon and made them realize that the Soviets were deeply involved in psychic research in relation to warfare, and that the USA had better do the same, or it might be a security threat to America. Of course, what had really been going on was that America's Germans and the Soviet Union's Germans had been competing with each other in these areas ever since 1945. For instance, more than 50% of all hypnosis experiments in the history of the USA have been carried out by agencies or departments of the Government and are classified as top secret. The revelations about Project MK Ultra and related endeavours are only the tip of an iceberg of which we will never see the rest. We should not be so silly as to imagine that just because the battalion portrayed in this film was disbanded many years ago, all such things have stopped. Many of the phenomena shown in this film in comedic fashion are deadly serious matters which have been studied for millennia. Take the attempt by soldiers to pass through walls by running at them, as shown in the film. Anyone familiar with Chinese Taoism will have read the supernatural stories of Pu Songling, dating from 1679. Here is a quote from his story 'The Taoist Priest of Lao-Shan'. The priest has a disciple called Wang and 'he told him to walk through the wall, and the wall yielding to him as he passed, in a moment he found himself outside.' As Tang Meng-Lai, a commentator on Pu Songling, points out: 'Men are wont to attribute an existence only to such things as they daily see with their own eyes  how then is it possible for a man to understand the rationale of things he can neither see nor hear  but we cannot argue therefore that they do not exist.' Astrophysicists now say that 95% of the Universe consists of 'dark matter' and they don't know what it is. Well, well! Is that so? If you think the Pentagon and the security agencies have lost interest in 'the vast invisible', think again. But while we muse on that subject, powerless to learn more, we can meanwhile laugh our heads off at George Clooney. That's called fiddling while the goats die. No animal was harmed in the writing of this review."

","Grant Heslov, producer and co-writer of Good Night, and Good Luck has took a stab at a new satire type of comedy, The Men Who Stare at Goats. Starring Academy Award Winners George Clooney and Kevin Spacey, Academy Award Nominee Jeff Bridges, and Ewan McGregor this funny, although at times flat gem tries to take itself a bit too seriously. Heslov pokes fun at the military, which is funny, war, which is not so funny, and the stupidity of our leaders across the globe.<br/><br/>The performances for the most part pull you though immensely and you rely on them solely for it to succeed. Ewan McGregor, snubbed big time for Moulin Rouge, is the best that he's been in years. His amusing gestures and screen chemistry with fellow co-star Clooney are some of the best parts of the film. His ""Bob Wilton,"" a journalist searching for his life-altering moment for his cheating spouse, is sympathetic but doesn't require too much for him.<br/><br/>Clooney is as funny as ever as ""Lyn Cassidy,"" a man on a mission with a bit more problems than he likes to show. He shows the same type of humor seen in last year's Burn After Reading. Clooney seems to be having a big year ahead of him along with a (supposedly) star turn in Up in the Air and voice-work in Fantastic Mr. Fox. Clooney has hit a stride with his choices in films and is riding it wonderfully right now.<br/><br/>Bridges, who beyond any comprehension remains without an Oscar, is delightful as any as ""Bill Django,"" a hippie military general with a unique outlook on life. Despite his minimal screen time, not interacting too much with his fellow actors, this may help his campaign for his upcoming work Crazy Heart.<br/><br/>Two-time Academy Award Winner Kevin Spacey shows his villain-like chops once again as ""Larry Hopper,"" a relentless and jealous soldier looking to lead an operation of his own. Spacey doesn't go above and beyond anything we've seen of him lately but it's a solid turn for him nonetheless.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Peter Straughan is nothing spectacular, at times the narrative takes sudden twist and turns that lose the viewer throughout. I'm not sure if it's trying to make a political statement or just vaguely make fun of it. However, Heslov and Straughan's film may not be for everyone and it seems everyone is exactly split on it. The Men Who Stare at Goats is hugely entertaining for wise-cracks and shock value, the true story part however, is up to you to decide.<br/><br/>***/****"

Anyway, I watch it and decide, well, I'll tell you what I decided at the end of this. <br/><br/>Bill Django (Bridges) is the father, so to speak, of the Earth Army that train by Remote Viewing and other psychic techniques. Lyn (Clooney) was a gifted student and had exceptional psychic abilities and now he wants to hook up with Django in Iraq. Bob Wilson (McGregor), a reporter, goes with him. <br/><br/>This is billed as a comedy, but there was nothing funny in here, no good lines, no physical sight gags. This was a movie for the Clooney-McGregor-Bridges-Spacey in-crowd. I can see no other purpose. It has absolutely nothing to offer except for those of you who want to Google Remote Viewing. That is real.<br/><br/>There are a ton of flashbacks that go on for soooooo long that you forget what brought the memory up in the first place.

"classicsoncall","8","1","3","18 September 2018"," ""Find out what your destiny is, and the river will carry you.""
","In the tradition of all your best Catch 22's, this film's major thrust is to illustrate the absurd by being absurd. It does a pretty good job of it too, offering all kinds of circular reasoning and almost coherent sounding psycho-babble. Riffing on concepts laid out in ""Star Wars"", the military takes an interest in using psychic powers to take out the enemy, and forms a super soldier unit to develop the Jedi like potential certain individuals seem to possess. Clooney is hilarious in the story, at his best demonstrating the myriad capabilities of an object that looks like a can opener, but having a hundred uses, each of which can incapacitate an enemy - ""It has warrior capacities, and it looks a little bit funny"". His character, Lyn 'Skip' Cassady, does it all with a straight face too, at times impressing and at others infuriating reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), who tags along hoping to earn the scoop of the century if they can only figure out where they are.<br/><br/>The film has a fairly formidable cast with Clooney, McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, with Bridges in a role that he parlayed into virtually repeat performances as wildly different characters in the same year's ""Crazy Heart"" (for which he won a Best Actor Oscar), and the following year's ""Rooster Cogburn"" (where he might have gotten robbed of the same award). That this movie itself wasn't a nominee is understandable, it's not that long and played mostly for grins, and let's face it - staring at goats can only be done for so long before it becomes monotonous. But if you enjoy quirky satire, this fills the bill with it's goofiness and dead pan deliveries by the principals. I'd love to see the outtakes from this picture, the guys making it must have had a blast."

The story is very fluid, told with the help of wise and funny flashbacks, all actors drag you into the story from the first moment. Without extreme scenes or gimmicks the story litterally flies in front of your eyes.
However, now that I am writing this I realize that you should watch The Men Who Stare at Goats with one caveat: if, for any reason you go Stan for the US army, or think that any irony thrown at any US foreign policy is a personal insult to you, you should move forward and watch Gunny (with all due respect to the great Clint)."

","Its not new in Hollywood to present bland silliness and satire packaged with utmost seriousness, 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' comes off initially as a potential winner from this genre. While it had the necessary humor and a stellar star-cast capable of enacting that, the script neither reaches the edginess it should have nor pushes the boundary to make this movie memorable.<br/><br/>Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) is a journalist by profession and going through a professional and personal crisis that he is so desperate to get out of. When he meets Gus Lacey (Stephen Root) and hears about the US Army's 'New Earth Army' that deals with parapsychology and psychic capabilities trained by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), he knows that he encountered the story he has been waiting for that could get him out of his crisis. He meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) by chance in Iraq and tags along with him into wilderness to cover a 'mission' in action.<br/><br/>George Clooney and Jeff Bridges have played goofy characters in the past - 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' and 'The Big Lebowski' respectively, a little disappointed that they don't share enough screen space. However it was more than compensated with some crackling chemistry and impeccable comic timing between McGregor and Clooney. While the writers, director and editors succeed in setting up an interesting plot taking cues from disjointed real events, the audience would be stuck in a never ending wait for the stakes to go up. Kevin Spacey does a character he has done a thousand times over and seems to have sleepwalked it. The production values are excellent all thanks to the big cast it boasts of, though the quality of humor is great, the jokes are a little too few and far to get wholesome entertainment. Though the director Grant Heslov is not new to Hollywood, it is still his debut of directing a major Hollywood feature and does a decent job.<br/><br/>Watch it for the satire, crackling chemistry and comic timing between Clooney and McGregor.

It's a lot of quirky stuff. It's not real enough to be compelling and it's not surreal enough to be fun. It's on the same path as Dr Strangelove but it's nowhere near as good.

","Okay, but quite disappointing. Had huge potential, and started out well - large degree of intrigue, and incredibly funny at times. Lost its way in the middle section - drifting aimlessly. Final section was worse - random, and tried to throw in some meaningless hippy philosophy to boot. <br/><br/>It was as if the director, Grant Heslov, was trying to emulate the Coen Brothers in making a funny, quirky, snappy-dialogued yet clever-plot movie. He even recruits two Coen Brothers regulars - George Clooney and Jeff Bridges - to try to give it a Coen Brothers feel. Unfortunately, that is where the similarity ends. This is certainly no Coen Brothers movie. They don't ever lose focus.<br/><br/>Good cast - George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey - does their best, but their talents are wasted, through either being miscast, or due to the mediocre plot and direction. Clooney and McGregor are great in their roles, but Kevin Spacey is badly miscast. Strangely, Jeff Bridges seems miscast too. You would think the role suited him - the disheveled, loony hippy - very similar to The Dude in Big Lebowski. He seems strangely flat in the role, like he was trying too hard to be the loony hippy.<br/><br/>Overall, the over-the-top humour and premise of the movie make it likable, though it could have been so much better."

","The story is really a very different kind of high imagination. Imagination is the heart of story telling. Mostly in movies it is seen in movies of Animation and Fictional genre. But this is movie does not belong to both of those categories. A journalist with the bored life and a disinterested wife decides to take some thing adventurous in his life and attempts entering Iraq. In the course he meets couple of people who worked for Black Ops in the past and claim to have psychic powers upon which they were trained upon. He meets Clooney in the attempt to go to Iraq and then he explains the whole thing that happened previously to him when he was in the New Earth Army which was responsible for the psychic power development in soldiers. And when it was used to kill a goat, Lyn (Clooney) believes their is curse laid on them. He wanted to expose all the things that happened to the world and thinks the journalist would do the job for him. He takes him to place where the psychic power research was still being done and headed in the wrong way in Iraq. He shows him that and frees all the animals and soldiers who were imprisoned there, and leaves. Definitely the performances of George Clooney,Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey is outstanding, and the most appealing part of the movie to me was ""Most of this is true than you would believe""."

","THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS has an intriguing premise - that there exist a group of men within the US Army who succeed in persuading their opponents to down their weapons through auto-suggestion, or better still, sheer power of will. The group is led by Jeff Bridges, who adopts a New Age approach to training them; Kevin Spacey is his rival, who ultimately supersedes him. The two central characters, played by Ewan McGregor and George Clooney, are like chalk and cheese: McGregor becomes unwittingly involved in the group's activities, although ostensibly seeking to enliven his otherwise humdrum existence; Clooney is almost entirely wedded to Bridges' philosophy, although we never quite know whether he possesses superhuman (or should it be super- psychological) powers or not. The film is certainly interesting in terms of subject-matter, and the distinguished cast perform their roles competently; but in terms of tone, we never know whether it is intended to be comic, satiric or tragic. Moreover there are certain elements - especially when the group interact with the locals - that have a distinctly orientalist tone; once again the non-European actors are treated as secondary, both in terms or roles and in terms of culture. But the film is nonetheless well worth watching"

","A really great cast stars in ""The Men Who Stare at Goats,"" a 2009 film directed by Grant Heslov. George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor, Kevin Spacey -- an exceptional group, with a screenplay by Peter Straughan.<br/><br/>An unlucky in love, depressed reporter (Ewan McGregor) goes to join the war in Iraq and meets a special forces agent, Lyn Cassady (Clooney). Cassady tells him a wild story about a psychic division of the military that is trained to do remote viewing and whose mission is to end the violence of war.<br/><br/>This is a great premise for a film, but it isn't done particularly well. There seems to have been no decision as to whether it was a comedy or drama. With a focus either way, the elements could have been mixed well, because there are some hilarious moments as well as some very dramatic moments. The problem is, you don't know how to react, so the experience is discomfiting.<br/><br/>I don't like animal abuse shown or talked about, even though the peace and love character played by Jeff Bridges as well as Lyn don't like that aspect of their work. I realize there was no real abuse, but what was talked about was pretty gross.<br/><br/>The performances are very good, with Clooney saying the most outrageous things with complete commitment and intensity, Bridges doing a character similar to what he played in Big Lebowski, McGregor dazed and confused, and Spacey as an ambitious guy who hopes to use the group toward his own ends.

The cast is great, with actors like George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Spacey proving (if you somehow didn't know already) that they all have affinity for comedic acting. Clooney and McGregor have wonderful chemistry (they spend most of the movie together), and I probably would have given this a higher score if the dynamic between those two in the first half of the story would have continued on into the second half. <br/><br/>McGregor plays a reporter trying to get into Iraq to cover the recent events there concerning the war, and Clooney is an undercover contractor he meets and learns about the government's attempts at developing psychic soldiers, from. They're hilarious together.   <br/><br/>TMWSAG attempts to do what Burn After Reading did so well, which was use absurdity in fiction to point out truth in real life. It's not quite as successful, though, even though I thoroughly enjoyed most of it. Some parts are hilariously funny, if you have a suitable sense of humor, but that aspect of the movie was so much more interesting to me than the overall statement about war and the military that was being made, that I became annoyed when the latter was focused on more than the former.<br/><br/>I loved the overall idea and loved the cast, but the movie as a whole was just a little too muddled and inconsistent.

","While it has an interesting story and a very good performance by George Clooney in it (every bit as good as his Oscar nominated performance in Up in the Air), The Men Who Stare at Goats is imminently forgettable. And that's just disappointing in itself. Ewan MacGregor stars as a reporter who meets up with Clooney, a supposed psychic who has worked for the Army in the past. He was part of a hippie/supernatural-inspired Army research project, the New Earth Army, and is now in Iraq (the year is 2003) on a secret mission. The film has many flashbacks to the 1980s, during the New Earth Army days. Jeff Bridges was their leader. Stephen Lange is a General who is fascinated with the supernatural and gets Bridges his funding. Kevin Spacey plays Clooney's main rival. Somehow, with this pretty darn interesting material, Grant Heslov makes absolutely nothing of it. It's never bad, per se, but it just sits there not doing much. Ewan MacGregor does drag the film down a little. He seems cast just because the constant references to Jedi (the members of the New Earth Army call themselves Jedi). It's a joke Heslov never makes work. MacGregor has a terrible time perfecting an American accent. I rarely notice when foreigners feign American accents, but MacGregor seems like he's about to have an aneurysm much of the time."

","The U.S. Military seems to be composed of two different types of men. The first are incredibly courageous to whom our nation owes its gratitude. The second are those who believe our enemies are always experimenting with foolish and outlandish ideas. Thus our country needs to create an equally ridiculous force to counter it. In this film, we have Bob Wilton, a newspaper reporter (Ewan McGregor) who's lost at the game of love and now seeks his destiny in the middle East conflict of Iraq. Along the way he meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) a mysterious new age American soldier who convinces Wilton, he is part of a secretive unit composed of mental Psychics who plan on changing the armies of the world with their mental powers. Jeff Bridges plays Bill Django, the leader of the group. Kevin Spacey is Larry Hooper, who seeks to gain control of the project for his own agenda. Stephen Lang is convincing as Brigadier General Dean Hopgood. Robert Patrick plays Todd Nixon who is believable as a traveling salesman out to tap into the lucrative Iraqi market. The use of mind bending drugs and alternative mental training is one of the many paths attempted by the military. The unusual premise does make good theater but its' questionable as the audience is unsure whether this is serious comedy or only silly drama. With such star power as herein contained, it should produce an Academy award. However, try as it may, the movie becomes rather tedious and lacks adherence to one or the other. In the end, the great ensemble is wasted on a project which should have hired the members from Staturday night live. A sincere but interesting film. ***"

","A film like this is hard to figure out. It is undoubtedly clever and funny, but near the opening of the film, a line appears on the screen reading, ""More of this is true than you would believe."" It really makes the viewer question how much of what one is watching is the truth throughout the film. While doing research on the film, I found out a surprising amount of the facts presented in the film are true. Yes, there are psychic spies, and yes, there is a so called ""Hippie Army"" division of the military. The plot of the story, however, is false. I was not disappointed when I found this out. The film works much better as a dramatization than a retelling of these odd events. Everyone in the film is obviously having a great time in their roles. Clooney, in particular, carries the film with his portrayal of Lyn. He always has a focused gaze on whatever he does, and a brilliant speaking tone, making the most outrageous points somewhat believable. Bridges gives a notable performance as well, almost reprising his role as the iconic character ""The Dude"" from the 1998 film ""The Big Lebowski."" The only exception is that he has somehow been stuck into the head of a military movement, passing out flowers and telling his troops to ""let the dance out."" The film's cast is superb. They all understand the tone of the film and know how to deliver the material in the most effective way."

","On paper this should have been a big hit since it stars several big names in the shape of George Clooney , Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges . It also features Ewan McGregor as the main character Bob Wilton and this is where the film collapses . Wilton is supposed to be an American war correspondent and if anyone who has seen one of his movies will tell you McGregor has a serious problem with American accents and a large proportion of the running time consists of Wilton speaking in voice over in a heavy handed attempt by screenwriter Peter Straughton to bring exposition to the narrative . It's a double whammy if the story needs to be explained in voice over and you find the narrator's voice distracting <br/><br/>This a great example of a film failing down to the screenplay . Every aspect of it can be faulted , It's too reliant on voice over and is fractured with the structure jumping back and forwards and director Grant Heslov compounds the problem even more by putting captions on screen explaining where and when the action is taking place which makes the audience feel they're being spoon fed information as if they're idiots . That said it is a "" black comedy "" that most vague of cinematic genres and every film aficionado knows it's probably the most difficult type of film to realise on screen successfully . A legend like Kubrick might be able to manage it but Heslov is obviously out of his depth <br/><br/>I do remember seeing a documentary by Jon Ronson several years ago based upon his book THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS . Ronson is a master of making highly idiosyncratic documentaries based upon eccentric themes and one can't help thinking that the premise lends itself better to an amusing documentary rather than Hollywood movie full of big name actors"

","""Inspired by a top secret true story"" and starring George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor, and Kevin Spacey, The Men Who Stare At Goats (in theatres November 6th) looks like its going to be, for lack of a better term, plain old silly (and I mean this in a good way). The premise of psychic soldiers, who train to pass through walls, but instead run into them, and guys who not only do stare at goats, but actually take them down by doing so, may possibly be a double-edged sword, depending on if the scenes from the trailer are only a hint of much more to come and not the just the best the flick has to offer. The preview does the job of hitting enough funny moments to warrant a full look and Clooney and Bridges characters, in particular, appearing to take themselves so seriously in some absurd circumstances, should give the audience the room to sit back, relax, and have a few good laughs. The storyline is straightforward and comes across clearly and the preview ends with a nice punch. Hopefully the movie possesses the full spirit that is captured in this well-made trailer.

","It takes under a minute until you know what kind of movie this is going to be, some sort of slapstick comedy. It's not a bad thing, not at all and it started quite funny. An impressive number of stars in this film. George Clooney is the one that really stands out, and Ewan McGregor is also good. Of course they are the leads so they are the ones you see most but I feel the rest of the well known actors are just alright and nothing special. Their seriousness combined with the movies silly tone works well. But about half ways in I get the feeling it's starting to drag. Some funny bits appear now and then but the plot is just blank. Sure there is a story but it's neither interesting or even really funny. One gets the feeling it's just there to connect a bunch of jokes together. The movie has minimal action so if anyone thinks it's a war film then it's not, the war parts are nothing more than a set piece. Soon one realises that jokes can't carry the movie as a whole. Like I wrote earlier about half ways my concentration begins to dip, I stop caring where the plot is heading. When it ends I shrug my shoulders and nothing more. Not a bad 90 min but neither that good either. Sure slapstick comedies seldom, maybe never have any really substance but this film had absolutely nothing underneath. Because there is no real character development I don't care much for the ending. Not that there is something particularly wrong at the end but it just feels like nothing. That several things make no sense I've long stopped thinking about, but I suppose one can't expect that from a comedy. <br/><br/>My reaction leans to the negative. A bit disappointed sadly. I figure I was expecting something more from this. It's not a very bad movie but it's not good either. If you see it you sure will feel it's an somewhat enjoyable 90 min. But my verdict is no more than 5/10."

I would've sooner given him an Oscar nomination for this than for any of his dramatic movies. Jeff Bridges is... uninspired casting. This role is too similar to his very memorable one in The Big Lebowski. The casting of Kevin Spacey is quite uninspired as well. I'm quite tired of seeing him as smarmy villains. Actually I think he comes across as smarmy in most roles, which is probably why I never really liked him.

"KnightsofNi11","5","1","4","19 August 2010"," An all star cast can't save this misconstrued story
","The Men Who Stare at Goats has one of the most talented cast lineups that could possibly be arranged in this day and age. Three out of the four leads are Oscar winners with long and excellent careers. George Clooney won for Syriana in 2005, Jeff Bridges won for Crazy Heart in 2009, and Kevin Spacey won for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and again in 1999 for American Beauty. The fourth lead, Ewan McGregor has also had a successful career, surely with much more to come. This kind of lineup would be any directors field day, so it was quite a shame when this film ended up not coming together at all. It ends up being a disjointed jumble of scenes with an underdeveloped plot and underdeveloped characters with poor motivation. It was quite depressing to watch such a talented group of actors crash and burn in this poorly written and poorly directed schlock film.<br/><br/>The Men Who Stare at Goats begins with a great concept. It is about a journalist named Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) who wants to go and report in Iraq during the war to prove to his ex-wife that he is a responsible and respectable man. While in Iraq he meets Lyn Cassaday (George Clooney). Cassaday tells Wilton about how he was part of a secret military organization back in the 80's called Project Jedi. Project Jedi's initiative was to train psychic soldiers that fought with their mind instead of weapons. The whole idea is absurd and hilarious, and the best part is that the movie begins with a disclaimer reading: ""More of this is true than you would believe."" It leaves most of the truth up to speculation and up to viewer discretion to decide what really happened with this wacky secret operation. This concept would have been great if the flow of this film had any sort of coherence and a much better sense of direction.<br/><br/>While Wilton and Cassaday are trying to reach their destination in Iraq there are many flashbacks which explain the history of Project Jedi. These flashbacks are thrown in at very random points that break the flow of the film, making it feel very strange and out of place. And because there are so many flashbacks about 75% of the story in this film is the story told within the flashbacks. The storyline set in present day seems to be put on the back burner and by the end of the film it feels very underdeveloped, as well as Ewan McGregor's character which only appears in the present day scenes. This is a recipe for disaster when the flashbacks lead up to where Cassaday and Wilton find themselves at the rushed ending of the film. My interest gradually faded amidst the disjointed middle of the film, and the ending was so out of place and strangely executed that my interest never returned.<br/><br/>All this being said, The Men Who Stare at Goats is a fairly funny film. It was marketed as an absurd comedy with an all star cast. It meets these requirements, yet doesn't excel like you would think. I admittedly laughed out loud during this film, and a lot of the time this can save a film for me. The problem here, however, was that even though the movie was set up as a comedy, it tried too hard to be so much more as the story progressed. It had elements of comedy, drama, action, and even sci-fi, ultimately getting lost in itself. If the movie hadn't taken itself so seriously it might have succeeded slightly more. On the other side of the coin, this film had such a robust cast that you would hope it would take itself seriously, so as not to be another silly Will Ferrell comedy (not saying I don't enjoy his movies but we all know what to expect when walking into a Ferrell movie). This paradox unfortunately construes this film into a mess of genres that drive the film head first into the ground, causing it to be an untimely disaster.<br/><br/>An interesting concept and fantastic cast save this film from being absolutely terrible, but it still leaves so much to be desired. With a more seasoned director and writer that could handle this film with more care and precision, it could have been great. Or if it had been about a half hour longer, so as to fully develop the story and characters, and fine tune the mishmash of genres it presents. The Men Who Stare at Goats is an unfortunate waste of talent."

Convinced there's some reality to this after all, Bob follows Lyn on a mission. Eventually they're kidnapped and other craziness -- the film also mixes in Bob's narration of the history of this group of soldiers.<br/><br/>The movement, called the New Earth Army, was started by Mr. hippie himself, Jeff Bridges as Bill Django. The men called themselves ""Jedi warriors,"" which as a Star Wars fan, makes the scene where McGregor asks about Jedi possibly the funniest in the film.<br/><br/>Peter Straughan's screenplay, adapted by the Jon Ronson book, is where it starts going wrong. The jumping back to explain the New Earth Army mixed in with the modern plot starts to work at first, but when there's nothing all the exciting to reveal about the NWA, it stops increasing our interest in what's going on in the present. <br/><br/>Director Grant Heslov is not the source of the problem technically speaking, but any lack of purpose in a film means the director is going to take some shots.<br/><br/>""Goats"" is simply not what it's made out to be. The trailer does not take into account the chronological structure of the film and so it looks like a story being told about the NWA, not a reporter learning about it to no important end.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","Bob (Ewan McGregor) is a newspaper reporter who lives in Ann Arbor and is married to his longtime sweetheart. However, one day, his wife jilts him for the paper's editor. Heartbroken, Bob accepts an assignment in war-torn Iraq. While waiting to enter the country, he spies a contractor, Lyn (George Clooney) at a poolside restaurant in Kuwait. But, ho ho ho! Lyn is not really a businessman but an army agent of secret operatives. His main strength, as he tells it, is his ""jedi"" training, which includes visions and mind-control. Although he won't reveal his present mission, he agrees to take Bob to Baghdad. Of course, things go wrong from the get-go, as Lyn is a bad driver who hits an enormous rock and wrecks the car. Waiting for a rescue, the duo is, instead, captured by the enemy and in dire straits. Can Lyn's powers really execute an escape? In the meanwhile, the ""jedi"" relates the story of his training to Bob. It was oddball Bill (Jeff Bridges) who recruited him for this ""new age"" military operations. A Vietnam veteran, Bill sampled everything from hallucinogens to Native American mythology to martial arts to formulate a well-rounded technique. Trouble was, Larry (Kevin Spacey), as a jealous member of the team, often put a spanner into the works. But, never mind that. Can Lyn still work miracles? This is one of those ""soda pop"" films which start off with a great deal of fizz and go completely flat. No, its not the cast, for they are very fine indeed, as Clooney, McGregor, Bridges, Spacey and company make the most of every line. Also, the concept of the film is good, as are the costumes, scenery and the like. But, the script, which begins so well, ends up going nowhere until it reaches a ridiculous sort of finale. What a big shame! Even so, there are flashes of brilliance and some great one-liners. Therefore, if you like the cast members or ""different drummer"" type films, you might take a chance on the DVD. Interesting failures are, at times, good for a one-time view."
"dbborroughs","7","1","4","21 December 2009"," Good but overly silly
","This is the fictionalized story of a reporter who got on the trail of America's Psi warriors. These were, and are, a group of men trying to find ways of waging war via decidedly unconventional means such as psychic mind control and remote viewing. The film follows Ewan McGregor, as a reporter, who decides to go to Kuwait during the Gulf War and then on into Iraq , only to find he can't find away to go to where the action is. Instead he meets George Clooney and ends up on a wild ride into Iraq and into the world of the psychic soldiers.<br/><br/>The film takes a straight forward book and pumps up the humor factor for its own purposes. The result is that much of material comes off as a decidedly silly send up of government running amok in the wrong direction. I'm not sure that the material really needed the puffing since what actually happened in some cases was actually funny enough on its own terms. The titled event, the story of a man staring at a goat in an effort to kill it with his mind, resulted in the man staring at the animal for something like 36 hours until it keeled over. I heard the book's author Jon Ronson on the radio and he is pretty sure that the goat just fell over from exhaustion rather than anything that was done to it by the person staring at it. The film turns it into something else entirely. What the soldiers go through is every ""new age"" joke, when apparently the real soldiers played it much more seriously. As someone who's read about the military's attempts at using these unconventional means I was kind of disappointed that they played it so silly. Did all of these guys really need to be so crazy? I enjoyed it but at the same time I didn't love it like I thought I should have, I some how felt that it was too condescending. Very well acted its clear that everyone making the film was having a good time and that the film was a labor of love. The fact that everyone in the cast was really having a good time helps to sell the material more than it deserves.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's a good but not great film and worth a look."

"Tweekums","8","1","5","9 July 2011"," A Jedi in Iraq!
","I had heard fairly mixed reviews of this film but as the only clip I'd seen was very funny I thought I'd give it a go when it was on television; I'm glad I did as it was laugh out loud funny. Ewan McGregor plays Bob Wilton a journalist who heads off to war torn Iraq when his wife leaves him. While waiting at a hotel near the border he meets Lyn Cassady; a man who he had heard about before; a man who had apparently been part of a secret US Army Psychic Corps known as The New Earth Army. At first Lyn isn't too keen to discuss matters but when he sees a doodle Bob has drawn he believes that the two of them are meant to head into Iraq together as part of his mission. As they go into Iraq where they will have to deal with local insurgents, trigger-happy 'contractors' and finally Lyn's nemesis from his army days; Bob reads Lyn's diary and we see how the New Earth Army came to be and was later disbanded. Bob is understandably sceptical about Lyn's talk of psychic powers and soon regrets going with him although as Lyn says, 'it is his destiny'.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor does a good job as Bob but George Clooney stole the show as Lyn; he played the role dead straight making him far funnier than if he'd played it for laughs. Even the secondary characters were played by well-known actors including Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and Robert Patrick. It was fairly clear early on that things were be played for laughs Clooney referred to the men of the New Earth Army as Jedi and Ewan 'Obi Wan Kenobi' McGregor had no idea what he meant! There isn't too much to offend people in this film although the language is quite strong in places and there is a brief scene featuring topless women; the camera never lingered though. I wasn't too keen on the very last scene as it gave the answer to the question 'are they really able to do the things Lyn claimed', I'd have preferred it if that was left up to the viewer; it is however a minor quibble and I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to watch something a little different and have a laugh."

"ebiros2","3","1","6","10 December 2016"," Irritatingly stupid movie
","After seeing this movie, I could only surmise that it's some kind of disinformation film to make jokes out of what is commonly known as remote viewing. The movie portrays remote viewers as army's attempt to train soldiers to be new age hippies (seriously). From what I've read the real remote viewers were deadly effective (otherwise the government wouldn't have funded them for 23 years). But if the effectiveness of remote viewing was really conveyed, it would be disclosing one of the closely guarded secrets of US military operations. So my take after seeing the movie is that it was created to be a disinformation campaign to make the world believe that this is what remote viewing is about. None of the characters in the movie could do remote viewing. As if it didn't exist. And maybe that's the real message this movie wanted to convey."
"toll-8","4","1","6","30 May 2012"," Some good humour but not enough to enthrall you.
","This is a review where I don't really know where to start. For those of you that have seen this film will understand why as it is a very strange experience. The film centres round the idea that the U.S Army set up a separate unit that trained soldiers to fight with their minds rather than weapons, in order to make an attempt at peace. This is apparently based on a true story and I have to say it is so unbelievable it may well be true.<br/><br/>We begin with Ewan McGregor who plays a journalist who has just split up with his wife. In a way to make himself look like he is over the break he heads to Kuwait in an attempt to report on a big story in neighbouring Iraq. Once there he meets a man whose name came up in an interview he took part in a few months earlier. The interview was with a guy who was part of a new unit within the army that trained to kill things with their minds. This man mentions one guy as the only one to ever do it; this guy is George Clooney, who McGregor meets when in Kuwait.<br/><br/>Clooney agrees to the journalist tagging along with him into Iraq and McGregor heads on to a journey he will never quite be able to explain. Their journey is due to Clooney believing he is on a top secret mission and he begins to tell McGregor about it which ends up in many flashbacks showing how this army unit came about. We see Jeff Bridges become a hippy and force army officers to dance. We also get Kevin Spacey attempting to guess an object inside a hidden box. The whole process of this seems ridiculous and it really pokes fun at the army. The two continue their journey across the Iraq desert, coming across many ludicrous hurdles that only a man who can kill a goat with the power of his mind can jump over. The film generally is told in flashbacks, which shows the rise and fall of two key characters as this new found unit is developed. <br/><br/>The plot sounds crazy and by sure the film is. Much of it is very funny and it mainly comes from people believing they can jump through walls or that simply thinking someone won't shoot you is enough to stop them from doing it - added on after this speech is the line, 'and then you stab them in the neck with a nearby pen,' which completely defeats the purpose of stopping the violence. This however works for this film as this is where the dry humour comes from, the fact that these ""Jedi Warriors"" as Clooney calls them, believe that they are in fact doing it all with their mind. This is an absolute tribute to the writing as the dialogue is brilliant and the dry humour delivered in ironic one liners really hits the spot. <br/><br/>A problem with the writing though is that there isn't really much of a story to get yourself attached to. The first part of the film is interesting and the middle section involving the mind techniques is funny but the final third becomes a little dull and by this point I didn't really care. The film worked better when it was told in flashbacks which unfortunately meant there was no real story. The initial idea is intriguing but I think, other than the dialogue, the writing really falls flat.<br/><br/>The actors are on top form though. Clooney is brilliant as the best man in his business, and his scene where he stares at a goat is great. Bridges is also at ease and brings humour and a life to his role. Spacey is also on good form despite his short screen time. He is rather menacing here and all because he can't master the mind technique. McGregor drives the story from the beginning and his bewilderment as the story unravels relates to the audiences reaction.<br/><br/>The film is a little disappointing and it is only really the acting and dialogue that can gain positive reports. Some of the lines for Clooney had me in stitches and the entire bizarreness will have you baffled, however it doesn't help the film really being a disappointment. Some of it is enjoyable and I wish that it would have been better.<br/><br/>2 / 5<br/><br/>Fir more reviews and news: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","Lets start by saying this movie contains a great cast and a very good idea but. I watched in anticipation waiting for something more to hit me and it never came. The idea that the government would spend millions if not billions of dollars on an idea to stay ahead of another country certainly isn't a new idea. I would not have thought about this one though. That alone makes this movie interesting. Where does it go from there? <br/><br/>This is an offbeat buddy film that contains good chemistry between the two main characters George Clooney and Ewan Mcgregor but again there was nothing that reached out and slapped you in the face. <br/><br/>If this movie is on your list to watch, I would say watch it and judge for yourself as the characters, acting and the idea are worth it."

There he meets Lyn, whom is involved with a secret government project where they use their minds to control things. Lyn calls himself a jedi and says Bob must have some in him too since he sketched a picture of the jedi eye. The middle of the film is them two getting captured, escaping, and traveling across the desert. Then the ending had something to do with spiking the water with LSD and letting all the goats and prisoners escape.<br/><br/>The film was not interesting enough to keep your attention and keep up with what's going on.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: There are much better Clooney movies than this.

Failing that, as 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' does, I at least want to walk out with some zingers for the water cooler. But wouldn't you know it, practically every gag and comedic situation in this film falls flat. <br/><br/>""Oh, no doubt it's got the makings of a great comedy -- an A-list cast, a treasure lode of material for satire, topicality. But the graceless directing, which renders the jokes badly timed and too insistent by half, does a tidy job of canceling those out. And then of course there's the  shapeless  narrative ..."" <br/><br/>Don's take: ""We all know 'em. They are stubborn in their beliefs. Their beliefs form the cores of their souls; they define them. If the truth is contrary to what they believe, even if it is plain as day, staring them in the face, they'll find a way to continue to believe They'll make logical leaps, will assign meaning to the meaningless; they'll even dismiss cold hard facts in service of their beliefs. Take, for example, believers in the Loch Ness Monster, or conspiracy theorists.<br/><br/>""Leading the cast of 'The Men Who Stare At Goats' is George Clooney who is earnest and funny as the woefully deluded 'psychic' spy, Lyn Cassady. So deep in his delusion is he that at one point, he takes credit for the dissolution of a cloud. 'Cloud bursting,' he proclaims. 'It keeps me in shape.' <br/><br/>""A charming and affable Clooney stands out in an otherwise mediocre film that will quickly be forgotten but is perfectly serviceable as a winter diversion during what has been a slow season for movies. He revisits the wackiness we enjoyed so much in his turn as Ulysses Everett McGill in 'O Brother Where Art Thou,' and seems to be having a great time doing it; it rubs off a little on you. The film is not replete with gut-busting laughs like I had hoped, but I did find myself smiling easily throughout most of the film thanks in large part to Clooney's performance and I did laugh out loud a handful of times.""<br/><br/>Please visit our blog and read our full reviews.

The jokes are only slightly funny and in a whole there is no real story. this would not be a problem per se but the fact that the story is situated partially to the irak, a country that has been attacked but the USA for made up reasons, the story is pathetic and a shame for the western world.Sorry, i like the actors but this was not a piece of art, but more a party of the actors."

The movie did show a soldier staring at a goat and supposedly killing it, and how goats were used in real life to train surgeons to dress combat wounds.<br/><br/>The movie does have some laughs; the general running into a wall, Cassady looking at a cloud while driving and using his mental powers to disperse a cloud-and crashing into a rock because he wasn't paying attention to his driving. But the storyline is mostly weird and confusing, and it would have been better if it has kept up with the suggestion (in the scene where the kidnappers had locked up the reporter and Cassady) that the psychic soldiers' ""powers"" were really just the deception and trickery used in stage magic.

We've all heard the stories of the soldiers asked to stare at goats, to try and harm them. It's funny, it's stupid, and it could have been a wonderful satire. The film, however, has too much focus on a road trip style narrative, with too many flashbacks. You're never sure where the film is coming from, or where it's going.

"estreet-eva","5","0","4","5 December 2011"," Funny, if you ignore the tax implications.
","""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" starts off with the great warning that you don't want to know how many of the stories are true; this is particularly true if you have paid U.S. taxes during the past 40 years. The movie dramatizes actual U.S. military programs including one that spanned several decades and consumed tens of millions of taxpayer money after the Cold War military was conned into believing that our Soviet opponents were developing ""psychic"" powers. It also covers stories of U.S. paid military contractors who wound up shooting at each other again a dramatization but based on real and embarrassing events. The deliciousness of these tales is the movie's strength but also its weakness as the throwaway plot that is woven around them about Ewan McGregor's jilted newspaper reporter trying to impress this ex-wife by traveling to the Iraqi war zone feels very tacked on. Speaking of McGregor, he shares the screen with what may be the most impressive current male cast possible; props to the casting agent who secured Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and George Clooney each of whom would have been a monster ""get"" for any movie. Ultimately however, once the stories of the military's foray in new age nonsense and imperialism-on-the-cheap of the Iraqi invasion are told there is not a terribly lot for them to do. Still it is hard to not recommend a movie with a cast this stellar - it might just be worth it to see Jeff Bridges jaw-dropping aging from an energetic hippie general to alcoholic shadow of his former self."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","3","5 December 2011"," Generally well reigned in and free of any really nasty; the film can be episodic and often staggers around, but it is a dizzy black comedy I generally took to.
","The film begins with a male character, of whom we have to presume is of a rather informed ilk given the certificates and qualifications draped over his office walls, doing something we conclude to be rather stupid. Staring intensely at a wall opposite him, focusing on it as if his life depended on it, the individual takes a running charge before meeting the stretch of plaster and mortar head on and rebounding backwards - landing painfully on his back. Thus begins the commonplace tone of the film; that is to say, its following of somewhat informed people, with very specific experiences in life, shambling their way into situations that were always going to get a lot worse before they got any better following a string of misguided conscientious decisions.<br/><br/>For the most part, The Men Who Stare at Goats covers a certain Bob Wilton, played by Ewan McGregor; a journalist based in the state of Michigan who voluntarily ends up in The Middle East when a longtime female partner leaves him for a three-limed wielding combat veteran of whom, in her estimation, is the better catch. His escape from this arrives in the venturing to the nation of Kuwait, wherein he will meet up with a man in the form of Lyn Cassady (Clooney) – a man initially dismissed as a bit of a kook, but a man Wilton decides to stick things out with when it transpires he has a back-story to do with certain lost divisions of the American Army. Wilton, angry out of the collapse of his partnership with a woman that left him for a man who fought for his country and experienced warfare to the degree that he did, appears to do what he does in The Middle East out of an immense feeling of inferiority. What Wilton uncovers is the fact that Cassady was more involved in a department built on both the research and practise of people eliminating others via the power they wield in their minds - a sort of murderous telepathy designed to strike down the enemy without even raising a finger.<br/><br/>Initially dismissing the idea as nonsense, the film covers Wilton's inception into Cassady's world of psychological warfare and illicit mind-tricks apparently capable of dropping an enemy on the strength of concentration and mental verve. Needless to say, it is Wilton's film wherein we may see him uncover the makeshift reality of the situation Cassady talks about, and this is in spite of the fact Clooney and his character steal the show as both a foil and as something allowing Wilton to put aside his marital issues and get involved in something genuinely engaging aside from faux-quests of masculinity. The film covers the pair of them hitting the road so as to travel to Iraq - something which will lead them closer to, amongst other things, those of whom Cassady speaks that were always more broadly linked to the mind control division; the film mutating into a buddy comedy road movie of sorts, the juxtaposition of falling back onto something as familiar and as carefree as such whilst delivering this wild premise working to decent success.<br/><br/>During the trip, Cassady's back-story involving a spaced out Jeff Bridges character and this meeting through a bit of an episode in the Vietnam War is told parallel with the present trek; a bumping into an American contractor sees Robert Patrick do his best in reenacting that of what Ben Kingsley pulled off in the recent, and similarly toned, 2008 film ""War Inc."", as this brash and seemingly spoof all-powerful; all-conquering optimisation of America's attitude on foreign affairs. The film is about a story which is ultimately, and away from the offbeat nature of it as well as the quirksome nature of what transpires throughout, tragic and doom-laden.<br/><br/>There is an eventual sense of immense sadness as to how these men linked to this specific American Army division come to just observe their lives capitulate around them. Yet the director, a certain Grant Heslov and here treading a very fine line very well, has the guts to construct certain things about these happenings as quite funny; as if we might find it amusing. The film just about gets away with it, primarily out of the fact these men and their world is explored from the perspective of an outsider raw to what those therein have been involved in all this time – the film is an amusing comedy but a sad film depicting weary people with beliefs they've held on to for years beginning to fall apart before their very eyes. We enjoy certain episodes within and the odd couple pairing of the journalist with the soldier; the masculinity indulging, looking for warfare Wilton with the ultimately pacifist Cassady – itself a pairing amusingly subverting what we might typically expect of a respective Clooney and McGregor role. On other occasions, it falls over its feet when a kidnap sequence on account of some insurgents feels trivialised when flashbacks to the wacky past quench the horror of the present situation, but flaws aside, and there are rather-a few, the film treads water enough for it to make the grade."

They're members of an elite, covert military unit - known officially as the New Earth Army and unofficially as Jedi warriors - trained to use New Age mysticism and psychic powers to defeat the enemy (their staring at the goats is supposed to result in the animals' deaths). Bob Wilton is a newspaper reporter from Ann Arbor, Michigan who becomes personally involved with the unit while serving as a war correspondent in Iraq. He's drawn in by a retired Special Forces operator by the name of Lyn Cassady who lets Wilton in on some of his most closely guarded secrets.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Jon Ralston, ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" claims to be based on fact.<br/><br/>As that rare dark satire that takes on militarism and war as targets, Grant Heslov's ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" gets more points for guts and daring than it does for execution. Its points often lack clarity and focus and the hijinks occasionally feel too much like leftovers from ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22"" for total comfort. Yet, there are enough offbeat and humorous moments to more than compensate for the frequent concept that backfires or the occasional joke that falls flat. The basic premise of the story seems to be that since war is the province of madmen and fools, who better fit to wage it? And in the topsy-turvy world of Peter Straughan's screenplay, even the counterculture concept of hippy-dippy pacifism gets co-opted by the military machine.<br/><br/>The acting throughout is first-rate. George Clooney is so entertaining as the half-brilliant/half-mad Cassady that he makes the movie worth seeing for his performance alone. Add to that a host of fine performances by Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey and you have a flawed but occasionally compelling work"

","I was so excited when I heard that a film was coming out about Remote Viewing - but this isn't even ""remotely"" connected to remote viewing, except loosely... very loosely!<br/><br/>The real project was not about spacey flower children - this was ridiculous! As for it being a comedy, I guess I would call it light-hearted, but I never laughed. (The reviewer who said they fell on the floor laughing throughout the movie must have been smoking something green!)<br/><br/>The best thing about this flick, to me, is that I got to see a lot of George Clooney - and with long hair yet! I always love the laid-back, dry humor of Clooney's characters, so I did in fact enjoy this to some extent. That said, the film was so far removed from the real remote viewing project that it should have been made an incidental part of the plot instead of masquerading as the basis."

","It is a satiric war comedy, as a war-themed feature, it's more unconventional than JARHEAD (2005), which doesn't not prevent the paranormal paranoid backdrop confidently brings a sense of novelty at the beginning.<br/><br/>The present story and the flashbacks intwines smoothly, the mysterious Jedi troop set piece is hilarious because of Ewan's presence. However, who would expect that with its unabashed boldness, the second part all of a sudden lost its fuel, tastes like some kind of cheesy pastiche of M*A*S*H (1970), hurries to find a way to reach the end, no matter what it is.<br/><br/>The all-male cast is at large squandered, the only exception is George Clooney, who exert himself to be convincing and entertaining as the same time, Ewan is barely detectable as his character is so stock, but at least it is my guilty pleasure to see him in his quasi-innocent devotion while Jeff and Kevin unfortunately need more space to prove their capacity.<br/><br/>The film could become a smart war parody and inject a deeper percussion to the audience's senses, as a cinephile it is rather hurt to witness a great idea gone wild.<br/><br/>One advice, I saw the DVD in two separate days, my gut feeling is that if one watches it from start to end as a whole, maybe it will emancipate a slightly better appreciation."

","Having heard the journalist, Jon Ronson, who wrote the book on which this film is based interviewed a couple of times I was intrigued to see this one. Unfortunately, these interviews were all broadcast around the time of the cinema release and I never got the opportunity to see it. Fortunately, it arrived on the BBC just over a year later and so my curiosity was finally satisfied. My thoughts later, but here's a short summary first (summary haters please stare at those goats over there while I write the next paragraph sorry, I couldn't resist that one).<br/><br/>When journalist, Bob Wilton, is separated from his wife in 2002, he decides to go to Iraq to prove himself to her. Here he meets Lyn Skip Cassady, an ex-member of the U.S. Army's New Earth Army. What's that I hear you say, well, it's a special unit set up in the 1980's to look into using psychic powers as a means of winning a war. The unit was headed by Bill Django who had spent many years studying the ways of the more free-spirited Americans. As Bob and Lyn travel through Iraq Bob learns more about the work of the unit and how he may be involved in the secret mission Lyn is currently on. In flashback we learn that Lyn had a nemesis back at the unit, Larry Hooper, who was to turn up again before the end of the mission.<br/><br/>Although I did find a lot of the humour in this one quite funny, I did find the story a little weak. It's a pretty well made film with some good performances but I felt a little let down by the plot, particularly the end. Performance wise, George Clooney never missed a beat as Lyn Skip Cassady, Ewan McGregor was OK as Bob Wilton, but he wasn't really stretched, Jeff Bridges did a great impression of 'The Dude' as Bill Django and Kevin Spacey again wasn't at all stretched as Larry Hooper.<br/><br/>I found it funny that a film starring Ewan McGregor featured an Army unit that called itself 'The Jedi'. And there are plenty of other little jokes like this throughout the film. If it wasn't for George Clooney and Jeff Bridges I guess I would have given a lower score, but they just about pushed it to a 6.5 for me. So, over all, if slightly unsatisfying, it's still worth seeing for Messer's Clooney and Bridges alone Recommended (just).<br/><br/>My score: 6.5/10"

","I love the employment of flashbacks. They're an efficient way to develop both character and storyline. Have you noticed the mocumentary format becoming increasingly popular in television shows (The Office, Modern Family, Arrested Development, Parks And Recreation, Family Guy)? One of the major advantages of such a format is that flashbacks are easily incorporated into the plot and I believe this has lead to much of their success. The Men Who Stare at Goats certainly takes advantage of this new technique while incorporating superior acting and story development.<br/><br/>One of the things I really loved about this movie, besides the closeness I felt with its characters, was its oblivious comedic slant. A few times I wasn't sure if I should have been laughing, but I didn't care because it was too damn funny. The movie teetered between being funny and knowing it, and being funny and not knowing it. Sometimes the movie knew it was a comedy, and other times it thought it was a war based conspiracy film. But for different reasons, it was always funny and entertaining."

","George S. Kaufman said, ""'Satire' is what closes on Saturday night,"" and the vicious one-star reviews of this film seem to prove he's still right. Viewers who hated this wonderful movie probably thought Dr Strangelove was just a comedy that wasn't too funny and Catch 22 was an overlong bore. This film turns the Make Love Not War pablum bowl upside down and dumps it all over war itself. It matches new age drivel with teapot machismo and anyone who finds both extremes tiresome and dangerous can only laugh with recognition and delight.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>When his personal life takes a knock, Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) goes off to become a reporter in Iraq, as the war takes off in 2003. Whilst there, he crosses paths with Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), a former soldier himself who tells him about a man in the Vietnam war called Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), a free spirit who showed the best way to defeat the enemy is with the mind. From here, we follow the adventures of the two men applying this philosophy to modern war, until their encounter with disciplinarian commanding officer Hooper (Kevin Spacey) who's determined to have his way or the high way.<br/><br/>The title alone should give some indication of this film being aimed at a particular type of audience, those that prefer the quirkier, more off beat type of film, and the typical type of cast that would go with it. As such, it's an occasionally funny, relatively well made piece that is refreshingly brief and so doesn't become too self indulgent or wavey. It's none of the cast's finest hour, and they've surely done this type of thing better somewhere else before, but it's a distracting and subversive enough piece, that will probably find a cult audience with some. ***"

Clooney is so darn good at putting his crackpot character across that he almost has you believing he is what he believes he is, a ""Super Soldier"" with ""Jedi"" powers! It's all here: remote viewing, astral projection, the death touch, greeny whackos, mind enhancement using LSD, etc. What a hoot! Bridges is great as the officer who succeeds in actually getting the US Army to back his hippie training program. MacGregor is also perfect as the gullible ne'er-do-well desperate to believe in something greater than himself, but taking all the wrong turns to find it. Spacey is menacing as the proponent of the ""Dark Side"" of the force. The director has learned much from the Coens, and this is definitely their sort of movie, so if you like the Coens, you'll like this! A lot of people don't seem to get this film, but that's OK.

","An only fitfully funny comedy about a journalist (Ewan McGregor) who teams up with an ex-special agent (George Clooney) when he (the journalist) suspects that there's quite a scoop to be found in the agent's history. The film obviously thinks we're going to think it's quite a scoop too, as it employs all manner of self-consciously cutesy hijinks in telling its story about a unit of the U.S. armed forces that tried to harness psychic powers (among other things) in finding non-violent means of combat. The problem is that the story lurches along in fits and starts; the screenwriter stops the flow of action every five minutes or so to give us backstory, some of it relevant, some of it not. As a result, neither narrative thread ever has a chance to build any momentum, and though the running time of the film is tight (a mere 90 minutes) it feels like it meanders on forever.<br/><br/>I guess we're supposed to be tickled by the sight of well-known and Oscar-winning actors (like Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey in addition to Clooney) goofing off, but it's the lone non-Oscar winning member of the cast (McGregor) who comes off best.<br/><br/>My parents reviled this movie and had me prepared for a stinker.

"brando647","7","0","1","25 May 2010"," Poor Execution Weakens What Could've Been a Great Film
","All of the pieces are in place for a wicked cool movie: great cast, great premise, Boston (the band, not the city). There was no reason for this film to be anything less than awesome, but it was. The film is based on the book of the same name from Jon Ronson, regarding the US military's experimentation with New Age tactics in the 1970s ranging from phasing (moving through solid objects), invisibility, and the ability to kill a subject through staring and concentration. The film modifies the concept a bit, centering on a reporter (Ewan McGregor) who meets a man claiming to be a reactivated operative from the military's New Earth Army (George Clooney). The reporter joins him on his secretive mission into the heart of Iraq and learns the history of how the New Earth Army was formed and what tore it to pieces.<br/><br/>Based on that description alone, I almost want to watch the film again right now. The premise is that cool, and the cast is just as encouraging. As I'd mentioned, George Clooney is Lyn Cassady, one of the original members of the New Earth Army who acts as the guide into the history and strange ways of the unit. Clooney is one of my favorite actors and the man can do funny. I love his deadpan delivery of his character's lines, explaining with all seriousness how he once killed a goat with only his thoughts or what exactly the ""sparkly eyes technique"" is. His character 100% believes everything he's saying and it makes you want to believe too. Jeff Bridges was the highlight of the film as Colonel Bill Django, founder of the New Earth Army. Bridges summons a bit of the Dude (from THE BIG LEBOWSKI) as the stoned out New Age colonel dishing out mantras and encouraging his soldiers to ""be all they could be"" (the proposed origin of the Army slogan). Kevin Spacey is great as the film's ""villain"", Larry Hooper. Hooper was a late addition to Django's program and developed an almost juvenile hatred/resentment at Cassady's success in the program. I love Spacey here and really wish we'd gotten some more of him. The film's last major player, Ewan McGregor as reporter Bob Wilton, does a fine job but wilts against the skills of his castmates. His character is primarily around to freak out in tense moments and acts as the source of exposition so the audience can learn about the New Earth Army as he does.<br/><br/>So how can this film turn out so mediocre with so much going for it? Poor execution. As I was first watching the film, for the longest time I couldn't actually determine what the plot was. The first hour of the movie is essentially a road movie with the history of the New Earth Army told in flashbacks. But I couldn't determine what the central conflict was? What was the goal? What exactly are we building up to? The answer: not much of anything. The final 30 minutes of the film fall a bit flat with a real weak climax. It's almost as if director Grant Heslov wrote out the first hour loaded with flashbacks, remembered later on that he needed some sort of ending, and tossed this one together at the last minute. As for the film's humor, it isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as the trailer leads one to believe. Honestly, and I hate to say this, a lot of the best moments are in the trailer (including most of Spacey's and all of Bridges'). The film does have some other funny material filling it out, but it falters at times.<br/><br/>Still, I can't hate on the movie too much. It's got all the best ingredients; it's just that someone fudged up the recipe and it came out flat. I may not include it amongst my most loved movies (as much as I wish I could), but it's still a decently entertaining 90 minutes that's good for a lazy afternoon viewing."

","This is an odd little movie. There are odd characters who have odd experiences in odd locations, all revolving around an odd topic. Whether this collective montage is deserving of being committed to film is questionable because the central topic cannot be explored in any substantial, relevant way for an audience.<br/><br/>O.k., so the military has done some research on alternative weaponry, namely psychic ability. And, o.k., there are people who have more evolved psychic powers. And, hey, wouldn't it be great if there was a way to harness psychic energy to fight a war? It sure would be a way to reduce the defense budget and it might be more humane. It might even be a way to end acts of war since our enemies wouldn't be quite sure how much we know of their plans or of the extent of our destructive potential.<br/><br/>But this movie is not science fiction; you are not asked to suspend belief. It's about an idea whose time has not yet come. Like cars that fly or transporters that reassemble atoms from one place to another. The funny part of the story is when this idea is given some serious attention by the military which has to appoint some unusual personality types to implement the research. The serious side of the story is the goal - war games. In between is the whack-a-do vocabulary of the characters, all New Age, Jedi, mind expanding phrases and notions. The tragedy of war is obvious; the comedy of war is much more difficult to portray even though TV's MASH and Hogan's Heroes did it. Goats doesn't do either very well simply because there is no sequence of dramatic events to hang the story on, no matter how hard the film makers try. <br/><br/>In the end, Goats is not comedy, drama, sci-fi, thriller, action movie, etc. It's a cork board with some random facts push-pinned to it. But I have to give this film 5 stars because of the earnestness of the actors, screenwriter, director and supporting crew who try to make it into something."

","There apparently was a ""New Age Army"" back in the 1983, and they apparently did have a Psychops (psychological operations) branch, but this movie is based on a book, and while the main characters are based on real soldiers, I have to believe it is mostly a work of fiction.<br/><br/>Scotsman Ewan McGregor is an American writer, Bob Wilton. He is in Kuwait searching a story when he meets George Clooney as Lyn Cassady. He remembered the name from some interviews he did with a former Psychops member, and they started their modern day (2003) journey.<br/><br/>The movie has some interesting, and laugh-out-loud, moments, but overall is disjointed and seemingly random, and comes down to a series of episodes of the strange things these men apparently did. Then when you get to the end (spoilers below) you wonder what the purpose is.<br/><br/>It also features Jeff Bridges as Bill Django and Kevin Spacey as Larry Hooper, both former members of the Psychops operation, but now (2003) involved in some non-military operations.<br/><br/>SPOILER: Bob Wilton ends up getting his story, and NBC does a spot. But the only thing that appears (the real Ann Curry simulating a news cast) is that certain captives are tortured by forcing them to listen to a certain children's song for 24 hours straight. Back in the office Bob, inspired by being with Cassady all those weeks and hearing what they could do, decided he would run through the wall and into the next office, and he does!

Where movies like Burn After Reading can balance a serious tone with a cartoony centre, The Men Who Stare at Goats is really unsure what sort of genre it's really going for. From shoot outs to slapstick, kidnapping to carpet jumping, the movie never feels like its hitting the right spot, always going down with a soggy after taste. Same goes for the tread of plot that lingers through out its running time. Did I say plot? More like a random chain of events where one thing happens to set up someone falling over, so some other ridiculous events can take place. It's not that its uneventful, there is just no plot aim or goal. Even in the story there supposed to be just aimlessly walking about, which builds very little tension or adventure with the characters.<br/><br/>Having said that, this isn't all bad by any means. Great actors giving great performances, sure Kevin Spacy is a little under done and Ewan McGregor Scotsman pierces, but their having fun which makes the movie a lot more enjoyable.

","Supposedly based on true events, the movie has the protagonist - an out of luck journalist - become acquainted with a legend of the top-secret military psychic research program - an event which gives him an illusion of purpose in life.<br/><br/>Lyn Wescott - brilliantly played by Clooney - believes himself to be the last of the real-world Jedi - the only remaining ex-member of what used to be the New Earth Army, a secret unit formed by a neo-hippie with dreams of changing the world. Much had been said about the irony of the film and of the facts it was supposedly based on, but in my opinion that's not what the movie is about. Running deep in the storyline, told through Lynn's flashbacks to his time in the New Earth Army, is the theme of confrontation between dreams and reality. Lynn's mentor is a dreamer, a man who's deeply driven by his noble purpose - so deeply, in fact, that he can't even spot troubles germinating in his own ranks. And so is Lynn, his apt pupil. In their eyes, The New Earth Army is a major force for good, the representation of the archetypal Good in the world. The story of the NEA and its downfall, as recalled by Lynn, is the archetypal tale of the rise of a noble order and its betrayal by one of its own. Long after New Earth Army had been disbanded, Lynn is still trapped in the dream - so when he has a vision of his mentor calling him to the Iraqi desert, he doesn't hesitate to follow it.<br/><br/>The journalist, newly befriended by Lynn, becomes infected by their dream, as it gives him a sense of purpose and elevates him from being a divorced loser to becoming a warrior of Good. But, as Lynn and the traitorous Larry meet in Iraq, the latter reminds him that ""none of this was real"".<br/><br/>""The men who stare at goats"" are, deep down, the men in search for purpose. Their attempts to give their life a meaning are guided by the images and references from the popular culture, and they are themselves in turn unaware that their quest is, in fact, the quest for a modern myth in a world that lost touch with its roots."

It is a shifting tale started by a lovesick reporter (Ewan McGregor) who discovers a military secret concerning the Jedi Warriors - a post Vietnam group developed by on Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), a left over hippie who developed a line of psychic spies who could read minds and control events just by thinking.

Spill all of this into Iraq and a series of events that shows how absurd humans behave in war time and the fun never stops.

"DICK STEEL","7","0","2","30 March 2010"," A Nutshell Review: The Men Who Stare at Goats
","To say that The Men Who Stare at Goats is a quirky movie will be a gross understatement. There's a strong underlying anti-war message and the popular, contemporary environmental reminder featured heavily in the narrative, topped by generous loads of humour and a great cast to boot. It has to be seen to be believed just how crazy Peter Straughan's screenplay based upon the book by Jon Ronson can be, and therein lies the fun in the willingness of director Grant Heslov to experiment with such a film.<br/><br/>And speaking of experiments, the film supposedly takes on a true account - I'm still standing on that side of the fence that the events portrayed are too insane to be true - that chronicles the attempts by the US Army to develop a contingent of super soldiers with psychic abilities, where wars can be avoided by the collective will of their super beings to avert conflict through mind tricks and will power, while spreading the message of hippie love over senseless hatred. Generously funded, most of the fun came from the series of flashbacks where we get front row seats to some of the most absurd training techniques used by an armed forces.<br/><br/>There are enough jokes and references to Star Wars, its Jedi Knights and power akin to The Force that makes it all the more side-splitting when there is Ewan McGregor in a leading role expressing cluelessness about what they all mean. If I may say so, there's a moment where he's supposed to scoff at with disbelief, but let out a quick smile at being aware of just what they're about. After all, the actor had played one of the greatest Jedi Knights there is in George Lucas' trilogy prequels of the space opera. It is precisely these kinds of ""wink-wink"" opportunities that will put an enlightened audience clearly in the driver's seat to enjoy what else the film has to offer.<br/><br/>Starring opposite Ewan McGregor's reporter role Bob Wilton, is George Clooney's super psychic Lyn Cassady who once had worked under the super soldier programme, and had risen to the top, until his retirement from the force. Clooney is simply superb in the role of a man who takes the absurd very seriously, being on one hand what looks like a serious case of delusion, and yet on the other have enough proof displayed that there's really more than meets the eye to his so-called abilities. Seeing Clooney for the first time in shoulder length hair with that clueless, dogged determination, is already well worth the ticket price.<br/><br/>Other notables in its star studded cast includes Jeff Bridges as Bill Django, the unorthodox founder of the New Earth Army techniques, whose bewildering concept of the new super soldier got accepted by the Army, which begins that journey of laughter where actual training is nothing short of hilarious. Kevin Spacey takes on the conniving role as an envious new recruit to the programme, and in some ways, there are some local parallels to how father figures get ousted unceremoniously from their pedestal of power when a protégé decides to turn against the hand that had fed them. Spacey being Spacey, performs this role with aplomb.<br/><br/>There are enough random occurrences in the film that builds up the story and with each tells a little bit more about the characters, so while on one hand it's fun and laughter, on the other it calls for some patience as the characters wander through Iraq for Bob's search for his own destiny in life. What I had also enjoyed from the film is how it ties in with actual, reported attempts of non-lethal weapon research, and while I don't condone it, having to listen to Barney's theme song the whole day, is one cruel way to torture enemy combatants.<br/><br/>Be warned though that this may not be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're adamant about having a structured narrative from beginning to end, or feel that a running joke (the Star Wars ones that is) cannot be carried out for far too long."

","The Men Who Stare at Goats<br/><br/>Usually the men who stare at goats turn out to be the type of men who also sleep with goats.<br/><br/>However, in the case of this film, the men staring at goats are highly trained psychic soldiers in the New Earth Army.<br/><br/>Recently divorced journalist Bob (Ewan McGregor) decides to prove his worth by heading to Iraq. After arriving, he meets Lynn (George Clooney), a soldier who claims to possess paranormal abilities – given to him by the U.S. Army. Intrigued, Bob shadows Lynn, who reveals more about the secret unit as the two try to locate its hippy founder (Jeff Bridges), and overthrow its new leader (Kevin Spacey).<br/><br/>Based on varying anecdotes concerning the military's involvement in psychic warfare, TMWSAG is more a screwball comedy than a factual account.<br/><br/>As for identifying soldiers that may be clairvoyant, that information is protected under the U.S. Army's 'Don't ask, don't foretell' policy.

","Someone said that this film is modern Catch 22″. Although he had noble intentions, he is wrong – this film is better than the cult classic anti-war film! Sharp satire on the American military machine and aspirations, merciful angels, and similar ventures valuable historical oblivion.<br/><br/>Juan Mac Gregor, George Clooney, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey in a movie! A film about the secret in the American army detachment composed of various psycho-fools who call themselves Jedi"", and whose skill is the culmination of that view can kill a goat? The unit was formed in 80th years of the 20th century, in order to beat the Russians in paranormal research. After the hippie-captain was derogated, detachment was disbanded, until the present time and the war in Iraq. It is a story in which are thrown eager slave journalist, who had problems with his wife and her new lover – editors with an artificial hand.<br/><br/>Although, of course, has the more beautiful stories, such as those of the deadly stroke, which kills after 18 years, the attempt to achieve invisibility, levitates, the power of thought which could broke clouds, passing through walls, experience astral projection No goats, no glory"" is the motto of this film. It is a paraphrase of the military mantra (No guts, no glory – no balls, no glory).<br/><br/>Now we need the Jedi more than ever"", the final sentence of Juan Mac Gregor in the film. Just imagine that Who has not watched the film – hurry. Who does not believe the Jedi – hurry"

","I loved this film. I picked it from the list of what was on at our local cinema with almost no idea of what it was about, other than the description ""quirky comedy"", simply because I couldn't cope with a grim film that day, and I didn't want to see fluffy crap either. Turned out to be a great choice!<br/><br/>Has anyone else noticed just how very, very good an actor George Clooney is becoming? Even surrounded by other good actors giving great performances, George Clooney absolutely shines in this film. Clooney's Lyn Cassady is such a marvellous and fully-rounded creation that I found myself laughing at him, thinking him mad, thinking him sane, believing him, disbelieving him, and in the end, genuinely feeling for him - still not sure if he's entirely sane, but loving him anyway. George Clooney has been improving for years, but honestly, this performance is up there with the very best acting I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The film is a zesty romp that ranges from farce to buddy flick to moral lesson - all over the place - and holds it together perfectly. The moral compass of the film remains true throughout, without feeling heavy-handed. The pacing,for me, was exactly right - the narrative held together really well despite the frequent interjections of backstory. The structure and some of the more surreal passages reminded me of films like Being John Malkovich or Adaptation, but the performances by the leads in this film were so much more engaging that I felt a much greater emotional connection with the characters in this film than I have with characters in anything comparable I can think of.<br/><br/>This film was like one of those perfect novels that you simultaneously want to last forever, but can't wait to find out how it ends. Jeff Bridges gave an effortless but excellent performance as Bill Django,particularly in the latter parts of the film where he becomes less the remembered idol of Cassady and more the real man, with real history and issues of his own; and Ewan MacGregor as Bob Wilton gives a good performance too - a naive,likable journalist on a quest to win back his wife, ending up heading into Iraq and insane adventure with Cassady, ostensibly a waste contractor in search of a lucrative ""reconstruction"" work but in actuality a retired ""warrior monk"" with psychic powers. Kevin Spacey doesn't have much to work with but he's talented enough that he doesn't have to try hard to convince as Larry Hooper, the bad apple in the army's psychic barrel. <br/><br/>There was so much about this film to love, I could probably write an essay on it. Cinematography was fantastic, the soundtrack was fantastic, the script so full of laugh-out-loud funny that I ended up crying with laughter. And it's a smart movie too - there's a lot of ethical, social and political points being made here. They aren't hit-you-over-the-head Now Hear This kind of morals or politics, but they are there - and why not make us think while we're laughing? There were some moments toward the climax where things get genuinely poignant, and the emotional charge mostly comes from Clooney's superb performance. <br/><br/>Damn, I loved this movie. I got more enjoyment from it than from the last 10 movies I've seen combined. <br/><br/>I could have said much more about the plot, but heck, I knew nothing about it when I saw it and frankly, I think I enjoyed it more for that. Go see it. It's awesome."

","Before I went to see THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS I kind of had the feeling that this was one of those movies that gave away all the good stuff in the trailer. I certainly didn't expect this movie to be spectacular (it wasn't) or hilarious (it was). I mean it, I haven't been laughing so hard in the cinema for a long time. It's just a delight seeing world stars like George Clooney, Jeff Bridges or Kevin Spacey act those superpower-dorks. Yes, there may be some scenes where the story behind it is exaggerated but at those points, the movie always has the right gag in store, catching you off guard. And the climax is just a celebration of silliness, whereas the ultimate ending is nothing but pure satire.<br/><br/>Great cast, great script, interesting premise, wonderful jokes and overall just a barrel of laughs."

","'The Men Who Stare At Goats' directed by Grant Heslov is an excellent, hilarious film in all respects. Based on the book by the same title by author Jon Ronson, here comes a film that a Cine-Goer will truly love.<br/><br/>Now I have no idea of how much of these events are true, as shown in the film. I ""Audience"" just enjoyed. It has a funny plot of how psychic powers, might turn you into a Jedi. Some film are meant to be made, 'The Men Who Stare At Goats' is one those films. They're just there, weather you hate them or love. Well, as you must have understood till now that ""I"" am in love with this zany entertainer. Oh, if anything shown in this film was real... then hell ya, I should've been there! <br/><br/>The film promises laughter and delivers in abundance. The scenes between Bridges-Clooney are simply hilarious, and rank as the film's high-points. Even the climax, is very funny. Peter Straughan's adapted screenplay is witty and spot-on. Heslov's direction has it's touch. Robert Elswit's Camera-Work is also very good. <br/><br/>'The Men Who Stare At Goats' would've been half of the entertainer it is, if he hadn't had amazing performances. First of all it's a sheer pleasure to watch 4-Accomplished Actors come together in one film. Clooney is fantastic from start to end. McGregor is in top form, this is easily amongst his best works. Spacey is cool in a Grey role. Jeff Bridges is the best of them all, he's outstanding in each frame he appears in and it's a pleasure to watch the Academy Award Winner deliver such a performance. Stephen Lang is also terrific in a brief role. Others are satisfactory,<br/><br/>On the whole 'The Men Who Stare At Goats' rocks, it's exceptional work of Cinema. Over the years, I am sure this film will gain a strong Cult-Following. But as of now, A Two Big Thumbs Up from this Writer!"
"satish831","8","0","3","21 February 2010"," They really stare at goats
","I am writing my first review. Whenever i'm preparing to watch a movie, i will go through the review. some of the reviews are very useful, we can get a whole picture of the movie. <br/><br/>When i go through the title, i just thought it was just a title, but they really stare at goats. Clooney is looking very funny in the movie, the way he acted was excellent. besides jeff bridges also excellent. I really don't understand these type of things will actually happen or not. <br/><br/>Bill was an army officer who seen failure in the fellow soldiers. so he wants to bring a revolutionary army by preparing psychic powered soldiers. Lyn (clooney) is one of the students of bill, who believes he had some powers. and the rest of the story was how he used his powers, (not exactly powers.)"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","3","21 January 2010"," Not for everyone
","This movie will definitely be filed under the ""not for everyone"" tab and I can imagine people in the audience hurling obscenity as frequently as the protagonist, claiming waste of time and money. The most immediate thought association I have is Clooney's other movie ""The three kings"". But this one is more fun.<br/><br/>If I were to fit it into a genre niche, I'll put it between satire and farce. Purely technically, I suppose, you can call this sci-fi, as it is about a jilted husband, a journalist who, in a desperate attempt to restore his self esteemed, hurls himself into the heated mayhem of the Desert Wars to pursuit the story of a military project to develop ""psychic soldiers"". Among the assortment of mind-boggling targeted ""weapons"" is the ability to kill a goat by demolishing its heart through an intensive stare, hence the title.<br/><br/>The story-telling basically follow Ewan McGregor's first-hand narration as the reporter, rich with voice-overs, of his adventures alongside the eccentric (to use an extremely mild description) of George Clooney as the star soldier of the First Earth Battalion who keeps insisting that the former has been sent to join him on a special mission by some mysterious forces. Parallel to this narration is George Clooney's linear flashback of his distinguished career. Two other A-list, more-than-mere-cameo members of the cast are Kevin Spacey playing a very cool villain of sorts and smashing Jeff Bridges as the hippie army trainer of this special squad.<br/><br/>As mentioned, while there are some hilarious moments and pseudo-philosophical pitches, this movie is probably too nonsensical to win the heart of the general audience. If you've heard about the delicious in-jokes on other well-known movies, don't get your expectations too high as there are only just a couple."
"TumnusFalls","6","0","2","24 November 2009"," Not bad
","I was prepared not to like this. Coen Brother movies are so uneven - sometimes quite good, sometimes stinkers.<br/><br/>But this was good and funny. I laughed out loud about every 5 minutes at some inanity or foolish action.<br/><br/>Still, some of it was extremely weak.<br/><br/>**** SPOILER **** The movie starts in present day Ann Arbor - for no good reason. And nothing about the scene ""sets it"" in Ann Arbor. It could be Anytown, USA. So what was the point of that? The protagonist's wife falls for his boss. The boss has an artificial arm/hand. To what purpose? Not even a sight gag. Just there. This wasn't funny - just weird, and not weird in the sense of ""moving the plot along weird"" or ""makes the movie more interesting weird."" Just as if it were stuck in there for ""this should make people laugh weird."" Well, it didn't.<br/><br/>The Iraqi journalist Mahmoud gives the protagonist and his mentor his truck. This is not explained why. He just does. And they end up leaving the car in the desert. This is not explained why.<br/><br/>The goats in the desert are ""debleated."" This is not explained why, nor does it make sense in the plot, as the base is out in the middle of no where, unlike the first instance where the base was Ft. Bragg.<br/><br/>Letting criminals go free in the desert is no kindness. Based upon the previous scenes, there is nothing for hundreds of miles. And yet the prisoners walk out into the desert to their certain deaths. This is not explained why.<br/><br/>Giving soldiers on the FOB who have guns and who drive dangerous equipment LSD, in this movie, leads to no deaths or injuries. This is not explained why. I realize that this is a movie, but the soldiers who are stoned always manage to avoid the path of the various heavy equipment driving recklessly through the base and sometimes through buildings.<br/><br/>Too many weird things like this. Makes it not funny because I was constantly going, ""but even in the reality of this movie, this doesn't make sense."" So, a ""6"" - good, but not much better than average."
"andrastea","6","0","2","22 November 2009"," New Age meets the Army
","This time of the year seems to be for movies adapted from the books. The Men Who Stare at Goats is one of those. Again, actors Kevin Spacey, Ewan McGregor, George Clooney and Jeff Bridges do they best, but the story just does not carry. All the funny parts were obviously dumped into the trailer.<br/><br/>The story is based on reporter finding that USA army is training psychic spies, with all unbelievable elements included. The story has a lot potential and is an intriguing idea, something in the Clooney-McGregor chemistry worked out, and Bridges as an old timer hippie. As a style the film is fluctuating between the comedy and drama.<br/><br/>It is a nice movie for the afternoon, perhaps better as a DVD."
