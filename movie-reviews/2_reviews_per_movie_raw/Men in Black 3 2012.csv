","Men in Black 3 is fun, if flawed. Hugely better than 2, this stands as the better (if unnecessary) sequel to the original."

","It's been a decade since the last MIB film was released. We kind of missed the series even though Men In Black 2 wasn't really that good. In this sequel, it's pretty small and unnecessary but it still has the charms and bright imagination. Great Performances and Solid Visuals. It also has the same tone of the original Men In Black films. It's a wonderful action, adventure movie with non-stop enjoyment.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it does not follow the modern blockbuster roots and stay loyal to its own. By the way, this is a comical action film. It may not be a large one but what matters here is the fun characters. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones still got it but who shines here is Josh Brolin. He can perfectly imitate the facial expression and voice of Agent K and it's a lot better when he's around.<br/><br/>The plot sounds like a generic time traveling story, but there are imaginative and wonderful sequences in these. The humor is still clever. There is still a heart. The action is not quite appealing but the time jump scene was spectacular. A lot of people will be rooting for the design of the villain, Boris the Animal. At first glance, you might think it's creepy but you'll realize how awesome he actually looks.<br/><br/>Blockbusters like this are now obsolete. Our usual modern blockbusters are generic and bland cookie-cutters that are easy to be forgotten. This actually stays to its own kind. It's comical, it has life, it cares to the characters no matter how small and absurd the story is. Yes, it's small, but there are so many merits that are worth seeing. Either you're a fan of the series or not, you'll find it very enjoyable. The Men in Black series is still imaginative and fun."

","I am not exactly a Will Smith fan. I think the last Will Smith film I watched and liked was the first ""Men in Black"" film back in 1997. I was surprised to learn that there will be another installment of ""Men in Black"" this year, the third of the series. The second MiB was shown in 2002, and I did not even care to finish that one. Will the ten years between the last episode and this one make a difference? I needed to see that.<br/><br/>In this film, a vicious alien villain known as Boris the Animal escapes from his prison on the moon, where he had been locked up since being arrested by Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) back in 1969. One day, Agent K disappears from the present day. His partner Agent J (Will Smith) realizes that K had been assassinated by Boris forty years ago, which caused a major change of events, allowing Boris' alien race to overrun the Earth. J had to find a way to travel back in time to 1969 in order to save K and rectify the tragic consequences of his death. Can J save K and in turn save the Earth from the clutches of Boris?<br/><br/>The odd couple was just as they were before in the first films. Will Smith is still his old loudmouth Agent J as Tommy Lee Jones was his tight-lipped Agent K. As J goes back to the past, he will interact with the young 29-year old K, perfectly played by Josh Brolin. Brolin amazingly captures the laconic persona, and even the distinct voice, of Jones so well that they seemed to have been one and the same actor. It was also good to see Emma Thompson again in a major film as she portrayed Agent O, another senior agent with a soft spot for K. The younger Agent O was played by a cutie named Alice Eve, but she certainly did not convince us that she would look or act like Emma Thompson when she grows older.<br/><br/>I must say that this film was really a most entertaining one. Well, maybe more for me than for my kids. Younger audiences may find the jokes about 1969 cultural references, such as the hippies, the racial tension, etc., to be a bit difficult to grasp. But the fun action sequences with some exciting futuristic vehicles and weaponry, the imaginative and repulsive aliens made by no less than the master monster-maker Rick Baker, the thrilling integration of the historic Apollo 11 lift-off, and the touching revelation of K's big secret made this a very good and enjoyable movie to watch. 3D did not seem necessary. Director Barry Sonnenfeld got it right this time, and this segment certainly gave perfect closure to the story arc of the whole series."
"Faizan","7","144","189","20 May 2012"," A playful return to form....well, almost.
","A decade away from the movie scene has given the Men In Black series a chance at a fresher, newer perspective. Taking its cue from Shrek Forever After, MIB 3 takes on a tired concept (time travel in this case) if only to acknowledge the failure of its dull sequel and take us back to a different era allowing us to view the franchise from an unsullied angle. The result is a film that returns to its roots and gives audiences the chance to relive much of what they first enjoyed – a smart, sci-fi, buddy comedy that embraces everything weird and wonderful about the unknown universe.<br/><br/>In his first cinematic role in nearly 4 years, Will Smith's Agent J is the usual charming, witty wiseass we expect him to be. Still teamed up with the laconic Agent K (wrinkly Tommy Lee Jones) he is no closer to cracking his older partners deadpan demeanour but their relationship issues take a back seat when a nemesis from Kay's past, Boris the animal, turns up to exact revenge for having been imprisoned on the moon 40 years ago. His elaborate plan takes him back in the past, to the day he was caught, and sets ripples in the present, where K no longer exists and a different reality results. J has to then literally time jump (off the Empire State building no less) and fix the past for normalcy to return in the present.<br/><br/>Directly Barry Sonnenfeld seems to find his groove once again with the zany and icky shenanigans that put him on the map with the original. Using plenty of the wide angle camera work that gave him fame as the Coen's favourite lenser, the resulting imagery should work wonders for those who decide to pay extra and catch the film on 3D (converted). Boris the animal is also a return to series villains being screwball and menacing in equal measure (remember Vincent D'Onofrio?) and Rick Baker's excellent makeup effects are both incredible and revolting. The big surprise is how well Josh Brolin impersonates Jones in the role of a younger K – which should not be a surprise considering Brolin's recent, impressive body of work as a bonafide actor, most notably in W. So chameleon-like is his performance that you forget it's him and actually completely believe it's just a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones that you're seeing.<br/><br/>The films primary achievement and a true signal of its return to form though are the scenes set in the past. Not only is Josh Brolin a deadringer for Tommy Lee's K during his youth, but the hip musical vibes of the late 60's/early 70's allow for plenty of playfulness to ensue with a particularly hilarious segment devoted to Andy Warhol. If that isn't enough, everything very neatly ties into another epochal scientific moment from that time period and ends on a moment of curiously satisfying emotionality that provides not only closure to the film but the series as a whole. If that doesn't make you forgive all the wrongs that the sequel did and embrace this film as one of the years better movie franchise offerings the only thing that might work on you is a neuralizer."

","Once again our favorite MIB agents Jay & Kay are battling it out for earth. Quick action, colorful villains, beautifully designed settings and CGI, comic relief in the face of imminent destruction, all those made the first two movies great as well as successful in the box office. Could they better the formula in the face of all the other bad sequels we have been seeing for years? <br/><br/>This is one of the reasons I had stepped into the cinema with trepidation. (Good grief, was it 1997 when I saw the first and ten years ago the second? How time flies). The other reason was the pitfall of time travel.<br/><br/>Time travel is one of the favorite themes in sci fi movies but it needs to be handled carefully. My humble word of advice to the script writers: Keep-It-Simple. Avoid overtly complicated jumps back and forth and paradoxes that confuse the audience. Remember the eventual mess in the Back To The Future trilogy? I was then so pleased to see that they kept the time travel relatively simple and easy to follow. There was a small part when they crossed the line juuust a tiny bit when young agent Kay meets a certain father and son (don't want to spoil it). Even if traveling back in time was possible, you wouldn't necessarily bump into everyone you know in the present.<br/><br/>Will Smith is in his usual good form in his character Jay which however needs Kay to balance him. It is then fortunate that Brolin gives a great performance as the young agent.<br/><br/>Was it better than the 1997original? It was as good, without the novelty value obviously. Was it as good as the MIB2? I would say that it surpassed the second."

","It is really hard to believe that it has been 10 years since the last Men in Black film. I have to say that this film was much better than the last film which was really just a regurgitation of the first one. This film had a lot more substance and managed to tie up some loose ends which I really appreciated. I think that this film works in 3D because there is a lot of falling through time, which my niece and nephew loved. I have to give major props to Josh Brolin (younger Agent K) who had the daunting task of portraying an actor portraying a role. Tommy Lee Jones (old Agent K) just basically had to be himself (smile). Josh was totally convincing and did an excellent job imitating Tommy's persona. I liked the introduction of Agent O (Emma Thompson) who had one of the funniest scenes in the film and literally had me laughing out loud. I also liked the fact that a women was in charge of such a prestigious agency. As usual Will Smith (Agent J) came up with very comical explanations of the weird situations that occur during the film. I think that my favorite character in the film is Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg). He was a psychic who could see into the various futures that could occur if certain things happen. I was a little confused at first, but as the film progressed, I finally got it. I related to this character because I have always believed that you always have at least two doors to open (e.g. you can pick up that piece of paper or not) and whatever you decide to do affects everything else. Okay, enough of philosophy class and back to the film. The one thing about all the Men in Black films is all of the different characters that the visual effect crew create. You have to appreciate the imagination of those folks. I also like to check out the aliens that they are monitoring at the agency, for example in the first one they were monitoring Michael Jackson and Agent J's elementary school teacher. Appropriately in this film you get flashes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber (appropriately). I wonder if they have to agree to that? Anyway, this was a very entertaining film and you will be glad that you saw it in 3D. I give this film an out-of-this-world green light. Enjoy!!!"

","Well, whaddaya know, the ""MiB"" have gone MiA for 10 years already! No wonder many of us have forgotten about them as Men In Cape and Bodysuits (aka The Avengers, Batman, Spider-Man, et al) have been hogging the cinemas while the ""Men In Black"" go missing-in-action. No matter, they are still a barrel of fun in this three-quel that comes as more of a surprise than a treat that we have been waiting for.<br/><br/>And with Barry Sonnenfeld back at the helm of this troubled and delayed US$215-million production, it is a nostalgic film in more ways than one.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as agents J and K of the secret Men in Black organization that monitors alien activity on Earth. The 'odd-couple' have their work cut out for them when extra-terrestrial serial killer Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from his maximum security prison on the moon and travels back in time to kill K. Since only J remembers K's existence, it's up to him to venture through time, look for a young K (now played by Josh Brolin) and stop Boris from destroying the world once and for all.<br/><br/>I have never been a fan of time-travel plots and I still don't like them. However, the time-travel subplot here is just to provide the ""Back To The Future"" fantasy to the MiB franchise. The narrative, as well as the mood and tone of the movie, are light-hearted, fun and always on the outer limits of credibility. Again, it is nice to see how a deadpan face like Jones' can generate so much mirth. The Smith & Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of how K would be in the Sixties, with most of the sequences accompanied by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>One of the staple jokes of the MiB series is the celebrity cameos that suggest alien origins. In MiB3, we have a 'twist' that suggests a certain pop art personality is an undercover MiB agent! Still, the mainstay of the MiB series is Rick Baker's creature designs and make-up rendered in 3D. The 'monster show' does not disappoint, especially that of a huge fish that attacks diners at a Chinese restaurant. Oh yes, there are also a couple of cool gadgets and vehicles like the giant wheel hoover-bikes used by Agents J and K. On the whole, Agents J and K still provide the 'L'. - limchangmoh.blogspot.com"

","This film is about Agent J going back in time to rescue Agent K from being murdered by aliens.<br/><br/>My friends say that ""Men in Black III"" is a brainless comedy, you can go in just for a few laughs and switch your brain off. After watching it, I can safely say that I have another opinion.<br/><br/>""Men in Black III"" does have its brainless moments. It can be politically incorrect too, but it is entertaining and fun to watch. Special effects are realistic, and the scene involving a very tall building made me so nervous that my palms perspired a lot! The ending is very touching; I certainly did not see it coming even though a friend guessed it.<br/><br/>I think it is great that ""Men in Black III"" manages to combine emotional elements in the middle of mainstream blockbuster entertainment. I look forward to the next film in the series already."

","I have been a fan of the Men in Black movies since the original released in 1997. When MIB-II was finally out in 2002, I wondered why it took so long as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith seemed to work so well together, and their characters had that just right mix of complementing but contradicting personalities.<br/><br/>Jones has long been a favorite of mine with some other highlight performances being the delightfully crazy villain in Under Siege (1992) and the hard nosed cop in The Fugitive (1993) and U.S. Marshalls (1998). His ability to make a facial expression the equivalent of the picture's 1000 words imho is up there with Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>Smith has distinguished himself in action, comedy, and drama films alike. He is a quite versatile actor whose movies I will gladly check out just because he is starring.<br/><br/>With MIB 3 coming another 10 years after MIB II, I once again wonder what took so long. While Jones's part as ""K"" is not so prominent as in the prior releases, he does well as the present day character. Smith follows the formula as ""J"" although the interaction with old ""K"" is a tad forced.<br/><br/>The pleasant realization is that Josh Brolin performs admirably as the past, younger ""K."" Brolin is certainly a fine actor in his own right, but his effective portrayal of Jones' character is nothing short of remarkable. The key to the plot is that Brolin is ""K"" before whatever happened that turned ""K"" into such a detached curmudgeon.<br/><br/>Also juicy was the villain's part done by Jermaine Clement as Boris (the animal).<br/><br/>Besides all the action and suspense you expect with the good guys vs. bad guy alien stuff, and the touches of comedy here and there to break it up, there is a dramatic and quite poignant and touching twist that comes out of nowhere that answers why ""K"" appears to be such an unemotional person, and why ""K"" has such regard for ""J."" Top quality actors and performances, well done script, yeah, this one's a keeper."

","Although MIB3 wasn't necessarily a 'bad' movie, it certainly wasn't as good as it could have been. It seemed, while watching the marketing plugs, like they were going to bring the big guns and bring back all the funny stuff and cool special effects, but they just fell short. The original was quite good -- Funny, a little scary, cool characters, good stunts, very original. Part II was just bad. So, if you are going to wait 10 years to do a three-quel that nobody really was dying to see because part 2 was so bad, then you better make part 3 REALLY good -- Right? <br/><br/>Well -- It wasn't REALLY good. It was OK. I wanted to love it, but I honestly only barely liked it. It was lacking the things that made the franchise 'cool.' There was no talking pug, no funny pawn shop guy, no real interesting or funny aliens at all. The lead bad-guy alien was a somewhat interesting character, but no real personality. Nothing that made you want more of him. And other than him, there was hardly any other aliens in it. One little stint in a Chinese restaurant, but nothing rememorable. No funny ones. I just don't understand not making more characters like the ones that made the first such a hit. And even Wil Smith wasn't funny. He was funnier during his promotions on talk shows than in his movie. He just seemed to walk through the whole thing.<br/><br/>ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to see it in 3D. None.<br/><br/>I hate to say it -- But the special effects were awful. With technology today, most special effects are seamless. As an audience, we now 'expect' good effects. Half the time, it was very obvious when they were using backdrops and green screens and had super-imposed stuff. That's just a deal-breaker in today's movie-going world. <br/><br/>The one truly redeeming quality it had -- and it was good -- was Josh Brolin playing the younger K (Tommy Lee Jones). He was spot on and did a great job. But even that isn't enough to carry a movie that wants to be a summer Blockbuster.<br/><br/>Bottome Line -- Rent it. It's worth seeing if you have it lying around the house and have nothing to do, but not if you have to pay full price, and nothing you have to run right out and see.<br/><br/>And this is from a fan of Wil Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin."

","Interesting enough as time travel with aliens movie but not really enough good ideas and does not contain much novel material. What a film that is supposed to be about CGI spectacle and strange aliens has to be fancy ar**ed about sixties cultural references - lord only knows. The plot revolves around 'The Terminator', eg Will Smith has to go back in time to prevent the Tommy Lee Jones characte being killed by his arch nemesis Boris, who has escaped top security jail on the Moon! The Boris character is not played by Tim Curry but nevertheless is way over the top but not truly original or menacing enough. Most of it is a conventional 'Let's save the Earth from a Napoleon-complex mega baddie.' And it is terribly thin on spectacle as it arcs its way to the final showdown at Cape Canaveral. Good jokes for adults and an excellent lookalike and soundalike performance by Josh Brolin as the young Tommy Lee Jones, but film wastes 3D - and the price at the Odeon Putney was a total rip off - £10!!!!!! Not good enough by half."
"DICK STEEL","8","55","101","21 May 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Men In Black III
","It was 1997 when Men in Black first burst onto the big screen featuring a successful pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as unlikely partners in the protection of Earth against the scum of the universe, with action, special effects and generous doses of comedy rolled into one. Directed by Barry Sonnenfield, they returned five years later for a sequel, and chances for a third film got hovered around for the longest time, finally taking up to a decade before it materialized, taking advantage of the needless 3D format to deliver the latest installment of the popular series.<br/><br/>And it's still a lot of fun with the return of Agent Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) in a new adventure set around the break out of the villainous alien Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) from a lunar maximum prison to take revenge on Kay for the severing of an arm and its imprisonment, not to mention also wiping out its compatriots and protecting the Earth from annihilation. Yes, Kay is credited for plenty of work done back in his heydays of the 60s, and we're about to find out a lot more about his deadpan character, which is almost always the punching bag for Jay, who makes it his mission to reverse what Boris had set out to do, which is to travel back in time and taking out Kay.<br/><br/>It's MIB meets Back to the Future with its time travelling element back to the 60s, armed with only limited knowledge of his partner's whereabouts, no thanks to information being classified over and above Jay's pay grade, despite 14 years of dedicated service. The story by Ethan Cohen, David Koepp, Jeff Nathanson and Michael Soccio proved to be a winner, steering clear of having too many cooks with potential of spoiling the broth, making that time travel bit pretty much a trip down nostalgic lane, filled with incidents and prominent characters from history, such as Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) and the Apollo 11 crew, and the tongue in cheek treatment with aliens being very much leaping from typical 60s television and films.<br/><br/>This makes up more than its share of laughs and inside jokes that continue in the same spirit from the earlier films, even poking fun at the racial divide of the time, which provided a fair challenge for Jay as he meets up with the younger Kay (Josh Brolin) who has to be convinced that his new found friend is his partner from the future, and have to work together to rein in the 1969 version of Boris the Animal. Tommy Lee Jones made way for Josh Brolin to own the character of Jay, and in truth Brolin does a remarkable job of closely mimicking Jones, aptly adding a lot more to the back story of the legendary MIB who has his fair share of one liners, but being a little bit less stern than Jay had grown accustomed to.<br/><br/>Characterization also got pushed to the forefront with a deeper exploration into each of Jay and Kay's characters, backgrounds and their friendship, and this helped the film tremendously, instead of being a mediocre effort relying solely on the actors charisma and washing everything down in CG glory. There are still some surprises from the effects kept under wraps from the trailers, so that's a good thing, and I suppose much of the graphics work went into recreating 60s USA, as well as earlier, more cumbersome versions of tools of the trade that MIB uses back then. Alien designs also got a spruce up, looking far more menacing, and disgusting even, with Boris the Animal possessing and using deadly force that I'm rather surprised at for a PG rated film.<br/><br/>Will Smith shows that he hasn't lost his edge and still has what it takes, even after being absent from the big screen for some 4 years now (Seven Pounds and Hancock were his last outing in 2008), and still comes off as a natural, and likable as Agent Jay, with a lot more polish as an MIB veteran as compared to when he got first recruited. Tommy Lee Jones got only a supporting role this time round, with Josh Brolin left responsible to carry the role of the younger K for the most parts of the film. The Smith-Brolin pairing was also a winner, though likely to be one off only for this movie, but you can guess how any sequel made after this could go - either to continue with Smith-Jones in the current timeline, or having Brolin helm his own, partnering another Agent in adventures set in the past. And joining the cast in prominent, though limited roles, include the likes of Emma Thompson as Agent O, taking over as the new MIB Chief with the passing of Zed, Alice Eve playing the younger O, and both Michael Stuhlbarg and Mike Colter adding depth to the MIB mythos.<br/><br/>Still, with every time travel movie, there are paradoxes that have to be consciously ignored for everything to work. While some aspects work in having being explained away, others necessary and crucial to the plot become glaringly obvious, especially in the finale where it showed some shades of similarity from A Chinese Odyssey. But all is forgiven for something canonical to be added to the adventures of the MIB, providing audiences with new appreciation for the leading MIBs Jay and Kay, rather than to rely on louder and bigger explosions for the sake of keeping up with the summer Joneses. MIB3 is a clear winner, and worthy of what the previous two films had already set up. Highly recommended!"
"MangoUno","7","31","56","26 May 2012"," It's not perfect, but Men in Black III is a fun return for the series.
","In 1997, the first Men in Black came out. It was something no one had ever seen before: a sci-fi movie crossed with the buddy comedy and action genres? To this day it remains one of my personal favorite movies. However, I was disappointed with its sequel, Men in Black II. The film felt like a almost a carbon copy of the original. Ten years later, we have Men in Black III. It's quite a surprise to see this franchise after it was pretty much left for dead. But is it any good? Yes it is. Men in Black III is a fun movie, a cool and nostalgic trip down memory lane. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it's still a blast.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 2012, 10 years after the second movie. Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) are still partners, working for the Men in Black, a secret government organization which monitors all alien life on Earth. But one day, J goes to work and finds out that K was assassinated in 1969. J must then go back in time and team up with a young Agent K (Josh Brolin) to fix the future and stop an alien invasion.<br/><br/>The cast is rock solid as always. Will Smith looks like he's having a blast as the cool, wise ass Agent J. Tommy Lee Jones plays Agent K, the expressionless, relaxed veteran. Jermaine Clement plays the films villain, the vicious Boris the Animal, and Emma Thompson is just alright as the new leader of the MiB, Agent O. But the real star of the show is Josh Brolin as a young Agent K. The whole movie you forget he's just an actor and believe he's really a 29-year-old K. His performance is very believable and well done.<br/><br/>The special effects and makeup, some of the most praised parts of the MiB series, are very good. Danny Elfman's score is also top-notch, sounding very Men-in-Blacky (Is that even a word?). The set pieces too are very cool. You feel like you are in 1969, with not only New York City, but also a scene later in the film with the Apollo 11 mission taking off.<br/><br/>However, the flaws of the film are in the script. The screenplay is very funny, and is well written, for the most part. The problems lie within the plot holes and goof-ups. The relationship between Agent K and O could have been fleshed out more. I was left unsatisfied with that plot line. For the goof-ups, there's one instance where J is talking to Young K, and he mentions ""Jedi Knight Mind Tricks"". K then looks like he knows exactly what he is talking about. That part of the film takes place in 1969. Star Wars came out in 1977. Whoops.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film was that it was just too long. At some points during the film I was a little bit bored. They probably could have shaved off about 10-15 minutes of the film and it would be fine.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Men in Black III is a surprisingly fun movie. It's very funny, very well acted, and very cool. Unfortunately the script and longer running time prevent it from being a classic like the first movie. Still, if you just want some great fun at the movies, definitely give MiB3 a go."

","The MIB duo of Agent Jay (Will Smith) and Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) are back in action. When the world is threatened by an evil alien, Agent Jay travels back in time to 1969, where he teams up with the younger Agent Kay to stop an evil villain named Boris (Jemaine Clement) from destroying the world in the future. Emma Thompson will play take-charge MIB operative Agent Oh, who is monitoring a prison breakout.<br/><br/>The first of the Men In Black franchise was a great movie. It was highly successful and from that spawned a Men In Black dance, a no. 1 hit single from the soundtrack, loads of toys and a cartoon series. The second film was awful; truly awful; beyond terrible and instantly forgettable. This latest instalment is somewhere between the 1st and the 2nd film. To be honest, it wasn't great at all! Let me get straight into it this.<br/><br/>Performances, apart from one, measure up from terrible to very good. Smith reprises his role as Agent J and is as funny and charismatic as he's always been. Tommy Lee Jones has a small part to play in this, but he's an actor who can say one line throughout an entire film and still show more presence than most of the cast members. Emma Thompson throws in her 10 pence worth and does OK, but it's Josh Brolin who is very good playing the younger version of Agent K. Most people will agree that Brolin is a highly rated actor who has played a myriad of characters in his career. An almost uncanny performance from Brolin as well as the talented Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man) who plays alien Griffin are the standouts in this film. Everyone else does what they're supposed to do and they are where they're meant to be I suppose.<br/><br/>Set pieces are boring and nothing special. The actual story itself isn't that bad, but the whole thing feels rushed. The main villain Boris The Animal played by Jermaine Clement from Flight of the Concords fame, belongs in the category of one of the worst villains ever to grace the screen. Just rubbish – nothing special about that him at all. I think only Lara Flynn Boyle in the second movie faired better, with Vincent D'Onofrio being the best of a bad bunch. Actually D'Onofrio was awesome in the first film.<br/><br/>I think I fell asleep for about five minutes or five seconds. I don't know, Men In Black 3 is just average. It didn't grab me like the first film did and I was really hoping that this would. There's nothing else to say, but just don't make a 4th film Mr Sonnefield.

","I giggled a few times. i think I wanted to giggle. I liked MIB. i liked the music, I liked the wit, the style, the fun premise that had always been there as an undercurrent in serious conspiracy films and nutty urban legends but never fully explored. i liked the hard drinking alien worms, the little witty twists- universes inside universes, the common sense street-cop who wins out against educated morons. <br/><br/>It seems after the original they got stuck. They seemed to run out of things to say, so simply rehashed the old- the talking pug, universes inside train stations, regrowing alien heads and a storyline stolen from Jewel in the Nile. <br/><br/>Here, in the third instalment, they ditched some of the more familiar supporting characters and while I might have applauded that since they already seemed old in the second instalment, they failed to replace them. We still have aliens and their ever-resilient heads in there, but there was a genuine attempt to move things to a fresher place. The time travel storyline should have been brilliant- this was when space/alien mania took off, the birthplace of nutty conspiracy theories combined with swinging sixties free loving, trippy hippy, bring your own bong culture, Get Smart gadgets and a man trying to save the world while being black! It was ripe...and it stank. <br/><br/>Okay bad pun but this film deserves it. It's like you can see the chalk marks where they have started to draw in the plot, you can see where they're going, see them circling the joke, but the finished product is just not finished, it should still be sitting on the drawing board in this state. Will Smith appears to be free-winging it in the hope that eventually he'll brainstorm his way to the punchline- he doesn't get there but we do get to enjoy his working process.Jones plays a man who seems to have reached the end and is willing to embrace it....need I put in the obvious line?<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into obvious plot spoilers, there are plot holes, always are with time travel, its really not an issue except when you end up sitting there thinking eh? You do a little here, but I think in many ways that is because the storyline is too simple. It makes no real attempt to address (or in the style of MIB, exploit and poke fun at), the inherent issues, such as the grandfather paradox, that inevitably come up with time travel, so that you feel as though you must have missed something.<br/><br/>That in the end is what ruins this film. They have tried so hard to avoid the obvious, the cliché, the previous tricks of the franchise that they have left themselves with nothing but holes. The beauty of MIB was not that it avoided clichés but how it played with them, tweaking our expectations in tiny, but deliciously original ways. Without them we are simply left without."

We paid $8.25 and saw it in 2D; just fine.<br/><br/>Old timers can remember when we watched a comedy there were many people laughing. Sweet memory! This time there were maybe two knee-slap laughs. There was no significant laughter going on at our showing.<br/><br/>They ought to have spent $200 or so on a historian. I was OK with the fish monster and some of the other sight gags, but Will Smith could not have stolen the Cadillac from in front of the Roosevelt Hotel in 1969 because that property was closed and boarded up. Few tourists in NYC due to extreme crime problems. Similarly, they show us normal ""family crowd"" folks enjoying Coney Island. Not in 1969, folks! As New York was sinking in a cess pool of drugs, violent crime, corruption and losing 20% of its population, visit Coney Island with two large friends for a hot dog at Nathan's; walk in any direction past blocks and blocks of boarded up abandoned houses, many with the boards ripped off by the heroin addicted squatters. Families being happy? No way! Today, sure; not in 1969, not 5 years prior or 10 years after. The story need not have been in NYC, but if so they ought not paint a false picture of it."

","Well it's been 10 years since the dismal MIB2 where Johnny Knoxville at the height of his Jackass fame was miscast as an obscure evil sidekick, so 3 is at the very least an improvement. However, the 3D is not worthy, while other than a few decent gags from the fast talking Will Smith, it's Josh Brolin who steals every scene he appears in as the young Agent K. Sending Agent J back to the swinging 1960's New York was cool, especially in a clever Andy Warhol moment and a few observational one-liners The non-event plot as it turns out could have been extended more and gets plain ridiculous at a NASA launch, but there is a nice emotional touch at the end, but too little too late. Certain scenes are expertly choreographed, effects are mostly cool, the bad guy here (both versions) is a waste of time and boring. Overall MIB3D works as popcorn entertainment for kids."
"Troy_Campbell","5","12","22","1 June 2012"," Brolin is amazing. The film is not.
","Let's just get this out of the way: Josh Brolin's portrayal of a young Tommy Lee Jones is freakishly good. It's one of the most amusing performances of 2012 so far. It's disappointing then that the film around him – which appears to have felt the effects of its well known production issues – is hit and miss at best, cringe-worthy at worst. The CGI is often horrible, Jemaine Clement's villain is underwhelming and Hollywood stalwarts Jones and Emma Thomson are criminally underused. However, there's still enough here to recommend for Dad's and sons looking for some female-free time. Will Smith is clearly relishing the opportunity to play Agent J for the third time and he slots back into ultra-cool, jive-talking mode like a second skin. A handful of the gags work too, most of them stemming from the fish-out-of-water premise having Agent J return to the sixties. Oh, and did I mention that Brolin is amazing? He's almost worth the price of admission alone. Almost."

There are a few laughs here and there although the movie goes through about 1 hour with nothing happening. It is just people talking here and there.<br/><br/>Even the special effects are very minimal and somewhat B-Grade at times. The lines in this movie are awful. Huge disappointment for me.

","The first ""Men in Black"" film arrived roughly fifteen years ago and pleased audiences. Five years later, the second installment of the franchise arrived and left many moviegoers disappointed. Then, the Men in Black went missing for ten years and now roughly a decade after the previous installment arrived, ""Men in Black 3"" arrives in theaters with a time-traveling storyline and we finally get to see our beloved Agent J and Agent K again.<br/><br/>The arrival of ""Men in Black 3"" last Friday marks an event of comebacks. Obviously, the film marks the return of the ""Men in Black"" franchise which has gone dormant for roughly a decade. But the arrival of this film also marks the return of Will Smith to the big screen. His last major role was in 2008's ""Seven Pounds"" and he has gone into a three-and-a-half year absence since then. Now he returns to the big screen as one of his most popular roles. He is undoubtedly one of the biggest stars on the planet and seeing him return to the big screen is welcoming.<br/><br/>Ten years separated this installment and ""Men in Black 2"", where as fifteen years separated ""Men in Black 3"" and the original one. Due to the large gap in time between the movies, the concept of Men in Black might be new to some people. Basically, it's about an organization that deals with paranormal and extraterrestrial activity on Earth. You can say that these people are the policemen for aliens.<br/><br/>So what's this third installment about? Intergalactic extraterrestrial criminal Boris (Don't call him Boris the Animal or ... you'll see) has escaped a super-max prison located on the Moon. He arrives on Earth to deal with some unfinished and personal business with Agent K. Apparently back in 1969, Agent K cut off Boris's left arm during a confrontation. Now Boris wants revenge and so travels back into 1969 to kill the younger K to prevent the 2012 K from existing. Agent J also travels back in time to prevent his partner from being slain by the extraterrestrial convict.<br/><br/>1969 is different from 2012. Unfortunately, 1969 is a time where there is still discrimination to black people, much to Agent J's dismay. Even though it's 1969 and their Neuralyzer isn't as advanced as the 2012 version, they still have some rad technology, especially the single-wheeled bikes used by the two Agents. But what steals the show is the appearance of Josh Brolin as the younger Agent K. Due to the plot, Tommy Lee Jones had to give out most of his role to Josh Brolin for most of the movie.<br/><br/>""Men in Black 3"" also offers some interesting twists. Aside from the young Agent K, we also discover some shocking revelations. For example, we now know that famous photographer Andy Warhol is an undercover Man in Black under the name of Agent W. We also learn that there is some chemistry between Agent K and Agent O that dates back to 1969. At the end of the climax, we also discover an important moment about Agent J's early life.<br/><br/>""Men in Black 3"" is a very entertaining film. It includes solid action sequences against extraterrestrials of bizarre natures. The action sequences are very entertaining and keep the film suspenseful. The climax of the film delivers and does not disappoint. The aliens were also very imaginative, creative and very detailed.<br/><br/>Not only does ""Men in Black 3"" excel in the action scenes, but the cast here delivered powerful performances. Will Smith who had been missing-in-action for three-and-a-half years proved that his star power has not diminished over these years as he delivered a solid, charismatic, and powerful performance. Although he had to relinquish most of his role to Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones also delivered an excellent performance as our beloved Agent K. But the guy who elevated the film's excellence is Josh Brolin. His performance as the young Agent K is compelling and spellbinding and all around impressive. The other supporting cast also did amazing performances.<br/><br/>The humor here is also heart-warming. Most of the humor comes from the man himself, Will Smith. When there is a depressing scene, there's always some humor to help alleviate the sadness.<br/><br/>""Men in Black 3"" as a whole is an impressive and entertaining film. It has an interesting premise, action scenes that build up suspense, solid performances, and outstanding visual effects. ""Men in Black 3"" is highly recommended, for both fans of the previous two installments, and those new to the concept. While this installment may not surpass the first one in terms of quality, it's a drastic improvement from the disappointing second installment.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""Men in Black 3"" is an excellent addition to the ""Men in Black"" franchise that includes an interesting plot line and solid performances, especially Josh Brolin, that is a major improvement to the second installment."

It's too bad to since it has good actors in it: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Emma Thompson and Josh Brolin. Speaking of Josh Brolin, he practically steals the whole movie from both Jones and Smith. His young agent K is one of the movie's highlights. The villain, Boris the animal is also a bright spot. What wasn't so bright was the humor. The jokes just weren't punching and no one in the audience was laughing. That's bad for a movie like this. The aliens were so so. The best in fact was the one who looked most human, Griffen. The special effects were all things we'd seen before and the time travel stuff also wasn't that innovative. Incorporating a certain historical event could also have been done better and it seems that in 1969 people weren't really very observant cause I might have noticed a few things and they didn't neuralize everyone who should have seen things."

","The Man in Men in Black 3 should've gone back in time to erase Part II, instead.<br/><br/>For this third MIB film, this absolute make-up movie, à la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, was the sequel the second one should've been. Mercifully, it did make-believe the second chapter didn't exist and only spoke of events in the original.<br/><br/>Was this movie really necessary? Actually, I'm not the one asking that – I've heard that question multiple of times leading up to the release, but I will be the one answering. 90% yes and 10% probably. No is not the answer.<br/><br/>While not perfect as it certainly had script and direction problems and though most of the jokes worked, there were a half of dozen scenes of un-fun silliness and overkill that made it tad cloudy. That said, it was a lot more fun than not and again, if this is the final one, it was a nice closureway more than that joke of a movie the middle segment was.<br/><br/>And besides all that, I had a good time. The finale was enjoyable – although it really channeled (2006) Casino Royale's opening and the action was present and from the one cast member I wanted it the most from: Tommy Lee Jones. Obviously, it's not really him and that's apparent in most the movie considering it was Young K (Josh Brolin.) Oh, and by the way, he was not just spot-on, I never, ever thought that was anyone but a young Jones.<br/><br/>The movie's opening 10 or so minutes were apparently more successful than all of previously released Lockout, and this leads a bad alien to go back in time to kill Men in Black agent K and in turn, agent/partner J back, as well, to save him. And, the world, of course.<br/><br/>That's the best and easiest synopsis I can give, and of course, there's more to the story, but its best you just sit back and let the men entertain you.<br/><br/>I don't want to give this my highest praise – it's doubtful this will land anywhere near my 2012 top ten list, but it's fun companion the first one. Nowhere as close to freshness or quality, but, again, like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it's a fun ride that should be seen following part one.<br/><br/>(Notice how I didn't include part two in that statement. Neither should anyone else.)"

","The original MEN IN BLACK was awesome. I remember watching it and hoping it became a continuing franchise. Then MEN IN BLACK II came out and I took it all back. What a bomb. I can't say I was all that disappointed when it looked like the second movie might've killed the franchise. If that was the sort of movies they were going to put out, let the franchise die before it got any worse. Surprised doesn't even begin to describe my reaction when I found out they were making a third movie. It had been ten years since the second movie. It seemed a little late to go diving back into that well, but whatever. Ten years should be enough time to get a story right. I guess it wasn't though, because I'd read that the script wasn't even complete when they started shooting MEN IN BLACK 3. It wasn't a good sign. I guess there were a lot of problems during production, so I didn't get my hopes up. Regardless, I was hoping this movie might reinvigorate the series. The third film returns to Agents J and K doing their MiB routine. When K fails to show any form of emotion at Agent Zed's funeral, J begins to question just what happened to turn K into the cold man his is now. He'll get his chance when a criminal from K's past, Boris the Animal, breaks out of prison and travels to 1969 to kill K and negate Earth's orbital protection system. To save K's life and prevent an Earth invasion, J must travel back in time to save the future.<br/><br/>I'm hesitant to label MEN IN BLACK 3 a total disappointment because there are some really good elements to it. I loved the time travel element, and 1969 was a great time to incorporate. The birth of America's space exploration and a time ripe with it's own brand of cheesy sci-fi movies. When J arrives in MiB HQ in 1969, all of the flashy, sleek aliens we're accustomed to are gone and replaced with rubber suits and glass bowl helmets. It was a great touch. I loved the early versions of popular MiB gear (e.g. K's corded neurolyzer with it's dial-up modem connection), and Bill Hader's got a great cameo as Andy Warhol. I wish more had been done with the 1969 environment but I guess the filmmakers could only fit so much into the movie while keeping the plot on track. Josh Brolin was a perfect choice as a young Tommy Lee Jones/Agent K. He totally nails every little nuance of Jones's character, adding some new life of his own. This movie wouldn't have worked half as well without Brolin's performance. The first half of MEN IN BLACK 3 was a lot of fun and hearkened back to the best elements of the first movie. I was ready and willing to forget the misstep that was MEN IN BLACK II. For the most part, I would call MEN IN BLACK 3 a surprising success but it wasn't perfect.<br/><br/>The second half of the move starts to drag, right about the time a fifth-dimensional alien named Griffin arrives in the movie. The character isn't so much a drag; in fact, I thought he was a pretty unique creation for the movie and done well with a performance by Michael Stuhlbarg. It's just that his arrival signifies the start of the less exciting, more emotional parts of the movie. If I'm watching one of these movies, I want crazy sci-fi action and bizarre aliens with end-of-the-world intentions. I don't watch them for an emotional core. It slows down the fun. I can get drama from other movies. There's a big element in this movie about the relationship between J and K and it dominates the second half of the film. Then there's Boris the Animal. He's not a bad villain. He's not on the level of Serleena and her Johnny Knoxville henchman of the second movie, but he's nowhere near as cool or threatening as Edgar the bug. I think Jermaine Clement is a funny dude. He was the best part of DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS. But his Boris is just a snarling, over-loud mess. He's roars most of his lines and fires bone quills from his hands. Not bad, but there's been better alien baddies. With a little more effort into the script, this might've been as good as the first but, even with its flaws, it turned out surprisingly well. It's got me interested again in the chance of continuing the franchise."

","I'm giving Men in Black a 4 due to the fact that it was so predictable and similar to the first 2 movies. Familiarity is important for most entertainment media however similarity breeds boredom. They also lost the comedic edge the first 2 movies had. The first 2 movies had some surprises in the scenes and imaginative characters wherein this one didn't really shock you or surprise you in any of the sets or the designs of any aliens. There was an unexpected thing that happened also. This movie was obviously shot in 3d. Which meant that some of the scenes were blurry as they were changed into 2d. It was also painstakingly obvious that it was shot in high def and digital because you could see the makeup lines and the dye job on Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. <br/><br/>Was it good clean fun ? Yup. <br/><br/>They channeled the autistic guy from Fringe too hard w/ the Time Traveler though & his wardrobe was over done..... <br/><br/>I think Hollywood is going to have to re-think some things: like, allowing people to look naturally beautiful. The days of using make-up to accentuate features that get washed out because of stage lighting are gone. We can see everything now. Like eye contacts circles.

With all the good movies out there I was disappointed that I wasted my money on this one. Not even a good movie rental. They relied too much on their old jokes and didn't really offer anything new.

Will Smith is the same old wisecracking fool but lately I feel Will Smith is not enjoying acting. A lot of his movies rely on that wisecracking youngster but he's just not that guy anymore. Will Smith is a different person and you can see he tries his best to get into the ""Hell No"" thang but his heart is just not in it and it rings hollow. The best actors were Griff and 1960's Agent K. <br/><br/>The general idea is good. Go back in time to save the day. The goofy looking aliens are still there but it doesn't work. The action scenes don't add up, there is no drama or tension at any point and the humour is hollow. And really there is only a single gadget.<br/><br/>The charm of the MIB 1 was the fish out of water element. The surly Agent K and the continuously amazed Agent J playing off each other in a kind of buddy movie. In this kind of movie you need to see someone experiencing the magic for the first time and you need to have two good buddies. <br/><br/>As it stands it's not bad.

"gregeichelberger","5","12","25","22 May 2012"," Back to the future for a third MIB installment
","The cheeky, irreverent humor blended with the extra-stellar sci-fi, along with the oil-and-water mixture of a bland, laid-back Tommy Lee Jones and a wisecracking, frenetic Will Smith, made 1997's ""Men In Black"" an original and humorous introduction to the newly-minted genre - the alien invasion comedy.<br/><br/>Like most popular movies, however, a sequel appeared (in 2002) starring an unfunny and over-the-top Johnny Knoxville as a villain, which seemed to knock the franchise out of orbit.<br/><br/>Now, though, a slight re-invention of the plot has given a fresh shot of energy and cleverness to the series. Of course, this is mostly due to the time-travel storyline, as well as the inclusion of Josh Brolin (""W,"" ""No Country For Old Men,"" an Academy Award nominee for ""Milk""). The picture also wisely avoids ANY connection with part two.<br/><br/>And while many of Smith's streetwise jokes fall flat (and he's too old now to pull off a reasonable fast-talking, jive-ass), plus, the 3D technology is completely unnecessary, ""Men In Black 3"" is nevertheless a welcome addition to the franchise, for the small amount that praise is worth.<br/><br/>Agent J (Smith) is constantly riding his partner, Agent K (a well-worn Tommy Lee Jones, ""The Valley Of Elah,"" ""No Country For Old Men""), for being old, crotchety and just plain boring. K explains that this is just the way it is, but J believes there is something deeper going on.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement, ""Dinner For Scmucks,"" a voice in ""Rio"" and ""Despicable Me""), a powerful, brutish alien, is broken out of Lunar Max (a prison on the moon). He seeks the son of a scientist, Jeffrey Price (Michael Chernus, ""Love and Other Drugs,"" ""Higher Ground""), to travel back to 1969 and gain vengeance over Agent K for shooting off his arm and locking him up.<br/><br/>Then, one night, after hanging up on K, who was trying to explain some ""secrets"" to him, J is stunned to wake up in a different reality, a reality in which K has been dead for over 40 years.<br/><br/>Boris' mutant race is also massively invading Earth, which has no protection because it was K who designed a global anti-alien electronic net. With prompting from Agent O (Emma Thompson, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2""), J now has to go back to the summer of '69 and try to prevent his partner's murder and save the world.<br/><br/>He steals a Cadillac (and shames a few racist cops and and uses some lame ""modern"" hip-hop verbiage in the process), but is soon captured by a young K (Brolin) and found to have a slew of advanced alien-killing weapons on his person. Trying not to reveal his real intentions, J is finally forced to admit he is there to keep Boris from pulling off his evil deed.<br/><br/>There is also a strange otherworldly character, Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Hugo""), who tries to avoid Boris while passing along the planet's protection device. These scenes in 1969 are easily the most entertaining, with the wild colorful clothes, engaging pop music and ""Austin Power's Spy Who Shagged Me"" vibe which makes everyone from that era appear to be either Twiggy-like hipsters or extras from AMC's ""Mad Men.""<br/><br/>History fans may also appreciate a sequence of the New York Mets World Series triumph, as well as the July 16 Apollo 11 moon launch, while Bill Hader (""SNL,"" ""Adventureland"") does a hilarious (but all too short) Andy Warhol impersonation.<br/><br/>Along with Hader and Stuhlbarg earning kudos, Brolin, does a spot-on imitation of Jones and carries the movie to decent comedic heights (since Smith spends most of the motion picture in maudlin self-introspection). His Agent J character, in fact, is the least interesting one in this installment.<br/><br/>The direction (by Barry Sonnenfeld, ""Adams Family,"" ""Get Shorty,"" ""RV,"" Men In Black I and II) is workmanlike and the writing (Lowell Cunningham and David Koepp) fairly competent, but its the makeup and special effects which also adds to the enjoyment of this endeavor.<br/><br/>The movie also gives us an ""Empire Strikes Back"" moment in an attempt to tie up a few emotional loose ends. Not a bad effort to (hopefully) end the series with, despite the fact that few - except the most ardent fanatics - were clamoring for such an effort."

","Will Smith was at the top of his fame when he made the first of these films.

It doesn't quite pull it off, but there is a fair bit to like here.<br/><br/>Lots of the standard sequel plot lines are followed, and if nothing else James Brolin can say that he can do a good Tommy lee Jones impression.<br/><br/>I think they should leave the franchise here though."

","I just saw this film here in Taipei and I must say it was brilliantly entertaining. I won't give too much away (Semi-spoiler alert) or over hype the film for anybody who has not seen it. All I will say is that it is full of laughs, edge-of-your-seat thrills, and even a few tears. This film truly brings the series full circle and has a surprise that will put a smile on any MIB fan's face! Don't expect the same characters from movies past to have any sort of dominant role (Agent J and K excluded of course). This MIB comes at you from a whole new angle! 1969, Apollo, Civil Rights, Andy Warhol, the list goes on and on. It's a fascinating re-mix of the well established franchise that is sure to delight many a moviegoer. I hope it entertains everybody else as much as it entertained me!"

"TheSquiss","4","6","11","17 June 2012"," Ideal for those with low expectations
","It had to be done. There was an empty evening, a slot to fill in the blog and the potential of a fun, innovative film.<br/><br/>The short version is that Men in Black III is better than the second outing but doesn't hit the originality or the highs of the first. The biggest issue is there just isn't anything terribly new on offer. There are no great surprises, no universes hiding in a locker, no shock revelations of politicians or celebrities hailing from worlds on the other side of our imaginations. Yes, there are hints and mentions but they feel like ticks on a checklist. So much of Men in Black III does.<br/><br/>Will Smith is on good form, maintains his perpetually young appearance, gives the cheeky chappy performance we've come to expect and (mostly) accept and carries the film without inspiring us; Tommy Lee Jones is predictably miserable/stoical/deadpan – delete as you see fit; Barry Sonnenfield returns to direct using the same map and instructions; Danny Elfman revisits the series with his third score in typical, entertaining but, in this instance, not overly inspiring fashion.<br/><br/>The surprises come, firstly and in a minor way, from Emma Thompson, who fills the gap left by Rip Torn's absent Zed as Agent O. She plays a familiar mummsy-with-a-slight-edge role but with the expected level of humour and sincerity we've come to expect. She's not going to increase her Oscar haul (two and counting) with this but it's a performance of the expected quality. The surprise is simply that she's in Men in Black III at all.<br/><br/>More surprising is Josh Brolin's uncannily accurate portrayal of the younger Agent K. His voice, mannerisms and miserable/stoical/deadpan – delete as you see fit – performance is remarkably close to that of Tommy Lee Jones. It's not easy playing a younger version of a familiar character; just ask Ewan McGregor, although Brolin has the advantage of playing a part that is nowhere near as beloved and iconic as Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br/><br/>I'm far less happy with Jermaine Clement's (he of The Flight of the Conchords fame) waltz through the film as Boris The Animal. It's not so much a case of scenery-chewing as Brian Blessed on crack and chomping everything in sight. For a while it's entertaining and one is left to marvel at how he manages to say anything at all with those teeth filling two thirds of his mouth, but it very quickly becomes tedious as he attempts to roar in a slightly different way.<br/><br/>It's entertaining, it'll thrill the children with low expectations and the drunks with depleted brain cells but, actually, I think I'll give Wild, Wild West another shot before I sit through Men in Black III again. At least it boasts the former Mrs Thompson, Kenneth Branagh.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss. For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk"

","I don't know how they do it but even after the first release of MIB in 1997, they made Will Smith look almost as young as he was back then and made Tommy Lee Jones look just as old as he has always been in this movie series.<br/><br/>To be frank, MIB movie plots haven't ever been 'very great' or 'smart'. But the good thing with MIB has always that they have been hilarious with their dumb plots and that's what keeps the movie interesting. You take out funny aliens and the talking dog from the movie, it doesn't remain so attractive anymore. Leaving out the countable funny scenes from the movie, I felt the movie overall was kind of ""mushy""... sniff! They put too much emotions at place where it was not required... Another part that I admired in the prequels were the funny dialogs exchanged between Lee Jones and Will Smith, former being a tight a$$ and latter being the funny guy!<br/><br/>* Spoiler Alert ahead * In this series as Will Smith goes back in the past to meet younger Lee Jones, the movie missed to cash out on their chemistry too.<br/><br/>What was good with the movie was the character of all the MIB agents. Will Smith, Lee Jones and Josh Brolin (younger Lee Jones) all have acted very well in all the movies and all fit perfectly in their role. Although I felt the Alien Griffin was being pushed into scenes to help our heroes. Either ways, I have no complaints with the acting of characters in the movie.<br/><br/>My suggestion: Don't be surprised if you don't end up watching a MIB movie not-so-hilarious as its prequels when you go to watch MIB 3."

It seems the story was good but something happened with how the movie was done. There were only a few chuckles in this movie. Nothing really funny like in the previous two. Good movies will have you captivated to the point you forget you are watching a movie. We felt like we were just sitting in the theatre burning time until the last 10-15 min. of the movie. I thought the ending was really good and it tied in really well to the story line of all 3 films. The special effects were great and many people will be happy with that.

On the other hand Emma Thompson is wasted. TLJ is definitely looking his age. Will Smith doesn't look that convincing either The insults to late 60s idealism are cheap and unfair. The whole thing reeks of a cheap attempt to make a few more bucks out of the franchise. The time-travel thing is a bit of a cliché. Shame really because TLJ and WS have good chemistry.

And I would be surprised if it can..<br/><br/>First lets take with the characters, well take the Jemaine Clement, which plays the main 'evil'-guy and gives probably the most convincing role, but the character he plays is filled so much with ""evil-shallowness"", and if it could just be at least something to laugh upon, but I don't find this the case through the movie.. Then its Will Smith, with no jokes upon him(which makes him shine in Prince of Bell Air for instance) and the character he plays is not convincing.. Tommy Lee Jones rude behaviour puts me waaay back. The only that I find at least somehow convincing is Josh Brolin, and I don't know why, but the parts he plays I find the best..<br/><br/>And its not about the its the directing part in today movies that gives me the impression that there is somebody always laughing at me, making the 'best' crap of movies they can, and then smiling faces, myself realizing that people would bought that stuff.

","When a movie has a shallow plot, comic-book characters, overblown special effects, and lead actors who, due to the sheer passage of time, no longer seem right for their roles, something has to do be done to make the movie watchable, and this the movie accomplishes in the person of Josh Brolin. Mr. Brolin's performance saves this movie from a quick exit to DVD-land. He brings an intensity to the role that galvanizes the movie. The plot itself is so contrived as to render it ludicrous; its lack of substance is apparent throughout. Hence, the movie depends on strong performances which, with the exception of Mr. Brolin's, it does not provide. Reprising roles from the past can be tricky, and in the case of Will Smith, it does not work. He is a wonderful actor but not in this movie; his role is no longer the right one for him.

So, I may have suffered a fatal brain aneurysm somewhere along the way.<br/><br/>This movie seemed to feel that world was clamoring for another go at the first MIB movie except with the all of the humorous bits removed or made so painfully self aware that you feel like gawkers at a comedy ten car crash scene.<br/><br/>We also got to again revisit the joke that every weird looking or weird acting person on the planet is a space alien. Because no matter how many thousands of times you do that joke, how could it ever NOT be funny? Am I right? Am I right? Am I right or am I right?<br/><br/>Will Smith has apparently decided that he is such a bouncing off the walls, superfly, laugh-a-minute, comedy machine, that what has been lacking in his movies is not enough boring, uptight, straight white men to fail to laugh at his jokes. <br/><br/>So both Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones get to play the steely faced, no nonsense, all business partner people types who will play total non-reaction so well when Will lets his full wacky out of the cage.<br/><br/>We also get a love interest along the way. But it doesn't really matter who or when or where or why. Since the people and the plot points have become completely interchangeable and irrelevant at this point. The scenes play with all the raw animal magnetism of a flight attendant giving the seat belt lecture before takeoff.<br/><br/>I like Will Smith, I like Tommy Lee Jones.

It is easy to see why the movie makes you become disappointed as you watch the other series it was more fresh and different to other sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>As been a fan for over 10 years of Men in black its clear to see that the last movie MIB3, in the series is only been made to profit from the end of world and sci-fi atmosphere created by the mass hype the end of the world.

I mean, considering the two awesome parts of this movie, i went in the hall with huge amount of expectations but MIB 3 turned out to be a huge low-blow.<br/><br/>A nutshell- start was a bit good, but what happened to the story writers. MIB franchise is well known for its messy and ugly creatures from outer space. Those were no where to be seen. We love the chemistry of Agent J & K, not the chemistry between Agent J & young agent K. small role of Tommy lee also added to the negative points.

But no talking dog in this one and you will probably miss him. What more? The viewers will see the emotional bond strengthen between Agent K and Agent J.<br/><br/>Boris The Animal (Jemaine Clement) and Agent K has a dark past as a result of which the demon was locked up in a prison on the Moon. Years later, he escapes with vengeance over K and kills him by time travelling to the past.<br/><br/>Men In Black III leaps back in time to 1969 just before the launch of the Appolo where Agent J (Will Smith) has to save the life of Agent K (Tomy Lee Jones) from the spidery hands of Boris by killing him from the past. There is time travelling several times that makes you confused. But you will not get messed up rethinking about it. And you guys are sure to enjoy watching the younger K back in 1969 who is wittier. You need not keep a track on the previous films to understand MIB 3.<br/><br/>Will Smith, just like in the earlier parts, takes up the centre stage and rocks as Agent J. His spontaneous dialogues and witty jokes never get you bored. Compared to the earlier movies, Tomy has a not much of screen space this time as his younger version takes up the role as J's partner, portrayed by Josh Brolin.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin has taken the special effort to be the young K. His impersonation of Tomy's character is flawless and the most convincing. Well, with a little wit of course. No wonder J keeps asking 'what happened to you?'<br/><br/>The movie has less action and adventure with no high-tech machines compared to previous movies which might disappoint some of the MIB followers. Well, you can't expect 'neuralizer' and specialized guns way back in 1969 which K himself had invented later.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Etan Kohen and direction by Barry Sonnenfield stands out and the 3D works for the movie. But the Stephen Spielberg touch is missed as he is not produced it this time. Danny Elfman complemented the movie with great music.<br/><br/>The movie is a must watch for the loyal Men In Black followers and watch it for Will, Tom and Josh."

An alien called Boris escapes from a jail on the moon with a big beef for Agent K.<br/><br/>The alien goes back in time and kills his younger self, thus making K non existent for over forty years. J then has to go back to 1969 and save the younger K before an invasion happens.<br/><br/>But we do get to find out why K is so miserable all the time.<br/><br/>To start off, the film is decidedly average, up until the last ten minutes. If you haven't been given any spoilers of the film, try not to, get over the first average hour or so, you will be surprised.<br/><br/>The film really does wrap up the whole franchise, and if this were to be last MIB movie, I wouldn't ave any complaints.<br/><br/>Smith is how you would expect him to be, cocky but with an edge of seriousness, Jones' role is nothing more than an extended cameo, but Brolin has really nailed the part of the younger K.<br/><br/>It took me until after the film to realise that Jones' was only in it for just over ten minutes, Brolin is that good, as is the flow of the film.<br/><br/>Clement is good as the villain, but nothing special, as are the aliens, they used to be the main things about this film, but the are not very spectacular.<br/><br/>I laughed twice throughout the whole film, so it's not the funniest thing out there, but it's amusing.<br/><br/>So it's a lot better than I feared, but this is all thanks to the fabulous ending, if it wasn't for this, it would have been a sorry excuse for a film, it's a shame that the rest of the film isn't as good as this."
"jadepietro","5","7","15","30 May 2012"," MIB3: Time is Not Their Friend
","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>The successful Men in Black series has finally turned three this year, after a 10 year hiatus. It still tries to incorporate its winning formula of sardonic humor, otherworldly creatures, and top-notch visual effects. However this time, it throws in time travel as a plot device, making this installment all the more warped, yet somehow less entertaining.<br/><br/>The plot remains simple: Agent J, with excessive mugging from Will Smith, travels back in time to 1969 to save the life of his partner Agent K ( an underused Tommy Lee Jones ), but more importantly, save the world from yet another alien invasion. Perhaps they should have save the time and money and reworked the screenplay instead.<br/><br/>Men in Black III was plagued with many re-writes as the script was incomplete when production started. And this lack of cohesiveness shows. But, at least, this high concept blockbuster brings to its third sequel the clever concept of time travel and its most creative idea of casting Josh Brolin as Tommy Lee Jones' younger self. It is a brilliant move that pays off and elevates a film that suffers from plot lows and too many non-comedic highs.<br/><br/>Barry Sonnenfeld, who helmed the original first film, still brings his inventive flair for direction to the series. Unfortunately, the script by Etan Cohen lacks real humor and peril. Interesting characters, like Emma Thompson's Agent O and Nicole Scherzinger as Boris the Animal's girlfriend, are introduced, dispatched, or are no longer involved with the plot mechanics. The production design by Bo Welch continue to have a creative edge, but the creatures, this time around, are not very innovative or as amusing as before. Plus, the CGI is rather unexceptional and humdrum ( as is the 3-D format ).<br/><br/>The droll banter that was a comic staple in the previous installments is sorely missing and there are so many lost opportunities poking fun at the late sixties trends and ""vibes"" that could have made the film's reversal of time refreshing and nostalgic while it engages its movie-going audience. None of that happens.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it's nondescript. Smith tries to be charming and hip and fails miserably. Jones seems to be walking through his role, adding no depth of character. There is absolutely no chemistry with Smith or his younger or older partner for that matter. The film's bland one-dimensional villain, Boris the Animal, played by Jemaine Clement, has no truly interesting traits, except throwing deadly stakes at intended victims and grousing in a studio- enhanced voice that reverberates too often and is merely artificial and annoying. The only two actors that come off unscathed are the aforementioned Brolin, who steals the film with his uncanny impersonation of Agent K which produces some needed laughs, and Michael Stuhlbarg who delivers some emotional heft and boyish charm as a new character named Griffin who can see the future.<br/><br/>I suppose that Men in Black III may be a mindless diversion from some moviegoers. But, for me, it became a pointless exercise that regurgitated its formulaic sci-fi fantasy elements with no real payoff. The film ultimately disappoints and loses its own sense of originality and whimsy in this third outing. <br/><br/>One doesn't need the memory eraser device used by the agents in Men in Black III. The film will do that very well on its own as you are immediately leaving the theater.

","Men In Black are back. 15 years after the first (and best) film in the series Hollywood tries to squeeze some more dollars from the same idea.Sequels are never easy to do. You need both to ensure continuity and bring back what the audiences love in the original and invent so that the repetition does not bring exhaustion and disappointment. Best examples of success like The Godfather or Star Wars were complex stories spreading over generations, developing memorable characters and bringing to screen new emotions and passions in each one of the new installments, even if they not all were as best as the initial films. Well, MIB is no Godfather or Star Wars, neither is Barry Sonnenfeld a Scorsese or George Lucas. Men In Black III has more downs than ups.<br/><br/>The good news first? Well, it's available (also) on 3D. Don't forget to order 3D tickets as I did, as many of the screenings are banal 2D. Hint - the tickets on 3D are even more expensive that usual. Two new actors join the team - Josh Brolin doing a fine job as a young version of Tommy Lee Jones' character (yes, good guess, there is some time travel involved) and Emma Thompson who is always lovely to see, even when she has a too thin part as here. The less than good news? Well, there are no surprises, no new jokes to remember, no ideas that make the film really different or funnier or scarier than the previous series. The retro parts are very much the same we have seen in scores of other films since Back to the Future, the bad guy has bad teeth, and the story has holes as big as the cosmic warps with a touch of melodrama that does not add really anything good.<br/><br/>Is it worth paying the ticket to see the film in theaters? Well, maybe yes, if you are in 'just' for entertainment and you are ready to accept conventions and to put logic to rest for a couple of hours, than you have chances to enjoy the film. If you are a MIB aficionado you will go and see it anyway, so I can just wish you to have fun!"

","Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return as Agents J and K sort of. Before you know it, K's wisped off as if he never existed – at least in his partner's lifetime. The main villain is an imprisoned alien named Boris the Animal. The angry goon, resembling a mutant biker, has one arm thanks to Agent K years earlier. After breaking out of the moon's prison, Boris goes back in time and kills K for revenge.<br/><br/>To resurrect his partner, J leaps into the 1960's where young K works for The Agency. For a little while the film becomes a 48 HRS replica: the hard-nosed ""cop"" doesn't trust the energetic ""convict"" who keeps begging for a gun. Although it takes some talking into, K's soon convinced of their basic mission: kill the bad guy to save himself and the earth won't be taken over.<br/><br/>Sound confusing? Well some parts are – but it doesn't matter. There's a few good action scenes that occur much too quickly and the counter-culture shock (including a run-in with Andy Warhol) seems a mere distraction. Josh Brolin as the young K imitates his NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN co-star dependably and has decent chemistry with Smith. But they're joined by an annoying alien who, resembling a dimwitted college student wearing a snow cap, provides so much exposition about the ""time continuum"" our heroes have little to figure out on their own.<br/><br/>The climax, set at the Apollo 11 launch, lacks the bombastic punch of the original. And the lesser aliens along the way are too bright and flashy and'90's-looking, most likely an intentional homage to the fifteen-year-old predecessors – but a better script (and villain) would have helped.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","First of all, I want to thank the Danbarry Dollar Saver cinemas for showing this terrible film at a low price because had I paid full price for two tickets (one for me and one for my wife) I might have given up going to the movie theater altogether. So Danbarry, I thank you for keeping my cinema watching hobby alive! <br/><br/>It's not often my wife and I sit in a theater and consider leaving before the film is over. If I recall, we've only had this conversation twice during a movie (I can't remember the last movie because it was so long ago). This morning, however, it is clear as day to me this very real conversation my wife and I had last night while watching this film. She strongly recommended we leave so she can get to bed and get more sleep (in retrospect, this was the best course of action). I responded by saying that we should at least try and finish the movie in hopes that we'll find something about it that we like. 1 point for my wife: For those keeping score at home that's my wife 102, me 4. Her instincts are seemingly much better than my logic!<br/><br/>With that said, let me share why this film was so awful:<br/><br/>First of all, where is the unique writing that we saw from MiB 1 and some from MiB 2? The concept for this movie is interesting but the writing makes it flat and 1 dimensional. At some point, we lose interest in the concept and simply watch the characters (Smith and Brolin) go from point A to point B in a monotonous fashion. It's like the writers reached into a hat for plot moving sequences written on slips of paper making it rough on the viewer to not only understand what's going on (the ""Griffin"" character is completely frustrating and useless) but to really even care. The only time I became interested was the Cape Canaveral scene, but even in this climactic scene, it eventually falls flat.<br/><br/>Secondly, Will Smith isn't funny. His jokes are child-like knee slappers that, you guessed it, the kids in the movie theater found hilarious. To be fair, this is mostly due to the bad writing: Smith is supposed to throw out his usually funny contextually driven zingers and they normally come off as spot on comedy. In this film, however, because the writing is so bad, the jokes come off as flat and Smith kind of looks like a circus clown. How many adults out there find circus clowns comedic? <br/><br/>Third, the character development downright stinks. Boris, Griffin, young and old Agent O, and even Tommy Lee Jones character is awful. All of these characters are boring and one dimensional (like this film). Some of the aforementioned characters such as Agent O, Griffin, and the Andy Warhol character are pointless. I hate when films add pointless characters because anything they do doesn't contribute to the moving of the plot. Josh Brolin is the only one who has any real character development, but eventually, even he becomes useless to this film's pointless plot.<br/><br/>Now to be fair, this film would be pretty cool if you were a kid, which I""m not sure if that's who the film is directed to? It's confusing because you have child-like plot advancement with Will Smith punchlines laced throughout but inserted with adult contextual humor. It's really awkward. Children watching this film would love the action scenes and the one line zingers but would be confused about most other things in this movie (especially the 1969 references and others).<br/><br/>The film can best be described in this dialogue between Will Smith and some guy (I'd tell you his name but I forget and he's a worthless character anyway) who has the time control device. I'm paraphrasing almost all of this because I don't have enough respect for the film to find the actual lines nor do they even matter:<br/><br/>SOME GUY: I have the time control device but in order for us to use it, we have to get really high. SMITH: what? No! no way! SOME GUY: on the roof....it's called a time JUMP <br/><br/>audience reaction: *crickets"

","When I started this IMDb-commented study 14 years ago, the notions of folded narrative were commonly used, but not so open in the industry. Now look where we've come, to a state where it is mandatory for a blockbuster investment. You know something has passed its freshness when even the common term for doing so has 'jumped the shark.'<br/><br/>The folding dynamic I'm talking about is the simple trick of putting an audience member into the story. The theory is that this helps us get engaged with the story. It is not a dumb idea; with film, we really do have a body of evidence that this — in many varieties — actually works.<br/><br/>But this particular device as handled here seemed a bit desperate. I suppose that is congruent with the general feel of desperation in the project, desperation to recoup costs.<br/><br/>Our on-screen surrogate is a character named Griffin. He is from 'another dimension' and can watch and rewatch, coming to story knees that he likes. He announces when things are getting engaging. 'Touching' him allows sharing with his vision. Griff has control over his place in time, which place is the main plot point in the story —<br/><br/>Why we know this came from a consultant and passed by dull investment types? Because it is so blatant. The actor was chosen because he plays this identical role in 'Hugo.' He is introduced to us at a party at the Factory, where Warhol is revealed to be an actor of the inner story, playing a role. He provides a device that locks and preserves the world of the story.<br/><br/>Two other factors are possibly subliminal influences...<br/><br/>I am writing this comment on a visit to LA, specifically to a neighborhood where these types of consultants live, 'observer consultants.' The area is 'the observatory area,' Griffith Observatory. In the comic 'Zippy the Pinhead' a character named Griff frequently looks down at Hollywood goings on with a telescope from the observatory.<br/><br/>A deeper connection with the name is the griffin. This is hybrid creature invented by the Achaemenid Persians (Darius, Cyrus) whose culture was deeply folded. The Griffin (half eagle, half lion) was a symbol inspired by the Zoroastrian (the original Zoroastrians) notion of a being that can see and control itself, that good 'speaking' had both a story and a story about a story. The entire notion of two-worlds, two logics was destroyed by the Greeks and replaced with logic and truth. But the notion persists in folds in literature.<br/><br/>Lewis Carroll reconnected the beast with the role in his Alice works. As I say, the level at which Hollywood works is more Zippy than Achaemenid, but that connection is there.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","Men In Black 3 started off with a very uninteresting beginning introducing one of worse villains to ever be seen in film with the most annoying and fairly stupid voice. This was the beginning of a very poorly written script that relied heavily on the actors ability to make each and every scene work. The actors did a fantastic job. Pointless expensive shots run throughout the entire film. Expensive doesn't mean good. There was nothing really there in this film. It was not exciting and didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. If not for the actors performances this would have been a complete tragedy. Men and Black 3 is not even worth seeing in theaters. If you really wanna see it wait for the DVD/Blu Ray or better yet download it. Personally a very big let down.<br/><br/>It is a pretty average film overall and is a good addition to the Men in Black franchise. It just didn't have enough oomph in my personal opinion."

","I like the principals in this movie Will Smith, Josh Brolin, etc., they're good in just about everything they've ever been involved in. It just feels like over-sequelitis in this third go around of the Men in Black franchise. In my opinion, each succesive installment has become less interesting. The story line here is lame, particularly the last 20 minutes or so. I saw it in 3-D and the effects are good but I would expect them to be GREAT given the very high cost of admission. Some of the continuity from the previous two MIB films has been altered and that kind of annoyed me. If I had it to do over again I would probably have preferred to wait for it to come to Redbox and rent it for a buck. That's about all it's worth."

","10 years after critics seriously bashed the second ""Men in Black"" movie. The Same Director and stars give it another shot. The Result being another mediocre sequel. Though one that is trying a damn-sight harder than the last one.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not going to say which off the two ""Men in Black"" sequels is better, because too be honest, I don't remember the last one all too well. But this one is at least destined to be remembered as the time travelling one. Ye Will Smith has too go back in time too save Tommy Lee Jone's life in the 60's, and the younger Jones is perfectly played there by a great Josh Brolin.<br/><br/>I like the new direction this movie went in, but it's still a diminishing sequel. There are some laughs but just as many off the gags are embarrassing. Plus the effects don't quite work without the 3D. It could off still been saved by its ""out there"" plot.

"blueblaze360","1","6","13","28 September 2012"," If you are expecting a fun, family friendly movie, this is not it.
","I watched this movie thinking it was to be another fun Men in Black movie... Something that could be enjoyed by the whole family, young and old. I was wrong. Besides being boring (it may have picked up later in the movie, but I stopped watching half way through), it was full of racism, bad jokes and a dubious representation of the time most of the movie was set (the late 60s). Needless to say, I didn't laugh once and was probably more annoyed than amused. <br/><br/>The Fresh Prince has gotten old and I would have hoped Will Smith matured beyond this kind of role. At 44 he's still acting like a juvenile for the cameras. Still, it was ultimately the writers and director's responsibility to make the movie palatable for its target audience (??). It's been 10+ years since the first movie was released, you'd think they would have tried to mature Agent J's character a little...or hire somebody younger to fill the role. <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones was bland, but what would you expect? Etan Cohen and Barry Sonnenfeld are probably to blame most for this stinker, as they wrote and directed it. <br/><br/>To summarize: If you are expecting a fun family friendly movie, this is not it."
"moviexclusive","6","8","19","21 May 2012"," Lacking the inspiration and energy of the original, MIB3 nonetheless rehashes the odd-couple chemistry between Agents J and K for a passably entertaining blast-from-the-past
","There's an undeniable staleness that 'Men in Black 3' can't quite shake off, the third movie in the franchise that arrives ten years after the first sequel and 15 years since the original. No, we're not talking about the fact that director Barry Sonnenfeld once again banks the movie on the offbeat chemistry of the genuinely affable Agent J and the lovably gruff Agent K- which to be honest is still the best thing the series has going for it. Rather, the premise is too familiar, the gags are less inspired, and the story- sans the surprisingly moving finale- feels tired.<br/><br/>And no wonder really, since this third-parter was effectively shepherded into production without a finished script- so much so that filming had to shut down midway so that professional Hollywood script doctors David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson, as well as Will Smith's personal dialogue doctor Mike Soccio, could refine the original writing from six screenwriters (of which only Etan Cohen receives a credit). From what we see of the finished product, it hasn't helped much, and the very faults that made Sonnenfeld pull the plug in the midst of shooting are still all too apparent.<br/><br/>Once again, the mission is yet another rogue alien threatening the future of the planet, who also happens to be the lone survivor of a hostile alien race. Played with cool menace by Jermaine Clement (of 'Flight of the Conchords'), Boris the Animal has been holed up in lunar prison for the past 40 years after being apprehended by none other than Agent K. So following an exciting opening sequence featuring a slinky Nicole Scherzinger, Boris breaks out of his confinement and vows revenge on K for maiming him the last time they met.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the buddy-cop dynamic is still alive and well between Will Smith's Agent J and Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K- though back at HQ, chief Z (Rip Torn) has been killed off and replaced by an unexpectedly quirky Agent O (Emma Thompson). Z's death also begets one of the funniest scenes in the movie, where both Agents K and O take turns demonstrating the social ineptitude of the agency through their respective eulogies.<br/><br/>In keeping with the brisk economical pace of the first two movies, it isn't long before J and K come face to face with Boris and his nefarious gang of alien allies in a Chinese restaurant that offers otherworldly delicacies for its extraterrestrial customers. That brilliantly shot shootout also forms the culmination of the first act, undoubtedly the best among the film's three-act structure, combining some thrilling action choreography with the ever-fascinating menagerie of alien types conceived by series regular Rick Baker.<br/><br/>What promise there was at the beginning however quickly falls apart in the second and third act, which employs the oft-used time-travel narrative device to bring J back to 1969. That's the year Boris was caught and imprisoned by K, and the inter-galactic marauder has since transported himself back in time to assassinate said agent. Except for an alien with a detachable head J uses as a bowling ball as well as a multi-dimensional seer Griffin, there isn't much out-of-this-world fun that this middle act offers.<br/><br/>Instead, Sonnenfeld turns the joke on J by constantly riffing on the unlikely pairing between him and a 29-year-old K (Josh Brolin). Turns out that K wasn't always the curmudgeon J had known him to be, which provides a welcome change of dynamics between J and K compared to the last two movies. While there's no denying that Brolin is very good at replicating Jones' deadpan mannerisms, it is a one-note gag that soon loses its novelty and would have even more quickly lost its appeal were it not for the fantastic chemistry between Smith and Brolin.<br/><br/>As is prerequisite for any time-travel movie, Sonnenfeld pokes fun at the icons and prevailing social norms of the era. Nonetheless, J's run- in with a pair of racist cops while driving a stolen luxury car falls flat; while a sequence alluding to the Age of Aquarius set in Andy Warhol's Factory (with Bill Hader playing the larger-than-life character as a secret MIB agent) again fails to inspire much hilarity despite the screenwriters' valiant attempts at generating some laughs through an awkwardly cast misunderstanding between Warhol and J.<br/><br/>There is a surprising reliance on exposition within the second act, but some middling plot developments and uninteresting dialogue undermine an otherwise more character-driven approach than the previous films. Only in the third and final act when both heroes and villiains young and old descend on Cape Canaveral for the launch of the Apollo 11 moon module does the movie regain its lost momentum, though the overblown finale rarely matches up to the pizazz of the earlier climax in the first act.<br/><br/>Thankfully, a last-minute twist that casts the relationship between J and K in a whole different light provides unexpected poignancy that will be especially fulfilling for fans of the series- though as is typical of time-travel premises, this one also requires you to look past its logical loopholes. The backbone of the trilogy has always been the odd- couple pairing of J and K, and whether the original Tommy Lee Jones or new entrant Josh Brolin, both capture the enjoyably idiosyncratic nature of their original banter.<br/><br/>Not without its attendant pleasures therefore, 'Men in Black 3' makes for a passably entertaining affair that- like its immediate predecessor- fails to live up to the spirit and energy of the original. Indeed, despite an invigorating first act, the rest of the film- which had to be sent to the script clinic while shooting- is only intermittently entertaining with both its gags and dialogues lacking inspiration. Those looking for a firm dose of nostalgia will still find it here, thanks to winning performances by Smith, Jones and Brolin- but there's only so much fun you can have with the old and familiar."
"nbwritersinbox","8","3","5","29 January 2013"," Did Columbia Make This Film Just For Me?
","I am gonna say it... This film is as good as the first one.<br/><br/>It's a roller coaster ride from frame one. The production and writing teams don't make the mistake of being complacent, as can so often happen in a third installment. No-one messed too much with Elfman's engaging and original soundtrack, either. <br/><br/>Old themes are revisited, but some clever plot twists, Sixties references (which I loved being a child of that Era) combined with fresh and interesting characters put MIB 3 on a par with the now classic MIB 1.<br/><br/>The comedy dialogue is snappy too. I found myself chuckling through most of the scenes where Smith plays off Tommy Lee's deadpan style that worked so well in previous MIBs.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is superb as Young Agent K, adopting Tommy Lee Jones mannerisms and inflections with spooky skill. Jermaine Clement is a convincingly psychotic Super Baddie, assisted by outstanding CGI that the Special Effects Team have perfected on MIB films.<br/><br/>The plot races along but I won't mind watching this film a few times to try and understand everything that passes. Right at its centre is a feel good story that ties up a few loose threads. I won't spoil the ending for those yet to see it, but I did shed a tear."

It's not the bickering per se that I can not take but WHAT they bicker about, making it seem like J is a nooblet who just started. <br/><br/>Another continuity problem is how K has this big secret room and some huge personal plan to defend earth from aliens that no one else knows of, something that anyone with average intelligence would share with others or at least SOMEONE before going into retirement and erasing his memory like he did in MIB 2.<br/><br/>Other than that the story feels like a mix of the two previous movies and adds nothing new, interesting or exciting. Also, I was expecting to see K going into retirement once again but that didn't happen which doesn't feel logical at all having a guy in his eighties running around chasing bugs and I honesty thought after watching K and J fall down from the roof and seeing K's face afterwards that his career was going to be over."

"bruins1231995","10","4","8","11 January 2013"," Will Smith discovers Agent K's secret
","Director Barry Sonnenfeld's Men in Black 3 had some production issues throughout the years and that's why it took until last year for it to come out. Because of a stoppage and a script rewrite, the beginning, middle, and end were not really put together, but it really didn't show in the movie. The film began when an evil alien known as Boris The Animal who is played by Jemaine Clement manages to escape from a maximum security prison on the moon. Boris wants to take revenge on Agent K who is played by Tommy Lee Jones. <br/><br/>Boris uses time travel and goes back to 1969. The year that his plans for world domination were disrupted and kills the young Agent K, leaving Agent J played by Will Smith living in a future without his longtime partner. After discovering what is going on, Agent J travels back in time himself to both stop young Agent K who is played by Josh Brolin from being murdered and save the world from Boris. This movie almost makes you think that everything happening in the movie is happening in real life. At the very least the script does give a good platform for the film's uniformly great performances. <br/><br/>Will Smith shows that he still has plenty of spunk and chemistry left with Jones, verbal timing and physical humor. Though it's a tad gimmicky, I thought Josh Brolin did a great job using his impression of Tommy Lee Jones as the young Agent K. Josh Brolin wasn't the star of the show, Michael Stuhlbarg was the star. Playing an alien known as Griffin, a being that can see all possible time lines and variations of universes at once, Michael Stuhlbarg is a thrill to watch as he thinks out loud about what's going to happen next and worries about the most negative of outcomes. <br/><br/>It's a wonderful performance backed with an interesting character design and the highlight of the movie. Once the movie finally travels back to the late 60s, the story actually gets interesting and is just clever enough to keep the audience's attention. As with the other films in the series, there are many mysteries hidden throughout such as Tim Burton and Yao Ming play aliens on monitors in the Men in Black headquarters, and Bill Hader plays Andy Warhol, who is just an undercover MiB agent out of ideas. This is the best movie I have seen and is going to be a classic. Just having Will Smith should make you want to watch it."

The jokes are just not funny and even embarrassing. watching this in the theater, in some point i was just surfing on my mobile facebook, wandering when will it be over?? i really loved the first MIB film, which was breath-taking and sophisticated. the second one wasn't near as good but still entertaining enough, the third is just stupid. seems like all they want is our ticket money, so i recommend you NOT to watch this in the theater. find other ways to see it, it just doesn't bring any justice to the franchise. i give it 5 out of 10 for some stunning special effects, the best i have seen since Avatar(2009) which by the way HAD A STORY!!<br/><br/>5 out of 10 for the secret agents that protect us from the scum of the universe!"
"Remy_Azhary","6","6","14","24 May 2012"," Lackluster overall but with quite an original ending
","The whole ""time-travel"" thing did not really work for me. I mean one must tread ever so lightly and delicately with great care when putting premises of time-travel on screen. The idea itself may sound interesting but it may not probably be a good idea even if you're a pure science-fiction purist or in the written words. For the H.G. Wells' classic novel, maybe but it did not even work well for its screen version of the 2002 Guy Pearce's THE TIME MACHINE. And it definitely did not work well for this one either. Thus, I was right to be skeptical about having time-travel plot in this movie. See the danger lies of the whole time-travel thing to be both tacky and cheesy if it was not done tastefully and it shows in MIB³. Though I must admit that this is after all a movie with great emphasis on visual effects and they were no doubt pleasing to the eyes; the storyline, on the other hand, was not quite as impressive as the first two films.<br/><br/>This one appeared to display that lackluster performance on screen especially with the absence of Rip Torn as 'Agent Zed'. Perhaps, this is one of the aspects that MIB³ did not ""feel"" like MEN IN BLACK at all. And it was that conspicuous.<br/><br/>I was also hoping that with Emma Thompson's appearance in this version would add that certain freshness to the film particularly a bigger credit to her range of roles where Thompson was usually typecast as playing a lady of prim and proper mannerisms in period dramas. Yet it did not happen for this third installment. Her on screen time was too brief and it seemed to be a little ""off"" for a female agent with a British accent in this supposedly a film about an American governmental organization. Moreover, there was almost no further development in terms of the romantic chemistry between her character and that of Tommy Lee Jones' 'Agent K' whom the former played Jones' love interest as told in the 1960s part of the movie as opposed to the rigid boss of the present day. Strangely though, I do appreciate her hairdo in this movie. It was sophisticated and good enough for a female corporate leader.<br/><br/>As seen in earlier MIB films, there were scenes of cameos appearing in the movies like the late Michael Jackson (or perhaps his double) in MEN IN BLACK 2. This one is no less impressive with the voluptuous and buxom lead vocalist of the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole Scherzinger, at the start to whet any guy's appetite for the film; and trust me, she was hot as hell. There was also moments where you could see Lady Gaga appearing on an overhead monitor in the MIB Headquarters; and if you're attentive enough you would be able to spot a moment of renowned director Tim Burton (whose dull DARK SHADOWS certainly bore me to tears).<br/><br/>All in all, although MEN IN BLACK 3 was so much better than the dull DARK SHADOWS it somehow felt nothing special to me.<br/><br/>But credit has to be given for ending of the film, which was probably the most original part of the movie, as the real relationship between Will Smith's 'Agent J' and Tommy Lee Jones' 'Agent K' was revealed and it came full circle as to link their true relationship.<br/><br/>Whatever it is if you have some money to spare and are dying to see MEN IN BLACK 3, see it for the blockbuster aspect of it. Other than that, do not expect much."

","Seriously? You have three massive acting talents in this movie and you can't even write a meaningful scene. I understand this is supposed to be lighthearted summer fare, but when your script doesn't even allow Wil Smith a laugh, you are in deep, deep trouble. The interaction between the two main characters, whom we know so very well by now, is not dynamic, playful, or engaging. It is abrasive, annoying, and toxic. It doesn't make you laugh, it makes you cringe. Fourteen years of working together to fend off alien menaces and these two don't can't engage one another. Shabby writing beefed up by expensive effects. The plot...what plot? We sat through this movie so that we could find out along with Agent J that hid dad was murdered by an alien during a rocket launch? and K hid this from him why? I sat through Green Lantern's entirety and yet I almost walked out of this ""film"" if I may use the term so poorly. Terrible to see someone as talented as Tommy Lee Jones in another horrible movie. This one makes me eager to see his sequel to the cheerleader chaperone vehicle. Who the hell is his agent???"
"DUKEJBM","Null","5","11","1 June 2012"," A completely unremarkable cotton candy movie
","I have to say that going in to this movie that I was expecting it to be absurd (how could it not given the other two efforts) but completely unremarkable I did not see coming. Along the lines of the first film but with less charm and really no solid action in my opinion, this film is a cotton candy and gas combination film. Bubbly sugar farts result and if that's what you're looking for then this is the perfect movie.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Will Smith hits all the right notes. Still, the logic flaws demand that the viewer can't take the film seriously even for a moment and there's not enough humor, heart or action to carry the movie any higher than an average to below average rating. I have to call this one a big let down."
"slightlymad22","8","2","3","12 June 2019"," My Favourite Men In Black Movie
","Men In Black 3 (2012)<br/><br/>Will Smith took an unheard of 4 years off (something he had never done before) after Seven Pounds, to help promote his children in show business. His daughter had a hit single with Whip My Hair and his son Jaden started in the remake of The Karate Kid and dabbled in music too. When he returned to the big screen, he played it safe and went with a sequel to one of his biggest hits.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Agent J (Smith) travels in time to M.I.B.'s early days in 1969 to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.<br/><br/>4 years is a long time between movies for an actor, and it's pretty much like American audiences didn't really care when he returned. Even in a big budget sequel, he couldn't crack the top 10. It is the highest grossing entry in the MIB series globally though.<br/><br/>Personally this is my favourite Men In Black movie, it's vastly superior to the second and more touching than the first. Josh Brolin totally steals the show as a young Tommy Lee Jones, who doesn't really have much to do. I'm not sure why Nicole Scherzinger was hired, what is nothing more than a cameo and some close ups of her boobs. Another nice performance for me was Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Griffin in what can only be described as a Robin Williams esque performance. He is a joy.<br/><br/>Men In Black grossed $179 million at the domestic box office, to end the year the 14th highest grossing movie of 2012."

","The 3rd part in this wonderful special trilogy is as spectacular & stunning as the first two films!!!
Now i love the ""MIB"" films & the 1997 original is my favourite movie ever & part 2 is a fantastic film & both i have watched a ridiculous amount of times over the years & now there's a 3rd film. Part 3 is very good & it's nice to see my childhood heroes again with Agent K & Agent J, i love the magic & chemistry of Smith & Jones & it's still here with the aging stars!!!<br/><br/>There's a lovely meaningful heartfelt back story & origins that's explored about Agent K & J.
The performances are excellent especially from Josh Brolin who play's a young K from 1969, his performance is spot-on & perfect & he's having so much fun with the role.
Will Smith is obviously great again & is funny,charming & very heart-warming on screen like seeing an old friend again as i grew up on the MIB films from the very first Classic back in 1997!!!
I absolutely love this franchise/trilogy & have always been a huge fan of Will Smith my childhood hero & idol & once again he's fantastic as Agent J.<br/><br/>There's a nice fresh time travel plot & some beautiful production design & sets of Coney island & New York City back in 1969, it looks beautiful.
There's lots of really fun moments & nice characters bits & scenes such as a lovely little scene where the young K sits in a Diner with Agent J & eat pie together & just chat, it's a lovely human scene.
The legendary veteran Tommy Lee Jones is great again as the much older & craggy Agent K & is great on screen although he's not in it all as the younger k takes over the most of the movie but equally excellent.
This film ties it all up nicely & is very enjoyable even if it's not as great as the first two films, there's still alot to like & some good humour & fun along the way, it's a solid 8/10 for me.<br/><br/>Boris the Animal is a great designed villain & very funny at times as Well as evil & just a fun monster.
This 3rd part has alot of Heart & is stunning to look at with it's detailed backgrounds & lovely cinematography.
Men in Black 3 is just a beautiful sci-fi action comedy with a big heart"

","By throwing time-travel into the fray, this belated third-entry does something a bit different and is much better for it, never quite reaching the heights of the first flick in the series but still being an entertaining time in its own right. What helps 'Men In Black 3 (2012)' is an almost perfect performance from Brolin as the young Jones, who gels almost as well with Smith in this entry as his older counterpart did before (who, here, just seems tired). It also has a unique setting that injects life into a somewhat stale premise, which is essentially the same as it has always been. 6/10"
"bdgill12","7","6","15","28 May 2012"," Fun and Worthy Sequel to the Original, Filled with Surprisingly Great Acting
","There are a number of issues and questions that pop up when you set out to make a sequel or prequel to a franchise that hasn't seen a new entry in a while. Do you reintroduce the characters to those who haven't seen the previous films or do you dive in and pretend everyone in the audience understands the narrative? Do you jump the timeline forward a few years or start from where the last film left off? Do you mature your characters and plot points to reflect the years gone by or do you continue to harp on the same strings that worked so well before? Men in Black 3 wrestles with each of these questions and manages to come out relatively unscathed on the other end.<br/><br/>It has been 14 years since Agent J (Will Smith) joined up with Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) as a member of the Men in Black, a covert agency that serves as both an embassy for alien visitors and protection from extra- terrestrial attacks. The dynamic between the two is much the same as it always has been: J still plays the part of the wise-cracking young upstart while K serves as the crotchety old-timer. Things take a turn, however, when an old enemy of K's, Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement), escapes from a prison on the moon and jumps back in time to kill K, an event which in turn leads to the destruction of earth. As the only person who remembers K in the present, J has to jump back to 1969 and re-team with a younger K (Josh Brolin) in order to track down Boris before he can accomplish his mission. <br/><br/>The early scenes of MIB3, in which the audience is reintroduced to the characters, are at best misguided and at worst painful. This reintroduction is a necessary endeavor given that the first Men in Black debuted 15 years ago and everyone likes to pretend the sequel never happened since it is BRUTALLY bad but the execution in this phase is poorly written to say the least. There's a distinct disconnect between Smith and Jones and whether that was done purposely to show the distance between the characters or not, it doesn't work. At times during the first 15 minutes, it feels as if Barry Sonnenfeld and the numerous writers who worked on this project couldn't decide whether to set the film years after the original or as more of a direct sequel taking place shortly after the '97 film. As a result, the two main characters treat each other as if they've only been partners for a few months while the narrative is clear concerning the timeframe. I had a hard time getting past this disjointedness and began bracing myself for a disastrous 103 minutes.<br/><br/>Thankfully, however, MIB3 finds its groove when J jumps back to 1969 and from that point on it's a fun ride. Throwing J into a drastically different environment brings about some interesting plot points and the film gets plenty of laughs based simply on the difference in technologies and attitudes. The hand-held Neuralizer (the ""flashy thing"") that J is used to in the present is actually a giant MRI-type machine in the early days of the Men in Black and of course J immediately gets himself into a spot of trouble pertaining to his race in a not-so liberated time period. The plot isn't always the brightest spot of the film but it does do an admirable job of managing its own time travel mythology, a task which often proves too difficult for many films that revolve around the concept.<br/><br/>But as fun as the storyline and general hijinks of MIB3 are, the real value of the movie can be found in the cast. Sonnenfeld lets Will Smith be Will Smith and that boisterous enthusiasm that has marked his career plays well within this setting. At the outset, Smith almost seems rusty, though perhaps that's just my subconscious taking over given how long it's been since we've seen him on screen. As the film finds its groove, so too does Smith and before long he's giving off the old vibes that have made him such a treat to watch over the last 15 years. But with all due respect to Smith, he is thoroughly overshadowed by his surrounding cast. Brolin is, simply, put, incredibly awesome in this role. His impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones is flawless but through a few plot points, he is able to make the character his own in ways that I didn't expect. He demonstrates great chemistry with Smith that is wonderfully reminiscent of the original film. There are spots within MIB3 in which the novelty of Brolin being Jones working with Smith takes precedence over the plot but I found myself more than willing to accept this dynamic. Beyond Brolin, though, MIB3 is littered with strong supporting work from Will Arnett (brief but great), Bill Hader (whose appearance marks a strong turning point for the film), and most importantly Michael Stuhlbarg who steals every single scene in which he participates. Given his work here and his small role in last year's Hugo (one of my ten favorite performances of the year), Stuhlbarg is becoming one of my very favorite character actors in Hollywood today. <br/><br/>It isn't always the smoothest ride and some of the jokes fall flat (though perhaps that's more a sign of my matured sensibilities) but the blend of action, comedy, and surprisingly good sci-fi makes MIB3 a solid, worthwhile film. Add in a thoroughly unexpected touching moment of genuine heart and it's even enough to make on forget Men in Black 2 ever happened, a sentiment I think we can all get behind.<br/><br/>Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com"

","You know me, and know how little i liked Will Smith's few last films, if you read my reviews; i was annoyed by Happiness, didn't like much of anything else he did since, especially the serious stuff. On the other hand i quite like Tommy Lee Jones, though i wouldn't classify him as a ""first grade actor""; also, i found MIB 2 quite lacking compared to the first, which wasn't perfect, but it was OK as a funny, spoofy movie and a good watch for Saturday night.. but MIB3 is excellent.<br/><br/>No, i'm not gonna spoil the plot, there's no reason to. The story is not so important as to warrant a review; but the acting is very, very entertaining. <br/><br/>MIB3 concentrates primarily on Will Smith, with TLJ being more of a supporting character than anything; Smith gives here a great performance, not simply as a comedy actor, but also in some (don't be scared now) touching, heart-felt moments (not talking about the cheesy ending, if you've seen it already).<br/><br/>I have had the distinct feeling while watching this that MIB3 takes more than one lesson from many of the latest Disney animated comedies, such as Ice Age, Monsters Inc, etc .. to sneak in to our belly-laugh comedy films a few tricky feel-good, family-friendly moments, and the occasional very thin bit of adult humour (""O??"").<br/><br/>But here is the thing: i hate feel good; it positively makes me puke, i'm the tough-as-nails wannabe who loves a good mutilation and bloodshed, possibly with revenge, and i would neeeever recommend a feel-good film. But MIB3. <br/><br/>Oh this film is just sweet; maybe i just wanted Will Smith to not suck so bad anymore, but man did i get my wish - he's in top shape and this is his best film yet.<br/><br/>And again, it's not just him, Josh Brolin (no idea who he is, had to look him up) is good in his role, the direction and pacing of the film is flawless, (ok, maybe the ending was a bit rushed, but hey, it's still Hollywood), the production is stellar (hmm.. Hollywood), soundtrack could have been better, but MIB3 is a film i can wholeheartedly recommend to *everyone* - young couples, girls, my mum, my flatmates, all my nerd friends, internet trolls, it's just so ... so.. <br/><br/>OK so, it's not perfect. But it's good. Enough with the compliments, go watch it already (not in 3d .. )<br/><br/>Final vote: 8/10 - no reason not to watch it."

"aesgaard41","10","4","9","3 April 2013"," MIB3 Rocks Your Mind
","I've seen the first two MIB movies; they're both excellent movies merging both action and science fiction genres with some absurdist comedy, and this third installment not only follows then with the same formula, it pole-vaults with it. First off, it's lacking Rip Torn as Zed and Frank the Pug, but their presence and legacy is still inherent in the film. A villain named Boris the Animal escapes prison on the moon with the sole purpose of taking out the man who put him there, namely Kay, but instead of the traditional vengeance plot, Boris goes back in time to stop Kay from putting him in prison in the first place. Here's where it gets sticky, somehow, Jay is the only one who knows time has been altered. In a true time travel story, Boris should have vanished into the past never to be seen again. After all, time is immutable; it can't be changed. Just as there should have been two aliens named Boris in the diverging time line, there would be another Jay in the alternate time line that Boris creates instead of Jay just experiencing a time-rip. (Can you say ""plot device,"" boys and girls? I knew you could.) While a bit of accuracy would be nice, it's a small blooper in what is actually a top-notch plot. Will Smith is in top form, picking up Jay's character with ease, as does sardonic Tommy Lee Jones. Josh Brolin really pulls off an excellent temporal version of Kay in the 60s, and Emma Thompson shines as their new boss. Alice Eve is stunning as usual, but she really doesn't get much to do, and Jemaine Clement gives something to the villain that the first two movie villains didn't have, a presence and a character. Will Arnett also manages a rather brief comic cameo in one of the best gags in the movie. Definitely the best film in the series, probably because the film manages to link both Jay and Kay's pasts in a way even I didn't see coming, this is the one we've been waiting for."

"jeffreypgibson","1","4","9","8 September 2012"," Why was this green-lit?
","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Dialogue is repeated due to lazy writing. 'Funny' moments are always awkward and never funny. Action- packed moments are filled with paper-thin CG. Tommy Lee Jones is utterly under-utilized, his part in the film is essentially a cameo. Emma Thompson's part has the same problem. Josh Brolin delivers a good performance as always, but there's only so much you can do with a poorly- written character. The story is as ridiculous as it is contrived, and while that was one of the great things about MIB (the original), surprising your audience with a story so insane it's simply fun only works once; you can't repeat that practice and expect good results. I'll always be glad I didn't waste money on this in theaters and simply end by saying, 'what a piece of crap.'"

Boris the Animal is not much of a villain, basically something out of a bad biker movie. When you consider they had unlimited universes of reptiles and bugs, and who knows what, to choose from seems like there were better options.<br/><br/>It's not an awful movie but they had the talent and budget to do much better. It's OK at an early bird price, but there is little reason to pay a 3D up-charge."
"Chris_Pandolfi","7","4","9","25 May 2012"," It's Only a Matter of Time
","Time travel movies are so difficult to get right. If they're taken too seriously, the plot tends to get bogged down by confusing and abstract theoretical concepts, which often times fail to fully explain how and why certain things could have happened. If they're not taken seriously enough, the story can fall victim to the impulsive and preposterous whims of the filmmakers. Barry Sonnenfeld's ""Men in Black 3"" tells a time travel story that successfully finds a healthy balance between science fiction and fantasy. Even with some gaps in logic – which is understandable given the fact that time is barely understood by scientists, let alone by filmmakers – it operates under a comprehensible and fairly plausible set of rules. All the while, it never loses sight of the fact that it was made solely for entertainment.<br/><br/>It has been fifteen years since the start of the franchise and ten years since the last film was released. Given that stretch of time, it's only natural that ""Men in Black 3"" would showcase new high-tech gadgets and more elaborate special effects, to say absolutely nothing of the fact that it's presented in 3D. What's unexpected is that fewer aliens are featured. But unexpected doesn't necessarily mean unwelcome; what the film lacks in delightfully bizarre creature effects is made up for with a plot that's fun, clever, and surprisingly character driven. We learn more about Agents J and K in this one film than we did in the first two combined. The reward is twofold; not only is the depth of character greater than it ever has been, the humor is also more plentiful and more meaningful. It's always better to laugh with someone we've gotten to know, even if only to the smallest degree.<br/><br/>Since the events of ""Men in Black II,"" Rip Torn's character, Agent Zed, has died. If you look at the holographic tablet at his memorial service, you'll immediately notice that his birth year was 19XX. His successor is the stiffly British Agent O (Emma Thompson). The aging Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has somehow managed to become even more humorless. Out of a combination of concern and annoyance, his MIB partner of fifteen years, Agent J (Will Smith), urges him to open up. ""How did you end up this way?"" he asks. ""Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to,"" K replies coldly. As this is being established, we learn that our moon is home to an intergalactic prison; after forty years of being locked away in shackles, a ruthless one-armed alien named Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes, intent on taking his revenge against Agent K, the man who arrested him.<br/><br/>When the MIB become aware of Boris' presence in New York, J discovers that, despite his status and pay grade, there are a number of classified files he's not privy to, such as K's confrontation with Boris at Cape Canaveral in July of 1969. One morning, he awakens with a splitting headache and a curious craving for chocolate milk. He goes to K's apartment; not only is he not there, a woman and several children seem to have moved in. J goes to MIB headquarters, only to discover that the agents have never heard of anyone named K. The exception is O, who tells J that K died over forty years ago. O notices J's need for chocolate milk and deduces that he has been affected by a rip in the space-time continuum. It seems that Boris has gotten hold of an illegal time travelling device, gone back into the past, and killed Agent K. J must now go back himself, not only to save K's life but also to save Earth from an invasion that never should have taken place.<br/><br/>And so, armed with a black market time travel device, J jumps off of the Chrysler Building and into the past. It's now July 15, 1969. Although the rules of time travel dictate that there be no personal contact or sharing of information, J teams up with a twenty-nine-year-old Agent K (Josh Brolin), who's just as dedicated to his job but is far more agreeable to be around. Clearly, whatever made him to dour hasn't happened yet. They join forces with an inter-dimensional being known as Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg), who has the ability to see every possible future happening simultaneously. Childlike without being reduced to a mentally challenged stereotype, he's quite possibly the best character of the entire ""Men in Black"" franchise.<br/><br/>The plot is actually more complex and engaging than my description is making it seem. There are certain scenes that are best viewed without the aid of my review, most notably when J and young K pay a visit to Andy Warhol at The Factory. ""Men in Black 3"" is a fun and visually spectacular movie, the latter having more to do with art direction, set design, lighting, and CGI than with its use of 3D. However, the real high points of the movie are the scenes featuring Josh Brolin. He captures the vocal inflections and mannerisms of Tommy Lee Jones with astonishing accuracy. Watching him, I thought back to the year 2008 and wondered why he received an Oscar nomination for ""Milk"" rather than for ""W."" You cannot convince me any living actor could have better and more thoroughly embodied the spirit of George W. Bush. His talent for mimicry is undervalued, I believe.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

"adhipar","4","3","6","8 July 2012"," No K hence should be No J
","I need to let it out of my chest. J was recruited by K so if K is not around then J should not be an MIB agent. This is a big plot hole and happen in the beginning which I find hard to accept it along the way. It's kind of ruining the movie for me.<br/><br/>Actually the solution for this enormous hole is easy, just get another agent like agent O, hires J again, since her colleague (K) ask her to keep an eye on him - for the reason explained in the end of the movie.<br/><br/>So, in my alternate script, the next day after the disappearing of K, J in his black tuxedo (explain later that at that time he's a cop just having dinner with GF or any other reason why he wear a black tuxedo - so we the audiences think that he's an MIB agent) is hunting down a guy (similar scenes to MIB 1 but of course more spectacular) which then turns out an alien, but J feels it's like a deja vu, then when agent O recruited him (like K did in 1st installment) and somehow mentioning how she were monitoring him as requested by K (which make us, the audience more curious about what happen), J has this urge to dig out about who is K and what happen to him since K feels very familiar/close. He's digging his way around - of course in a bad way - until he finds that timekeeper guy, who explain what might happen and then J decided to do the time jump, and we go back to the original script.<br/><br/>However, although Josh Brolin's act as younger K is superb, the story/script is not getting better (do I have to make another alternate script?) since what we see is this 2 agent hunting a criminal with minimum twist. They didn't make their way by trashing the alien community in the 60s upside down to find Boris. I think a lot of audience including me are expecting J to make some serious mess.<br/><br/>Instead they find a super mentalist alien who tell them everything they need to know and help them get to the place they need to be. It's like watching the Mentalist TV series or Twilight and not the good episode one.<br/><br/>So 4/10 from me, better watch it at home."

I think it was great to learn all about Kay this time, and find out why he is his sinister self, and it brings back your love for all the characters.<br/><br/>I thought the VFX were particularly good, which gave this film more aesthetically pleasing look compared to the previous ones which obviously, technology has advance to help them improve. I personally don't have any faults with it, though i think maybe i would pick up on something when i see it again, but the non stop action of it just, for me, keeps you engaged so well, that if there are any slip ups or faults, you don't really see it straight away. I feel that this film, was particularly great in 3D. Sometimes i feel films don't need 3D like Harry Potter was just pointless ""oh that tree is moving"" but for this i thought it really made the viewing experience better and brought the feeling you should get, that you're about to get a spike through your face! Although i was surprised that it was a PG, but i guess with the alien fiction nature its fine!<br/><br/>A Great family film, and a very good revival!"
"kepi78","3","5","13","28 May 2012"," No spoiler, but this movie was not too good.
","Let me start by saying, I had low expectations for this movie and the movie turned out to be worse than I expected. First thing first JOSH BROLIN did a Phenomenal Job as a young K, PHENOMENAL!!! Will Smith, I am a fan, but you failed to provide the comedic relief in this one. I will not lie, yes I did laugh, but for the most of it, the only jokes I really found to be actually funny made most moviegoers at our showing(white audience) cringe due to the racial nature and historical facts of most of the punch lines. While I have definitely seen worse, what upsets me the most about this movie is that we supported putting this movie ahead of THE AVENGERS!!!!!! The Avengers was an AWESOME movie from the corny jokes to the story, action, acting, everything about the Avengers was great.<br/><br/>I do appreciate how MIBIII attempted to fill the holes in time traveling deaths, but at the end of the day, they failed at that as well. Put it this way, if you're over the age of 10, turn your brain off and enjoy because even my 11 year old twins were left unsatisfied by this film."
"Astralan","9","5","13","25 May 2012"," Much better than expected.
","I was watching various site ratings on this film since the beginning of the week wondering how it would be received by the critical movie base, and was surprised when it jumped from 40 to 140 reviews that were positive. I did not read them, but it did change my mind about going to see it, and I must admit it certainly helped the franchise dig out of the rut it was in when MIB 2 came out. What a flop that was! That one is NOT in my movie collection.<br/><br/>I have to preface this with the usual movie experience. I have stated previously that I am not a huge fan of 3D... most of them remind me of those halo-postcards and knee deep in lackluster. So I bought tickets to the 2D showing. Entering the theater, the sound was that of previews but there was nothing on the screen. Sat down and munched some popcorn and waited. Every now and then there was a flash of light but eventually, one by one, people left the audience to complain. I would normally do this, but seeing the amount of people who left I felt my complaint would have been useless. At last I heard someone down the hall say ""The projector has a burnt out bulb and will take about 10 minutes to replace. For those that would like not to wait, we will let you into the viewing of the 3D showing and give you all the glasses at no charge"". Looks like I would be seeing this in 3D anyways, and as I suspected... putting on the glasses really made things less clear and darker.<br/><br/>To start off, there was a real familiarity for the movie. It was all comfortable. Characters we knew; aliens we were familiar with; even the look and feel of the camera and music was all Men In Black (which Bill Pope, from Matrix trilogy, Spiderman fame, Steven Spielberg and Danny Elfman from the original movie), the story started out with new character development that made this sequel at home. Yes, the characters have aged... almost to the point where you want to say ""ENOUGH! PLEASE RETIRE OR DO SOMETHING MORE YOUR AGE"". It is OK though, the movie was crafted around the character ages... cept maybe Will Smith needs to move on from action films. The movie makes it plain that it was already many years since their last screen presentation. It is believable in the fiction it is portrayed in. The wit was there. The characters where there. And the plot was there, so lets continue with the fun.<br/><br/>Yes, K and J have gone on in their years. Yes, they keep aliens in their place but it is obvious that there is (as with all convicted criminals, galactic or native) some criminals can not just let things go by without payback. If I say ""time travel"", I would be giving away a lot, but we have seen time travel before and it is not new. Star Trek, Time Machine, yadda yadda have all played with this and most times messing around with timelines and parallel dimensions is never a safe thing unless you have really nothing to loose. Right? I mean, what does a criminal have to loose that will never have parole? Specially if that alien lives for enormous lifespans? It gets messy, needless to say, and life as we know it once again becomes a key pin the the events that follow in this movie.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin play a young Kay, and he sure did a good study on Tommy Lee's character even down to the inflections of the voice. It was entertaining. Young Kay was more human, sociable and open than his elder counterpart. What happens to make the older Kay and the younger Kay is really what this movie is about. I didn't find the FX all that new. Actually, I felt the 3D portage was lacking and not necessary. I wish I could have seen it in 2D to be honest. With all the banter, action and blocking, this sequel plays more along its original roots as the first movie than the second, plus you will be smiling when you come to the ending scenes. It makes all the difference in the world.<br/><br/>I'm glad there were no kids in the audience, but it is tamer than most scifi flicks. You really should plan this viewing as an adult tho, it leaves you free to enjoy it as it should. B"

","I am terribly disappointed in this movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I did like the first two ones - the first movie is a classic! Now, in the third installment of the series, the whole movie seems like a very hasty product of an idle mind. The very first thing that you notice is that the main actors seem very tired and dull. Will Smith, otherwise being a very funny and classic character, seems now burnt out with his red eyes and gawky acting. Tommy Lee is - like he should - very much expressionless. It's part of his style and the style of the movie, but this time it just seems like a worn-out joke.<br/><br/>The story is uninteresting and the plot is full of illogicalities. I'm not questioning time travel in itself, but how it turns out is very unrealistic. The whole thing with J being the only one who remembers K is just a big facepalm, and the time ""jump"" ... Sigh, the plot is from a children's cartoon! There are far too many stupid things in the movie to list, here.<br/><br/>The musical score and the general sound landscape is almost nonexistent. There are no nice melodies or songs that would support the movie. When the two agents are sitting in a car, the car makes no sound whatsoever. Also, the CGI could be much better. (If you don't agree, check out the part where the J and the large fish are fighting - looks like an animation from the 90's.) I don't have anything positive to say about this movie. The plot is bad, the acting is bad, music is bad ... It was a waste of time to watch this movie and I got depressed after seeing it, thinking how bad the ""art"" of today has become. Maybe I want to join the aliens on a distant planet, because this planet is (almost) full of disposable stupidity."

","Specifically this movie is crap, and I as the reviewer should not try to link it to the human condition (insane, we are all insane). If I center my review solely to the movie, I'll be less likely to go off on a tangent. This movie and this movie alone fails for it's own personal reasons, the way other movies fail is irrelevant to Men In Black 3's way of failing. For instance this movie chose substandard writing and plot to try to make it successful. Also egomania is an actual disease, narcissism is a mental disorder, now when I watch Will Smith movies all I see is someone who is very probably mentally ill. It's weird for me. I think, shouldn't someone help him he's obviously sick, but Will Smith is a Hollywood superstar, he's made a fortune being sick. He does not want to get help. Can I say I'm any better?"

The magic or pull of this movie franchise is the great chemistry between Will and Tommy; so why take Tommy away? It wont work even if you try to substitute it for a younger and different actor of Tommy. Yes I know this movie cost a lot to make already, but you ought to spend the $$$ digitizing the original Tommy to look younger. 'Benjamin Button' Tommy so to speak. But no. Lets try hiring a younger actor. And what happens?

"stevenball2","5","3","7","2 June 2012"," Jay and Kay Together Again
","Everyone is making such a big deal over Josh Brolin. He is good but it is Will Smith who carries the movie. He is in almost every scene. Adam Sandler take note: Will Smith has more facial expressions in one scene than you have shown in your entire ""body of work"". Plus he can do drama too. What this movie is lacking is a credible villain (Boris doesn't quite cut it) a credible sidekick (Griffin is very disappointing) & hot chicks (sorry Emma Thompson). The first 2 MIB had Linda Fiorentino & Lara Flynn Boyle who were hot. This episode also lacks Rip Torn, Frank the Pug & funny cameos like Michael Jackson, Martha Stewart & Peter Graves. What does this movie have? A boring time travel story to the '60's of all places. Bill Hader who is usually funny is NOT funny as Andy Warhol. You also have the ""Luke I am your father"" sub plot. Totally unnecessary. In short while the special effects are OK the movie is just NOT funny. I hate to say it but not only is it NOT funny but it is boring too."
"kgprophet","6","3","7","26 May 2012"," ""It's Gotta Have Heart""
","This phrase is a cliché refrain a producer says when someone is pitching a screenplay. All those explosions and special effects mean nothing if we don't care about the main characters. Another issue, a very skeptical moviegoer is not interested in yet another space alien invasion movie unless it has something new to offer. One thing most people agree is that MIB3 should not look like the previous sequels. Reminiscent of another dormant franchise - Indiana Jones - were Agent J & K going to put their suits back on and fight another monster? It kind of starts that way, introducing a fairly engaging villain, but then surprises the summer movie-going audience by turning all touchy-feely. Will Smith, having honed his chops on the sitcom stage, is excellent with body language and cutesy reactions. So pleasantly enough we are taken down a different path, a path that still delivers the actions and effects. But thankfully de-emphasises all those side monster characters. The filmmakers were smart enough (especially the editor) to not fill it full of monster gags at the main MIB terminal like previous films. Not once do you feel ""Been there, done that"". Instead we meet one new fresh alien that has the ability to predict the future. This character almost feels like ""Rain Man"" and practically steals the show. So kudos to the filmmakers for steering their way into a script ""with heart"". This includes an engaging Emma Thompson as the next head of MIB, who oddly only appears briefly in this film.<br/><br/>But Tommy Lee Jones should start thinking about retirement. Frankly it was hard to look at his aged face, and felt that even if agent K was a real career man he would've retired by now (wait didn't he?). My enthusiasm before going to see this movie was lukewarm, who was asking for another MIB sequel? And where the heck has Will Smith been anyway? The primary motivation was to see Josh Brolin, who worked with Jones in ""No Country For Old Men"". Brolin personifies Jones with lethal accuracy. Little did I know that the filmmakers had us the audience in mind and kept the story clicking along, while stopping along the way to have some pie. Good dialogue (rare), good villain, so is the third act any good? Turns out this film has the opposite problem that most weak stories have, it has a strong 3rd act, while starting with a relatively weak 1st act. One thing I am sick and tired of is a tentpole film that feels obligated to go into extra innings, and go over-the-top with the final action setpiece, where a series of objectives need to be accomplished in order to get to ""The End"" and we can all go home. MIB3, a comedy of sorts, follows the golden rule of comedy movies - keep the running time around 90 minutes. Any comedy that runs closer to 2 hours loses it's punch. MIB3 runs around 100 minutes, sparing us the obligatory drawn out finale action set piece. Although there is a prescribed resolution at the Apollo launch, it focuses on the character arcs, and provides a heart tug at the end in an unexpected way. Something that no tentpole film has done in a long time.<br/><br/>With that successful examination of characters, this can be accepted as a worthy entry in the MIB franchise, and puts to shame other older franchises that have recently been dusted off. Let's hope that MIB franchise retires with dignity as well."
"kalpittandon","5","3","7","26 May 2012"," Movie Review : Men in Black III
","It has been a decade since the guys in black dazzled the cinema goers with slick action, dizzying aliens and tongue in cheek comedy. It was indeed fascinating to see whether the director, Barry Sonnenfeld with the same crew but a débutant screenwriter, Lowell Cunningham will be able to reignite a dormant franchise and make the cash counter running by delivering a blockbuster.<br/><br/>Agent J (Will Smith) and agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) have been together since last 15 years. They account for the safety of our planet, throws in slapstick humor against each other and take care of the extraterrestrial activities happening in our realm. When a long lost enemy, Boris the Animal, played eccentrically by Jemaine Clement, goes back in time to kill Agent K, Agent J decides to take a trip down the same lane and stop the inevitable.<br/><br/>The obsessively detailed aliens, enormous set pieces, spectacular action sequences and the eye popping 3D, the director and our duo has scored a home run. But the most enthralling of all the achievements is the balance between the technical aspects and the human heart. The two veterans shine with an electrifying chemistry all the way and are in top form.<br/><br/>Where the movie falters is in its script. It leaves the viewer with a been-there-done-that kind of feeling. It never justifies its existence. It definitely is better than the limp sequel, MIB II (2002), but does not quite match up to the heights of the very first outing. A bit more creative climax would definitely have given more juice to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Men in Black III works in parts. It will keep your popcorns churning, but will leave you wanting for more. And when the curtains go down, you definitely won't require neutralizing your memory. It deserves a watch!<br/><br/>Rating- 3/5"

How come J (Will Smith) still remembered him, or even worked for MiB since it was K that recruited him post death.

"TheMovieDiorama","6","2","4","25 February 2018"," Men In Black 3 is a much deserved sequel although doesn't quite reach the heights of the original.
","Let's face it, anything could've been better than 'Men In Black 2' in what is quite possibly one of the most boring sequels ever. A franchise hiatus and our beloved secret agents are back in another entertaining sci-fi adventure. Boris The Animal has escaped from a lunar prison and wants to take revenge on Agent K. What better way to do it than to erase him from time itself. However, Agent J still remembers him and must go back in time to save Agent K and the world from an alien invasion. Automatically have to deduct a point just for the use of time travel and not addressing paradoxical elements. It's a lazy uninspired gimmick and is only used decently in a quarter of good sci-fi flicks. In saying that, the 'Men in Black' aesthetic appeal still remains. It's as if this sequel was made in the 90's and I appreciated the need for continuity. It wasn't overly dark and depressing, t'was a light fun romp that everyone in the family can enjoy. But, that's all it is. Don't go into this wanting to be blown away by another revolutionary plot, it is something we have seen numerous times in the past. The narrative was good, very well paced. Several occasions of going to point A to B to C etc. which introduces an array of humorous characters like an undercover Andy Warhol. Boris The Animal was a memorable antagonist who literally could've decimated Agent K and J easily. Seriously. He kills everyone else with ease. But I suppose we wouldn't have ourselves a feature film then. Tommy Lee Jones needed far more screen time. Will Smith was Will Smith. The stand out, and most revelatory casting choice in years, is Josh Brolin as a young Agent K. He got Jones' mannerisms down to perfection. Thoroughly enjoyed his performance. Dare I say I wanted to see more of Scherzinger as well? The visual effects were fine, the human CGI has dated pretty badly but on the whole it is watchable. A good and enjoyable sequel, that for some reason addresses racial stereotypes...!"

","I couldn't give this one more than a 5...while the original MIB was brilliant in its imagination and presentation, MIB3 felt smaller by contrast. MIB2 was much more fun also, but the story behind this outing just didn't hold together. Both Will Smith and Tommy Lee looked like ""What am I doing here, and their performances showed it.The CGI was pretty good, but thrown together to take your mind off the meager story line. Let's face it, somebody decided, 'hey, let's make a third MIB but not too juicy..."". I mean, is there some rule that says sequels must degenerate in quality. Other than the CGI, so much was lacking that I lost interest rather fast, and that doesn't happen that often to me."

The special effects are all good. I had previously rated this at 7 stars, but upgraded it this time to 9. Josh Brolin did a great job as the young Kay and Tommy Lee Jones as always came through with an excellent performance. Will Smith carries the movie, of course, doing Jay at his best. Don't believe any of the negative reviews (professional reviewers or others on IMDb). Make up your own mind about this one, and keep an open mind about time travel and all of its problems.

"Floated2","6","2","4","23 December 2013"," Outdated but a Decent watch
","Not being a fan of the Men in Black franchise and finding the third film to being a slightly unnecessary addition to the franchise, my expectations were average. Men In Black 3 was basically what was expected. Some laughs, good use of special effects, decent action and a solid plot. I think more could have happened (especially towards the end) but it was okay. It has also been a while since I have watched the first two films of the franchise, seeing as my memory wasn't the best from watching MIB3.<br/><br/>When Men in Black 3 was rumored to come out, I wondered why it took so long and why they bothered bringing the franchise back (save for the money). However everything seemed to be in place and the actors played their parts as if the franchise hasn't been off for a decade.<br/><br/>I didn't care too much for the villain of Doris the animal too bad as I think it could had been more interesting. Time travel in sci-fi films is always a positive as it was well done here. The chemistry between Will Smith and Josh Brolin was great here. <br/><br/>The supporting characters were neatly done. Along the way, Smith and Brolin seek Griffin (a mysterious man that is able to see in the future and eventually guides them as their journey goes on). Griffin was great as we stole many scenes he was in. Overall Men in Black 3 is solid but nothing too special as I and others should revise the first two films from the franchise."
"g-bodyl","9","2","4","21 December 2013"," Welcome Back, Men In Black!
","Now it seems like I am one of the few whom actually enjoyed the second installment in this franchise when it came out a decade ago, so I was looking forward to this film. Even though no one in particular was asking for Men in Black 3, it's nice to welcome them with open arms. This film has all the elements that made the first film so genius. It has the duo of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, great, offbeat creature designs, some wise humor, and a villain who is not only menacing, but has some punch lines.<br/><br/>Barry Sonnenfeld returns at the directing helm and he directs a film in a franchise that put him on the map. Agents K and J return and J has to travel to the past where he must prevent the younger K from being murdered.<br/><br/>I'm glad both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones returned because it's not Men in Black without them. They still have excellent chemistry and I still love how Agent J gets to poke fun at Agent K's non-changing demeanor. However, I have to mention Josh Brolin. His portrayal of younger K is uncanny. I felt like he was actually Tommy Lee Jones for a second. Jermaine Clement makes a convincing and pretty scary villain.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great welcome back to our Men in Black. As critics pointed out, this film largely improves on it's predecessor. It also helps there are several emotional moments that give us some clues on the younger days of J and K. I really liked this movie thanks to great acting, a good story, and something just to keep my childhood fresh. I rate this film 9/10."
"MaximumMadness","7","2","4","7 December 2013"," A shocking return to form after the sub-par second film, ""Men in Black 3"" is a fast, fun, quirky film and a surprisingly good sequel.
","I remember back in 2002, after ""Men in Black II"" came out, there was chatter about a third film. And I was excited to see a third film, even though the second was a poorly-written, under-developed cash-grab that felt as though it was without identity. I was just too addicted to the chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, and I loved the world that director Barry Sonnenfeld had helped create in the first two entries.<br/><br/>But as time went on, it seemed less and less likely. Sure, we'd hear a tidbit of news here, or a rumor there... But it was never anything substantial. After about five years, I gave up all hope that a third film would even happen. So you can imagine my surprise when this film was finally released in 2012, about 10 years after the prior entry.<br/><br/>And you can also imagine my surprise that despite the second film being... well, pretty bad, this one was actually a very shocking and surprising return to form, and is actually a pretty strong and generally well-told sequel.<br/><br/>Smith and Jones return as agents J and K, now having known each other for about 14 years. They have their usual tension and banter, but J is starting to notice some odd things about K, and wonders what made him the way he is. However, this is put on hold when a ruthless alien villain called Boris ""The Animal"" (Jemaine Clement) escapes from prison and uses a time traveling device to go back in time and murder a younger Agent K. J, somehow being one of the only people to remember who who K even was, is forced to follow Boris back to 1969 and stop him from killing a younger Agent K (Josh Brolin). J and the young K must also work together to stop Boris's other dastardly plans for the future in the process.<br/><br/>The acting is a lot better this time around. Particularly in terms of the chemistry between Smith and Jones, which I felt was somewhat muted by the poor writing in the prior film. Their banter and dialog is almost as good as it was in the original, and both actors are great not only together, but on their own as well. Josh Brolin is also a bit of a revelation as the young K, who appears on-screen far more than the older, modern K. Brolin isn't just doing a Tommy Lee Jones impression, he's doing something different, since K was a different man in 1969. It's interesting to see how K evolves and changes over the course of the film due to what happens, and we can see how he will eventually become the man we first see in the original. Brolin just nailed it perfectly.<br/><br/>The villain portrayed by Clement is also a lot of fun, and he has some great moments of not only comedy, but of intimidation and creepiness. (Although I will admit he's not a deep character and is borderline one- dimensional, I can forgive it because at least he wasn't terribly written as... certain other villains from a certain other ""Men in Black"" sequel were) And Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, a 5th dimensional being who is able to see all possible outcomes of all situations at once in the past, present and future is a LOT of fun. He's a major supporting character, and both his child-like glee and his darkness in being such an all-seeing character are both well played. He's almost the heart of the film.<br/><br/>The production is a lot of fun, especially with the time-travel plot, which gives us two radically different visual aesthetics. The set, costume and of course Rick Baker's alien designs are fantastic in both time-lines. I particularly enjoyed how Baker and his team made the aliens in the 1969 New York look more like aliens from cheesy, old- school Sci-Fi flicks from that era as opposed to the more modern and intricate designs of characters from the modern day sequences.<br/><br/>Sonnenfeld's direction is a lot more fluid and fun in this film. (Again, as opposed to the second... I really hate to keep comparing this film to the second, but it's hard not to when this is so much better) And the script written by Etan Cohen is funny, tightly-paced and has some unexpected and truly heartfelt moments that may in fact bring a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>This film does lose a few points, however, in that some of its jokes are very hit and miss, and a few plot-related issues. In particular with the time-travel approach. I did notice many inconsistencies and changes to the ""rules"" of time travel throughout. And it did bug me quite a bit. However, not enough to ruin the film.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws, this is still a very solid, well-made sequel and is a definite return to form for the series. And it has re-ignited that ""Men in Black"" fire, and left me hoping for a potential fourth film.<br/><br/>I give ""Men in Black 3"" a pretty good 7 out of 10."

The whole chocolate milk thing being an indicator for a fracture in the space-time continuum was out there and very neat. <br/><br/>Heck traveling back in time and seeing MIB in the 60's was good, and Brolin nailed it as a young Tommy Lee Jones. <br/><br/>Then along comes the 2nd half of the movie, that just feels SO rushed...The reveal of the mystery behind what K wasn't telling J was really handled poorly. That should have had more of an impact... Heck the whole bit at Cape Kennedy was just a real rushed finale with plenty of issues, and the father bit was really weak (not that it existed, but how he died.) <br/><br/>Boris started off as the most interesting MIB villain, but by the end he was a sideshow. <br/><br/>Once again, i walk away from one of these movies feeling ""meh"" about it. <br/><br/>I do not understand why they are so popular."

","I loved Men in Black, Men in Black II was okay but not as good. My brother-in-law was wrong about Men in Black 3. He didn't like it. He didn't like the fact that Tommy Lee Jones was not in it except in the beginning and end. I loved the aliens from the previous two movies but I really enjoyed the strong story line in this one. I love the vision of the 1960's - jet packs, awesome motorcycles and a gigantic neuralizer. Josh Brolin was a perfect young K - chemistry wise, voice, mannerisms, etc. The humor was wonderful, sometimes with great subtly and sometimes in your face. I like Emma Thompson and liked seeing her this sci-fi humor role. It is well worth seeing, I think I want to add it to my collection."
"siderite","8","2","4","27 September 2012"," A worthy film in the franchise
","The first Men in Black was mostly a comedy. It set up the stage, presented the actors and managed to do a little extra on the side, but it was a proof of concept mostly, with many a laugh and lots of goofiness. The second movie had the setup, but it wasn't nearly as funny or active; it basically flopped.<br/><br/>The third movie saves the day. It solves the second movie by ignoring it completely and using the same story in a better way: Agent J gets to save K again. The film also ties things up nicely and puts the original film in perspective. The villain acts a bit goofy, but is very well designed and positively scary. Brolin does a great agent K. It seemed Tommy Lee Jones had to be heavily made up in order to appear remotely interesting and his role was minimal. Even better are the introductions of interesting people in the cast: Emma Thompson as a romantic interest of K's, Jemaine Clement of Flight and the Conchords fame as the bad alien (the humans are not dead yet, Jemaine!) and lovely Alice Eve in a too tiny a role as young Agent O (and may I say what a perfect operative nickname they found for her).<br/><br/>Bottom line: some people did not like it. I have no idea why. Probably it had to do with expectations that were set up 10 years ago and then took lives of their own. The script is subtle, but effective, the acting is good, the 1969 atmosphere is not really accurate, but it doesn't matter so much and there is real humour, not just weird aliens doing silly things. Will Smith was great in his first role in about 4 years. All in all, I liked the film."

MIB3 is such surreal that it actually succeeds in inducing a thought in the viewers' minds that Aliens do exist and MIB exists too.The special effects are good.

"paul_haakonsen","7","2","4","3 September 2012"," Surpassing the previous two movies...
","I will start out by saying that ""Men in Black 3"" is the best of the series so far, at least in my opinion. Why? Well simply because of the depths of the story, it is better planned and executed, and more enjoyable than the previous ones.<br/><br/>The story ""Men in Black 3"" is about Agent J traveling back in time to prevent an alien invasion of Earth and to prevent the assassination of his partner, Agent K.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous movies, the various aliens in all their strange appearances do not have that much of a prominent part of the movie. Sure they are there, but mostly as background characters. That is nice in itself, because there is still a large range of strange alien creatures to be seen, just in a less active role in the movie. The story in ""Men in Black 3"" is more character driven, with focus on Agents J and K in particular, and a single alien, Boris the Animal. This does work out quite nicely, because the story takes on a more personal aspect of storytelling, and there is a really, really great moment towards the end of the movie when you learn the truth about the two agents relationship. That was something that I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>Again, you have Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones returning to their roles, and then Josh Brolin really pulled off stepping into the shoes of portraying a younger version of Agent K. Boris the Animal was also nicely played by Jemaine Clement. And Emma Thompson stepping in as Agent O, new leader of the MIB agency after Zed having passed on.<br/><br/>And as with the previous two movies, the CGI effects in the movie were really great, and the aliens were realistic and believable. Which really is an important thing to make a movie like this enjoyable.<br/><br/>I found this to be the best of the series so far, because it is a more personal story where the multitude of strange alien creatures didn't have a huge part of the screen all the time. And the depths of the plot were well planned and executed, despite the minor flaws here and there (if you read through the 'Goofs' (here on IMDb), but that is really minor details that, I will admit that I didn't notice at all, you'd notice only if you are a, well, a nerd! No offense to anyone. But you really have to be a perfectionist to factual details to notice that, so hats off to those who pointed them out.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed ""Men in Black"" or ""Men in Black II"", then you definitely have to watch ""Men in Black 3"", because it adds a lot to the overall storyline of the MIB universe."

When Boris the Animal escapes from prison, Agent K decides to go in this mission alone but Agent J being Agent J decides to help and travels back in time to kill the Boris the Animal. As with most sequels it was alright but nothing compared to the original. The problem with sequels and prequels is that you already know a lot of the jokes or what the characters do. You know Agent J is the funny guy and that K is the serious one who J pokes fun at. At far as sequels go this movie was good, better then most and the back in time thing was neat.

"estherladi","7","2","4","29 July 2012"," Soooo much better than the 2nd one
","Okay guys I was like one year old when the first MIB movie came out, so it is a nostalgic movie of my childhood. I've seen it like a billion times when I was a little kid. And as I re-watched it years later, I still liked it. It had good lesson in the end, and it was hilarious. Generally I liked the second movie of the franchise as a child, but now its just...meh. It shouldn't have been made I think. So I had absolutely no great expectations for this one... BUT...<br/><br/>It has blown my mind away. It was funny, it was smart, it had good visuals, good acting a fair plot. Don't get me wrong. It's not a timeless classic. Just a good flick to watch if you have time for going to the cinema.<br/><br/>So because I'm such a nice girl, let's start with its flaws:<br/><br/>Oh my gosh Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are so old for this movie. I mean just look at them. Yet, I must confess, almost all the good jokes were delivered from this fact.<br/><br/>The bad guy. In fact I liked him, his looks the way he talked and all, but I felt that the writers of the film didn't give much thought into him.<br/><br/>Young Agent O. She irritated me, greatly. I just didn't what was her purpose in the movie, outside of being K's love interest. BTW did you noticed that K had a secret love interest in every movie. He played the old good cool professionist, yet he was like the Captain Kirk of the franchise, IMO of course.<br/><br/>So much about the flaws, let's see the cool stuff in MIB3:<br/><br/>The relationship between K and J. Oh I know that this is the most marketable stuff in the franchise and for a reason. Oh for heaven's sake I just can't get enough of these two.<br/><br/>The special effects. Of course they've improved since 1997 and all the new alien stuff works for advantage of the movie. Oh BTW the way J traveled in time was so awesome and creative I can't even tell.<br/><br/>The sentiment and lesson in the end. Nice, makes you feel good after you walk out of the theater. This is simply what you can expect from a summer comedy. And in my opinion it wasn't corny or cheesy, just nice and fine the way it was.<br/><br/>It. Was. Hilarious. I have laughed all through the movie. And that's the most you should expect from a comedy. (IMO, again)<br/><br/>The acting. Oh Tommy ol' ol' Tommy, you were genial. You know what we want from Agent K and you give it to us. Will Smith did what he could I guess. But that 3 and a half year which he has skipped in acting didn't work at his best. Josh Brolin did just well as young Agent K. Gosh, he was cute.<br/><br/>The bad guy. I know I've already listed him under the Negative List, but he was cool and funny. His looks were creative, and Jemaine Clement was very good at this role. Though I could barely recognize him.<br/><br/>So. That's all folks. If you like the franchise you'll certainly like this, and if don't, well, you'll still have a good time watching it. Worth you're money. Worth a watch. Trust me."

","Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back and it is just as good as the first and second one. Will Smith comes back and is even more cool. Josh Brolin fits unbelievably into the young role of agent K, Josh plays the role so well with the same facial movements (or lack of in this case)he plays the same voice its as if tommy lee Jones actually acted it twenty years ago. The special effects continue to be amazing with fantastically real aliens and fight scenes with aliens. MIB 3 continues to be hilarious and interesting. The story is compelling and gripping, you will be drawn in by the detail for example early on agent K says 'don't talk about your father like that' or something similar and at first thinking this is just K being like a father figure to J and sort of teaching him however then you start to think this is important which later leads to a brilliant finale to the film being very sad and happy to realise J's past. This film will have you laughing, almost crying and intensely interested, one word EPIC!!"
"sofianck789","7","2","4","7 June 2012"," Agent Jay goes on a mission to save the world once more.
","The Men in Black, one of the most timeless movies in science fiction, has returned. Now more than ever it has come with an inexplicably assorted cast of Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Emma Thompson in futuristic garb, fighting for earth once more. The trilogy dates back to 1997 with original characters Agent Jay (Will Smith) and Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) defending mankind from extraterrestrial forces, under the cloak of black Ray Bans, humor, and an excessive amount of artillery. In this conclusion of the Men in Black trilogy, Agent Jay gets caught in a web of events and secrets that leads him to time jump (quite literally) to 1969 to try and kill a grotesque Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement)—whose overwhelmingly unpleasant face could easily dole out nightmares—and save the earth once more from alien invasion. <br/><br/>Within the first ten minutes, as well as throughout the movie, you can see the amount of special effects, laughs, chemistry of actors, and imagination engineered to make this movie live up to its legendary expectations. The most entertaining parts of the movie, however, were skin-deep (in this case probably horrendous, multi-colored alien skin): costume and makeup. Men in Black has had an impermeable reputation for creating some of the most odd and horrifying creatures in the past and third movie has only highlighted this, upstaging its predecessors. From Boris the Animal's monster-like complexion, the ""gold fish from the bags at the school fair"" at Mr. Wu's, and the jellyfish-blimp creatures topping off the skyscrapers of New York City for dessert, it looks as though all extra firearms will be put to good use. Costumes were also of good taste when Agent Jay rolls onto the streets of 1969 New York with hippies strolling around, with funny references to racism and famous people like Andy Warhol throughout. <br/><br/>And what better context to set all of this in than the wide cityscape of New York City, a jail on the moon, and space? Use of all these familiar monuments (ex. Empire State building) and secret government organizations almost made me question the existence of aliens. Almost. The background music of the movie, with never-ending variations of the theme song, only made the mood more reminiscent of a James Bond high speed chase: sleek and intriguing with the occasional, disturbing alien voice. Another intriguing aspect was the use of camera angles, especially when Agent Jay leaps off of the Empire State building. <br/><br/>All in all, seeing this movie made me feel like my seven-year- old self, in awe of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones for having excellent chemistry on screen and making me laugh almost every ten minutes. The whole movie was quite an experience—one definitely more enjoyable behind a pair of 3D glasses—although the romance between Agent K and Agent O seemed added in for the more mainstream viewers and mostly unnecessary. Appealing to most audiences, I believe Men in Black III deserves a wholesome seven stars for humor, special effects, acting, theme music/mood and an interesting use of Agent Kay doubles (who looked surprisingly similar to one another). Usually reluctant to watching most movie sequels, I was pleasantly surprised and found the third and last Men in Black is now my favorite and will recommend it to as many people as possible who enjoy a good laugh and plenty of alien guts."
"MC1-Bjornson","7","2","4","6 June 2012"," Back in Black Times Three
","""Men in Black 3"", Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Some Sexual Content, Violence, Mild Gore. Running Time: 1hr&46mns.<br/><br/>My Take *** (Out of ****) -or- On the IMDb Scale: 7/10 <br/><br/>After 16 years, we are still experiencing a particular Hollywood trend. I will call it ""The Big-Budget Will Smith Fantasy-Summer-Movie."" Sorry for coming up with such a long name for this trend, but it sure seems to ring true, doesn't it? Since 1996's ""Independence Day"", there have been many summers like what I just described. Back then, I did not realize Will Smith would have that kind of staying power. Here we are 15 years after the original ""Men in Black"" film hit multiplexes and Will Smith is still going strong.<br/><br/>The ""Men in Black"" film series is loosely based on an early '90s comic book series about a secret government organization which monitors supernatural phenomena, alien activities and safeguards against alien threats. These premises must have been in vogue in the early '90s, as at the same time there was a television series similar in structure that had the tagline ""Trust No One"" (that show also had a ""foxy"" redhead for additional sex appeal). For the ""Men in Black"" films, the supernatural angle has been dropped in favor of staying focused on alien matters only.<br/><br/>""Men in Black 3"" (with a standard numeral in the title unlike the second movie that featured a Roman numeral ""II"") is an unlikely sequel. The other two ""MiB"" movies were self-contained adventures and the interest of a third installment really wasn't in demand. The good news is ""Men in Black 3"" is actually a decent continuation.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the escape of the intergalactic criminal Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement, ""Dinner for Schmucks"") from his 40-year incarceration in the Lunar-Max Penitentiary. He is one volatile, mean and ugly hombre. He is also the last survivor of his conquering race of Boglodites that destroy worlds. He was put on ice in 1969 by Special Agent ""K"" (Tommy Lee Jones, ""Captain America"") at Cape Canaveral during the Apollo 11 launch. In the pursuit, Boris lost his left arm and swore revenge on Agent K at all costs.<br/><br/>The plan Boris has is a fairly simple one: he will go back in time to the events that lead to his apprehension and kill Agent K. To do so would have a catastrophic effect on the future. In the original timeline, Agent K is also responsible for placing a special global shield on the tip of the Apollo 11 module that was activated in orbit to protect Earth from the imminent invasion of the Boglodites. Without Agent K to put the shield in place the world is in one heck of a predicament.<br/><br/>Boris the Animal has a run-in with Agent K and his partner Agent J (Will Smith, ""I am Legend"") before time-traveling to the past. His parting words to K are ""You are already dead. You just don't know it yet."" How prophetic, as the timeline is changed the moment Boris goes back. The only person unaffected by the changes is Agent J. He is aware of the timeline changes. He did not change with it because he is believed to have been present at the events in 1969. Therefore, we have a time paradox, and it is now necessary for Agent J to venture to the past.<br/><br/>""Men in Black 3"" has fun with time-travel on several fronts, the best one involving meeting the younger Special Agent K in 1969. He's played by Josh Brolin (""True Grit"") who was made to look like actor Tommy Lee Jones. That's easy enough to do with a little make-up and combing his hair a certain way. Brolin stands out in the role by his posture, mannerisms and speech patterns. He is so uncannily like Tommy Lee Jones in his performance. Allegedly the film's director Barry Sonnenfeld (who directed all the movies in this series) shed tears of relief during Brolin's audition. Having Brolin cast is better than any of the over-the-top special effects that could have made Tommy Lee Jones look younger.<br/><br/>An interesting addition to this picture is the alien Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Hugo""). He is one of the most likable and engaging characters I've seen in years in the movies. Griffin, like Boris, is the last of his race and living on Earth. He dresses like the video camera kid from ""American Beauty"" (1999) and the youngsters from ""South Park"" (1999). He is able to envision the futures of various possible outcomes which he sees in his mind. He is humble and wise as he delights in the simple things, like the outcome of a baseball game that hasn't happened yet. How he aids Agents K & J in their mission is one of the movie's charms.<br/><br/>Like its predecessors, ""Men in Black 3"" is special effects laden, mostly involving the various alien races that reside on Earth in hiding. They are creative in appearance and at times surprising in their individual functions. Take Boris the Animal for instance. He is symbiotic with parasitic creatures that live in his palm. Too weird. In keeping with the other films, this one is heavy with goo. Whether it is an alien being splattered or simply goo oozing out of them, the ""MiB"" movies love their goo. I'm not sure why these movies adhere to this prerequisite. No doubt there is some marketing ""goo""-ru behind this.<br/><br/>""Men in Black 3"" is a fun popcorn movie. It is light and easy to get into. ""The Big-Budget Will Smith Fantasy-Summer-Movie"" for 2012 is a gooey good time. By the film's closure there is new light shed on the K and J dynamic. It's unexpected and touching. A third movie in a series seldom has originality and heart. This one does."

","Before watching MIB3,i re-watch MIB1-2 and remind about the story and characters. It has been a decade since the last MIB film was released. Agent J is still Agent J (Will Smith) and ""Agent K"" divides into younger and older ones. Yet,the spirit of Agent K is still there that he works with other Agents to maintain law and order and even save the Earth.<br/><br/>The sequel uses another perspective - a generic time traveling story like Source Code,The Terminator,Back to the Future and such like. Even though time-travel plots are commonly used by filmmakers, MIB3 combines this features with its original selling point - arrest villain and protect the Earth secretly. Use of neutralizer and black glasses AgentJ,K wear are retrospective of the MIB series.<br/><br/>Aside from these features, MIB3 still keeps the background theme music played in MIB1-2 and the text at the beginning and the end of the film. More importantly, the charming smile of Agent J and straight-faced old Agent K still imprint on our mind."

"rgkarim","7","3","8","25 May 2012"," Is it worth the Time?
","It's been a few years since I saw a Will Smith movie that didn't involve him being bitter or depressed. However, this weekend Mr. Smith stepped back into his role as Agent J, the Man In Black with an attitude. Now although I love the first Men In Black and I was okay with it's sequel, I had my doubts about this third movie. After all not many sequels have proved their worth. Does Men In Black fall into the same category, or is it one of the few sequels that actually worth seeing in the theaters? Read on to find out.<br/><br/>What could the world's best alien busting team possibly have left to do? Time travel of course, and Men In Black is full of time jumping goodness. In case you haven't seen the trailer, MIB 3 has J (Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) once again teaming up to investigate the extraterrestrial crime ring, while also ironing out their own personal issues. However, K gets taken for a little time trip and disappears from the world with only J having any recollection. J refuses to let his partner fade into the abyss, and instead decides to do a little time jumping himself eventually meeting the younger version of his partner (Josh Brolin).<br/><br/>Call me a sucker for science fiction, but MIB 3 was perhaps one of the better sequels I have seen in a long time. Smith and Brolin did a fantastic job in this movie, both still recapturing the classic teamwork of the original MIB. When they aren't working together though both actors play their characters well. Smith still has the same sarcasm and one-liners to make you laugh, while Brolin captures that stonewall dry humor that is both funny and driving at the same time. Jones on the other hand has a more limited role in the film than I anticipated. Although he plays a key part in the story, Jones actually doesn't get that much screen time in the film, which is quite a shame as I really enjoy his role as the monotone agent who shows little emotion. <br/><br/>Regardless of the acting though, the story was much better than the one we saw in MIB 2. Amidst the constant comedy of J's clumsiness and spunk, lies a tale that is heartwarming, sentimental, and quite fun. Now don't get me wrong this movie didn't have the most original plot, and it was fairly predictable with only the slightest twist here and there. Still this movie had a little bit of something for everyone. A few exciting fight scenes, some fast paced chases, and some witty use of technology are all in this movie, and should be quite entertaining to the audience. The team did a nice job bringing the extraterrestrial world to life, with all the gadgets, lasers, and alien goo looking fairly real. Yet one can definitely tell they designed their camera work to bring out the most with 3-D technology. However, another thing that helped keep this film interesting was the villain Boris (Jemaine Clement). Unlike MIB2's main villain, Boris had an edge that made him feel more of a threat. His personal vendetta with MIB was also a tad more exciting and better integrated that made a more exciting story. Boris though had a voice that was more humorous than threatening, which was probably exactly what they were going for. Though for this reviewer there will be no villain that can replace Edgar the bug from the first MIB. <br/><br/>There are some things I was missing in this installment of the series though. For one thing some of the classic characters were missing in this film, or only had a few seconds in the movie. Although new characters like Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Agent O (Emma Thompson) are welcome additions, there are some characters that shouldn't have been removed. A second weakness is the 3-D shots, which were a little over-dramatic at some points. I really don't like this new 3-D obsession as too many movie focus on shooting in that style and sacrifice other areas of the movie. I guess those are really the only two weaknesses I could pick up in the movie. <br/><br/>MIB 3 is definitely a fun adventure that many veteran fans will enjoy. The directing team went back to the roots of the original to correct the mistakes of the second installment. I definitely give this movie a recommendation for a trip to the theater, but I haven't figured out if it is worth the 3-D showing. For this sequel, I give the following scores:<br/><br/>Action/Comedy/Sci Fi: 8.0 Movie overall: 7.0-7.5<br/><br/>Until my next review my friends, this is Robbie K signing off."

","After the battle scene in Chinatown, when 'J' a.k.a. Will Smith flashed his light in order to wipe out the memories of the Chinese actors, I swear I could see very clearly that there was a glow of watermark on their faces. This has never happened before with the previous 2 movies, and you don't get to see the same kind of glow on the face of other 'races' not even the aliens'! What does it mean? Does it mean that their faces were actually dirty and/or with germs and can only be detected under florescent light? The MIB franchise has a very highly supportive valuation and is very mush adored by the Asian/Chinese community since it first emerged in 1997. And if my claim is found to be true then MIB not only insulted those who have loved it but also betrayed the loyalty and trust we have invested in all the parties involved in the making of the movies."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Uninspired sequels often prove quite annoying for a true movie fan. However, dedicated followers of a franchise often overlook the flaws and are just happy to see their familiar heroes back on screen. Back for a third time in 15 years, Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) show they can do this in their sleep ... Mr. Jones may have actually dozed off a couple of times.<br/><br/>Fortunately there are a couple of things that make this one entertaining enough. Josh Brolin's spot on imitation of Tommy Lee Jones may be better than the real thing. Brolin seems to be enjoying himself and realizes he is the featured attraction here. There is also a very creative segment that takes place at Andy Warhol's Factory ... with Bill Hader pulling off the Warhol look and voice quite well.<br/><br/>Obviously with the Warhol segment, time travel is involved. That's the real disappointment here. Outside of the Apollo 11 segment and listening to Status Quo play ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"", the trip to 1969 is really a wasted opportunity for plot and humor. Also scarce is the use of aliens that were so prevalent in the first two. This time around, we get an overdose of Boris the Animal played by the always interesting Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords).<br/><br/>Also back is Emma Thompson in a couple of brief scenes as Agent O. In addition to Brolin, we get new life from Alice Eve (a young Agen O) and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin ... a less annoying version of Joe Pesci from the Lethal Weapon series. Director Barry Sonnenfeld has stuck with this franchise for all three entries. Let's hope it's now allowed to rest in peace."
"Fields201","8","3","9","26 May 2012"," MFields Review: Men in Black 3
","This is definitely an improvement over the last installment. I think what's great about this particular one is seeing Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones back together and the inclusion of Josh Brolin playing Tommy Lee Jones. That pretty much made the movie for me.<br/><br/>Okay, there are some things that bothered me about this movie, though. So the whole movie centers around time travel, right? Well how come when Tommy Lee Jones is ripped through time and everyone says he's been dead for forty years, wouldn't Will Smith be thinking the same thing? What makes him different from anyone else? Also, if Tommy Lee Jones' character was the one who recruited him, wouldn't Will Smith still just be a cop rather than being a part of MIB? Why is he working there if he never met K? It doesn't make sense! And how is it that very quickly people start believing in his time theory? It's like saying that someone went through time to steal my Rice Krispies because it magically disappeared right in front of me and the cop automatically believes me and tells me to go find a time machine.<br/><br/>But hey, I enjoyed the Josh Brolin scenes, though.<br/><br/>While I'm complaining, though, I have to admit that this is one annoying villain. I don't know, he just comes off as a bad guy that the main bad guy of the film would send to you when he doesn't feel like getting out of his chair. This Boris the Animal character just comes off as a mentally challenged bad guy.<br/><br/>But the action scenes (albeit short) were good and I enjoyed the chemistry between Will and Josh. Oh yeah, and there's this Griffin character too that knows everything about life and he's pretty annoying too. I know I complained a lot but I did enjoy the film. I wouldn't call it the best of the summer or anything but I'm glad I saw it. Oh and I can't stand 3D so I didn't see it in that."
"jdesando","Null","5","19","23 May 2012"," Best since Butch and Sundance.
","Agent J: Who are we? Agent K: We are no-one. Our mission is to monitor extraterrestrial activity on Earth.<br/><br/>Summer Sci-Fi just got a whole lot more amusing with Men in Black III, an entertaining action comedy with the best duo since Butch and Sundance. Will Smith as Agent J is light-hearted and lithe while Tommy Lee Jones's Agent K is stone-faced and stolid. Together they are fun at their repartee and sweet in their affection. The two have chemistry.<br/><br/>J must travel back to 1969 to save K from being murdered in the present. While time travel has been overworked in film, this case is at least carefully drawn: The late '60's are meticulously re-created, the action is credible, and Josh Brolin as the young K is spot-on with his imitation of Tommy Lee Jones. The chemistry between the early K and J is every bit as enjoyable as that of the older K. <br/><br/>The now required female agents' boss, Agent O (Emma Thompson), fares well as a sympathetic head of MIB, and her 1969 self (Alice Eve) is an accurate depiction of a young O. Times sure have changed now that females rule the roost (see James Bond, for example).<br/><br/>Bill Heder's intriguing cameo of Andy Warhol captures the ironic cool of the '60's, bashing the proletarian pop culture while at the same time adoring it. Baddie Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) can be as mean as any villain in The James Bond canon.<br/><br/>The sets are just as cool as they were in the first two MIB but less impressive given how used we are to CGI. The guns, well, they do grab attention. <br/><br/>Yet it is the attempt at character development that most impresses me, the need to go deeper, even back in time, to develop character. I never thought I'd be praising that effort in a summer blockbuster."
"paula_badin","6","2","5","3 October 2013"," Not a whole lot of fun - love Will though!
","No, Men in Black 3 won't make its way into my list of the best movies ever made, but walking into it with very low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. A decade was enough to make me miss the world and characters of MiB, and while this third installment can't quite match the feeling of freshness and originality of the first one, it's a huge improvement over the disappointing second movie, which felt like a weak attempt to milk a cash-cow while it's hot - MiB 3 doesn't have that 'sequel' feeling, feeding on nostalgia rather than tailing a fad.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did a lot of growing over this decade - Smith became one of the most sought after blockbuster stars in Hollywood, and Jones made some of the finest, most introspective films of his long careers (No Country for Old Men, In the Valley of Elah, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) and they both seem to have a lot of fun being back in their black suits, playing those beloved, silly, flat old characters. Smith in particular seems to take in his stride the fact that he has to step back into 'Fresh Prince' mode after years of playing more serious characters, he even seems to enjoy it quite a bit.<br/><br/>It's the supporting cast that makes the film, though - most notably Josh Brolin (Tommy Lee Jones' 'No Country for Old Men' co-star) who plays the younger version of Jones himself to truly terrific results. Jemaine Clement ('Flight of the Conchords') is a delicious villain (though the character is under-utilized), and smaller roles played by Michael Stuhlbarg, Emma Thompson and Bill Hader. It almost seems like memorable supporting characters is what missed most from MiB II - well, that, and a decent script. MiB 3's plot is a pretty senseless and illogical attempt at a time-travel story, with some elements of Terminator kicking in, but it doesn't matter much that it makes absolutely no sense - the script has heart and humor, and the movie is fast- paced and goes by quickly, not leaving that much of an impression but leaving a big smile."
"dlbach1","Null","2","5","3 February 2013"," Laughable
","Really sorry I spent the money to rent this movie on iTunes. It is fine that they didn't use a lot of the same people/aliens as used in the first two movies, but to alter the characters of the main characters just didn't seem real.<br/><br/>In Men In Black filmed in 1997, Agent K was still hung up on his girlfriend he had to leave behind when he joined MIB in 1962. However, in MIB3 when J jumps back to 1969, Agent K has completely forgotten his girlfriend and is hung up on a fellow agent who later becomes his boss. Also in the first movie, K had a taste for Elvis and the Beatles, in this one he all of a sudden prefers cowboy music.<br/><br/>Another oddity in this film is that J has a photo of Frank the pug hanging over his bed. This seems to be completely out of character for him.<br/><br/>The first two movies seemed to be more about getting rid of the bad element and preserving harmony between humans and aliens on Earth. This movie in past and present elements seemed to be more about kill as many aliens as you possibly can.<br/><br/>Historically speaking, in 1969 a black man would not have been high ranking in the US military with white men answering to him.<br/><br/>This will be one Men In Black I will not be adding to my collection."

","Sometimes, I feel tired by either the overbearing darkness or visceral humor of action movies today. MIB 3 gives me hope that the genre is not all infected with the malaise, that it is possible to combine comedy, action, emotion and terrific camaraderie in a warm feel-good package.<br/><br/>And yes, this is one rollicking MIB ride - black shades, neutralizers, alien celebrities and fantastic action included. Tommy Lee Jones is as deadpan as Will Smith is animated. Josh Brolin breathes equal parts of solemnity, humor and swagger as the 29-year old Agent K. And the script is perfectly balanced between credible facts and fantastic gadgetry. I saw this on Blu-Ray and loved how the medium does justice to this kaleidoscopic, colorful ride through New York - of the present and of the swinging 60s.<br/><br/>Great screen chemistry, clean comedy, balanced emotions and zany pacing make this the fun action movie of the year.

","The MIB team is again in the process of saving the earth from alien invasion, but this time Agent J (Will Smith) needs to go back in time - 1969 - to prevent Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) from being assassinated by Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement). <br/><br/>This was definitely worth the wait. We see excellent CGI with aliens interacting nice with each other and with humans, but we also see the bad CGI aliens fighting with humans; There were good acting performances all around, and a lot of comedy within smart dialogue. <br/><br/>A nice touch in the beginning was when there was a moment of silence and a sort of (read: really bad) eulogy by Agent K for the former head of MIB, Zed (Rip Torn), who had passed away. Zed's replacement is Agent O (Emma Thompson). We are not sure why Rip Torn was not in this movie. <br/><br/>A younger Agent K - back in 1969 - is played by Josh Brolin who steals the show, and nails Tommy Lee Jones' voice and cadence. That combination helps put this MIB (better than MIB 2 and on a par with the first MIB) over the top. Kudos. <br/><br/>Now for the question you may have: why didn't Agent J see himself when he went back to 1969. Well, that was 43-yrs ago and Agent J was either a kid or wasn't born yet. See?<br/><br/>We get a good script, plausible story, some good comedic lines, as well as some philosophical discussion when Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarj) comes on the scene with his predictions of what is about to happen. Griffin lives in all 5-dimensions and sees all possibilities and the outcomes of all realities (Yes, he has that Robins Williams look about him). He can transcend time as he appears in 1969 and in the present. We may learn more about him in future MIBs. BTW: when is the next one?<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff and not much of it. <br/><br/>Rating: A"

","This film is a major increase in quality over the first two, not that I did not think those were also great. There is a continuity to them all, that is capped off here.<br/><br/>A Kinky Woman (Nicole Scherzinger) visits a guy named ""Boris the Animal"" (""Flight of the Conchords"" Jemaine Clement), using the typical ""file-in-the- cake"" routine, which unfortunately works and he gets loose, blowing a hole in the ceiling of the joint, revealing the Prison as being on the Moon.<br/><br/>This guy is just a Menace, and he's got a little animal living in his hand that can shoot out high-velocity darts. He is actually an advanced guard for a race called ""The Boglodites"" who have to go from Solar System to Solar system, eating them on the way. Next target: EARTH.<br/><br/>But Kay (Tommy Lee Jones/Josh Brolin) had arrested this Creepoid back in 1969, and set up a defense grid called ""The Arc-Net.""<br/><br/>Boris gets down to Earth, and immediately resumes his 1969 Killing Spree.<br/><br/>At MIB Headquarters, which looks almost exactly the same as it has in the first 2 films, Agent Zed (Rip Torn) has died, even though Rip Torn himself plays a different alien guy at ""Zed's"" funeral. The Image of ""Zed"" is Kirk Larsen, not Rip Torn. And there is a new ""Head"" Agent, Agent ""O"" played by Emma Thompson/Alice Eve.<br/><br/>J wants to help out K as usual, but K just does not want J involved... And while waiting in his apartment, K vanishes, and his apartment changes... And J suddenly has a headache and wants Chocolate Milk. This is because Boris has found Jeffery Price, and jumped back in time to 1969, killing K.<br/><br/>The Next Day, J gets to work, and nobody else remembers K. He has a ""new"" partner, Agent ""AA"" (Will Arnet, who I just can't seem to place).<br/><br/>In fact, K's dead, killed by Boris in 1969... And the ArcNet was never deployed. And so the Boglodyte's invade, and J has to find the son of Obadiah Price, the only guy who had ever made Time Travel work, before MIB made it illegal: Jeffery Price (Michael Chernus). And so, to make a Time ""Jump,"" J has to literally fall from a great height. So he goes back to the day before Boris had gone back.<br/><br/>This is where all the fun begins, and Josh Brolin plays the young K as well as Tommy Lee Jones plays the ""Old, Busted Hotness.""<br/><br/>There is just so much great stuff in this, with Andy Warhol, who is ""Agent W"" (Bill Hader) and a crazy guy named ""Griffin"" (Michael Stuhlbarg)-Who has the gift of the ArcNet Shield for K, he is from a race of guys who can see all kinds of ways Time will unfold. Ironically, some of the action in this film, happens at the same Park where the final scenes of the first MIB film happened.<br/><br/>What is great about this film, is that it is a full circle of Time's Arrow, that refers all the way back to things that happen in the first MIB film.<br/><br/>The only bad thing I can think of, is that we had to wait ten years for this film to come out, after the previous MIB film. But even with so much time passing, director Barry Sonnenfeld was able to re-produce the production design of the first two. And although Frank the Pug is not here, J has some paintings of Frank in his apartment. And no ""Jeebs"" either (Tony Shalhoub).<br/><br/>So Now the MIB story has played out its full cycle, they really did a good job with this one."

","Let us discuss the summer buzz of 2012 shall we? AVENGERS ASSEMBLE, THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN, PROMETHEUS & MEN IN BLACK III. These are the most anticipated titles this year. . This summer is Elysium compared to the horrendous motion pictures we had to sit through during the summer of 2011. Whilst these are the most anticipated blockbusters by no means do I at any cost place money with either title for wins at the Academy Awards 2013? Nolan and Scott may have potential but let's just wait until it is that time shall we folks? A decade later a movie is been brought back to life by the very duo who gave it her first breath and made the title the financially successful hit it is. When Steven Spielberg asked Barry Sonnenfeld to get on board the MEN IN BLACK bus I am certain a trilogy was not in the cards. The movie has been a whopping financial success and has in some extent redefined the genre of Aliens integrated with comic relief and Humans once defined by Sir Ridley Scott. The boys in black are back but do they have what it takes to open this summer following the mega hit AVENGERS? Whilst Tommy Lee Jones has been quite the busy body making movies Will Smith comes back after 3 years since making SEVEN POUNDS. MIB is unofficially one of the biggest hits made by the duo and this come back is the ultimate challenge of their careers; re-inventing MIB. Senior Agent Jay (Will Smith) is 15 years down the line after he put on his last black suit. Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) as we all recall went back to his lady after his memory was wiped clean since he took a trip down the gullet of the Alien roach who was trying to steal the galaxy off the hands of the Arquillians. Jay has never been able to settle down since he lost his emotion-less bland faced mature stud Kay. Jay keeps neuralising every partner he gets simply because none of them is Kay I presume. Tiny bit of an indirect bro-mance is what Sonnenfeld is working on.<br/><br/>Lacking the laughter by more than half with comparison to the previous movies MIB III is focusing more on clarity of it story rather than being a comedy / Alien movie. Will Smiths fresh prince attitude has been restricted and a more serious department has been handed over to him this time as he needs to go back in time in order to save the life of Agent Kay and also thereby once again saving the world. Boris the Animal is the Nemesis who locks horns with Agent Kay who is called back into service and has his memory re-jogged back in. Agent Kay sadly does not have all the answers and neither does he leave Agent Jay with any clues when he literally disappears whilst sitting in his own apartment. With his disappearance the Agent we all know as Kay ceases to exist in everyone mins apart from Agent Jay. Agent Jay travels back in time to hunt down Boris and find out why Agent Kay does not exist in the present. Surprisingly he meets a rather lose and jovial Agent Kay from the 1960s who reveals a magical secret.<br/><br/>The concept of time travel is the save line for MIB III. Media speculates that the idea of time travel was initially and idea of Will Smiths, however a righteous shout and nod is much deserved by writer Etan Cohen. What a magnificent comeback MIB III has been. In this enthusiasts opinion this is an absolute winner in terms of resurrecting a franchise.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin should not be overlooked at any cost. It's amazing how Brolin and Jones are a smashing resemblance in personality. Josh Brolins talents are far more than what it was when he donned of cycling shorts in GOONIES. The resemblance of the younger Agent Kay and the older Agent Kay is uncanny. How Brolin has studied the characteristics of the older Agent Kay and play up to it is magnificent. With Precision delivery of Josh Brolin, with slap stick humor of Will smith and the presence of pure bad ass in Tommy Lee jones makes MIB III an indeed must watch this summer.<br/><br/>This movie is made for the fans of the previous movies and by far the best of the 3 in my opinion. What it lags in laughter it delivers in depth of its plot. MIB III isn't the best movie of the summer and its certain, however it will for sure be one of the top favorites of 2012. <br/><br/>Black Suits Coming! <br/><br/>TITLE: MEN IN BLACK III DIRECTED BY: BARRY SONNENFELD STARRING: WILL SMITH.

Now although the first ""Men in Black"" is the most simple one from the three, I enjoyed that one the most when it came out because the idea was fresh. And maybe it's because I saw it in theater when I was a kid. But this one is close behind and is a good time that is action to action without any slow moments. The plot may seem simple at first with agent J having to go back in time to protect agent K and to save the world from destruction. But there is quite a bit of clever and entertaining bits throughout the journey. Now I wasn't overly hyped when I saw the trailer to this, but I am glad I finally saw it.

Will is as always a extremely funny comedian with his character being a real humorous one, and has again done a marvelous job as Agent K doing the character again after almost a decade! Josh Brolin also does a marvelous job as the younger Agent K and its almost as if he's the young Tommy Lee Jones in this movie, such a great portrayel of Agent K's character by him. The Other actors have also done a decent job in their character portrayels, But i would have loved it if Tommy Lee Jones was shown a bit more.<br/><br/>Director Barry Sonnenfeld returns with another of this hit franchise after a 10 year gap after MIB 2 was'nt that good but he made sure that the 3rd part was a great one and did it spendidly as the acting by the duo is absolutely top class and he has shown all these time-travels, fights with super aliens so well yet again that it almost you're inside the movie at times and don't want it to end at times, its just that much entertaining at certain parts. Really Liked his direction in this movie, its quite evident he put a lot of hard work on it, and he deserves a praise for his huge contribution in this movie.<br/><br/>Well MIB 2 was'nt that good and i did'nt like it, But this has brought back that entertainment of the MIB series and the story in this one is quite interesting, with all these time-travelling and the cast was chosen superbly i must say, and the writers assured that an entertainment filled 100 mins was assured for the audience of all ages. The Visual team has made a huge contribution in this movie being so popular, and at times you just get mesmerized at how good the visual effects are! I loved that Time-Travelling bits in the movie and all those actions scene's are absolutely top class stuff. Hats off to the visual team, they have done another great job!<br/><br/>I Must say MIB 3 is whole load better than MIB 2 which i did'nt like that much, and with the inclusion of Josh Brolin makes the movie better and Smith has done another marvelous job as he always does, and a really good story along with excellent visual effects and great job by the director will assure that audience of all sizes enjoy this movie and fans of the series will definitely like it.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7.5/10"

Emma Thompson was fine as Agent O, and the story line with her involved was a good one, but I did miss Rip Torn. He made such a cool curmudgeonly commander. If Agent Frank, the dog, was in there, I must have missed him in the excitement. Since he became one of my favorite characters previously, I was hoping to see him in this one. Josh Brolin was completely phenomenal as the young Agent K. Unbelievable how much like Tommy Lee Jones he came across. And I adored Michael Stuhlbarq as Griffin. What a cutie!

Other than that, you get a bunch of special effects that can pretty much represent anything your imagination can fathom. It's fun, funny at times and, surprisingly, has an emotional ending. It is nice to connect the dots on some unexplained events and behaviors, but it all comes down to having a good time and enjoying your popcorn.

"estebangonzalez10","6","2","5","26 May 2012"," Men in Black Meets Back to the Future
","¨I promised the secrets of the universe, nothing more.¨<br/><br/>It's been 15 years since Barry Sonnenfeld directed the first Men in Black film paring up the unlikely duo of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. This concept wasn't entirely original as we've seen these sort o pairings in films like Lethal Weapon with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover playing similar characters. What I do remember about the first MIB is that it was very entertaining and had some incredible effects for the time. Now we have grown used to seeing these special effects, but I still enjoyed this movie thanks to the performance from the cast and it also brought back a nostalgic feeling. I remember that I started falling in love with movies during the 90's and MIB was one that I enjoyed very much along with Independence Day so Will Smith was one of the first actors I actually knew by name. Of course today after seeing thousand of films I see those movies and I don't find them to be as great as I first experienced them. I've grown into a more grumpy critic who expects more from movies, but MIB III brought back some of those nostalgic feelings so I ended up enjoying this movie despite it not being perfect, and rather silly at times. It's been four years since Will Smith had last starred in a movie so I really was glad to see him back in action. He is a great actor and brought a lot of comedy to his role with his big loud mouth. Both Sonnenfeld and Smith were able to make a better film than the first MIB sequel, and it lives up to the original one thanks to a clever script from Etan Cohen. <br/><br/>Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) are still working together guarding Earth from all the dangers of the Universe. They face a new threat when a villain from K's past named Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped prison and is looking for revenge after K shot his arm off and imprisoned him over 40 years ago. J had never heard about Boris until now and when he tries to do research about the event that happened that day he isn't authorized to dig any further. Boris gets his hands on some sort of time device and goes back in time to kill Agent K. J wakes up the next day with a feeling that something has happened to K and when he arrives at work and asks about his partner nobody knows who K is. At first Agent J thinks it's all a prank, but when Agent O (Emma Thompson) tells J that K has been dead for 40 years he realizes that Boris managed to go back in time and killed K. Now times have changed and Boris's race is invading Earth to destroy it. Agent J is sent back in time to try to save K. He ends up back in 1969 where he runs into a younger version of K (Josh Brolin) and together they try to stop Boris once and for all in order to save the planet once again.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film is probably Josh Brolin's performance since he plays a very believable young Tommy Lee Jones. His facial expressions and voice is really on the note and it is just so fun to see him imitate Jones's character. This was really my favorite part of the film along with some of the cameos and the clever jokes and cultural references of the 60's. Another highlight was Michael Stuhlbarg's (from A Serious Man) performance as Griffin. He got most of the laughs in the movie. Tommy Lee Jones didn't have a very big role in this sequel and he is getting very old, but he's still fun to watch on screen. Men in Black III is not a perfect movie, but it's entertaining and brings back some memories. I liked the whole back in time concept and it reminded me of other great films like Back to the Future. If you are a fan of Will Smith or the MIB franchise than you will really enjoy this movie, if not you might find it too silly. I really enjoyed Brolin's comedic turn in this movie and he is the highlight of the film. MIB III is an enjoyable and well made sequel.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"lalitdevraj","8","4","14","25 May 2012"," A well structured movie but depends on how you look at it
","Being a 17 year old, I watched the first two MIBs when I was quite young. I'm a Will Smith fan, but I still didn't watch the first two immediately prior to this one hence I had these Deja vu moments whilst observing, for example,the ""neuralizer"" and certain other specific aspects specific to the Men in Black series.<br/><br/>I rate this an 8 primarily because of the structure of a ""proper"" movie. Although it may not be a direct sequel,it was quite well knit with the MIB back story and the basic background of the whole trilogy (not that there will not be any other MIB, but let's see).<br/><br/>I missed Will Smith as I was watching the movie. He reminded me of the Will Smith I was acquainted to when I was young, characteristics that most of his new work does not explicitly express.<br/><br/>MIB 3 was definitely better than I expected. There was flow as mentioned implicitly before. Dialogue heavy at times, it makes one wonder ""Why?"" but it does make the whole atmosphere of the scene more profound.<br/><br/>Casting wise, the original lead cast members were intact (which in my view was a definite USP for the movie). The casting in general permitted a fluid experience hence it is redundant to say ""it could've been better"" as this is not exactly the case. The script was interesting with certain ways of making the audience try to understand what a character was saying which only made the experience a better one. Mind you, MIB 3 does not make one think too hard whilst watching the movie, but intrigues one really.<br/><br/>The 3D viewing, honestly, wasn't a big point to stress on. Yes, one or two scenes of course make it worthwhile, but with a 1 hour and 40 minutes duration, I highly doubt that two and a half minutes of screen time which utilized the 3D effect to it's potential is worth skipping the opportunity of a 2D viewing to wait for a 3D one.<br/><br/>Two words: Time Travel. The concept, new or old, does obviously impact the story a significant amount. To revolve about this concept may not appeal to some but hey, it all depends on you.<br/><br/>The movie does have it's moments but not a surplus amount like in ""Harry Potter 7 Part 2"" or ""The Avengers"" for example. In other words, MIB 3 does not appear to try that hard, which in reality, only helped give the movie a serene atmosphere, and again I stress, one that flowed smoothly.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I recommend this movie, and if some of you are wondering, no you do not need to watch the first two to understand this, but it definitely helps. Worth a watch, maybe two if you're that big of a fan. I would not watch it twice immediately but that's just me.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I want to watch the first two now! 8/10 suggests that it's worth it,so have fun! If you watched it already, hope you liked this review!"

","When Tommy Lee Jones disappears(he probably just forgot his way to set, they shouldn't worry so much), J goes back in time to prevent his death back then(and to get the plot going and improve the jokes, because they were really stretching it before then). When he gets there, the duo have to try to figure out how to ensure that what he did to prevent the outer space invasion that takes place without young K, played by Josh Brolin, whose performance(and in general, acting in this is marvelous) lives up to his casting decision: spot-on. And the character dynamic between the two is revitalized by this, and this aspect not only helps make this an enjoyable sequel(huh, I guess they did have that in them), it's just about the only original aspect to do so. Following the formula set up by Back to the Future(and barely focusing on maintaining the timeline), going into the 60's(because it's a different decade than ours, so it's funny! To be fair, like with Dark Shadows, actually to an even greater extent than that, it's just the backdrop and very few of the jokes and gags rely on that... they do the obvious ""the people around Andy Warhol were not from Earth!"" bit, but it doesn't take up much of this) and having someone be able to see things that haven't happened yet(can never have enough of those!)... that last one is genuinely likable, with his frailty and quirk(one of the aspects that made the first one great, that the second lacked(opting for being dumb, instead) and that this has relatively little of other than that). The villain is bland as they come(I am pretty sure he actually changes personality traits every time he goes off-screen), deep voice, ""scary-looking"", and several of the big action scenes(this is very much a Hollywood movie of today(seen in how worried it is that we'll lose interest if long passes without a fight or someone shooting at each other)... don't get me started on how this retcons stuff into the 1997 film that lessens that one), especially the first two, are completely pointless(fluff... if not poorly made at that). It's well-paced and definitely exciting, adding a sense of danger back into the franchise, albeit not getting rid of all the stupid MiB personnel. There is a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to those who want more of this series and like recent American cinema. 7/10"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","2","6","4 March 2013"," Series Keeps Getting Better
","Sequels are supposed to get weaker and weaker but I have found just the opposite with Men In Black. I think they've gotten better with each film.....at least, entertainment-wise. MIB3 is simply the funniest of the lot and has a nice little unexpected sentimental ending. <br/><br/>Good stuff.<br/><br/>If you simply want a fun 100-or-so minutes of escapism with a bunch of laughs and outrageous scenes, this movie will deliver that.<br/><br/>A highlight to me was the performance of Josh Brolin, playing a young ""Agent K."" Man, did he have Tommy Lee Jones' character down pat - voice, inflection, mannerisms.....just incredible. Kudos to Brolin."
"jonjojr","5","2","6","10 June 2012"," Just not the same
","I am used to Will Smith doing its comical sarcastic tone in both the first MIB and second MIB. That is what really set it off for me to enjoy both movies. In this movie (MIB3) Time has cough up to Smith. He had some good laughs but it seems like it has been toned down quite a bit. He no longer has that energetic presence on the screen and he no longer has the over the top gestures and faces. Josh brings a fresh look at the film. Must be that Tommy is also tired and old to do a lot of the scenes that Josh does that is why Smith was the only one in thus Time Jump.<br/><br/>The things I like about the movie is that they definitively kept the roots of the movie. Same tone, same music, and even fonts on the credits :)<br/><br/>MIB3 was not the best of all three, but it was the most touching of all. K was training a replacement (MIB), K finds The Light of Zartha(MIB2), and now K has always been grumpy because he had to cope with Js loss of his father in 1969. <br/><br/>Great film for the family and very good all around, just needed Smith to take it up a notch. It is was made the other two movies great."
"Laakbaar","8","2","6","9 June 2012"," Entertaining summer movie
","This is a perfect summer movie, wouldn't you say? It's got aliens (lots of aliens), time travel, futuristic technology, great special effects and 3D, a fast pace, a wisecracking Will Smith, cool chase scenes and wild shoot-outs.<br/><br/>For those of us older than 14, it's a well written, well acted film with a few good characters. Michael Stuhlberg plays an interesting character who can see ""fifth dimensionally"". The villain played by Jemaine Clement (Boris the Animal) is hilarious and frightening at the same time.<br/><br/>The movie lacks some of the more annoying, childish aspects of MIB II. MIB has always been a buddy-movie franchise, but in this version this aspect comes to the foreground. This movie is actually about a relationship, in spite of it all. Josh Brolin is quite good. The movie is very much focused on Will Smith. This movie is perfect for him.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is staged in NYC in 1969 so some of the background and humour relate to that. The alert viewer is rewarded with allusions and references of all kinds, including to MIB I and MIB II. The movie is richly planted with these Easter eggs. (I think the director more or less assumes you've seen the first two movies.)"

"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","2","6","5 June 2012"," Men in Black: Time Travel Defenders
","I remember back in 1997 when Men in Black came out, it was such a huge hit and Will Smith was on top of the world that year. It was a good movie and a big hit that naturally they wanted to crank out a sequel. The sequel wasn't exactly that good though, so you'd think the series ended with that. After a 4 year hiatus from acting on Will Smith's part, who has gone from fresh prince to box office success to a critical love child, you wondered what would be his comeback. I guess he wanted to go back to his old roots with trying to give life back into Men In Black. When I saw the trailer, I have to admit that in some way I was kind of excited to see this one. To see some good old nostalgia and see the awesome chemistry between Smith and Jones again. But time travel is a tricky plot that needs to be handled with delicacy and Men in Black does stumble quite a bit but is saved by Brolin's excellent performance as the young Agent K.<br/><br/>The intergalactic criminal Boris the Animal has escaped from the LunarMax prison on Earth's moon. He is intent on going back in time and killing Agent K, who shot off his arm and captured him. K regrets not killing Boris and returns to his apartment, where all traces of him disappear. Agent J still remembers K, though no one else at Men in Black headquarters does. Aided by electronic-shop owner, who created the time-travel device, J time-jumps off the Chrysler Building to reach time-travel velocity. With only 24 hours to stop Boris, J arrives a day before Boris kills K. Thus bringing him back to life in the future, but along the way finds out secrets of the universe that were meant to be kept for a reason.<br/><br/>Seriously, you would think that Josh Brolin is Tommy Lee Jones' long lost son, his performance is fantastic. The look, the mannerisms, everything he had down so perfect, it's actually award worthy. He also makes for Agent K to be very likable again and gives him a certain life that was missing from the second film. Will Smith, he does a good job, but he tries too hard at times. He's older now, we know that, but for some reason he's still using the same slang from his fresh prince days. It doesn't even fit in the 1960's era. But still I have to admit that he's got that same charm that makes you laugh and just love him. Jemaine Clement plays a great Boris the Animal, very threatening and scary and his make up is excellent. Though it was weird, my fiancé and I really thought it was Tim Currey because of his voice, he could be the next Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.<br/><br/>It's the performances that really make this movie because the rest of it needed some major work. The special effects are actually pretty lousy compared to the first film, like the green screen effects. You could totally tell when it was a green screen behind the actors and it's not hidden very well. Also there are a few plot holes with the whole time traveling issue as most movies that handle this subject have. It's a tricky subject of ""if someone I know now bumps into me in the past, will it affect the future?"". Also, how can you stop something from happening without getting the notice, etc. I did predict the ending with Will Smith's ""first time meeting K"" which my fiancé looked at me and asked if I wrote the script. It's just if you've seen these type of movies, you know where they're going with certain subjects. However, despite the problems with the film, I really did enjoy it. It's not the first Men in Black, but it was a better follow up than what we were left with in the second film. I would recommend it for a rental, at most a matinée just for fun. One more thing I would've changed was: can we stop using ""Empire State of Mind"" by Jay-Z for New York set movies? I mean, I love the song, but for this instead when Will Smith comes back to 2012, they should've cued the always catchy ""Men in Black"" song, I would've been more hyped for that ending, since it would be kind of weird for 44-year-old Smith to be rapping like Snoop.<br/><br/>6/10"

","It's been 10 years since we last saw Agent J(Will Smith) and Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones) whooping alien ass in Men in Black II. So I didn't know what people were going to think of Men in Black 3, the latest and probably last film in the series. We waited a long time, considering the original came out 15 years ago. But I guess it takes 10 years to make a sequel this good.<br/><br/>Agent J has to travel back in time to 1969 to rescue Agent K after Boris the animal(Jemaine Clement), an animal who lost his arm due to K, travels back in time and kills K. There he meets a young K(the brilliant Josh Brolin) who doesn't know that he's going to bite the dust in a day.<br/><br/>Men in Black 3 is a wonderful film. It's a reminder of what makes the series special, but this is the special one. Men in black 3 is occasionally hilarious and clever, with a large heart and great visual effects. Even after 10 years, the men in black aren't dust in the wind.<br/><br/>Brolin steals the show. He previously played Tommy Lee Jones' son in No Country for Old Men, but here he gets to be him, and he nails it. Smith, who disappeared for a couple of years, still has the same charisma that he always brings to the party.<br/><br/>You may not know what quite to expect from the film. But trust me, invest your time with Agent J and K, and young K too. I had a blast. Usually a series runs out of steam by the third film. But this one doesn't run out of steam; it tops the series. So, is it a bad movie? In the words of Smith: ""Ah hell nah!"" A-"

","Men in Black III is a decent movie only it pales in comparison to the first two titles.The one thing that made those two titles superior was the cohesiveness of humour,action and science fiction. In this third part the humour is barely present and in some scenes even get overshadowed by melodrama.I could have lived with the uninspired action scenes.Or with the downplaying of the science fiction elements.Even with the tiresome rehash of the ""which celebrity is an alien"" jokes.But almost no physical comedy and Will Smith not his witty self that is just unacceptable.The one and only redeeming factor was Josh Brolin as Young K.He easily stole every scene he was in.Only it wasn't enough.With all these talents involved you would have expected this to be the laugh riots the first two were.I only could manage a smile or two.In my opinion this entry should not have been made."

Boris has only one thing in mind.

She repeats K's line and it bugs him.<br/><br/>K's background is classified and J can't find any answers that way.<br/><br/>Then the impossble happens. Agent K disappears it seems he was murdered 40 years ago and for some reason only agent J remembers him.<br/><br/>Agent O believes J has lost his mind until he convinces her he isn't crazy. She then tells J there is one way and that is time travel. Go back in time and save K.<br/><br/>There is only one person in Manhattan who has access to a time machine and when J goes back in time and Meets a young Agent K played remarkably well by Josh Brolin. In fact Brolin's performance is one of the film's highlights. We get to see the MIB operate in the late 60's 1969 to be precise. And it's a treat. And for J to be teamed up with a Young Agent K is fantastic. Needless to say K and J are successful mission accomplished and J finds out about K's deep dark hidden secret and his greatest failure.<br/><br/>We find out more about our favourite men in black and that's just fine.<br/><br/>This movie has to be the best one yet in the series.

Still in present day, Agent J (Will Smith) has to also go back in time to make sure his partner, the elder Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is still around for the future. MEN IN BLACK 3 comes ten years after the previous film, which was a complete dud so the good news is that this film is much better than that. With that said, the film will certainly keep you entertained but at the same time you wish they had done just a little bit more to make it more memorable. The film turns out to be one of those movies where it's fun while you're watching it but by the time you get to your car the thing is almost erased from your memory. As you'd expect, the special effects and creature design are extremely good and they blend in well with all the live action stuff. I thought the look of the new monster was rather creative and I especially liked his ""weapon"" which was pretty much a little creature that could crawl out of his hand and throw blades. I was surprised to see that there really wasn't too much room for all the sci-fi elements that were in the previous two films as this one here is really character driven by the humans. There's a lot more story going on this time around and this certainly takes the thing into a few neat and interesting directions. The majority of the running time takes place in 1969 so it's Smith and Brolin doing most of the action and I thought the two of them had some nice chemistry and they were certainly entertaining. I'd also add that Brolin did a very good job at playing a young Tommy Lee Jones and perfectly nails some of his mannerisms. As for Jones himself, he's really just limited to an expanded cameo but it's fun to see him. The same with Emma Thompson. Clement is good as the bad guy and Michael Stuhlbarg has fun as a future seeing alien. The 1969 settings made for some funny moments including Smith being pulled over by some racist cops but I felt that more should have be done with the setting. In the end MEN IN BLACK 3 should keep fans of the series entertained but I think a little more work could have made the film better. However, I will say that the twist at the very end of the film was incredibly emotional and I must say that I was highly impressed with how powerful the sequence was. It's certainly nothing you expect to see in a film like this but it's probably the best moment of the entire series."

Maybe three-time director Barry Sonnenfeld was looking for another cinematic hit after spending most of his time on television work. <br/><br/>This time, though, Tommy Lee Jones has clearly lost interest because he only appears at the beginning and the end, passing the role of his younger (1969) self to Josh Bolin in a caper which combines weird creatures with time travel.

","The movie starts as just some funny sci-fi but once the charming actor Will Smith has started his time-travel, there is no looking back. Like the first two, again the soul of the movie is chemistry between Agent J and Agent K even when Tommy is not playing the Agent K. As expected there are lots of funny aliens, lots of witty one-liners and more than expected jokes on blacks involving Will Smith. The evil guy is mysteriously funny. Climax is imaginative and heart rendering. New character Griffin also provides the useful edge to the time-travel idea. If you are looking for a funny thriller then this one is good choice for sure."
"deatman9","5","1","2","18 April 2013"," Not bad but still not as good as the first one.
","For the most part this movie was entertaining enough. Much better then the second one was however not nearly as good as the first. The addition of Josh Brolin was a nice change he played his part perfectly however he plays a 29 year old so he was a bit old. Will Smith is back and he is talented and funny as usual as well as your typical Men in black story line. Evil alien trying to take over the world. Its up to the boys at the Men in Black to stop it.<br/><br/>The reason this movie was not as good as the first is mainly because it felt sort of cheesy. I mean this movie was made 14 years after the first one and I swear the CGI in this one is somehow worse. Despite it having an 130 million dollar budget for some reason they can only make CGI that looks cartoonish and childish as if its trying to appeal to young children which I don't think it is because it is rated pg-13 and there is some parts in it and I quote ""You are a piece of sh!t"" said directly at someones face. So- I think they cheaped out majorly on the effects and the story line was very typical and predictable.<br/><br/>Overall Fans of the original probably wont enjoy this one too much.

","I enjoyed highly the first two installments of Men in Black, and I would have given a higher score to this third installment if Steven Spielberg (the executive producer) did not succumb to a temptation that only few viewers have probably noticed. I am referring to the intentional injection of certain messages in the present movie. Here are three examples: 1) As Will Smith is about to travel back in time, he is reminded that he is returning to a period which ""was tough for your people"". 2) The scene where Will and another person are alone in an elevator. 3) The scene where two police officers question Will when is driving a fancy car. Normally, if I watched this movie when it first came out, I would not have been bothered at all by such scenes and I would have enjoyed this movie fully. However, in October 2014, I can detect the presence of subliminal messages much more easily. Here are a few facts that may clarify my point: 1) This movie was released in May 2012 (a US presidential election year). 2) Use of a similar technique has been made in the midterm elections of 2014 (in a much more open and shameful fashion). 3) I recognize the genius and impressive contributions of Steven Spielberg. At the same time, I am aware of his heavy involvement in politics in the last few years (for instance, his $250K contribution to the Senate Majority PAC in 2014). Anyway, in conclusion, this movie would have been much more enjoyable if it was kept as ""innocent"" as other Steven Spielberg movies (such as the excellent trilogy Back to the Future)."

","What would a sequel to Men in Black look like? This is certainly a question we wish we wouldn't have asked when the 2002 sequel was released with a flat story, an unnecessary revisit to characters whose story arcs were wrapped up, and an overall hit or miss version of the great comedy from the first film. It's been ten years since the underwhelming sequel hit theaters and fifteen since the original. The new questions are does this series deserve to be brought back? Is it something that people really want? Most of all; can a third movie to a fifteen year old franchise that was never really that special make the series relevant?

","When we last saw MEN IN BLACK II (2002), that was like 10 years ago. So what's been keeping off MEN IN BLACK 3 to arrive sooner back then? To begin with, this long-delayed third installment of the successful MEN IN BLACK franchise has gone a treacherous journey to finally make it to the big screen -- troubled shoot without a finished script, production delays, and a particularly controversial Will Smith's 53-foot trailer (nicknamed ""The Heat"") which angered Manhattan residents during the filming process last year. And thanks to all the delays and hiatuses, MEN IN BLACK 3 costs a staggering $215 million budget to complete this notoriously-difficult production. When this movie finally came out, I went in with a low expectation (after all, a big-budget tentpole movie with so much negative buzz is always a disaster). But to my surprise, MEN IN BLACK 3 proves to be quite a decent sequel. The good news is, this third installment is a huge improvement over the messy MEN IN BLACK II. But the bad news is, this movie doesn't quite matches the entertainment level of the first MEN IN BLACK (1997)...<br/><br/>Read more at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/05/men-in-black-3-2012.html"
"darkraven_109","8","2","7","28 May 2012"," Back in Style
","It's been nearly 4 years since Will Smith appeared on the big screen and an even longer time since the last Men In Black sequel (2002 if memory serves me right) but here they are, back in style.<br/><br/>While it may have been some time since Will Smith's acted in an action film (where he should stay, in my opinion), he proves that he's still got it in the third part of the memorable MIB franchise. He pulls off the wise-ass Agent J perfectly (just like old times) and he didn't fail to amuse me over the course of the film's running time. The whole cast did their parts well (especially Boris) but it was Josh Brolin who surprised me; the man was the spitting image of a younger Tommy Lee Jones. He pulled it off so well I honestly thought there had to be some sort of CGI magic or dubbing done but no, it was all Brolin and he pulled off a younger Agent K good. My only problem was that Tommy Lee Jones, who's as important to the franchise as Will Smith is, barely got enough screen time. Yes, it's part of the story that J meets a younger K and yes, Tommy Lee Jones is getting a bit too old for these kinds of movies but I just miss seeing him alongside Will Smith for an entire MIB movie. This however, does little to hinder the film's enjoyment factor.<br/><br/>The story is well written. Time travel is one of the more complicated story devices to use since if messed up, plot holes will appear everywhere. Thankfully, the movie writers took their time (10 years is no joke for both fans and producers), edited the crap out of their drafts and ended up with a good time travel movie along with a nice surprise ending. As usual, the comedic banter between mostly everybody and Agent J was done well but everybody gets to say something witty that isn't out of place in the story's setting. What really got me was the emotional factor that was added into the leads' partnership. Sure, we've seen them fight aliens and save the world in the past two movies but it's only now their partnership has become this emotional. Part 3 of the MIB series returns to the series roots and uses what made part 1 so great in the first place; a healthy balance of action, sci-fi, comedy and emotional content.<br/><br/>The CGI, to some, would look outdated (and to some extent it is) but this wasn't a problem for me. Instead, what the CGI did was usher in a feeling of nostalgia since it really looks like something from the late 90's when movies were just starting to incorporate computer graphics. Though for an MIB movie, there were surprisingly few aliens but that's just a minor problem. I guess that this time around, the story was really centered on the two main characters and not so much on what makes the universe so weird and cool (though I do miss the talking dog). Again, I dodged the 3D screening so I can't say anything about the 3D version.<br/><br/>MIB3 is a good watch; it returns to the series' roots and not only succeeds in making a movie so reminiscent of what made the 90's action films so great (balanced comedy, action and drama... and no fancy camera tricks like ""shaky cam"") but also threw in a new dynamic between the two main characters. I'm not sure if this will usher in a part four (and part 3 feels a bit like a series finale to me but that's just my opinion) but if it does, I hope the writers, again, take their time in perfecting the script since even if part 3 took an entire decade of waiting, it was well worth the wait."

"jon.h.ochiai","9","2","8","29 May 2012"," Yes, Men in Black are Back!
","In ""Men in Black III"" Will Smith's Agent J travels back in time to 1969 to prevent his beloved mentor Agent K, present day Tommy Lee Jones, from being murdered and avert the future destruction of the world from extraterrestrial invaders. Josh Brolin is awesome as the 29 year-old K, and younger version of Tommy Lee Jones. Brolin's performance authentically captures the Young K and essentially young Jones, in a way that is distinct homage and moving on its own right. His amazing performance wonderfully enrolls us in MIB3.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Etan Cohen's story possesses an unsuspecting poignancy and narrative twist. In one of the best scenes, Young K (Brolin) quietly confesses to J (Smith) in his southern drawl, ""You're a good man."" J gets it, and you see this touchingly in Smith's eyes. Realizing that this K is not the gruff Jones K, he replies, ""What happened to you?"" Will Smith is back in awesome form as J—all swagger, looking trim and fit in his black suit and tie. Smith is a master at balancing the smart ass bravado with palpable decency and humanity. Smith's historical sweet bromance with Jones transforms into something special with Brolin. That coherence solidifies Director Barry Sonnenfeld and Cohen's vision. I had seen an interview with Will Smith on ""Good Morning America"", where he said that he came up with the idea of MIB3 when they were filming MIB2 10 years ago. He wanted to connect up all 3 movies in some catharsis.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand: ""Men in Black 3"" is hysterical, and action packed with ray guns vaporizing dozens of evil aliens. I didn't opt for the 3D, given that the movie was post production 3D. Though it is visually stunning with the retro 1969 MIB look, and the cool motorcycle chases.<br/><br/>Cohen's writing is a brilliant mix of hysterical and subtle gravitas. Back in 1969, Andy Warhol is really Men in Black Agent W, played with comic genius by Bill Hader. While Young K and J talk with Warhol (Harder) about killer alien Boris, he tells his assistant, ""I'm taking a picture of a man eating a hamburger that is so transcendent"" I was laughing so hard. Back at headquarters, J tells Young K, ""A wise man once told me, don't ask a question, you don't want an answer to."" Brolin says, ""I said that?"" Smith and Brolin's partnership has a genuine worn comfortable feel. Just watch Young K order pie with J at a local diner—Smith and Brolin are hilarious.<br/><br/>The Men in Black (MIB) is a super secret organization that keeps peace in the world with the coexistence of alien beings and humans on Earth. Some of the aliens are people we know like Lady Gaga. Since the last movie, compassionate and strong Emma Thompson as Agent O is the new Leader of MIB. Thompson is great—too bad she isn't leveraged more. J discerns that the cantankerous K may have had a past romantic relationship with O. Anyway, as MIB3 opens one armed murderous alien Boris The Animal (comically hideous Jermaine Clement), breaks out of the convert lunar penitentiary. He aims to exact revenge on K (Jones), who shot off his arm and imprisoned him, by traveling back in time and killing him.<br/><br/>J (Smith) distinguishes something awry in this current alternate reality, where K was never his partner. Agent O helps J isolate the glitch. Apparently, K was killed over 40 years ago in an attempt to avert a world crisis. So it is up to J to go back in time and set things right by killing Boris. However, back in 1969 J and Young K befriend alien ally Griffin (innocent and gentle Michael Stuhlbarg), who cryptically warns J that death can only replace death.<br/><br/>Granted there are way too many aliens on the verge of distraction, and a lot of visual eye candy in ""Men in Black 3"". What keep us engrossed are the human characters and bating narrative—what is the source of J and K's relationship? Josh Brolin is the amazing standout. Will Smith has the star charisma to be in flow, and be the cohesive force in this funny and strangely touching tale. MIB3 may be a great as the first movie, and I hope they make MIB4. I think this story is worth continuing."

The special effects make for a great movie also. I saw this movie in 3-D and the characters were crystal clear and popping out of the screen. There weren't many flying objects in 3-D so you don't have to dodge flying objects. I give this movie a 9 because of that. Otherwise, I would've given this movie a perfect 10."

","Men in Black III is by far the best Men in Black Movie. Men in Black I was bringing the concept and the story about the 2 ""Men in Black"". Men in Black II more like a follow-up movie without a big blast. Men in Black III is great and I would say a nice surprise! My wife and I went to the cinema with the intention to go the movie ""The Avengers"" but that one was not at the time we arrived so we went to Men in Black III. Men in Black III was great: the characters, actors, special effects, aliens and the overall storyline were splendid.<br/><br/>I don't want to tell you much about the story because It contains some nice surprises I appreciated a lot and I don't want to ruin your joy of watching this movie. The review who is on top right now contains spoilers according to my opinion: I wouldn't like to know the things he has written in advance.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are both great actors. Josh Brolin as the ""young Tomme Lee Jones"" was also great. As usual you know Will Smith will control the movie. Will Smith remains to be the best actor who gives you positive energy. You can clearly see Tommy Lee Jones has aged and his grumpy face is great: I love him! His character remains to be the one of sarcastic grumpy man with a good sense of reality: he thinks before acting. Will Smth remains to be the humoristic positive man with a bad sense of reality: he doesn't think before acting. I really like these personalities.<br/><br/>Storyline, characters and especially the originality of all of the aliens: a big 8! Jemaine Clement as ""Boris The Animal"", the bad guy was great: he must be the best bad guy I have seen in ages because you really feel this guy is a big troublemaker.<br/><br/>What's bad? I think there could have been more 3D special effects in this movie or do I expect to much from 3D? At the end I pay more to see a 3D movie but I was disappointed on the amount of 3D scenes.<br/><br/>It was clearly a movie where both the actors as well as the director and his crew were trying hard to make this movie a enjoyable movie: it was not 'the best of the best' but a very nice movie with great actors, storyline, aliens.. you will certainly enjoy it....

","Love the first 'Men in Black', still find it an immensely entertaining film with lots of fun, thrills and excitement. Was far less taken with the second film, it was not that awful to me but it wasn't great. <br/><br/>While not as great as the first film (a tall order), 'Men in Black 3' from personal opinion, and most others, improves quite a bit on the second film. Could it have been better? Yes it could, and it's far from perfect, nothing done truly terribly but there are elements that come up short. But considering as expectations were not exactly high watching the film, with the worry that despite the appetising cast, that it would be one of those sequel too far films, 'Men in Black 3' was better than expected.<br/><br/>The script is hit and miss, there is some fun and witty humour but also elements that feel long-winded and stale. The time travel elements of the story sees some sloppy logic inconstancies, and while emotional the ending felt rushed to me. <br/><br/>As talented an actress Emma Thompson is she is wasted here in a far too brief role that she doesn't look completely comfortable in. Alice Eve is pretty bland. <br/><br/>However, 'Men in Black 3' is a good-looking, slickly photographed film with imaginative production design and make up and polished effects. The music is suitably adrenaline pumping and atmospheric while Barry Sonnenfeld directs in a way highly suggestive of him remembering what made the first film click so well. <br/><br/>Generally 'Men in Black 3' is spirited in pace, while having a mix of funny, witty jokes and emotional heart and a story that, while thin structurally and not the most original, has well choreographed action (the time jump is spectacular), fun escapism and charming buddy film elements. <br/><br/>Will Smith oozes cool charisma, while Tommy Lee Jones (despite being underused) is suitably curmudgeonly. Jemaine Clement is a menacing and enjoyable mix of the sinister and the camp, while Michael Stulbarg's Griffin is flesh crawling. Stealing the film is the revelation that is Josh Brolin.<br/><br/>In summary, pretty good third instalment, not top form but hardly bottom of the barrel. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"chakor-74657","9","1","3","15 April 2017"," A Great Time Travel Story and a Worthy Sequel
","Men in Black 3 has to be one of my top 5 favorite films of all time, along with the first Men in Black and a few others. With the five year anniversary of Men in Black 3 coming up, I figured that this would be a good time to finally write my review for it.<br/><br/>The basic plot of the film involves a villain from the past who comes back for revenge on Agent K. Boris the Animal, played by Jemaine Clement, escapes from Lunarmax prison and goes back in time to July 16, 1969 to kill Agent K. With the timeline altered, the Boglodites begin a full scale invasion of Earth, and Agent J has to go back in time to save his partner. As much as I love Jemaine Clement's portrayal of Boris, the best part of the film has to be Josh Brolin as the young Agent K. He's near spot-on identical to Tommy Lee Jones in terms of voice, impression, and appearance. When I first saw the film, I was highly convinced that a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones went forward in time under the name ""Josh Brolin"" specifically so that he could play this part in the film. Needless to say, the chemistry between Agent J and the young Agent K is pulled off very well.<br/><br/>As the two agents follow clues, they run into Griffin the Archanan (played by Michael Stuhlbarg), an alien capable of seeing all possible timelines at once. Griffin ends up giving the two agents the ArcNet defense system, which is a shield capable of protecting the Earth from the Boglodite invasion. It turns out that the ArcNet needs to be attached to the Apollo 11 rocket, which is a part of the story that I found very creative. There is also a very emotional part at the ending that I won't spoil.<br/><br/>While it has its fair share of plot holes (what time travel films don't?) and it's not the greatest film in the whole world, Men in Black 3 most definitely succeeds where Men in Black II failed, and it is a more than worthy sequel to the original. If you're a fan of the franchise and haven't seen the film yet, or if you're just into alien and time travel stories, you need to see Men in Black 3. You don't know what you're missing."
"zkonedog","9","1","3","7 March 2017"," As Much Fun As You'll Ever Have At The Theater
","The first two ""Men In Black"" movies were successful because of a simple Hollywood ""formula"": fun. By combining goofy aliens, cool gadgets, great acting, funny sight gags, wise-cracking humor, and enough of a plot to actually make you care about all that is transpiring, those movies were so genre-diverse that one almost can't help but find something to like. After a ten year break from the action, however, there was no guarantee that the lightning could be caught in the bottle once again for MIB3. Luckily, this film not only proves itself worthy, but actually clocks in as the best installment in the series to date.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, MIB3 sees a rogue alien escape from captivity and, through time- travel, wreak havoc on the MIB organization by causing Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) to no longer exist. As such, Agent J (Will Smith) must travel back to 1969 in order to set things straight, along the way meeting up with the younger K (Josh Brolin).<br/><br/>Like its predecessors, this movie is just pure fun, through and through. The time spent watching it will fly by (no boredom here!) as every scene contains some interesting nugget, whether comically, emotionally, or just plain exciting. Essentially, MIB3 is the perfect balance between ""summer popcorn flick"" & ""film series you truly care about"". While humor, action, and adventure are present throughout the film, the ending of the movie even takes an emotionally-charged tone that will likely have you completely stunned and perhaps even pulling out a tissue or two.<br/><br/>Of course, the acting within this film is probably what truly makes it a great experience, though. Will Smith slips effortlessly into his old ""black suit"" role, while Brolin is spot-on as the young K. Jones is, well, pretty much the same old Jones, but with an added character twist that really does help explain his character's gruff exterior.<br/><br/>Simply put, MIB3 vaults this trilogy into serious consideration when considering the ""greatest trilogies of all time"" debate. It is pure fun, but with enough emotion to make you care about the characters. Even after 10 years away, the black suits are indeed still as fresh as ever!"

","I absolutely love this movie. It brings the awesomeness of Agent Kay and Agent Jay, and involves time travel, inside jokes, and a new look for Agent Kay. This is definitely my favorite of the Men In Black trilogy.<br/><br/>In this movie, Agent Jay has to travel back in time, to M.I.B.'s early days, all the way back in 1969. He does this to stop an alien from assassinating Agent Kay, which of course, rewrites history. Back in the '60s, he finds young Agent Kay, and realizes that he's a very different man. Agent Jay also realizes that he and Agent Kay have a bigger connection, which no one saw coming.<br/><br/>Best part of the movie: The Cape Canaveral scenes.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Anyone who likes the original Men In Black movies, and anyone who likes comedy / action mixes.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous."

","Faster paced than the first and more entertaining than the second, Men in Black III is a worthy addition to the strange franchise, and lead stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones step back into the roles of Agent K and J like they it was yesterday. This adventures puts Agent J back in time to prevent a deadly plan that could very well change the fate of the planet. Josh Brolin nails it playing a younger Agent K, he's got the grunting and moaning right, the facial expressions, the blunt line delivery and empty emotion that Tommy Lee Jones brought to his character originally. Barry Sonnenfeld's style is in your face and nifty, the actors get right up to the camera and scenes jump from one to the next with energy, but the first twenty odd minutes before the time-jump are slower than the rest. I loved the opening featuring Nicole Scherzinger's debut role as Boris' girlfriend, she's actually very good and sexy as hell, as with Alice Eve's excellent performance as younger Agent O, but Emma Thompson is the scene stealer as the present Agent O. The 3D effects are impressive, most noticeably at the time jump sequence and the Cape Canaveral sequence which is just a technical marvel as the main characters battle it out above the launchpad. You'll be thrilled, entertained and left with a big cheesy grin on your face."

","Really, this is a late review, but I just started reviewing movies and this happened to be on Netflix tonight.<br/><br/>Overall, It is a solid addition to the MIB franchise. Really nothing new to add to what the first two films did. A few rehashed jokes, a few jokes to fit with the time periods, and a couple of extremely good jokes by the new additions to the cast... And that really is the focus of this review.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin's performance of a young Tommy Lee Jones is unbelievably perfect. I have a feeling Jones himself praised Brolin's performance. Considering that he basically not only had to impersonate a character, he had to also impersonate a person, Brolin really steals the show here and his performance makes this movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Jemaine Clement as Boris (Just Boris) the Animal was astounding. Considering that Clement falls more in line with being a cast member of Freaks And Geeks or even Bosom Buddies (yeah going old school)... It is astounding how well his ""geek"" stereotype persona translated into a character that was actually pretty creepy. For a mostly voice actor / musician, I really can't think of anyone who would have pulled off Boris better. Hopefully we see more of him in the future : this roll really showed that he can act.<br/><br/>And well, Emma Thomas as K was good, but she seemed to be phoning it in as she has in a lot of recent rolls. She was good for a few good laughs but really, too much talent for such a small role.<br/><br/>Overall, a very solid 6.5/10. One of the few Third entries of a trilogy that didn't completely fail, but also didn't really do much for the series. In general, MIB 3 is worth watching if you are a fan of the movies (or if you are a fan of the original graphic novels). Rounded it up to 7, but again, more like a 6.5.<br/><br/>Good movie, not great, but not bad, and really just fun to watch. So grab the popcorn and turn your brain off while Brolin proves that he is one of the best actors in the last 20 years. Seriously, his acting range from comedy/ drama / horror / romance is really just astounding."

","The first Men in Black was a hit. For some reason the second one didn't live up to the first. I think the general consensus was that it was okay, but more of a rehash of the original. However, number 3 - the sequel that comes after a decade - shows that they're back to their best. Okay, so maybe not quite as good as the original, but definitely a worthy instalment of the light-hearted alien-bashing series.<br/><br/>This time Agent J (Will Smith) has to travel back in time to stop Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) from being assassinated by a particularly nasty alien (oh, and save the world while he's at it, but that's a given for the Men in Black). Back in the swinging sixties (populated by more 'sixties style' aliens - if you've watched the original Star Trek series, you'll know what I mean) J partners up with K's younger self (expertly played by Josh Brolin).<br/><br/>If you've seen the first two, you'll know what to expect. There's nothing that new here, but sometimes that's not necessarily a bad thing. Men in Black was never meant to be taken seriously. It's just a popcorn film that will probably appeal to most people who like a healthy dose of silly sci-fi.<br/><br/>Just sit back, put your brain on hold and your dark glasses on... and enjoy."

","I wasn't prepared to like MIB3 nearly as much as I did; it's a rare third installment that delivers, and this one does. It's a much more intimate movie than the first two, focusing heavily on the relationship between agents J & K, and the origin of it. The special effects are seamless as always, not over- the-top. The scenes on top of the Empire State Building were very well done. <br/><br/>One quibble; why is that prop & set designers seemingly think everything in the future glows blue? I thought I was watching Defiance again. The plot isn't complex, just the usual threat to the survival of the planet, but this go-round time travel is needed to save the world. Throw in a couple of well done fight scenes & chases, the redoubtable Emma Thompson (who has never looked better,) Alice Eve, Bill Hader, a poignant ending, the first moon landing launch, and it's a well-crafted bit of fun worthy of exec producer Steven Spielberg."
"p-stepien","6","1","3","8 June 2013"," The Men Are Back
","When an interstellar evil mastermind Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from LunaMax, a moon-based maximum security prison, he returns to Earth to seek both revenge on his captor Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) as well as a means to bring about a Boglodyte invasion. In order to do so Boris steals an illegal time jump machine and travels back in time to eliminate the younger version of Agent K (Josh Brolin). In succeeding in doing so the future alternates with only Agent J (Will Smith) remaining aware that the time-line has been modified. Thus Agent J retreads the path of Boris and goes back in time to avert the death of his friend and the inevitability of Armageddon.<br/><br/>Lacking the novelty of the first episodes of the series, ""Men in Black"" remains one of the few buddy movies with true effortless charm between the main protagonists. The opposites of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith collide with sparkling results, thus making them a pure joy to behold, even more so when the comedy keeps in tow with the quality of their interaction. The risk of replacing Tommy Lee Jones with Josh Brolin as Smith's partner was therefore significant. But Brolin was truly remarkable delivering Agent K with aplomb (nailing each mannerism to perfection), to the extent that I actually checked whether Lee Jones and Brolin were maybe in fact related. Personal traits of Agent K are replicated with ease, whilst the appeal of the K and J pairing remained intact.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, despite high levels of enjoyment, ""Men in Black 3"" came off a bit stale in the post-Archive X era, reusing certain motives making the movie feel somewhat outdated, as if an attempt to revive a bygone era. This naturally has nothing to do with creature design or special effects, which are first-rate throughout. Barry Sonnenfeld delivers a movie, which is exactly as promised, and herein lies the main issue: the lack of adventure and freshness, which made the first two parts such memorable popcorn flicks. That said ""Men in Black 3"" delivers an unexpected emotional wallop with its story, which comes as a surprise, but nicely brings the movie to a well-deserved close."

","All of the MIB movies are fun, that is what they set out to do, and that is what Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make sure they do. The writing and acting are so inventive and fun it is hard to imagine anyone not enjoying it.<br/><br/>Will Smith is back as Agent J and in this installment a notorious alien, the last of his kind, is imprisoned in Lunar Max, the maximum security prison on the moon, where he has been for 40 years. But the alien, with the help of his girlfriend, manages to escape and make his way to Earth. The Men in Black must come up with a way to stop him or Earth will be lost.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is back as J's sidekick Agent K. And since this story involves time-travel back to 1969, Josh Brolin does a super job channeling Jones as the younger version of Agent K. I had never heard of Jemaine Clement but he is super as the alien, Boris The Animal. <br/><br/>Also good is Emma Thompson as Agent O, and my favorite scene is when she paraphrases with wild screams what an alien had said. Michael Stuhlbarg is another actor I had not heard of, he plays Griffin, a good alien who has the ability to see any number of alternate universes.<br/><br/>When Nicole Scherzinger came on screen early as Boris's Girlfriend , bringing him what he needed to escape Lunar Max, I knew I had seen her somewhere but couldn't place her until the closing credits. Then I recognize her as the singer, and also who had a reality TV show stint as a judge of a capella singing groups a couple of years ago. <br/><br/>Good, entertaining movie."

","After the awful MIB II undid the powerful end of the first film, I wasn't hoping for too much where this third film was concerned. I was pleasantly surprised. The film follows J and K after the escape of a villain known as Boris The Animal escapes a high security prison on the moon. Boris goes back in time to kill K, so J must go further back to stop him. There he meets a young agent K, played by Josh Brolin. The time travel plot could be hokey and annoying, as they often are, but Men In Black III tries really hard to ignore the science, but make it a valuable part of the plot. Brolin is magnificent at his Jones impersonation, which is essential as it immediately creates the same chemistry Smith has with Jones. I never once saw Brolin in this film, just a younger Jones. There are a number of fun sequences and interesting ideas, including a character that can experience all time and all possible realities at once. Jemaine Clement is a bit confusing as the villain, as you can't tell if he is trying to be scary or funny. When it seems like he is trying to be scary he is actually funny and vice versa. The effects were very creative at times, but it tried playing up to the 3D a bit too often. Hopefully this will be the last as the ending did tie it together nicely. A good, fun sequel, that avoids just rehashing the exploits of the first or second films."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","3","10 September 2012"," Appropriately Shiny and Slick, But Never Approaches the Magic of the Original
","The pieces are there, and they're moving in the right ways, but this long-awaited revival just doesn't feel right. That's partially due to a crushing lack of Tommy Lee Jones, who's relegated to a mere cameo appearance, but more thoroughly to a lack of conviction and casual, happenstance tone. It's okay for a comedy to be this thoroughly jokey and loose, but the formula that worked for this franchise in the past was a tight balance of those lighter moments with sharp, dramatic action sets. MIB3 may go through those motions, but the emotional punch that its predecessor had delivered so easily is almost completely absent here. Though the vast majority of the film is set in the free love sixties, the atmosphere also remains very modern, like attending a themed costume party where the host didn't get the memo. Excepting a few very easy sight gags and the eyeball-rolling location of the film's grand climax, this just doesn't seem to make much effort to ground itself in that era. Josh Brolin works an uncanny Jones impression during these scenes, but that act falls strangely flat when the real deal himself was on-screen only moments before, and in this case there's really no substitute for the real thing. Quirky and fun, but terribly thin and uncertain... worth watching for the effects and frequent nods to its genre-mates, but it's really no better than the underwhelming Men in Black II."

","The third installment brings the original cast (Smith & Jones) and director (Sonnenfeld) back together for one more romp of alien fun, and delivers exactly what is expected. If you are a fan of the MIB franchise, then you will probably enjoy this one. If you aren't a fan...then you might want to sit this one out.<br/><br/>Was a third installment of this highly profitable film necessary? The answer is easily no. Completing the Men In Black trilogy doesn't feel very epic, but what it does do is send the franchise out on a solid note. It's obvious that Hollywood is cashing in its chips by making this movie in the first place, but at least it delivers a somewhat entertaining film for a couple of hours and provides an escape from the real world that most movie viewers are looking for in a popcorn flick.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones provide the normal banter they have developed throughout the franchise, and Josh Brolin (True Grit, W.) has good fun playing the spot on younger version of Agent K. Even Emma Thompson (I am Legend, Love Actually) gets in on the fun delivering a funeral eulogy in a high-pitched squeal alien language.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by MIB 3's unexpectedly touching ending.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","12 August 2012"," Somewhere between the second and the first in terms of quality
","I was cautiously optimistic when I heard that they were going to make another MIB movie. The first movie was extremely good in my opinion and even the lackluster sequel had some good things in it. Plus, it's hard not to like Will Smith in pretty much anything. The man is the definition of likable. Add in the chance to see young Agent K, some jokes about the late 60s and more of those comically weird aliens - it all seemed promising.<br/><br/>And the movie delivered beautifully. I got pretty much what I expected. It wasn't as good as the first one, which had the novelty on its side and could really work all the good jokes in, but it was definitely better than the sequel. The stupid jokes had been dropped, the dog was thankfully kept out and as a whole the tone was kept closer to the original. It's still lighthearted and family-friendly, but it didn't treat its audience like we were mentally handicapped idiots.<br/><br/>And at the same time all the good things were kept in and focused upon. Will Smith's Agent J was still as good as ever, yet he had been given the opportunity to develop as a character. He's a senior agent now and thankfully the movie realized this. Agent K was good as well, and his younger counterpart was played brilliantly by Josh Brolin. Very good role performance in my opinion, he absolutely nailed the character.<br/><br/>Plus, the supporting characters were very strong, the villain, while nothing special, still welt like a genuine threat and had character, the imagery didn't disappoint and the tired time travel plot avoided the most obvious pit falls.<br/><br/>Still, I must admit that the plot was probably the biggest fault in this movie. Nothing was obviously wrong with it, but nothing in it was all that special either. It's your run-down-the-mill time travel plot to stop the bad guy, who has gone back in time to change things. If you're seen one of them, you've seen this movie. The movie manages to keep its viewers from getting bored by focusing on the characters and the somewhat dark, yet goofy atmosphere, but one could still see that the writers hadn't had any new ideas.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: If you liked the previous MIB movies or even just the first one, this one is definitely worth checking out. It's a decent action/adventure film and well worth your time as long as you don't expect it to be as good as the original."

","""A miracle is something that seems impossible, but happens anyway."" One of the pearls of wisdom that comes from Griffin, an extraterrestrial ""unicorn"" that joins the familiar (but unfamiliar) characters of J and K in Men in Black 3.<br/><br/>For the first 20 minutes of the film, a miracle was needed to save this film from being a complete embarrassment to the franchise. The dialogue between the partners was a caricature of that which entertained us so well in the first two films, as if they really had been doing the same shtick for 14 years—like an old married couple with none of the charm. Something had to change drastically, and fast.<br/><br/>Luckily, Boris the Animal is looking to do just that. Escaping from a very specialized prison, he time jumps back to 1969 to gain the upper hand on the junior agent that imprisoned him—- Agent K. As soon as he does, the grumpier-than-usual K vanishes, the world changes ever so slightly, and J is given his purpose for the next few hours of screen time.<br/><br/>This is at least the second movie where Tommy Lee Jones is portrayed in his youth. In Space Cowboys his voice was laid over a young man that looked almost completely nothing like him, but MIB3 enrolls Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men, W.) to take his place. And the result is creepy. From the look to the bearing, Brolin absolutely convinces as a younger K. The voice and accent are so spot-on it sometimes does seem as if Tommy Lee is providing it.<br/><br/>He is joined by a cast of impressive characters, supported by even more impressive actors. Griffin is a 5-dimensional being, meaning he can see every possibility for the future, all the time and is suitably awed. He is portrayed by Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire, Hugo) as a meek but engaging character who might remind some of a teddy bear version of Robin Williams. Out to kill Griffin, K, and whomever else strikes his fancy is Boris, so convincing in his role as an otherworldly murderous biker that it seems near impossible that the actor behind him is comedian Jemaine Clement— best known for being half of Flight of the Concords.<br/><br/>Missing, sadly, are a few familiar faces. Zed (Rip Torn) is no longer head of MIB, and Frank the pug makes only a few cameos in pieces of art. The Worms do get a few words in, as well as a bagpipe solo. All in all, the third installment of the franchise is different from the first two, but it ends up working out best that way. As we see in the first scenes, the status quo just no longer works. A new format saves the third movie from going the way most seem to, as bitter disappointments. And a twist at the end, though perhaps not completely sensical, is still sweet.<br/><br/>A worthy weekend watch.<br/><br/>Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

If you just want an easy going science fiction movie with some good comedy then this hits the nail on the head. There were some boring bits, but overall the film had some nice twists towards the end and was just the right length. I think this will be the last in the series. Some parts of the film were very similar to the previous movies, but there was enough wit in some of the jokes to keep you entertained. In the case of MIB 3 it delivers what you expect it to - fun, aliens action and will smith jokes.

","For some reason this didn't get a catchy song as the first two MIB movies did. Maybe Will Smith was too occupied doing other things (producing movies, looking after the career of his children and other stuff), but we don't get the treat of another memorable tune. Even if you didn't like the other MIB songs, you've got to admit, they stayed with you for awhile. But apart from this little ""omission"", every other ingredient is here. With a little twist on our beloved Agent ""K"" of course. If you've seen the trailer or read anything about the movie, you know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Getting Josh Brolin here as a major player was a big thing and he really delivers. There is also a cameo of sorts, of a major character of the other two movies. But it's not a ""talking"" part. Plus the usual ""Aliens"" among us in-jokes we have to come to love (hopefully).

As a second sequel to a film, that's exactly what it should be.

Almost all his films have reached at least $100-million mark, even in his early years, just like in ""Bad Boys"" (1995) and ""Independence Day"" (1996). And even more so, for me, Will Smith is Tom Cruise in black! You know what I mean. It's still about two MIB agents, one is strict and disciplined and the other one is the fun part. Yeah, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and agent J (Will Smith) are back! Thiz time, Agent J has to travel back to the 60s to save the life of young Agent K (Josh Brolin) from one of the most ugliest and notorious aliens that ever existed, Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement). My focus is on Josh Brolin who plays young Agent K proportionally. Josh Brolin has been a good character Actor. Thiz time, he can successfully mimic all the gestures which previously described by Tommy Lee Jones. Well, what do you expect? We're all just like Alice in Wonderland. In which we are about to see an unearthly world of freakish creatures. It follows almost exactly the same rules as its predecessors ""Men in Black"" (1997) and ""Men in Black II"" (2002), but only thiz time, it gets a big refresh with time-travel element. The film Producer personally requested Barry Sonnenfeld to continue directing thiz franchise and it seems they have made the right decision. Barry Sonnenfeld is the man! By the way, thiz is also the man who directed ""The Addams family"" (1991) and ""Get Shorty"" (1995). Once again, Sonnenfeld knows best how to play with these ""Men in Black"" things. The humor, the cool gadgets, Cast members, everything in its right place. What makes a movie good? One of them is the twist at the end of the movie. And in thiz case, they also put some twist endings. Yeah, it's another alien movie, a typical Special Effects exhibition and surely predictable storyline.

"The_Movie_Cat","6","1","3","15 June 2012"," ""Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke is that it be funny."" ""It's never been funny.""
","15 years earlier the original comic book adaptation of Men In Black had been a reasonably fluffy, lightweight distraction that comfortably passed an hour and forty minutes. The much-lambasted sequel continued in the same vein, and it's perhaps difficult to see why it's regarded as being so inferior to the original, given that both are just formulaic popcorn munchers.<br/><br/>This third movie in the resurrected franchise commendably tries something new, though does look tired. It doesn't help that Smith's schtick is now so predictable and by-the-numbers, and his assault of an interviewee at one press junket for kissing him does rather pull down the curtain on Will's media friendly facade. The fact that Smith could go from losing his temper to PR Will in just a couple of seconds does display how much artifice goes into the whole package, and how contrived the act really is. It doesn't help that Tommy Lee Jones spends the movie looking like he'd rather be somewhere else, making it a somewhat laboured opening.<br/><br/>Thankfully the time travel excursion to the 1960s and Josh Brolin's involvement perk things up considerably. There's still the lazy laughs and the dodgy racial profiling of Asian minorities (who, unlike Smith, aren't granted effacing empowerment), though the language and suggestive content is less family-friendly than a decade previously. But what's missing more than anything is an inane-but-catchy rap from Smith to bookend the entire thing. I guess this is one time that Smith DID leave us hangin' without bringin' us the fun again.<br/><br/>Yet what turns this entire thing around and makes it arguably the best in the series is a genuinely startling twist in the final ten minutes, one which, although signposted, the viewer didn't see coming because it's unexpected in a movie of this nature. Suddenly the no-brain piece of fluff retroactively fits itself and its former instalments with a sense of previously unexplored depth and motivation. It's so out of left-field for such a throwaway box office endeavour that it's genuinely surprising and makes you re-evaluate what you've just been watching. There may be life in this series yet, even if there isn't in Lee Jones' performance."
"blacey113","7","1","3","3 June 2012"," This film should not be as good as it is, but the sheer gusto and bluster with which it embraces itself means, well, IT WORKS.
","For many people this film had a lot to live up to, as a sequel to two well-beloved family favourites , and in my opinion Sonnenfield played this film perfectly. He doesn't dwell in the past, even if he based his plot round the concept, and try to reignite a story on hiatus for ten years. He takes the well-known, well-liked characters of his first films and plunges them into a new plot line, with a ""fresh"" antagonist, new allies and a new setting.<br/><br/>Men in Black 3 is, in one word - ""absurd"". In two, ""absurd"" and ""brilliant"". Having conquered space travel and extra terrestrialism, the Men in Black series has turned its attention to new dimensions; time travel in 3D. Hollywood has a long history in time travel, a concept with which many director's have grappled and come off worst. Convoluting plot lines with infinite ""butterfly effect"" ramifications until the whole film becomes ludicrous - a sheet of holes being desperately bound together with unsatisfactory explanations, leaving all other facets of production to fall by the wayside. MIB's success is in its wholehearted embrace of absurdity; it is conscious of its convolution and ridicules itself for it. Griff (Michael Stahlberg) an alien who sees all possibilities is an ingenious dramatic device. He soars over the usual issue of timeline changes with interjections explaining ""Oh it's this one"". Griff is the centre of the film's self-awareness and his interludes of wonder at the implications of small events on the wider scale, expertly capsulated in the ""Ball park"" scene, are a valuable addition to the piece. <br/><br/>Almost the whole film is performed with as much tongue in cheek as a hoarding hamster; even the often delicate subject of race in 1960s America is broached with a light hearted comic approach - resulting in some of the most amusing moments of the entire film.<br/><br/>Will Smith, the heart and soul of this film, blends his more recent, mature, emotionally delicate performances from ""Ali"", ""Seven pounds"" and ""I am Legend"" with his signature boyish quips from ""the playground were he spent most of his days"". Agent J is the Fresh king. An emotionally intelligent performance loaded with ""tch'all know what I'm saying"" wit and impeccable comic timing. The relationship, familiar to all those versed in the two preceding films, between agent Jay and agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin) is integral to the film's success. For all the impressive action sequences, laser blasting, one wheeled motor bike chases and general running around in fully rendered 3D, Barry Sonanfield recognises the importance of human story and maintains this focus. <br/><br/>In a moment the adrenaline fuelled, absurd laugh riot, gives way to a truly unguessable twist, a rarity in cinema today, and then a genuinely emotional sequence. Time is expertly utilised in this film, both as a plot device, and as a piece of film craft. Comedy timing was beat perfect, lengthy verbal appeals cut short with snap camera shot changes to our never-out-of-their-depth heroes face down in the dirt, handcuffed. Fight and chase sequences are interspersed with typical 1960s domestic scenes, intensifying the pace and gravity of the situation and simultaneously helping to create the clever self-awareness of ludicrousness. Revelations are revealed at pinpoint moments to spur the action on and prevent too long a lull in the narrative. Soundtrack runs almost throughout this film guiding the audience in their perception of pacing, becoming noticeable by its absence to create comic effect and reassure you that you've pressed the red button and are now driving on the roof in the sleek black movie vehicle.<br/><br/>The Men in Black series has always been light, and quick on its feet and in its heart and this has seemed to most its appeal, however Men In Black 3 gears this enjoyable creamy lightness and intersects it beautifully with a heavier emotional layer. As Jay stands still on the beach, finally fully realising his past, the series stands still for an incredibly rare moment and allows us to gulp it down like ""chocolate milk"" to cure our ""temporal fracture"" headache from the mile-a-minute film. It is at this moment that the motif of time, physically embodied in a sentimental stop-watch, comes to realisation.<br/><br/>Although perhaps the drawback of what ultimately is a clever, funny and entertaining family film written by a comic-book writer – characters may be endearing and emotionally delicate but they are not complicatedly layered, despite the clear attempts..."

","Pleasantly surprised. Sure, some of the jokes are right out dry and Will Smith's humor and facial expressions are very much a repetition of previous films. But I actually found myself laughing out loud, as I was tempted to laugh, several times.<br/><br/>Do not know if it is the movie that was better than the past ones or if it's my own sense of humor that has changed over time. <br/><br/>Men in Black is the state's secret police who handle extraterrestrial beings and are responsible for the public to stay ignorant of the existence of extraterrestrial visitors to Earth. International villain Boris the Animal escapes from a high security prison located on the moon and go back in time to help his former self to kill Agent K and allow the alien invasion of Earth. Agent J following the year in 1969 and teams up with contemporary young Agent K. hails jokes throughout the film, not everyone goes through, but enough is so good that the movie doesn't fall flat. It is also seen that the fx-guys put in some extra effort into creating new creatures and not clone something that we already have seen in other films. A favorite scene is definitely when Agent J fighting in the streets against an alien fish. The film also gives a completely different view of classic terms such as time jump. So I will give an additional plus for a lot of fresh ideas.<br/><br/>The 3d-effects was not OK at all. They sucked.<br/><br/>Finally, I recommend the film, it has a good entertainment value and is both fast-paced and fun."

","'MEN IN BLACK 3': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their popular roles from the hit franchise based on the comic book of the same name. The film comes ten years after the last installment (which was a disappointment to fans and kind of seen as the 'GHOST BUSTERS II' of the series) and fifteen years after the original. Barry Sonnenfeld once again directs and Etan Cohen wrote the screenplay this time around (based on an idea by Will Smith, while filming the last film). The premise revolves around Smith's character Agent J traveling back in time to save his partner, Agent K (Jones), from an alien assassination that changes history and sets in motion catastrophic events which doom the present. Josh Brolin was geniusly added to the cast this time around as a young Agent K. The film is a little hit and miss but for the most part it works and should generally please most fans of the series.<br/><br/>The film also casts Jemaine Clement (of 'THE FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS' fame) as it's main villain 'Boris the Animal', who is out for revenge on the man who took his arm and had him imprisoned for forty years: Agent K. After escaping his prison, on the Moon, Boris steals a time travel device that allows him to jump back in time to the day Agent K caught him (in 1969). With K now out of the way Boris is able to invade Earth with his alien race, the Boglodites, and no one is aware of K's former existence (over the last 4 decades) except Agent J. So Agent J travels back in time to stop Boris from killing K and invading Earth in the present. He teams with a young Agent K in order to do so.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Will Smith you'll love him here and he dominates the movie but Brolin does manage to steal his thunder with his spot-on impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones. Jones is great like always but his time is pretty limited in the film. Clement is great as the movie's villain as well and Michael Stuhlbarg (of 'A SERIOUS MAN' fame) is a scene stealer as well in a supporting role. The special effects are great and Sonnenfeld manages to keep the energy and fun going most of the time. It does get a little bogged down here and there and the script could have used multiple more rewrites but for the most part it's enjoyable.

"nickmesafilms","7","1","3","29 May 2012"," Men in Black 3 (2012) - I'm Agent M!
","It's been nearly 15 years since the original ""Men in Black"", which has always been one of my favorite movies, and it's been nearly 10 years since the disappointing sequel. Now after years of production issues, script problems, and minor casting decisions, director Barry Sonnenfeld brings us the third chapter in the franchise with ""Men in Black 3"", and even though I have a few pros and cons with the movie itself, this is still one of the more entertaining movies of the year. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as Agents J and K, still fighting aliens and zapping people's brains. But let's face it, since it's been so many years, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are starting to lose a lot of the chemistry that they had in the previous movies, and I wasn't really buying their chemistry anymore, even if Tommy Lee Jones does make that annoying stone-faced look throughout, which looked like he had no interest in being in this movie (but he was hardly in the movie at all, so I'm not mad at him). This just shows why I absolutely hated the first 20 minutes of the movie. Throughout the first half, it was filled with cheap jokes that fell flat, dull and careless moments, and some weird plot holes that make no sense. I started to hate the first half, as it went on and on and on. Also, Jemaine Clement, from ""Flight of the Conchords"", plays the villain, named Boris the Animal. But, come on, Jemaine Clement's character is probably one of the most least interesting villains in the history of cinema. He had nothing to do, besides growl and growl and....growl! Seriously, I was disappointed on how the movie started. But, once we start the time-travel aspect of the movie, that's when I started to like the movie, and enjoy it. Agent K has suddenly been erased from time, and now Agent J has to go back in time, to 1969, to save his partner from being killed by Boris the Animal. That's when the movie started to catch up, and that's when I started to enjoy and love it. The time-travel part of the storyline really caught my attention, and it was pretty interesting and entertaining. Also, Josh Brolin delivers a top-notch performance, impersonating a young version of Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K character. I really loved how Josh Brolin was able to play a younger Agent K, in such a clever and stylized way. I also really loved the chemistry between Brolin and Will Smith, because these two really got along more, and I easily bought their chemistry easily. Also, Michael Stuhlbarg plays a friendly alien named Griffin, who can be able see the possibilities of the past and future. At first, I got a little annoyed by his character, but then later in the movie, you start to know him a little bit more, and then I ended up liking him. Yeah, this guy seems like a nice guy. It was around the second half where the jokes got funnier, the storyline started to impress, and I was more entertained. Rick Baker's alien make-up effects are still refreshingly brilliant, the special effects are perfectly clever, and there is a surprising heartwarming moment near the final act that will definitely warm your heart. So, ""Men in Black 3"" was such a fun movie to watch, and I was really entertained by what the movie offered at times. I would say forget the first 20 minutes, and then afterward, you'll enjoy the ride. So, go check out this movie, before I go to your house, and use that neuralizer to zap your brain, and forget about this review! ""Men in Black 3"", in my review, ""undeniably entertaining, but sometimes poor""."
"EmmaDinkins","8","1","3","29 May 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: MIB back to the future.
","Men In Black 3 takes us on a journey into the past that was very enlightening because you recognize that you are given answers to questions that you did not realize you had asked. It turns out that we witness a fourteen year partnership has transpired between Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) that brings about the realization that the first MIB was fifteen years ago! We see that some of the original favorite characters real or otherwise like the worms are still around and others real or otherwise have moved on. The series has always had great villains whose endeavors will bring about the destruction of the planet, and the only reason we can continue in our daily lives is that we don't know about it. Thank you Men In Black for keeping me safe in my naiveté. This time around our villain is Boris The Animal (Jermaine Clement) who prefers plain Boris, who is over the top mean. It took me a moment to recognize who he is and then I thought Flight of the Conchords and Dinner For Schmucks, the make-up was done very well and I should also mention the special effects. Boris had an interaction moment that took me back to Time Cop, but I won't get into that since I don't want to give anything away. We know from the trailer that Agent J travels into the past to save the future and this adventure allows him to interact with a younger Agent K played by Josh Brolin. It was truly amazing how well he channeled the Agent K persona, if I didn't know that they were two different people it would have been hard trying to convince me that it wasn't actually a younger Tommy Lee Jones. The story has a lot of interesting dynamics taking place in the past all centered around Agent K and some surprising connections, the Agent K and Boris history is where the plot thickens. There were so many funny moments in this film and as with its predecessors there is a pulling at the heart strings moment. As always the special effects give these films such a realistic feel. I'm still impressed by how young Will smith still looks and how old Tommy Lee Jones looks. I hope that since the MIB helm is now in the hands of Agent O (Emma Thompson) that this won't be the final installment. The film gets a green light from me."
"harry_goodwin","6","1","3","28 May 2012"," Very enjoyable and brilliant cast
","Men in Black III was a very enjoyable film, although in my opinion it was the worst of the 3 i would still choose to watch it again in a heartbeat. Josh Brolin's character (Young Agent Kay) studied his character extremely well, all the way down to the voice, mannerisms, looks and even the lovable bickering between jay and kay. The only disappointment was that will smith's character (Agent Jay) did not have as much of a funny character as the previous films but yet still suited the part and related to the previous films well. I would recommend this to many of my mates and await the release on DVD. I would not miss out in watching this classic film of this enjoyable trilogy."
"moviewizguy","7","1","3","28 May 2012"," The sequel nobody asked for.
","Agents J and K are back...in time. J has seen some inexplicable things in his 15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as much as his wry, reticent partner. But when K's life and the fate of the planet are put at stake, Agent J will have to travel back in time to put things right. J discovers that there are secrets to the universe that K never told him -- secrets that will reveal themselves as he teams up with the young Agent K to save his partner, the agency, and the future of humankind. (Columbia Pictures)<br/><br/>It seemed that MIB3 was going to be all kinds of horrible. All signs pointed to it: The troubles during production (I believe Will Smith had problems on set, and the script wasn't finished when they began shooting), the horrible mess that was MIB2, the bland trailer, the lack of creativity going into the posters, having a sequel nobody asked for being released 10 years later, etc. Imagine my surprise when I had a huge smile on my stupid face when the credits rolled!<br/><br/>The key to the film's success is Will Smith and Josh Brolin effectively playing off one another. Brolin, in particular, gives such a fantastic performance that you think Tommy Lee Jones might have had his voice dubbed over Brolin's. Seriously, Brolin looks and feels like a younger Tommy Lee Jones, and it's not an impersonation. It's a performance. The rapport between Smith and Brolin is more entertaining than any amount of explosions would ever do for the film, and it's a good thing that their relationship IS the film. Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones isn't in the film that much, but he was good for how long he was in it. I would also like to praise Michael Stuhlbarg, who plays such a fascinating character called Griffin, and he is able to hold it on his own with Smith and Brolin. I also liked Jemaine Clement as the villain, who is virtually unrecognizable under the heavy amount of make-up effects by the great Rick Baker. I consider him to be my favorite villain in the series.<br/><br/>When you take a look at the good sequels throughout the past few years (Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight, Kung-Fu Panda 2, Toy Story 3, etc.), you see that they don't try to outdo their previous films. Their success lies in their characters and expanding their emotional arcs. At times, too many summer films focus too much on the special effects and action scenes while adding too many characters and too many subplots. MIB3, however, focuses on the characters, while the action and effects stay in the background. Sure, the action and effects are good, but what makes the film good is the way it humanizes Agents J and especially K and the way it gives them an emotional pathos. Of course, nobody would ever expect that from MIB3, which makes its payoff have more of a profound effect than anyone would have ever dreamed of.<br/><br/>One would argue that the unexpected critical success of MIB3 has more to do with the very low expectations from people after several years and less to do with its actual quality. I'm here to say it isn't that. MIB3 is a genuinely good film. Is it an amazing film? No. While MIB3 won't go in my top 10 of 2012, it's a damn good sequel nobody ever expected to be any good after MIB2. Despite the troubles during production, MIB3 somehow gets it right. Sure, there are big plot holes in the script dealing with time travel, but it's a rare threequel that actually doesn't suck. Indeed, it's a miracle. In my opinion, it's the best film in the series."
"tgooderson","6","1","3","28 May 2012"," Closer to Men in Black 2 than Men in Black
","Ten years after the disappointing Men in Black 2 and fifteen (really!) years since Men in Black, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are donning the black suits and Ray-bans once again. Agent J (Smith) and Agent K (Jones) learn that the alien murdering Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) has escaped his maximum security LunarMax prison cell on the Moon, 43 years after K arrested him in Florida. Boris gets hold of a time machine and goes back to 1969 where he murders K. J has trouble understanding what has happened and goes back to 1969 himself where he meets a younger K (Josh Brolin) and the two of them attempt to apprehend Boris before he kills K and sends an army to attack and destroy the Earth.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the first Men in Black film and will watch pretty much anything Will Smith is in so I was excited at the prospect of a third instalment of the franchise. Unfortunately I left disappointed. Quality wise this is much closer to Men in Black 2 than Men in Black. My two main problems were that it wasn't funny enough and that it was really boring. Will Smith is a naturally funny man and has bags of charisma but here his jokes fall flat and he doesn't seem cool enough. Jermaine Clement, who I travelled over 400 miles round trip to see perform as part of Flight of the Concords was also a little bit disappointing although his accent was very good he was neither funny or scary enough. I only laughed twice and these were both at jokes regarding the differing racial attitudes of the 60s and now. As for the story, yes there are alien bad guys and the threat of the Earth's destruction and the time travelling stuff was good but I wasn't gripped.<br/><br/>Where the film is successful is with the addition of Josh Brolin. He does a fantastic Tommy Lee Jones impression, getting the voice and mannerisms down to a tee. He injects a bit of life into the story as his K is slightly (very slightly) more at ease than Jones's incarnation. I also thought that the character called Griffin played by Michael Stuhlbarg was brilliant and I'd happily have sat through a whole film about him. Also, as I said the time travelling stuff was good and they managed to avoid either making it too complicated or full of holes. If anything it was all a bit simplified and too spelt out. Another thing I appreciated is that the film didn't go over board in its 1960ness. It didn't bombard you with jokes and characters and felt much more natural.<br/><br/>The CGI is very good although I felt that it was relied on a bit too heavily. I've always though that Men in Black is at its best when its human characters were on screen and sometimes it felt like they were looking for excuses to show off their CGI aliens. Another disappointment is getting to the closing credits and discovering that Smith isn't rapping. Instead it's someone called Pitbull with a terrible song.<br/><br/>In the end there isn't enough in Men in Black 3 to warrant a sequel and it doesn't come close to matching the original. The action is slow and dull and there are very few laughs but there are some good performances, especially from Brolin and Stuhlbarg and it's nice to see J and K back again. That being said, I don't think there is a need for Men in Black 4.<br/><br/>www.attheback.blogspot.com"
"s_campanale","9","1","3","27 May 2012"," Men In Black 3 - The Human Adventure
","WARNING! – THIS REVIEW GIVES THE ENDING AWAY! The original ""Men in Black"" was a small, quirky comedy that grabbed the public's imagination and became a cultural phenomenon, and like the contemporary ""Austin Powers, international man of mystery"", it became a victim of its own success, with its own spin-off series and a sequel that was overstuffed and tried too hard to please. When news came of the 3rd instalment 10 years after the last sequel, it really did seem like a desperate attempt to cash in on a once-vital franchise, especially as it came in 3-D. Stories about script difficulties and production problems lowered expectations even further. The film itself therefore is something of a pleasant surprise, an ""MIB"" movie for sure, but one that doesn't just try to dazzle us with the goodies. After all, we've already seen the weird aliens at ""Ellis island"" and the freaky creatures disguised as humans thing before all the way through 1 and 2. More of the same would have made it look stale and dull. Instead it does something very brave for a summer tent-pole movie, it tells a very human story. As in MIB2, it is K who is the engine of the plot, with a tragedy in his past the key to resolving a modern crisis. Boris the Animal, well played by the increasingly high profile Jermaine Clement, is the villain, though he exists more as something to be stopped, the enemy who is the catalyst for the tragedy of the piece, so he makes an impression but the film is not about him. Josh Brolin, whose appearance has been the source of much of MIB3s marketing and spin, imitates Tommy Lee Jones brilliantly, but it is never as a gimmick. He is a special effect that allows J to interact with the younger K in 1969, but you soon forget it is an impression, which is exactly as it should be. As in the first 2, there is a race against time and clues to follow along the city, but that standard ticking clock thriller model again takes a back seat to the human story between J and K. The action, while exciting (the wheel- bike chase for example) is quite thinly spread out and any action-fan seeking a mindless shoot-em-up will be disappointed here. Griffin, the 5th dimensional being who can see the many possible futures in the space time continuum is like a mixture between Robin Williams and Dr Manhattan (Michael Stuhlberg does an imitation of the younger Robin Williams that's almost as uncanny as Brolin's take on TLJ) is the ""3rd"" wheel that is picked up along the way, and becomes the Greek chorus to the unfolding story and its implications. Griffin, unlike the previous 2 ""3rd wheels"" is a man, and with the exception of Emma Thompson's new boss ""O"" (and her perky 1969 version played by Alice Eve) who also doubles as the undisclosed former romantic partner for K, there are no females in any prominent roles and no love interest. The 1969 setting could have been played for cheap nostalgia laughs effect as it was so regrettably in ""Dark Shadows"", but apart from a few race jokes and a visit to Andy Warhol's factory, little is made of it, which is a good move as it is the story we care about here not the music or fashions. WARNING- THIS PART TALKS ABOUT THE ENDING The films ending is where the human story plays itself out. The mission is simple enough, put the ""Ark-shield"" device in the nose cone of the about-to-take off Apollo 11 so it can protect against the future invasion of Earth, fighting the 2 versions of Boris (1969 and 2012) who are trying to stop them in a battle on the rocket's launch rigging that other critics have already noted for its evident ""Casino Royale"" inspiration. But though it is a satisfactory action ending, it is really just the stage on which the stories true focus plays out. The film has wisely been building up a sense of dread, of impending tragedy culminating at the launch, and helplessly we wait to watch this dark fate play out. That tragedy turns out to be of an almost ""12 Monkeys"" nature, as J, who remains a passive witness from afar, observes his father, an army colonel in charge of launch defence, sacrifice himself to save K from the vengeful Boris, making K swear to look after his son, who at that moment is a 5 year old J waiting in the car. K neutralises him, removing all memory of the tragedy, but also of his father, and promises to look out for him, so intertwining their fates forever. It is a moment played out with gravitas and pathos, the face of the future explained by looking to a moment in the past, and the relationship between K and J that has been the engine of the entire franchise now suddenly revealed in its true nature for the first time. Back in 2012, we see that K has never really changed from that bright cheerful 1969 version, that his trademark cragginess and surliness around J is the price of knowing the terrible price paid for his life, the awful secret he was carrying with him all these years. The film ends in a wonderful moment of catharsis as for the first time they truly know each other, and a new future promised for a 15 year old partnership. For a film that looked like a desperate attempt to ring some box office, it instead becomes the ultimate prequel, and a moving human story. Let us hope it does not pay the price at the box office for it"
"LloydBayer","6","1","3","27 May 2012"," Three's a charm
","Last seen in ""Seven Pounds"", Will Smith is back after a hiatus of quality time with the family; time that he has clearly put to good use considering the projects he has lined up over the next few years. Also returning is MIB series (now a franchise) director Barry Sonnenfeld , who, given the flaws of the sequel, has evidently jump-started the MIB saga with this third outing. Together, Smith and Sonnenfeld work their magic, but the true measure of fresh blood comes from the unlikely inclusion of a new character, without which MIB 3 would have been on an outer-space trajectory into oblivion.<br/><br/>Now a veteran, senior Agent J (Smith) and his partner Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) continue to lookout for illegal aliens and extraterrestrial threats to Earth. Their investigations lead them onto a trail left by 'Boris the animal' a dangerous alien K imprisoned 40 years ago. Now finding that K no longer exists, J learns that his partner has been murdered in the past, so travels back to 1969 to prevent Boris from killing K and altering history as we know it.<br/><br/>Going into this third outing, I wasn't very hopeful that Smith, nor Jones, would have any space juice left to revive the interest of Will Smith fans or sci-fi fans. Bringing Josh Brolin into the series changes all that. As the younger K, Brolin adds a much needed tenacity to this third part while ensuring his character remains vital to the story. The real crowd puller is his unbelievable likeness in personality to that of Jones, in that you can be mistaken for thinking his dialogue is voiced by Jones himself. While the first half hour of the movie appears to be treading the beaten path of the previous film, it all changes for the better once J time-jumps to the past and is heavily aided with Brolin stepping in as the younger K. This is further tweaked with Etan Cohen's screenplay, rife with ample comic moments that seem tailor made for Smith and Brolin. In comparison, Brolin comes up with some funny lines while Smith is tasked with adding depth and heart − resulting in a clever and overwhelming twist where the premise is the destructive nature of secrets. Other plot aiding roles come from Michael Stuhlbarg as a clairvoyant alien called Griffin and Jemaine Clement as Boris – the darkest alien villain in the series so far. Emma Thompson as Agent O does not add much to the story, nor is her inclusion to the film remarkable, except suggesting that O and K may have had a close working relationship.<br/><br/>Overall, Sonnenfeld vindicates the need for a third part by putting together a good story, juxtaposition-ed with laughs and cliff-hangers. However, considering the strong sci-fi flavor this year, MIB 3 suffices as pure entertainment for the masses and is unlikely to resurrect a cult following; at least not the type stirred by ""Back to the Future"". As reported, it may be another 3-4 years before Will Smith fans see him spurt out a few wisecracks. In the interim, ""Men in Black III"" is a decent choice if you want to experience a lighthearted sci-fi movie that does not require too much concentration."
"wsills8","6","1","3","26 May 2012"," Best of all 3
","Going into this film, I was unsure what I thought about it. I enjoyed the first film, yet didn't care much for the sequel. I was also unsure about Josh Brolin. Normally, he's a great actor, but when it comes to adapting a character from a book, Brolin's got a pretty bad track record *cough-Jonah Hex-cough*. The thing it did have going for it was that the trailers for this one looked good and Brolin looked pretty impressive, not to mention Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones. It didn't disappoint. The first 5 to maybe 15 minuets of the film start off slow and boring. At that point, I was hoping it would at least be as good as MIB II. Boy was it. Not only was it better than II, but it was better than the original itself. Josh Brolin plays a young Agent K to total perfection, and Will Smith turns in his best performance since I Am Legend and The Pursuit of Happiness. The main villain of this film also truly feels like a good villain, better than the original two probably combined. The story is good, the acting is great, and this film delivers quite a twist. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi films and wants a fun film. An easy 7/10 which, if I could, in my books is a 7.7/10."
"selarom-yar","8","1","3","26 May 2012"," A good Time Travel Movie MIB Style
","I have to say that when I saw the flick that it was a good one. It has some moments that were great and there were some that was not great and slowed down the pace of the move. There is a great twist and revelation in the movie and once you know what it is, it will clear up many questions that you might have had or just wondered about. <br/><br/>All together it is a well made movie and it was well worth the cash that you will plunk down. The 3D was post production and thus it is a gimmick to get you to spend more money, see it in standard and save the money.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"khfan250","8","1","3","26 May 2012"," A Rare Occasion in Which the Three-quel Surpasses the Original.
","Yes, the title is a true statement; everything that was good about the original ""Men In Black"" is done better in ""Men In Black 3"", which is quite a surprise, considering that the third movie in a franchise is usually the weakest. Now, I've never been the biggest MIB fan; I enjoyed the first movie for what it was: a flawed, but nonetheless, entertaining sic-fi comedy. The second, although I don't hate it, failed to live up to the bar that was set so high by its predecessor.<br/><br/>And now we have the third, and best, installment. First, the bad things. I found the whole time travel plot, although it does have its fun moments, a bit too clumsily handled. It seems a bit too clunky and interfered too much with the laws of space-time-continuum that have been set by previous movies. <br/><br/>The first twenty minutes of the movie seems too reminiscent of what made the second movie a flop. It's self indulgent, full of lame one-liners, and it sort of prevented me from enjoying myself. I feared I just paid to watch another bad MIB movie.<br/><br/>But after Tommy Lee Jone's Agent K is erased from time, the movie really steps it up. First of all, the villain is really good. The villains from the first two movies were...well, I don't remember. So I know a villain lacks charisma when I can't remember a single thing about him/her. The villain from this one is a lot of fun. He looks bit like Randy Savage and sounds like Tim Curry. He's got some good one-liners and a couple of cool fight scenes with the heroes. <br/><br/>While we're on the subject, the action in this one is a lot better. This is sort of a weird thing to point out, but the first two MIB movies are ugly movies. They look gross and dirty, which I think is what the filmmakers are going for. But there's so much grime and muck that the audience can take, so it's nice to see a cleaner MIB movie.<br/><br/>No doubt you've heard how awesome Josh Brolin is as young Agent K. His control and surly attitude capture exactly what Tommy Lee Jones brought to the table, but there's hints of emotion to him as well. ""Something hasn't happened to him yet"", so Brolin's allowed to show some happiness with Agent K's former life.<br/><br/>Final verdict: With the exception of the first twenty minutes, it seems like the filmmakers were able to go back and get rid of all of the snarky stupidity of the second movie. They've found their roots with the first movie and managed to make an even better movie. It's a good summer action movie, plain and simple."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","3","26 May 2012"," Well, I simply enjoyed it!
","Seems that this movie is a case of you will either like or you completely won't. Surpsingly enough I quite liked it! Surprising, since I'm not even really a big Men in Black fan.<br/><br/>I really do think that the reason why I liked this movie was because it was being less silly and over-the-top than the previous two installments. There still is plenty of fun and comedy present throughout the movie but just not too much of the silly kind. It lets the movie feel less forced, which all made it more enjoyable to watch. At least for me it really did!<br/><br/>But having said that, it still is a true Men in Black movie, with some familiar moments in it, which the fans will surely appreciate. But really not everything is the same this time around and I applaud the movie for actually doing some new stuff, even though not everything works out that well of course. <br/><br/>Even though this movie still has the same style and tone as the previous two Men in Black movies, some things still have really changed in this movie. For one, I feel that this movie is less about the aliens and science-fiction and more about its human characters this time. J and K are the true center of the movie and there aren't that many distractions from their stories. Another clear and big difference is the K character, who this time gets mostly played by Josh Brolin, who plays the younger version of the character that got and gets played by Tommy Lee Jones.<br/><br/>The greatest strength of the Men in Black series to me had always been the chemistry and dynamic between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. It made the movies fun and memorable but let me tell you that Tommy Lee Jones isn't even missed! Tommy Lee Jones still shows up but really for a surprising short amount of time. But the reason why you won't miss him from the rest of the movie is because Josh Brolin simply IS Tommy Lee Jones. He impersonates him perfectly and even looks and sounds like a young Tommy Lee Jones.<br/><br/>But really, like all Men in Black movies, it remains a far from perfect one. The one thing that is mostly keeping this movie down is its story. Not only doesn't it explore its whole time travel concept thoroughly enough but it also suffers from the exact same thing that all of the Men in Black movies suffer from; its villainous plot.<br/><br/>Really not all that much wrong with is main villain but his plot is kind of weak and feels underdeveloped and even somewhat secondary for the movie. You never get a sense of treat or urgency, simply because you don't always exactly know what is going on and you basically already know beforehand what the movie is going to do and heading for with its main plot line. It's all some typical stuff and the movie offers very little surprises, even if you don't exactly understand what its main story is all about.<br/><br/>The movie is nothing too great but it surely is a lot of fun and entertaining to watch, which does compensates a lot!<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"tbmforclasstsar","7","1","3","26 May 2012"," A very entertaining (even if unnecessary) installment in the Men in Black franchise
","It has been 10 years since Men in Black II and 15 years since the original Men in Black. Having been so long since the second installment, it seems odd that the choice was made to make this franchise into a trilogy. There didn't seem to be a call from fans for another movie, the length of time since the last movie is so great it is easy to forget what happened in the first two movies, and the stars of the film are a decade older than when they last played these characters.<br/><br/>But Agent J and Agent K are back and, even though we may have forgotten about them over time, they are still very entertaining.<br/><br/>The third film in the series, Men in Black III follows Agent J (Will Smith) and his journey back in time to save his partner, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), from being murdered by an evil alien named Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement). Teaming up with the younger Agent K (Josh Brolin) in 1969 when he was only 29, Agent J must find Boris and help kill him before he kills his partner and eliminates him from the future.<br/><br/>Before I go any further, I must say that I was surprised that Men in Black III was made into a time travel movie. It was a very easy and uninspired plot device and seemed like more of an episode in a TV show than an installment in a movie. If Men in Black was a TV show, we could look at this adventure and say, ""O, here is that one where Agent J had to go back in time to save K."" But this is a film, and now one third of the franchise deals with time travel.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with this was the amount of screen time Tommy Lee Jones had in this movie. Men in Black III is more of a story about the Josh Brolin Agent K than the Tommy Lee Jones Agent K. The problem that I had with this was that this is Men in Black. It is Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. These ARE the Men in Black. The equivalent would be Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes going back in time and solving mysteries with a Watson that Jude Law wasn't playing or Chris Tucker going back to 1920s Rush Hour traffic without Jackie Chan by his side. I know Tommy Lee Jones is older, but it sucks to watch a Men in Black film without more of him.<br/><br/>That being said, Josh Brolin is awesome in this movie. As I missed not seeing Tommy Lee Jones on screen, Brolin gives a great impersonation of him in his young Agent K that makes it feel like Jones hasn't gone anywhere. Brolin's timing, inflection, and posture all suite the character perfectly and he is really fun to watch playing off of Will Smith.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/menin-blackiii/"

This, of course, leads to a time-travel journey taken by Agent J (Smith), who must stop Boris before he messes up the future for K - and instigates a full-scale alien invasion in the present day. <br/><br/>It's the kind of movie that doesn't need to try too hard to win an audience over. We know the characters; put them in an interesting situation, and everything works out fine. Some movies throw in the figurative kitchen sink, the better to confuse the audience into thinking everything means something - when, in fact, nothing means a darn thing. MIB doesn't bother with trickery. The personalities of J and K - well established and reflective of the public perception of Messrs. Smith and Jones - meld so seamlessly and are so symbiotic that the actual plot is almost (almost) relegated to the background.<br/><br/>Remember, it can be difficult to create a decent third film in a series. There are no surprises with the characters, and presumably we know all about someone's backstory. In MIB III, though, we do learn a little bit about Agent K's past. But thanks to a vibrant script by Joel Coen, that past history is more complementary than front and center. I think a focus on just K's 1969 life would have made for a pretty dull movie. I mean, it's not as if he's Mr. Excitement, right?<br/><br/>Clement is a terrific, terrible villain as the monstrous Boris the Animal (""It's just BORIS!""); he has this nifty parasite thing that lives in his remaining hand, and when he aims the hand at someone, a dart shoots out. Pretty cool. Emma Thompson is also on board as the new head of the MIBs (her name? O, of course. Get it? O and K?); former leader Zed (Rip Torn) has passed away. Alice Eve plays the 1969 version of O as well. <br/><br/>An undercomplicated plot doesn't mean that the special effects are blasted in your face, though. In fact, they're kept at a minimum, again lending support to the charisma of Jones and Smith instead of supplanting it. There are some cool transportation devices in 1969 (but not in the current day, weird), and the time-travel device itself is wacky (it's a time JUMP, literally). The effects feel as if they're meant to be there, not that they're shoehorned in to make things look pretty. And that's a positive development.<br/><br/>Men in Black III is a typical, solid blockbuster action movie. Not all action movies can stand up to much scrutiny, and if you're Michael Bay they don't stand up to any scrutiny at all, not when your third act is always Blow Stuff Up. This is an audience pleaser with a fascinating plot, amiable performances, good effects and set pieces, and some funny dialog to boot."

","Well I gotta admit I went to the cinema with low expectations because of the second one, but I was very surprised of how good of a movie it was. Mainly Josh Brolin who gave an excellent performance as young K, which was, without a doubt the highlight of the movie. Overall the Plot is flawed but I nevertheless gave it a ten out of ten. !!!!SPOILERS HERE'S A BIG SECRET!!!! The ending where its revealed that the general was J's father was one of the more powerful scenes in the Film, yet it was unnecessary, as it ruined kind of the first Film, where K recruited J because of his abilities not because he was emotionally attached to him. Nevertheless one of the better Films of 2012"
"JoeB131","8","1","4","7 March 2013"," The Sequel they should have made the first time
","The good things I will say about this movie. It wasn't geared towards a child audience watching the cartoon show. Frank the Pug is gone and the Worms only have a brief appearance. Also gone is Agent Zed, as the actor playing him got a mess of legal trouble. The movie begins with his funeral.<br/><br/>So the criminal Boris the Animal escapes from the Lunar prison, and finds a time machine which allows him to alter the time-line so he returns to his race and kills Agent K. But only Agent J remembers the correct time-line. He goes back into time to correct things, and we get a young agent K played by Josh Brolin.<br/><br/>Some predictable plot twists, such as the colonel turns out to be J's father.<br/><br/>They also had the fun parts with the 5th Dimensional Alien who can see all possible futures.<br/><br/>Some stuff that didn't make sense. If K deployed the ARC net in 1969 and that killed all the bad aliens, then why did it take another 40 years for them to arrive? So it's a fun movie, kind of gets the franchise back on track."
"joetufano719","8","1","4","5 August 2012"," Very Surprised!
","I did not want to see this movie at all, since I saw the first preview. I expected it to be a terrible movie, but my Mom wanted to give it a try so I caved in. During the previews I kept telling myself, ""This is gonna suck"". Boy was I wrong! I still think that the 1st movie is best one, but this one is definitely a close second.<br/><br/>Plot (No Spoilers): Agent K encounters an enemy from his past known as ""Boris the Animal"" who Agent K arrested in 1969 which resulted in Boris losing his arm. Boris goes back in time to the year he was arrested to kill Agent K. Agent J then goes back in time to 1969 to stop Boris from killing his partner and from changing history.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great as usual, but a special nod to Josh Brolin who plays a younger Agent K, because he looks and acts exactly like the character. Jermaine Clements as Boris is amazing, and quite freaky also. The things he does with his hand made my skin crawl. And finally Michael Stulbarg, who plays ""Griff"", was out of this world! His character had these extraordinary abilities such as being able to see the future/possible future scenarios, and the way he said things like, ""unless it's this"" or ""it could go like this"" left me in awe.<br/><br/>The story (again, no spoilers), not much I can say but while slow at first, it got very interesting when we got to the 1969 scenes and I really liked how it had the 1960's feel. Special note: I'm a huge Rolling Stones fan, and I laughed at the scene where Agent K tells J about monitoring Mick Jagger (lead singer of the Stones), since he was a possible alien. Also without spoiling anything, there's a shocking twist in the final act that I don't think anybody saw coming. <br/><br/>Men in Black 3 is a really good and entertaining movie and a great improvement over the second one. Yes it is a bit cheesy in moments but it's a lot of fun. I recommend this to anyone who wants to give it a try."
"blackmamba99971","10","1","4","25 June 2012"," Groovy twist
","This was one of the most incredible sequels I have seen in awhile. 'K' and 'J'. Back together again for a more brilliant instalment in the series. Now with 'Z' gone, and passed away, 'J' must come to grips with his partners feelings. Or rather understand them in a whole new light. Thus a break out from the lunar prison built for one alien named Boris the animal. A creature of a ferocity which makes other alien nations look like choir boys. After Boris breaks out, he goes back in time to kill the younger version of 'K' before Boris gets his arm shot off by the man in black at cape Canaveral. 'J' in the meantime uses a device to go back as well to 1969 to stop Boris with his plan. Yet needs one individual to help him. A man or alien named Griffin. A seer who can always look into the future no matter what time or what year it is. Boris needs to kill any alien who has this ability because of the nature of his crimes. So 'J' and 'K' find griffin, and use him to see events which will help them stop Boris, and save the earth from a possible invasion of Mongladites. This was a very clever film, using famous figures from the past such as the astronauts for the lunar venture, as well as Andy Warhol in one sequence. Or even the famous party which Andy Warhol hosted. All of the past events was used in coherence to the movie's plot. I found this to be a refreshing film start to finish. And the very sad part, of where 'J's father was killed in the line of duty helping both agents stop Boris and saving the earth. This was a bit of a tear jerker, to see 'j' as a young boy being handed a watch before his father was killed by Boris was sheer genius. Barry Sonnenfeld did a great job to hoist up the genre another notch, with the use of Josh Brolin who I thought was a dead ringer for the younger version of 'K'. But will smith was all around fantastic, his ability to see the humour in everything while being serious at the same time makes me smile. I love his acting, and his wit. To see him back in the saddle of agent 'J' was in my view a good wait for the summer. Other films will have to wait for my comments until I get the chance to see them."
"abdulselamever","8","1","4","7 June 2012"," Agent J goes back in time.
","Fifteen years after the first ""MiB"" movie was released, the story with revolting aliens and evil monsters continues.<br/><br/>In this explosive third installment to the ""MiB"" series, Agent J is forced to go back in time to stop an evil alien, (Boris the animal), from killing Agent K and destroying the world. Agent I ( will Smith) is forced to time - jump (literally) jumping off the top of the, Empire State Building, in to New York in 1969, fighting to save the friend (Agent K) and fighting to stop an alien invasion. Will he succeed or will he fail? You are in for a surprising but yet great ending.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was brilliant especially by Josh Brolin who played the younger Agent K. He had an uncanny ability to sound and act exactly like Tommy Lee Jones making the viewers forget that Brolin is not actually Jones. Brolin also looked a lot like Jones and this enforced the idea of Agent J traveling back in time.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a great movie which accomplished it's aim of entertaining its audience and if Boris was replaced by a scarier character it would have made the movie much more successful. Also, if the movie had been released around 2007, it's present quality would be sufficient but, since there is a 10 year gap between ""MiBII""and ""MiB III"" I expected a higher quality."
"Darkknight951","7","1","4","5 June 2012"," My take on the latest installment of the men in black series
","If you're looking for a film to put you in high spirits for the summer movie season than you're going to like but at the same time be a little disappointed in this particular film. Josh Brolin steals the movie playing an absolute clone of agent K he plays a likable but boring guy living in the 60s. Agent J has the typical one liner jokes that would be funny if will smith had cracked them in a fresh prince of be-lair episode but now many of them just roll off as being a little lame some of them are funny but most are second class in nature. The Villain Boris the animal is lethal and dangerous but not in enough of the movie to make people care about him he and K have a history K arrested him in 1969 for a multiple number of murders and created a net that stopped his kind from getting to earth but he breaks out of a prison on the moon and has a disgusting spiked organism that comes out of his hand and only he can speak to. The two agents have to find the being who has the net to keep the aliens out of earth by stopping Boris from getting it and killing K their is a great battle in the climax involving Americas first ever launch to the moon. The end is the best part it's a great ending and like Barry son field said in an interview ""it's very emotional"" but don't worry I spoil it but I will say this movie series should end a trilogy. All and all you should go to this film if you loved the first two men in black films you'll love this film dark knight951 out."

Not bad eh? Tommy Lee Jones is only in this film for a bit but Josh Brolin plays an amazing Tommy Lee Jones - Agent K. You would think at first that Tommy Lee Jones used his voice through out the film. But no... this is top class acting.<br/><br/>The film is centred on aliens. Obviously. Rescue the planet again. Generally speaking, all 3 films were based on this.<br/><br/>I would say kids should love this film. I gave it a 7 based on the fact I watched Prometheus recently. I gave that an 8. So no way this film is better than that.<br/><br/>Anyway, enjoy. I laughed a lot throughout the film and did not get bored.<br/><br/>Just word of warning.

Josh Brolin as agent K is pure class. this film really is for all ages. very well written very well directed and still very funny. Will Smith on BBC radio 1 in the UK recently stated he would happily make a 4th, i hope this comes true just a shame they probably wont have a place for Brolin. on another note i would like to applaud the writers for at least having a little mention that the USA for a black man in the 60's wasn't always the nicest place to be, they did this with class and added a comical touch to it for good measure, i think it would of been poor writing to send agent J to the 60's with no mention of this."
"Jonathon_Natsis","7","1","4","3 June 2012"," Bet you thought Andy Warhol was an alien. Nope!
","As it turns out, he's actually Bill Hader in disguise, who's actually one of the men in black in disguise, some of whom may or may not be disguised as present day Andy Warhol impersonators. Think about it. At any rate, the trip Agents J and K take to The Factory is one of many tidbits of 1960s culture thrown into a film that joyfully blends science fiction with the buddy-cop formula and family-friendly storytelling, resulting in an end product that plays to the strengths of the first film while omitting the weaknesses of the second. <br/><br/>Apparently working together for the last fifteen years hasn't brought J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) any closer together, because when we again meet the tandem they seem more 'original odd couple' than 'dynamic duo'. While J tries to get to the root of K's unfaltering crabbiness, his older partner is sucked back in time by Boris The Animal (Jermaine Clement), a ruthless alien criminal who has escaped his lunar prison and now seeks revenge against the man who blew off his arm. J learns that, in this parallel universe, Boris kills K in 1969 and wages present-day war on Earth, so it's up to him to make the save.<br/><br/>The performances from all involved are a key ingredient of what turns out to be a very enjoyable experience. The perennially underrated Tommy Lee Jones cruises, slipping into his role like an old suit (no pun intended), while it's good to see Will Smith back in the genre he belongs, appearing in his first summer blockbuster since Hancock. <br/><br/>Applause goes to Josh Brolin as the young Agent K, who mimics the mannerisms and general demeanour of his older counterpart flawlessly, and also for Michael Stuhlbarg. A genuine up- and-comer through his contributions to the excellent Boardwalk Empire, Stuhlbarg plays the film's most interesting side character Griffin, an E.T. who can occupy an infinite number of parallel universes. On the one hand, he serves to frame the series of events for the audience by explaining what must happen next, but he also parodies the notion of deus ex machina, in that he should be considered the ultimate sidekick due to his incredible recall, yet he is limited by this power and knows when to step down and let the heroes take center stage.<br/><br/>For the most part, Men In Black 3 keeps in line with the expectations set by the franchise. That is, an ebullient blend of low-intensity action with a refusal to take itself seriously. Little details are included to tickle the funnybones of more observant cinephiles. When we arrive in the swinging sixties, hand-held neuralisers are the size of living rooms and the typically computer-generated aliens living among us have been replaced by men in suits. <br/><br/>That said, expect to be caught off-guard by two elements of this film. Firstly, Jermaine Clement actually makes a menacing villain. Barring a lighthearted scene where he berates his younger self for not doing the job right the first time, Boris is all business, and some of his moments are the stuff pre-teen nightmares are made of. Secondly, the film comes right out of left-field with a poignant ending that acts as a brilliant payoff for a loyal fan base that has invested so much emotional interest in these characters over the last decade-and-a-half. K's disengagement is foreshadowed with a series of red herrings that only compound the film's final moments, resulting in an unexpected highlight that few people will see coming.<br/><br/>Naturally, many young adults watching this movie are going to look upon the first film with rose-coloured glasses when comparing the two. Comparative age is the key factor here because, despite its many positives, the original is nowhere near as funny at twenty years old. In that sense, this film applies the same ratio of hit-and-miss humour, but adds to it a lacklustre opening act and occasional inability to suspend disbelief. Surely, the battle between J and Boris atop the Apollo 11 as it prepares to take off would have been noticed by one of the millions watching. That, or the fight really did happen, everyone watching was neuralised, and Barry Sonnenfeld has just uncovered the greatest conspiracy in human history.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"

","Free falling, time travel, interesting linkage, Men in Black 3 is the answer you have been waiting for when we wondered what good will come of the MIB now when MIB 2 was a flop? Will smith pitched the idea of MIB 3 to director Barry Sonnenfeld during the shooting of MIB 2 the idea was creating a back story for Agent K which will feature Agent J going back in time.<br/><br/>Director Barry Sonnenfeld worked on the idea and with Steven Spielberg back as Executive Producer MIB 3 is one movie I will be seeing again.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays young Agent K in 1969, he did such a great job at it you'll believe you are watching K himself. Shooting was done in New York and it began in 2010.<br/><br/>This cliff hanging action packed movie tells a tale of what happens when you arrest instead of killing the villain. An alien nicked-named Boris the animal broke out of his prison (with the help of (Nicole Scherzinger) and travels back in time to change history and kill the man that put him in jail.<br/><br/>By doing the above he will achieve the destruction of the earth will and the death of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).<br/><br/>So J (Will Smith) travels back in time to help Agent K (James Brolin) save the world again and also save his life.<br/><br/>My high in all MIB movies is the alien characters; I have to applaud the costumes designers and the CGI developers on that. Also look out for the screenplay, as major events are happening on the screen at all times and there was never a dull moment.<br/><br/>I like a movie with a good story depth, but here in MIB 3 the makers have one thing in mind...make a better MIB movie than the last one(Men in black two was a total blunder), you want story depth? Go watch Men In Black 1.<br/><br/>This MIB movie does not have all the whole faithful present no Frank the pug, Jeebs or Zed.<br/><br/>When it comes to a job well done, hey Will Smith has finally done something worthwhile in years. I am legend, Hankcock and Seven Pounds were his last movies before MIB 3 and they all lacked the things that made Will Smith a name to go queue up in the cinema for. Also a nice job by the casting crew, James Brolin was the perfect man for Young Agent K.<br/><br/>There is talk of an MIB 4, I guess we will see. I employ you top go see this movie."
"zardoz-13","7","1","4","3 June 2012"," Black From The Past
","""Men in Black 3"" may be Tommy Lee Jones' last ""Men in Black"" movie. The Oscar winning ""Fugitive"" actor makes what amounts to a glorified cameo in the second sequel. He shows up for about fifteen minutes during the first act of this amusing, but tonally uneven farce and then disappears until about the last ten minutes of act three. Presumably, Jones wasn't agile enough to impersonate himself as a younger man in act two of this lively sequel. Consequently, ""Men in Black"" director Barry Sonnenfeld cast Josh Brolin as a younger Agent K for the contrived time travel plot in ""Tropic Thunder"" scenarist Etan Cohen's inventive but convoluted screenplay. Things seem considerably more realistic in ""Men in Black 3"" as the vengeful villain takes advantage of time travel to trip back to July 1969 and knock off Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) mere moments before the historic Apollo Moon launch. Meaning, since Agent K would no longer exist, Agent K couldn't have recruited Agent J. Remember, in ""Men in Black"" (1997), Agent K recruited plainclothes NYPD detective James Darrell Edwards III (Will Smith of ""Independence Day"") for his fleet-footed pursuit of an alien. ""Men in Black 3"" takes some outrageous liberties with time travel that haven't been handled in such a zany fashion.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Men in Black 3"" resembles the 1946 classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946) where James Stewart learns about the chaos that will ensue if he commits suicide. Unlike the James Stewart hero, Agent K must survive a murder attempt on his life or chaos will engulf Earth. A buffed-up Mick Jigger look-alike bad man named Boris the Animal has dreamed about killing Agent K. Bad-tempered Boris is an alien who has goggles instead of eyeballs, gnarly-looking teeth, a Darth Vader baritone voice, and multi-toed feet and harbors a crab-like critter in his hand. He likes to discharge deadly thorns from his hand, and his trademark line of dialogue is ""Let's agree to disagree."" Unless Agent J can run interference for Agent K, the world as we know it is doomed. It seems that Agent K was instrumental in averting an alien invasion of Earth with a small gizmo that gives off an emerald glow. He has to plant it atop the Apollo Moon rocket so it can be boosted into outer space. Of course, Boris both before and after the Lunar Max escape turns up to complicate Agent K's efforts. They battle like titans atop the gantry as the launch countdown reaches the two minute warning mark.<br/><br/>""Men in Black"" opens in Lunar Max, a maximum security prison on the Moon, built to confine the worst scum in the galaxy. Beastly Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement of ""Dinner for Schmucks"") thwarts an army of heavily armed guards with the help of a woman carrying a pink cake, and manages to break out. Just when the guards think they have Boris cornered, this larger-than-life villain surprises them with a stunt that staggers the imagination. Now, freed after 40 years of captivity, Boris decides to pay back the man who not only put him behind bars but also blew off part of his left arm. Of course, Boris' quarry is none other than resourceful Agent K. Agent K's only regret is that he didn't ice Boris when he had a chance. Mysteriously, Agent K vanishes without a trace, and Agent J gets the shock of his life at MiB Headquarters when he learns that Agent K has been dead for 40 years.<br/><br/>The original ""Men in Black"" offered a pleasant change-of-pace for science fiction fans. Essentially, this silly, ""Far Side"" satire cleverly combined the police procedural TV show ""Dragnet"" with the ""Star Wars"" cantina scene. Sonnenfeld has helmed all three ""Men in Black"" epics. Along the way, he has made some changes. Not only does Sonnenfeld eliminate Zed, but he also has replaced Zed with a younger woman. For example, Zed (Rip Torn) has died, and Agent K delivers a cryptic but dispassionate eulogy. Agent O (Emma Thompson) replaces Zed. Later, we learn that Agent K and Agent O were romantically involved. Unfortunately, the filmmakers fail to make the standard-issue, alien invasion of Earth plot feel refreshing. Sonnenfeld and Cohen do everything to raise the stakes in this outlandish sequel. Although some changes are obvious and accounted for, others are not so clear-cut, particularly the liberties taken with time travel.<br/><br/>The biggest change involves the scope of ""MIB 3."" Although the adversary is an alien, little about Boris prompts laughs. The decision to go into the past makes ""Men in Black 3"" different from the previous two films. Sonnenfeld and Cohen allow Boris to take things right down to the wire. ""Men in Black 3"" is the tail chasing the dog, but it is so energetic that you can ignore its lapses in logic. Brolin and Smith are charismatic enough even when the plot stumbles from one big set-piece to another. Some critics have skewered the logic of the time travel plot. How can two characters and their counterparts inhabit the same time and setting without negating their alter-egos? For that matter, how is it that Agent J can remain a Man in Black if Agent K weren't around to recruit him? After Sonnenfeld and Cohen resolve the end-of-the-world plot, they cap off ""Men in Black 3"" with a hopelessly contrived ending that brings the franchise full circle. The closure that comes with the return of Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K has an eerie sense of finality. Happily, ""Men in Black 3"" boasts some novel gadgets, like a motorcycle with one giant wheel that the motorists rides inside and jet-packs that resemble chrome-plated Gemini capsules.Comparatively, ""Men in Black 3"" surpasses ""Men in Black 2,"" but lacks the spontaneity of ""Men in Black."" Josh Brolin ushers in some refreshing vitality with his inspired performance as Agent K, and the ambitious plot resembles a sci-fi, James Bond escapade rather than a goofy actioneer."

","Men in Black 3 is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot a stellar cast that balance out the films dramatic and comedic undertones perfectly. It is a very fun follow up to the previous two movies, they clearly went out of their way to come up with a plot line that could not possibly match the other Men in Black movies, and they found a perfect one. Time travel was a great scenario to put these characters in to, it further establishes the complications of this universe, as well as giving us a new setting, entirely unlike what we have seen previously. <br/><br/>The only thing that did bother me is that this movie was released in 3D, which I myself am not a fan of, and in watching the 2D version, you can see a lot of moments that were clearly only made for the enjoyment of people paying the extra bit of cash. There are parts were something fly's straight past the screen, as well as plenty of moments where the actors face is directly in front of the camera. 3D should not define your movie, and I do not think any scene should be made specifically for it. <br/><br/>The cast is dazzling as always, Will Smith is still in great form as Agent J, playing the character with great charisma and ease, as if it has not been ten years since his last portrayal of the role. Tommy Lee Jones still brings in great screen presence as K, Emma Thompson steals every scene she's in as O and Jemaine Clement is absolutely stellar as the films main antagonist, Boris The Animal is without a doubt my favourite villain of the series thus far. One of the highlights has to be Josh Brolin, who is absolutely stellar as Young K, boasting an excellent impression of Jones, fitting in to this universe very nicely. <br/><br/>Great fun from start to finish. A terrific adventure that is funny and sweet, Men in Black 3 reinvigorates the franchise, with an original new story, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action comedy. <br/><br/>Agent J heads back in time to 1969 to stop an old nemesis of Agent K from murdering his younger self. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Will Smith"

Just don't like him. I like James Brolin but I thought he was poor in this. Even with the joke of ""city miles"", I could not buy him as a 29-year-old.<br/><br/>And the jokes. Most were bad and stale. A couple good ones but few and far between. They started a joke about a black man in 1969 but didn't do anything with it for the 2nd half of the movie. And on top of it they tried to sell me an African-American Colonial in 1969 without a second look (vs. bigotry at that time). I know they needed it for the story, but really!?<br/><br/>Another side element was that Will Smith couldn't be close to James Brolin. Why? I dunno. But it was a warning. Then it was forgotten.

The movie did great as an action film, but not so great as a Sci- Fi. <br/><br/>The comedy was done perfectly, except I would have liked them to cut down on the jokes for my action scenes, some scenes where left a banded. The movie has an amazing ending, but has a really slow middle. I really liked the movie because it just had wonderful CGI, when you could get it. The 3D was OK, but instead of having it in 3D, they needed to spend more money on the scenery in the 60's part of the film, it looked like we where in 2009.<br/><br/>The movie was great and very funny, but sometimes overloaded, and paced. The movie goes for 106mins, but I would rather have the movie go for 130mins and have some great action scenes, some more comedy, some more 3D scenes and some more Aliens. I have a feeling the movie was low budgeted.<br/><br/>I will give the movie this though, it was fun, funny and SOMETIMES entertaining. It did have good action scenes, when you could get them (which was very rarely), some AWESOME CGI (which I felt like we missed out on), and a really great ending (Very heartfelt). But really this movie shouldn't be called a MIB movie. Sorry, it was still good though."
"Cassidycotten","7","1","4","1 June 2012"," Almost a miracle. Almost amazing.
","Was it just me or did anyone else think that this film would have been better if Agent J, played by Will Smith, would have given his life to save that of his partner, Agent K. There was some definite foreshadowing to this story line with the funeral discussion early on, and again with Griffin advising J, ""Where death is, there must always be death."" As the story unraveled, I felt that instead of going for the knockout punch of an ""amazing"" or ""miraculous"" finale the MIB franchise gave us a contrived, bubble gum ending that saves the ability to create another MIB in 2022. I'd love to see the original script. All in all, it was a fun movie that missed its chance at greatness."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","1","4","1 June 2012"," ""Men in Black III"" is a film that is a little light on the comedy side but a valiant piece of entertainment.
","One of the few things that I love more than movies are movie franchises. That is, the handful of times where a sequel or set of sequels is not only acceptable but almost a requirement. Now I seldom like every single entry in a movie franchise, but I can settle for liking the majority. The first ""Men in Black"" film, released in 1997, was one of my childhood favorites. ""Men in Black II"", despite some redeeming features that unsuccessfully prompted me to give it a pass, was a disappointment. The third and possibly concluding installment in the franchise, titled – what else? – ""Men in Black III,"" dragged Will Smith out of a three-and-a-half-long year hiatus, and I'm glad it has. For the end result is a film that is a little light on the comedy side, but a valiant piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>The movie is also a testament to the versatility and outstanding talents of Josh Brolin, playing the younger version of Agent K. Tommy Lee Jones does reprise his role (quite well) as the sarcastic, deadpan agent with whom Will Smith bickers again and again. However, he's just sandwiching Mr. Brolin, whose performance really is the meat of the movie. The screenplay obviously supplied all of the quipping one-liners and the makeup department clearly took care of the physical appearance, but Mr. Brolin was on his own in setting down on the Tommy Lee Jones personality: the firm dialogue delivery, the Texan accent, the squint eerily akin to George W. Bush, and most remarkable of all, the ability to win an audience over by consciously underplaying the role. Mr. Jones made an instantly memorable character in the first Men in Black by keeping his character's emotions contained and Mr. Brolin imitates it immaculately. Now I'm sure there are some acting professors and critics who would claim this is more of a case of mimicking than acting, but as far as I am concerned, this is a winner of a performance. Acting, to me, is about manufacturing a character that the audience can, on some level, come to associate with and understand. Mr. Smith still has the charming personality that made him a star in the 1990s. He is also owed a great deal of credit for the success of this picture. In recent years, and movies such as ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" and ""I, Robot,"" Will Smith has developed a deeper delivery tone and a drive to pursue deeper, more solemn performances. It's been 11 years since he last attempted a performance of quite this nature, but it's a valiant return. He recaptures his lighter voice, quirkier mannerisms, and joyful qualities that made audiences fall in love with him when he was throwing out one-liners in a Bel-Air mansion.<br/><br/>I liked ""Men in Black III"" more than the second one, but it still is not quite the success that was the original film. The reason, I think, is that this new picture is a little top-heavy with the gross-out elements that were only half of what made the original movie successful. What made the original so special was its genuinely effective sense of humor. This new ones has jokes, but I would be lying if I told you that most of my reactions to them were not just token-laughs. Actually, my biggest grin was when I got another look at the Men in Black headquarters screen. In the previous two entries, we learned that folks such as Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman were in fact visitors from outer space; but when I saw Lady Gaga displayed upon that monitor, I wanted to bust a gut.<br/><br/>I was a little skeptical at the beginning of the picture and not really enjoying it. Not only were the laughs a little sagging, but the violent parts were a tad overproduced for a part-comedy. Early on, we see Will Smith rip out an alien fish's heart. Imagine if we had actually seen the alien cockroach of the first picture devour all of Vincent D'Onofrio's insides instead of just seeing the results; it would have been harder to laugh when he started asking his wife for sugar water. The new villain, a bearded scumbag whose flesh is composed of crablike joints, is played by Jemaine Clement. It's a really good performance; a moment where his character travels to the past and starts bickering with his younger self is absolutely priceless! However, the digital tweaking done on him goes overboard. Our first clue of his disgusting capacities is when we see a crab-like critter crawl inside of a hole in his hand and we get a close-up view of the process and see all the red insides of the hole. If director Barry Sonnenfeld had shot this from below, and allowed us to use our imagination (as we did in that cockroach scene I mentioned above) the effect would have been for the better.<br/><br/>Nitpicks can go a long way, but not when you look at the big picture. Yes, ""Men in Black III"" is uneven, it takes about a half-hour for the movie to clarify its plot and intentions, Will Smith's acceptance of what he has to do in the movie seems rushed, and two of our favorite characters from before do not make a return, but the movie overall is very clever. The way time-travel is explained here is a little hazy—and not very funny—but the way it is utilized and played with his a lot of punches and a lot of heart. I don't want to spoil anything, but we do get a huge emotional payoff after the climax. I would have preferred to have laughed more than I did, but ""Men in Black III"" does deliver as a summer sequel. And two out of threethat's not bad for a franchise. History is full of bigger duds that followed a smashing success. Do you remember the three sequels to ""Jaws""?"
"DoctorRabbit","7","1","4","1 June 2012"," Nothing Special, But A Huge Step-Up From The 2nd Film
","While it's still nowhere on the same level of the first film, Men In Black III is a huge step up from the second film and works good as a fun popcorn flick.<br/><br/>Will Smith does a good job reprising his role as Agent J, but who really shines is Josh Brolin playing the role of a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones character Agent K. The story here is not anything we haven't seen done before, but it actually works for the most part and the film is entertaining enough to keep your attention for most of the runtime. While there are some very funny moments in the movie, there's also a lot of moments where the humor just falls flat and feels very outdated. The villain in the film also had a lot of potential, but seemed like he was just wasted in the end. The film has a good start and really picks up once the time traveling aspect comes into the film, although there are some parts in the middle of the film where it really drags. I did really enjoy the ending to the film though as it had a really good and heartfelt twist that I thought was a nice way to wrap up the trilogy and was a good payoff.<br/><br/>Overall, Men In Black III isn't a great film or even a memorable one. But, it's fun and works as a popcorn flick and it's worth seeing if you are a fan of the first two films."
"neil-476","9","1","4","1 June 2012"," A film which remembers to be fun
","Boris the Animal (""Just Boris!"") is sprung from prison on the moon to seek revenge against Agent K, who put him there 40 years earlier. This revenge involves going back in time to kill him, which surprises Agent J, who only spoke to him on the phone the night before and then finds the next day that Agent K died 40 years earlier, and so has to go back in time himself to prevent Agent K being killed. The question of how come Agent J remembers Agent K from yesterday when everyone else thinks he died 40 years ago is addressed: I didn't find the explanation very convincing, but that's a minor quibble.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones play Agents J and K again, with Josh Brolin in a superb performance capturing the essence of a young, and less jaundiced and weary, Agent K. The main support players are excellent - Emma Thompson is a very funny Agent O, Jermaine Clement is both vile and funny as Boris, and Michael Stuhlbarg is funny, intriguing and touching as the pivotal Griffin.<br/><br/>Much of the formula from the previous films rightly remains in place - well-realised aliens, dazzling effects, decent action, and good comedy. This is enhanced by the time travel element, poking fun at many aspects of 1969, as well as some fish-out-of-water humour. The relationship between J and K gives the film some heart, and there is some nice payoff material towards the end.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this as much as either of its predecessors."
"tavm","7","1","4","31 May 2012"," Seeing Josh Brolin playing a young Tommy Lee Jones to Will Smith is one of several highlights in Men in Black 3
","I've previously only seen parts of the original Men in Black and don't remember too much of Men in Black II. So it was that I went to watch the latest one with my movie theatre-working friend with not too much expectations. As a result, I thought it was mostly funny if not hilarious the whole way through. Still, it was pretty entertaining especially when Will Smith went back to 1969 to meet Tommy Lee Jones' character as a young man, here played by Josh Brolin in an uncanny impersonation (though both me and my friend also noticed a bit of George W. Bush there). There was also a fine villain portrayed by Jermaine Clement and a reasonably compellingly amusing future-seeing sidekick enacted by Michael Stuhlbarg. I also thought Emma Thompson's part as the new superior was also quite chuckle worthy. Really, all I'll say now is Men in Black 3 is well worth a look."
"chris_molyneaux","8","1","4","31 May 2012"," Exceeded my expectations.
","Stop me if you think you've heard this one before: It's been 10 years since Men in Black II. That one was OK at best but it certainly did not hold a candle to the first, which is still one of my favourite sci-fi films. <br/><br/>I came into Men in Black 3, expecting it to be better than the second one at least. I mean, when it took this long to get to the third film (much like Toy Story 3), it can't be that bad right? Well, it turns out it's much better than that. In fact I'll go as far as saying it's even better than the first!<br/><br/>Now I know what you're thinking, and I agree that it is a stretch. Don't get me wrong, the first movie is a classic, but the things that make MIB 3 good are just stupendously good. So no more comparisons for now, or at least until the conclusion of this review.<br/><br/>The story is what got me the most. A fracture has occurred in the space-time continuum, resulting in Agent K being dead for over forty years. It turns out that an alien criminal named Boris the Animal has escaped from his moon prison, and has time-travelled back to 1969 to kill a younger K before he severs his arm and arrests him. Agent J, who is the only person who still remembers K being alive in the present, goes back just a few days before K was killed in order to stop Boris. The way this plot unfolded, and especially the twists at the end where we see J's father were excellent as well.<br/><br/>The acting is great as always. There's no Rip Torn this time, because his character, Agent Zed, had unfortunately passed away. This resulted in a pretty funny scene where K delivers the eulogy in such a nonchalant fashion. Zed's duties were passed over to Emma Thompson as Agent O, and she makes a great leader. We also have Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, who can not only see the future but everything that can possibly happen in it. He wasn't just a comic relief, but he also served some very important plot points with his special ability. However, the best actor by far was Josh Brolin. I swear, he looked and sounded exactly like a younger Tommy Lee Jones. Not only do we have a great actor here, but also a great impressionist!<br/><br/>The action is fantastic, especially the final battle at Cape Canaveral. I love how the story tied in with the Apollo 11 mission, and that the ArcNet device they attached to the rocket was what saved the world from a possible invasion in the then-future. There are as many hi-tech blasters as you would expect, and there are also some great high-speed vehicle chases. A little disappointed that the little red button was never pushed, but I digress.<br/><br/>In conclusion, MIB 3 is a strong addition to what we can now call a trilogy. The first one will remain a classic in cinematic history, but there's just something about the third movie in a series that gets it right, and sometimes even beats the first, when a very long time is spent in between sequels. If you're a Men in Black fan at all, this is one you can't miss."
"arginnon","7","1","4","31 May 2012"," Josh Brolin is the best
","The first Men in Black movie I saw was the second one. It didn't really impress me, so I didn't rush to see the first one. But as part III was approaching I thought I should check it out and I was surprised, I liked it very much, but I still didn't go into the cinema with hight hopes, but again I had to realize that I was wrong. The movie's not a masterpiece, it won't change your life, but it's fun, and that's what counts. The story was good (I always like good time-travel in films), the action and the effects worked, Will Smith was funny as ever, but Josh Brolin's Tommy Lee Jones impression was the best.<br/><br/>The interactions between J and K were well written and Jemaine Clement did a terrific job as the villain. But sometimes I found the alien elements to be too much. Boris's hand and those spikes he shot out of it were kind of ridiculous, and his motives weren't very clear, but that doesn't take much away from the experience. Also there were some plot-holes and things that weren't explained, but I guess time-travel is hard to write, because it doesn't exist. I don't want to pick this movie apart, so I won't talk about these illogicalities, see them for yourself.<br/><br/>All in all the movie isn't the best, but it isn't bad at all. Enjoyable, funny and brings back nice memories. Oh and the music was really good too (Danny Elfman did the composing).<br/><br/>Score: ★★★★"

","Thankfully there isn't much mumbo-jumbo about time travel that is thrust upon the audience and the focus - as expected - is much more on the camaraderie between Will and Josh. However, and to one's disappointment, it is this very area where the film fails to hold your attention, especially during the second half where neither the drama works, nor the one liners. Oh yes, both Will as well as the ones behind the dialogues and screenplay try hard to inject some humour quotient but frankly, except for a stray four-five points where you do get a smile on your face, there is not even a single 'bring on the laughter' moment.<br/><br/>In such a scenario one would have expected the action to do the talking but even that never rises above the ordinary. Now that's a pity because the film is presented in 3D (seems like a conversion case and not really shot in 3D) but still there aren't any wow moments whatsoever. This means that whether it is the action sequence set in a Chinese restaurant or the one where both agents race on their innovative bike and follow a car, you don't really feel enthralled. Even the climactic sequence set around a rocket launcher station hardly arrests your attention. Men In Black 3 (U/A) 3D-----------------Rating:3/5<br/><br/>It is an Sci-fi action flick.... 3D effects and visual effects were great.... Will smith has done a great job.... the monsters and creatures are very dangerous to be viewed.....<br/><br/>Agent J travels in time to MIB's early years in the 1960s, to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.<br/><br/>Of course the revelation soon after the climax is good and one can join the dots here. Still, the excitement is rather too later in the day because by this time one has actually lost good level of interest in the proceedings. Moreover the culprrit is also some of the repulsive shots in the very first 30 minutes of the film with aliens and their body parts making you look in a different direction.<br/><br/>Yes, Will Smith does well but then he too is saddled with the kind of script that hardly allows him to bring on his characteristic histrionics. Tommy Lee Jones is hardly there, Jemaine Clement is always cartoon-ish and never quite threatening while Josh Brolin is decent, not exceptional.<br/><br/>All in all, a film that you won't regret skipping this season."

It's a well rounded movie with subtle fun facts that bring back memories (after all it's been roughly 10 years since the Mib 2 was released). I couldn't help myself laughing as i heard J say ""may i have your attention please"" as he is pointing the neuralyzer towards a crowd. Great performance by Will Smith and Tommy Lee and a surprisingly good performance in depicting young K by Josh Brolin. There have been discussions whether it is better or not than The Avengers and I must say nothing compares to the atmosphere of Mib and although both are very good movies, i'd give the edge to MIB.

A good setup and some genuinely clever ideas would have worked better without so much forced humor and phony special effects.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","4","26 May 2012"," The story is no masterpiece, but the visuals are astounding . . .
","The great joy of the Men in Black movies can be found in the open-ended ideals of science fiction itself. The series, like the best of the genre, offers the possibilities of new places, new creatures and new ideas to be explored. The original 1997 film had a grand idea: What if there were federal agents working in the shadows to police, monitor and control alien activity here on earth? It was not only a great film but also a showcase for a former rapper-turned-sitcom star named Will Smith whose early scenes were a tour-de-force of comic brilliance. The second film, released five years later, was a disaster. Hardly an hour long, it repeated the formula without a single new idea, or a single laugh.<br/><br/>Men in Black III, I am happy to report, gets the series back on its feet. It is no masterpiece, and it falls short in the belly laughs, but this time it has a meatier story, some breathtaking new special effects and an unexpectedly wonderful comic performance by Josh Brolin. Yes, the movie ends with the standard fight to the finish, but along the way the movie finds some moments of grand brilliance.<br/><br/>The story I must discuss with some degree of spoilers, if you haven't seen the trailer, and would like to be surprised, stop reading now.<br/><br/>The story this time is better than either of the two previous films. It begins at a Super-Max prison on the moon where a master criminal, Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) engineers an escape in order to take his revenge on Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Boris is the last of his species and wants vengeance because long ago, K caused him to lose his arm. That's a bit of a sticky situation because the palm of Boris' right hand is a cavity that contains a large bug that can shoot deadly darts at its victims. Boris is a masterwork of creature design. His whole body, it seems, is a weird construction of finger-like tendrils that open and close voluntarily. His face contains a long row of teeth that seem to be all molars. His eyes are hidden behind a pair of bizarre goggles and only at the end of the movie do we get the unappetizing sight of what Boris is trying to hide.<br/><br/>Boris' mission of vengeance takes him to Earth where he intends to travel back in time and kill the young Agent K in order to, not only get his arm back, but to keep him from building a ray-shield that will protect earth from an invasion by his species. Agent J (Will Smith), to his horror, reports to work only to find that his partner is not only absent but has been dead for 43 years. J's assignment is to travel back in time to prevent Boris from killing his friend. That requires him to climb to the 61st floor of The Chrysler Building and walk out to the end of one of the eagle heads where he has to jump in order to build up enough speed achieve a time warp (apparently there isn't time to procure a DeLorean). The passage of time that J witnesses on the way down is comic gold.<br/><br/>This is where the movie really achieves take-off speed. Back in the world of 1969 (much of which I cannot discuss), J meets the younger version of K (Josh Brolin), who is a little less stone-faced but no less attentive to his duties. Brolin is amazing in the role. He looks and moves and sounds so much like Tommy Lee Jones that you wonder how much he studied Jones for the role. If the performance just came naturally, then he is a better actor than I thought he was. With this performance, I am becoming convinced of what a wonderful actor Brolin is becoming, especially after his performance as George W. Bush in W, Tom Chaney in True Grit and Dan White in Milk.<br/><br/>I was also impressed, in a different way, with the performance of Michael Stuhlbarg (he played the schlemiel in A Serious Man). Stuhlbarg plays Griffin, a spaced-out little man in a plaid hunting cap who has the ability to see all the possible variables of a situation. He is also the possessor of the shield device that Boris is looking for. I was surprised and very touched by the addition of Griffin to the story. He could have been just a standard foil but he is a likable fellow whose sweet face is a picture of pure serenity. He has a moment late in the film when he removes his hat that reveals another special effect that generated, within me, a genuine sense of wonderment.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with little moments of joy, most of which come out of the special effects. Rick Baker's make-up team and the visual effects engineers have created a gallery of brilliantly realized creatures and populated the frame much like the Star Wars films. Not just Boris and Griffin, but also a strange Arabian man whose turban hides a cranium the size of a basketball.<br/><br/>As I said, this is no masterpiece in the story department, but I was glad to see that the movie takes the men in black in a new direction, and adds some touching context to the characters of J and K, but the movie does end with the standard old fight atop a rickety structure. But the reward is what comes in the film's closing passages as the movie reveals something about J and K that we never suspected. It makes you long for what will be explored in the next adventure."

Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg return as director and executive producer respectively, with the amazing Danny Elfman returning as the scorer.

He too travels back in time to save K and kill Boris before he could be imprisoned.<br/><br/>Will Smith returns to acting after a four year break, and he does his usual Will Smith-isms. Tommy Lee also plays his jaded, old, craggy self, with Josh Brolin acting so much like Tommy Lee that had I known better I would have thought it was Tommy Lee Jones with younger makeup. Talking of makeup, Rick Baker's makeup is spectacular. Despite the movie's budget being the first and second film's combined, the aliens are mostly makeup, and it is all great, nice to see a change from the endless flow of CGI that infests Hollywood. The film has some funny moments and some cool action, as well as a side character, Griffin the alien who reminded me of a young Robin Williams. It feels a little dull and original in the first twenty minutes, but the film really picks up after the time travel. Overall, a fun, exciting sci-fi comedy with great effects and a superb Tommy Lee portrayal by Brolin."

His Direction is Outstanding. Because Story is Not Very Great But Still He Manages Audience Movie Watchable Through Comedy n Action Scenes Specially in 3D. Movies Length also Very Good With 1 Hour 45 Minute Movie. From the Whole Cast ""Will Smith"" as Agent J is Top Class. He is a Brilliant Actor n Very Funny in Movie, n Watching Him on Screen After a Long time is Very Fabulous Experience. ""Tommy Lee Jones As Agent K"" is Also Very Good but His Role is Very Small. ""Josh Brolin As Young Agent K"" Also Delivered Good Performance. But The Real Funny Character in the MIB3 is the Villain ""Jemaine Clement As Boris the Animal"" He is d Best in the Movie. His Performance also Spectacular. But Ending is Very Difficult to Understand. Director Confuses us in d Ending by showing Repeated Scenes. Finally My Rating is For MIB 3 is 7 Out of 10.. it's Funny, Action n Simply d Best. Highly Recommended ...! Don't Miss... !"

","The Men from the Top secret Organization are back in this new film called "" Men in Black III"" and I mean Way, , ,back. Directed by Barry Sonnenfel this story was written by Etan Cohen. It seems a dangerous creature called Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped incarceration on a maximum prison planet and has a most diabolic plan to travel back in time to get even with the man who put him in prison. Will Smith returns as Agent J and Tommy Lee Jones reprises his role as Agent K with Josh Brolin playing a younger version of himself. Audience members have to pay close attention to this action oriented, fun-filled caper as the agents have to chase themselves through time, hoping that they can remember enough to save themselves and the world. The movie is exciting in more ways than one. What with super gadgets and speed travel in multiple frames of history to deal with, this movie unravels at the speed of excitement. For eye-candy we are offered Emma Thompson as Agent O and plenty of recoil as the movie progresses. All in all, this is a good film with heart touching scenes as friendship is put on the line. Great comeback for the principals. ****"
"lasttimeisaw","5","1","5","6 June 2012"," Men In Black III
","Saw the film in cinema with a 2D version, after 4 years absence from the screen, Will Smith eventually returns with his most tailor-made MIB suit as Agent J (with his craggier partner, Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K and the director at the helm of the franchise, Barry Sonnenfeld), the third installment keeps flourishing with all kinds of extraterrestrial creatures which serves its purpose to marvel the audience, that is, a chief achievement not only for this film but also for the entire series. <br/><br/>Another requisite component is the wisecrack-gimmicks between J and K, the young Vs. old/ black Vs. white pair scrupulously sparks in the first half until the time travel gizmo operates, a straight-face Josh Brolin as the younger version of K (he is only 29 in the film? Nobody buys that, right?) doesn't register any screen chemistry with Mr. Smith. So with an ambiguous testimony for the sake of time-travel and aliens attack, the film has lost its beacon and the villain (Boris the Animal) is so airheaded and doesn't even has any kick and weight throughout (Boris' revolting kiss with Nicole Scherzinger has forewarned the film's scurrility and slackness) ! <br/><br/>Several passable gags like the O, K quip, a Andy Warhol mockery, Lady Gaga and Ming Yao's glance among the E.T. files are the gist of its integral viability as a summer blockbuster, the visual effects are just too standard compared with any other mega-budget productions. Among the supporting cast, a genie-like Michael Stuhlbarg as the hyper-intellectual Griffin who has a superpower to foresee the future and a M-in-the-room stance from Emma Thompson are indeed scene stealers. <br/><br/>A gimmick of going back to 1969 has its intentionally retrospective charm has a and its plot fabrication with moon-landing also shows some shrewd wit in re-igniting the zeal from the modern-day audience (after all there is a 10 years gap between), but in the very end, especially after a saccharine father-bonding finale, it is only a wishful thinking, I hope at least it could revive Will Smith's screen presence, which should be the minimum favor and purpose of its own genesis."
"The-Sarkologist","6","1","5","5 June 2012"," Surprisingly Good
","I wasn't really sure what to expect of this film, and in fact I was quite surprised to learn that it was coming out when I saw the trailers in the cinema. In a way I rolled my eyes and thought 'gee, not another Men in Black'. I had seen the other two, a long time ago, and in a way had pretty much left the actually knowledge of them sort of filter away. I guess I found the other two movies to be somewhat ordinary and a little silly. While they were comedies, I never actually found them all that funny.<br/><br/>To be honest, I didn't really find this movie all that funny either, but I guess that has a lot to do with American humour. What Americans seem to find funny (and you can easily work that out by seeing what movies they go and see, though the best way would be to go into a cinema in America and watch a comedy, but that is something that I am not really all that keen to do) is not what I find funny. However despite it being not all that funny, and nothing a little too different from the other films, I still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Anyway, one day Agent J walks into the office to discover that Agent K has disappeared, and that was after J discovered that there were some secrets that K has not actually told him. J was a little upset because apparently he was going to be told all of the secrets of the universe, but as it turns out (and he discovers the secret in the end) this secret is not a secret of the universe but rather of a personal nature.<br/><br/>Apart of me was wondering if there was any direct connection with the previous movies, and I guess one always thinks that when one comes in and watches a sequel years after watching the original, but it does come clear that this is not the case. Seriously, some sequels really do do my head in because I am always wondering whether there is something from the previous movies that are important in this movie that I may have forgotten or missed, but as it turns out this is not the case. I guess this is one of the dangers of sequels that people who have not seen the previous films will not see the sequel, however the benefit is that people who have seen the originals, will rush out and rent them to familiarise themselves with what has gone on before so that they are left with no nasty surprises.<br/><br/>Somehow I also wonder whether there was a reason why they took this long to release the third movie, but there could be a lot of reasons. However, this is still a good movie, and I liked it, and no, you don't need to have seen the earlier movies to be able to enjoy this one."
"aharmas","5","1","5","3 June 2012"," If only, if only, the rest of the film matched that ending
","Once again, the previews had the best parts of the movie. We were waiting to see more of that, knowing that the chemistry between Smith and Jones worked well, given the right dialog/scenery. Smith is wonderful at being reactive, and Jones can say so much without saying anything. He has that face people respond, too. The premise of having him disappear sent shivers down the spine because everything would be out of balance, unless we brought him back with just another actor who could do exactly the same thing.<br/><br/>This part works well, but whereas Michael J. Fox does wonders in the three ""Back to The Future"" films, the plot twist is barely developed here, and there are several missed opportunities. Brolin is dead perfect as the young Jones. He actually looks and acts as a biological young version of him.<br/><br/>There is too much talking in the film, and it's not clever, amusing, or entertaining. It just drags and takes the fun out of the conflict, fish out of water storyline. The creative team tries to lessen the damage by adding some more ""amusing"" aliens along the way, a ""future"" reader who is likable but gets a bit tiring pretty soon, and there we encounter more missed opportunities.<br/><br/>The film tries to restore some of its magic in the last fifteen minutes, and this might just a little too late for us. As we do react to the hidden elements of the ""classified"" file. It's a classic and sweet moment which rings true and explains a lot. However it feels like someone else wrote, either as a last minute script remedy, or it was just a piece of the original idea that was never developed enough for the middle section of the film.<br/><br/>One last request to Hollywood: YOU need to give us a GOOD or BAD villain, someone we can count us to entertain us, scare us, make us react and somehow cheer or despise because he/she earns that right, not because we're just supposed to manipulated by the money factory."
"ghost_dog86","6","1","5","2 June 2012"," Pitbull Sucks!
","Written Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland <br/><br/>I waited ten years for this?! This third installment of the beloved (yet seemingly forgotten) ""Men in Black"" franchise reunites not only Will Smith (The Pursuit of Happiness)and Tommy Lee Jones (No Country for Old Men), but also director Barry Sonnenfeld and writer Lowell Cunningham; in a film that leaves much to be desired when held side by side with the original. In fact, for the first forty-five minutes, ""Men in Black 3"" is almost unwatchable, containing relatively no laughs. So, is Will Smith to blame simply because, unlike any film in the series before, ""Men in Black 3"" is pretty much the Will Smith show? Well, the answer to that question is a resounding no. The disappointments here actually stem from not poor script structure, but an abundance of shockingly dull one liners. The sad fact is that Will Smith is given absolutely nothing funny to say for the first half of the film. And, of course, it doesn't help that during the final credits audiences are subjected to that God awful Pitbull song. It isn't until the arrival of Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), nearly half way through, that things with ""Men in Black 3"" become even the slightest bit entertaining. And, as you can probably tell by my rating, this film does get better as the second hour hits its stride. But if what I say is true and only half the movie is worth watching, then shouldn't logic dictate that my admission price be cut in half? The Plot: This third installment follows Agent K (Jones) and (now veteran) Agent J (Smith) as they go about their Men in Black business; you know, protecting the earth from the scum of the universe and zapping people in the eyes with that memory eraser thing. But little do they know that an evil alien, with the very fitting name of Boris The Animal, has just escaped from intergalactic prison, and has the elimination of Agent K on his mind. But he doesn't plan on killing K in the conventional alien way (no probing). Boris plans to go back in time and kill young Agent K. So, when Agent J wakes up one day to find his partner missing, ""to find the truth, he has to do back in time"" (damn you Pitbull!).<br/><br/>There are really only two reasons to watch ""Men in Black 3"": The first being the standout performances of Brolin, who is a shoe-in to one day play Tommy Lee Jones in the Tommy Lee Jones story, and Jemaine Clement (The Flight of the Conchords) who plays the witty and grotesque (best villain of the series) Boris The Animal. The second reason being, for how lackluster and ill conceived the plot of ""Men in Black 3"" seems for about an hour, the twist in the final act is one of the most pleasantly surprising payoffs in any sci-fi movie I have seen since the 90's. I hesitate to say that this ending is so good that it makes up for the rest of this below average film, but...it sort of does.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Men in Black 3"" is a horse that starts the race off slow, but finishes strong. And while I don't see this horse winning any races among critics (and maybe I've just used one too many horse racing analogies for my own good) if you are a fan of the Men in Black series, ""Men in Black 3"" will be something worth wasting a Saturday afternoon watching. On the other hand, if ""Men in Black 2"" was in your mind, ""just OK"", then don't waste your time with this film.<br/><br/>Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

"lambergino","10","1","5","2 June 2012"," Outstanding movie! This is so Genuinely FUNNY!
","Genuinely funny means you don't have to think about or anticipate or expect to laugh as you watch a comical title like this. It is just so hilariously funny with lots of substance and you will most definitely enjoy it like so many others and I have. It is much better either of the last Men in Black. Best watch in 3D as there is lots of action and lots of scenes where outstanding use of 3D technology is presented. There is lots of situations where the characters have to just be themselves and it blends in with the whole plot very well. The transition in the old and young agent K was amazing. There was so much thought put into the detail involved with making these two pre and post characters a delight to compare and contrast. I guarantee you will like it :)"
"ivern-326-711636","8","1","5","1 June 2012"," The Men in Black Return 10 Years After Their Last Movie
","Men in Black 3 is the latest installment in the alien-hunting movie series that started in 1997. It's starring Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin. It's about an evil alien that goes back in time to kill Agent K, erasing him from the present time. Therefore, Agent J travels back a day earlier to stop the alien.<br/><br/>Now, Men in Black 3 got some pretty negative reviews, but personally I liked it very much. I thought the story was fun, the humor was good and the creatures were great. Another thing I liked is the turn the movie takes near the end, which was surprising and very touching.<br/><br/>So you might be wondering, is Men in Black 3 the next Toy Story 3? No, it is (obviously) not. It is however better than the first two films (in my opinion, mind you). I liked the story more and the action scenes were good.<br/><br/>The movie also has a brand new cast of characters. Very few characters from the previous films make a return, which I actually think is good. The new characters are good. We have the villain, Boris the Animal, which is just a really cool and funny villain. We also have a supporting character called Griffin, which can foresee every possible future. He was funny and charming.<br/><br/>Men in Black 3 is not without its flaws. First of all, the lack of Tommy Lee Jones is a bit disappointing. He's just in the movie for about 20 minutes. For the rest of the movie, Agent K is played by Josh Brolin, who plays his younger counterpart. The reason I don't actually mind Tommy not being in the movie too much is because Josh is JUST LIKE HIM! Another flaw is that there are numerous plot holes in the story, which is to be expected from any time travel story, but it's still very noticeable.<br/><br/>Overall, Men in Black 3 is a great way to end the trilogy. Any Men in Black/science-fiction fan should see this one."
"brad_the_metalhead","10","1","5","1 June 2012"," The best in the series
","When I first heard they were making a new Men In Black movie I was extremely exited, then I found out that this one would feature time travel then I was even more exited, and finally after viewing the film I was more than pleased I walked out of the theatre with a smile on my face.<br/><br/>The film sticks to true Men In Black style they are after one particular alien, and this alien was by far the best alien villain in the Men in Black series and definitely the most intelligent in the series, to go back in time to erase Agent K from the future.<br/><br/>I have to be honest, I was a tiny bet worried when I first heard that Josh Brolin would be playing Agent K for most of the movie, but while I was viewing the movie you can hardly notice because Josh Brolin did an amazing job at acting like Tommy Lee Jones, But Tommy Lee Jones don't have too small off a role he still has a fair bit of screen time.<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie were also great they really outdone themselves with this one, it by far has the best effects out off all the Men in Black movies, I also love what they did when Agent J(Will Smith) travels back in time and they actually did a fantastic job at making the background look like the 1960's.<br/><br/>Also, you can't have a Men in Black movie without the comedy, this one does not disappoint when it comes to comedy, this is the funniest one yet. Not only is it funny but this one actually has a very beautiful ending but I'm not going to give it away.<br/><br/>Best Men in Black movie yet, highly recommended."
"domtaylor","6","1","5","31 May 2012"," MIB lll is one great film that you can't miss!
","Men In Black 3 brings back the epicness of the first two movies.Although it has been fifteen years since the first movie, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have kept the quality of their roles and Josh Brolin started his role fantastically also. You would actually think that Josh Brolin would have to be related to Tommy Lee Jones to pull off his role so brilliantly! Men In Black 3 kept me entertained from start to finish and had a variety of comedy and action which is one of the things that makes this a really great movie! Barry Sonnerfield came back with a bang and made this movie as original as the others. This was clevery written and has a great story vouch will hook anyone into this film! Overall,Men In Black 3 is a great movie to see with your family(the IMAX 3D is fantastic on this film by the way)and I would recommend it to be seen on the big screen!"
"Shanetmims","9","1","5","26 May 2012"," Not the sequel I was expecting, but it is a worthy one, for the most part
","Let me get this out of the way:I love Men in Black. I think the first movie is perfect. Very few movies can combine a gripping plot,strong performances,great special effects and makeup,a fun score,creative aliens,and some of the funniest movie moments in any film ever like the first film did. And this all this was accomplished in less than two hours.<br/><br/>The second film was not as strong. I actually thought it was had more good than bad parts in it. I mean, it still had some funny moments,some good effects,the chemistry between the leads was still present,and I like the twist at the end. But let's not kid ourselves:it was pretty repetitive,was not as funny as the first,and had a weak villain to follow up the great villain of the first. Still, I think it is better than is reputation,especially after watching it again recently.<br/><br/>So,when I heard there was a third movie coming,ten years after the second,I was more excited than worried.Come on,they had ten years to make a proper sequel;they wouldn't make an equally entertaining but disappointing sequel like MIB II again. And with each new trailer,I got more and more excited,and after seeing it last night,it was worth the wait,but it was not as good as the first. Why? Read on.<br/><br/>The film picks up ten years after the last film. We open with the introduction of our villain,Boris ""The Animal"",an alien who is escaping a prison on the moon. The last of his kind,and missing his arm due to a previous MIB encounter,Boris is coming to Earth to get revenge on the MIB agent who took said arm:K. Meanwhile,J is at a crossroads at his life,feeling like even after fifteen years,he still doesn't have much of a idea of who his partner really is. After a brief,but brutal encounter with Boris at a Chinese restaurant,K puts him partner on probation to keep him safe from Boris.The next day,when J is coming up to work,he finds himself facing a horrible truth:K is now dead,and apparently has been for forty years! <br/><br/>After discovering why he has not been erased from the time-line(why is kinda clever and funny,so I won't spoil it here)J learns that Boris has gotten hold of a hand-held time travel device and has traveled back to July 16,1969 to kill K, which means K never prevented the invasion of Boris's species by entering a shield into Earth's gravitational field which will protect the entire planet from an alien invasion.Now J must go back in time to July 15,save K,and along with K and an alien named Griffin,who can see pretty much every possible future at once, find a way to get the shield into space so Earth can be saved.<br/><br/>This movie would fail without the chemistry of its three leads,and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones both still have terrific chemistry as J and K,respectively.Hard to believe,ten years later,they still click wonderfully and both are as fun to watch as they were in the first two.Michael Staulburg is a great addition to the cast as Griffin,having some really funny moments with his powers, and his dry delivery. Jemaine Clement is a great villain as Boris,menacing and fun to watch,and his character brings a real sense of darkness this time out.The supporting cast,including Emma Thompson,Alice Eve,Will Arnett,and Bill Hader,are give good performances,with Emma being a real standout.<br/><br/>However,the best performance belongs to Josh Brolin,who nails Tommy Lee Jones' mannerisms and delivers a worthy compliment to Jones's K.It is worth seeing just for him. Very special mention goes to his final scene,which really touched my heart as a fan of this trilogy.You will know what I mean when you see it.<br/><br/>Men in Black has always had cool tech,both from the gadgets and technical achievements from the production design and the makeup,and the standard continues here.The MIB headquarters looks different than the proceeding films,and there are actually are two different variations of it:2012 and 1969.Both are impressive,as is the makeup and computer effects for the aliens. Boris's makeup and computer effects are particularly noteworthy and very impressive. There are new gadgets as well,such as these one wheel bikes that J and K use in a great chase scene,the hand-held time travel device(which was a great effect when utilized)and even jet packs! How awesome! The writing here is much better than two. Scenes lead logically to the next scene and the lead characters' souls remain intact. And the final revelation is a very nice way to further tie the bond between our heroes together even closer than before.<br/><br/>And don't worry:the film is still quite funny.Griffin gets some very funny moments,you get to see the worms sing amazing grace,and Brolin captures Jones's deadpan delivery very well.I particularly like the scene where K is delivering ""SPOILER ALERT"" Zed's(the original MIB chief) eulogy.In typical K fashion,it is very deadpan and very funny.<br/><br/>My problems with the film are these,however:the film does lack the pace and humor of the first.It is the longest of the three,and it felt like it around the beginning of the third act.Also, it lacks the heart of the first,and some scenes don't hit like they should. I hate to bring it up. I have nothing but love for this trilogy,but why is it so hard to outdo the first? It was so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still,I did enjoy it,and my disappointment mostly just comes out of this writer's love for the first. But with some great humor,a smart script,great performances,some fun tech,some wonderful feelings of nostalgia,and a great scene near the end tying the entire trilogy together,MIB 3 is what we should had gotten ten years ago,and this writer is very pleased that the franchise has been redeemed! Check it out!"
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","1","5","27 May 2012"," A far better improvement over MIB 2
","After MIB 2 came out, it seemed like for the longest time that MIB 3 wasn't going to go anywhere. Both movies were treated the same way as the Ghost Busters franchise: the first, everyone liked, and the second just totally faltered and had fewer fans than usual. The first film had a nice intro that brought the audience to grips with its characters and story. However, the sequel didn't bring anything new to the screen. The character roles were just switched and a new villain was inserted and had the same intentions of invading earth. But by comparing this film to the first sequel, the first sequel is nowhere close to this one story wise.<br/><br/>Coming back to the screen is Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as the alien crime-fighting duo. Both actors retain their personalities from the previous films, which is always a good thing. Their mission? To stop a Bogladite named Boris from returning to the past and killing Agent K. If Agent K is killed in the past, a Bogladite invasion will begin on Earth in Agent J's time because there is a certain key that will be missing that allows Earth's protection from a Bogladite invasion. Returning for another run is composer Danny Elfman who provided the music to the last two films. However, the score has a little more guitar in it. I'm not complaining though. The music still sounded great, it just sounded a tad different.<br/><br/>Jemaine Clement plays Boris, which is weird because every time I saw Boris, I saw Tim Curry. I guess because of the way he spoke? I really can't explain it but I felt like I was watching him and not Clement. But all that has to be said for this character is that this is one tough villain. Boris is not just ugly, he's fierce and unforgiving and that's perfect. It was even funnier when the future Boris met with himself from the past; even he wasn't nice to himself. Watching Boris recalled to how the villain from MIB 2 just wasn't good enough. The character of Serleena played by Lara Flynn Boyle just didn't seem make her character mean enough. But this is only one character of the film. <br/><br/>Audiences will find Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, quite an interesting and entertaining character because of his range of probability fortune telling. And then you have Josh Brolin who gives an undeniably excellent performance as playing young Agent K. Brolin's mannerisms, facial expressions and word use show how long Brolin studied the character of Agent K. However, the only thing wasn't pleasing was that some of the characters from the first two movies didn't reprise their roles for this film. But why? These were the characters that helped make the first one a hit and the second a mild hit (for some). A few characters were explained to why they didn't show up, while others were just totally unmentioned. Where was director Barry Sonnenfeld when that happened?<br/><br/>The action, dialog, and sci-fi effects are still great to look at in this film. But the idea of going back in time was an interesting take. It was fun to see what kinds of things MIB used back in the mid 1900s. I got a big laugh when J was about to get an ""eye exam"", compared to what it was like in the first movie. This kind of material shows how ridiculous and over the top MIB was as a growing corporation and it's funny to watch, especially the way J handles the issues. The best thing about this movie though, is the story. The plot explores so much of the two main characters. It explains to why K is K. Even more interesting is how it reaches into the background of J, which is new because MIB 1 & 2 didn't bother to dig into this area before. In the end, I was almost just as satisfied watching this film as to the first. I guess waiting 10 years or so can really turn a franchise around.<br/><br/>Men In Black 3 is far better than MIB 2 because of its in depth story line and how it focuses on its characters from a different perspective. However, it is not as good as the first because it lacks the supporting characters from previous installments. But after watching this second sequel, viewers will understand much more about the MIB duo than the first two films could ever try to explain."
"dannymcdandy","9","1","5","27 May 2012"," A Sequel With Depth
","The first Men In Black Movie was a classic. And let's face it, MIB 2 stinks. But MIB 3 offers something we have yet to see in either of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Depth.<br/><br/>There's a lot more here than witty banter between Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) or Agent J, (Will Smith). The creators are done with making the oddities of the aliens as a major focal point of the story and humor, though there is plenty of it in MIB 3. This time we get to delve into the characters of both Agent K and Agent J, and the result is refreshing.<br/><br/>They do this by time travel. In order to save the life of his partner, Agent J must travel back in time and rescue Young Agent K (Josh Brolin) from Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement). Here we learn a lot about Agent K and how he might have become the hard-nosed stickler for rules that he is.<br/><br/>Being about time-travel, you can expect there to be a lot of twists and turns, and quite frankly a couple of scenes that will blindside you. (But in a good way.) I obviously can't get into specifics because I don't want to give anything away, but there were several moments throughout the movie where I had to ask myself if I was still watching a Men In Black movie. Though it is still classified as a comedy for sure, the elements of action and suspense kept you on the edge of your seat, while the tenderness of some scenes nearly brought me to tears - something I would have never expected from a Men In Black movie.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. Will Smith is at his best, and Tommy Lee Jones is always a delight, but he is only in the movie for twenty or thirty minutes it seemed. I would have to say that the real credit goes to Josh Brolin for portraying Young Agent K. I'm not sure they could have picked a better actor for the job.<br/><br/>Starting out, the movie seems that it was only adding to the poor job done on MIB 2. I went in to this movie thinking that it HAD to be better, because if it wasn't, I don't know why they would even try. (Sorry for those of you out there that really liked MIB 2...Please let me know what I'm missing there.)<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the first two MIB movies, where have you been? But seriously, it would be good for knowing the background of the characters. I would say this one trumps the first two by far.

It is uncanny how well he plays a young Tommy Lee Jones. I was convinced Jones had dubbed his voice, but no so. Mister Brolin did it perfectly. <br/><br/>Second good thing is Smith and Jones back as the perfect couple, and third is a script that was well written and well executed. The filmmakers resisted the temptation to overdo the effects and gadgets, but had a good time with them in the 1969 scenes. Adding to the fun is Jermaine Clement as Boris and Emma Thompson as Agent O, along with Michael Stuberg, Bill Hader and David Rasche.<br/><br/>In addition to the plot, you will learn things about Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, some Chinese restaurants, fashion models, and why you should never flush a goldfish you won at a carnival down a toilet.<br/><br/>This is a great 2 hours to escape and enjoy. ""MIB 3"" gets, appropriately enough, a very good 3 out of Fordyce.<br/><br/>Credit Check: Nothing happens at the end of the credits, so feel free to leave. At the showing I attended more people than usual waited for the end and seemed disappointed. I think we were all hoping for a hint at what's next from the ""Men in Black."""

","The third outing for Men In Black burst onto my cinema screen last night and had me hooked right from the start.<br/><br/>A vastly superior sequel to the second film,( and longer too )this film succeeds in that it is n't just another MIB formulaic outing.<br/><br/>Time-travel needs careful handling in films and here, it makes it necessary to the plot. Josh Brolin stole the show for me though and made a hilarious and well voiced youthful Tommy Lee Jones. Not sure about Emma Thompson's 'age'in relation to Tommy Lee's. And the baddie ...is REALLY BAD.<br/><br/>The twist at the end was very clever and heart rending and had me thinking about it for some while after I had got home."

","With all the wannabe haters out there who bash everything because what Hollywood comes out with does not meet their narrow minded standards, I am happy to report that Men in Black 3 is a return to the original. Okay, so there are no worms or Frankie, but rather an emotional human drama that is sweet, tear jerky and a damn good science fiction film.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is brilliant as young K, and the back story between him and Jay is explained slowly and you will cheer for them both. Frankie, my favorite alien, no longer alive makes sweet cameos and by far and away you will fall in love with the wise Doctor-Who/Luke Skywalker inspiration Griffin, the movie's best alien and the best helpful guide since Yoda.<br/><br/>In between Andy Warhol and some lingering racism, this movie while light years better than the second installment, does not rise to stardom like ""The Empire Strikes Back"". All in all however, a good science fiction bromance is worth seeing. 8 out of 10."

"Diptoman","8","1","6","26 May 2012"," Agents J and K are back, and so is another earth invading force!
","Definitely a huge apology for the mess of a sequel Men In Black 2 was, MIB 3, in my opinion, could even be better than the original MIB. Revolving around a time traveling plot, which usually has a good probability of screwing up, the film pulls it off quite nicely, keeping it really, really simple as far as the time traveling is concerned, avoiding too many paradoxes.<br/><br/>The story revolves round a certain ""Boglodyte"" Boris The Animal, the last of his kind, who Agent J imprisoned 40 years ago, breaking out of a lunar jail to get revenge on J for blasting off his arm and imprisoning him. He decides to take a trip to the past so he can rectify his mistakes that got him caught. Meanwhile, our Agents J and K have a heated argument over the incident concerning Boris, and J refuses to tell K what happened back then with a ""Don't ask questions whose answers you don't want to know"". But before they could go anywhere with this, J simply disappears by the next day, and K finds out that he's been dead for around 40 years, killed by Boris, which implied Boris' plan was successful. So K decides to travel back in time to 1969, to prevent J's death. Perhaps not a jaw-dropping plot, and it does have a few holes here and there, but it's more than enough to keep you seated till the end.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones didn't have much screen time this time, as he had only kind of a secondary role in the film, since it mainly revolved round Agent K (Will Smith) and a ""younger"" Agent J (Josh Brolin). Will Smith, like in the predecessors, serves as a great comic relief, and even if a few of the jokes were clichéd, he was a major driving factor of the film. Josh Brolin performed his role of a merrier, more talkative Agent J almost perfectly, yet to encounter the event (the Boris incident) that changed him completely. The screen chemistry between these two agents was really tangible, and made for a great watch. Another character which needs mention is the Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg), the last of his multi-dimensional seeing kind who could look into the many possible futures, and the second half pretty much revolved round our agents saving his ass, and him saving theirs. Occasionally providing comic relief with his future predictions, he was a delight to watch. Jemaine Clement as Boris The Animal (Really, ""it's JUST Boris!"") did what he was supposed to do, growl, act and talk badass, and growl more.<br/><br/>The CGI effects were impressive, if not ground breaking, and the aliens looked pretty realistic. A complaint I have would be the 3D, it was completely unnecessary for a few aliens popping out of the screen. Even though the film was shot wholly in 3D instead of being converted, it didn't impress much, and seemed pointless (or maybe that's just my usual 3D hate, because having to wear two glasses to watch a film is, well, uncomfortable to the say the least). Action sequences were more or less ordinary, and comprised of the usual shoot 'em up, though I don't have much problem with that, since the rest of the film helps you forget it.<br/><br/>One more thing which I really liked about the film was the scope for character development, and specially the twist in the last few minutes (which would be the most emotional moment in the whole series) contributing heavily to that, to the bond that J and K shared. <br/><br/>And like in all MIB films, we have revelations about famous characters being alien: Mick Jagger being an alien sent to breed with earth women, and also, Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber appear briefly as extra terrestrial life forms in the film (kind of makes sense, really). And then we find Andy Warhol actually being a secret agent working undercover.<br/><br/>Overall, Men In Black 3 is a great entertainer with its fair share of humorous and emotional moments, and I'd recommend it to all fans of the series. Yes, the 2nd installment did disappoint, but this one more than makes up for it. 8/10 from me."
"antoniomagallon90","8","1","6","26 May 2012"," The Men in Black Are Back and They're Better Then Ever
","Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) is head captive at a maximum facility at the Lunar Max Prison, which is located at the moon. With the help of his girlfriend (Nicole Scherzinger), Boris escapes and heads to Earth and vows revenge against Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), who blasted his arm off forty years ago. Meanwhile in New York, Agent K and Agent J (Will Smith) are doing their usual routine, covering up aliens' existence since they're of course the men in black. After having a heating argument with his partner and hearing that his old nemesis escaped prison, Agent K goes home, but something strange happen. He simply disappears. The next day Agent J tries to find his partner, only to be told that he's been dead for forty years. His new boss Agent O (Emma Thompson) notice that J's insatiable craving for chocolate milk to and having headaches can only be one thing, someone has fracture time. So Agent K has to go back in 1969 and save Agent K from getting kill by Boris. Upon arriving in 1969, he meets the younger Agent K (Josh Brolin), who looks different but similar. Oh boy, this is one heck of a trip.<br/><br/>It's been sixteen years since the first Men in Black and most of loves enjoy it and it's been ten years since the sequel and most of us didn't enjoy it. Men In Black III finally hit theaters and I'm happy to say that the film does not disappoint. What's rare is that this is a ""threequel"" that doesn't suck.<br/><br/>Men In Black III plot isn't Oscar worthy, but somehow its told pretty well. The whole time travel thing had been before in other films, but MIB3 is very unique, but it can be a little complicated understanding how time travel works in this film. During production, there were script problems, which lead some confusion in the second act of the film, but overall most of the plot makes sense. What is surprising is that unlike its predecessor, there's one touching moment. Clearly I can't tell you what, but it works somehow.<br/><br/>Will Smith knows his best. He is the primal comic relief. Without him, this film and its predecessor would not been as good. Tommy Lee Jones iswell Tommy Lee Jones. He's good as he get. Sadly he doesn't enough screen time because most of the story takes place in 1969, but still he's good. Josh Brolin stole the shows. His performance is impressive due to the fact that he looks identical to Tommy Lee Jones, in terms of his look and his acting ability. This is Brolin best role of his career so far.<br/><br/>MIB3 delivers good special effects although some creatures look cartoonish at some point. The film was shot in 3D instead being converted unlike other 3D films that have been release. Although I enjoy some creature popping off the screen, in the end it really wasn't necessary to shoot it in 3D. If you like 3D, give it a shot. If you don't like 3D, don't worry about.<br/><br/>Men In Black III is entertaining and funny. The agents are better than ever. If you're a fan and grew up with the franchise, you should see it. If anyone is new to the series, you should check it out as well. B+"
"minman3","9","1","6","25 May 2012"," A Nice Finish with Feeling
","It is a nice story line that ties many things together. It started out a little slow showing us were everyone is and there is a death in MIB. Things pick up after the funeral and keep moving until the end. As a teenager in NY in 1969 it was nice to see footage of the now demolished Shea Statium and the sets of the Apollo 11 launch. There are some surprises that you need to see in the movie that I will not spoil. This is a must see and from my on feelings is this is the end of this franchise. You will see the old and newest ""flashy thingy"". It has some of the old standards with funny aliens with their own personnel quirks. Sit back and enjoy."
"eqan-asif","8","1","6","25 May 2012"," Suffers from my a loose plot, but the major(and minor) actors deliver.
","If I'm allowed to give only one piece of advice to the writers in Hollywood, and for what it's worth, I would say that writers should stay away from time travel. As my proof, I would present to them the MiB 3, a movie that delivered on most accounts but was thoroughly let down because of the loose plot. Time travel has been done well by some movies only because they dwell on it, taking a considerable amount of time to plug the holes and shoring up the loose ends. In this movie, however, time travel is just a convenient plot device another dimension to Agent J and Agent K, both as individuals and as partners. It is especially superfluous when time travel is used as combat strategy in an action sequence. In short, the whole time travel part was thoroughly needless, and flashbacks--or something else--would've done everything the writers intended, but without leaving the more plot holes than a block of Swiss cheese left out in a firing range. <br/><br/>If one can suffer me to dwell on the negatives bit longer, I can relate another major problem with the movie: pacing. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, as Agent J and Agent K, have some actual chemistry, and there some moments that really did get profoundly emotional. It is quite plausible, expected even, that J as K's partner for 14 years would deeply suffer from the loss of his partner. The movie, however, expects us to play out at that emotional drama in our head. During the second and the third acts of the movie, there are scenes that keep pulling at our heartstrings by displaying all the tiny things about K that J missed: eating pie, drinking coffee, listening to country music. Here's when the problem with pacing comes in. Agent J has been barely separated from K for 12 yours! Unless J is a hyper-sensitive, emotionally needy man who cannot go without half a day without pining for his partner like a stricken puppy, he cannot possibly miss K that much. I won't lie and say that I wasn't affected by those very scenes, but at the back of mind, I was relishing those very moments if the movie had managed its time better i.e. if there actually had been a separation between the two agents!<br/><br/>Now, going on to to things that worked: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, and Josh Brolin (as K of 1969) all deliver solid performances. The comedy derived from that man-love relationship is just what you would expect-- and want. There are is an especially great cameo from Bill Hader as Andy Warhol, and there are are numerous other pop culture references creating a certain temporal irony--even racism is light-heatedly (but effectively) tackled. One might wish that the entire movie was comprised of that, but as Prates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides showed us, a series of loosely connected comedic set pieces cannot alone carry the movie. MiB 3 knows this, which is why the majority of the movie revolves around the relationship between J and K, and there is enough serious pathos that makes the comedic moments memorable. <br/><br/>Two characters, the movie's main antagonist, Jemaine Clement as Boris the Animal, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, a fifth dimension being who can perceive an infinite number of realities simultaneously, are two characters that add little to nothing from the movie. They don't necessarily hurt the movie, but if their characters were tweaked a bit-- or in Griffin's case, not added at all--would've have movie all the much better. Boris is an archetypal villain. He is without any remorse or compassion, he carries out assassinations ruthlessly (although he is quite incompetent when it comes to killing an MiB agents), and has a burning desire for vengeance. For all his faults, there aren't any redeemable qualities that emotionally manipulate us at his eventual downfall, but he isn't also quite evil enough that we wish his death with a passion. He's sort of there simply to move the story forward. Most of time he assassinates aliens off-screen, and forgive me for this, but it's hard to sympathize with aliens. A slightly evil Boris, or a slightly less evil Boris would've been better than the cookie cutter Boris that we have in the movie.<br/><br/>Any amount of time that Griffin gets on screen is an absolute waste of time. I know it's hard not to deliver some philosophical perspective when the very secrets of the entire universe are at stake, but pseudo- philosophical perspective delivered by Griffin is very much bland and unimaginative. In the hopes of appearing existential, Griffin spouts a lot of nonsense that you just have take on its face value because there is nothing deeper within. a) When there is an inter-dimensional being who alone has the key to stopping a genocidal race of aliens, why wouldn't it use it on his own plant? b) Why is the physical presence of a ""fifth dimensional"" being is so important, and why can it be hurt physically when the creature is metaphysical? c) It could very well be irony, but why is the favorite moment in human history of this preternatural being a goddamn baseball game? No matter how much the movie tries to explain this last point, a baseball game--or any sporting event for that matter--seems for too trivial in about 7,000 years of human civilization.<br/><br/>For all the faults that I've mentioned, I gave the movie a score of 8. I chose to dwell on the things that didn't work because there was an agonizing amount of potential in this movie that was all wasted. There was a lot of thought that went into the movie to create the relationship between J and K, the main plot, however, could have been procedurally generated by an algorithm: cookie-cutter villain, convenient plot device, and some pseudo-philosophy to make the movie look deep."
"Anurag-Shetty","8","1","7","2 June 2012"," Awesome movie with incredible special effects that look even better in 3D!
","Men in Black III continues with the adventures of Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones) & Agent J(Will Smith) who are part of the secret government agency known as the Men in Black. The Men in Black mainly protect the Earth from deadly aliens all over the universe that somehow find their way to Earth. K's arch enemy Boris The Animal(Jermaine Clement) who is an alien, escapes from his prison, which is on the moon. He swears revenge on K for chopping off his hand. So, Boris goes back to the past using a time jump time machine & kills a younger Agent K(Josh Brolin) which means that he ceases to exist in the present. J is baffled by K's disappearance. He asks Agent O(Emma Thompson) as to where K is & she tells him that K's been dead for 40 years. Now, it's J's job to go back to the past using the same time machine Boris used & save his partner.<br/><br/>To be honest, I haven't watched Men in Black I & II. Fortunately for me, you can watch the third one without watching the first two and you can still understand what's going on for the most part. Since I haven't watched I & II, I don't know much about the great chemistry shared between Tommy Lee Jones & Will Smith. However, whatever little I've seen of it, it's absolutely spot on. This is mainly because of their differing personalities and attitudes. While J is a happy go lucky agent who destroys aliens with a smile and also manages to wise crack every now & then, K is a serious agent who always has a grim expression on his face(most of the time at least). This has been brilliantly done by Josh Brolin who plays a younger K. The facial expressions, the accent, the tone, and the soft interior as opposed to the hard exterior has been perfected by Brolin. MIB 3 is mainly about the back in time to save the future sorta thing & how J travels back in time to save K's life. So, this third addition is mainly about the chemistry between Josh Brolin & Will Smith. Do they pull it off? Yes! Brolin & Smith share the same magical chemistry that Jones & Smith share. In fact it's hard to believe the younger K is not played by Jones himself. Brolin is that spot on as K. A note on the performances. Will Smith is outstanding as Agent J. Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant as Agent K(though he has limited screen time). Josh Brolin is spectacular as a younger & more fun Agent K. He perfects K so well that, the viewer doesn't miss Jones even for a second when Brolin is playing K. The aliens are innovative & creative as always in an MIB flick. The variety of aliens & their differing appearances is jaw dropping & awe inspiring. The gadgets are slicker & cooler than they were in the first two films. The 3D really enhances the visuals & special effects of the movie. It has been used intelligently throughout the movie. MIB 3 is worth a watch, especially in 3D!"

"mkm-hermanjnr","8","0","1","1 June 2019"," A worthy sequel to the great first movie
","Having finally got around to watching MiB 3 I must admit that I really enjoyed it - and I'm also very surprised at the amount of hate it seems to have garnered on here.<br/><br/>Some of the most highly rated very negative views seem to have been posted for some extremely puzzling reasons. Someone got 50 ""helpful"" ratings for giving the movie 3/10 because the cinema overcharged them, which just makes my mind boggle in all honesty. It's not the director's fault you paid £10 for a ticket in a specific cinema...!<br/><br/>Anyway, in my opinion MiB 3 is the great movie the dismal MiB 2 should have been. Gone are the cringe-inducing failures of wacky try-hard slapstick the second movie tried to pass off as comedy, and instead we have taut references to the first movie, a tight plot and solid humour throughout.<br/><br/>The banter and chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith is as fun as ever, and Jemaine Clement (of Flight of the Conchords fame) makes a great turn as sociopathic alien Boris ""the Animal"", a villain just as goofy and perhaps even more sinister than Edgar in the first movie.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the new character Griffin, played by Michael Stuhlbarg. A slightly neurotic benevolent alien who can see every possible past and future, Griffin adds a gentle element of comedy and kindness to the darker and more violent edge the rest of the film holds. Boris is perhaps the most ruthless enemy the duo have faced, and Griff balances this out.<br/><br/>In fact, I think my favourite thing about MiB 3 is the the amount of heart it has, just like the first movie. It's got plenty of laughs (many small ones, a few big ones) but it's clear it *cares* about the mythos and the franchise. It's not just a cash-in or a mindless laugh-athon.<br/><br/>The ending of MiB 1, in which K notes the beauty of the stars and prepares to have his memory of his career wiped is still hauntingly poignant to this day.<br/><br/>Instead of trying to clumsily ape or surpass that emotional swell, MiB 3 cleverly amplifies it with a neat twist that not only tugs at the heartstrings right at the end of the film, but also makes the first movie even better. It's rare that a sequel can re-contextualise a previous movie and make us like the characters even more, but MiB 3 pulls it off smoothly.<br/><br/>I've also seen a lot of people complain that this film is ""dumb comedy"" but I think that does it a pretty heavy injustice. I actually thought the script was pretty sharp-edged and smart.<br/><br/>There are no gaping plot holes (which for a time travel film is impressive), the jokes are entertaining (people saying the film is politically incorrect clearly missed the sarcasm and brief commentary on racism in 1969). Questions like ""Why can Boris breathe in space?"" are answered by...Boris is *an alien*. We literally have no idea whether he even needs to breathe or not. He's made of gross wormy stuff. Who knows?<br/><br/>To conclude, I'm giving this 8/10. It felt like I was watching the MiB I know and love from the first movie again and combined genuinely funny humour with some emotional heft too. I think this movie is underrated."

","When Boris The Animal (Clement) escapes from a supermax prison on the moon, he swears vengeance on Agent K (Jones), the man in black who put him away. Travelling back in time, he erases K from history, forcing his partner, J (Smith), to head into the past in hot pursuit. There, he teams up with a younger K (Brolin)...
In a summer dominated by men in capes, spare a thought for the men in black. Despite the presence of Will Smith, the de facto biggest movie star in the world (albeit headlining a movie for the first time since 2008), the third Men In Black film has struggled for attention. Perhaps it's because it's been ten years since we last saw Smith's Agent J and Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K strut their stuff, or perhaps it's because Men In Black II was - a couple of genius gags aside - utter rubbish, but it's been hard to muster much enthusiasm. The only MIB-related trailer that generated excitement was the multi-storey monster Smith parked on the New York set.<br/><br/>The film's troubled shoot hasn't helped. A decade in development, MIB3 still started shooting without a finished script, and had to shut down midway through production so that returning director Barry Sonnenfeld, Smith - who came up with the time-travel idea - and a cadre of high-powered writers could resolve a plot that was threatening to tie itself in knots.<br/><br/>Their time might have been better spent punching up the frankly dreadful opening, in which Jemaine Clement's Boris The Animal - a snarling, Brit-accented almost-literal Hell's Angel who kills his victims by firing bits of sharpened bone - escapes from his lunar prison with the help of, of all people, Lewis Hamilton's girlfriend. There are a few stabs here at the mordant humour that defined the first two films, but clearly Sonnenfeld felt that a credible threat to J, K and the rest of the alphabet gang was required - and the truly menacing Boris ticks that box. However, the casting of Flight Of The Conchords' Clement - virtually unrecognisable under Rick Baker's goop - is a curious one, given that Boris isn't required to be funny. One Clement ad-lib, during an exchange with two tourists, aside, you quickly yearn for the shuffling weirdness of Vincent D'Onofrio's Edgar-bug from the original.<br/><br/>As the first 15 minutes wears on, D'Onofrio is not the only thing you'll miss. Following his much-publicised off-screen travails, Rip Torn's Zed is dead, baby, given an early eulogy which allows Emma Thompson, replacing him as Agent O, a cracking comedic moment, but what's mostly gone AWOL is the chemistry between Smith and Jones. At first glance, when the film's plot was made public, it seemed an act of madness to scrunch up the golden ticket and separate the Men In Black, but it's actually a boon for the film. Jones, whose screen time amounts to around 15 minutes, looks tired, and while the film plays nicely on that, there's no excuse for Smith looking sleepy too, or their banter feeling so forced and drained of life.<br/><br/>K's disappearance without a trace - only J remembers he ever existed, which is the first don't-go-there plot development - forces Smith back in time in pursuit of Boris, and there the film kicks into gear. Not just because we get to meet Josh Brolin, giving the film's best turn with a spot-on impression of Jones, but because Will Smith gets to be Will Smith again. Gone is the mopester of the first act, back is the smooth-talking wisecracker with a nice line in incredulous reaction shots when confronted with oversized '60s MIB technology (a neuralizer the size of a small bus). A scene between him and a pair of knuckleheaded cops is the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>But it's still something of a too-many-cooks muddle. Sonnenfeld's insistence on keeping his movies short and sweet (he misses his usual self-imposed 90-minute mark here by a few minutes) is admirable, but means that certain characters are given short shrift (spare a thought for Alice Eve as the young Emma Thompson, who winds up as nothing more than an impressive hairdo that occasionally speaks). And an ill-conceived third act shift from the epic cosmic jokes of the first two movies, which repeatedly rammed home the point that not only are we not alone in the universe, but we're infinitesimally insignificant, to a cack-handed attempt at wringing pathos and genuine emotion from a franchise which was founded on cynicism, just doesn't work. In fact, there's a disheartening lack of wit throughout - thankfully there's just enough zest in certain scenes (a sequence at Andy Warhol's Factory is excellent) to make the possibility of a MIB4 (perhaps with Brolin coming to the future to team with Smith and Jones) relatively palatable. In about 20 years' time,obviously.
Despite some good moments, Agents J, O and K are missing an E."

Somehow off putting was the striking portrayal of violence at the beginning of the movie and Tommy Lee Jone's appearance at the beginning of the movie that seemed strikingly older and weathered, and in some ways tired performance which after the first scene picked up greatly into his smooth Agent K. Emma Thompson, as Agent O for all of her star charisma seemed somewhat underdeveloped and under-scripted, an opportunity lost.

","Men In Black 3 (2012)<br/><br/>Will Smith took an unheard of 4 years off (something he had never done before) after Seven Pounds, to help promote his children in show business. His daughter had a hit single with Whip My Hair and his son Jaden started in the remake of The Karate Kid and dabbled in music too. When he returned to the big screen, he played it safe and went with a sequel to one of his biggest hits. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Agent J (Smith) travels in time to M.I.B.'s early days in 1969 to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.<br/><br/>4 years is a long time between movies for an actor, and it's pretty much like American audiences didn't really care when he returned. Even in a big budget sequel, he couldn't crack the top 10. It is the highest grossing entry in the MIB series globally though.<br/><br/>Personally this is my favourite Men In Black movie, it's vastly superior to the second and more touching than the first. Josh Brolin totally steals the show as a young Tommy Lee Jones, who doesn't really have much to do. I'm not sure why Nicole Scherzinger was hired, what is nothing more than a cameo and some close ups of her boobs. Another nice performance for me was Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Griffin in what can only be described as a Robin Williams esque performance.

","Sequels are rarely as successful as their originals let alone better. Only a handful of sequels have been critically acclaimed. <br/><br/>Most moviegoers of my generation have considered Men In Black to be a classic. And fans were generally underwhelmed by the sequel. Ten years later, a second sequel was made and it blows the first sequel out of the water.<br/><br/>The time travel premise was intriguing. We get to learn about Agent K's backstory a little bit as it took place during one of the most significant moments in human history, the moon landing. Josh Brolin did an exceptional performance as a young Agent K. He nailed the personality and mannerisms perfectly. <br/><br/>Like the bug in the first movie, the villain here is very entertaining, although he has a more debonair, but equally repulsive character. He is arguably the most interesting villain in the Men In Black films. The supporting character, Griffin, adds heart to the film and is the most endearing characters that has appeared in the trilogy.<br/><br/>It would be criminal not to mention Will Smith's performance; Hilarious, witty, and awesome as always. Although the main attraction, in my opinion, is the young Agent K, Will delivers snappy dialogue in just about every scene he's in. Like when he's trying to coach K on delivering a sincere eulogy. <br/><br/>The build up to the climax is very exciting and thrilling. More so than the original.

It felt like exactly what a good sequel ought to be - character development for familiar faces, entertaining new characters, and above all recapturing the atmosphere of the original. This film did a fantastic job of telling an engaging new story, which did a good job of balancing the funny, the dramatic and the emotional, with a fine sense of ludicrous fun which paid homage to the original whilst maintaining its own independent feel. The story is not a mind-blowing narrative, but it's wacky enough to leave you satisfied, and its hilarious yet menacing antagonist drives the story to its surprisingly poignant conclusion.

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","0","2","23 January 2017"," Do not remember the past: it is traumatic
","The general idea is a prodigy of simplicity: to turn a whole set of successful science-fiction dramas or romances or adventures into a full-blown comedy and make all these frightening things that make you dream of a world that will never exist like in Star Wars or in Star Trek hilariously funny so that the audience just never stops laughing. Steven Spielberg adds to that a direct allusion to Back to the future but within the science fiction space adventure genre and it becomes phony more than funny, with me grown up meeting me four years old.<br/><br/>The first two films are really funny because they remain within one layer of time. The third one becomes something different, nostalgic, sentimental even, and that breaks the fun to turn it into fear: the fear the negated past or the traumatized past may turn the future which is our present into a nightmare, a PTSS case of time travel trauma, something like PTTTSS, Post Time Travel Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Welcome to the asylum for deeply disturbed minds and brains.<br/><br/>The most attractive and fascinating aspect is the phenomenal palette and variety of extra-terrestrials you are navigating among. Obviously all of them are just the figment of the imaginations of a band of deranged probably young people generally called artists though there might be a few older ones who are more perverse than deranged, or perversely corrugated. You cannot find them serious. They are all of them just impossible mixtures of all kinds of living gadgets, except in the last one where one of them is well hidden in a human body and is deadly frightening, not funny at all. <br/><br/>The next element that is striking is the role of the Black man in black, just recruited in the first film, trained and excellently performing and competent in the second film and growing melancholy and sentimental in the last film when he sees himself when he was four, when his father was killed under his adult eyes and when with a magic flash the little boy will only remember his father was a hero. And of course it is his partner who erases the truth from the little boy's memory, the partner he meets again in the present some seconds later at the end of the film. That episode brings the saga to an end because the fun has been drunk right down to the tea leaves at the bottom of the cup.<br/><br/>We all, absolutely all of us, have rebuilt the image of the father we had, in pink or in black, in celestial blue or in fiery red, but what we remember of our father is nothing but a mental reconstruction, a Lego reconstruction. All the pieces are true, real and absolutely precise, but the pieces have been reassembled in any creative or traumatic way and that's the image we have of the man we call our father. That's normal. That's natural. That's the truth if there is one under the sun. Our memory is selective. In fact, we remember everything without fault but our conscious memory is the Lego construction I have just spoken of. <br/><br/>You may have in some drawer, or in your pocket, something that is attached to your father in a way or another and that reached you when you were three or four. This thing is attached to you and you are attached to it in an unbreakable union and yet you don't really know why you're attached to it and it is attached to you. It might be a sentence that comes back regularly and that makes you sick with fear or happy with instant bliss, and yet you do not know where it comes from, except that it comes from a long, long time ago and you still have it in your mind because it was a positive or negative trauma, and, mind you, there are positive happy traumas that have the same power as negative ones, except that this power makes you excel and not run away and hide under your bed.<br/><br/>If you want to have some fun in an environment of extraterrestrial monsters, with some dangerous situations and beings and many happy just in time right in time epiphanies and salvations, you have to let yourself slide into these hairy and over-twisted stories and forget about your bills and the fact that the heating does not work. You'll survive since these crazy characters did survive.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Greetings Movie Lovers and Movie Makers! This month we will be discussing ""Men in Black 3"" of course you can't talk about a sequel without talking about the one that started it all. So let's travel back in time! (Fitting isn't it?) Back to a simpler era, Back in the day when things when things where less complicated, and our modems where loud and obnoxious 1997! ""Men in Black"" was out in the theaters and we loved every minute of it! Why? Because it was new and fresh, it was sci-fi and comedy, it had gadgets and special effects that where not over the top, it had a bit of the new world (CGI) and a bit of the old world (Rick Baker) but of course you can't forget, the movie was pining together two of our favorite actors Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. We had fun watching it! Until we saw ""Men in Black 2"" (2002) well, things got a little weird, the love interest from the first movie was gone and a new love interest was introduced who at the end of the movie was well, gone! And it left us with a weird feeling of abandonment, the two movies felt a bit unfinished. Of course we didn't feel this stronger than when we heard about ""Men in Black 3"" and then to hear all of the behind the scenes fiasco that where occurring with the production of the film, (They have no ending, its being rewritten by Will Smith, etc. etc.) Let's get to the point! Jack the ""The Film Lover"" says... ""Men in Black 3"" was FUN! It was a good ride! It had the best villain out of the three films and dare I say it? The best MIB so far. Even though you changed the recipe and replaced actors and took out some familiar ones. I loved it But how? and why? Well to answer these questions here is Jack ""The Filmmaker"" when making a sequel you need to remember your audience. They are coming back to see the continuing story of your hero (In this case Heroes) you want to see what they are up to again, and see them get into and out of the same jams as they did before! and well maybe a couple of new ones. But remember like a great recipe for a good meal you need to change things up a bit for the next time your guests visit, maybe a new diner set or a new side dish or wine to go along with the main course. How about a new actor? Or a new era in time! And how do you do all of that successfully? ""MIB 3"" did it! Tommy Lee Jones was replaced with Josh Brolin for most of the film and even though this was a risky move, he pulled it off and it's actually not that noticeable. When dealing with Time Travel you need to remember the holly trilogy ""Back to The Future"" like an ex-girlfriend we hold everyone else up to her standard! And BTTF is no different. The basic principal to follow when making a time travel movie? KEEP IT SIMPLE! Set the rules and follow them, that's it, MIB 3 did it just right. Of course I'm not about to give you any spoilers that the trailer already revealed but let's talk about the premise, ""Go back in time to save your friend"". The film goes from saving the world like all the others before to a very personal matter, which adds to the edge of your seat excitement. And like a great ""Part 3"" it brings you back full circle to the first film at the end. Boris was a real threat with secrets of his own. His weapons where original and his threat was high! the movie on the whole has it all, action, adventure, fun, excitement, sci –fi and above all heart! A movie without heart is just flash and boom and who cares about flash and boom unless you have a reason for it. Oh and Jack ""The Parent"" says take the kids but have a talk with them about what Special Effects are and that the weird aliens in the movie are not real, there are some things in it that could give a kid nightmares, so far my 4, 8 and 9 year old loved it! Till next time folks this is Jack, signing off!"

","This, the final 'Men in Black' film, opens with a jail break; it involves no ordinary prisoner and no ordinary prison Boris the Animal, a Boglodite, has been incarcerated in a Super-Max prison on the moon for forty years and he now wants his revenge on the man who put him there Agent K. Once back on Earth he unsuccessfully attacks K. Agent J asks him about Boris but he doesn't want to talk about it and all the files are highly classified. He does eventually learn that K stopped Boris at Cape Canaveral and the day of the Apollo XI launch and saved the planet by deploying a device known as the 'ArcNet'.<br/><br/>Boris hasn't given up his plan for revenge and travels back in time the next day Agent J is the only person for remembers K. History has been changed; this time Boris killed K and ArcNet wasn't deployed. Now the Boglodites are about to destroy Earth. Agent Jay must travel back in time to save his former partner and help stop Boris. It won't be easy though; nobody in 1969 knows Agent J and the world then was rather different to that in 2012.<br/><br/>This film is a solid conclusion to the Men in Black trilogy. It opens well with an exciting jailbreak; this introduces Boris well as it shows us how dangerous he is. The time travel plot is fun; I particularly liked how most of the aliens in 1969 looked like men in costumes rather than the CGI aliens of 2012 just like typical sci-fi of the time! There were plenty of good gags; perhaps the best being when they meet Andy Warhol I was expecting the obvious gag about him really being an alien but this was brilliantly dodged by having him be an undercover Man in Black. The final confrontation between Agents J and K and the two Borises (the one from 2012 and the original 1969 one) was exciting and having it take place at the Apollo XI launch was rather fun. The ending was a bit twee but not enough to spoil the story in fact I'm sure many viewers will really like it. Will Smith does a fine job as Agent J and Tommy Lee Jones is fun as the taciturn 2012 Agent K. Josh Brolin is a welcome addition as 1969 Agent K and Jemaine Clement makes a good bad guy as Boris. Sadly 'Frank the Pug' doesn't even get a mention in this film which is a pity as he was one of the funniest characters in the previous film. Overall this was a fun conclusion to the trilogy."

However I think that this film is different from other movies which treats time travel. In other movies, when characters goes to the past, they often goes by an year unit. On the other hands, Will Smith can goes to the past by a minute unit. I think it is too convenient. I was disappointed in this point. But I like the story line.

","Although I didn't think that Men in Black 3 was as good as the first, it was undoubtedly better than the second. Watching it I was reminded of what I loved about the first one. Let me quickly summarize it. The film is about Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement), a terrorist who escapes from the Lunar Maximum Security Prison on the Moon, with intent to go back in time to 1969 and kill the man who sent him there, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Meanwhile back in 2012, Agent J (Will Smith) is wondering where K went as he is the only one who remembers K's existence in the alternate time line. J also travels back in time to 1969 to kill Boris and save K. Immediately a better and more innovative plot for a MIB sequel then the second. Not to mention the wise cracks, the jokes, and the little things about it just add to the fun. If you haven't seen it yet, go check it out. It's a fun and creative sequel to the first fun and creative MIB."
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","3","23 December 2015"," Well, it's a big improvement over the last
","I saw the first MEN IN BLACK in cinemas in 1997 and thought it was okay for what it was (a light, CGI comic book-style adventure). I recently watched the sequel and thought it was pitiful, a tired retread full of awful special effects. Thankfully this third film breathes new life into the series by adding a nice time travel plot and shaking things up a bit.<br/><br/>Will Smith is less annoying than usual in his starring role here and the film works pretty well with him as the lead. The culture shock stuff of him arriving in the 1960s is what makes the movie fun, and Josh Brolin does a nice impersonation of the stiff Tommy Lee Jones. There are still some dodgy CGI effects in here, particularly the whole of the climax which seems to have been green-screened, but they're nowhere near as poor as in the last film.<br/><br/>Once again I didn't care for the villain of choice, Boris the Animal, played by an overacting Jemaine Clement. For some reason these films always have the make the villain either gross or sort-of funny, or both; it doesn't work. Boris is better than the Lara Flynn Boyle monstrosity, but not by much. However, we do get a large supporting turn from the excellent Michael Stuhlbarg, who's the best thing in the film and who automatically lifts the enjoyment level a bit by his presence alone."

","Men in Black 3 (2012): Dir: Barry Sonnenfeld / Cast: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Jemaine Clement, Emma Thompson: Director Barry Sonnenfeld does a great job at taking what began effectively fifteen years ago and creates a wonderful third act twist that delivers why Agent K recruited Agent J. Boris the Animal escapes from his prison on the moon and seeks revenge on Agent K who was responsible for blasting his arm off. Boris plans to reverse time to 1969 and kill Agent Kay. When this occurs, Agent J sets out to correct the problem thus going back to 1969 to save Agent K and kill Boris twice. The special effects are every bit as creative and amusing as they were in the original film, and the humour and dialogue is still witty and fun. Will Smith as Agent J learns much of his partner and risks much to maintain his stature in currency. Tommy Lee Jones plays the stone face Agent K who regrets not terminating Boris, and awaits his destiny to correct the situation. Josh Brolin delivers the best performance as young Agent K in 1969 and his impersonation of Jones and interaction with Smith were spot on perfect and also lead to a touching revelation. Jemaine Clement does a tremendous job as Boris who is bent on revenge and world dominance. Emma Thompson appears as the head of operations when things apparently go astray. While the first film was visually creative entertainment, this third film manages to be just as fun in its screenplay and takes this pointless extravaganza to a satisfying third wheel. We even get a monstrous guppy that was likely never seen in any pet store. Score: 7 / 10"

","I was young when the first Men in black hit the big screen, and I loved it. It was fast, funny, action-filled, lots of cool stuff, good CGI, it took me, and the world, by storm!<br/><br/>Then some years later the second one came, and it was kind of a disappointment. The ending was crappy. And the series died.. For a while. But then! Men in Black 3! Suddenly!<br/><br/>And you know, I was really entertained through out the whole thing, pretty much. I love that both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles, and Josh Brolin is an excellent addition. I guess it has to be said that when a movie has time travel, I'm pretty much sold. At least it really helps. I just love time travel. Love it.<br/><br/>But the action in this is really good. Will Smith is just the right amount of Will Smith. It's very nicely paced, not too long, I just think they did it right with this one.<br/><br/>It does not reinvent the wheel or gun powder, but no movie ever does, and when people think movies do, they don't really. And it doesn't matter if we've seen stuff before, as long as it is done well. And this is just entertaining.<br/><br/>I know I totally overuse the word entertaining in my reviews, but hey, entertainment is what I am looking for in a movie. In my opinion if a movie is entertaining, it is good. I'll give it a good rating.<br/><br/>Men In Black 3 has that feeling of a late nineties movie."

","(63%) A vast improvement over the lazy, tired second entry, that if anything is as good as the 1990's original, making this was one of the more surprising sci-fi hits of the year. Unlike the last movie Frank the talking dog doesn't over dominate the screen time, the ideas are sharper, and adding Josh Brolin is never a bad thing, particularly as he does such a good Tommy Lee Jones impersonation. It's certainly funny enough, entertaining throughout and there's plenty of nice touches for this to be worth getting back into the once dead looking series. And although it maybe won't live very long in the memory, it is still a fun, if a little bumpy ride."
"williampsamuel","8","0","2","6 January 2015"," After all These Years They've Still Got It
","Fifteen years ago Men in Black introduced us to agent's J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) of the Men in Black, a secret organization tasked with monitoring and policing alien life on earth, and keeping knowledge of it from the population at large. It was original, action packed, and oft hilarious. Five years after that came the sequel, which although having its moments was nothing to write home about. Now after a decade comes the third entry in the franchise, which exceeds not only expectations, but perhaps the original Men in Black as well.<br/><br/>One of the better parts in the overall lackluster Men in Black II was that we got to delve, however briefly, into K's past. This time round, we don't just get flashbacks to his earlier adventures; we get to go there thanks to the magic of time travel. Because when Boris the Animal, one of K's deadliest enemies, busts out of prison and goes back in time to kill K and prevent his incarceration, the only hope of saving the earth and setting the timeline right is for J to 'time jump' back to 1969 and prevent his partner's murder. Once there, he finds that young agent K (Josh Brolin) is a completely different man from the one he knew, and that they'll be facing not one, but two Boris the Animals.<br/><br/>First off, I just want to say that Brolin's imitation of Tommy Lee Jones is downright uncanny. His speech, his mannerisms, even the way he walks and shoots are nearly identical to the older actor's. I imagine that Brolin must have spent hours watching Jones' performances in the previous MIB films. The only major difference between their versions of the character (aside from the age gap) is that the younger K is more open, more upbeat, and seems to enjoy life more. At several points J asks ""What on earth happened to you man?"" to which K can only reply ""Don't know, hasn't happened yet."" The filmmakers must have had lots of fun with the retro elements of this movie. The hippies are worth a few laughs, as is the 1969 version of MIB headquarters, with the rows of typewriters, miniskirt wearing secretaries, and massive early versions of their modern gadgets. Even funnier is what happens when J is pulled over by a pair of New Jersey cops. Now I understand that the racial shtick can often be tiresome, or even offensive, but in this case the pay-off is golden, not least because the officers were partly right about J. I also enjoyed the brief references to Lady Gaga and Mick Jagger, and the 'truth' about Andy Warhol is pure genius.<br/><br/>I sorely missed the presence of Frank the Pug, but I must admit that their new sidekick Griffin is really something else. He's a bit goofy, extremely nervous, and very much on the talkative side. His race experiences all possible futures at once, which is pretty handy, but also something of a drag since many of them don't end well and you can't always tell which will come to pass. And Griffin has plenty to be nervous about, what with Boris the Animal coming for him.<br/><br/>And what really makes Men in Black III worthwhile is the ending. It's suspenseful, has great action, and puts an interesting new twist on the Apollo program. But best of all is the human drama. When the revelation comes of what made K the way is, it was highly touching and completely unexpected. More thought went into this scene alone than most Hollywood shoot-em-ups.<br/><br/>Men in Black III is a solid action flick and comedy, with a surprisingly complex story and more character development than your average summer blockbuster. I would consider it equal to, if not better than, the original. If only they'd had the talking dog it would have been perfect."

","This movie needed some work. It should have spent more time with Borris the Animal, gone more in depth with the '69 culture, J & His early love interests' relationship and a little bit more with Will and Josh's relationship. More work should have taken place on the jokes that took place during the early part of the film as well (they weren't bad, just not exactly laugh out loud material.) This film should've been a little bit longer. having said that, I still found this film rather enjoyable and like most people I really enjoyed Josh Brolin's performance. This is a good movie (barely) and not an excellent one. It is possible that one will forget about this movie not too long after seeing it.<br/><br/>P.S. The 3D wasn't bad but it didn't really add to the film either."

The chemistry is just different. The story works well and it has great flow. It is a compelling watch. It continues with the same style. It feels like more of the same which is mostly a good thing. Will Smith is truly in charge of this franchise. And this is his movie all the way. The controversy over Chinese interference doesn't really affect it too much."
"mike48128","9","0","1","1 August 2013"," An original sequel with great performances by all
","A worthy sequel in the series, but nothing beats the ground-breaking first MIB movie! With obvious homage to both ""Back to the Future"" and the ""Mad Max"" movies, it has big shoes to fill. James Brolin as the young ""K"" is absolutely amazing. More of the same with a twist, of course: There's always a monstrous alien villain who wants to conquer the universe. But this time, it's personal. ""Boris The Animal"" wants revenge. ""K"" shot off his left arm and Boris was imprisoned on the Moon for 40 years. But Boris also killed ""K"" some 40 years ago! To restore K's life, Agent ""J"" must go ""back in time"" to fix everything. So, he ""time jumps"" (literally) off a tall NYC skyscraper using a banned alien gadget and ""lands"" in 1969 before all these things ever happened. Fantastic CGI, as always. Like ""Sky Captain"", made a few years ago, almost everything is blue screen fabricated, including most of Cape Canaveral. Boris is a real motorcycle riding meanie. He kills his victims by shooting his poisonous quills into their foreheads. A hideous ""crab creature"" emerges from his sweaty palm to do his evil biding. It's very creepy and intense. It has a great retro 1969 ""atmosphere"" with all the right costumes, props,and scenery you would expect from a first-class production. In order to save the Earth, a protective radar ""Sky-Net"" has to be launched from an Apollo booster rocket and Boris must be killed this time instead of just captured. A great movie to be sure, but it doesn't seem to have enough aliens in it, for my taste. Definitely worth watching and worth owning. I hope it's a series re-launch.(Will there be a MIB 4?) A surprising and heartwarming ending that fully explains why MIB Agents ""J"" and ""K"" work so well together."
"Tss5078","9","0","1","29 July 2013"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","The formula for trilogies is simple, the first one is amazing, the second one is terrible, and the third one is pretty good. Almost all trilogies seem to follow this format, but Men In Black has always played by a different set of rules and as it turns out, the third film was far and away the best of the trilogy. In this installment of MIB, the notorious Boris The Animals escapes from his prison on the Moon. This is significant, because putting Boris away is what made Agent K's career and cost Boris an arm. Boris, determined to change things, goes back in the past to kill K. Once he does, everything descends into chaos and the Earth is at risk, so Agent J, goes back in time to stop him. Once in 1969, J enters into a strange new world where he sees that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Josh Brolin plays the younger K and is absolutely terrific, it was amazing and hysterical how he captures and mimics every single one of Tommy Lee Jones mannerisms to a tee. Will Smith is his usual self, with his quick one liners and terrific actions scenes, he hasn't missed a beat, even all these years later. For as good as the acting in this film was, the story is even better. Watching this film it's hard to believe the story is based on a comic book, because the writing really was tremendous. They took a step back and show what MIB and it's agents were like 40 years ago, at the very beginning and it was really interesting to see. Men In Black 3 is far and away the best of the trilogy and one of Will Smith's best films in years. Science Fiction is usual a narrow genre, that isn't for everyone, but this film does have something for everyone and for that it gets the label of a can't miss movie."
"shafiq-siddiqui81","7","0","1","16 July 2013"," Movie Review – Men In Black 3
","Men In Black 3 (MIB3) is definitely amongst the most awaited movies of this year. Those who enjoyed MIB 1 and 2 have their hopes high for MIB 3. Agent J and Agent K gained overnight popularity and they provided best of entertainment to their viewers. By the way can anyone recall what were both agents doing almost 10 years ago in MIB 2? Apart from maintaining harmony on planet earth between Aliens and Humans. <br/><br/>This time the movie rolls back from 1969, the time when astronauts were trying their luck to ""moon walk"". On the contrary Agent K was imprisoned by an alien called ""Boris the Animal"". After 4 decades Boris is focusing on killing agent K. On the contrary, the current chief Agent O, (played by Emma Thompson), orders agent J to visit back in to time and save agent K and return back without getting trapped in time. <br/><br/>The plot is brilliant, undoubtedly and so is the execution. Those who can remember Star Trek IV can definitely rejoice the idea of getting acquainted with unusually fancy yet weird characters. Etna Cohen's screenplay and Barry Sonnerfeld's direction provide an extraordinary and captivating experience, highlighting the evocative hopefulness of that era.<br/><br/>As far as the performances are concerned, so fasten up your belts to get amazed by Josh Brolin who performs the character of young agent K. The remarkable actor grips the character with both his hands. The funnier side of the character will definitely bring smile to audiences' lips. Will smith continues to inspire and astonish the viewers with his marvelous performance. He is charming, quick witted and perfectly lovable in this character.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely a nice one for those who will go with ""not much"" expectations. But for those who have their hopes ""high"", this fare might disappoint them. There are some great scenes and dialogues that will be loved by the viewers. Some highlights of the movie include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Josh Brolin as the young Agent K shows a brilliant stroke. Brolin captures Jones' spirit to such a towering scale that he creates the perfect old chemistry with Will Smith. It's a great change, and gladly, the old comedy team is back.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Director Barry Sonnenfeld is as tremendous as ever. His frenzied manner alters between action, comedy and pathos are speedy enough to induce whiplash.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie is high on action and it offers slick humor with rasping fun. MIB 3 is the wonder of chance that makes up the cohesive fabric of the past, present and the future</li></ul><br/><br/>It is a must watch for the fans of Will Smith, Men In Black Series, alien flicks and for those who want to discover the talent of Brolin."

"sddavis63","6","0","1","29 June 2013"," The Men In Black 10 Years Later. Or 40 Years Earlier. Or Something.
","I didn't like Men In Black II. I thought it was entirely dull and unoriginal, so I can't honestly say that I had high expectations for the third instalment of the series. But I have to give credit to director Barry Sonnenfeld, who put together a worthy sequel to the memorable original - much better than II, which I would forget, if I only had a neuralizer!<br/><br/>One thing that gave this a fresh feel was introducing time travel. Yes, time travel has been done a lot in movies - and maybe overdone. But it was nevertheless done pretty well in this. In the story, an alien criminal named Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from a prison on the moon to seek his revenge against the human who captured him - our old friend Agent K (again played by Tommy Lee Jones.) His revenge involves going back in time, killing K and setting in motion a series of events that leads to a massive alien invasion of earth. To prevent all of that from happening, Agent J (Will Smith) takes himself back in time, where he encounters a younger Boris and a younger Agent K and becomes involved with trying to plant a defence net that will prevent any future alien invasions on the Apollo spacecraft about to blast off for the moon in July of 1969.<br/><br/>The story was decent, and had its share of humorous moments, very much in the MIB tradition. I thought perhaps a little more could have been done with J trying to fit into 1969. What really made this movie work, in my opinion, was Josh Brolin's performance as the young K. He was almost a dead ringer for what you would have expected K to look like 40 years ago. He captured the role perfectly.<br/><br/>The movie goes for a little bit of a sentimental ending as J relives his very first meeting with K (a meeting which is totally unexpected) and then everyone moves back to the present.<br/><br/>This is a worthy sequel to the first Men In Black - maybe not enough to put the memory of Men In Black II out of your minds, but it does leave a better taste."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","0","1","26 June 2013"," Fun followup to a series that has a firm spot in my childhood even if Will Smith is turning into a grump.
","I was always a big fan of the Men In Black series when I was a kid, the first film was already on auto-repeat before the second film came out and then that swiftly joined the rotation. It's been a while now and revisiting them recently shows how they reach a much bigger scale than they are clearly shot on, which is impressive, but they are nostalgic. This belated sequel is definitely just as entertaining, even if it's hit and miss and sometimes on the fence. The hits are definitely Josh Brolin, who's predictably fantastic as a young Tommy Lee Jones and a surprise character of which they really should've marketed it more heavily on as it's rare on a blockbuster this scale that I care for a character based on cute reasons (and by care, I mean, don't want him to die yet). This character being an ageless alien played by Michael Stuhlberg called Griffin, who's reminiscent of Robin Williams particularly his eccentric role in The Fisher King, who sees the future in two possible timelines. It wasn't exactly original, but it was approached in exactly the right way to give the film some heart. As always, the score by Danny Elfman brings it together in a truly cinematic package and the visuals are mostly good, the makeup being better the special effects. I'm glad I saw it in 2D as the 3D trailers did not convince me at all. A definite visual improvement on the second film too, which can't patch up its cheapness.<br/><br/>The things that missed for me, although it did work eventually as a role reversal, now both Agents J and K are equally disgruntled, which reminded me of the aggression in mainstream ""R rated"" comedies since The Hangover, in which all the characters are needlessly vicious and not intended for character development. It was hard to watch their relationship until Griffin came in, filling in the role J used to fill, but in a completely different way. The villain was also incredibly unconvincing. Boris The Animal, played by Jemaine Clement, which was unnecessary casting, is a mesh of all these horrific ideas that refuse to gel together coming off awkward and excessive, with his features severely lacking purpose to bring it together. Many of the scenes themselves were hit and miss themselves, with some great sequences of very efficient jokes but also cringe-worthy misses, particularly a scene featuring Bill Hader as Andy Warhol. The time travel comes off as very contrived, and there's a ridiculous amount of plot holes here there and everywhere, but it's not worth thinking about too hard, but it's the sentimental twist ending that I'm truly on the fence about. While it did trigger something emotionally with me, it just didn't ring as true, perhaps I'll have to see if it's part of the canon or just tacked on. They really should establish that. Either way, it was an entertaining film and that's all it needed to be.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Aaron1375","7","0","1","16 June 2013"," I was not expecting much, so this MIB was a pleasant surprise
","I had heard nothing of this film except negativity, so I did not rush out to see this film in theaters like I had the previous two films. I was not really crazy about part II anyway, so I figured this one would be more of the same. So I finally got around to viewing this film, and suffice to say it was actually pretty good...better than part II. I am a bit puzzled as to why this film did create such bad buzz, I mean if people enjoyed part II, this one should have been a blast. Will Smith is back as is Tommy Lee Jones. There are a few other originals from the previous films, though absent in this one is Rip Torn, who was having a spot of legal trouble at the time this film was being made.<br/><br/>The story has J and K doing their normal routine. Only something seems to be up with K, something on his mind...especially when an alien escapes from a maximum security prison on the moon. This alien, known as Boris, has a plan to not only destroy the earth, but also get revenge on the man responsible for stopping him in the past and taking his arm, agent K. J will have to go back into the past to assist his MIB partner, as K's younger self will not only have to take on the Boris of the past, but also that of the future.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is not really in the film all that much...he kind of bookends the film. However, Josh Brolin does a very good job of imitating a younger K. Will is his usual self and puts in a pretty good performance, honestly he just has not done much in the last 5 or six years. There are a few sight gags that refer to characters who are not present and a few from the earlier installments who make brief cameos.<br/><br/>So, while not as good as the first film, it was better than the second film and seemed to carry a bit more weight than the previous film too. There was a bit more interplay between J and K and it helped this film along. It is a shame this film was so poorly received, I cannot foresee there being another film. This one had a huge budget, so while it did not do bad by 1990's standards, it did not work well for today. However, if it is the last film...it ended on a rather good note."

"mbh42498","8","0","1","24 May 2013"," Dayum...THE MIIIB...Dayum
","I did not see Men in Black 3 on the day of the premier. Actually just saw on HBO recently. The lively Will ""oooo"" Smith and the old prune K, TML, present a fine ending to the MIB story line.<br/><br/>In the beginning, I remembered why the MIB movies are amusing to watch. K, J, alien hunting! Alien hunting! However, I am not impressed with the excessive amount of swearing this time. I can understand a man like Smith saying Dayum quite often, but the S word is unnecessary. I was not impressed when I saw Little Fockers for it had ruined my point of view. The amount of inappropriate language and sexual references was a turn off. I thought this when watching MIB, but it became less apparent as the story progressed. Not very pleased with the language, but story made up for it. Something else I must point out is how friggin awesome these two are. These two killed more than multiple aliens in one scene, and are able to kill an alien similar to a mutant in X men Last Stand. The final fight scene is pretty cool.<br/><br/>I was a little confused when watching this movie because of time travel. if there is one thing I have trouble understanding, it is time travel. How one little cause changes the course of history or when you go into the past, it could be the past when you went back in time. So the past you are in predicts your arrival. Anyways, it is a little awkward that an alien agency has a time machine. Giant Proton blasters and jet cars? Maybe. Just my idea.<br/><br/>The story is what probably made us all attracted. Don't we all just love watching movies of the protagonist changing history and ending up making it the way it was originally? I love this because I just say to myself, ""Tell them the full truth you idiot! Tell him you are apart of a top secret alien agency and that you are from the future trying to prevent an alien from altering history and you are here to stop him!"" Maybe not that for every movie, but I always want them to be dead honest. J and K back together again-but younger-horay! The story is actually engaging to watch as we see what life was like decades ago.<br/><br/>What made the last third of the movie an eye-popper was that it is mentioned that someone must die. To anyone who thinks single handedly, your jaw drops to the floor. Either time can remain the same, or J must die to ensure the peace of the galaxy. When I heard this, just, wow. Very powerful thought, but the near ending was much, more sad.<br/><br/>Comedy and action are moderate this time. A fight scene in the beginning as mentioned, and the final battle are really the one action this time, plus also a vehicle chase and a few other chase scenes on foot. The humor is just at eh. The little hobbit wearing a hat can be funny in his first appearance and watching the 1-and a half duo back together brings some laughs, but not as many as the first movie.<br/><br/>The acting is great this time. There is no hot villainess to subtract from evil (sorry Mr. PP, maybe next time) which makes the few fights that much better and you really get the idea of how the past K and J's relationship is as a stranger is trying to trust another stranger. The hotshot Kyle Reese-like-hero, the older teacher, the dangerous alien, and the oracle hobbit make the movie the way it is. Not a bad thing though, for I did enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>The ending is probably the most grand of the movie though. It starts off somewhat sad, but then another twist in the story appears as a familiar face is introduced. Won't say who cuz someone probably has and the scene is on you-tube.<br/><br/>I would watch again. While there is no talking pug and the worms have little part, MIB still has the exciting agent bounty hunters as before and do not reduce the experience with the edition of a new actor. I am waiting for the next time the Men in Black will appear again on HBO."

","I will admit up front, the entire MIB series are favorites of mine, and maybe--just maybe--that is because the two leads are among my very favorite living actors. Tommy Lee Jones is so delightful in these films, and this third one takes J and K to new territory that is a most wonderful surprise at the end.<br/><br/>And Will Smith--what can I say? He's just awesome.<br/><br/>While I thoroughly enjoyed MIB 2, I was a bit let down. But I chalked that up to the typical decline of quality with any movie's sequels. However, MIB 3 is, in my opinion, on a par with the first film. Mind you, it is imperative to have seen the previous two MIBs before seeing this one, or much of what makes it so great will be lost on you.<br/><br/>What I loved: the hilarious neuralyzer memory plants, the historical personas tied to MIB, the fabulous jokes about the 60s and 70s, and, of course, the surprise emotional content.<br/><br/>What I didn't love: Hmm. I'll be...I can't think of anything. Of course I could try to come up with something, but why spoil things? I don't watch any MIB film to have a thought-provoking, intellectually stimulating evening.

","I hate science fiction and science fiction movies. But about once a decade a sci-fi film comes along that I find irresistible. This is one such film.<br/><br/>It's loony. It's retro. It's clever. It's heart warming. Boy, that really covers the bases. I went to see MIB1, and liked it. I saw MIB2 and liked it. But I loved this film.<br/><br/>It's loony because of all the alien monsters; unique and funny (although it seems to me there were fewer in this film). It's retro because it goes back to the late 1960s...great sets, neat references to the past that would only be possible via time travel, and even a little patriotism thrown in. It's clever because it's a different twist on time travel. And it's heart warming when we realize why the two agents (Smith and Jones) have that special rapport...and clever (once again) when it is discovered only through time travel, and nicely linking all 3 films.<br/><br/>I'm not a particular fan of Will Smith, partly because I'm not always into the films he sometimes chooses. But every once in a while he is in something where he impresses me...such as here. He's not necessarily the greatest actor, but he's very believable. I actually dislike Tommy Lee Jones as an actor, but every once in a while I find a performance of his that I like...this is one such role. Josh Brolin does a remarkable job here as the young Tommy Lee Jones; and it's uncanny! It's nice to see Emma Thompson in such a role. Michael Stuhlbarg is very entertaining as an alien with precognition.<br/><br/>As much as I like this film, it's not a perfect film. My one big criticism is the way it ends. Oh, it's a good ending, but considering what we learn about Tommy Lee Jones' and Emma Thompson's characters, it would have been nice to bring that to some kind of close...but Thompson has no role in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended...a once in a decade gem of a science fiction movie (with a great sense of humor without getting ridiculous)."

","It's very well made, very slick and everything we've come to expect from an MIB movie. It has been said that Tommy Lee Jones plays the part like he really didn't want to be there and I can see what they mean; he seems to be just going through the motions in many of his scenes. I thought Josh Brolin did a decent job as the young Agent K and Will Smith played Agent J with his usual panache. I did feel they went for a few too many cheap laughs, but it was good to hear 'Pictures of Matchstick Men' by Status Quo in the Andy Warhol party scene. Maybe not as good as the first one; about on a par with the second Worth a look if you're a fan of the franchise; otherwise, I'd give it a miss.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (just)<br/><br/>My score: 6.5/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"Mr_PCM","7","0","1","24 March 2013"," Better than 2, but that's enough
","After the delightful originality of the first Men in Black film, there was really only one way for the film series to go with the sequel - down. But no one expected the second instalment to be as woefully short of the first film as it was, leaving the franchise's reputation in tatters. This meant that MIB III had a major job to do to get the film series back into the black, critically speaking (pun intended). While the third instalment does repair some of the damage done by part 2, the lack of the dynamic between Smith and Jones for the majority of the film seems to leave a whole in the plot.<br/><br/>Men In Black III's latest plot line takes a new (but probably inevitable) direction by using time travel to send Will Smith's wisecracking Agent J back in time to the time of the moon landing and to work with the earlier incarnation of Agent K, played with excellent Tommy Lee Jones impersonation by Josh Brolin. The usual hijinks that we have come to expect from the Men in Black ensue, including some terrific sight gags and pop culture references to famous people revealed as aliens. Meanwhile, while the Tommy Lee Jones-shaped hole in the majority of the film is felt, the refreshing new take on the partnership dynamic added by Brolin does inject some impetus into what would have been an otherwise ailing franchise. However, the replacement of Rip Torn's Z with Emma Thompson as new chief O seems one alteration too many, lacking the spark that made Z's character such a favourite. Mercifully though, Frank the Pug is notable by his absence.<br/><br/>Generally, MIB III is much better than its predecessor, but still lacks the charm, wit, warmth and originality of the first film - although learning more about how K got to be such a crotchety old man does provide some interesting developments, and as always, the creatures are very effectively realised by excellent special effects and make up teams. However, Will Smith's Fresh Prince shtick is now starting to wear a bit thin after so many years since the TV show ended - his more grown up efforts in films such as 'I Am Legend' showed there was more to him than that, which he should pursue. He's outgrown this stuff - a fact proved by the lack of a Will Smith track on the film.<br/><br/>Overall a relatively good film to enjoy, but let the franchise rest now - enough's enough."

","After a sequel like Men In Black 2 (2002) I wasn't looking forward to watching the third film. Men In Black (1997) is one of the must-see films of the 1990s, but the third film was released 15 years later. Most people know that sequels are usually disappointing. However, Men In Black 3 is a thrilling science fiction comedy. This one runs on a full tank of gas, and in my opinion it's a little better than the original. Will Smith hasn't been in a film for four years after the poorly received Seven Pounds (2008). Here it's good to see him again as Agent J, who has to travel back in time. An additional treat is that there are two wonderful supporting characters, Josh Brolin as Agent K and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin. The humor comes often and not only because Brolin is so effective in his role. Yes, Tommy Lee Jones is still here. The setups are funny; one of the best being what happens at the factory. The imaginative action scenes are exciting too. Jemaine Clement, playing Boris the Animal, is a terrific alien villain with creepy crawly things that just have to be seen. Most of the credit should go to director Barry Sonnenfeld and screenwriter Etan Cohen. Cohen wrote the best screenplay of any of the Men In Black films while Sonnenfeld provided the film with a vision. Sure, the first twenty minutes are entertaining but they're spent mostly on finding a footing. After that though the film is a blast. It's a touching as well as action-packed experience. I definitely recommend it."

","There is a good enough story here, which is the first surprise.<br/><br/>I will just tease here the main narrative thread, never-mind for a moment that this is for a MIB movie. It is anchored in two spots, a surly old man has regrets over something that happened a long time ago and we are told, regret is the biggest 'force' in the universe, regret as memory as the ability to envision an internal space. Indeed, the switch to the alternate timeline happens in the middle of a phonecall to his partner, as he is (we presume) about to unburden himself.<br/><br/>What happens in that alternate reality? Time-travel, we literally go on to visit the old man in his youth. Inside that remembered past, there is an alien visitor who has the ability to similarly open portals of vision to alternate narrative threads. So this is pretty good, the rift between two friends as the rift in the cinematic time-space continuum.<br/><br/>So why isn't this much good in the end?<br/><br/>Sonnenfeld is simply filming without focus. The decision, e.g, to set the past story in the time of Vietnam and Barbarella is great, it could be taken in so many directions, but instead lazily milked for flat jokes.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is great though, someone give the man his Lonesome Dove."

","So the men in black are back and as vigilant as ever in their quest to maintain order among Earth's secret population of extraterrestrial beings. Only this time we're going back to 1969 to stop our villain Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement) from killing Agent K in the past and from destroying Earth in the present.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones fill their usual roles as Agent J and Agent K, respectively. However, this film sees the addition of Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men, W., Milk, etc.) as the younger Agent K in 1969. Brolin is brilliant in his role as the younger Agent K, and he picks up Tommy Lee Jones' characteristics very well, almost making it look too easy. However, for some reason I just felt like with Tommy Lee being an official senior citizen these days, his character should have looked considerably younger than what Brolin was able to portray for the 1969 scenes. Based on Tommy Lee's age, if I do my math right, that means Agent K would have been around 23 years old in 1969. Brolin at 44 years old, is much too old to play Agent K in 1969. That's a huge age difference that can't be overlooked. Otherwise, Brolin did an excellent job.<br/><br/>As usual in this franchise, the aliens are overly exaggerated and the special effects are comical, but the plot is decent enough and Smith and Brolin have great chemistry. There's also a touching plot twist near the end, if not highly unlikely.<br/><br/>I hear there is another sequel in the works. If so, I think Brolin should take over for Tommy Lee Jones... Maybe taking place sometime in the late '80s or early '90s, a time period more age-appropriate for Brolin as Agent K. He looks great in this role and maybe it's time for a fresh start. Hey, we could even get Jaden to take over for Will... Well, maybe not.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not a big fan of the franchise but I did like this installment. It's worth a look."

I didn't like how J continues to play the ""punching bag"" of sorts, even though he is now a senior agent. I think that hurts the progression of the characters some.

","Okay, it's not Shakespeare. But for its genre, it is outstanding. It delivers in terms of science fiction (the Michael Stuhlberg character's simultaneously inhabiting multiple time frames is inspired) and in terms of special effects. In addition, there is more attention to a coherent and interesting plot than in most films of its genre. On a related note, the word ""poignant,"" which I would seldom use in connection with sci fi youth-oriented special effects extravaganzas, applies here. Everyone plays his or her part to perfection - SPOILER ALERT - the sorrow born in secrecy by Agent K, and later learned of by Agent J, relating to the fate of J's father, is not the usual ""cliche."" A tragedy at Cape Canaveral that changed Agent K was hinted at darkly throughout the film. I expected the ""Hollywoodish"" approach, i.e. to learn that he'd had a wife and family who'd died there. But nooooo, it was a heart-breaking event that was not anticipated. Josh Brolin, too, deserves mention - he is so amazing as the young Agent K that I wondered if Tommy Lee Jones was dubbing his lines. If I don't give it a ""10"" it is only because it is ultimately silly and implausible. Yet it is excellent in terms of ""the usual"" (effects, humor, comic-book characters) yet strangely affecting."

Griffin, our new found hero is an amazing addition and I felt enchanted watching him.

The otherworldly characters are typical CGI creations that have gone about as far as possible, attaining that in the first film, so what is left is a retread of retro looking rubber heads that have been around since TV's Star Trek.<br/><br/>The story does have some welcome twists and there is some fleshing out of the Agents, but if this bit of fluff is to have any more life in the future it may need to get just a bit more serious in its fading flimsiness, and become a bit more of a ""Black Comedy""."
"Schnayblay","7","0","2","4 December 2012"," Decent as a Popcorn Flick, But a Poor Entry for THIS Franchise
","I was never too intrigued to see ""Men in Black 3"". After hearing about all the problems during the production of the film, I wasn't too hopeful about how the final product would come out. So I skipped watching it in the theatre, and had no real plans of seeing it in the foreseeable future. The only reason I did end up seeing it was because my mom spontaneously bought it. And should I have given this movie more credit? Yes. But maybe not as much as I've heard other people give it.<br/><br/>The whole plot of this movie is that an alien criminal named Boris escapes from prison and time travels back to 1969 to kill Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), before the Young Version of K (Josh Brolin) can shoot off 1969 Boris' arm. So J (Will Smith) travels back as well to save Young K's life and stop Old K from disappearing from the timeline. There's a whole mess of a lot more but since it's time travel, it's hard to talk about it without spoiling a lot of stuff. I know from just that it sounds very cliché and boring, but trust me it's much more interesting than just that.<br/><br/>Now as far as acting goes, it's a sci-fi action/comedy, don't expect Oscar performances. Will Smith headlines, as always, and I don't think I can say a lot about him except its Will Smith being Will Smith. Now, Will Smith can deliver amazing performances like in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"", but when he's in a mainstream comedic action blockbuster, you know what you're going to get from him.<br/><br/>Now Josh Brolin plays the young Agent K. All I can say is that Josh Brolin as young Tommy Lee Jones is the equivalent of Joseph-Gordon Levitt as young Bruce Willis in ""Looper"". If imitation is a form of flattery, then Tommy Lee Jones is the most complimented guy in the world. Brolin not only nails Jones as K, but Jones overall, throughout his entire acting career. He reflects Jones back in like the 90's where he was taking serious, but not too serious roles where he could be occasionally really funny and Brolin revisits that. It's so cool that even though Tommy Lee Jones is in this one for a total of about 8 minutes, you feel like he's still there the whole time and you're not mad he got cut.<br/><br/>The special effects are a little bit more polished than the previous movies, but they still end up looking pretty bad and cheesy. Now some of it works because of the 1969 setting and I'm willing to just fool myself into thinking they're trying to pull the whole nostalgic throwback that ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" did with its alien and the 1950's setting. I know that's not at all what 'MiB 3' was going for, but I'll convince myself that they were so that I don't just write the effects off.<br/><br/>Now while it's not as apparent as I thought it would be, you can still see the slapdash way it was reported that the script was put together. Throughout this movie you watch all the characters go to a ton of places and through so many situations, it feels like they came up with a bunch of random scenes and just said ""Ok, take these 12 and make a movie out of it"". It doesn't feel like there's any reason for some of these except to remind you it takes place in 1969 and the pace of the story once they get to 1969 feels so weird, there just doesn't feel like there's much cohesiveness. It feels so cut and paste, it honestly detracted a lot of the fun from the movie. While some of these scenes are funny, their reasons for being in this film feel non-existent.<br/><br/>Now the tone of this film is so, (forgive the pun), alien to this franchise that it feels like a brand new movie. The first two films have a steady tone, but this one feels like it's trying too hard to fit into a new generation, it's almost like the film has forgotten its fan base. I didn't feel like I was watching a new ""Men in Black"" movie, I felt like I was watching some awkward reboot with the same actors being used just to bring the fans of the original to see this new one while the filmmakers seemed to want the fans to forget the old movies. This movie's target audience is not the fans of the original movies, it's just the mass general public, and that really bugs me with franchises that have had a certain fanbase in the past.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Men in Black 3"" is very enjoyable with an imitation performance that matches Joseph-Gordon Levitt's in ""Looper"", some fun moments and classic time travel mind games, but it's definitely not the strongest in the franchise. It's sadly obvious that the script was slapped together, the tone is completely off from the old movies, and it abandons its fans and tries way too hard to appeal to the general public. I'd say it's worth a rental and if you do like it, don't buy it for more than $10 on DVD. Paying the extra few dollars for the Blu-Ray is not worth it. Trust me; you will not be missing out."

","Agents J and K return for this third outing in the Men in Black franchise. While Men in Black 3 does not feel warranted, it's a harmless enough movie that somewhat makes up for the horrendous Men in Black 2.<br/><br/>When an alien named Boris escapes from a prison on the moon, he travels back in time and erases K from modern existence, with J being the only person remembering K. Like Back to the Future, J must travel back in time to save K, and alas this is all you need to know about Men in Black 3.<br/><br/>There really isn't much more depth to this movie, and there are many plot holes to the time travel presented here. Why is J the only one that remembers K? Sure, they say that's because he was there in the past when what happened to K happened, but it still makes little logical sense. Time travel is tricky, and if you can't iron out the holes, perhaps it's best not attempted. Even still, it gives us the joy of seeing Josh Brolin play a young Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K in 1969. What's most impressive is that Brolin actually manages to make the character his own, while still honoring Tommy Lee Jones, and in many ways he's actually more charismatic and more likable as the character. As for Will Smith, his schtick is starting to get a touch old, with a few too many wisecracks that don't really hit their mark, as well, the action is fairly trite and uninspired. Even with all this said, it's still a mildly entertaining film (key word: mildly).<br/><br/>The jokes regarding Andy Warhol and Mic Jagger are spot on, the character of Griffin the alien who can see all possible futures is original and is the highlight of the film thanks to the humor he evokes, not to mention the fact that the ending is actually quite emotional and feels earned. However, none of this really answers the question as to why this movie exists in the first place. While the first Men in Black was fairly good, the second one wasn't, and it's simply because the characters of J and K were so one note to begin with, there wasn't much more room to go. While the characters don't get many new layers in Men in Black 3, they get just enough to make this movie watchable, especially if you have an affinity for the original, such as myself, and if you don't, this one's going to do nothing for you.<br/><br/>I give Men in Black 3 a 6 out of 10!"

Agent J travels back in time in this movie only to run into a young Agent K and Agent J try to erase the damage that Boris the Animal cause in 1969, only to be sabotaged in every way possible along the way. Great graphics, great plot line, great acting as usual. There are no better two actors that can play off of each other like Jones and Smith do. After the first two smash hits that were out of this world, MIB3 leaves us with what could be the most shocking ending of all the films. With all that being said I personally believe this series is beginning to lose steam with this installment and should hang it up while it's ahead."

Maybe it allows them to add those loopy bits of music in their soundtrack which otherwise might not fit in contemporary stuff.

","I am a bad person to review a Men In Black film because honestly I didn't care much for the first two. They were okay and had some fun moments and some good special effects but for whatever reason they just didn't resonate with me. I love the cast and the concept but they never impressed me much. If you loved the first two Men In Black films then you will love this one, plain and simple. They came back after a ten year hiatus and nailed it. It feels the same, looks the same and probably just as enjoyable as the first two if you liked them. I thought the comedy took a back seat in this instalment, it just didn't feel like it had the same level of comedic one liners that the other ones had. The cast is as good as they have ever been and the story is decent. For whatever reason, the x factor, still didn't resonate with me but I still enjoyed it or what it was. Men In Black 3 is and the series always was silly fun and it continues to be the same.<br/><br/>I sincerely miss seeing Will Smith on the big screen. I think both him and Tommy Lee Jones are far too good of actors to be in this sort of film but that is probably what makes them so popular. Smith is good in his role, seems to slip back into the role easily. As I mentioned the comedy is toned down which doesn't fare well for Smith's character who always delivered the one liners to Jones' straight man. Tommy Lee Jones, as I expected, isn't in this film as much as the others. The concept is that Smith teams up with a younger version of Jones' Agent K. Jones is still good as the straight laced, by the book agent. Josh Brolin steals the show with his performance playing a younger Agent K. He absolutely nails Tommy Lee Jones and this is probably the first time in a film where I believed a younger actor was the younger version. He just completely delivers and Smith and Brolin have the same chemistry as Smith and Jones. They could not have cast this part any better. Jemaine Clement is also very good as the bad guy, Boris. He really does a great job playing the main villain. Emma Thompson and Alice Eve have small roles playing the same character and they do alright as well. It never hurts seeing Alice Eve in a film as she is stunningly beautiful but a mediocre actress.<br/><br/>I don't think the film would have been nearly as successful had director Barry Sonnenfeld not returned. He knows the cast and the story well and he does sci-fi comedy flawlessly. He is excellent at creating entertaining but properly campy stories. I think fans of the series will only be mildly disappointed by two things. The lack of comedy in this one and the lack of unique critters, creatures and aliens. Yes there are some but it just didn't have the same level of unique flare that the first film had or even the second. I suppose that is to be expected though with a trilogy and one that took ten years to make. Still it was entertaining and while I didn't love it because of my own Men In Black hang ups, I think fans will really enjoy it and its worth checking out certainly. 7/10"
"jaguiar313","7","0","2","30 November 2012"," Fun second sequel to the 1997 classic
","MIB3 is a fun second sequel to Barry Sonnenfield's classic 1997 comedy about a secret government agency that handles all things extraterrestrial. In this installment one of Agent K's (Tommy Lee Jones) past enemies, Boris The Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes his lunar prison and goes back in time to eliminate K's existence and stop the deployment of an Earth defense shield. Now that K's is been wiped from the timeline and Earth open to attack, Agent J (Will Smith) has to travel back to 1969 and stop Boris and return K and the timeline back to it's order. And to do this he needs help from the 1969 version of K (Josh Brolin). While it lacks the magic of the original MIB, part 3 is a lot more entertaining then the forgettable part 2 and it's fun to see the team back in action after 10 years. The film is obviously not perfect. The villain is a bit bland, there are a few slow spots and the plot does keep Smith and Jones apart for a good portion of the film. In fact Jones' part is almost an extended cameo with Brolin, who is very good as the young K, getting most of the screen time. But, there is a lot of fun to be had and the cast, also including Emma Thompson as new boss ""O"" and Alice Eve as her younger version, all have a good time and Will Smith even gives J more of an air of now being a veteran in the organization then the rookie we last saw. The FX are top notch and Danny Elfman returns to scoring duties as Sonnenfield returns to the director's chair. Not a classic like the original but, a fun enjoyable sequel that makes one forget the misstep that was MIB2."

When an old alien criminal that K arrested escapes from prison then goes back in time and kills K Agent J must return to 1969 and save K or else face the end of the world. I will start by saying that I did like the other two movies but was never a huge fan of the series. When I first heard about this third movie my first though was...why...doesn't seem like a new one is needed. After watching this I have to say that this may be my favorite in the series. While the others were OK this one seemed to have a real plot and felt more grown up then the others. There is still quite a bit of comedy and kids will still enjoy this but the overall feel was more adult based and I think that really helped me enjoy this one more. Overall, this is still a good family comedy but will appeal to adults more then the other two did at least I did. I give it a B+."

","The first film was fantastic fun creating a star in the former Fresh Prince star, both acting and singing/rapping the number one song, the sequel however was a disappointing let down, so it was good to see the third instalment get things back on track, from director Barry Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family, Men in Black, Wild Wild West). Basically Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), the last of the predatory Boglodite race, escapes the maximum high security alien prison based on the moon, and he is seeking revenge against the agent who took off his left arm and put him in captivity, that is Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), who is still partnered with Agent J (Will Smith) at Men in Black. K knows something that he is not telling J about his past with Boris, only telling that he regrets not killing him when he had the chance in 1969, and whatever happened explains his crankiness over the years, and unknown to him the alien villain is travelling back in time to wipe his existence entirely. The next day J is having strange feelings, and going to see his friend he finds that K and his apartment have all but disappeared, and when he goes to MIB he is looking for his partner, but no-one, including the new chief Agent O (Emma Thompson), who took over after the passing of Zed, knows of the existence of Agent K. Eventually after some questions and symptoms explanations O realises that J has suffered effects of a change in the space time continuum, K has indeed been erased from existence, Boris travelled back to 1969 to kill him, and this also threatens a protective power source for the Earth, the ArcNet, not being put where is meant to go. So J time jumps to 1969, one day before K is meant to die, and despite warnings not to he runs into Young Agent K (Josh Brolin), aged twenty-nine, and it is only before a possible memory wipe in the Neuralyzer that J can convince his younger friend of who he is and what he knows about him, and they team together to save Earth from the potential future. While J and Young K follow the clues to try and find Boris, he meanwhile has found his younger self so that they can team together and kill their enemy and take over the world by changing the event that K is meant to make happen, this is revealed to be at Cape Canaveral, the place the first successful mission to the moon launched the rocket, and the protective ArcNet is to be placed on it. There is a point when Young K wants to give up after some hardships and disasters, but J reveals his true reason for being in the past, besides saving the Earth, so they do go the launch site together, along with the strange but all-knowing alien Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) who uses his power of passing future knowledge to get a Colonel (Mike Colter) to let them pass security. The two agents fight the two Boris incarnations on the scaffolding of the rocket that is to launch, future Boris is killed first after the help of another time jump and he falls under the rocket blasters to be incinerated, while past Boris has his left arm taken off by freezing it with liquid nitrogen and shattering it off. After the ArcNet is successfully put on the rocket to blast into space and to release its power over the Earth, there is a last surprise as the Colonel comes to congratulate them and young Boris appears to kill the Colonel, and that is when Young K pulls out his gun to kill him, once and for all, and J has a shock of his own when he sees his childhood self, James (Cayen Martin), with his future friend, and it explains he was neuralyzed so he would not remember the death of his father. With the time continuum back to normal J returns to the present day, and is happy to see K alive and well, and he is thankful now that he knows more about him, and the last scene sees Griffin warn of an asteroid momentarily threatening to destroy Earth because K didn't leave a tip, of course he remembers and leaves it and the asteroid hits a satellite instead. Also starring Alice Eve as Young Agent O, Bill Hader as Andy Warhol, Nicole Scherzinger as Boris's girlfriend Lilly and Michael Chernus as Jeffrey Price. Smith is still fantastic with his cool demeanour and modern wise cracks, Jones is still likable with his time on screen being moody and his small quips, and Brolin is a terrific addition as the younger version of Jones who is mildly grouchy but gets just as many funny lines. The story of time travelling and the changes in the past for the future has been done, but this is done with a good witty script, a good amount of slapstick and dialogue jokes, and as usual the great special effects on computer and in makeup to create the fascinating alien creatures, a good fun science-fiction comedy. Very good!"
"HelenMary","7","0","2","11 November 2012"," Not at all bad for the third in a series!
","When MIB first came out, the premise was brilliant, funny and really different. Usually second and third installments don't live up to the expectation of the first film and in this instance that is still the case, but only by a short way. This, as a third outing for the MIB duo, lived up to the trailers and is one of the best sequels I've seen for a long time. It's not as good as the first one, sure, but isn't at all bad. The jokes aren't so funny, or new, and Will Smith isn't as ""Will Smith"" as usual but the content of the story makes up for that.<br/><br/>This is about time travel, which I always like. The SFX were excellent - especially all the different aliens - and the homages/references to famous people always make me laugh. Did you know all models are from the planet Glamouria? Anyway, I digress. Time travel. It's about time travel and that part of the action is cleverly done. I liked how there was more heart and soul to this one, and we learn a little about Agent K. Emma Thompson was rather good, but I think my favourite character was the charming and cute Griffin, played by Michael Stuhlbarg, as an alien who sees many future permutations all at the same time. I think he brought the comedy to the film instead of Mr Smith! I don't know whether this is the last one that is being done, but if it is it ends well. There is scope for another one, of course, but I think it's a little tired now. The jokes and the patter has been done and there was little that was new, particularly. Yes I enjoyed it, and would even see it again but it's not brilliant but certainly a good evening's entertainment. Now, where is Bad Boys III?"
"JohnRayPeterson","7","0","2","7 November 2012"," Whatever expectations you had for it, you will not regret seeing it.
","Whatever expectations you had for it, you will not regret seeing it. Of course, the truly original surprise only the 1997 first MIB had, could never be replicated. Other than that, it has all the elements you came to expect from MIB. The human-like way aliens communicate with humans and the human traits given them. The despicable villain and the impending demise of the planet, as well as the race men in black are in to save it, at some cost and obviously risk to them, are all in play in this second sequel. What brought me back to see Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, besides being a big fan of Jones, is the humour the dialogue delivers at just the right times. I trust Barry Sonnenfeld will be satisfied enough with this sequel to use the opportunity to end the franchise on a high note. I liked his work with the MIB series as well as one of my favorite comedy directed by him, Big Trouble; one to which he was also faithful to the book version (not a comic book, just a really funny novel).<br/><br/>In this second sequel, a new element, time travel, adds that certain something the second lacked in order to make it interesting. Although the first sequel did not fare as well as this third MIB and of course not as well as the original, I still liked it anyway. That was another reason for me to see MIB3; I did not hate the first sequel as much as many did. However, it wouldn't have been enough for most to go see MIB3; the fair to good user reviews and word of mouth helped, I believe. Josh Brolin's depiction of a young Agent K, Tommy Lee Jones' character, was certainly a significant factor, because we saw much less of Jones, and, to put it like a certain reviewer did, Brolin did not suck. Don't get me wrong, I liked Brolin's performance; to play a younger Tommy Lee Jones character raises expectations hard to live up to. I'm simply saying Brolin was up to that challenge. For those who liked the original MIB but were disappointed with the first sequel, I say give this one a shot; as sequel goes, it's better than most are."
"fbgroup","8","0","2","30 October 2012"," Something to learn here
","I really enjoyed this movie. Many films which move between time zones can get very confusing. These time jumps were clear and well directed. I loved the character of Griffin. I study a lot about the new World Shift in Consciousness that the Mayan Calendar brought a lot of media attention to. It won't all happen on December 21, 2012 necessarily. It's a big process and has already started. We may not see the most dramatic changes until early 2013 but they are inevitable and they will be mind-blowing in a good way.<br/><br/>What I've learnt about moving from a 3D perspective to a 5D perspective is exactly what Griffin's character has correct. It's about seeing all possibilities and probabilities as well as all circumstances that brought you to where you are now on any given topic. From there you can calculate what scenario is most likely but you can also bend fate in the direction of the ending you'd prefer. Pretty cool."

Barry Sonnenfeld's Direction is grand. Cinematography & Editing are marvelous. Make-Up & Special Effects are spectacular.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Brolin as the young Agent K is gloriously heroic & scene-stealing. The Academy-Award-Nominated Actor has never been this good. A Hallmark Performance! Will Smith returns as Agent J & he gets it right, once again. Tommy Lee Jones too returns as Agent K, but here he's reduced into a cameo, as its Brolin taking away his part with glory. Jemaine Clement as Boris the Animal, the frightening villain, is excellent.

Bill Hader is noticeable.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Men in Black 3' is terrific entertainment."
"carlsalf","9","0","1","23 October 2012"," Time Travel can be Funny Too
","While watching Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprising their roles as agents J and K, respectively, one maniac and fast-talking and the other with a face of I'm-doing-this-only-for-the-paycheck, I was thinking about a family that is invited to stay in for a couple of days with some friends but after 1 month they have overstayed their welcome. But then, Agent J travels to the past and somehow everything was better in the world, much better.<br/><br/>The plot: There is a secret government organization that monitors extraterrestrial life on earth on a daily basis, protecting humans so they can go on with their normal lives. When one extraterrestrial named Boris ""the Animal"" escapes from the Lunar Prison, he uses and invention from one inmate to travel to the past, kill agent K and several years later conquer Earth. As Agent J is the only one aware of this (explained with a sweet scene that comes until the end), it's his mission to travel back in time and save agent K and the Earth.<br/><br/>The Actors: Will Smith continues using all his charisma and bravura to make this a funny character, although his incessant complaint to agent K about not being open with his feelings is too much and boarding on the stupid and needy. Tommy Lee Jones thankfully has few scenes cause is clear that he is getting tired of the role. But the real revelation is Josh Brolin, who as Agent K from 1969, makes a great Tommy Lee Jones impersonation and gives the character a much needed light heart. He carries the past part and thanks to him the movie doesn't feel like a rehash of the previous two movies.<br/><br/>The Good: As I wrote before, once the movie takes the leap to the past, everything begins to fall into place and moves at a greater pace. We learn that Agent K is investigating several alien killings (done by Boris) and meets an Arcadian that gives him an Arcnet to stop Boris's race from conquering earth. Although the past could have been used more to enhance the difference in the society (you know, Agent J is black and is walking around like he owns the place) there are several jokes that have a good use, like meeting agent W as Andy Warhol and he begging to be ""killed"" because he can't stand the frivolous life: ""filming this man eating a hamburger. It's transcendent"". The Arcadian is also an interesting character, he can see all the possible futures of a situation and shows his powers in some key moments. The special effects are OK, Boris is threatening and funny in occasions and the launch of the first mission that set foot on the moon is used as the climax.<br/><br/>If you like the humor in the Men in Black movies, you will like this one, there is nothing new, surprising or profound, but the movie is really entertaining once we get to 1969. At the beginning I wasn't expecting very much but by the end I was laughing and was interested on how all would take place so I think the movie did a great job of redeeming itself."

","A decade since the previous film and fifteen years since the first, was anyone really looking for this film to be made? Well – apart from the accountants I mean. Despite this, MIB3 came to be this year and I could not have cared less as it entered the cinemas as yet another blockbuster seeking to carry a franchise on for longer than it probably should (although the previous film did that already). The plot here sees Tommy Lee Jones doing as little as possible while Will Smith goes back in time to work with a younger version of him (played by Josh Brolin). The story (such as it is) allows for the usual alien special effects and reasonable set-pieces but there is a common thing that runs through every aspect of the film: it really does just dial the whole thing in.<br/><br/>It is hard to describe but it does feel like a film that has been made because somebody calculated what it would cost against what it would make due to franchise legacy, retro-bump and good old fashioned blockbuster appeal. There isn't the energy and fun there was in the first film; it has its moments and it does seem to have the best intentions at heart, but it just doesn't come off. The comedy rarely drew a smile from me – the noise distracted me from my ironing but it didn't do more than that. The action set pieces are so-so despite the effects and generally I wasn't sure what was supposed to hook me into the film because it didn't make me laugh, didn't thrill me, didn't intrigue me and really didn't entertain me. It doesn't have the decency to be bad though – it merely goes through the motions in a way that did very little.<br/><br/>The cast involved mystifies me too – so many of them have no need to be in this film unless they had contractual obligations or the pay check was huge (which, given the budget, I guess it must have been for the majority of them). Certainly Will Smith has no need to do this film and he never seems comfortable doing his late 90's routine here – he has grown beyond that and he cannot make it work. Of course he looks like he is hitting every mark when you put him next to Tommy Lee Jones, who looks like he really would sooner be anywhere else if it were for the million or so dollars he is getting for this. Brolin does a good impression of his older version, but it is never more than an impression. Clement is never given anything of note to do while Thompson is just wasted without a doubt. Other faces are in here too, but nobody does anything worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Men in Black 3 is the result of a series of business meetings from a studio looking for a profitable summer movie; there can be no other real reason for it existing. This genesis infects the whole film and from acting to writing to set-piece delivery, it all seems to feel like it was dialed in and that the creative juices never flow. Distracting but really nothing more than expensive noise designed to extend a franchise for the sake of extending it."

","Men in Black was a great movie, and the second movie was good too. However, this movie was absolutely awesome.<br/><br/>J and K return for the third part of the series. J and K have been partners for years, but J still feels uneasy about K's stoicism. However, the arrival of a old threat, Boris the Animal. Boris has a plan to take over the world, a plan that involves killing K in the past. In that way, K can no longer be a threat to Boris in the present. J must go to the past and save his partner, by joining forces with K's younger self. In this new adventure, J will discover things about K that will change the way he sees him forever.<br/><br/>Tommy and Will are still as cool as ever. The newcomers are Josh Brolin as K's younger self. He is cool as the younger K, and his performance lets you see that he and Tommy Lee Jones still play the same characters. There is also Emma Thompson as O and Alice Eve as O's younger self. They are charming and welcome additions to the series.<br/><br/>While I felt awkward with some of the surreal and crazy humor, the film is a very satisfying experience. It's definitely worth watching."

","It was worth the wait. Men In Black 3 is a worthy entry into the franchise. Too bad, that Tommy Lee Jones' screen time was so short, though.<br/><br/>Luckily, K's younger self, played with 100% conviction by the ever dependable Josh Brolin, was a magnificent casting decision. Who knew, that this guy would end up being a hell of a lot more revered than his father. As far as I can recall, James Brolin's only claim to fame is Barbra Streisand.<br/><br/>There is an abundance of good supporting parts in this one too. The guy who teaches J about time travel, and more importantly, that it's not such a great thing to be a black man in the 60s. The following scene doesn't work as well, though, where Smith is hassled by some not too enlightened cops. This is a PG-13 movie, so you can't go overboard with the racist remarks. Luckily Smith saves it by a great one-liner.<br/><br/>Speaking of Smith, the problem with the first sequel was that he basically had to carry the first part of the movie and the character got too arrogant at times. Here, he is still kind of arrogant, but he is quickly shown that he still doesn't know dick. That I like.<br/><br/>The one scene I absolutely could not stand was set in a restaurant. That fish gave me the creeps and I think that the scene borders on eastern bashing once again in an American movie. We are obviously free targets in Hollywood these days. Luckily, the scene is short.<br/><br/>All in all, there are some stunning sequences, even though you watch it in the normal format. I have always been a little wary about seeing features in 3D. There is some impressive stunt work, mostly done by the actual actors mixed in with some seamless visual effects work. So let's say that I hope that Men In Black 4 happens, but I think that I will be disappointed yet again. The premise is beginning to wear thin."

","No, Men in Black 3 won't make its way into my list of the best movies ever made, but walking into it with very low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. A decade was enough to make me miss the world and characters of MiB, and while this third installment can't quite match the feeling of freshness and originality of the first one, it's a huge improvement over the disappointing second movie, which felt like a weak attempt to milk a cash-cow while it's hot - MiB 3 doesn't have that 'sequel' feeling, feeding on nostalgia rather than tailing a fad.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did a lot of growing over this decade - Smith became one of the most sought after blockbuster stars in Hollywood, and Jones made some of the finest, most introspective films of his long careers (No Country for Old Men, In the Valley of Elah, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) and they both seem to have a lot of fun being back in their black suits, playing those beloved, silly, flat old characters. Smith in particular seems to take in his stride the fact that he has to step back into 'Fresh Prince' mode after years of playing more serious characters, he even seems to enjoy it quite a bit.<br/><br/>It's the supporting cast that makes the film, though - most notably Josh Brolin (Tommy Lee Jones' 'No Country for Old Men' co-star) who plays the younger version of Jones himself to truly terrific results. Jemaine Clement ('Flight of the Conchords') is a delicious villain (though the character is under-utilized), and smaller roles played by Michael Stuhlbarg, Emma Thompson and Bill Hader. It almost seems like memorable supporting characters is what missed most from MiB II - well, that, and a decent script. MiB 3's plot is a pretty senseless and illogical attempt at a time-travel story, with some elements of Terminator kicking in, but it doesn't matter much that it makes absolutely no sense - the script has heart and humor, and the movie is fast-paced and goes by quickly, not leaving that much of an impression but leaving a big smile."

","Men in Black burst onto the big screen in 1997, with a catchy title song by star Will Smith at the height of his fame, it was a huge hit.<br/><br/>Five years later in 2002, the magic had dissipated with a lacklustre sequel that received lukewarm critical reception but still did well at the box office.<br/><br/>Jump forward another ten years, we have a belated possible final instalment in the trilogy. After a troubled and delayed shoot, is the magic still there and using simple multiplication, will MIB 4 arrive in 2032.<br/><br/>Will Smith returns as Agent J, it has been a while since we have seen Smith on the big screen. Joining him of course, is Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), grumpy, uncommunicative and not on the screen for long. Emma Thompson takes over from the missing Rip Torn, again almost a cameo due to the way the story pans out.<br/><br/>In case popular culture is not quite popular enough, a quick recap. MIB are the secret team tasked with defending the earth from the ever present Alien presence on Earth. The general populace know nothing of this, if they witness any event their minds are wiped and implanted with new memories, using a cool neuralyzer.<br/><br/>The sharp suits are back, the RayBan's are there but Director Barry Sonnefield has decided to keep Smith and Jones apart by creating a time travel story. This introduces Josh Brolin as a young Agent K back in 1969, complete with a very passable Jones voice impression.<br/><br/>The story centres around ""Boris The Animal"" (Jermain Clement), a character so bad they built a prison on the Moon to house him. Clement (Flight of the Conchords) is almost unrecognizable in extensive make up, heavily augmented with very effective CGI. Despite the animals and creatures being first class, not that all the effects works well, several scenes appearing somewhat false.<br/><br/>Whilst enjoyable enough, the film feels like a connection of adequate scenes stitched together without combining as a seamless story. Later scenes are saved with the introduction of a great character ""Griffin"" (Stuhlbarg), able to see endless permutations of the future.<br/><br/>The film flags at times and Jones does not appear fully engaged, although he has only a limited screen-time to impress. Will Smith does his thing, again his heart does not seem to be fully in it, although he does get to play a couple of good gags against the racial stereotyping of the day. Brolin has fun playing the younger Jones, whether such a radical deviation from the partnership was really necessary to bring a fresh approach to the franchise, remains debatable.<br/><br/>The story wraps up in an unexpected and rather touching way, indicating perhaps that the franchise has no more gas in the tank. The Studio might be wise to stop at this point but with a worldwide box office take of over $600 million, there will be many reasons to continue.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A fair to middling effort, not a patch on the original which it could never hope to match. Fun in parts, weak in others but colourful and designed to offend no one.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the previous films, this will do for now as a reasonable couple of hours entertainment <br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

Though, I must admit that this movie rides on the back of Will Smith only. No one, in the whole wide Hollywood, would come close enough to Mr. Smith when it comes to smart ass dialogues and 'Hey- mister-I-can-be-sarcastic-as-well-as-humorous-at-the-same-time' attitude.<br/><br/>Be it I Robot, Independence Day or Men In Black.<br/><br/>The storyline is not quite upto the mark.

The last fight, just moments before launch of Apollo 11 with Neil Armstrong jet- setting himself for 'the giant leap', was short.<br/><br/>In short, the movie had little activity. But this is not to say that the movie wasn't gripping. Though more activity would have been a vital shot in the arm, the movie wasn't slack. It was a steady paced movie, could possibly have been tout, but it wasn't lumbering- of course mainly due to Will Smith.<br/><br/>I must say that Tommy Lee Jones as 'Agent K' had interesting past.<br/><br/>The villain 'BORIS ANIMAL' was grotesque. That spider-in-the-hands- throwing-darts was awesome. Man, this guy had huge potential to wreck havoc. But unfortunately, they didn't use him in the same manner as they utilized the 'cockroach man' in the first movie.<br/><br/>The 3-D experience was great. Overall it was a good movie.<br/><br/>But instead of being eccentrically awesome, it was quite balmy."
"Kane20","7","0","2","2 July 2012"," Review - Men in Black III
","It's been fifteen years since the entertaining first Men in Black film, and ten years since the flawed yet still slightly enjoyable sequel Men in Black II. Now comes the third installment in the series, Men in Black III. Of course, this sequel, like any sequel of this kind, especially having been made a decade after its last predecessor, gave me a few doubts before watching it. However, I finally saw it in the theater today, and I enjoyed it. Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) have returned to the screen, and they deliver some nice and witty entertainment.<br/><br/>The film starts out on a prison on the moon, called Lunarmax (which is next to the original lander and American flag from the Apollo mission), from which the antagonist, Boris the Animal, escapes. In 1969, Boris encountered Agent K, who shot his arm off and had him arrested, and also set up some sort of defense system to protect the earth from any invasions by Boris' alien race. Boris, having escaped from prison, travels back in time to this incident and kills K, altering the MIB agency and putting earth in danger (the protection system no longer exists - Boris stopped it from getting set up in the past). So now, in the present, Agent J must travel back in time to prevent Boris from causing all this and restore the real timeline. There's more to the story, but I won't spoil it.<br/><br/>Luckily, Men in Black III isn't just a typical modern generic blockbuster. I even had a feeling that the movie was going to try and skate by with great effects but a thin story, but luckily it didn't. Yes, it is a blockbuster, but it does retain the imaginatively and wit of the original Men in Black. The movie has a lot of the tone that the original MIB films had, and some things haven't changed, and a lot of things have. For example, the character Zed has recently died, and female Agent O has taken his place. Even Danny Elfman's music is a bit different, although it does retain the main themes of the series. The special effects are better than ever, and we even have a few new things of technology, such as interesting and awesome single-wheeled vehicles (as seen in the still above), and (obviously) the time travel technology. And best of all are the characters and their relationships and interaction, which is where the real magic, and humor, of the movie is. In his journey in this movie, J meets the younger K of 1969 (played by Josh Brolin). Another character that I like is Griff, an alien who is able to see 4-dimensionally, and can see the many possible timelines that the future can follow. We even have a brief scene at the end of the film that adds a new and somewhat emotional dimension to the relationship of J and K, but I won't spoil it.<br/><br/>Like I said in my review of The Avengers, I'm now going to the theater more often. I started of my summer with The Avengers, and now I've seen my second film for this summer. Men in Black III does have a few flaws, but they're not worth discussing, and they really didn't bother me. The 106 running length of the movie pretty much flew by. The film is not great or anything (it's definitely only a three-star film, in my opinion), it's only okay, but it's pretty entertaining. Performances are good, and the actors really bring out their characters. Danny Elfman's music score is good. And, like I said before, the special effects are great, and they contribute effectively to the story and the film overall. The technology in the film is nice, and the aliens and monsters, especially the villain, were well designed and excellently goofy and bizarre, like they're supposed to be. And yes the film is a comedy, and it lives up to that name - the humor is good and smart. As for the time travel, it's not completely accurate, but that's typical in this movie, and it can be forgiven because of it's wit and likable characters, among other things. This sequel is unnecessary, yes, and it could have been disappointing, but luckily it wasn't.<br/><br/>It may sound like I loved the movie, but I didn't. I just though it was okay. But still, it's funny, goofy, entertaining, witty, and, in my opinion, just as good as the first Men in Black movie. I'm glad I saw it in the theater.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** (out of ****)<br/><br/>For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com"

"Ryan_MYeah","8","0","3","22 June 2012"," Back is the fun charm of the first movie.
","Did you love the first Men in Black? Me too! With its razor sharp writing, awesome visual spectacle, brisk pacing, and the hysterical chemistry between stars Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, it was the Sci-Fi genre's ultimate answer to the buddy comedy. And even if you wanted to neuralyze the second film right out of your memory, fear not. Men in Black 3 recreates the same unabashedly campy, slightly gross charm of the first movie, adding up to one surprisingly satisfying whole.<br/><br/>In this third movie of the MIB - a top secret agency whose primary objective is to monitor extra-terrestrial activity on the planet earth - J and K are still kicking alien butt and taking names. However, due to a strange warp in time, K is killed by Boris the Animal, who travels back in time before K can shoot off his left arm and arrest him. J now has no other choice but to travel back to 1969 to work with a young K and help him stop Boris' evil plans once and for all.<br/><br/>Aside from some massive gaps and inconsistencies in continuity, this is a delightful movie, and what I think the second film should have been. By returning to the roots of the first movie, Men in Black 3 anchors itself with solid pacing, and a fun story, and even if the humor is definitely not as successful as it was in the first movie, it's still funny enough, and even the bad jokes are still tolerable to a degree. As you would also expect, it continues to play up the seamless chemistry between the two leads, giving them plenty of shining comic relief, but also adding a surprising heart to their back stories. And to back all that up, plenty of great visual eye candy to go around. Specifically, makeup design legend Rick Baker is seriously deserving of Oscar attention for his really cool alien designs.<br/><br/>Will Smith, aside from managing to make the film fun on his own, has a big task in the chemistry between two different actors. Tommy Lee Jones is absent for most of the film, leaving Josh Brolin to take his place as young K. Brolin is so uncanny in his mannerisms and deadpan delivery that one must assume that Jones gave him lessons on the role while the two were filming No Country for Old Men together. Jemaine Clement plays Boris the Animal with sinister relish. Not as humorous as Edgar, but nowhere near as flat and dull as Serleena. Michael Stuhlbarg and Emma Thompson also make the most of their small supporting roles.<br/><br/>**** / *****"

","This was a sequel that took 10 years to come about, but hey whose counting to a much anticipated Sequel that will become a Trilogy? Okay here we go Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones yet again hit the jack park to the main street with their great one long liners & their great chemistry that they have shared together ever since the first film. I really liked how they were the only remaining cast members from the first too movies, but no one really cared or even noticed that. It shows that Tommy & Will are the true mental piece icons of this Franchise. The film takes place in present day and tells us how Kay and Jay have basically being working in the MIB services for the past 10 years from Men In Black 2 like just your normal every day work. As the film goes along it gets more quirky & hilarious with new characters & the new villain involved. Boris The Animal played by Jemaine Clement was one of the top villains in this franchise,it definitely tops the Serlenna villain but just a little notch down from Edgar The Cockroach from the very first film but very close from 3 steps away! Plus Josh Brolin is in no doubt the best possible portrayal of Tommy Lee Jones to be chosen as the Younger Agent K ever! We see him in 1969 when Jay goes back in time to save Agent K from being killed from Boris The Animal! Brolin really look's and sounds like him, he really took the spotlight gracefully from Will & Tommy in this film as if he was one of their very own characters from 1 & 2 or it just seemed that way from his great portrayal! <br/><br/>I'm so ready for a Men In Black 4!

","Some people are giving this movie undeserved harsh reviews. Yes, the sequel was terrible, but I have to say this may be better than the first. MIB 3 lives up to it's predecessor's inventive alien creations, it's funny, it answers unanswered questions about J's and K's past. It has really good performances by Brolin and Schulberg (who plays th lovable and mysterious Griffin), and it does so in a very entertaining way. I was on the edge of my seat for all of the action sequences, and I was pleasantly surprised by Jermaine Clement's performance. Granted, his part was played for him mostly through CGI, make up, and voice modifications. I'll admit some of the segues to plot points are obvious and transparent, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! If you give it a chance, so will you."
"MarcusJ13","7","0","4","14 June 2012"," A worthy sequel
","The Men in Black series was surprisingly brought back with this film, it is at least a decent sequel and one that outperforms the second film in every sense. The film at least tries to change direction with Josh Brolin taking the role as Agent Jay's Partner. Tommy Lee Jones role in the Men in Black 2 seemed very tired and unnecessary for the character, in this it was worthwhile that Lee Jones took a back foot. Will Smith of course plays Jay and expect the exact same performance as before. He does at least find himself in a new environment as the film does bring at least some originality in taking it to a new time period where Jay goes back in time to save Young Agent K from murder. Josh Brolin does a brilliant job in the role of Young K as he actually delivers a fantastic Tommy Lee Jones impression. It does seem that it is about as close to what a Young K would be like and turned out to be great casting. There are not a huge amount of laughs in the film and it seems to be played more as an action with 'Boris the Animal' working as the best villain in the series since Edgar, although he is no where near as funny. The action is played out quite well and the effects never look too fake. While trying to avoid spoilers the film plays out how you would expect. I will say that Smith and Brolin made a good pairing and a good alternative the to the Lee Jones and Smith partnership. All in all a decent entry into the series and one that at least partially makes up for the mess of Men in Black 2."

","It's been so long since the last movie came out, I basically forgot all the storyline. However, this did not matter, as the story is basically a new one (of course you have to know what the neurolyzer does).<br/><br/>Josh Brolin was an excellent choice. As the young K, he owns it. He's suave and slick, and yet as charismatic as Tommy Lee Jones. I hope to see more of him as an agent in black.<br/><br/>Will Smith is as entertaining as he could be. It's good to see both him and Josh banter back and forth.<br/><br/>I saw this in 3D and although the glasses in my cinema sucked (it was the small type, with slight color run if I tilt my head), the time travel sequence was exciting! I had to hold my breath at some point before breathing again. The sequences with the unicorn guy showing probable futures were also interesting.<br/><br/>Only a small thing that I didn't like: the last plot twist. (SPOILER) Why didn't Will Smith just jump back in time to kill young Brutus like he did when killing old Brutus? Of course the filmmakers did point out ""where there is death, there will be death"". But still, he could've saved his own father.<br/><br/>And why K start singing ""Empire State of Mind"" in the end baffled me.<br/><br/>But overall this is a highly entertaining movie, recommended for a weekend fun!!"

"moviefailreviews","8","0","3","8 June 2012"," Men in Black finally gets a second sequel - but with so many possible pitfalls, MIB III is surprisingly enjoyable.
","It is not often that one has the privilege of reviewing a second sequel to an almost 15-year- old franchise and actually liking it. At this point in the film industry, it is commonplace to become jaded with the onslaught of sequels, chalking the lack of new intellectual properties to the cursed dearth of originality in Hollywood. And indeed, Men In Black III doesn't make any real effort to distinguish itself from its most successful predecessor - but in this case, with the first Men in Black having achieved such monstrous success and its sequel being such an awful follow-up, this close-hewed threequel is a much more welcome addition to the franchise. <br/><br/>When I suggest that Men in Black III calls heavily on the original film, I mean that it does so in its tone and nature, not in plot points or story beats. No, MIB III steers well-clear of the simple rehash trick that MIB II attempted, following a twisting narrative arc which echoes the charming novelty of the first film by confusing, tricking, and ultimately pleasing its audience with its central mystery. In the end, I believe the fact that Men in Black III began shooting without a script might have been its greatest asset, because while the film clearly has a beginning, middle, and end, it feels unstructured in a very positive, well-paced, organic sort of way. <br/><br/>I admit I have never actually sat down and read Lowell Cunnhingham's Men in Black comics from which the first film was adapted - I am told they are sport a much darker tone and incorporate not only extraterrestrials, but supernatural beings, as well, and killing is often the favored alternative to a simple neuralyzing. Having grown up with the more lighthearted, charming take Barry Sonnenfeld has had on the property, I have to say I really couldn't have expected MIB III to be any different than it is. It is a silly film that appropriately sports snappy dialogue, and lots of fun comedic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones/Josh Brolin. <br/><br/>If there is one thing that the critics' circle seems to agree on, it's that Josh Brolin's performance is solid gold - as a younger, warmer version of Tommy Lee Jones's Agent K, he adds significant dimensionality to the latter's characterization. In a risky move, Sonnenfeld makes a point of illustrating K's 2-dimensionality at the film's opening, leaving the audience thinking that, in fact, K is actually quite a boring protagonist. However, this initial downplaying works well as a set-up for the surprisingly deep character study filling the rest of the film's runtime. Once the mystery about K's past is revealed and Will Smith's Agent J is returned to the present, we have a restored and renewed appreciation for the deadly serious Agent K. <br/><br/>Will Smith benefits from his clear adoration for the MIB universe; he exudes happiness at returning to one of his most famous starring roles, quipping and mugging like the first Men In Black came out yesterday. As aforementioned, Tommy Lee Jones's character feels hollow until the end of the film, but this is not at all the fault of the actor - taking up minimal screen time and handing most of the character development to his younger counterpart were necessary sacrifices for the sake of the plot. A new side character named Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) is also introduced in MIB III whose role I won't spoil, but I will mention that I found Stuhlbarg's neurotic performance to be strong and interesting and his character's design to be quite fascinating. <br/><br/>The storyline of Men In Black III focuses on the mystery of K's past, using the mechanic of time travel for the first time in the franchise. I certainly felt as I watched the film that this time travel element paralleled the ""Orion's Belt"" puzzle in the first film, while K's enigmatic past seemed to mirror the novelty of our introduction to the world of the Men In Black in the opening scenes of the first film. In this way, the movie made a significant and well-conceived departure from the formulaic approach of the first sequel in favor of becoming a more spiritual successor to the tone of the original film. On that note, MIB III includes several subtle references to elements from the first movies, particularly Frank the Pug, which add to its familiar atmosphere. It is also certainly worth mentioning that seven-time Oscar-winner Rick Baker is back for a third go-round designing the aliens for the film, and every creature that is introduced feels completely germane to the MIB universe. The effects are more than sound, as well, which help establish that ever-evasive believability factor. <br/><br/>Most people did not have high hopes for this threequel. I know I didn't even include it on my list of 2012 films to see because of the horror show that was Men in Black II. Nevertheless, I found Men in Black III to be a mostly funny, light, and even heartfelt revisit with Agents J and K, who at this point feel like old friends. I didn't know how much I wanted to see a fourth entry before, but having been exposed to the deeper characterizations of both J and K in this film, I think the opportunity for more adventures with this oddball couple wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to the franchise... provided they remember what failed miserably in II, and stick to what worked in I and III. <br/><br/>Verdict: Movie Win <br/><br/>IMDb Score: 80% (86%) <br/><br/>~ Søren <br/><br/>A Note on Graffiti Aliens - I know I saw a graffiti alien in the first trailer for Men In Black III, but he seems to be absent from the film. I know the design got a lot of flack around the interwebs for being too silly, so it may have been removed."

While the familiar storyline entangles the old chestnut of time travel a la the BACK TO THE FUTURE flicks, the real proof-in-the-pudding is the ingenious casting of the dead-on accurate Brolin as the younger K with pitch-perfect mimicry (he's a hoot). The sprightly moving (and shockingly sweet-at-times) screenplay by Etan Cohen burns on its vapors by the climax but director Barry Sonnenfeld (in a blink-and-miss cameo) has returned to form with some vibrant mix of 3-D, special effects, fun camera work by Bill Pope, Danny Elfman's great score and again, Rick Baker's amazing creature special effects for a galaxy of aliens (look sharp for him in an even more fun cameo as a bulb-headed being with his trademark ponytail!)"
"jdkraus","8","0","3","8 June 2012"," Fun to watch, even if it is the third M:I:B
","The success of the first ""Men In Black"" mostly relied on the wonderful chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The second M:I:B wasn't that great, but the magic between the two actors was enough to keep the film together. A third M:I:B makes one wonder whether another collaboration between Jones and Smith could deliver another nice flick in the series. The answer is yes. The one-liner exchanges and witty humor that the two share is once again fun to watch. <br/><br/>This ""Men In Black"" does not just rely on the wit of the two stars. There is a surprisingly good story that involves time travel, the 1960s, and a Young Agent K. Josh Brolin plays Young K to the hilt; his mannerisms and blunt attitude are dead-on. Jemaine Clemente does a tour de force as the villain, Boris The Animal. He is a mean, deranged nutjob that kills without a thought and shows no compassion. Like with the Bug in the first film, the make up artists make his appearance look all the more grotesque and menacing. The master in this movie is Michael Stuhlberg as the alien Griffin. His performance reminds me of a savant that is very gifted in foreseeing things. It is hard to not like his character. He has a wit and mild sense of humor that he delivers flawlessly. <br/><br/>Like the other M:I:B films, there are good special effects, comedy in the face of destruction, and a new vast array of alien species. The only problem I had with this M:I:B is the gratuitous violence. It is nothing that surpasses the PG-13 rating, but the body count and amount of destruction is much higher than both of the other films combined. And there are some pretty unpleasant scenes involving aliens, specifically in regards to food. This is just a fair warning in case anyone brings popcorn or sodas to their viewing of this movie. You'll never think of fish and dough the same again. <br/><br/>M:I:B 3 is a treat to watch. It is better than the second, but it is sacrilegious to say that it beats the original."
"sharpcourse","Null","0","5","31 May 2012"," Fresh Blast From The Past
","Agent J travels in time to MIB's early years in the 1960s, to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history. <br/><br/>I saw the first trailer of this movie and I thought,""here we go again, another boring sequel"" and then the second trailer came out and was good so I thought it was worth a shot. I went to the Cinema with an open mind as I also really wanted to see Will Smith on the big screen after such a long absence. Also having enjoyed the first movie a great deal, I just wanted this movie to exceed the second and that was all I asked for so my expectations were relatively low.<br/><br/>My, was I surprised. It is no secret that the second movie is a disaster but MiB3, though not quite the first due to plot holes, still strongly holds its own. The Cinematography is beautiful and quite exceptional too as the depiction of the 1960s setting was breathtaking; and even the celebrity Cameos are a delight to see. I still wonder how they consented to appear in this picture (I won't spoil the fun and mention their names). The sequence of agent Jay falling through time is beautiful as well. Perhaps as any in Hollywood Cinema.<br/><br/>The movie still isn't perfect due to plot holes like some references Jay makes in the past that do not coincide with the time line. In all, what makes this movie fresh and is also its heart is its well written script and its cast. Of course Will Smith returns as Agent Jay and is allowed to just be his enthusiastic, spontaneous and charismatic self that has endeared us to him over the years delivering a lot of comic wits. Tommy Lee Jones could do no wrong also as the stern and serene Agent Kay. The Jay and Kay dynamic didn't quite work well in the first ten to fifteen minutes of the movie and it still seemed like they were first time partners even though the movie time frame in the present coincides with ours which is a decade after their first meeting. All this boredom were put to rest as soon as we jump to the past to meet with the younger Agent Kay as portrayed by Josh Brolin and he is quite easily the superstar of this show. This performance is as close to perfection as any can get with his accurate impersonation of the serene but quick wit expression of Tommy Lee Jones that we have grown accustomed to over the years. His performance was so great that it made the character of a young Emma Thompson/Agent O seem a lot out of place. He made his character work so well that you could see how this 29 year old agent Kay could well transform into the present Agent we well know. And even with this impersonation, he did well to make the character his own in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>The dynamic between Agent Jay and the younger Agent Kay really carries the movie and this could be the one out of the three with the most heart in the MiB franchise. It seemed to focus a lot on character development and this is a huge plus for the movie. Some of the humor did fall flat but a lot of it works. The supporting cast were not left out as their performances were impeccable both for drama and comedy and did I fail to mention Jermaine Clement as the Evil Boris the animal. <br/><br/>If you were a fan of the first MiB movie, you should go and see this. If you hated or weren't quite fond of the second, you should really go and see this."

","The original Men In Black was one of the few sci-fi movies I ever liked and it was because of the great chemistry and camaraderie between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Fifteen years later, they still have it! I never saw the first sequel so I cannot compare but this is a great movie. Tommy Lee Jones has been a favorite of mine ever since I saw The Fugitive. I think he could walk on the moon without a spacesuit. Some people who have co starred with him have said he is not a joy to work with but he is a joy to watch. He is hilarious as Agent K. He is so deadpan and wooden he makes Jack Webb look overemotional! It is a perfect contrast to Smith's persona. This film was a little confusing because of the great shifts in time but its a lot of fun all the way as J travels back to 1969 to prevent his friend from being killed and the earth from being destroyed. I also wanted to mention that Smith and Josh Brolin (who has the bigger part as younger K) have great chemistry as well. Brolin has the mannerisms and speech patterns down so well it is almost spooky. SPOILER ALERT in ""junk"" movies like this you don't expect a lot of emotional moments, but there is in the end where young K kills the alien but not before the alien kills the officer that let them into the launch pad. It turns out the man was J's father and young Jay is right there to be comforted by the young K who erases the horrible sight from his memory (confusing right?) It is a wonderful way to end the movie"
