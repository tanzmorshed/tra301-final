","Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ballit just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substancebut your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing."

","I just watched Dodgeball last night and I can't remember laughing so hard at a movie in years, from Vince Vaughn finally being cast as a person you can like to Rip Torn who is always at his best as the sarcastic coach who is full of colorful one-liners, and I didn't start out as a Ben Stiller Fan, but his movies have seriously picked up in quality lately<br/><br/>From the supporting cast and the cameo's everyone does a top notch job, Gary Cole is especially amusing as the sports announcer and his always missing the point sidekick, The Dim bulb Chris Klein type Dimwit on Vince Vaughns team adds to the hilarity, and Missy Pyle(What A Babe!!)<br/><br/>Forget what all the Negativity from the other reviewers state, this is a comedy, a comedy is meant to entertain, it is not Casablanca or the Producers, but it is not meant to be<br/><br/>(****) Out Of (****)"
"Chris_Docker","7","66","88","3 October 2004"," superior slapstick comedy - tightly scripted, it gets immense mileage out of the flimsiest of gags
","Go and see it. It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller has a big 'Globo' health club worth millions (it even includes cosmetic surgery facilities - they know that 'fatness is genetic, like baldness or necrophilia'). The lovely Christine Taylor is his lawyer, charged with getting rid of the 'Average Joe' gym across the road so they can build a parking lot for Globo customers. She takes a liking to the 'underdog' owner of the Average Joe gym though, and helps them in their plan to win a Dodgeball contest in order to get the money they owe. Dodgeball is an 'obscure' sport that mostly consists of throwing a ball to hit your opponent (look it up on the Net - Dodgeball fans take it quite seriously!) Even when I describe the film, I think 'it sounds awful' - I probably would have avoided it if it hadn't been recommended so highly - and I recommend you stay till the *very end* of the credits for one of the best scenes (which also takes a swipe at the US film-making industry!)"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","51","70","12 January 2005"," Like chocolate cake: you know it's bad for you, but you can't help but love it
","Silly metaphor, I know. The film ""Dodgeball: A true underdog story"" while maybe be offensive at times, the film really brings it back up to place with the humor. You really can't help but laugh at the movie a couple times. Sort of like ""Zoolander"", another great flick with Ben Stiller, it's so stupid you've gotta love it. I would recommend this film for a good laugh. As of movie of the year or comedy of the year, no, this is not the film. But it was a good one to watch. A true film for any Ben Stiller fan, that's for sure. I will warn though, if you get offended easily, this maybe not the film for you.<br/><br/>8/10"
"bob the moo","Null","64","94","23 August 2004"," Very silly but fun despite the odd patch of misses
","Peter La Fleur runs a second rate gym that is populated by non-paying members who are, shall we say, on the edge of society. Peter's relaxed existence is made difficult by the fact that a large gym across the road aims to shut him down. When the Average Joe gym receives its final warning from the bank, they face a 30-day deadline to come up with $50,000 or lose the gym to competitor White Goodman. After their initial ideas fail, they discover that the national dodgeball contest has a prize of that very amount  with a little help from an ex-champion, they set out to make it to the finals and save the day.<br/><br/>This film came to the UK on a wave of hype and praise but I was a little wary because I knew that the style of humour that it has can be very hit and miss. The film has the same plot that all these sorts of sports movies have and you pretty much know where it is going from the very start but, to be honest, how many people have come here for the engaging story? No  me neither! The humour is very silly and it will not appeal to everyone but I found it pretty funny with the out-of-the-blue stuff being the funniest; if you find it funny to hear the line 'thank you Chuck Norris' said with sincerity then this will be the film for you. It isn't as consistent as I would have liked because it does have a couple of patches where there are more misses than hits but generally I had a good hatful of laughs and, when not laughing I still had a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Of course, like I said, this isn't for everybody and I'm sure many will see it as a juvenile  and it does seem to have been aimed at the young male side of the market. The downside of this is that the majority of the laughs are pretty basic and, as we are seeing too often recently, the old audience draw of girls kissing is wheeled out yet again. The casting also helps to a certain degree and do help a bit to cover the basic humour. Vaughn is cool and relaxed and, although you wouldn't call it 'acting' he is a likable lead. Stiller has a few dry moments but generally his 70's fitness freak steals every scene he is in. Taylor is pretty but you can't help feeling that the film is only using her when, for no reason other than titillation she is revealed as bisexual (with a girlfriend). Torn is funny if basic and Azaria is also funny. The support cast is more about off the wall characters than good writing or performances, but Long, Root, Moore, Tudyk and others are all OK. Cameos from Hasselhoff, Norris, Shatner and Lance Armstrong are all briefly amusing and, just like Best in Show, commentators Gary Cole and Jason Bateman do spot on spoofs of low-grade sports commentators and have lots of great lines between them.<br/><br/>Overall this is not the funniest film EVER, as some critics have absurdly claimed  it simply isn't consistent enough for that accolade but it is still a pretty funny film if you are in the mood for silly humour and some pretty basic jokes. The use of easy draws such as female flesh, lesbianism and physical jokes is a bit of a downer when you think about it but I doubt many will complain when it is on. The cast generally do well and the material is funny and energetic enough to do the job, producing a silly film that is hardly memorable but will be fun while you're watching it."
"mjw2305","7","36","51","8 February 2005"," Pretty much as funny as they say it is
","When average Joe's gym, run by Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is under threat of take over by White Goodman (Ben Stiller), La Fleur and his gym members must raise $50,000 to save it. The only way to do it is Dodge Ball, and with the help of a seasoned professional, maybe they have a chance.<br/><br/>Great characters, and a hilarious script make dodge ball a Hit, Ben Stiller's and Rip Torn's characters are particularly well written, but none of the characters fail to get a laugh, and there is a good blend of them on show.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look for anyone who fancies a laugh.

"g-bodyl","10","27","38","28 February 2008"," If you can dodge a wrench.....
","This film is one of the funniest slapstick comedy ever. Ben Stiller was funny as always and Vince Vaughn was surprisingly funny. Stiller plays White Goodman and he is the snobbish owner of his up-to-the-style Globo Gym whereas Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur and he is the owner of Average Joe's. The gyms find out that there would be a dodgeball tournament held in a few weeks with a grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Average Joe's need that money or else the gym goes to Globo Gym. The gyms ended up going and making it to the finals. But who wins? The movie will tell you that. All of the supporting actors were funny especially Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. If you like Ben Stiller, you will like this movie. I rate this film a 10/10."

There are so many jokes in this movie, you don't even have a chance to rest before the next one comes along.<br/><br/>
Ben Stiller as the ""evil"" White Goodman -- it's a classic character that should go down in the annals of comedy greatness. The announcers for ESPN 8 ""The Ocho"" (Gary Cole and Jason Bateman) had me rolling in the aisles. Stephen Root is a comic genius as well, and Alan Tudyk as the random pirate (why? who cares!) was pure gold.<br/><br/>Oh, and make sure you stay till the end of the credits... Ben Stiller does a routine that's absolutely hysterical."

","This film is not intended to be a great work of art and no one will win an Oscar for it because it is just a film packed full of laughs that leaves you smiling afterwards - that is, with the exception of the few posters here bereft of any sense of humour.<br/><br/>I am not a great Ben Stiller fan - generally, I find him rather unfunny but he scores highly in this film and Vince Vaughn also deserves recognition among others for fine comedic timing.<br/><br/>The guest appearances also add to the general fun and the wheelchair-bound coach, played by Rip Torn is just a hoot.<br/><br/>This is definitely one to hire from your local rental shop - me, I'm going to buy the DVD!"
"mstomaso","6","32","55","19 December 2005"," Fun piece of camp comedy
","What's funny about dodgeball? First, it's a movie about a group of non-competitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a not-very-impressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second - Ben Stiller. Stiller is over-the-top and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn. Vaughn - playing the slightly less than average Joe owner of Average Joe's gym, plays the perennial hard luck loser to the hilt. The supporting cast is terrific. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble.<br/><br/>This is a rather extreme and rather Hollywood camp comedy. Although a lot of the humor is adult, the film is also refreshingly clean compared with the averaged 21st century comedy. Dodgeball also doubles as a spot-the-cameo film, since a whole host of odd celebrities pop up here and there throughout.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this film, I was charmed and I laughed a lot. Although the film remained entertaining, like most comedies it lost a bit of its luster in its second viewing.<br/><br/>Why only a 6 rating? Despite the campiness and good solid humor, this is still a very formulaic film and it does tend to vaporize after a viewing or two.<br/><br/>Strongly recommended - for one viewing!"

","Picked this up on DVD for £3 ($6) - didn't know anything about it We thought it one of the funniest films we've seen for some time. Thought I'd check out the rating and was surprised how low (6.6) it was. Then checked out some of the ""Hated It"" comments to see why this could be I guess that a lot of people find this film offensive, with stereotypical attitudes - like how a bisexual woman could kiss both a man and a woman (an extraordinary observation). Or that it was unfair to poke fun at someone who spent all his waking hours dressed up as pirate. I think that comment came from a member of the Long John Silver Alliance.<br/><br/>Lighten up! Comedy - like any other artistic endeavour is subjective - all I can say is that I laughed and found that at many points the jokes were coming faster than I could process them - always a good sign.<br/><br/>A good combination of slapstick humour and smart-ass comments delivered at a rapid pace And an ever-popular theme: will the underdogs triumph?

"alindsay-al","9","5","7","8 June 2017"," A fantastic comedy that is one of my favourites
","For a while now I have truly loved this film but I haven't watched it in a while so last night I decided to and in my opinion this is one of the best comedies I have seen and one of my personally favourites. The premise of the film sees a down on its luck gym in danger of being destroyed by its richer competition. So in order to save there gym they enter a dodgeball tournament to raise the money. I have been critical of Vince Vaughan before for being the same character in pretty much all of his comedies but this is the one where it really works. He totally encapsulates his charismatic but underachieving character really well and you do truly root for his character and the situation that he is put in. The supporting cast is also really good, starting with the obvious, Ben stiller absolutely kills it as white Goodman probably giving my favourite performance of his. He is so obnoxious but totally owns it in a way that it really does make it fun to watch his character and truly makes it a memorable performance. Christine Taylor plays Vaughan's love interest in this film but she is a great character in her own right and I thought she gave a fun performance. Rip torn plays patches o hoolihan there coach and he gives such an over the top performance but it works as you watch this crazy old guy drilling these grown men. Justin long and Alan tudyk also give really funny performances in this film, also this film contains one of my favourite Jason Bateman performances. The story is as described in the title an underdog story and I always remain heavily invested in the story of this film as these highly likable people fight against the evil corporation it is good stuff. However, my one issue with this film is its first act isn't that funny and it feels a bit sluggish as they introduce all of these characters one at a time, also yes the story is pretty cliché as well. The script has some gutbusting dialogue in it that always makes me laugh out loud, but it also does a really good job with its more dramatic scenes that as mentioned before makes you care about the characters. The style of the film is pretty raunchy and that could put some people off but I really enjoy it about this film and think it adds top the film. All the dodgeball matches are really well planned and all feel different and unique which is credit to the filmmakers to make that possible. Overall I really do love this film and think if you are a fan of comedies like this then it is a must watch."

","This film will not be the cause of World peace.....neither will it stimulate your emotions and lead you to donate to worthwhile causes.<br/><br/>However.....if you want to spend 90 minutes laughing your head off to constant one-liners and clever word-play from the main characters.....mixed with slap-stick and occasional goofy and cringe-worthy scenarios.......then sit back and enjoy the ride!!!! Within its genre this is definitely 10/10.......against Schindler's List or other such films, then it's struggling.....but then that isn't what it is meant or wants to be.<br/><br/>Just sit back....strap yourself in and laugh out loud....then replay the ridiculous White Goodman monologues with your friends time and again!!!!"

","Well, here is yet another sleazy PG-13 modern-day comedy that also has genuinely funny characters and scenes. For those of us who care it's a shame we have have to put up with the bad stuff if you want laughs out of about any comedy made in the last 30 years....and this is a prime example. By the way, this is an ""R"" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid. Both of those are typical, too. Yet, most of my friends said this was hilarious and to check the film out. <br/><br/>Prior to the typically-dumb ending are some very funny moments, mostly provided by Ben Stiller's over-the-top fitness guru, ""White Goodman,"" a man who runs an ultra high-tech fitness center. Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy small-gym owner who is in competition with Stiller, sort of like David against Goliath, the nerds against the jocks.....another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk. Christine Taylor is the token young ""hottie"" that you also see in these kind of pictures: skinny, pretty, but not exactly the wholesome type.<br/><br/>Rip Torn almost steals the show as ""Patches O'Houlihan,"" the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods. I laugh every time I think of him. In fact, ""Patches"" puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a ""fair"" rating.<br/><br/>A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story. Of course, it's an insult to anyone's intelligence but that's part of the charm and one does get a decent amount of laughs for an hour-and-half, so it's not all bad."
"Flower_of_the_Lily","7","7","12","29 July 2008"," Surprisingly good comedy
","The supreme pinnacle of the fitness industry is GloboGym, owned and operated by large-haired, small-brained fitness fascist White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Next door is the pitiful competition: Average Joe's, a run-down, homely gym run by amiable slacker Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who is always ready with a little advice and encouragement for his misfit gym members and who is quite prepared to let people pay their fees a little late.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Peter's lack of business acumen means that his gym is in foreclosure, and unless he comes up with £50,000 dollars in one month his gym will be bought by White Goodman and bulldozed to make way for a new car park. Determined to save Joe's, Peter and his friends enter a dodgeball tournament where first prize just so happens to be £50,000 dollars, and find themselves an efficient (but completely nutty) coach in the shape of former dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). But White discovers their intentions and the fun really starts when he puts together his own team of champion dodge-ballers to thwart Joe's ...<br/><br/>I remember this movie being something of a sleeper hit, and can see why: there's something for everyone in terms of humour, from straightforward slapstick (usually with a wrench) to classic verbal sparring. Vaughn is the calm centre to the film, wisely playing it straight amongst his oddball team (Steve the Pirate is my particular favourite) Rip Torn is suitably OTT, but scenery-mastication honours must go to Stiller, easily delivering his funniest performance since Mystery Men. The plot is straightforward and you can see the end a mile off, but a number of fun cameos and a continual stream of jokes keep the laughs coming. Just plain fun."

","""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" provides just enough good-natured low brow humor to make up for the fact that the film is not always as funny as it intends to be.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn takes on the role of straight man as Peter La Fleur, the owner of a third rate gym called ""Average Joe's"" that caters to the.umhow shall we say it? less athletically inclined, less single-mindedly health-conscious consumer. Pete's patrons are all ""losers"" and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are. The problem is that, through poor business management, Peter has virtually bankrupted the establishment to the tune of $50,000 that needs to be paid off pronto if he is to maintain ownership of the place. Enter White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the self-made, egomaniacal owner of a top-of-the-line gym across the street who is determined to force Peter out of business and make it part of his own franchise. To raise the money, Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships. When Goodman gets wind of the plan, he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's less-than-average players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.<br/><br/>Most of the humor in ""Dodgeball"" is of the Three Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin variety that works pretty well for the most part, even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile. Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another, with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a no-holds-barred display of manic energy. Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team. The other cast members are all entertaining as well, and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Jason Bateman, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short, but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film. But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy, wheelchair-bound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape. Torn is the undisputed comic force at the center of the film."

Rip Torn plays the part of a former Dodgeball champion and, for those of you who like physical humour, had me in pain from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>The story has been well thought out and put across to the audience in a way that everyone will relate to at least one of the characters. <br/><br/>It is the type of movie that you can watch without really thinking about it.

","""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is just plain old goof-ball-ism, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It has the Average Joes gym going up against Globo Gym in a tournament. The Average Joes gym is clearly a working class gym, while Globo Gym's slogan is ""We're better than you, and we know it!"" Maybe for the most part, this is a recycled triumph of the underdog story - where against all odds the ragtag team defeats the big guys with all the money - but the performances carry it to excellence. Ben Stiller, as Globo Gym owner White Goodman, makes a really funny slime-ball. Vince Vaughn, as Average Joes gym owner Peter La Fleur, creates a very commendable character. Christine Taylor, as reporter Kate Veatch, is what a reporter should be. Rip Torn, as trainer Patches O'Houlihan, is one acerbic SOB (Hank Azaria plays his younger self).

","I rented this film because the trailer looked very funny. The producers must have taken all the funny bits and put them into 60 seconds. After that, there was no fun to be had.<br/><br/>The funniest parts of this film were the ESPN graphics and jokes and Obscure Sports Quarterly, also a visual gag. The rest of the funny parts were stolen right from BASEbasketball-- the team names, the girls dancing in extreme costumes, the obscure sports idea-- but BASEbasket did it more original and more funny to watch. I highly recommend that over Dodgeball.<br/><br/>The movie feels like it was a SNL sketch that should have lasted 10 minutes yet was stretched to fit an hour and a half. The actors look like they were given a couple lines and then told to go for it. They look blank at times like they don't have anything funny to say. Basically if you like comedies where the characters and situations are just supposed to be hilarious and they are, like The Royal Tenenbaums, devoid of any jokes or humor beyond that. Maybe this has something to do with Ben Stiller, since he was in both films. That might be the case, since I did like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. <br/><br/>I was brought up with the idea of comedies to either be satires or had a joke a minute thrown at you, like Airplane, the Naked Gun and South Park. A movie like Dodgeball moves slow because the characters, after they come into the scene and give you that one laugh, like the gym owner or the pirate guy, don't seem to have any more steam and the viewer is suppose to enjoy it for what it is. It seems to be the new wave of comedy film making and it isn't funny nor makes any sense. The jokes fall flat, like everything was improved and nothing was written down. Movies cannot live by improv alone. Take Timecode and movies like that....please. <br/><br/>Then, if you get the DVD, there is an alternate ending that made me laugh, not because it was funny, because it was so bad. I don't think the director knows how to make a movie. Rawson Marshall Thurber should go back to his day job!<br/><br/>I give this a 1, which is the lowest rating I have given any movie.

So when the few hardy members of Joe's decide to enter the Vegas Dodgeball Tournament, in the vain hope of winning the cash prize to save the gym, it's no surprise that Goodman enters his own team to hopefully thwart their plan.<br/><br/>A joyous, crude and eminently quotable underdog story that demands repeat viewings to fully catch all that is going on. Dismissd on release as being a throw away comedy from the Stiller/Vaughn frat pack brigade, Dodgeball has since gone on to surpass expectations and rise towards the top of the sports comedy table. A true ensemble piece {tho Stiller's preening Goodman takes the honours}, few films of its type have fused a character based heart with such dumb shenanigans and gotten away with it. These are odd and even sad people, but unity is a fine thing, even when wrenches are bouncing off their heads and balls are thudding into the groin! Yes it's that type of film, and we are all the better for the experience. Boasting smart use of cameos from such luminaries like William Shatner and Chuck Norris, Dodgeball is a testament to how good physical comedy can be, and of course it's always great to shout for the underdog.

","** HERE BE SPOILERS **<br/><br/>White Goodman (Stiller) is running an aggressive, elitist gym. The gym is economically successful and Goodman is looking to take over Peter LaFleur's (Vaughn) Average Joe gym across the street. Only very few odd customers visit Average Joe gym and business is extremely bad. In fact, LaFleur is short $50000 and Goodman is about to finally take over the business. The Average Joe crew has only one chance to save their gym, to enter a Dodgeball tournament with $50000 in prize money.<br/><br/>The story is not great, but the little mishaps and adventures the crew experiences, along with odd characters and great cameos, make this a hilarious movie. Ben Stiller is great as Goodman (I have a hard time imaging anyone else that could make that role better). Vaughn and the other are also good, and especially Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate is really good. Otherwise, it is the little things that make this a good movie, as mentioned the story is not great, and unfortunately it is a little too predictable to merit a higher grade. But a must see nonetheless.<br/><br/>8/10"
"daria84","9","5","10","15 November 2004"," Hilarious!
","Wow it's been a while since the last time I laughed this hard at the movies. I loved it!<br/><br/>This movie is about a group of ""weird"" (I hate to see that word in a sentence next to the word ""people"") guys who work out at a small gym owned by Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), which isn't getting any income b/c it's going to be taken by the bank, task handed to Kate Votch(Christine Taylor). But that isn't all, the gym wants to be owned by the annoying/gross and long time rival of Peter, owner of Globo gym, White Goodman (Ben Stiller in I think one of his best roles ever). The thing is this guys are willing to do anything to keep the gym, they learned to love that place and they made a bunch of great friends. Anyhow, the only way to keep the gym is to get $50.000 in 1 month, and that's how they get into ""dodgeball.."" The rest, you have to see it.<br/><br/>A really fun movie, wonderful performances by everybody in the cast, I can't complain of anyone, they were all awesome! Especially Ben Stiller, we're used to see him in roles like ""There's something about Mary"" as a sweet good guy, but in this one, forget about it! He's nasty, dumb (not the Zoolander kind of dumb, this one is actually funny) and annoying! But that was the character, so I'd say Ben Stiller was perfect. Vince Vaughn was great too, funny and the classic good guy/hero of the movie, I liked him. Christine Taylor was good too :)<br/><br/>I'd watch this movie again anytime, one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a long time :) ****1/2 out of ***** (the half point taken away by David Hasselhoof's came, I have no idea what he was doing or why he was there, but it was stupid and not fun)."
"jediduck95","1","14","39","10 July 2005"," Another Frat Pack movie
","There was the 'Rat Pack', the 'brat pack'. Now there is the 'Frat pack'(made it up on the spot). The 'Frat Pack' consist of Ben Stiller, Will Farrell, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaugn, and some of their friends. These actors have their hold on Hollywood and they basically can do most comedy movies they want because they have can make a good amount of money doing these movies. Other Frat Pack movies include 'Anchor Man', 'Starsky and Hutch', and Old School'. I'm not saying these movies are terrible or i don't like the actors. It annoys me seeing the same actors playing the same comedic parts and the studio expects that just their presence should make us laugh.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to insult fraternities. I call them the frat pack because they appeal more to those guys.<br/><br/>I always enjoy a good comedy, but if the next 10 years is going to be comedy movies like this then i might just watch reruns of 'The Simpsons' or 'Family Guy' for comedy.<br/><br/>The game of dodgeball is humorous but it doesn't mean you should make a movie out of it. If anything, you should only use this story within an episode of a t.v. show (ex: South Park) instead of dragging two hours of this nonsense.<br/><br/>We are supposed to laugh whenever we see Ben Stiller while he plays one of his 'crazy' characters. He looks funny but his character gets real annoying real fast. I liked Stiller at one point but after 'Zoolander' and this movie, I'm starting to worry about his future (granted he's making more money now compared to when he was funny). We're also supposed to like Vince Vaugn but he plays the same 'takes no gruff' character. The pirate character was the most annoying of the cast. 'HA, HA, a man dressed up as a pirate in a gym. Excuse me while I change my pants'.<br/><br/>This story plays out the same comedic formula as most mindless comedies. I guess when you do a movie about dodgeball then you can't really do too much with it. <br/><br/>A lot of people apparently have seen this movie and liked it. So if you like pointless comedy that has no intelligence behind it then you will enjoy this movie. If you like a plot and some intelligence in a comedy movie then stay away from this one.<br/><br/>I'll probably skip the possible sequel 'Kickball', but from how much money they made from this one, I'm sure they're planning the sequel right now."

","Worst film I've ever seen! It's not that I don't like slapstick humor, but it should at least make an attempt to be clever. Unless you're thirteen, this movie has absolutely nothing to offer. Within three minutes you know what is going to happen - losers get taunted by the bad guys, the dorks get the girl, and the losers beat the bad guys. Geez, what an original screen play.<br/><br/>Not one funny line (unless you possess a single digit IQ), no funny visual humor (unless groin shots some how still strike you as humorous).<br/><br/>Save yourself some time and give the clerk at Blockbuster four bucks and just leave without this piece of garbage.

","I remember laughing good and hard at the previews for Dodgeball but was still skeptical about seeing it. I mean how many times have the studios shown all the funny parts but only for one to discover after watching the movie those were the parts that were only funny. Ok, you can all put your hands down now.<br/><br/>Happily, there is a lot of funny stuff in Dodgeball to make you want to see it a second time. Nice guy Peter La Fleur (played by Vince Vaughn who has been on a roll the last 1 1/2)is the owner of a small gym that is on the verge of foreclosure unless he can come up with $50,000. Even if the mortgage payments were current, the club is so outdated that it looks more like a place where homeless people crash for the evening.<br/><br/>
In a desperate attempt to save the gym Peter hires an accountant Kate Veatch (played by pretty lady Christine Taylor) to go over the books. The problem is that Peter hasn't looked at the books since Clinton was President so her help is to of no avail.<br/><br/>Things have gotten even worse because a rich spoiled brat has built a beautiful gym right next door. The brat is played to absolute hilarity by Ben Stiller who has his own unique way of impressing the ladies.(Hint: puff puff the magic dragon).<br/><br/>By sheer coincidence there is dodgeball tournament at Las Vegas that will pay-yep you got it, $50,000 to the 1st place team. Since Peter and his friends have virtually no talent, they bring in coach Patches O'Houlihan for training. His training includes tools of steel(literally)to ones face that will adjust them to the agony of being hit by a ball. (That part was included during the sneak preview but I laughed even harder the second time around).<br/><br/>Two other characters also add to the fun. Gary Cole (Office Space) and Justin Bateman from Starsky And Hutch play the sport announcers and Bateman isn't exactly rowing the boat with both oars especially after he hopes that the outcome of the game won't be affected when Vaughn's team has to forfeit.<br/><br/>
For the directing and writing of Dodgeball I was expecting to see the name Zucker or Wayan. Instead the credit was given to some guy by the name of Rawson Marshall Thurber. If I see that name for the upcoming Scary Movie 4, I'll take a chance and see that one too.<br/><br/>P.S.

Maybe the producers thought, dodgeball: now that's funny and entertaining, but they sure missed the boat.

It's dumb like that guy in your office who thinks he's really funny and always does that same little joke, accent, or quip that wasn't really funny to anybody but him the first time but he keeps doing it anyway dumb.

","I am 27 years of age and this is my first ""walk out."" This was, if not the worst, certainly one of the worst movies I have ever wasted money on (actually the theater reimbursed me). Let me begin by saying that Vince Vaughn is one of the more entertaining actors out there. While ""Made"" was pretty annoying, Swingers and Old School provided funny roles for him. This movie just didn't fit him for some reason. It appeared that his heart just wasn't in it. Maybe he was just there to pick up a check before he next decent role came along, I don't know. His character tried SO HARD to be a likable ""Joe-everybody,"" he was impossible to relate to. That being said, he was the best part of this piece of trash.<br/><br/>I admit that Ben Stiller has talent. He draws audiences and has become quite popular. However, with the exception of ""Meet the Parents,"" he has never made me laugh. Owen Wilson had me rolling on the floor during Zoolander but Stiller just left me stone faced. So I have to admit that I had some Stiller-prejudice going in. He reached a new low. I have to apportion some blame to the writers, but I can't figure out how anyone could have found his character enjoyable. Perhaps this film was meant for children who aren't interested in pesky things like plot, character development, clever writing, etc..., but I don't think so. No, I believe that this movie was meant for 20-somethings who laughed as Old School, Zoolander and Office Space. Which brings me to the writers. I admit, I'm no Bill Shakespeare, but I'm not getting paid millions to write. This story just made no sense. <br/><br/>BARELY SPOILERS HEREIN<br/><br/>Why did these guys hang out at the gym all day? Why did they care about their gym so much? Why should we care whether the gym next door takes over Vince Vaughn's gym? None of this was explained. I found myself not caring about any of the characters. <br/><br/>END OF SPOILERS (if those were really spoilers)<br/><br/>I can get my money back, but no one can give me my time back. What a waste.<br/><br/>AVOID THIS MOVIE. I'm rambling here but I really need to get the point across that you should spend your time, oh I don't know...counting ceiling tiles, clipping your finger nails or flicking bottle caps across the room at your cat.

A combination of the homophobia and anti-male attitude can be found in one scene where first we get to see girls in bikinis washing cars - obviously so the audience can drool over their bodies - and then we see a male redneck drooling over the body of a man who's washing his car in bathing gear - and it's supposed to be ""gross"" and ""wrong"" and ""funny"". <br/><br/>The same double standard is used once more when first we get to see semi nude female cheerleaders - so very ""droolworthy"" - and then we get to see Vaughn's team having to play in rubber fetish gear - so very ""gross"" and ""funny"".

","Most films, even the most worthless ones, have something about them which is meritorious. O Brother, Where Art Thou? had a decent soundtrack. Walking Tall had a good moral. Elf had some cute moments. No viewer should see any of these movies immediately before or after eating. Dodgeball, however, is one of those thankful rarities which should not be seen if the viewer is ever planning to eat again.<br/><br/>The plot deals with an apathetic local fitness center owner (Vince Vaughn) who is trying to save his cute little neighborhood gym from a major corporate takeover masterminded by an evil fitness guru (Ben Stiller) with an inflated ego and some other inflated things as well, if you get my drift. In order to raise the money he needs to pay off his debts and save his gym, Vaughn's character Peter LaFleur puts together a ragtag dodgeball team and enters it in a Las Vegas competition. Only problem is, Stiller & Co. have also entered a team. The Average Joe team includes a group of characters that I believe I was supposed to like: a sweet-faced lawyer who turns out to be an Amazon (Christine Taylor), a disillusioned male cheerleader (Justin Long), a man who thinks he is a pirate (Alan Tudyk), a pansy with bottled-up anger (Stephen Root), the Napoleon Dynamite style team manager (Joel David Moore), and another guy (Chris Williams) whom I don't remember anything about, even though I just saw the movie.<br/><br/>Of course, no movie is devoid of the occasional shining moment. Rip Torn's former-dodgeball-champion-turned-coach was a likable fellow. I smiled a few times, and even had one or two weak chuckles. The presence of Lance Armstrong and Chuck Norris made me raise my eyebrows, but I had no issue with it. Any of this, however, was canceled out by the horror that was in store in the last ten minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>A good ending can save an otherwise mediocre movie (a la Unbreakable or Queen of the Damned). A bad ending sticks in the viewer's memory like a butcher knife. ***SPOILER ALERT*** This was a bad ending. It began when Christine Taylor's character is revealed, for no reason whatsoever, to be a bisexual. It ended with our ten-second view of Ben Stiller's now-washed-up White Goodman, who now weighs about 925 pounds and has lost everything. I nearly threw up everything I had eaten that day when this image came on the screen. It reeked of pure antihumor - it was something one has to see to believe, and I hope for your sake that you never see it.<br/><br/>In past movies I have been very impressed with performances by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughan - they are talented actors. I suppose there was only so much they could do with this miserable screenplay, and frankly I'm shocked they accepted the roles. As for Armstrong and Norris, I usually expect better from them. I can only wonder what they saw in it that possessed them to agree to appear in this disgusting excuse for entertainment. Grade: F."

There are so many potential situations that I dont knwo why it didnt score.  I even thinK i could have wrote it better.<br/><br/>Rent BASEketball instead.  Its much more bizarre, makes more jokes from its token announce team, makes something more out of everything involving sports. the locker rooms, the uniforms, the mascots.  In Dodgeball other than a cheap S&M joke and how funny Ben Stiller looks in his Cobras uniform, these sort of things arent touched upon. As well, the Dodgeball games are so short, its difficult to tell any funny stories with its characters or create any sense of drama whatsoever that might help deliver a joke or make anything out of the b-characters on opposing teams.  BASEketball does all of this, and has some side stories that work as well.<br/><br/>The only character in Dodgeball that got any laughs for me was the Pirate character, and even he was taken out to early.

Here in Portugal it is called ""Queimada"" or ""Jogo do Mata"".<br/><br/>The script is based on the boundless rivalry between Peter La Fleur, the owner of a small gym, and White Goodman, the owner of a gym corporation, who opens yet another establishment, right outside the door of La Fleur's gym. Things get worse when La Fleur is truly in danger of losing its small gym to its direct competitor. To pay what they owe, they decide to participate in the National Dodgeball Championship, where Goodman is already registered.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing new or original. The exposed plot is similar in everything to dozens of other sports-themed films, where the good ones try to beat the bad guys within four lines, while the bad guys try to use all means, including cheating, to win. It's a markedly humorous movie, with jokes all the time ... some of which are really funny while others not so much. It is a style of humor that does not appeal to everyone, but it will appeal to those who already like this genre.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is an actor with a lot of experience in this type of comedy, where he fits perfectly, and he is responsible for most of the jokes, with a strongly cartoon character and with touches of social criticism. I liked the work of the actor, he really steals attention for himself and not always (almost never) had anyone to shoulder with him. Vince Vaughn was up to the character and gave him a touch of honesty and sincerity, but is too serious to make him laugh. Christine Taylor is the girl in the movie, but it doesn't do much more than be a presumed future romantic pair of Vaughn's character. The rest of the cast gives the essential support and is funny when it has to be. In addition, we have small cameos from Lance Armstrong (it was not yet known how he truly won the Tour), Chuck Norris, David Hasselhoff and other well-known names.<br/><br/>This movie is funny ... it doesn't make us laugh until it hurts, because many of the jokes used are not particularly elegant, but entertain the weather quite well and do not disappoint us."

","This movie has so many funny parts and one of the funniest characters I've seen (white Goodman played by Ben Stiller). But it also had a lot of stupid parts and cheesy jokes, while certain actors added no comedic value to the movie whatsoever (Vince Vaughn, the black guy, the fat guy, the pirate) etc. also lots of cliche moments (4 viewings)"
"jpschapira","6","0","0","27 November 2005"," Ben Stiller movies...
","There are some things we've (I) got to admit and others I've got to accept. I've got to admit that Ben Stiller keeps reinventing himself, always succeeding; but someone needs to tell him he's still giving us the same thing. He might change the tone of voice and the hair, but he still invites Hank Azaria to do the same stupid accents (no disrespect with Azaria), if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>I've got to accept that Rawson Marshall Thurber's first full-length feature has its great moments. I've got to accept that although Christine Taylor keeps working with her husband, she is a talented and charming actress, not mentioning a strangely beautiful woman. And last I've got to accept that Ben Stiller is not the only reason to watch a Ben Stiller movie.<br/><br/>In ""Duplex"" other reason to watch his movie was one of the loves of my life, Drew Barrymore; in ""Along Came Polly"" it was the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman: in ""Dodgeball"" it's Vince Vaughn. Arguably the most natural comedic actor of his generation (and also a good dramatic performer if you want to watch), he leaves Stiller painted in the wall. And this is not a comparison; I just wanted to make clear that Vaughn never seems to be making any effort.<br/><br/>Effortless is as much as this film accomplishes too, due to the fact that it has the most predictable script I've witnessed in a long time (well ""Honey""). In addition, the writer/director relies on his cast presence to make us laugh, without realizing his lines are funny but not the way he places them in his picture. We know we could laugh, but it just doesn't come out.<br/><br/>What surely gave Thurber the confidence in his project was his main factor: the sport. Yes, ""dodgeball"" or that kind of game we were watching Rip Torn training the characters. The man knew that with this, he would keep the audience until the end, no matter what; this is something everyone was going to stay tuned for. It was widely original, and that's the reward.<br/><br/>Maybe it is just about bringing the audience in, like Robert Rodriguez did, when he gave two short appearances to a second-billed Salma Hayek. My point is that Hollywood these days is extremely dependable, and there's a scene in the credits that talks about it; stay so you can watch it.<br/><br/>So what I mean is that the stars move a lot inside a movie, and I just wanna know what Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn's projects are. The second one will make a romantic comedy with Jennifer Anniston, and the first one will do ""Madagascar 2"" or something?? Anyway, you have to choose because they're both big stars and I'm not sure they'll be pairing up for you; again. I'd go see Vaughn; I bet he'll surprise me <br/><br/>The underdog story, always seems to be true, but somehow this is ""the true"" underdog story. I'm just joking because it is the same resolution with an always interesting road. So I met the characters, the situations, the tournament transmitted by a once Brady (it's sad) and the final and most fundamental decision taken byChuck Norris (yes, Norris) leading to two different opinions: ""Thank you, Chuck Norris""<br/><br/>""F***ing Chuck Norris!"""

","Sports movies are always the same. So much so that they are basically the same movie watched over and over again. Underdog team needs to beat the big guys so they can save the bar/house/club etc. Dodgeball is referred to as A True Underdog Story. And so it is. It is a clichéd, over-the-top, exaggerated version of the same sporting movies that have been made every year for the past half-century. Peter Le Fleur (Vince Vaughn) and his regulars at his gym, Average Joe's take on the professional, elite team of rival White Goodman and his own gym in the standard sporting movie plot. However, the game they choose to play is dodgeball, perennial favourite of American PE teachers and my PE teacher in High School. The object of the game at the school level is for big, sporty kids to pelt unpopular geeks like myself with balls over and over again. The professional dodgeball circuit portrayed in the film is sleek, sophisticated and apparently quite popular. Of course, it's all a big joke. Peter's team are the usual bunch of misfits. There's the geeky former cheerleader Justin, sad, mild Gordon and The Dread Pirate Steve. He is joined by Kate Veatch, the banker hired by Goodman to acquire Peter's gym. They are all coached by former Dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan, now a wheelchair bound, sex-obsessed loony who trains them by throwing spanners at them. The movie is very silly, but it's still amusing. There are a number of good sight gags of the slapstick variety, and there are some good one-liners, particularly from Stiller and Vaughn. Stiller plays the bad guy in this film, but it's a similar character to that from Zoolander; dumb, shallow and self-centred. Stiller plays the egomaniac so well I can't help but wonder if there's an element of reality in his portrayal. The movie is filled with odd characters who do and say odd things, which is OK because I respond well to that kind of humour. Dodgeball is not a great film. It's possibly not even a good film. But it is an amusing film. That's really all one can ask from a comedy. Anti-sport movies are becoming more common these days; the Australian film Crackerjack springs to mind, which is basically the same old story but concerning lawn bowls. Dodgeball works as a satire, or a spoof, of these movies but mostly it works as a way of raising a smile, even if the jokes are dumb and the plot non-existent. Enjoy it; genuinely funny films are rare. Good-o-meter rating: 7/10"

","There were parts of this movie where I was literally in pain laughing so hard, namely the training sequence in the middle. What spoiled this movie for me was its shameless crude humor. I've seen movies with tasteless humor before (almost every Stiller flick), but this was especially disappointing because the movie would have been so uproariously funny without it! The last scene especially turned me off, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth for the movie. If this happens to you, though, I would suggest watching the extra features which contain extra footage of the skinny kid getting pelted with dodge-balls. I was crying I laughed so hard."

","SPOILERS Every year there are specific situations in Hollywood films which smack of unoriginality. Whether the underdog coming out on top, the romantic aspect or the geek hero turning good in the end, Hollywood grabs these stories by the horns and exploits them beyond a joke. So it's no surprise that major spoofs arrive on the scene. ""Dodgeball"", like other films over the last ten years has exploited the catalogue to provide a hilarious little film.<br/><br/>Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) runs Average Joes Gym. A nice guy by all standards, La Fleur spends his time with a bunch of regular losers who work out at his gym. All things look set to change however when White Goodman (Ben Stiller), owner of a major corporate gym, threatens to buy the gym unless La Fleur can earn $50,000. Now La Fleur, his friends and lawyer Kate (Christine Taylor) will work together to try to become a successful team in one of the most dangerous sports of all. Yes, they're going to play Dodgeball.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about ""Dodgeball"" is just how daft it really can be. With some superb little jokes, it ridicules and pokes fun at every Hollywood situation in the book.<br/><br/>With brilliant performances by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, the film might never be a world best, but it remains hilarious and entertaining.<br/><br/>It's hard to know what more to say about ""Dodgeball"" really. It's a daft, funny, little film with superb casting and some magical little moments. It ridicules Hollywood and it does it with style. Well worth a watch, but it's perhaps better if you appreciate how predictable Hollywood can be."

","This is a pretty funny comedy that benefits from a great cast!. It had a lot of laughs lots of likable characters, and an amusing finale, predictable but amusing. It never takes itself seriously, and Stiller is excellent, plus the film had a lot of cool cameo's. Some of the jokes were a miss, but most of them were pretty funny, and it's good natured. It's predictable at times, but this mostly a pretty funny time that made me laugh quite a bit. The Directing is pretty good. Rawson Marshall Thurber, does a pretty good job here with keeping the film at a good pace, good lighting, great use of colors, and overall he did a solid job!. The Acting is very good!. Vince Vaughn does a great job here, he is likable, a good leader, and goo in the acting department, he is a very Versatile Actor and was perfect for this part!. Ben Stiller is HILARIOUS as always, and was great here, he could be an ass at times, but he was likable, and cracked me up. Christine Taylor is GORGEOUS!, and does very well, and had decent chemistry with Vaughn, and it's funny that her and Stiller are married in Real life!. Rip Torn does a very good job here, as the coach i liked him. Justin Long is funny, and very likable in a geeky sort of way. Stephen Root is very funny as usual and plays the usual nerd role. Joel Moore did what he had to do well. Chris Williams had a few funny lines but didn't have that much to do. Alan Tudyk is very funny here, especially in that Pirate getup!. Gary Cole is good as the Announcer, he is also an excellent character actor!. Lance Armstrong,Chuck Norris,William Shatner,David Hasselhoff do great in there cameo's. And Julie Gonzalo is very cute, and did her job well, as the cheerleader. Overall i highly recommend this one, it's good for a night of laughs! ***1/2 out of 5"

","Dodge Ball is a fairly funny movie. It certainly has it's moments, and if you like Ben Stiller then you'll probably like this film. The exchanges between Stiller and Vaughn are classic. Stiller just has to get the last word in regardless and it's hilarious! Some of the scenes with Patches O'houlihan are great too. ""If you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ball!"" Hilarious! The cast is so-so in my opinion. I do like Vince Vaughn, but some of the characters in the movie are just kinda..well... stupid. I mean, what business does Steve the Pirate have in this movie? Still have not figured that one out. I thought the chick from Romanovia was a little much as well, but that's just me.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me a lot of some of Adam Sandler's earlier movies like Billy Madison. The movie has it's moments and uses some of the same retarded humor but it's not a great movie by far. If you like Sandler then you'll watch any of his flicks. The same can be said here with Ben Stiller. If you like him, then you'll like this movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line for me when commenting on a movie is this; Did it entertain me? Yeah. It's a decent movie with hilarious spots. Not great, but a fairly entertaining film."

","Ben Stiller is without doubt one of the most popular and finest actors on the comedy side these days; together with Owen Wilson, Will Ferrel and Vince Caughn they seem to have a brought a small revolution into typical Hollywood laughs.<br/><br/>DODGEBALL features neither Ferrel or Wilson; but it's got Stiller in his ace and Vaughn with his clothes on, not revealing his body for sure. This is a comedy, it's very simple. The laughs come tight and in fine spirit they're filled with irony, childish comments and stupidity, and DODGEBALL makes it all very viewable. Stiller playing the top-trained White Goodman who's goal is to be the best, and he will do everything to bring the next-door training house Average Joe's down.<br/><br/>David Hasselhoof has a great cameo, same with Chuck Norris (although he ain't that a laugh), DODGEBALL is packed with the perfect twist between true and pure pathetic comedy and smart belly laughs, and that keeps the movie rolling although it's storyline is surely not that good of a script. Dozens of fine dialogs and entertainment. But; the movie stumbles when it gets to the part of being hilarious. It never really scores that much points on the ""laughing out loud"" part, maybe because it's a bit too busy about keeping it all so glossy stupid and ridiculous that it doesn't make time for such.<br/><br/>DODGEBALL is a very worthy Stiller movie, and does almost everything right on it's scale. Better than Zoolander it is, but not as good as Starsky & Hutch. STARS: 4/5"

The story is anything but original. It is just a retread of ""gotta raise money to save something"" plot. Ben Stiller provides most of the laughs, as to be expected, but the supporting actors get some good gags too. Vince Vaughn plays the hero as laid-back as possible. Some of the humor misses such as Patches O'Houlihan's jokes played by an almost unrecognizable Rip Torn. If you aren't too uptight to enjoy a silly slap-stick comedy, give Dodgeball a rent."

I've never seen a movie that works on so many different comedy levels as this. The main characters are pretty much ""homages"" to other films. Namely Vince Vaughn and Steven Root's characters being an homage to Peter Venknan and Louis Tully from ""GHOSTBUSTERS"", and Ben Stiller is sorta reprising this same type character he played in ""HEAVYWEIGHTS"" and ""HAPPY GILMORE"". If you love Vince Vaughn playing his typecast wise-ass roles, this movie is for you. If you loved stiller acting obscene and weird, this movie is for you. If you love straight out slapstick watching the actors obviously in real pain, this is for you. I haven't seen a comedy in a long, long time that everyone I know likes as much as this film.

Also another one of my favorite sport movies too. This movie is about a guy named Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) who is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. The facility's eclectic client of decidedly less-than-average Joes is comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, ego maniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds and save the Average Joes gym from going out of business and winning the $50 million dollars in a winner take all dodge-ball tournament in Las Vegas with the help from a senior dodge-ball player Patches O'Houlihan (older version played by Rip Torn and the younger version played by Hank Azaria). After this movie came out in theaters back in June 2004, adult dodge-ball leagues began to play all across the country and Gary Cole was even invited to a pro dodge-ball tournament in Chicago, IL. Hope they start doing a professional dodge-ball league to the point where it is being played in arenas where NBA/NHL teams play in! But who knows?

It is very much like Zoolander (comparing it to another Ben Stiller stupid comedy) with its humor, just with dodgeball and not models. For the most part, the dodge-ball plays out as believable except for *SPOILER WARNING* the final throw in the end, in which the Vince's character hits Ben's character while blindfolded after doing a matrix-esqe dodge. *END SPOILER*. The plot is likable but has places to be improved on.

"ThurstonHunger","5","0","0","31 December 2004"," Dodgeball hits target but just bounces off, leaves no sting
","Not sure where this film failed to be a gut-buster. On paper with the actors, and even some of the movies quotes listed at IMDb, it seems like it should have rated higher on the mirth meter. <br/><br/>In retrospect, I think one problem is the film hangs so much upon Stiller's inflated lampooning of the White Goodman character. It's done somewhat cleverly and no doubt aggressively enough, but you never get the sense that behind it all Stiller feels anything remotely resembling a connection to his character. It's more of a class clown tour-de- force that just wears thin over the course of a full-length film.<br/><br/>All ""those beautiful people are really ugly and vapid"" moments are kind of undercut by a culture that has already seen celebrities at their worst volumes one, two, ad nauseum.<br/><br/>In addition, Stiller's character sort of obliterates Vince Vaughan whom I was looking to seeing more from. Vaughan's humor tends to be more subtly acerbic, and typically you're not so sure who's in on the joke. He's too cool to be cool, too dorky to be dorky?<br/><br/>It's got to be so hard to write, rehearse, re-shoot and edit a comedy...and keep some sort of truly improvisational zip to it. I think that's why we hunger so much for the bloopers and outtakes. A big part of comedy is the juxtaposition of two really unexpected forces...but many of us have already seen too many ""everything-and-the- kitchen-sink"" comedies. Even the principals in the voice-over commented on this when talking about the dodge wrenches scene.<br/><br/>More interesting was the alternate ending suggested with the DVD and again discussed in the voice-over. We are to believe the studios wrenched a happy ending for these Bad News Nerd Bears.<br/><br/>That coupled with the end-of-the-credits lard of the Milkshake dance by Stiller, hint at a darker, stronger comedy. Plated with latex, Stiller taunts America with the payoff that they wanted... and says ""You happy? Fatty make a funny?""<br/><br/>The dance and play on the already too often parodied pop song are no big deal. However that one line was arrestingly funny for me.<br/><br/>That left a mark for me. The other barrage of humor is a mix of hits and misses that will probably depend more on when and who you see the film with. <br/><br/>So I guess Dodgeball hits square on the grundle, 5/10."

In order to save their favorite local gym, a slacker (Vince Vaughn) assembles a motley group of friends into a strong enough dodgeball team to enter into an intensive competition in Vegas against the superstar team assembled by the corporation taking over the gym, led by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). The story is kind of new at least the dodgeball part but the underdog part has been used a lot. The trailer was really funny but as it always happens all of the jokes are used in the trailer and that there were no new funny jokes in the movie. The movie is only 92 minutes but it feels like its two hours especially when the theme is dodgeball and all they do is throw balls at each other. After awhile, watching someone get hit in the face with a dodgeball loses it appeal. The cast doesn't really save this movie either, first there's Vince Vaughn who is mildly funny in the movie but he should have been a lot funnier. This is Christine Taylor's first role since the hilarious Zoolander and she doesn't really add anything to the film nor does she take anything away. This is Ben Stiller's fourth film in six months and is the third best out of the four. His character is really annoying and is not very but hopefully he can rebound with Meet the Fockers. What saves this movie is the supporting cast as they bring in the laughs the best being Rip Torn and Missi Pyle. Director is Rawson Marshall Thurber, this is his first mainstream movie and he did a decent job. Rating 5/10, not a very funny film even with the talent involved."

","Maybe the underquote of 'Dodgeball' shouldn't be: 'A true underdog story', but 'how a comedy about the stupidest subject became one of the best of recent years'.<br/><br/>So there's your typical group of losers, who all are connected to 'Average Joe's' gym, in desperate need of some money, or else they will be bought up by snotty Globo Gym owner White Goodman (Ben Stiller in yet another great role). They enter a dodgeball competition to get the needed 50 grand, but of course Globo Gym enter their own team. So, who's gonna make it to the final and who will ultimately become Dodgeball heroes? We all know the answers, but that's OK, 'cause Dodgeball has so many fun to offer we don't even care. As I said, Stiller's hilarious, as are Joel Moore and Stephen Root, but the true star is Rip Torn. His characterization of coach Patches O'Houlihan, once the best Dodgeball player around, should deserve him an Oscar. And I mean it.<br/><br/>One more notable appearance: Christine Taylor again is a nice surprise (as in Zoolander), I noticed she's not really doing anything now: how come?

In a battle against average Joe (Vince Vaughn) in the game of dodge-ball. however if u dot have good patience you will begin to wonder how is this story named dodge-ball, but after about 10 minutes u figure it out. Ohh and make sure you watch through the credits, i wont ruin the surprise but just don't forget the Kleenex you will laugh so hard u cry. it is hilarious and as of this moment is the best comedy of the 2004 year, until Anchorman the legend of Ron Burgundy comes out. If you are looking for a night to act like a little child again rent this movie and fall out of your with laughter."

","I delayed for a long time in watching Dodgeball because I despise Ben Stiller with an unnatural passion. While I think he's fine as a regular actor I find any and all of his attempts at comedic acting unbearable. I have to say that this was a major loss on my part because this is a funny funny movie.<br/><br/>This is the typical outcasts against bullies stories but with gyms and dodgeballs. Its great fun and the cast is mostly fine, and Rip Torn standing out as the old salt dodgeball expert.<br/><br/>What more can I say, you know the drill. rent the DVD and have a good time."

","Peter LaFleur is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. The facility's eclectic clientele of decidedly less-than-average Joes is comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman, the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds--and their own ineptitude--to try to save Average Joe's. How? A showdown dodgeball competition against Globo Gym.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the bashing this movie received(not on this site, from the critics) I thought it was amusing and, in a strange way, was very clever. Ben Stiller is funny and Vince Vaughen is good as well. Christine Taylor was the sparkle on the screen as the girl interest of Vince. So If you are looking for a good rental or w/e, this is a good choice. Just wait til your kids are out...<br/><br/>PG-13 for sexual humor, language and some comic violence."

","Terrific movie. Comedy of the year so far (if we just forget about Along Came Polly which was another Ben Stiller classic). Acting was definitely up to par for each of the actors. Christine Taylor (Ben Stiller's wife in real life) was very good and looked the same. Rip Torn was good, not great, but Hank Azaria (who is also on the Simpsons and brilliant there to) who plays Patches when he was younger gives an outstanding cameo. Vince Vaughn did every thing possible with a not exceptional role. Certainly would have really helped his comedy career though without a doubt. Alan Tudyk was alright, but of course the star as in all his movie (literally) was Ben Stiller who was just so entertaining throughout the whole film. Whenever he was on screen you were excited because you knew it wasn't going to be boring. He seems to play dumb people very well in all his roles. What amazes me is how someone who can act with that much energy and enthusiasm in his role can change himself so much that he's able to play a role like his one in Along Came Polly which is basically the exact opposite. He's definitely one of the best comedy actors of all time even up there with Jim Carrey and Mike Myers."

","Ben Stiller is very bright and very funny and he is one of those presences that is just really nice to have in a movie, and is always memorable. This character is great, with his mustache, feathered hair, over-the-top one-liners, slimy outfits, creepy smile with teeth that are ridiculously white.<br/><br/>However, I felt torn about the movie. The opening, with the infomercial for Ben's gym was a hysterical parody of those genre of infomercials. The movie itself, however, wore its plot on its sleeve and was predictable and paint-by-numbers. I suppose it was a send up of several other underdog-type sports movies ala Mighty Ducks and Bad News Bears. It worked on many levels and at points was very very funny. I guess, although it felt like an ""I've seen this before"" type flick, it still had redeeming qualities. <br/><br/>I've been watching lots of offbeat indies and European films recently, so watching a Hollywood flick that follows Syd Field's screen writing books to a tee, where the good guy wins and the bad guy loses out; where the plot follows a very very well-tread line, is difficult to watch without being uber-aware of how overdone this type of plot is.<br/><br/>That being said, the quality of the movie depends on leaving certain pre-conceptions at the door. I mean, it's kind of childish, socking-dodgeball-players-in-the-balls sort of humour. But it is funny. The painting in his office of him wrestling a bull (taking the bull by the horns), the pumping up the crotch area of his silver hip hugging pants before seeing the girl (""the"" girl)... i mean, it's about the details. Ben Stiller is a comedian, a comedic writer and a wonderful comic actor. I thought The Cable Guy was brilliant. Other movies he's been involved with have been really great and really funny. This may not go down as a classic, but it's got some really funny moments... yet on the other hand, moments that make you cringe because you know you've seen them before, or because they are there simply to progress the plot towards the next plot point, and they feel awkward and forced. <br/><br/>Overall, though, Stiller did a pretty good job lampooning workout places and that whole scene, even if it was somewhat predictable."

","Films like this come and go like J.LO's husbands but when Ben Stiller is apart of it you always know a little something extra is going to be the appetizer of the entire film which is Ben Stiller really.<br/><br/>His performance completely takes over the entire movie. When every scene with Vince Vaughn and co shows up I keep thinking to myself when are they going to bring White Goodman on for more time? I love the whole story and all the characters but I would have loved an entire film on Goodman. Overall the films a complete blast and should be merited on that but I just can't get enough of White Goodman and his phrases out of my head. If Ben Stiller carries on the way he is at the moment then he will be a legend in no time what so ever. Great to see Rip Torn back in the saddle but Freddy Got Fingered is still his NO 1 comedy but he shines in this.<br/><br/>They have to make a spin off for White Goodman and there should be a petition online as we speak to make this actually happen and of course ask Ben Stiller."

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Dodgeball"" in itself is a hilarious, amusing concept- knock the other guy out with a ball while you yourself not getting hit to survive in the game. Try incorporating this into a summer comedy, starring the ingenious comic of Ben Stiller, and the result is nonstop hilarity, entertainment, and a good time well accounted for its price. In ""Dodgeball"", you have a group of adult misfits, contending with another imperious group for control of their place of activity- the gym. This invites an amusing premise- why not challenge the ""big bad wolf"" in a dodgeball tournament, the winner gaining control of the gym and its stakes? So ensues a relentless, hilarious adventure of the underdogs going for the gold. Enter the insanely funny Rip Torn as the team's instructor, educating them in Unorthodox manners the rules of the game (""Dodge a wrench, dodge a ball""), who provides the film's greatest laughs and amuses the audience throughout the duration of his screen time. Perhaps somewhat too zany, particularly toward the end, as some of the characters overstep their roles (e.g. ""the pirate"") and the finesse being too contrived and predictable. Yet overall, the hilarious content and execution of this delicious concept made for one happy experience at the movies this summer. ***1/2 out of ****"

","I don't want to come off on the wrong foot I am the biggest fan of this new wave of comedies hitting the big screen like Old School, Starsky & Hutch, Dodgeball, and eagerly awaiting Anchorman. In short I love the actors that star in these movies; Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black (waiting for him to join the gang).<br/><br/>But I was quite annoyed with the delivery/layout of Dodgeball. Now I don't want it to look like I'm backtracking on what I said before I did love the film but I felt the way that the director basically was setting up the dialogue so that Vince Vaughn could say something humorous. It simply felt forced and unnatural. With a character saying something stupid or unwitty just so Vince could comeback with a clever quip. Ben Stiller was a laugh a minute as the egotistical White Goodman (I'm sure there's a race related joke in there somewhere; White Good Man) and I also thoroughly enjoyed Steve the pirate, who is one of the most random characters I've seen in a while with no explanation as to why he thinks he is a pirate. If that was a nail in comedy you just hit it on the head.<br/><br/>I am now in a state of limbo waiting to see Anchorman so that I can finally decide who is my favourite comedic actor Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell and unfortunately at the moment I think I'm leaning towards the Ferrell beast.<br/><br/>Overall a good laugh and worth a watch if you like this batch of comedy although I would have enjoyed seeing a few more of the Dodgeball teams.

","We all know the story from the previews already? A quick recap: Good vs. Evil, Big business Vs. Little guy and so on. It's an over-used plot line in movies and an excuse for Ben Stiller ( as the somewhat strange White Goodman, owner of the high tech Globo gym ) to make some one liners and do a bit of slapstick with on screen cohort Vince Vaughn ( as Peter La Fleur , the lax owner and friend of the locals at Average Joe's gym, conveniently located right across the street from Globo ). Vaughn's character needs $50K in 30 days to stop Goodman from acquiring his gym and they enter a dodgeball tournament.<br/><br/>With the pre-amble out of the way I honestly enjoyed this movie, had me chuckling right along at the gross-out jokes and the obvious humor which is Stiller's forte and Vaughn's lovable lackluster character and well delivered one liners. Stiller's wife, Christine Taylor is the leading female unless you count Missi Pyle's incredibly large and scary 'other side of the Iron Curtain steroid type' woman who could certainly take the lead if she wanted it!<br/><br/>The best on screen has to go to the psychotic Patches O'Houlihan, Rip Torn and there are some great cameo's including Hank Azaria, William Shatner and even David Hasselhoff having a laugh at himself. Chuck Norris also pokes his nose in, as does Tour De France legend Lance Armstrong Â– who should stick to riding and leave acting to the pros. Finally a mention for Jason Bateman as Pepper Brooks, the Gen-X, extreme sports type commentator his delivery and performance is perfect.<br/><br/>Other support cast like Steve the Pirate, ably played by Alan Trudyk and Justin, Justin Long, with his horrible flashback to the cheer-leading incident keeps this movie rolling along. Many memorable moments and good laughs here, plus a bit of a surprise for the romantic side-plot, especially to the parents of the five year olds in the cinema.<br/><br/>7.5/10<br/><br/>*TIP* Hang round for the entire credits!"

La Fleur tries desperately to raise the cash to save his gym, but eventually bands together with the gym regulars to win the money they need via a Dodgeball competition.<br/><br/>Most of the jokes are visual with the script offering few outstanding moments.

","Making, much less seeing ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is bizarre, beyond the fringe of the most remote element in popular culture. The fact that the movie title includes a clarification that distinguishes it from perhaps the ""other"" Dodgeball movie is both ridiculous and unsettling. That being said, Writer and Director Rawson Marshall Thurber's ""Dodgeball"" is very stupid, and extremely funny. Vince Vaughn as Average Joe's Gym owner, Peter La Fleur, emerges as today's most talented comic straight man. This year Vaughn has appeared in smaller comic roles in such movies as ""Starsky and Hutch"" and ""Anchorman"". Vaughn has a cool and ease about him, always playing insightful in the midst of brain dead chaos. Dodgeball's world class stupidity is embodied in Peter's crew. Its paragon of stupid is White Goodman, owner of the rival Globo Gym. As played by Ben Stiller, White Goodman is dumber than a post. On a certain level, one has to admire Stiller's bold performance which is so over the top, that you can virtually hear the brain cells dying in White Goodman's head. Not only is White beyond the realm of stupid, he is also arrogant and completely self-absorbed. Yes, he is perhaps the most annoyingly funny character in all of movie-dom. In a clueless White attempt to seduce, Kate Veatch (cute and smart Christine Taylor), he asks her if she is okay. She responds, ""I just threw up in my mouth... a little."" Whoa. Kate is the bank auditor assigned to review Average Joe's Gym's financials. The gym is in foreclosure. White makes a hostile takeover attempt for Average Joe's, and for Kate. Kate, however is sympathetic to Peter, though everyone in Average Joe's think she is a lesbian. Go figure. <br/><br/>Where White's Globo Gym is for the ""beautiful"" people, Peter's Average Joe's Gym is not. Not at all. Peter asks high school member Justin (charming and geeky Justin Long), ""Wait, so you want to join the cheer leading squad so people don't think you're a loser?"" Peter's members are not an athletically inspired group. Okay, they are a bunch of pathetic losers-- athletically and socially. It is so absurd, that one of the guys thinks he's a pirate which goes unnoticed by most of the group. Peter must raise $50,000 or lose his gym to foreclosure, and eventually to Globo Gym. Fortunately, one of the guys, Gordon (very funny Stephen Root from ""Office Space""), discovers in his issue of ""Obscure Sports Journal"" that they could earn the money by winning the Dodgeball Tournament in Las Vegas. <br/><br/>After gaining a tournament seeding following a scandalous Girl Scouts match, the boys enroll legendary Dodgeball coach Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). Patches is apparently this Dodgeball Yoda in a wheelchair, uttering such sage advice as ""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball."" Kate (Taylor) demonstrates a special talent, and joins the team in their quest for Dodgeball glory. <br/><br/>My only familiarity with Dodgeball: The Game was as a grade schooler during recess and P.E. Then I saw Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn promoting ""Dodgeball"" on MTV providing color commentary at a Dodgeball Tournament. I was unaware of this whole sports culture. So when Thurber adds the winning combination of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as Dodgeball color commentators, Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks, on ESPN8 (the Ocho) the effect is no longer absurd. It becomes surreal. <br/><br/>""Dodgeball"" unexpectedly has the most funny inspiring speech I can remember from a movie. At the emotional arc of the movie, Lance Armstrong playing himself shares with Peter (Vaughn) that being diagnosed with brain, lung and testicular cancer drove him to win 5 Tour de Frances (at that time). He then asks Peter, ""So what are you dying of...?"" Classic. Then again Thurber's ""Dodgeball"" is full of surprises. The biggest one is that this stupid story is truly funny, for the most part clever, and has a unique charm. Even amidst the sometimes bottom of the barrel scraping humor, the movie has a genuine fondness for it's cast of lovable losers. We all pull for Peter and his team to reclaim the greatness deep inside themselves... buried very, very deep inside."

","""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" was a goofy, but hilarious movie that had me laughing all the way through. It was truly a story of underdogs proving that are just as likely to succeed, even if it is only by luck. Those who enjoyed ""Happy Gilmore"" may or may not enjoy this film - it depends if you like movies that have striking similarities to one you've seen before.<br/><br/>The main character in this film, White Goodman, is played by Ben Stiller, who was a nursing home orderly by the name of Hal in the 1996 film Happy Gilmore. In both films, he uses his power to his advantage, using every opportunity to make anyone feel bad. The striking similarities between the two films goes beyond this. The basic plot lines are essentially the same: the ownership of a large asset is threatened, the character takes up a sport they've never played before in order to win back that asset, and the champion of that sport, who is imminently to take over that asset, feels threatened and will do anything to stop them. In Happy Gilmore it was Grandma's house that was threatened; in this film it is a gym business. In the same sense, golf versus dodgeball.<br/><br/>In addition, product placements are found in this film, and they are sometimes the same as what is found in Happy Gilmore. Pepsi was seen a number of times in both films. Also, some golf events in Happy Gilmore were covered by ESPN, and in this film, the dodgeball championships in Las Vegas are covered by ESPN - ESPN 8 ""The Ocho"", that is.

It comes down to both gyms resulting in victory not by winning the match, but by cleaver trickery.<br/><br/>The critical intention from director Rawson Marshall Thurber is to prove that underdogs can overcome all odds. Even though they are shot down by White and have to work hard to prepare for the tournament, even they can result in victory using smart tactics to outsmart Globo Gym. Through this comedy, the story tells people that even if you are an underdog, it doesn't mean that you cannot overcome things. It also shows that no one is above anyone else even if they have more money. Intelligence overcomes all else.<br/><br/>There are many critical techniques used to present this funny story to viewers in the best way. Camera angles and lighting make the movie's moods more intense and exciting for viewers. Exciting music is also used to intensify the exhilarating competition. There seems to be bits of comedy placed at perfect spots in the movie to adequately create comic relief during rough times for the Average Joes.<br/><br/>With a creative plot, encouraging purpose, and fantastic film techniques, Dodgeball comes out on top of the summer's film listings. It is a great comedy that proves not to be a film underdog."

","I'll admit it, the only reason that I went to this movie was because it didn't cost me anything. I went to see Spider Man 2 at a drive-in, and it was a double feature. It was a work night, but I decided to give it a try - how bad could it be? Besides, I could always leave if I didn't like it.<br/><br/>It's a stupid movie, I'll admit that. But it is fun, it is funny, and is a great send up of the sports movie genre. Some of the reviewers are bound and determined to be offended, but it is a fun movie. The movie works well because it doesn't take itself seriously at all. Worthwhile if you are not in a serious mood, and especially worthwhile if you didn't pay for it.

","Dodgeball was funny, as long as you don't think too hard about it. However, if you want a better example of the turn-off-your-brain-and laugh movie go see Anchorman, as it is funnier, in my opinion. Ben Stiller is hilarious as the dense, insecure White Goodman, owner of GloboGym. Goodman is a cross between Stiller's earlier characters of Zoolander and the the evil nursing home attendant he played in Happy Gilmore. Vince Vaughn plays our hero, Peter LaFleur, a laid back slacker who owns and operates a ""competing"" gym called Average Joe's. He has to get $50,000 in 30 days or else he loses his gym to the obnoxious, nefarious Goodman. One of LaFleur's few clients, Gordon, comes up with the idea of competing in a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament where the grand prize is $50,000. This leads to countless shots of people getting hit in the crotch with dodgeballs, which as the producers of America's Funniest Home Videos, can attest is always funny. The tournament itself is funny, and appears on ESPN 8 or ""The Ocho"" as it is nicknamed. Gary Cole and Jason Bateman hilariously play the commentators. As far as Jason Bateman's character goes, think of a younger version of Fred Willard's character in Best in Show, and you will get the idea. The cameos are funny and include William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris, and the funniest one of all, Lance Armstrong. All in all it was funny, but could have been better. During the training montage, it would have been so much better, if they would have played a cheesy 80's style heavy metal song. obviously, when you go see a movie like Dodgeball, you don't expect Oscar material, but as long as you just don't think too hard about how stupid it is, it is definitely worth killing about an hour and a half.

Ben Stiller and co. seem to think that silly voices, old people cursing, and kicks to the groin are the building blocks of comedy. Over and over, in places where you expect a punchline, Stiller uses his Zoolander voice to repeat what another character has just said. He does this again and again and again. If we're lucky, we then get to see the love interest smash Stiller's head into the wall. Vince Vaughn looks sedated throughout the movie, and the screenwriters must have been visiting the same medicine cabinet."

Also,I'm sort of a fan of Ben Stiller,so any chance to see him go unleashed in a film is a welcome spectacle. I'd hardly call this a great film by any measure. It's sophomoric and contrived to a fault. The humor certainly isn't for everyone and the plot seems stolen from previous gross-out comedies like ""Kingpin"" and :BAseketball"". But the gags are so enthused and rapid-fire that you don't get a chance to dwell on the bad gags for the ones that do work(and quite a few do). Plus, Vince Vaughn's easy,relaxed comic presence counterbalances Stiller's unhinged bodybuilder freak tops out a cast that seems inspired in their playing basically one-note characters. A bonus is watching real-life wife of Stiller,Christine Taylor, having no problem resisting the advances of her husband's character. The celebrity cameos are cleverly inserted and some of the minor characters--most notably Bateman as a dense sports color commentator and Root as a meek member of Vaughn's gym and Dodgeball team--steal their scenes. Bottom line:this is a good,hearty laughfest(for those who appreciate raw,raucous,well-meant humor) that is a good comedy respite or palate-cleanser between summer blockbusters.       7 out of 10 stars."

Dodgeball is a hilarious movie full of laughs, sports and the ever needed bondage equipment. So how do you add to two great comedy actors like Ben Still and Vince Vaughn?

So how does a run of the mill gymnasium come up with the $50,000 that they need to save themselves from being leveled? Why dodge ball of course and so starts the hilarity, after all where else would you see four grown men and a woman losing to a group of girl scouts and still making it to Las Vegas for the dodge ball championships? Not in a Spielberg or Lucas movie that's for certain. That really is why these Stiller type movies do so well at the box office and more of it I say. So I have to say go ahead and watch this movie it really is a side splitting experience, go.go now because it's only your fault if you don't hate yourself enough to go watch Dodgeball."

","No other word can describe this movie. I was laughing from start to finish!<br/><br/>This is the kind of wacky sports comedy that ""Baseketball"" aspired to be, but failed miserably. It helps that the cast is first-rate. Ben Stiller gives what quite possibly may be his funniest performance yet! He's a genuinely versatile comedic actor, yet he seems to be stuck playing the shy, bumbling boyfriend in his most recent work. Just his look alone in this movie, with the handlebar moustache, will make you crack up. And Vince Vaughn is an underrated actor whose straight, deadpan delivery makes the jokes even funnier. There are plenty of hilarious gags that are still making me laugh just thinking about them. For example, the one where Rip Torn (who wonderfully plays a veteran of the dodge ball game) talks about drinking his own urine. You can classify a multitude of cameos as a cheap shot, but who cares? It's still entertaining. The cameos include everyone from David Hasselhoff to William Shatner to Chuck Norris. Since their names appear in the cast list, there's no use keeping their cameos a secret, but I won't give away where they appear. There's a gratuitous car wash montage involving beautiful girls in bikinis, and a dance number with bikini-clad dodge ball cheerleaders. So the movie is entertaining in all regards. If you're in the mood to laugh and laugh hard, ""Dodgeball"" is the movie to see.<br/><br/>There's some pretty low-brow stuff, yet it's not so low-brow that you feel like your intelligence is insulted.

","DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY is the surprising comedy about the owner of Average Joe's Gym, Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), who finds his gym wanting to be bought out by fitness mogul White Goodman (Ben Stiller) to add to the monolith that is his GloboGym. The only way to prevent his gym from being bought out is to somehow turn up with $50,000--which, needless to say, is quite a stretch. In a moment of genius, one of the gym's attendants, Gordon (Stephen Root), suggests they go to the Dodgeball Championships in Las Vegas and try to win the grand prize of (coincidentally) $50,000. The Average Joe's team assembles and, though they are lousy at first, win the required regional match and are in. With the help of retired dodgeball champ Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), the team improves and goes on to the Championships--where Goodman and his bunch of goons are also playing to try to stop Average Joe's from winning the prize.<br/><br/>Why is DODGEBALL a surprising comedy? Because it's actually hilarious. From the previews, I wouldn't have thought so. But they were misleading--this was an extremely funny film. The main credit should go to Ben Stiller, who was truly hilarious as Goodman. The facial expressions he makes in this movie are classic. Vince Vaughn is given what is, in my opinion, a boring role with few jokes, but he does great with it, as does the rest of the supporting cast with their roles. One of the best comedic ensembles I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>As for the comedy itself... the majority of the physical stuff is stupid. That's what made me think that it looked stupid from the previews--all that they showed was physical stunts. The getting-hit-in-the-balls gag is completely overdone, and used at least 10 times in this movie. The training scenes and the dodgeball games don't strike me as very funny; instead, it's the jokes and particularly Ben Stiller's character that made me crack up. My particular favorite scene involved the painting of the bull--the way it was painted made me almost fall out of my seat with laughter.<br/><br/>The story is overworked, but charming and cute. The outcome of the final dodgeball game is entirely predictable, but still manages to pose as a happy and satisfying end to the movie. The hookup between Peter and his lawyer Kate (Christine Taylor) is completely predictable as well, but this movie adds a funny spin on it. It does well with its plot and doesn't make it boring or uninteresting.<br/><br/>After seeing DODGEBALL, it may have just replaced MEAN GIRLS as the funniest movie I've seen recently. Surprisingly hilarious, minus the overdone and cluttering physical stunts. 8/10."

","As 'Dodgeball' opens we pan around the crummy living room of Vince Vaughn and find him snoozing on the couch as a TV infomercial (with the usual pitchman hyping exercise stuff) drones on in the background. He rises and in leisurely fashion begins his day, and like many of us, never seems to move any faster than at about sixty percent of his potential  for the rest of the movie. But this is perfect counterpoint to Ben Stiller's energetic creep-role, as we soon see.<br/><br/>Vaughn (Peter La Fluer) is owner of a less-then- state of the art ('Average Joe's') gym coveted (as a parking solution) by the owner of neighboring and rival GloboGym (Ben Stiller as White Goodman). We soon find that Average Joe's is in deep financial straits, and it follows, as in nearly all sports movies, that winning a prize is the only possible solution to this dilemma. Of course the team Vaughn assembles for the big Las Vegas Dodgeball Tournament is predictably a ragtag collection of social misfits; rival Ben Stiller in response fields a team of ringers to circumvent the success of Average Joe's. <br/><br/>While there are no real surprises in the outcome of the movie, the gags and one-liners we see and hear along the way make this a nice ride. Surprisingly there are a few references to homosexuality (generally movies either steer directly away from or head-on into this theme), and with the other blatant sexual innuendo peppered throughout 'Dodgeball' is a little edgier than the PG-13 rating indicates. <br/><br/>The only portion of 'Dodgeball' that is really striking is the introduction of the Las Vegas Tournament and the subsequent few minutes as we see teams (all the sides  and we remember dodgeball as a junior high rainy-day thing where we lined up on each side of the gym and pummeled each other - have themes) eliminated in rapid fashion. This is truly funny stuff, and a definite shift up in the imagination gears occurs. The film then downshifts to the previous rather leisurely pace at which it had been moving.<br/><br/>Vaughn is really the key actor in 'Dodgeball', although Stiller does give a fine effort as the revolting GloboGym owner. The work of the supporting cast (most notably Rip Torn, who in his career has done anything given the opportunity) does add to the overall number of laughs. Judging by the audience reaction (a nice mixed bag of kids, teens and older adults) 'Dodgeball' is about as funny as 'The Bad News Bears', which is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 Stars."

","I have no awful memories of dodgeball and I will have no awful memories of 'Dodgeball'. I had fun playing this simplest of school games and had fun breezing through this goof-fest of a movie. As the cliche goes, it's good for a laugh. Actually, it's good for plenty of laughs and that's far more than I can say for most joke-free comedies. It's five sticks of foolish fun. I don't know how they pulled it off, though, because this ridiculous material has no right to be as enjoyable as it is, especially since you know where it's heading from the opening credits. Cliches or not, the filmmakers make it work.<br/><br/>Slacker Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) owns a dive of a gym called Average Joe's. Muscle-twit White Goodman (Ben Stiller) owns the massive Globo Gym and intends to buy up La Fleur's business. To raise the $50,000 needed to pay the mortgage, a handful of members at Average Joe's enter a dodgeball tournament in Vegas. The jealous Goodman gathers super-jocks together to enter the same tourney. The lovely Christine Taylor (Kate Veach) is the third point of a humourous love triangle, who also proves to be a whiz playing the title game. Apart from a few twists and turns, the story follows the well-worn 'Rocky' path. It even takes some gentle jabs at the formula.<br/><br/>This flick proves once again that pratfalls are funny. Watching La Fleur's clumsy chums get pegged with red balls during Rip Torn's brutal training sessions, writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber treks to the well...but never goes there once too often. Stiller's insecure character hammers the same note, but he's still pretty funny in a very obnoxious role. Vaughn is about as relaxed as a piece of lunch meat, which goes against his usual high-strung style. The supporting cast members (including Stephen Root, who will always be Bill from ""King Of The Hill"" to me) don't leap past the stars, even though they all get to shine with lots of nerdy moments of comic stupidity.<br/><br/>What I found surprising is that many of the laughs hit you in the face a beat or two later. I expected that a movie with such obvious intentions would play all its cards right in front of you, but many of the jokes work best as rebounders and asides. Stiller and Vaughn must have called in some favours to get all the guest stars to do a cameo---some of them are great and some are unnecessary. In any case, 'Dodgeball' is a hoot without being a manic ""throw everything at the wall"" type comedy. There's nothing wrong with that, unless you hated the game as a kid. Then again, considering this is a ""true underdog story"", maybe inept dodgeballers can enjoy it too."

I supposed I would laugh occasionally, while easily following a basic, juvenilisitc comedy-driven plot.<br/><br/>Only half of my hypothesis was accurate. While the basic innerworkings of the movie were no more complicated than those of Tommy Boy, I found myself laughing with such rigor at times that I had to tear my eyes from the screen in an effort to slow my laughter and gulp down some oxygen. Even while serious, intentionally unfunny scenes took place, I sat staring eagerly at the screen with that oblivious, airheaded expression you sometimes catch on a dog when you're scratching him behind the ears.<br/><br/>I can say without hesitation that the funniest aspect of this movie is Ben Stiller's character, White Goodman. His mannerisms, gestures, and greatest of all, comebacks, are a marvel in themselves. His lines, while funny simply by nature, are expanded into humor bombshells as one line after the next hits you right in the funny bone.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie not only to anyone under the age of 18, for obvious reasons, but to adults alike for its over-the-top style and in-your-face attitude. With more cameos than you can count, I guarantee a night filled with laughter and enjoyment. Be sure to stick around for the credits. Trust me.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","This is too crude to be PG 13. I feel that all of the sexual innuendos were not necessary. I took my son (13) and his friend (13) to see this and I was appalled by its content. The story line on its own could have generated a decent film. The addition of the foul language and sexual innuendos detracted from the content. The ending with the girls being bi-sexual was also unnecessary. Let's not even mention the pizza scene. The sub-line (a true underdog story) is also misleading. It leads you to believe there may be some truth in the script. The only truth is that this movie is degrading to women, men and physically disabled persons, along with anyone who is not a beautiful, perfect specimen of a human being."
"BradBate","Null","0","0","2 July 2004"," Come late, leave early; only the second act is worth watching.
","Veteran character actor Rip Torn is the only reason I was able to get through this 'dumb and dumber' Ben Stiller 'comedy.' Torn appears at the beginning of the second act as wheelchair-bound Patches O'Houlihan, former world champion Dodgeball player, enlisted to coach a rag-tag team of neophytes, intent on winning a big Las Vegas tournament. When O'Houlihan begins throwing plumber's wrenches at the out-of-shape players as a training exercise, the laughs are huge and genuine. Unfortunately, the screenplay can't sustain the hilarity, and the movie dissolves into as routine an underdog sports flick as you have ever seen. The 'bad news bears' on a Dodgeball court.<br/><br/>Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is the lovable but inept operator of a small neighborhood gym. He is threatened with annihilation by White Goodman (Stiller), the egomaniacal but insecure CEO of a state-of-the-art health and fitness empire, with a location just across the street. Can Peter and his quirky band of misfit members find a way to raise $50-thousand in 30 days, or will Average Joe's Gym fall to the wrecker's ball and become a parking garage for Globo Gym's members? The answer is in winning the $50-thousand prize in a Dodgeball tourney.<br/><br/>This is the first feature from 29-year-old writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber. How he got his screenplay before Stiller and his band of co-producers is unknown to me, and how he managed to write a deal that allowed him to direct is more of a mystery. But he lived through it, and will probably become the next Tom Shadyak (whose directorial debut was 'Ace Ventura, Pet Detective'). Technically, his coverage was pitifully weak, which didn't help the comedy. But he got to work with enough veterans of this kind of low humor that he will be stronger on the inevitable 'Dodgeball 2.' From a critical standpoint, I think this is Stiller's fourth comedy turkey this year, but he must be pleasing someone; 'Along Came Polly' and 'Starsky and Hutch' both made money, as will this; only 'Envy' tanked. <br/><br/>Sometimes I think writing drek such as 'Dodgeball' may be easier than writing about it. It certainly is more lucrative."

Peter decides to give up on trying, until one of the members of his gym suggests that they compete in the annual Dodgeball Competition, with a cash prize of, you guessed it, $50,000.

The great Rip Torn (Larry Sanders Show) chews up the scenery and everyone does strong work. I do feel, however, that the only reason Christine Taylor is in the movie is because she IS Stiller's wife. She did dead-on funny work as Marcia Brady in the Brady Bunch Movies, but since then I always find her kinda drab and one-note. Stiller and Vaughn play off of each other quite well and the cameos by B-Level actors are hilarious!

There were quite a few ""hidden"" jokes that you had to pick up during the commentating on ESPN 8, which a lot of people missed. However, the story was extremely lame and drab, so don't see it for that. It was way too predictable, and was basically a thing that would never happen.

","I love hilarious and gut busting movies.  Unfortunately I did not think this movie fit either of those categories.  Do not get my wrong, I usually enjoy Ben Stiller's comedy but this movie did not work for me.  I thought I would be laughing uproariously but in fact for the first part of the movie I might have chortled at the most! <br/><br/>Ben Stiller does a fairly decent job as the megalomaniacal Globo-Gym owner, I especially enjoyed his over the top statements in which he would finish by saying, "" I'm just kidding....no I'm not"".  That was pretty funny but the rest of the movie was pretty stale.  Vince Vaugn is also a fairly good foil to Stiller's over the top performance.  The cast of 'average joe's' are just that, average and uninteresting.  The wannabe pirate guy was just annoying to say the least.<br/><br/>
The plot bothered me the most because the script writers put absolutely no effort into writing this story.  I would not have minded as much if there was a tongue in cheek, sort of ""wink, wink"" to the audience but I did not really see that.  The plot is just a narrow sort of progression to the final dodge ball tournament but nothing really interesting happens in between.  I guess the funniest part of the movie was people getting hit in the crotch and head with dodge balls.

Well, for some reason this enthusiasm died once the movie actually came out.<br/><br/>Then my buddy tells me it's hilarious and so today I took his word for it. He was absolutely right.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn plays a laid back kind of guy against Stiller's more aggressive conceited jackass. The teams they lead are both full of wacky characters and there are many funny bits throughout the entire film. The supporting cast, comprised of a few unknowns, were perfect in the parts they played.<br/><br/>Overall, the only negative thing I could say about ""Dodgeball"" would be Ben Stiller's performance. It seemed to me that he was trying to steal the spotlight from Vaughn. He just goes a little too far over the top here (although he does have a few great scenes and some classic lines, and if you stick around after the credits you will never think of the Milkshake song the same way again as long as you live).<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn definitely owns this one. His chemistry with Ben Stiller's real-life wife would be something Ben might want to keep in check, if you know what I mean.

","Dodgeball is a great sports comedy. If you can call dodgeball a sport. When you make a movie about the big spectator sports like baseball and football, there's only so far you can go because you have to stay withing the widely recognized rules of the game. When you have something like dodgeball you can go hog wild, because the event itself is already so over the top. Vince Vaughn is great as the too-nice-for-his-own-good owner of a small time gym that is, unfortunately, located directly across the street from Ben Stiller's Globe Gym wannabe. In an effort to save his business, he signs himself, and some of his regulars up in a dodgeball tournament to win enough money to get out of debt. Well Stiller's character will have none of that, and signs up his own team to stop them. There you go. That's the plot. It's as deep as a mouse's grave. The movie lives on the charm of it's two leads. Fortunately, Vaughn and Stiller are more than up to the challenge. Vaughn plays it relatively straight, but sneaking in the snide one liners with a smoothness that would make the like of Bill Murray and Chevy Chase proud. Stiller gives a severely over the top performance that perfectly fits the over the top character. If I had to say something negative about his performance, it's only that it's basically the same performance he gave as the demented, fitness crazed leader of a fat kids camp in the Dusney movie ""Heavyweights"". But he was so good there, I liked seeing a revisit of that character. Rip Torn is great as the old time dodgeball player whose coaching style will have you doubled over laughing. Chritine Taylor doesn't have much to do but look hot. But she's DAMN good at it. You are one lucky man Ben Stiller. Then there are the dodgeball games themselves. There are more than enough vicious hits, beanings, and low blows to have the audiences rolling in pain and laughter. Is it low brow humor? Of course. So when it comes on DVD, get your buddies together, get the chips, tap the keg, and set down with a double feature of this and BASEketball, and have a great old time."

","""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" was fairly entertaining. Essentially, that's my review, however, that may lead some people to believe that this is actually a good movie. It's not. Judged in the sense of cinema, this is a horrible movie. The screenplay is absolutely atrocious, most of the jokes are unfunny and rehashed bits (Did anyone see ""Baseketball""??? Same thing, but way better), bad acting, the whole nine. It's just a bad film. Plain and simple. But NOBODY went into the theater expecting to see ""Citizen Kane""! The thought of that is absolutely absurd. We came for cheap and stupid humor. Ben Stiller reprises his role of the nutty camp counselor from the 1995 gem ""Heavyweights"" and gets his totally smokin' hot wife Christine Taylor to play the token hottie that these movies typically have. Vince ""You used to be so money and you didn't even know it"" Vaughn's acting is noticeably terrible in this and I'm just thinking ""What happened? You were so awesome in 'Swingers."" But that doesn't matter because it's still funny, even though he's playing the straight man (to Ben Stiller's cheap penis pump/pizza masturbation jokes.) But who cares! That's entertainment!<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is, without a doubt (Much like in ""Best in Show"") the dodgeball tournament announcers, played by Harvey Birdman himself, Gary Cole and...well, the other guy's name is Pepper, and that is totally awesome. Their lines are the funniest, even though the whole bit is the same thing bit that was in ""Pootie Tang"" where one character makes a long, drawn out explanation of something and the other character says the exact same thing in two words.<br/><br/>There is one huge problem that is haunting this movie. That problem is the COMPLETE LACK OF DODGEBALL ACTION!!! I mean, our underdog team, the Average Joes play six games of dodgeball in the entire movie. Do we see any long, dramatic games of dodgeball? NO! It's like a highlights reel and totally weak. Gah, now I'm really starting to hate this movie, and thinking about it, if I was watching this alone and not with a big group, I'd have hated it to death. It's an awful film...but if you see it with a bunch of people that think it's funny, some of that entertainment will rub off onto you. Enjoy or suffer."

","""Dodgeball"" is going great guns at the box office as moviegoers with time on their hands in the summer and not enough first-rate flicks to see seek harmless, amusing entertainment that leaves little impression when the lights go on.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is an evil gym owner with a high tech operation who covets neighboring Average Joe's place, owned by a kind but incompetent businessman named...Joe. That's Vince Vaughn. Stiller's wife in real life, Christine Taylor, shows up-she's a bank attorney checking out Joe's messed up or really non-existent financial records.<br/><br/>Average Joe's will be seized for non-payment of a mortgage and snarling, pumped up, hyper Stiller wants the place for a parking lot. $50,000 will save the day and just by coincidence that's the prize purse at the national dodgeball championship to be held in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>You know the rest. Average Joe puts together a team of first-class nudnicks to win the prize money while the Global Gym creep confidently plans to snag the championship with his menacing crew. Of course Kate the lawyer winds up on Average Joe's team having rejected the slimy advances of his rival. It's a nice role for Taylor who has appeared mostly in B- minus films despite her highly respected and too little known breakthrough performance in 1996's ""Cat Swallows Parakeet and Speaks.""<br/><br/>The best role is that of wheelchair-bound once great dodgeball champ Patches O'Houlihan, played with vulgar gusto by the aging but still fine Rip Torn.<br/><br/>Director Rawson Marshall Tucker knew how to make a box office hit-whether he can do anything seriously engrossing is another question. Actually it isn't.<br/><br/>Does girl (lawyer) get boy (Average Joe morphing into a hunk)? You didn't think a low brow comedy like this would skip the inevitable romance, did you? Well the ending surprised - and clearly upset (ha ha) - some of the parents in the theater.<br/><br/>Lance Armstrong and Chuck Norris do cameos with Armstrong flatly recounting his medical history. He can ride but he can't act.<br/><br/>Amusing, slight madcap sports film with some funny lines and some good physical comedy-that's all.<br/><br/>6/10."

","Possible Spoilers?? My movie enjoyment meter registered as Major Disappointment after seeing Dodgeball. This has got to be the most stupid movie I have ever seen. I had seen the trailer and shouldn't have been surprised. It is another Ben Stiller movie where his talent as an actor is overshadowed by sophomoric humor. The theatre was 1/3 full on a typical summer weekday and the only people laughing were the 11 and 12 year olds; the adults just looked embarrassed. Even the YAMs (young adult males) weren't laughing. The gags were old, yeah maybe the wrenches were a little funny (how COULDN'T they dodge the wrenches??), but the rest were just sad.<br/><br/>Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate was the brightest spot in the entire movie; his realization that he wasn't a pirate was a classic, right up there with Stan Laurel. I hadn't seen him in anything since ""28 Days"" and was pleasantly amused at his performance in Dodgeball. The rest of the cast? Forget it. It was clear that none of the rest of the cast had to stretch their acting talents to be in this movie. When is Ben Stiller going to realize that he can leave this type of script on the reject pile? It has gotten to the point where it is a waste of money to see him in a comedy since it is the same thing over and over. Ben, listen up...look up the word ""subtle"" and try to apply it to your next project. And stop trying to ""dumb down"" your audience--you have talent, try to use it."

See this movie to laugh 'till you are shaking in your seat. This movie uses the standard underdog plot with tongue in cheek. The group of ""Average Joes"" were likable and the villain was despicable, and all were outrageous stereotypes. But the really purpose of this movie was the slapstick. The constant barrage of jokes (somewhat obscure sexual references, dork humor, and puns) keeps you laughing the whole time. Ben Stiller was hilarious but doesn't hog the spotlight.

"gregsrants","7","0","0","22 June 2004"," I laughed...and that says a lot
","Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story Stars<br/><br/>Let's get one thing perfectly clear before we even start. I had no intentions of seeing Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. None. Forking over a double-digit cash sum to be reminded of the welts I used to get in junior high playing the ridiculous game was of absolutely no appeal. Couple that with Ben Stiller playing yet another character that is so over the top that I won't know whether to laugh or to feel sorry for the guy, and I had a recipe for a long sit through.<br/><br/>However, my trains all lined up perfectly and it was too nice of a day to waste it outside on a patio somewhere, so there I was, standing at an automated ticket counter, scanning my bank card to purchase a ticket for a movie that that I was surprised to see Ebert & Roper give two thumbs up. (By scanning, I don't have to say the title out loud and embarrass myself in a crowd).<br/><br/>Dodgeball has the most simplistic of stories to understand. Man needs money to save gym. Man enters team into tournament. Man wins tournament and gets the woman. In short, I guess the premises of the film could have been written on cave walls some 7000 years ago, and based on its brand of humor..it just may have.<br/><br/>The 'man' is Peter LeFleur played by Vince Vaughn, he of Starsky & Hutch, Zoolander and any other film that a Stiller or an Owen brother is attached. <br/><br/>Peter owns a local gym that has caught the eye of White Goodman (Stiller) the driving force behind a state of the art gym facility that is franchised across the street. Due to accounting ignorance, Peter's gym, Average Joe's, is in financial woe and Goodman buys the second mortgage leaving Pete with the only option of amassing $50,000 in 30-days to save the establishment. So determined to be the David to the Goodman's Goliath, Peter and his friends come up with the hair-brained idea of entering a Dodgeball contest in Las Vegas in hopes of brandishing the prize money to thwart the bank's foreclosure. <br/><br/>But things are not as easy as it would seem, and dodgeball is not like the game you and I might remember from the day. The rules are pretty much the same. Six balls, five players per team. Hit the person on the other side of the court and they are out. Catch a ball and you can get one of your members back in. But that is where the similarities end. Teams now consist of rugged, fierce characters with each team having a theme (girl scouts, kamikazes etc). Dodgeball is now a spectator sport with qualifying rounds and a 32-team tournament that even has ESPN 8 interested with coverage. In short, it's come a long way, baby.<br/><br/>So the stage was set for what was an inevitable set up pitting team Average Joe against the team fielded by Gobo Gym's, Goodman. Bring on the balls!<br/><br/>Dodgeball made me laugh. Plain and simple. Stupid? Yes. But funny? Definitely. If it wasn't chuckling to myself when instructor Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) is training the young group by having them dodge wrenches, I was laughing out loud at the best commentary during a sporting event (courtesy of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman) since Bob Uecker in Major League. From Stiller's ridiculous Goodman to Vaughn's straight man Peter, there is a perfect mix of characters and comedy that might just make this film a bigger hit this summer than the studio anticipated.<br/><br/>Still not convinced? Well how about cameos by William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong and even German adored David Hasselhoff. Each of these bit parts were non-gratuitous and damn down funny. To watch Lance give a speech on how he was diagnosed with four areas of cancer at the same time and yet still managed to win the Tour de France for five straight years is self-depreciating acting at its finest without degrading the actual person.<br/><br/>To recommend Dodgeball at the office water cooler is to guarantee yourself a reputation as someone who's opinions ought to be questioned. But if you strip the movie down to just its essentials (that is, take the love story out, cause you know how that is going to end. Take the suspense of what decision Pete is going to make, cause you know how that is going to end), then the movie is a great way to spend a day during the summer with some friends. For trust me, in about 6 months time, everyone will be talking about how they rented this movie and laughed alongside their friends and loved ones at the same carnage that brought me sympathy in Junior High. Besides, what other sport could have a team motto as fun as 'Aim Low'?"

","Alright, we know it's Ben Stiller and we know it's Vince Vaughn. This looks like an Old School meets Heavyweights at first. However, I still recommend this movie to every comedy fan. The movie has the outright physical humor of people getting hit in the head and groin with rubber balls, but has the subtle humor as well. At first, Vaughn isn't very convincing as his character and seems like he's just there to deliver the punch-line. However, the quick one-liners by Vaughn matched up against the increasingly idiotic (but humorous) responses from Stiller combine for some memorable scenes. The actual plot is predictable, but this surprisingly does not take away from the comedy. The supporting cast may lack in acting skills, but builds a good foundation for the ongoing jokes in the movie. If you liked Old School, and the good Stiller comedies, then go see this one."

First time director Rawson Marshall Thurber, the creator of one of greatest ad campaigns of all time with Terry Tate, Office Linebacker for Reebok, scores big at the box office and on the laugh charts in his feature debut.  The story is extremely simple, the gags are alternately crude and clever, and Ben Stiller turns in perhaps his greatest performance of all time.  There isn't a lot to say except that it is very funny from start to finish.  If you like comedies in the mold of the Farrelly Brothers, you will certainly like this.

This is no high brow humor movie - there is little brain work needed to watch, so I would say drop your maturity down a few notches and you will appreciate the art of slapstick. There are some brief celebrity appearances that are fun to watch too, and this is the first Stiller movie I laughed out loud the whole time since Zoolander.

There have been one or two one-off successes like Tommy Boy, or Happy Gilmore.  I still have not laughed as hard at ANY movie as I did during those.  Vince Vaughn plays virtually the same character here in Dodgeball as he does in every movie (which is fine I guess), but Stiller plays a cross between his Zoolander character and Arnold Schwarzneggar.

","Spoofs are what started stupid humor, back in the seventies.  But as time went on, spoofs started sucking themselves, and the Dumb Movie was created. The Dumb Movie is the type of film that has loads of stupid spoof-like humor, but isn't spoofing anything in particular.  Most of the time the Dumb Movie is awful, but rarely it is effective, fun and very, very funny. `Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' is one of those times.<br/><br/>The plot is basically unimportant, as the film is mostly an episodic collection of slapstick humor, but I'll explain it anyway.  Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughan) owns a workout gym called `Average Joe's', which has a very small number of members, all of which are burned out losers.  None of the members have paid a membership fee in quite a while, and soon lawyer Catherine Veach (Christine Taylor) is telling La Fleur that if he doesn't pay fifty thousand dollars in thirty days, the gym will be transformed into a parking lot for the much larger Globo Gym across the street, run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller).<br/><br/>La Fleur and the rest of the losers decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas, the prize money conveniently being fifty thousand dollars.  Of course, there's one thing wrong: they all suck at playing dodgeball.  Seeing them lose against a team of girl scouts inspires legendary player Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) who's in his eighties and confined to a motorized wheelchair to round them up and teach them how to play.<br/><br/>I can't think of any other actor that could play O'Houlihan than Rip Torn. He plays it on just the right level of Over-the-Top, you know no one like this could ever exist, but he's still somehow believable.  It must be his booming, raspy voice and his angry facial expressions.  He's definitely one of the funniest aspects of the film.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good too.  Vaughan plays his character straight: he's unenthusiastic, pessimistic, and lazy but still a nice guy and he makes a good hero for the film.  The rest of the losers  including a middle aged nerd (Stephen Root), a very unconfident high schooler (Justin Long) and a guy who thinks he's a pirate (Alan Tudyk)  are all played well, they're not too crazily over the top to be unbelievable.  The only actually bad performance comes from Christine Taylor, who is mostly unnecessary and rarely funny.<br/><br/>The film's best performance comes from Ben Stiller as White Goodman, a man so insecure he pumps up his muscles (and an inflatable crotch too), tortures himself if he even thinks about eating junk food and surrounds himself with huge muscle-bound guys to look even tougher.  He doesn't realize he's insecure, though.  Instead he thinks he's confident, always trying to sound smart but only succeeding in contradicting himself over and over again.  The performance is flawless; it's one of 2004's best so far.  If ever there were a spoof performance that was worthy of an Oscar, this would be it.<br/><br/>Though the film is driven by its over the top characters it's not only them that's funny.  The dodgeball matches are gut-wrenching hilarity too, for some reason you manage to laugh every single time someone gets hit with something.  It never gets old.<br/><br/>As for the plot and depth of the characters, well, this is a Dumb Film, that's not important.  Director Thurber knew this, and didn't bother much with those details.  He knows the plot is bad though, as is made clear when the huge trunk of money La Fleur's team win at the end is labeled in big yellow letters `Deus ex Machina', invoking laughter from the more intellectual types in the audience.<br/><br/>This is the best form of pure, dumb summer fun, a recommendation to all, 7/10."

Vince Vaughn did a great job playing the straight man to all of the weirdos he's surrounded by, and I was surprised because a few of the actors made me care what happened to their characters. That's not easy to do with a script that isn't concerned about the depth of the characters.

It is a run-down facility and its members fit the loser bill quite nicely. Stiller plays White Goodman, the owner and operator of Globo Gym, which is a state-of-the-art health center run by snobs and chiseled goons. Basically LaFleur is in debt with the bank and he has 30 days to pay off the 50,000 dollars or else he loses the gym to Goodman. Stiller's off-screen wife Christine Taylor plays Kate Veach, who is the accountant from the bank in charge of handling the settlement. LaFleur and the guys decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas which guarantees a 50,000 dollar payoff to the winner. Goodman enter Globo Gym in the same tournament to thwart their chances. After rejecting Goodman's advances, Kate decides to join Average Joe's team and turns out to be a secret weapon. That is all the storyline you need to know. Rip Torn plays Patches Hoolahan, an old dodgeball player who decides to ""train"" the Average Joe team. His methods are a bit unorthodox to say the least, as they involve dodging wrenches and oncoming cars. Once the film gets to the dodgeball action, it is filled with crotch shots and blistering body shots. Throw in a little romance between Vaughn and Taylor and you've got yourself a classic 80's style movie. Stiller is hilarious as the testosterone-charged Goodman and his facial expressions had me laughing the whole time. Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are a nice touch as the commentators at the tournament and William Shatner,David Hasselhoff, and Chuck Norris provide pleasing cameos. Hollywood doesn't make many movies like this anymore and it's a shame because this one works on most levels.<br/><br/>P.S. Remember: Dodge,Duck,Dip,Dive,Dodge!!!"

","Sure, the very concept of making a movie about dodgeball, and one with a good chunk of it devoted to watching people play dodgeball, sounds like one of the most asinine ideas ever conceived for a movie, but then again movies have also been made about a duck from a parallel universe with a duck-themed version of the earth coming to the regular human-version of the earth and the ensuing culture clash, adaptations of terrible 60's cartoons about prehistoric blue-collar families or an idiotic group of teenagers, their rascally dog, and their fabulous van solving mysteries involving haunted amusement parks, as well as one about a guy and girl who have a tormented relationship and undergo a futuristic form of treatment to have each other erased from their memories, only to eventually get back together, and repeat the process over and over again. Alright, that last one was swell, as is Dodgeball, the little dodgeball movie that could. For a movie about what this movie is about, it couldn't possibly be any better. It's one of those rare comedies that maintains a strong level of laughs all the way through, many of them being of the best kind, the random, unexpected bizarro gags that always drive audiences wild! Why anyone would think the vastly inferior BASEKETBALL is better than this is beyond me. While both are spoofs of traditional sports movies, Dodgeball tells a real story with real characters we root for and in some cases, especially in the case of Steve the Pirate and Patches O'Houlihan, that we haven't seen before.<br/><br/>BASEKETBALL, on the other hand, is just bits of pieces of other spoof movies, with no real creative pulse of its own, and a result, despite the sterling work of master actor Bob Costas, is wildly uneven, and after about ten minutes or so, pretty damn boring.<br/><br/>Where Dodgeball flies by with its own goofy sense of itself, BASEKETBALL plods, taking us on a lame journey to nowhere particularly interesting. If you like your movies watered down and half-assed, (the game of BASEKETBALL, the basis of the movie, isn't particularly funny, and doesn't even make much sense), then BASEKETBALL is the one for you, or just watch MAJOR LEAGUE or any of its sequels, which are more or less the same movie, and are just about as uneven and not worth your time.

However, I still loved it. It was hilarious. The random sports they made upsquirrel water skiing, midget tossing...*snicker* And that they weren't afraid to go to the disturbing place...with pizza...it was really quite funny.<br/><br/>Why am I raving? I had ultra-low expectations. It made me laugh solidly from opening to closing credits. Good times.<br/><br/>And now, to rave about my reason for attending the movie: Alan Tudyk. Yes, he played a man who thought he was a pirate. He played a character that the writers were clearly high when they thought up, but (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>* ...when he was hurt and made fun of...well I actually felt bad. I felt bad for the freaking pirate-man! I was amazed that any actor could do anything with that part. That he could create an emotional connection impressed me. I mean, the guy was a freaking pirate-wannabe! <br/><br/>*<br/><br/>**<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>END SPOILERS<br/><br/>Don't think that I'm easily impressed by movies. I'm not. Normally a movie like Dodgeball would get nothing but scorn and derision from me...but I really enjoyed it. Definitely a great bad movie. Anyone who needs a laugh, go, don't expect too much, and enjoy!"

","This movie was by far the funniest movie i have seen in a long time. From start to finish I just couldn't stop laughing. Ben Stiller plays a ridiculously hilarious character, and there are many other notable performances be Vince Vaughn and others. Words cannot describe the hilarity that is dodgeball. I recommend everyone go see it, it is just great, the characters are all great in their own odd ways, such as Steve the Pirate. The movie starts out with a just brilliant opening commercial. I recommend that everyone see this movie, no matter what genre you are into, you will find something in this movie to laugh about, be it the characters, or the genius humor you will instantly fall in love with a sure fire classic comedy in Dodgeball."

","Baseketball was good (I re-watched it last night after watching Dodgeball yesterday afternoon) but it wasn't nearly as funny as Dodgeball. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are better left to voice-overs and using scissors then actual comedic acting, especially when it comes to sarcasm; Vince Vaughn is the king of that, and he shines in that role as normal. <br/><br/>If you can put up with Ben Stiller being a character that just makes you cringe, like him in Zoolander, then you can deal with his obnoxiousness in this movie. A lot of people liked Zoolander. I sure didn't, I think he was funnier in more traditional comedies like Something about Mary and Meet the Parents. Also, was he wearing a body suit? I never heard of someone putting on muscle for a comedic role. Anyway, obnoxious as he was he still made me laugh. The rest of the cast were funny also, Milton Waddams from Office Space was in there, I couldn't stop thinking about Swingline staplers when I saw him. Also, I always thought Marcia Brady might have been a carpet muncher. Sexy box licker though. The rest of the cast were all nobodies, kind of like me, so they were all right.<br/><br/>10/10 in the slapstick comedy genre"

","As I'm prone to being obsessive, I've of course already seen Dodgeball. I must warn you, if you don't like homoerotic humor, puns (which I don't usually, but they're so obviously bad and knowingly bad that i loved them), and humor that's derived solely from people being pegged in various body parts by big rubber red balls, this is not your movie. It's an utterly stupid, asinine movie, and I left the theater with a huge grin on my face and my sides hurting from laughing so much. The theater was full of people laughing, and guffawing at particularly hard hits, and it made it a wholly wonderful experience. Ben is utterly hysterical in this character. Vince is as well, in his usual acerbic sharp quick tongued way that he's perfected. Christine is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious. It's all around hysterical, but only if you're willing to leave any portions of your brain that wants intellectual humor at the door.<br/><br/>That being said, the writer is wonderful. The word play, the dialogue, the commentators for the dodgeball commentary... wonderful. Seriously wonderful writing. I have no doubt that should the writer (whom I'll be looking up now that i've reminded myself to) decide to do a movie that's less based on 'stupid humor' that he'll turn out a wonderful script that's hilarious on that level as well. I don't know how much of it is the writer or how much is the adlibbing, but if it's the writer, he's extremely talented.<br/><br/>And I have to say, Jason Bateman is one of the commentators for the tournament, and while there are many many one liners that are quotable in this movie, I'll be quoting him the most I think. He was wonderful. ""Ouch-town, population YOU, bro!"""
"driver_8","8","0","0","18 June 2004"," Stiller makes it fly
","OK, this might be a paint by the numbers, summer flick. You have the routine<br/><br/>good guys vs. bad guys. You have the ""if only we could win this tournament, we could...."" Yes, in that respect, this film is not creating anything too new. However, where this film succeeds, where so many others like it fail, is due to the great Ben Stiller. Stiller plays an outrageous, narcissistic, borderline homosexual, bad guy. When Stiller is on the screen, laughter abounds. Somewhat strangely, he is not on the screen as much as you think he would be. This movie is told around Vince Vaughn's character, who is trying to hold on to his sleepy little gym, which is being threatened for takeover by Stiller's ""Globo-Gym."" Vaughn reluctantly agrees to enter a dodgeball tourney to win the $50,000 Grand Prize. Of course, $50,000 is the exact amount him and his oddballs that call the gym home, need to keep it. Well, it is a summer Hollywood film, so you can guess what happens. There are some really nice cameos here and the film is entertaining. Is it as brilliant as ""Zoolander""? No, but it is better than ""Starskey and Hutch."" I guess that is something."

"movieguy1021","7","0","0","18 June 2004"," Dodgeball: 7/10
","There's nothing greater in comedies than people being hit in the groin. Expand that into 90 minutes and you've got the basic plot of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. No, strike that. It's 90 minutes of groin hits, Ben Stiller being stupid (it's what he does best), and wrench throwing. But in silly, uncomplicated comedies like this, anything slapstick works, and most of the movie does. Sure, it's no slapstick classic, but from a rookie writer/director (Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also did the successful ""Terry Tate: Office Linebacker"" ad during the Super Bowl), it's far from bad.<br/><br/>Peter (Vince Vaughn) owns ""Average Joe's"" gym, a rundown shack of a place which is unfortunate enough to be next to corporate Globo Gym, run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Average Joe's is in danger of closing unless it gets $50,000. The ragtag gym regulars decide to start a dodgeball team and go to Vegas for a dodgeball tournament, where the winners get (surprise, surprise) $50,000. But White makes his own team as they go head-to-head. Kate (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife) is thrown into the mix and eventually joins the Average Joe's.<br/><br/>Unlike most movies now, most of Dodgeball's jokes were not in the trailers. The funniest character has to be Patches (Rip Torn) as a paraplegic former Dodgeball champion who trains the Average Joes. Every line he says is insulting and derogatory, but he's really very funny. Second is Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk), a guy on the team who, well, thinks he's a pirate. That's about all I'll spoil, because most of it is new and clever. Sure, like all comedies, it drags towards the end (and becomes drawn out and dramatic), but in general, the second half had more laughs than the first. Most of them were either from Stiller (his best role since...uh...Starsky and Hutch?) or being hit by balls. Sure, it got old, and the sound effect they always used was annoying, but it was still quite funny.<br/><br/>Thurber seems to know how to balance the characters (such as which characters are the most important so those characters get development), and it really shows. It's hard to really explain, but you'll see if you go to the movie. Yet he can't keep away from the typical romance. Kate and White/Peter have such throwaway romances that they aren't even worth talking about. In fact, this whole movie is a throwaway movie. It's very funny, but you probably won't remember that you even saw it soon after. Except for Stiller's ""Joanie loves Chachi!"" It's seen in the trailers and it's probably the funniest line in the movie due to the context. Overall, Dodgeball is not a memorable movie, but quite a funny one, and it's worth seeing.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for rude and sexual humor, and language."

As for the rest of the cast, Stephen Root does good as usual with the skittish man role, while Justin Long's character (aptly named Justin) is a clone to his role of Warren P. Cheswick on the now defunct TV show Ed. He gave me the most laughs of the cast anyway, but one wonders if he is going to be type cast in that role of the nerdy young man who makes you cringe when he talks to the most popular, prettiest cheerleader in school. (They might as well have named Amber ""Jessica,"" a reference any Ed fans will get)<br/><br/>The two cast members that added a bit of silliness were Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate (the name says it all) and Rip Torn as the aged Patches O'Houlihan. Torn has some of the best lines of the whole movie, which makes me want to see it again just to catch them, because there were so many I can't remember them all.<br/><br/>A key scene to catch is the Dodgeball film from Justin's PE Class, made by Uber-American Films.

Though I anticipated the slurry of clichés, here they seemed more poorly executed than ever. Ben Stiller's performance was painful to endure - someone should tell him he's not untouchable. Jokes are rather sparse, but when they do appear, it is more often than not a woefully unfunny double entendre with the word 'ball(s)'. The stereotype of an East European woman is a joke that got old a long time ago, given that it was ever funny. I think the turning point (i.e. that which coerced me to turn the DVD off in place of getting my money's worth) was seeing Lance Armstrong's tastelessly misguided cameo.

Vince Vaughn basically mopes throughout the whole movie, and for the life of me I can't understand why I should even know his name. The supporting characters should have arguably been the highlight of the movie - funny, memorable, lovable, etc. Instead, they are all barely memorable and scarecely believable hangers on, each actor hoping to coat tails of one of the others' successful characters.

I at least expected it to be funny like Old School. This was no Old School. Not even close. All the jokes were cheap and crude. Sometimes that works for me but it didn't in this movie. Endless jokes about sexual orientation and stereotypes that I found rather offensive. Stiller is once again playing a doufus and is not funny. I used to be one of his biggest fans but he hasn't been in a decent movie since Keeping the Faith. Vaughn is the only bright spot in this. Some people lap this kinda comedy up. I guess I just get spoiled watching genuinely funny movies that are clever like Caddyshack, Animal House, Old School."
"ted_","1","3","8","7 July 2004"," Stupid Humor is Fine, But...
","...this is ridiculous. I have no problem with so-dumb-it's-funny humor (love Steve Martin), and it's extremely rare that I find any joke at all offensive (love Sam Kinison). Somehow, I found this film beyond stupid (even after 3 beers) and often squirmingly offensive (the stereotypes of Asians and Asian-Americans - of which my date was one - were not only insulting, but committed the equal sin of not even being funny). Of course you go to a movie called ""Dodgeball"" with low expectations, but it managed to miss even the lowest. Have you ever been in a movie and wanted to scream, ""When is somebody going to do something funny?! Please?! Anyone?!"" Lots of talented actors and a goofily promising premise is wasted in an utterly, completely, totally dreadful script that could well have been written by a thirteen-year old of below-average intelligence. No offense intended to anyone who liked this film. And maybe it just caught me on the wrong night. But this is the one time that an IMDb rating (6.8) steered me completely wrong. This is the closest I've ever come to walking out of a movie, and thought you needed to be warned."
"mattrochman","1","3","9","27 September 2007"," One of the best examples of how pathetic modern comedy is
","Well all I can say is that this sort of comedy film is typical for our times: moronic, thoughtless, star-struck, politically correct and worst of all, unfunny.<br/><br/>On one hand, I can count the number of films in the past 7 years that have genuinely made me laugh on one hand. Everything else tends to be films where everyone says ""you've gotta see it... it's so funny"" and then when you actually sit through it, you either can't wait for it to end or you turn it off. Dodgeball was no exception to the rule.<br/><br/>The screenwriters must have burst a blood vessel in their brain coming up with the misfit underdog formula and once they had put the finishing touches on this trite, they handed it over to the casting agent who looked no further than the dreadful Ben Stiller to fly across the screen as the moronic and ultimately unfunny adversary. <br/><br/>The fact that this crap made so much money is a sad indictment on the general public's taste in comedy.<br/><br/>And I'm still waiting for a Ben Stiller film that I actually like."

"megandavis","1","3","9","21 January 2006"," What were they thinking?
","I seriously usually like oddly humorous movies. I like comedy. But I don't believe this even qualifies as a movie. If this is the future of comedy, it is also one step closer to the end of civilization as we know it. Any movie that considers its main attraction as bombarding grown men with dodge balls over and over again humorous needs to get a reality check. The plot line was completely predictable, and nothing came as a surprise. All in all, this movie is an insult to those who watch it.<br/><br/>I know some people found this to be humorous, and I could see that it might appeal to some preteens with an obnoxious sense of humor. But there is a credit to go out to those who find it as obnoxious as I did."
"The_Void","6","2","5","6 December 2005"," Makes for an entertaining hour and a half
","Films starring Ben Stiller tend to be funny, and that's what this is. You cant go into a film like Dodgeball expecting much more than a good time and a few laughs - so the fact that it's no masterpiece won't disappoint, and the fact that it delivers exactly what you want it to ensures this further. Dodgeball is at least somewhat original because it follows a sport that (to my knowledge) hasn't been done before, or at least not recently. Prior to seeing this movie, I had seen Dodgeball being played 'professionally', and it's easy to see why the filmmakers here decided to base this comedy on that sport. It isn't quite as ridiculous in real life as it's portrayed as being here, but seriously - it's not all that far off. The film follows two rival gyms - the huge Globo Gym, and the small-scale local gym - Average Joe's. Joe's is owned by Vince Vaughn, who finds himself in trouble with the bank when it turns out he hasn't been paying his bills. He owes $50,000, and after his friends' idea to wash cars fails miserably, they find that the only way to pay off the bank and keep the gym open is to enter a dodgeball competition, which has a first prize of $50,000 (mere coincidence). However, the owner of Globotech wants Average Joe's for himself...and enters the competition to make sure that happens.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly Ben Stiller's biggest fan, but it's impossible to deny that he has a talent for comedy. He's shown in his recent films that he has a great range - from the very straight Starsky, to his average kind of role in Meet the Parents; all the way to his role here, which sees him as the maniacal fitness freak turned dodgeball player. He stars along with Vince Vaughn and wife, Christine Taylor. Vaughn has shown his comedy talent a lot recently, and even though his role here is merely as an average kind of guy; he does it well. Stiller's wife definitely is hot - I don't like blonde's as a rule, but every man who doesn't would have to make an exception here. She steals all of her scenes. Many of the jokes come as a result of Stiller's over the top character, and the general silliness of the game; dodgeball. It doesn't take a highly trained eye to notice that this is Ben Stiller's film - and it's him that you're going to remember most after seeing this film, and that is testament to his comical abilities. Some of the humour is a bit grating and doesn't really work (like the awkward romance between some ugly woman and a dorky kid), but on the whole - this is suitably silly, and is sure to sufficiently entertain most people."
"aimless-46","5","2","5","10 April 2005"," Oddly Uneven
","Dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldn't find his car.<br/><br/>""Dodgeball is a sport of violence, exclusion, and degradation"". I can personally relate to this movie. Growing up in the midwest we were forced to play it often, as early as age six. Hopefully its involuntary school version is just a Midwestern thing (Ohio, Michigan, Illinois) because it is truly a sport of ""violence, exclusion, and degradation""; which I can now look back on and laugh about (at least a little).<br/><br/>I think Stiller got the concept from his Michigan friends who made it a great sequence in the ""Freaks and Geeks"" pilot episode.<br/><br/>But it would be hard to come up with another movie that is as uneven (hit and miss) in its humor.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything involving Patches works extremely well; and works for both the Hank Azaria and the Rip Torn versions of the character. In fact these are some of the greatest comedy and dialogue bits ever. ""No, but I do it anyway because it's sterile and I like the taste"".<br/><br/>There are also a lot of funny animations and graphics, some great stuff that comes totally out-of-the-blue; like ""thank you Chuck Norris"" said with sincerity and the Lance Armstrong bit at the casino bar.<br/><br/>The good stuff is almost entirely at the middle of the film. There is absolutely nothing in the first 20 minutes of interest but stay with it because it gets better. Likewise the last 20 minutes is a letdown although the tournament announcers/commentators (Jason Bateman and Gary Cole) do a pretty good parody of too slick sports broadcasting. And it was a nice touch to have David Hasselhoff as the abusive German coach.<br/><br/>They reach for some cheap lesbian laughs which culminates with the tired draw of girls kissing.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn is likable and relaxed but it would be a stretch to call his stuff 'acting'.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is the main source of the misses. His 70's fitness freak never really works and the more you see the less funny it gets. Only the scenes with his ""real-life wife"" Christine Taylor are worth watching. Stiller just doesn't have the talent for exaggerated humor and the writer gave all the good lines to the other characters.<br/><br/>The supporting cast that I have not yet mentioned are lame and unimaginative. Since it is a comedy I assume that ""Steve the Pirate"" is supposed to be funny but you can't tell that by how he looks or what he says. Julie Gonzalo plays her same cheerleader character from ""A Cinderella Story""; since the films were produced at the same time she may have just walked back and forth between the sets without having to do a costume change.<br/><br/>The big mystery is why the creative talent behind ""Dodgeball produced so much great stuff and then did nothing worthwhile with the rest of the movie."
"itsacoofoo-1","Null","2","5","29 July 2004"," We live in a land of idiots.
","That must be the only explanation of why this movie is loved by so many. Vince Vaughn, while funny in Old School, gives a very unmotivated performance in this disgusting excuse for American cinema. Ben Stiller, pulling out one of his two characters in his arsenal, not only isn't funny, but makes you actually hate this man. I think I actually laughed more at watching CNN's coverage of the Democratic National Convention. I'm not sure what to think of a public who enjoys watching endless clips of a nerd getting hit with a ball. Or the idea of thinking that echoing a previous line (a la ben stiller) is funny! And the sad part is that I am not making this up. Two girls in front of me could not stop laughing at Stiller's mimicking characteristics. For the sake of our society, I hope they were high.<br/><br/>However, there is a bright side to all of this. If movies like ""Dodgeball"" can succeed in making tens of millions of dollars, a man like me with no experience in the field should be able to make a solid $10 million. All I have to do is mix a well-known cast with physical 'comedy' and I should be a shoe-in for Ben Stiller's next movie. Who cares if I let some 6th grader writes the script? As long as I add enough shots of people getting kicked, hit, or punched in the genitalia, I should be OK. Oh, and throw in a lesbian kiss between two hotties and I'll have 21st Century Fox drooling for the rights to my movie. I mean, if two hot women kissing is what it has come down to, then I think we have entered a new era of Hollywood bullcrap.<br/><br/>* out of **** (the one star thanks to that lesbian kiss.)"

","Dear Hollywood,<br/><br/>Is it THAT tremendously hard to make a movie wherein you have a bisexual character who is not a slut? This movie was utterly uneventful for the most part, and I almost didn't watch the last ten minutes. Morbid curiosity, much like one that makes one slow down and look over at car crashes, elicited me to watch. <br/><br/>Being bisexual, despite popular belief, does not mean one has two partners. I know, all of you in your corporate offices are probably shocked right now, thinking 'well, a bicycle has two wheels, doesn't that mean a bisexual has two partners?!' No, as a matter of fact, it doesn't. And as a bisexual in a loving manogamous relationship, I'm really starting to get p***ed off here.

","There were some very funny moments in this movie - but it was ultimately a one-trick pony. The fact that everyone is taking dodgeball so seriously is THE joke of the movie, and it wears thin. I also don't like the blatantly socialist message of this movie. The good guys are the ones who have a crappy gym, and who don't even charge their members to use the gym. The bad guys are the ones from Ben Stiller's gym. Stiller's character says that he built his gym from the ground up - starting from nothing. He built a successful gym with nice facilities. So what is so bad about that, and why does that make him the bad guy? I laughed out loud several times, but I could not ignore the overriding socialist sentiment that pollutes this movie."

","I was actually amazed by this film. Going into the theater, my expectations were on an all time low, yet somehow the intellectual challenge that is ""Dodgeball the Movie"" still manages to disappoint.<br/><br/>With movies of this genre, you expect bad acting, a barrage of cliches and stereotypes, and a lot of cheap slapstick humor. And that's OK. But nothing can adequately prepare you for the headache inducing performance  of Ben Stiller. Even to his own rock bottom standards, his acting (if we're going to use that word) is truly dismal. In fact, all the bad things about this type of film, the cliches, the predictability, it all seems to be just a bit worse in this 13-a-dozen Hollywood celluloid disposal.<br/><br/>But of course the real test is this: Is it fun, does this movie entertain you? Sadly, the answer is no. The total amount of beer you would have to drink in order to make this movie enjoyable would kill all but the most experienced alcoholics. The characters just aren't funny, and most of the jokes are too simple, too predictable and too badly timed to work. Sure there's a couple of good laughs here and there, but don't hold your breath.<br/><br/>If you are contemplating seeing this film, then here's my advise to you: don't. Use the money to buy ""There's something about Mary"", ""American Pie"" or ""Hey dude, where's my car"" on DVD and invite a couple of friends over. The movie will be better and the beer will be cheaper."

","Faced with losing his gym to a corporate chain, Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) enters his ragtag clientele in the Vegas Dodgeball Tournament. But Globo Gym's White Goodman (Stiller) is hip to their plan, entering his Purple Cobras to stop them.
Dodgeball's subtitle - 'A True Underdog Story' - couldn't be more apt. When the film first appeared, it was a true underdog indeed, written off as a lesser offering from Ben Stiller's Frat Pack. Once it hit, though, it was clear that this was arguably the most quotable - and funniest - dumb comedy since The Naked Gun.<br/><br/>On release, all the plaudits went to Stiller's preening villain White Goodman, but this is, in truth, an ensemble movie, with the likes of Rip Torn's foul-mouthed Patches O'Houlihan ably supporting him. The movie's secret weapon, though, is Vince Vaughn's sardonic protagonist Peter LaFleur, who keeps the craziness grounded in a manner reminiscent of a young Bill Murray.<br/><br/>So many ideas and gags crash into each other that some are bound to miss, and there are one or two patchy spells, but it's in the melding of styles that Dodgeball works, as director Rawson Marshall Thurber blends character-based comedy with gross-out and an excellent deployment of cameos (Norris! Shatner! Hasselhoff!). Most of all, it's a tribute to the joys of physical comedy - watching people being hit in the balls has never been so much fun.<br/><br/>Snappy, shameless and silly, it never once drops the ball.

But Stiller is very funny in DODGEBALL, along with everyone else. I wish there had been more Stephen Root and Rip Torn. I also loved Hank Azaria's spoof of old educational films on the history of Dodgeball. After OLD SCHOOL and this movie, Vince Vaughn is becoming the Bill Murray of his generation. Most of this movie is predictable and derivative but it keeps the laughs coming. Funny, funny stuff. Check it out."

","When I first saw the movie Dodgeball I thought that the story was starting out kind of slow and that the dialog was kind of corny in the earlier scenes. But once the movie picked up and began to turn the story into what it was I began to laugh consistently throughout the entire movie. This movie really is a reliable movie that will keep the laughs flowing throughout the 90 minutes. Ben Stiller performs in a very hilarious form as the fitness powered mega gym owner White Goodman. I really recommend that anybody that is a fan of Ben Stiller and his goofy antics at times, then go rent or somehow see this now. You will not be let down."

","I think this movie is great. Very funny from start to finish, and just goes on and on with the farce humour. There were a few things that I felt went a bit to far. I mean, it was just too gross for me. Like the masturbating with a pizza. I mean, come on! Was that really necessary?<br/><br/>One thing that really really bugs me, is the so called ""alternative ending"" Where globo gym wins, and not ""Average Joes."" They wanted to do it that was because they wanted to tell us that you can try in life, but you don't always win.<br/><br/>OK, here's the problem with that. We know already! We don't need multimillionaire Hollywood celebrates telling us average Joe's and Josephine's that! We freaken know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So mister director guy, who had a problem making an ending that didn't depress us, nor one that pointed out the obvious that the average person doesn't always win, go make an independent movie or something to make a more ""artistic"" or ""depressing"" or ""meaningful"" movie. Hey you would have less of a budget, and make less money, but that's not what's important right? <br/><br/>Plus, the movie ends tightly. Brings in all lose ends. If you see it, you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>And, on top of which, the ending brought in Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris! He's freaken awesome! See the movie! The whole one!

When one of his friends looks in the article in the magazine. He sees that they could save the gym, if they enter in the ""Dodgeball"" tournament at Las Vegas and a chance to win the grand prize. Which it's enough money to save the gym. But Goodman hears that La Fleur is in the tournament, he thinks he could beat La Fleur and his team. But La Fleur and his friends are not really good at this sport. One day, an old ""Dodgeball"" player Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) thinks he could help La Fleur's team to get in shape.

But this movie plays it much more realistic and players to get to play more than the three lead players in ""BASEketball"". Which, of course both movies have different sports. Perphas the problem with the picture, it's the script. Which the humour at times never hits the bull's eye. But it has enough funny moments to be viewed as a fairly good entertainment comedy flick.

"saarvardi","10","1","2","10 July 2007"," Sets an extremely high bar for future nonsense comedies
","""Nobody makes me bleed my own blood. NOBODY"", White Goodman (Ben Stiller) in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.<br/><br/>This ridiculous quote (don't bother searching for inner logic within it, you won't find any) is taken from one of the most zany, crude and remarkably dumb movies that were made for the silver screen in recent years. Guess what? The formula, absurd as it is, actually works. With the right cast, inexplicable cameos (Chuck Norris, Lans Armstrong and William Shatner all in one), and just the right amount of grown-up actors who are willing to embarrass themselves at any cost  Dodgeball is the best sports comedy made in the 2000's (miles better than Will Ferrell's overrated Talladega Nights).<br/><br/>Dodgeball tells the ludicrous story of a bunch of losers (A high school student with aspirations of becoming a male cheerleader, a man who thinks he's a pirate, a spineless nerd married to a male-ordered Asian wife and more) who work out together in a gym conveniently named ""Average Joes"". The manager of the gym is Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn, in his last pre-Wedding Crashers days), who has an ongoing dispute with one White Goodman (Stiller), the owner of a mega-successful chain of gyms who looks to take over La Fleur's gym as well. La Fleur, who is also in deep financial debts, has to come up with 50 grand as soon as possible, in order to prevent Goodman from executing his devilish scheme. When he and his brethren of losers learn about an obscure Dodgeball competition with a 50,000$ award tag attached, they must learn to play the game fast, and overcome Goodman's competing team in the finals.<br/><br/>The movie is very short, and very accelerating (I knew nothing about Dodgeball upon my first view, but hooked up with the rules of the game as the film went along), and pumps you up towards its adrenaline packed finale. The main course, however, is Ben Stiller's character, Goodman. Stiller gives out his best performance to date by portraying Goodman as the dumbest bad guy you'll ever see. The narcissistic head of the competitive chain of gyms is a goofy character, who speaks illogical sentences, often contradicting himself; greases himself up and masturbates with a Pizza slice (don't ask me how this works). Stiller gives Goodman the most outrageous gestures and one-liners I've seen in a while, especially when confronting Vaughn's character on screen; and comes out as a complete arrogant jerk. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor, is the bisexual bank accountant who comes to La Fleur's aid and eventually falls for him (more or less). Taylor and Vaughn's chemistry with Stiller is a definite advantage that helps carry the movie throughout its comedic sequences, setting an extremely high bar for future nonsense comedies.<br/><br/>If you love sports and comedies, and you don't get offended easily, Dodgeball is the place to be for relaxation and guilty pleasures."

""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball"" while he throws wrenches at the team.<br/><br/>Yes the movie is dumb and mainly slapstick humor but it is slapstick humor that is actually funny!

"Verix-1","9","1","2","8 November 2006"," A superbly simple comedy which delivers laugh after laugh
","As far as slapstick comedies go there are few which manage as many laughs as Dodgeball. The film sees Vaughn play a lovable gym owner who is both friendly and lax with his bill payments. The latter of these characteristics gets him in trouble with the bank and fellow gym owner Stiller threatens to buy out his gym if he doesn't find $50,000 by the end of the month. OK so the story up to now is a bit weak, well it doesn't really improve, but as Vaughn and his band of 'Average Joe's' decide to enter a dodge-ball competition to get the money the laughs come thick and fast. The group is later joined by Rip Tom, an eccentric ex-player who believes that ""if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball"" and star thrower Christine Taylor. Many of the laughs maybe juvenile and slapstick but there something about a guy getting hit in the crotch with a wrench that never stops being funny.What's more every member of the cast seems to fit into there roles perfectly from Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk) to the 'out of it' commentator Pepper Brooks (Jason Bateman). In fairness the film won't appeal to everyone, it's got a simple story line with uncomplicated gags and it's fronted by Vaughen and Stiller who's names in a film nowadays promise one of 'those' sort of comedies.<br/><br/>But for me the film is laugh out loud funny with superb characters.<br/><br/>I'd recommend anyone who enjoyed Acchorman or The 40 Year Old Virgin to take a look."
"t1n02112","7","1","2","18 September 2006"," Pure, over the the top Stiller humor. Think of it as Jock-lander.
","If you like Stiller, you'll love this. I've seen this several times on cable, and I'll watch it again if it is on. (I watch TV in the background while I work at my computer) To me it falls into the category of movies that you can watch piecemeal, pick it up anywhere and just enjoy it scene by scene. It's funny stuff. I don't understand how people try to compare this type of movie to a major drama, or mega action movie. This movie is neither, and those who judge this by those standards are probably the same people that drive a huge SUV by themselves everyday to work, or try to move a mattress by strapping it to the roof of a little compact car. This movie is a cheesy frat humor flic, and hits that target perfectly. By the way, it only cost 30 mil to make, but pulled in four times as much at the box office. That is a good return on investment. Yes, it may seem like an SNL skit, but a really good one, with very good execution, and perfect editing. It's got a good pace to it, and there's little sub-references here and there to keep it interesting. For example, there's a banner that says ""Go Balls Deep"" over the playing court. Another one is ""Deus ex Machina"", which is a reference to ancient dramas where something sweeps in and saves the day. In this movie it's a treasure chest full of cash. And of course, William Shatner as a game judge, doing a little 'Kirk' voice style in the locker room. And a cameo by Lance Armstrong giving Vince Vaughn the required ""You can do it"" speech, except instead, he give him a sarcastic 'I sure you won't regret this for the rest of your life"" line. =================Minor Spoiler Below======================<br/><br/>The characters are well cast, and the do the best with what they've got. It goes without saying, that there is a showdown, and the underdog saves the day, get the girls, and the bad guy is sent packing. (That's never happened before...I can't believe I just labeled that as a spoiler)<br/><br/>I liked this movie, I laughed many times, I still laugh when I see it, or remember certain scenes.<br/><br/>This is the a 'Zoolander' for Jocks.

I'm still laughing!!!<br/><br/>I also found something interesting during my visit to the Special Features. The first thing that you notice is that the layout of the section is Average Joes and the little scene off to the side is Justin's ever-hilarious attempt to catch Patches's dodge balls during training. However, look next to the balloon that says ""resume film"". You see a balloon that is Globo Gym's logo. Click it, and you are taken to a scene where the fat White Goodman says that every time he snaps his fingers in the movie, hit enter. It happens three times in the movie. 1. When White tries to seduce Kate in his office, 2. At the Dirty Sanchez, after White pushed the waitress onto the Average Joes's table, and lastly, 3. After Kate throws White against her door and he says ""nobody makes me bleed in my own blood. Nobody!"" After you press enter for the third time, you will be taken to the scene where White does his ""Patented 'Peek-a-Boo'"" dodge ball throw, then to the t.v in the Globo Gym building (the one where he says ""There's a good energy in the gym"". You, for quite some time, watch the little show on the screen before you are taken back to the scene where White gets on the Blue motor scooter driven by Me'Shell. The show is funny. I found that you have to press enter right when he snaps his fingers. It's kind of hard to get it right, but it does work."

I have friends that say this was the dumbest movie ever, and i can't completely disagree with them. The humor is VERY low-brow, but also fairly creative (Anouncer saying that the dodgeball dancers were good, clean, family fun). And low-brow happens to be very funny.

One is run by a bunch of misfits and has serious financial difficulties. The other is a multi million outfit run by Stiller and his cronies. As the poor gym desperately trys to earn money the mega gym attempts to thwart it in every way until the poor gym come across the game of dodgeball. A championship is to be held this year and if the gym win they will have enough to continue their business. However the mega gym also enters in an attempt to put an end to their business once and for all. The cast are all awesome. Vince Vaughn is the likable hero and in Justin Long pain has never been so funny. Ben Stiller as I mentioned above is the star performance however and in many respects the man carries the movie. The film has good pacing even if certain comical scenes and jokes are stretched at times, plus the Dodgeball sequences themselves are very entertaining. The jokes do come thick and fast and 90% of them work perfectly. The other 10% do stick out a bit though. Some of these jokes also suffer from to much bad taste , such as the pizza down the pants sequence. All in all Dogeball is a great film for laughs and is certainly the funniest film 2004 offered us."

","First of all, hats off to Ben Stiller. This guy is why I watch movies that look stupid. You just never know what he is going to do next. The funny thing about this movie is that after I saw this I started digging around the TV channels to find out there is a real Dodgeball Tournament. To me I found that great. In high school thats all we played was dodge-ball. So when I started watching the movie I got into it even more. My Favorite Part in this move is when Ben Stiller jumps onto the back of Jamal Duff's little scooter and flips off Christine Taylor. And a strange out of left field thing was Steve the Pirate. I can't remember ever seeing a pirate play dodge-ball. If you are looking for an action packed movie I do not suggest this movie for you. If your looking to laugh hard than buy this movie. I've seen this movie 15 times now {It's on HBO a lot} and I'll keep doing so till I get bored with it."
"chucklesgreenwald","10","1","2","8 March 2006"," Big Ups to Ben Stiller.. Who put his career on the line and saved a movie by acting perfectly as a great idiot!
","Dodgeball was one of my favorite movies. You know why it was? It was because I love my Ben Stiller in free-range mode, ready to do anything at any given time. Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, and Rip Torn were also very good. With backup roles like Hank Azaria, Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as co-hosts for the Dodgeball tournament, and Lance Armstrong making an appearance to inspire a character in the movie, you can't go wrong. The slapstick in this comedy is uproarious, completely showing all of the talents young actors and veterans can display with improvisational talent. The Dodgeball quarrell between Average Joe's and the Purple Cobras is a great scene because it really shows how Ben Stiller was the absolute perfect role as White Goodman. Ben has that charm that allows him to act perfectly arrogant, conceided disdainful as his character. He has that condescending look to him that gives movie viewers the note that he is the bad guy in the movie, without a doubt.<br/><br/>Overall ""Dodgeball, A True Underdog Story"" is a great movie for anyone who is ready to laugh at a truly remarkable performance, alongside other brilliant but subtle performances. Dodgeball will make you laugh, cry, and pee in your pants every delirious step of the way."

","Ben Stiller's best roles have been the few that have almost burst his carotid artery through certifiably asinine overacting. (To date, that would only count *Mystery Men*, *Zoolander*, and cameos in *Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy* and *The Cable Guy* - add *Dodgeball* to that short list.) His early 90s comedy series, *The Ben Stiller Show*, though a fine showcase for his frenetic talents, was so underrated and misunderstood that it was actually cancelled first time outa the gate, only to be reinstated on Comedy Central at varying intervals. Unfortunately, in his gradual assimilation into feature film pap, his chunky monkey breadwinner is his Woody Allen Lite nebbish (*Your Friends and Neighbors, Along Came Polly, Meet The Parents, et al*; hell! - he even turned David Starsky into a neb!).<br/><br/>*Dodgeball* is Stiller's welcome return to artery-busting form, as the corporate gym owner, White Goodman - entrepreneurial, avaricious, bombastic Bad Guy to Vince Vaughn's somnolent Pete La Fleur, who mismanages his own failing gym across the way. White has designs on merging Pete's fringe-dweller gym with his own commercial monster conglomerate and will go to any sweat-tainted lengths to corporately consume it.<br/><br/>In this film fantasy where an independent, successful, sexy woman (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real-life wife, playing Kate the auditor, whom everybody wants to examine ""under the counter""), can fall for a shiftless itinerant like Pete La Fleur, it is no stretch to discover that the only way La Fleur can raise money to save his gym is to enter a Dodgeball tournament with a cadre of his willing (though untrained) gym patrons. Due to the movie taking itself about as seriously as the inflated bulge in White Goodman's jockstrap, we go along for the ride.<br/><br/>Hank Azaria and Rip Torn camp it up as young and old versions of legendary Dodgeballer, Patches O'Houlihan, whose methods of training La Fleur's dysfunctional, ubergeek squad would give any man pause for scrotal reflection.<br/><br/>The tournament itself action-packs the last half hour of film, and climaxes with Pete and White facing off (- how'd you guess? You must be psychic!). During the game-play, director and writer, Rawson Marshall Thurber cannily transfers the volley of humor, which rested upon the main cast  who has now taken to the Dodgeball court  to the broadcast commentators, Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (Gary Cole and Jason Bateman, hamming their roles with a vengeance and a copy of the Insensate Drivel Handbook).<br/><br/>Any movie artful enough to tweak audiences into investing their alliance in a misfit dodgeball team has more going for it than just hot chicks and scrotum jokes. Who outside of the sixth grade even knew this sport still existed in mankind's repertoire? Anxiety churns my blood, for the internet can so easily resolve this mystery, yet I dare not make the connection, for I fear I will either discover a horror so demeaning that it will debase my already staggering lack of faith in humanity's intelligence quotient, or  L. Ron Hubbard have mercy! - I may suddenly embrace the urge to squoze my scrote into a purple unitard and take one on the face for the team  and if that image doesn't get your carotid artery throbbing, it's already burst<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

","Sometimes, a dumb, funny movie just totally hits the spot. And that's the case with this movie. Dodgeball is freakin' funny, but don't expect Noel Coward. To me, the funniest bit is watching Justin Long taking a wrench to the face, so that should tell you the kind of movie this is.<br/><br/>But you have to be clever when you make a dumb movie, and this movie is full of cleverness. Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as the sports announcers were amazing; I never knew Gary Cole was so funny. And Justin Long has a real future doing physical comedy. As they say in the commentary, he is ""a study in ham and cheese."" MAN he's funny.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is awesome as White Goodman, the cartoonish bad guy. Some of his best humor comes from his screen time shared with Jamal Duff, who plays ""Me'Shell,"" White's 'fitness concigliere.' And Vince Vaughn sort of plays a standard Vince Vaughn role, but he's still great. <br/><br/>Stephen Root adds another classic character role to his impressive repertoire. And Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate totally rocks! When I heard that he was in this movie playing a guy who thinks that he's a pirate, I thought, ""WOW, this movie must be stupid."" You have to see it to get it. <br/><br/>If you don't mind broad physical comedy and references to obscure, gross sex acts, then this movie is great for a laugh."

","I saw this movie at the cinema, and thought it was hilarious. Being a film reviewer, I got free admission, but would have gladly paid the full fare with the advantage of hindsight. This movie was nonstop fun. Stiller is at his usual brilliant best, and Vaughn plays the laid back gym owner to perfection. Chuck Norris plays a small yet decisive cameo role. I cannot possibly fault this movie, other than to say the pirate character could have been better. A great comedy when you are not in the mood for concentrating to hard. Easy to watch, and completely enjoyable.<br/><br/>Stiller plays the stereotypical American health freak brilliantly, and Rip Torn is ever so funny as the ex-champion dodgeballer, Patches Ohoolighan. It is amazing that it is still funny to see a grown man fall to his knees after being barraded by numerous balls. Torn's techniques as coach are tremendous. He says at one point ""If you can dodge a wrench,you can dodge a ball!"" And then goes on to hurl large amounts of various tools at an innocent team member. Classic comedy at its finest.MAssive. Big up."

","Ben Stiller manages to take silly humor and keep it funny. Playing a stereotypical ""bad guy"" with just a little bit of inadequacy coming in. Sure he's in shape now, but inside he's still the same fat guy. But Stiller keeps it fresh instead of cliché', or maybe he just makes the cliché' hilarious. The rest of the cast very good, it takes a while to figure out, where do I know ? them from. The storyline is there to showcase the humor, Vince Vaughan is the ""no goal"" (easier to attain that way) good guy. With his wacky crew of misfits, Alan Tudyk shines as the pirate. And every time Jason Bateman's Pepper opened his mouth, I was laughing. David Hasselhoff and William Shatner have very tongue in cheek cameos. And Chuck Norris was funny without saying a word. Best viewed with a group of friends with a twisted sense of humor!"
"Okonh0wp","8","1","2","25 June 2005"," Riveting and Sharp Comedy
","Dodgeball is a riveting and sharp comedy about a sport we all stopped taking seriously after our last elementary school gym class.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn plays Peter LaFluer, owner of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. His membership total consists of just five, but nevertheless, the personable LaFluer is happy to be of service to his clients, even if they are all pathetically out of shape and a little off the norm. His gym is in financial trouble, however, and LaFluer is notified at the start of the film that he has thirty days to pay off its loan or it will be shut down. LaFluer's gym will be bought out by Globo, owned by the villainous White Goodman. Stiller pulls out the stops as Goodman, taking every opportunity to make himself dislike-able so that his demise at the film's end will be all the more sweeter.<br/><br/>In need of a desperate solution, LaFluer and his clients sit down in his office and brainstorm. The solution comes from Gordon (Root) who reads in his magazine Obscure Sports Quarterly about an upcoming dodgeball tournament in which they could win the required money, so the ragtag bunch sets out to learn the sport and win the tournament. Their biggest obstacle is that in order to ensure Average Joe's shutdown, Goodman fields a team of bodybuilders to win the tournament and deny LaFluer the money, setting the stage for a David vs Goliath match up in the upcoming tournament.<br/><br/>If there's one thing, aside from the satire, that there is to love about this movie, it's the quirky group of guys who comprise LaFluer's team. With the exception of Dwight (Williams), whose quirkiest attribute is his hatred of his previous job at the airport, the group is a very creative assemblage of underdogs. Vaughn plays the straight man, next to Stiller, his own team, and pretty much everyone else in the movie. You'd think that the love interest Christine Taylor as the lawyer, initially hired by Goodman to shut down Average Joe's but ends up joining the team out of disgust for the villain, but she turns out to have her own weird attributes.<br/><br/>In a sense, Dodgeball is sort of a quasi-sports film because it centers around a sport that doesn't actually exist in terms of a spectator base, and uses that to poke fun at some of the sillier aspects of our present-day athletic culture. Be warned, this film is merciless, attacking everything from bodybuilders to ESPN to team uniforms. I particularly found it hilarious that the tournament was broadcast on ESPN 8, which probably is only a couple years away at this rate, and that one of the sports commentators (Arrested Development's Jason Bateman) knew absolutely nothing of what he was talking about.<br/><br/>The movie gets caught up in all the satire, however, and towards the end drifts off into an absurd ending that really left a bad taste in my mouth. The ending threw so much of reality out the window, that it felt like a Mel Brooks film, which is a shame because up until the last couple minutes, the film did a terrific job at cracking out hilarious jokes within the context of a story. Looking back, though, the first couple of hours more than make up for the last couple of minutes, and I would have rather the movie aimed high and missed a couple notes, rather than being safe and not being as funny."
"meeza","10","1","2","24 June 2005"," A Ballistic Classic!
","It took some balls to develop a film based on the sport of Dodgeball! How can a movie based on an endangered sport entice moviegoers? Well, the formula worked! ""Dodgeball: The True Underdog Story"" was a box office underdog hit! The film was hilarious! Vince Vaughn stars as Peter LeFleur, an Average Joe gym owner who is struggling to keep his what-else but ""Average Joe"" gym open for business. Moreover, ""Average Joe's"" reality show comes into play when White Goodwin, the competitive successful owner of Globo's Gym, threatens to buy out the Average Joe Gym for it to be utilized as a parking garage for Globos. Peter LeFleur must come up with $50k in less than a month to avoid the buyout. For Pete's sake, Why do ""Average Joels"" I mean ""Average Joes"" finish last! Ben Stiller as White Godwin was an undeniable laugh riot! His White Lies make him out to be a womanizing entrepreneur when in fact he is a self-absorbed insecure rat. However, his self-absorption creates a comical fixation to us viewers for the Globo master who's bubble has burst! Stiller continues to instill laughter in movies with the best of them. Back to Peter! In order to come up with the $50k cashola, Peter and his Average Joe entourage gym members decide to enter a Dodgeball contest in Las Vegas. The problem is that the only thing these guys have ever dodged in their lives are punches from the bullies who have harassed them their entire lives. Justin Long, Stephen Root, Joel Moore, Chris Williams, and Vaughn himself executed better than average performances as the Average Joes! Rip Torn was also mesmerizing as Patches O' Houlihan, an old-timer Dodgeball legend who coaches the Joes. Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife, was watching as Kate Veatch; the lawyer representing Goodwin who decides to become an Average Joe dodgeballer herself. ""Dodgeball: The True Underdog Story"" is the funniest film I saw in 2004! Hats off to Writer-Director Rawson Marshall Thurber! His marshall comedic plan was filled with raw laughs! It's a doggoned or should I say underdog classic! ***** EXCELLENT"
"mdfuk","8","1","2","8 June 2005"," Ben Stiller steals the show, cuts loose and shows what a great comedy actor he is
","Ben Stiller has made a successful film career from being a great comedy character actor. With films like ""Zoolander"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"" Stiller has formed memorably hilarious characters people will still be quoting in years to come. His character in Dodgeball is no different but not only does Stiller steal the limelight of this picture but in my opinion pulls off one of, if not the best comic performance of his career Stiller plays ""White Goodman"" an egotistical fitness maniac bent on domination of the complete health market. He is determined to destroy another local gym Average Joes by what ever means he can, and when he hears the Average Joe staff are entering a dodge-ball tournament to pay off their increasing debts Goodman cannot refuse heating up the competition by signing his own team up in direct competition. Goodman is portrayed as the pinnacle of self improvement in both gaining the ""perfect body"" from being a seriously obese man and acquiring a fortune from his self build corporation Globo-gym. Stiller makes this character so over the top in his appearance from sporting a supremely blow-dried mullet and Fu Manchu moustache to wearing garish leather outfits not seen since the late 70's. What makes Goodman such a superb parody of all fitness gurus everywhere is Stiller's never failing ability to bring embarrassing laughs and cringes from the audience and make a complete fool of himself at the same time. In one memorable scene in this film he tries to ""woo"" bank officer Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) by pumping up his crutch with an air pump and delivering supposedly witty lines (including some very bad punning on the word shackles) that was so cringe worthy and embarrassing it almost made me turn from watching it. I'm glad I didn't because every line Stiller delivers is perfectly timed and executed for its full comic value. Dodgeball without Stiller would have scored a very low mark on my rating as to be brutally honest as much as I love this film the story line is extremely corny. The Average Joes gym has serious debts and needs to pay them off before they lose the land the gym is built on. It so happens there is a Dodgeball tournament that will pay the winner the exact amount of money they needed to raise to save the gym. Of course with the addition of the Globo-gym team it was obvious from the start who was going to win the tournament and who the final would be contested between this predictability made the film seriously slow down in pace in the final third which is a little disappointing. The only thing else to really stand out from this film was the character of Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn a wheelchair bound ex-dodge-ball all star who coaches the Average Joe's team with such methods and advice as ""if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball"" and ""your playing like a bunch of retards trying to hump a door knob"". However all said about the cheesy storyline, if you want a film where Ben Stiller steals the show, cuts loose and shows what a great comedy actor he is Dodgeball is definitely for you."

"MovieAddict2016","8","1","2","9 May 2005"," A good silly movie that is everything ""Anchorman"" should have been.
","When I heard of ""Anchorman,"" I thought the premise was inspired, and with its cast I was sure it would be a great stupid, silly comedy. Unfortunately it turned out to be a major disappointment and the companion piece of the year -- ""Dodgeball"" (another hopelessly silly comedy) -- turned out to be the better of the two and brought in some $30 million on opening weekend; quite a feat for a film featuring an actor accused of starring in too many films (Ben Stiller) and an actor whose career has been reduced to shambles recently (Vince Vaughn).<br/><br/>""Dodgeball"" is by no means a great comedy or an important piece of work but it doesn't have any pretensions to be. It follows in the path of slacker underdog movies like ""Animal House"" and just about any sports movie you can think of but it doesn't try to be anything more than what it is: an entertaining piece of trash. This is not out to win an Oscar, its purpose is to make us laugh and I did so quite a bit.<br/><br/>Vaughn is perfectly cast as an average Joe who owns a gym called Average Joes (ah, irony). Stiller is the owner of the competing ""Globo-Gym,"" a super-slick company with a $4 million price tag and an interesting company slogan: ""We're better than you, and we know it!"" When Peter (Vaughn) fails to pay off debts his gym faces foreclosure and he must raise fifty thousand dollars or else Stiller will buy his land and turn it into a huge parking lot for Globo-Gym.<br/><br/>So in order to raise the cash Peter and his die-hard gym members (a pack of idiots, losers and a wannabe-pirate [?]) compete in the American Dodgeball Association of America (I didn't get the joke the first time I heard it!) against Globo-Gym's Purple Cobras team.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller's been getting on my nerves a bit lately, wearing his put-upon-nice-guy shtick into the ground. He's reached a point -- along with Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell and Luke Wilson -- where they all just goof off in their movies, performing cameos or appearing in starring roles, and at first it's pretty amusing but after a while the whole Troup Stiller/Wilson routine gets old... ""Anchorman"" had Ferrell, Wilson, Stiller and Vaughn, and ""Starsky and Hutch"" had the other Wilson, Stiller, Vaughn, Ferrell etc... not to mention the fact that Duplex, Meet the Fockers and Along Came Polly all featured performances by Stiller that were eerily similar.<br/><br/>Anyway suffice to say Stiller gives his best 2004 performance in ""Dodgeball,"" creating an over-the-top character who's very similar to the obsessive weight loss instructor in one of his earliest comedies, ""Heavy Weights,"" which might be a sequel of sorts to this since ""Dodgeball"" supposedly takes place in 1993 and that movie took place in 1994...<br/><br/>Overall ""Dodgeball"" is just good silly fun. Stiller is doing another one of his usual routines but he's a great deal funnier than he has been in many other films last year, and I like him better as the angry freak rather than the put-upon shmuck, which he's simply done way too much lately.<br/><br/>The movie delivers laughs and doesn't attempt to do anything else... I'm not making this out to be a great movie because it's not. It's the sort of popcorn flick I'd watch if it came on TV in the future -- worth a rental at least."

","There is something funny about stupid films. Just look at the Montey Python series. This film is stupid. This film is daft But it is very funny. White Goodman. What a legend. Ben Stiller created the perfect 'villian' in this. Villain i suppose is a strong word, as you end up falling for his stupid comments, and actually feel a little bit sorry for him at the end. Vince Vaughn is good as Peter La Fleur. However, towards the end, i actually prefer White Goodman. If 'Le Loser' didn't have a bunch of great and very lovable characters on his side, then id have been rooting on Stiller. Justin Long is great. The flashback to his cheer leading audition is one of the funniest things i have seen for a long time. However, the best part is the dodge balling itself. Half of this film is the tournament itself. And boy is it great. Patches O'Houlihan has the best lines in this section, and until his demise, was becoming as good as Goodman. A favourite quote being 'Your about as useful as a cock flavoured lollipop'. Great stuff. People talk about this film as being predictive and obvious. But who cares. Its not called 'a true underdogs story' for nothing, and no matter how many times i see a Dodgeball hitting someone, i still let out a little giggle. This film is a dig at other films like 'Mighty Ducks'. but this is funny. This is the funniest 'sports' film ever. Bring on Dodgeball 2, or a film about Beachballing"

I'm not a big fan of stupid comedies, but this one had me laughing. Ben Stiller is a riot in a part he has done before, the egotistical exercise maniac who is unbelievably full of himself. Vince Vaughn is wonderfully deadpan as the owner of the run-down gym that needs saving. Christine Taylor is good as the banker who is the unwilling object of Stiller's affection; her scenes of disgust when acting opposite him are hilarious. But, the highlight comes when Justin Long's character is subjected to dodgeball torture by Rip Torn's oddball trainer. It's all hilarious from beginning to end."

","Out of all the whacky, out of the ordinary sports movies that I've ever seen, Dodgeball is definitely one in the taking.<br/><br/>It's just too stupid, yet delightfully humorous for some parts, and really gets in detail. The film has very good programming, and also shows glimpses maybe of a secondcoming? Maybe.<br/><br/>Good reasons why to see this film. Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor are brilliant together, Vince Vaughn really gave a solid performance, the suspense is great, and also some of the effects they used are pretty good.<br/><br/>Good reasons why NOT to see this film. Rip Torn looks like a complete moron as the as Coach Patches, the ending is very predictable, and also, Some parts are just well overdone, taking the beginning for example, it takes a good 5 minutes just to get his point across already!

Thurber, Vaughan, Stiller and all the rest of the outstanding team deserve lots of credit. The overall story is well presented, and the dialog sparkles. There are plenty of raunchy innuendos--and some not so innuendo! I viewed this movie also as a satire on big- money big-time sports in America and the do-or-die attitude of many of its stars who often play with injuries and in great pain in order to satisfy terms of their contracts with wealthy team owners.This all seems to be neatly summed up at the very end of the movie with Pete LeFleur's surprise--not to be revealed here."

","OK, I've never been one for films that deal with sports but this film has really changed my view on how super they can be. I think one of the best things in this film is the comedy value, not only does it mix comedy with seriousness of the film but it also has symbolism of ""Anything is possible, even if the odds are against you"" and I think films that symbolise things of great importance to us really convey a spectacular performance. The whole cast was very well chosen and Ben Stiller really takes his part well when he becomes what he used to become at the end, a lazy slob.<br/><br/>Anyway, the title may seem boring but the film is exquisite, it's a film that might not spark your interest into watching it but you will succumb to the temptation of watching it for the first time or again as there is always something that you want answered or if you just want to listen to a particular line. This is one of those films that you must see, granted, that can be said for a lot of films though this really is a film you have to see to be able to come to a judgement."

","Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is not groundbreaking by any means... in fact it was quite disappointing, not enough fun or risqué stuff to really bother watching it for and it doesn't help that doorbell is about as exciting to watch as three legged tortoise. The film seemed very, very short, probably because nothing really happened apart from the obvious, doorbell practise, then doorbell tournament, bit of rivalry, etc... absolutely nothing new or even close to any originality. Ben Stiller is quite scary as the 'bad guy' a bit too far fetched, but i suppose it is in the essence of the movie. The only time I did laugh was with a scene near the end with Lance Armstrong... it is a classic moment in an otherwise poor film."

That is a good thing for this film.<br/><br/>Imaginatively enough titled 'Average Joe's' is a gym where the losers and underdogs hang out, apparently not working out though. It is shoddily run and trouble is brewing. Unless they can rustle up $ 50,000 in quick time 'Average Joe's' will lose their gym to the sleek corporate style efficiency of 'globo gym' (Motto: We are better than you and we know it).<br/><br/>But AJ regulars-a weanie, a kook who thinks that he is a pirate, a bespectacled middle aged loser and a dumb brick- love the place enough to do anything to prevent this from happening. Their only hope however, is to win the a dodgeball championship in Vegas which coincidentally offers the exact amount required as a prize to the winning team. They manage to coax the good-hearted hero and owner Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) into being a part of the wild scheme. A crazy coach, Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) with innovative methods like bunging wrenches at the team, the mandatory female-potential-love-interest for-hero and an adrenalin charged tournament in showy Vegas complete the picture. <br/><br/>The spoofs on American fondness for obscure are funny enough. But, you can see it all coming. Like when weanie boy gets new uniforms for the team, you know that something other than the ordered uniforms is going to come out of that box. You can be equally sure that some act of providence will let the team win the mandatory 'regional qualifiers' on some technicality. In reality they have lost out to a team of girl scouts. <br/><br/>Ben Stiller is White Goodman the smarmy fitness freak that runs Globo and is out to get the underdog. His character gives him ample potential to create some gross humour that either makes people laugh or wince. To the audience that belongs to the former category this film will work well enough.

Such cross-cultural differences are unavoidable, and were illustrated recently in the London newspapers' reviews of the wonderful ""Shrek 2,"" for example. But they all will nonetheless have a great time.<br/><br/>Will Brits know that dodgeball is a common children's game, and its quasi-violent theme makes it somewhat of a rite of passage in many American's memories of primary school? Dunno... but they should be told that dodgeball, portrayed as a ""sport"" in this movie is a total gag, joke, folly, etc. Reminding us of the male modeling world in the under-rated ""Zoolander."" It makes a wonderfully sardonic backdrop for the sheer silliness and deep humor of Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and the ever-great and immensely talented Rip Torn.<br/><br/>This isn't a masterpiece, and may not even be ""great,"" per se, but it is very good, and well worth making the trip out to see.

"Pavel-8","4","1","2","21 June 2004"," The degeneration of Ben Stiller continues.
","**Warning! Minor Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>Imagine you're a world famous chef (Bear with me, this is going somewhere...honest.) preparing a pasta dish for a big competition. You've rounded up the best possible ingredients, and whipped up a picture perfect meal. The homemade pasta is perfect; the chicken appears to be seasoned ideally; and the cream sauce is to die for. It all looks great on the table, except for one thing: you unintentionally used sugar instead of salt in the marinade, literally leaving the judges with an unpleasant taste in their mouths. The sauce and pasta are still good, but the dissonant taste of the chicken ruins the entire dish. <br/><br/>That's ""Dodgeball"". The concept drips with comic potential: an underdog dodgeball team, led by Vince Vaughn, faces off against the Goliath of the sport, a squad captained by Ben Stiller (in his fourth and perhaps worst movie of 2004). That's a typical sports movie storyline, infused with Stiller's usually stellar humor. The cast, primarily Vaughn and Stiller, are top comedic actors who have proven their talents multiple times. But the flavoring provided by two-thirds of the script dooms the entire film to mediocrity at best. Maybe Stiller needs Owen Wilson back to write him a passable script. <br/><br/>The title and hilarious trailer present the premise of the movie, but don't warn of the sixty minutes of filler that surround the games themselves. The basic setup of competing gyms is funny, and once finally reached thirty minutes in, the dodgeball scenes are comic gold. It's dodgeball for crying out loud. Just typing that makes me laugh. Televised on ESPN8, The Ocho, the championship tournament and its ethnically diverse teams provide the movie's best laughs. But in the meantime the movie struggles in ways that many sports movies do, as pointless, often crass, story arcs futilely attempt to inject romance and purpose into the games. I realize that the movie has to be longer than half an hour, but the quality comedy of dodgeball deserves better than bad SNL support. <br/><br/>Stiller inadvertently explains the problem with his movie in the worst credits sequence I've ever seen. He mockingly complains that audiences are looking for mindless entertainment, ironically having just sated that very group of people. Instead of producing razor-sharp satire like ""Zoolander"", Stiller and his crew have degenerated into substandard crude comedy (and I use the term loosely) reminiscent of (gasp) ""BASEsketball"". The last ten minutes are a prime example. After the inevitable climax, not a single line or scene is necessary. It's nothing but crude and lazy fluff, stretching the running time to a palatable 90 minutes. <br/><br/>The cast and crew have proven they can produce good to great comedy without resorting to puerile tactics and endless joke repetition. Better is expected here, especially of Stiller, who also co-produced ""Dodgeball"". He has churned out comedic hits like ""Keeping the Faith"", ""Meet the Parents"", and ""Zoolander"", all of which were often roll-on-the-floor funny without waaaay over-the-top violence and innuendo. <br/><br/>On the minimal plus side, Stiller and Vaughn are still their usual solid selves, although most of the stale jokes seem to be recycled from their other work. Perhaps because Stiller seems to be working so hard to earn laughs, Vaughn shines as the straight man. Nothing he does is inherently humorous, in fact I don't think he even performed all that well, but within the context of such an overblown movie, his subdued everyman actions occasionally strike a comedic chord. Christine Taylor is again adequate, playing almost the same character she did in ""Zoolander"", a role that demands little. Rip Torn is the right man for his part as a crotchety old ex-dodgeball star, but his excessive crudeness and violence doesn't play right, although his departure from the movie does provide one of its funnier moments. As a standard assortment of misfits and musclemen, no one else does much of anything worth mentioning, except for a few strong cameo appearances that leave you wishing for more. <br/><br/>Technically, there's not much to say. Comedies such as this, even the good ones, are rarely notable (in a good or bad manner) for editing or score, and form holds here. The only noteworthy accomplishment is the horrific use of Chris De Burgh's classic ballad ""Lady in Red"". <br/><br/>The movie raised various unanswerable questions. What's the deal with the pirate? How many times am I supposed to laugh at a guy getting hit in the groin? Do the financial aspects at the end actually make sense? Why did I pay money to see this garbage? These queries are unanswerable because by the time the movie stumbles to a halt, your brain will be numb, and you won't care enough to try a logical response. <br/><br/>With the subtitle of ""A True Underdog Story"", perhaps ""Dodgeball"" was hoping to spawn a sequel. I hope that it does. Perhaps that one will find the missing two-thirds of this movie and live up to the potential promised by the premise and talent. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: Less than half of a great movie gets less than half of a great rating.  4 of 10, and that might be generous."

","So really, it IS funny to see someone get hit in the face with a dodgeball. Really. <br/><br/>Rawson Marshall Thurber (who?!) wrote and directed this little number with quite some flare, bringing Stiller to the screen as an annoying uber-gym owner, and Vaughn as the 'obviously going to win' underdog. It was refreshing to see a slapstick comedy without as many crude gags as is the norm nowadays, and although there were a few, it's kept to a minimum and I was grateful for this. I admit, I was expecting utter crap, but was pleasantly surprised. Much of the humour present here is a result of people getting hit with dodgeballs or wrenches (yes, wrenches) but since this is a movie, and therefore NOT real, it's OK to laugh (probably). This movie's heart is in the right place, and although I'm not saying this is the best movie I've ever seen (far, far, far, far, far from it), it IS enjoyable, light-hearted, amusing, and just downright fun.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Nearly all films are about other films, sometimes literally so.<br/><br/>An 'ordinary' mass film purports to abstract life by replaying stuff from the established vocabulary. I dare say there are thousands and thousands of sports films with this plot: apparent weaklings triumph which a key individual reaffirms some sort of purity. Last night I saw 'Barbershop 2' which though not strictly a sports movie, wears the metaphor like many blacks wear 'leisure' athletic clothes. <br/><br/>That's the ordinary. Then you have the kind of film that does precisely the same abstraction, except instead of purportedly from life, it is from the genre. Exact same everything, except the abstraction is that much more extreme.<br/><br/>Ted's law says that the two abstractions (from life to the ordinary film and from the ordinary film to the spoof) must be exactly the same. That's because ALL the cinematic mechanisms must be the same, else there is no joke.<br/><br/>I believe this style started in 1950's TeeVee skits, and probably 15 or 20 minutes is about as long as you can sustain the joke. To judge from the success of Austin Powers, some folks can take it longer. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","Basically, my thoughts about this movie can be summed up in the title of this review. A family member of mine got this movie as a gift last Christmas, and just recently I was in a ""comedy"" mood and gave it a viewing. By the end of the film, though, the only person I was laughing at was myself for sitting through the whole thing.<br/><br/>The problems with this film are numerous: The jokes rely way too much on crude humor, they often aren't even funny in that area, and the goal of the film (to combine comedy with an even somewhat compelling storyline) is not even close to realized. About the only positive impact this movie had on society was to get people playing the game of dodgeball once again. Yet, it was no thanks to the jokes in this movie...just the base subject matter.<br/><br/>Thus, if you are looking for 90 minutes of laughter, please look elsewhere. Only a couple of decently funny scenarios kept this movie away from a bottom-of-the-barrel one star rating, and a ""1.5 stars"" would have been the optimal rating. Fans of Ben Stiller will find Zoolander to offer more genuine laughs, while others may want to steer clear of this entire comedy genre altogether."

Yet, he wrote and directed this film -- flawlessly -- and cast some of the best actors in the business. Plenty of big names here, and some great character actors. How did he do that?<br/><br/>I have no idea. But what I do know is that this film is genuinely hilarious. The jokes are well-written, and well-delivered by the cast.

","I feel cheated and ashamed at the same time that this country produces such crap. It was like watching SNL sketch with all the actors thrown in into the pile and told to do one liners. White Goodman is the owner of this high tech and very profitable gym while Peter La Fleur is his nemesis across the street who owns Average Joe's gym, which is, of course, on the brinks of bankruptcy. When White wants to take over Average Joe's gym, Peter and his club members need to come up with $50,000 in 30 days to keep the gym alive. What starts out as a promising film turns into an outrageous display of violence and stupidity. My issue with the movie is with the improper cast of roles. Vince Vaughn (Peter La Fleur) and Ben Stiller (White Goodman) would have made a better movie had they been in opposite roles. WHY? Because Vince is more convincing as a bad guy while Ben has always played positive characters. Vince has this evil look in his eyes even when he tries to be a nice guy. Most of the characters looked cartoonish? Nobody acts like that in real life. And what is with this sport Dogdeball? The only goal is to throw balls at each other? A couple of years ago there was a movie called Rollerball which I recall was way more entertaining that this one. At least, in that film they didn't try to make it funny. I think this is where Dodgeball suffers. Had they decided to make it a true Underdog Story without the stupid jokes and unbelievable characters, I think this film would have been much better. Think about this... can you imagine Rocky as a funny film? And what is with the throwing of wrenches. What the film tells is that it's OK to throw wrenches at each other? How insane. At the end of the film the underdogs win, of course. I didn't expect it to be any different. Anyway, to sum it all up, I don't recommend wasting your money on this movie. It is not as good as the advertisers want you to believe."

Ben Stiller as a psychopathic gym owner obsessed with his own beauty is absolutely hilarious. His character's pathetic nature is amusing, unlike many of his co-star's, which is just sad. Vince Vaughn doesn't necessarily flop as the protagonist, but I thought he wasn't the best choice--while somewhat likable, he was still devoid of acting talent.<br/><br/>The other supporting stars are unremarkable. They're just there. They do what they're supposed to, and that's something, I guess.

The game appears to revolve around two teams throwing a ball as hard as possible at each other with the object of hitting an opponent with it. We may have to wait some time for the Joe DiMaggio of dodgeball to emerge I would imagine. Whatever its merits or otherwise as a game per se,whether it is a worthy subject for a feature film is certainly to say the least debatable. What is beyond debate is that ""Dodgeball"" is a movie that has been allowed to sprawl,start and stutter with no sign of a controlling hand until it peters out rather like a Monty Python sketch nobody could be bothered to think of an end for.

","Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughan) is the owner of Average Joe's Gym which is located next to Globo Gym which is a much larger multi-chain gym owned by obnoxious and self-obsessed White Goodman (Ben Stiller). When LaFleur discovers that he has 30 days to pay off $50,000 he panics and his first attempt at raising some quick cash fails. One of the members of his gym sees an advert in a magazine advertising a Dodgeball competition and the prize for winning the competition is $50,000. Seeing this as being their only option to earn that amount of cash in the time frame required, LaFleur and his gym members form a team and get trained by former Dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). However, when Goodman gets wind that LaFleur is entering into the Dodgeball championship he assembles his own crack team and enters the competition himself to win the money and put an end to LaFleur's hopes of saving his gymnasium.<br/><br/>The start of the film is quite impressive with Stiller's monologue being a parody of the sort of thing that you'd expect to see on Teleshopping or QVC. This aspect is funny as I myself don't take a lot of what these channels say seriously and I can see that this was the effect that was trying to be achieved here. The film then shifts focus on to Vaughan and it's clear to see that he's a pleasant enough person, but clearly has no idea how to run a business. The problems for me started when the film started to establish the actual plot....<br/><br/>Once the plot kicks in then it becomes fairly obvious that writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurber has gone for very easy targets in order to generate laughs (most of the 'laughs' on offer here stem from seeing people being hit with a ball). OK you may argue that it's a film about Dodgeball and that's the point. Fair enough... I would expect some of the laughs to stem from this, but surely a better scripted film would have us laughing at the characters for what they say as well as what they do. I'm not a fan of comedies that seem to just rely on physical humour as I think it's lazy and sadly this really is a lazy film. The characters all fall into the usual clichés with Thurber deciding that one of them should act like a pirate all the time which was never funny and grew more annoying as time passed.<br/><br/>The performances from Stiller and Vaughan weren't brilliant if we're honest; the former overacts most of the time and crosses the line between being funny and being annoying on almost every occasion. Vaughan fares slightly better as his performance feels more natural, but I still felt that he underplayed his role slightly meaning that I couldn't engage with him as a character quite as much as I should have done.<br/><br/>The final sequence of events seems to thrown in every single cliché in the book and all of these events lead to a fairly safe and predictable ending - barring one surprise that LaFleur has for Goodman which I'll admit was pretty funny (I liked that as I do like the idea of the little people getting the better of the big people).<br/><br/>All in all then Dodgeball is a fairly forgettable film with a fairly standard story which aims for cheap laughs far too often. For me, an underdog story will always have some merit, but the truth is that Dodgeball is too basic and just simply isn't funny enough."

Vaughn must come up with $50, 000 and the method of payment becomes a dodgeball competition, which Globo-Gym also enters. Dodgeball becomes the deciding factor. Effective premise exploits fitness clubs and the image pressure to look good. There are the expected clichés such as the stereotype players made up of characters more or less from better movies. Directed with comic insight by Rawson Marshall Thurber with many great sight jokes. Vaughn fares well as Average Joe's front man out to win this competition and gain predicted respect. Stiller steals scenes with his outlandish behaviour that will ultimately lead to his downfall. Christine Taylor plays an attorney in what can only be described as a romantic prop. Rip Torn plays an aged dodgeball trainer whose sudden dismiss seems too cliché. Then there are a slew of effective actors in comic form playing the standard dimwits who play types over personalities.

This film doesn't try to be anything other than what it clearly is, a complete dumbass of a film with in your face laugh out loud moments. Nothing here is clever or particularly original its just childish toilet humour utilising every trick in the book to get a giggle, no stone left unturned.<br/><br/>The cast is a mixture of some Frat pack members and good character actors who all take the opportunity to let loose and just play it to the extreme. Good old Ben Stiller has to be the main attraction here as the narcissistic gym owner with a Vidal Sassoon hair style. I did also enjoy the satirical take on flashy modern day gyms filled with overly tanned models who merely like to look at themselves whilst getting fit.<br/><br/>Stephen Root rehashes his 'Office Space' character to great effect, Alan Tudyk is a pirate, why? no idea but its amusing and Vince Vaughn simply plays the same regular Joe character he always does but he does it well doesn't he. There are many other funny performances here and quite a lot of cameos, too many to mention but none of them ever undermine the films comedy. Kinda funny seeing Lance Armstrong going on about his Tour De France victories though, ouch!<br/><br/>The whole idea here is so basic its amazing they got it off the ground really. Chock full of cheap laughs, naughty visual gags, lots of crotch slapstick, cheesy lines, weight jokes and pratfalls, the film does feel very infantile at times but at others it can be very funny indeed. Its not really about the plot for all intense and purposes, you just watch to see Vaughn, Stiller and co act the fool and crack hokey lines. Its all about the hammy acting and rude visual tomfoolery but the bonus is its a good little feel good flick too.<br/><br/>Yeah you know what will happen, you know the slimy slow witted Stiller will get his comeuppance in the end, there aren't any surprises here. You know exactly what you're paying for with this and you get it, like I say the film doesn't pretend to be anything else other than a stupid comedy much like 'Dumb and Dumber' or other frat pack flicks.<br/><br/>Upped to the max deliberately with daft spoof-like moments for optimal belly laughs and finishing off with the all too common parody of the classic coming from behind victory.

","This is a pretty funny movie about a group of underdogs and misfits, who enter a Las Vegas dodge-ball tournament in order to save their local gym from a much larger Global Gym run by muscular and athletic men.<br/><br/>At 92 minutes, this movie is pretty intriguing from start to finish, nothing too drawn out that would render the movie boring and unremarkable. The story goes straight to the point of pitting the average joes against the athletes, telling us that even if you do seem like an underdog or are outnumbered, your perseverance will triumph over your adversaries. There are some corny moments, but this movie isn't meant to be taken as a serious drama.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn does a pretty good job in his role leading the underdogs, and Ben Stiller does a devilish job in portraying the leader of the Global Gym, trying to buy off Vaugh's local and struggling gym. And, it is a real treat to see some cameos from big stars such as Chuck Norris, Gary Cole, William Shatner and David Hasselhoff.<br/><br/>Overall, a pretty fun film good for some laughs and surprises.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

","""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" finds a group of lazy, likable, poor, dysfunctional bums, who don't care about money, fitness or conformity, living opposite a super-gym filled with wealthy, hard-working, beautiful, Ubermensch. Our heroes beat the Ubermensch at a dodge-ball tournament, make millions of dollars and buy out the super gym. Message: it's okay to be who you are, because deep down you know you're better than all those ""conformists"" who do what you don't. You can do what they do and you can do it better. You are, and want, the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>To date, ""Dodgeball"" is the best film released by Ben Stiller's Red Hour Production company. Vince Vaughn plays our likable hero, Ben Stiller goes delightfully over-the-top as White Goodman (a health obsessed fitness instructor), and Christine Taylor plays the obligatory love interest. A bevy of goofy character-actors make up the rest of the film's oddball cast. Like most of Stiller's starring vehicles, ""Dodgeball"" is designed to covertly show off the time Stiller spends in the gym.<br/><br/>Most of the film's best jokes come from Stiller. His obsession with male beauty and virility mirrors the film's own obsession with balls. Interestingly, the film's love interest (Christine Taylor) is revealed to be bisexual, with no need for either Vaugn or Stiller. This revelation is perhaps a remnant of a scrapped, planned ending; the film originally ended with our heroes being beaten and remaining losers.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Worth one viewing."

","A supremely silly film from Ben Stiller, this film features the charismatic Vince Vaughn and Stiller's real-life wife Christine Taylor as well as Stiller himself as misanthropic meathead White Goodman whose financial prospects are on the rise, while those of Vaughn's Pete LaFleur are on the descent. Goodman's mustachioed, comedically hyper-masculine gym owner wants to take over LaFleur's gym and convert it into a parking lot for his own gym which he will get the opportunity to do if Vaughn and his small band of hapless, loyal members cannot raise $50,000 within the next month. Gordon (Stephen Root) reads in his obscure sports magazine about a dodgeball tournament of which the grand prize is $50,000.<br/><br/>So the band of ne'er-do-wells enters the tournament, not realizing how hapless they look-a man who thinks he is a pirate (Alan Tudyk), a man with no pride (Gary Cole), a man whose prime interest is in the most obscure sports around, and a young man whose cheerleading tryout left him the laughingstock of his school (Justin Long). Will they succeed in keeping the gym open? What do you think? This is cotton-candy thick entertainment. It's good for a few laughs. Justin Long, Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, and Stiller in particular are very good in their roles. If you like some of these actors and a light-hearted, enjoyable film, this one is for you."

","Although this sports comedy was released in 2004, I was introduced to it the following year. It was towards the end of my senior year of high school, in a class I was in all morning that semester. One day, for some reason, we didn't do any work, and instead spent the morning watching ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"". I recall not being very impressed with much of the film, but liking some of it. Three years and a few months later, having not seen it since then, I rented it yesterday. Now that I've seen it a second time, it's definitely clearer in my mind, but I don't think my second viewing was much different than the first at all.<br/><br/>Peter La Fleur owns an unpopular, rundown gym called Average Joe's, which does have a few loyal members, all with their eccentric qualities. Across the road is Globo Gym, a glamorous fitness centre run by the arrogant White Goodman, who wants to buy Average Joe's, so he can have it demolished and have a parking structure for his gym's members built in its place! In order to stop this from happening, La Fleur must come up with $50,000 within the next thirty days! He and his gym's loyal members attempt to make enough money in various ways, but unfortunately, all their attempts fail. Finally, it is discovered that they can get enough money to save Average Joe's if they win a big dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas. So, they begin to train for this tournament, but after Goodman finds out about this by spying on them, he gets together a team of extremely powerful athletes to participate in the dodgeball tournament as well, so it doesn't look like there's much hope for the Average Joes! <br/><br/>Like probably so many other modern comedies, some of the gags in this one are pretty lame, such as the obese cheerleader flashback, and the steroid user on the Girl Scout team. I would say the humour is pretty much mediocre for the most part, but it has its moments, such as White Goodman getting an electric shock when he touches a doughnut. One part which definitely made me laugh more than the vast majority of the movie was Goodman at the door of the house of attorney Kate Veatch, telling her about an absurd thing he just did, which was not his first pathetic attempt to win her over! The rest of that front porch sequence can be amusing as well, including Kate getting violent with White, and White's reaction. Occasionally, there are some more minor laughs. However, this is not the reason why I'm rating this movie any more than a 5/10. The reason for that is the fact that both times I've seen it, I've found the big dodgeball tournament rather suspenseful.<br/><br/>I've seen a number of Hollywood comedies made at some point during this decade, and I've definitely seen better than ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"", but have also seen much worse. Yes, this particular comedy can be quite juvenile at times, with certain gags it could have done without, and like I said, overall, the humour is mediocre in my opinion, but at least it's not atrocious, like some modern comedies certainly can be, and the story seemed to leave me reasonably satisfied in the end. Many people clearly like this film better than I do, and while it's certainly not one of the most popular comedies ever made, it seems to have gotten more positive feedback than negative, though I'll probably never be able to fully understand it. ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" definitely could have been a lot funnier, but compared to certain other immature modern comedies, it's certainly not exactly a disgrace."

William Shatner, Chuck Norris giving Average Joe's the nod, David Hasselhoff speaking German. He has spent time there being a singing sensation there.

","This movie represents everything that is wrong with the modern day American cinema. After viewing it, i just felt compelled to create an IMDb account and write out of me this awful feeling this movie has left me with. Where do i start? Oh, how about the movie not being funny at all to someone that isn't an 'average Joe'? It really goes to the lowest of the low, like Vaughn's team motto 'Aim low'. Guys, they even made Rip Torn say things like 'Crotch stain' and made a dirty old bastard out of him.... Oh, there's also Chuck Norris, god knows why.. and Captain Kirk. God, i feel dumb after watching this insult to my idea of Ben Stiller. I can see this piece of excrement be entertaining only to those who do not care, or the brain dead. Even Stiller makes a remark about this, in the last minute of this 'movie'. To sum it up, Bad guy pathetically comical + his towering team of ethnically diverse henchmen on steroids, Good guy charming underachiever (so the target audience doesn't get offended, and can identify) + a group of oddballs that don't deserve life (but the movie makes their existence meaningful) + a token black dude (blaxploitating away) + a pirate (??) whose entire self-image is based on what Vaughn's character has to say during a self doubt now - hero redeem later scene. We also have that guy from the 'Excalibur' SF series, playing the role of the commentator, i liked Excalibur, so i can forgive. Oh, there's a girl, naturally, a tough one, naturally, that slams Stiller's character into a wall, in order to prove that women are tough. Women are really tough right? Yeah, i thought so. Oh, she's also not a lesbian, she's Bi. Is there a category on this site for the worst scene ever? The scene where the heroine kisses another woman and her comment 'I'm not lesbian. {pause} I'm bi-sexual' to quell the attention of Vaughn's character and that of the black token is sickeningly unimaginative.

And it wasn't good-natured humour, it was very tense, and mean, and often there were long silences, And, at the point in which the actors leave, the tech-guys who are working with them on the commentary simply decide to put in the commentary from ""There's Something About Mary"", saying that ""no one will notice"". What was the point of including this drivel? Would it have not just been possible to not include the commentary, when it became obvious that the actors weren't going to cooperate? But no, instead they include a short while of the actors, first waiting for the Ben Stiller to show up, and then insulting each other, as well as the tech-guys, and then abandoning the commentary altogether - while using the commentary from something else completely, as filler!

No matter what type of comedy you like you will like this, its got randomness, some clever bits, and some just ridiculously stupid parts. i think that if you are looking for a good laugh, that you can have over and over and over again you should rush out RIGHT NOW and buy this film. After watching it and putting it back on the shelf along side all your other DVDs it starts calling to you wanting to be watched over and over again and in the end you will start to wonder how you actually got along without this film in your life! seriously if you haven already closed this window do it NOW and go buy this film!"

"Benjamin_Cox","6","0","1","19 May 2006"," Patchy effort lit up by show-stealing Rip Torn - 65%
","I always felt that this was one of those films that looked funny in the trailers but was actually a load of rubbish. Sport-based films tend to follow a very strict plot line and structure and this is their fatal flaw - an actual game where the underdogs win is genuinely exciting whereas the opposite is true if shown in movies. Increasingly, sport movies rely on comedy to help them through and ""Dodgeball"" is yet another of these tactless, in-yer-face comedies that are about as PC as Bernard Manning at a Women's Institute meeting. But sadly, it isn't as funny as it wants to be and is saved from total ignorance by a blistering performance from a veteran actor in a supporting role.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur, a regular everyman running a dilapidated gym called Average Joes opposite the corporate mega-structure of White Goodman's (Ben Stiller) Globo Gym. When Globo Gym threaten to take Average Joes over, Peter and his plucky group of losers find themselves entering a dodgeball competition in order to secure the prize money needed to keep them in business. But ego-maniacal fitness freak White is determined to get his way and enters his own team in the tournament. And given that both guys are chasing corporate lawyer Kate (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor), the clash is given an extra edge.<br/><br/>Given that this is the basic plot, you can probably see the movie's ending from here. In fact, the film very nearly falls apart midway through as it just gets sillier and sillier the longer it goes on and it's not that clever to begin with. ""Dodgeball"" is, at times, an idiotic incoherent mess that does nothing new or remarkable at all, despite a few glimpses of genuine laughs. So why isn't it a total failure, I hear you cry. Well, it's all down to Rip Torn's hilarious appearance as wheelchair-bound veteran dodgeball coach Patches O'Houlihan who has all the best lines, the best put-downs (""You're about as useful as a c***-flavoured lollipop"") and all the best scenes. He easily steals the film and when he's not there, the film really suffers although Stiller is also good as the obnoxious Goodman.<br/><br/>With a tighter script and more consistent laughs, this could have been fabulous. But being kept firmly on the sports-plot railroad merely adds to the film's problems. It's daft and only sporadically funny, relying on Rip Torn to carry it through. Like ""Anchorman"", it can't maintain the humour right the way through and by the time the film ends, the whole thing feels cobbled together rather amateurishly. It's a great pity because Rip Torn is simply brilliant in ""Dodgeball"" and probably deserves his own show. But nothing else can keep up with him. Even if you're familiar with the ""sport"" of dodgeball (which we aren't in the UK), this film won't completely bowl you over. ""Dodgeball"" - you're out!"

","In Australia, we called it poison ball in primary school, and I loved it. Well, in the US it's called Dodgeball, it's growing in popularity and it's now the backdrop for another comedy ""Brat Pack"" feature.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughan (Swingers) is Peter La Fleur, owner of cash-strapped Average Joe's gym  a gym for ""average Joes"". But the body-beautiful owner of Globo Gym, White Goodman (Ben Stiller) is moving in for a takeover. Until Peter and his buddies form a rag-tag team to compete at the Las Vegas Dodgeball championships for a $50,000 prize.<br/><br/>For most of its 92 minutes, Dodgeball is a hilarious homage cum parody of underdog sporting films. It's the first feature from writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber, who gave us Terry Tate, Office Linebacker.<br/><br/>There's some hilarious supporting characters  including Alan Tudyk (I Robot) as a pirate, and Missi Pyle as a scary Romanian Dodgeball champion. The comedy is rapid-fire and sometimes shocking  ""if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball"", says coach Rip Torn to the team. And there are some great cameos, including David Hasselhoff as an irate German coach.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story does ""drop the ball"" towards the end and get just too corny for its own good. The scene where Vaughan is motivated by cycling star and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong was very schmaltzy, perhaps because its status as parody was unclear. Yet, if you're looking for a film where laughter will be torn from you, submit to Dodgeball. The first half of the film is worth it."

Basically, I still don't like his face and his way of acting. But since I enjoyed MEET THE FOCKERS to some extend, I kinda took Stiller along for the ride with this one. And he's pretty superb in DODGEBALL, giving an over-the-top performance as prestigious fitness-club owner White Goodman. In fact he's so annoying, dislike-able and full of himself that I constantly wanted to hit him in the head. Real hard. So it was fun to see him suffer some defeats from time to time. But especially Vince Vaughn was good as the very likable, easy-going Peter La Fleur, White's rival in the fitness-business. There's not much else to say about this flick, except: go see it. It's got funny dialogues and one-liners including a lot of vulgar and offensive words.

"dee.reid","8","0","1","31 August 2005"," ""Dodgeball"" - A true underdog story?
","""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is hardly true in the sense that its plot line is based on an actual event or time in history. ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is only ""true"" in that dodgeball is slowly rising to the top of the ""almost sports"" world (presumably through the underground avenue of word-of-mouth) and what's more, a movie is made about dodgeball and it's directed by first-timer Rawson Marshall Thurber.<br/><br/>My own experiences in gymnasium dodgeball were all short-lived in the annals of elementary school, as like most others surprised by the massive success of this picture last summer, dodgeball, or Extreme Dodgeball as it's called on sports channel ESPN, is close to earning a place in the most-watched sports arena on television. Whoa.<br/><br/>But in the movie ""Dogdeball: A True Underdog Story,"" hapless, borderline bankrupt Average Joe's Gym owner Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) comes up with a scheme to win $50,000 in order to save his fledgling business. Actually, he doesn't come up with the plan himself; one of his equally hapless, bizarr-o but loyal gym regulars reads about dodgeball in ""Obscure Sports Quarterly.""<br/><br/>The catch is, they have all heard of and know how to play dodgeball, but they don't know how to play (play is italicized) dodgeball. As with any sport, officially sanctioned or not, there are rules and any advice that Peter and his cohorts come across is therefore invaluable if they are to get anywhere in the upcoming dodgeball tournaments being held in Las Vegas. And so with much pondering, a loose team is formed out of true societal misfits including a pirate, a wannabe cheerleader, and a guy who's never been on a date.<br/><br/>One of them borrows a documentary sports video from 1938, and it features legendary titan of the game Patches O'Houlihan (played by Hank Azaria in the video, a wheelchair-bound Rip Torn in the present). Soon enough, Patches rolls into Average Joe's and shows these 'dogs how to play some dodgeball in some very effective if not totally kosher techniques. Peter realizes that lawyer Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor), who has served him with the bank's foreclosure warnings and also gets wind of some of his lackadaisical business practices including letting his clients pay their own way, has a mutual disliking of White Goodman (a delightfully obnoxious, egomaniacal, and scene-chewing Ben Stiller), the owner of Globo Gym, and eventually asks her to join their team.<br/><br/>Of course, she's at first reluctant but after White gets her fired from her job with the bank, she is left with little choice but to join at least in part to get revenge on White. White Goodman is another one of those deliciously manic, comic villains that Stiller specializes in, chewing up scenery nearly every second the camera's focused on him. He forms his own dodgeball team, the Purple Cobras (who all look like action movie rejects, even though one of them is from an obscure place in the former Soviet Union), and with the sports winnings, he aims to buy out Peter's gym and then demolish it (with them still in it) but they're obviously not going away without a fight.<br/><br/>This is a movie that finally acknowledges its place as a wild, out-of-place, and self-referential sports comedy. No phony theatrics here, ladies and gentlemen, just a bunch of actors who know the material inside-out and look to make one hell of an entertaining picture. Vince Vaughn does his best to keep the plot on track with a cool game face and succeeds but Ben Stiller is a total maniac as White Goodman. Like the corporate fitness monster he played in ""Heavyweights"" (1995), he's totally insane but goes a step further into playing a character who if it weren't for a shred of brains in that thick melon on top of his shoulders, would be a poster child for self-absorbed fitness gurus everywhere.<br/><br/>Most entertaining are the actual dodgeball sequences, which eat up most of the film's second half. These are fast, brutal, and unflinching in showing various team members getting annihilated on the court with zingers to the face, to the crotch or any exposed area. It almost makes you want to sign up and form your own team and compete in Vegas.<br/><br/>""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is an eager film from an equally ambitious team of filmmakers. It put a smile on my face, as any other sports film of similar theme would not have been able to do that. Sure it's silly, but the laughs are such that you won't be kicking yourself afterward for doing so.<br/><br/>""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" - Don't dodge it. Oh, wait, catch it. Ahh, screw this, watch this movie, turn your brain off, and enjoy it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Dodgeball is one of the most stupid, retarded movies I ever saw, and I absolutely loved it. The jokes in this movie are so bad, they're actually good. The story is standard good versus evil. The good guys are the underdogs from Average Joe's Gym, the bad guys are the muscular show offs from Globo Gym. And of course there's the love interest in the middle of the two protagonists: Christine Taylor (aka ms. Stiller). From there on it's all about slap stick and absurd dialogues. Try picturing a bunch of losers getting hit by wrenches thrown by a lunatic in a weelchair. Picture Ben Stiller as a wacky mustached work out guy getting aroused by putting a slice of pizza in his pants. This is what Dodgeball has to offer. One of the sparkling high lights of this movie is Stillers overacting in contrast with Vince Vaughns easy going 'play'. You're in for some stupid dialogues, man o man. If you want sophisticated humour in the likes of Woody Allen, than you rang the wrong door bell mister.

"Anonymous_Maxine","6","0","1","23 April 2005"," Some funny parts, more stupid parts.
","It should be noted that stupid parts are often funny, too, I still haven't figured out what it is exactly that makes one stupid scene funny and another one just stupid and vulgar. The mashed potato scene in Scary Movie 2, for example, was not funny by any stretch of the imagination. If you really liked that, you should try hanging out in a mental hospital or a physical therapy ward or something, you will be in absolute hysterics. Then again, I loved the Ace Ventura films, and stupidity is the foundation for most of the successful comedy in it, at least to me. Now, when I watch a comedy like Dodgeball, clearly I am looking at the ratio to stupid scenes that don't work and stupid scenes that work. Dodgeball had more of the former. <br/><br/>The story is about a regular guy who owns a gym and an obscenely rich and snobby guy who owns a massive gym across the street from him and who spends not a little bit of time trying to run the average guy out of business. Thhe initial problem that I had was that Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller are very different actors, not the least reason for which is that Vaughn can play characters as different as the characters he played in Clay Pigeons and The Cell, whereas Stiller plays exactly the same character in every movie, he only seems to alter how irritating his characters are (think Meet the Parents vs. his character here). Then again, he capitalizes on his weaknesses, kind of like David Spade. <br/><br/>But in the movie, Vaughn reminds me of a guy dealing with some drunken jerk at a party, trying to shrug off his ridiculous and embarrassing behavior but eventually giving in and knocking the guy on his ass. Stiller is so over the top that there is no way to take him any more seriously than as a comic book villain. He is tiring to watch before the first third of the movie is over. <br/><br/>There are effective gags in the movie, it is not all bad. The plot is fun to watch, because not only is White Goodman (Stiller) annoying to watch, but he is also a complete jerk, so you really want to root for the underdogs, and the movie makes very sure that you see them as underdogs in every way imaginable. But it should be noted that the best scene in the movie involves Vince Vaughn at the airport, having given up on his team, when he runs into someone that I won't reveal. They have a normal conversation, no over-the-top antics, and it's the funniest thing in the movie.<br/><br/>Then again, maybe I just thought so because I enjoy ridiculously long bike rides."

","I'm not trying to convince anyone who saw this that they viewed a bad film because nothing is more subjective than comedy and I do believe that there are some solid laughs found here but many of the subplots in this story are just so obvious and predictable. Story is about Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who manages a small and rundown gym called ""Average Joe's"" but with his pathetic group of members he doesn't make much money and now the bank needs $50,000 or they're going to take it away from him.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** White Goodman (Ben Stiller) runs a very successful gym also and he won't stop at anything to get his hands on Peter's and he even agree's to give him more than $50,000 but that doesn't convince Peter to sell. Peter is convinced by his members that they should join the Dodgeball League and try and win the championship prize in Las Vegas but what finally spurns him on to the idea is the help from Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) who is a dodgeball teacher and Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) who works for the bank.<br/><br/>This film is directed by newcomer Rawson Marshall Thurber who benefits from the opportunity to work with a cast that has been in several goofy comedies reminiscent of this and they together make this film work on several levels. The story is slapstick with so many jokes and humorous situations tossed in that you can make a case that it resembles the ""Airplane"" films but the main problem I had with this is the predictability of most of the situations and it's characters. Was is really surprising to see the one nerdy character who wanted to be a cheerleader end up with the hot chick from his school? Did anyone believe Taylor's character would be attracted to Vaughn and that she would even get involved with dodgeball? Sure, I'm nit-picking but these were such glaring aspects of the story that it's shocking to me that the makers of this film don't realize how cheesy they are and just change it. If you love Stiller and his over the top comedies than you'll no doubt enjoy this effort but for me I found too many parts of the film cartoonish to allow myself to admit this as a guilty pleasure."

","Vince Vaughn leads a group of assorted misfits into a dodgeball tournament to save his gym from being bought by Ben Stiller's gym franchise. Well leads is to strong a word, as Vince just seems to go with the flow throughout the film. Are we that needy for good comedies that we elevate a below-average one into the status of 'mordern day classic'?? Apparently so as many of the people I know sung it's high praises when this came out. The truth is, this is nowhere near as funny as either ""Old School"" OR ""Bad Santa"" and the only laughs to be had come from not Stiller nor Vaughn, but from Rip Torn who steals every single scene he has in the movie as wheelchair-bound Patrick O'houlihan.

","I have never seen a more unoriginal movie in my life. Every single joke, gag or pun in Dodgeball is blatantly and openly stolen from another movie. And this really, really bugs me. However I did laugh constantly and it was enjoyable.<br/><br/>Though I must confess my hatred of Ben Stiller and his insistence to crank out 200 unfunny films a year (a schedule typically reserved for porn stars). Initially, I hated Vince Vaughn and liked Stiller. But now that's kind of flip-flopped. After Vaughn's funny performance in Old School I warmed to him but Stiller is under the impression that everything he does is funny. He certainly is not; anyone can act like a jerk.<br/><br/>The plot is old hat. But Vaughn's ragtag group of losers and their determination to win the Dodgeball tournament is the real laugh machine. Though I was constantly thinking about how they worked much better in Baseketball or Kingpin.<br/><br/>Asides from Vaughn and the so-not-funny anymore Stiller the cast is good. Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan is amusing (though he did the exact same role in Summer Rental), Stephen Root (that's Bill Dauterive for all you King of the Hill fans) was my fave and there's plenty of cameos from the likes of Hank Azaria, Jason Bateman, William Shatner, David Hasselhoff and Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>Funny it may well be but expect practically every laugh to come with a heavy sense of Déjà vu. I wouldn't bother buying the DVD when it comes out.

","I played a lot of dodgeball when I was in school and at day camp and I remember how much fun it was. This movie wasn't any fun. I had high hopes for it because I think Vince Vaughn is very good at picking his material and I figured watching people getting smacked in the face with a red gym ball should be good for a few laughs. It has a few laughs, but that's about it. Most of the film is un-watchable. Ben Stiller's role as an over testosterone gym owner wears very thin after a few minutes and becomes annoying after that. His character got on my nerves in a hurry. A lot of the humor I didn't find all very funny and I thought most of it was predictable. What I did like was Rip Torn as Patches, a sort of former dodgeball legend, who is now in a wheelchair barking orders like a drill sergeant. He has a very funny bit where he is tossing wrenches at his team and then forcing them to dodge traffic on a busy highway. Most of them get hit by a car. It pretty much ends there for me as the laughs go. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but I was hoping for something better than this. (*1/2)"
"Robert_duder","Null","0","1","4 December 2004"," Oh so very popular!
","I admit...Ben Stiller's popularity is a head scratcher to me. Even comedians I can't stand like Parker and Stone of South Park fame I can still see something appealing in their style. Ben Stiller to me seems kinda silly yet I admit I have enjoyed a fair number of his films. Still it's usually the rest of the cast that makes the film good. To me he's just okay and yet his films seem to reach this cult status in days where everyone is talking about them. Such is the case with Dodgeball. I've been hearing about this movie everywhere I went and how funny it was and I had to see it so I finally did and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Dodgeball is the story of two men. Peter Lafleur played by Vince Vaughn and White Goodman played by Ben Stiller. Stiller's character owns a popular, and well to do gym where people are insulted into building better bodies. Vaughn's character owns a small neighborhood gym where good friends hang out, have a good time and people can come without being judged or laughed at. Unfortunately Lafleur is too nice of a guy to make a profit off all his clients so he's in trouble financially and the bank is going to foreclose on his gym leaving it available for hostile takeover by Goodman unless he can come up with fifty thousand dollars in a month to save his gym from the evil Goodman. How is he going to do that? Dodgeball of course. Him and his gym full of out of shape rejects are going to win a national Dodgeball competition in which the top prize is...fifty thousand dollars. Surprised??<br/><br/>No it's not a new concept but the Dodgeball angle is different and very funny.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn is one of my least favorite actors because in essence he doesn't seem like an actor at all. He's just always kinda there. He's never impressed me in his variety of roles where he seems to ride the other people's coat tails in the film. He is adequate in the lead here playing a straight faced boring character. Ben Stiller is the exact polar opposite. He's off the wall, over the top, too much to handle and not all that funny. Both of them behave as though this is an extended Saturday Night Live Skit with special guest star Vince Vaughn who is just completely amused by Stiller and his own performance. <br/><br/>The absolute saviours of this film are the underdogs and the cameos. Truly they make this film a shining star and a funny, watchable movie. Christine Taylor as the lead actress in the film adds a necessary boost of girl power to the film. She's funny in her own way with her one liners. Stephen Roote is downright hilarious as Gordon the King of The Hill Billesque type character we know and love. Alan Tudyk as a basket case that thinks he's a pirate, and the silently hilarious Jamal Duff as Stiller's right hand man. Rip Torn who plays the Underdogs coach, former pro dodgeballer Patches O'Houllian has some hilarious lines and is just funny to watch, probably one of the best roles in the film. Cameo's by Chuck Norris, William Shatner who is funny without trying to be, and watch for Jason Bateman's hilarious little role as the more than slightly high dodgeball announcer. If the whole football in the groin premise makes you laugh aloud, you won't be able to get enough of Dodgeball because the funniest parts are watching people get nailed with those balls and of course the numerous references to ""balls"" in general. <br/><br/>Although there is the occasional sexual reference, overall the film doesn't resort to the gross out comedy we have come to expect nowadays from comedies. It's by far not the best comedy I have ever seen but it's worth checking out for a mindless laugh. 6/10"

","I was disappointed after watching the DVD. I saw Dodgeball in the theatre and the DVD cut out a major scene which would make the end confusing to people who will see the movie for the first time from the DVD version. In the theatrical version, Peter tells off his friends and Steve the Pirate following Patch's death. There was a scene in the theatrical version where Peter got upset with his friends that they relied on him for all the answers. Peter also yelled at Steve and told him to stop acting like a pirate because he wasn't one. In the DVD version they jump from Peter telling Kate that he is going to talk to the guys to the scene in Peter's hotel room where White is waiting to bribe Peter. (Now to explain why this would confuse first time viewers) At the end of the film Steve the pirate turns normal; he cuts his hair and dresses like an average person. He shows up at the end of the last Dodgeball match and tells Peter he was right about [Steve] not being a pirate...so I don't remember anywhere in the DVD where Peter told Steve that he wasn't a pirate! But that was in the theatrical version! What happened?"

","Vince Vaughn, plays a benevolent easy going gym owner (Peter La Fleur) who's nemesis, played by Ben Stiller (White Goodman) is a calculating and miscreant gym owner, who through his own brand of tough-love discipline and underhanded business practices has allowed his gym to sky rocket while Peter La Fleur's (Vaughn) easy going nice attitude has pushed his under. In order to win money to save his gym from foreclosure and eventual repurchase by Stiller, Vaughn takes a band of rag-tag misfits who call his gym home and along with Patches O'Houlihan (Played by Rip Torn) whips them into champions.<br/><br/>On the positive side, this movie had a lot of subtle and not so subtle jabs, with many different types of humor, slap-stick, gag and other types strewn into the piece. However where this virtual cavalcade of comedy falls a bit short and only results in a bit of comedic overload, spreading a potentially good concept for a film a bit thin.<br/><br/>First off the main conflict is one essentially where, a harder working businessman outwitted a slacker, who for some reason has a business and doesn't collect any money from his clients. For all intensive purposes this conflict is understandable and that's when I asked myself why should I feel sorry for these guys?<br/><br/>The characters are not very well developed, Ben Stiller's character (White), is a miscreant tyrant and Stiller brings a lot to this character. I however found him very similar in his stupidity to Zoolander, but with similar endearingness of that character. I didn't feel much of a connection with any of the other antagonists however. I found that they were not developed, even to comedy movie standard. For instance one of the main gym (rejects) is a pirate, a mild-mannered loser, while another just a simpleton. All these characters in turn are not given as much dimension as they could have, leaving out connection with them tenuous are best. <br/><br/>Like the main conflict and the main characters much of this movie is based on comedic stereotypes which work well in certain circumstances and not so well in others. As mentioned previously one of the main comedic short comings is the inundation of copious amounts of comedic events that come up a bit short.<br/><br/>As far as Beb Stiller movies go, this one is certainly not on part with Zoolander, which is a better buy if you haven't seen it.

","I only nipped on here quickly to pen a few lines on Dodgeball, but thought I would read a few other reviews quickly. I'm amazed to learn it was a comedy.<br/><br/>I watched it on a plane which I now feel let down by, as at least having been in a cinema, I could've at least have been made aware of the scenes I was supposed to laugh at.<br/><br/>If it was meant to be slap stick it was a poor mans Airplane or Naked Gun. How many more of these 'Groups of Misfits decide to enter a sports competition and ... wait for it ... they win - and beat a load of pros along the way' films will we get? We've had Major League, Up N Under, a million football ones. They're all exactly the same but with a different shaped ball.<br/><br/>The dodge ball game itself seemed quite enjoyable, but would've been better if they devoted a few minutes more to the game and less time or pathetic, supposedly amusing incidents. In the first game against the Girl Guides, fair enough - have some of the players be hit in the face & knocked out by a ball. But we had about a dozen matches of this in all. It was exactly the same situations recycled with different characters over & over again.<br/><br/>The Ben Stiller character was so over the top it was ridiculous. Likewise, so were all the opposition teams: Lumberjacks, the Japanese. They didn't add anything that having 6 ordinary looking blokes in shorts & a T Shirt would have had, the Average Joe team (with the exception of the thin geeky bod who was an outstanding character) offered nothing remotely amusing and quite what the point of the co-commentator alongside Gary Cole was, I will never know. Vince Vaughn is a good actor & always strikes me as good decent bloke, but I'm still unsure as to what his best acting role is. It wasn't this. He was actually one of the best things about Dodgeball, but (and I can't put my finger on exactly what) something didn't seem right with his role here.<br/><br/>Humour always loses credibility for me, when reality has to be suspended so much that things that would normally kill someone ie Spanners being thrown into someones head barely even graze someone. It's no different to having someone fall 500 feet off a mountain, then when they land just get up & brush themselves down and walk away unscathed.<br/><br/>That's fine in cartoons (when the bump on the forehead is just pressed back into place) but I can't see it as comedy in supposed films for grown-ups, if that it what this was. Even in cartoons, and something as brilliant - and as funny - as the Simpsons, Homer bouncing down a cliff and being fine, is one of the few criticisms you can level at it.<br/><br/>Thankfully the plane began it's descent 10 minutes from the end of this film so I missed that but it wouldn't take Einstein to work out that Average Joe's Gym must have either won the match or lost it but then clawed victory from the jaws of defeat thanks to another technicality.<br/><br/>I like Ben Stiller in Meet The Parents and one or two other films but that is purely on an acting or characters basis. Unfortunately this is now, I think 6 films and he is still yet to make me laugh or even raise a snigger.<br/><br/>3/10"

A good performance from Vince Vaughn, especially considering that he was given little to work with, and a reasonable one from Christine Taylor, couldn't save this film from being a cheesy turkey that misses the mark as often as the misfit dodgeball team it portrays.

Cameos from some of the most annoying people to ever be on film (William Shatner, Chuck Norris, David Hasselhoff and dull bicycling wonder-man Lance Armstrong) and stupid commentary from annoying announcers Gary Cole and Jason Bateman during the final stages of the production coincide to complete a thoroughly mediocre comedic effort. For once I think that Stiller should have been around more often as he is the only real life blood in this stinker as ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" finally gets decapitated by elements much more lethal than flying rubber spheres (things like bad writing, poor direction, ho-hum acting and waning attempts at cheap laughs are commonplace throughout).

"Quinoa1984","7","0","1","20 June 2004"," Funniest Sports Comedy since BASEketball (and, luckily, in that comedic tradition)
","One of the things that debut filmmaker Rawson Marshall Thurber gets right at the start of Dodgeball, and runs with for the whole length of the film, is that if you're making a film out of this story (that includes the a-typical story and characters, in a comedy genre or otherwise) there's got to be a laugh a minute, literally.  And, amazingly, Thurbert pulls it off, along with a great ensemble cast headed by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn.  Because there is also a constant urge to make fun of anything, that nothing is out of bounds, disbelief is completely suspended, and Thurber reaches (credible) ZAZ comedy territory.<br/><br/>Main baseline: Stiller and Vaughn trade places from March's Starsky and Hutch, as Stiller plays the tyrannical, egocentric head of Globo-Gym, which has been the monopolizer of physical fitness in the town.  Vaughn runs Average Joe's, a gym where the only people who work out are the ones who work there.  When Stiller bids to take over Vaughn's place, they fight back with a Dodgeball tournament with a prize enough to save Average Joe's. <br/><br/>
The story's just an excuse, anyway, as was the story for BASEketball or Airplane.  It's an excuse, so to speak, to let Stiller run wild with the persona he creates for White Goodman.  It's an original performance, even if one wonders if he played a character with these kind of qualities before on his show.  And Vaughn, as well as the assortment of supporting actors (Christine Taylor, Alan Tudyk, Stephen Root, Justin Long, Joel Moore, and especially Rip Torn), contribute a lot to the success of the laughs. They're relying on certain cliches, but they're the kind of cliches you can't take a bit seriously.  There are also a good deal of (surprise) cameos by the likes of William Shatner, Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong that sneak up and bring some of the funniest parts of the film.

You know the ending before it happens, hell, you even know most of the jokes and the dialog seems to have been written as a prequel to most of the comedies recently past. I know Hollywood ran out of ideas around the mid-Nineties and had to look to its successful past to get ""new"" ideas for the future, and it seems lately its a free-for-all on the old original stories, repackaged for an unassuming public....but the saddest fact of all isn't that most of the viewing public is ignorant to this fraud, it's the fact that they resign themselves to that fate by not investigating older movies and truly comedic films that deserve their money and attention."

","I'm pretty sure the writers and producers of Dodgeball just got together one day and decided that the only reason Baseketball was a flop was because it wasn't based on a real sport. So they took Baseketball, every single idea and clever little touch, repackaged it and decided that the movie really needed to suck. Enter Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.<br/><br/>Let me get to the nitty gritty: Vince Vaughn sleeps his way through the flick, the rest of the cast are completely forgettable and filled with lame gimmicks, and the only one with any energy is Stiller. He delivers another over the top, trying to hard for his own good, performance. (And I don't know about you, but I really don't think he's very funny at all. Sure, Something about Mary was good, but I don't think I've seen anything else, with him, where I was really just laughing like crazy). About the only great thing about the flick is Rip Torn. The guy is great and delivers some of the best lines that I've ever seen. He's about the only reason that I laughed throughout the film. The whole thing just seemed pretty trite and about as deep as a kiddie pool.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and spend your money renting Baseketball. It's much funnier, and at least you'll save the extra twenty you'd normally spend on popcorn and soda.<br/><br/>4/10"
