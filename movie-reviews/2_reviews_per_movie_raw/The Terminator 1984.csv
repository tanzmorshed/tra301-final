","Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).<br/><br/>As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies "" Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again. ""  That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.<br/><br/>This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One, this is the first film where ""I'll be back"" was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he's in.  Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.<br/><br/>A great film."
"PhilipJames1980","9","27","29","25 February 2005"," The ultimate blend of Orwell and action
","Even in this post-Matrix era, this movie is still the ultimate blend of Orwell and action. If the definition of a classic is a movie that's often imitated but never equaled, then The Terminator is definitely a classic, because the increasing redundancy of its sequels and imitations merely demonstrates how good the original is.<br/><br/>I wasn't fortunate enough to see this movie in the year of its release, the year predicted by Orwell's classic novel as a time when technology would be used to enslave people, but I did see it in about 1992, when the blockbuster success of the first sequel made me curious to watch the first film. At that time I preferred the second Terminator movie for being technically superior, but after all these years I now prefer the first film's raw intensity and kinetic energy.<br/><br/>The Terminator was of course the breakthrough movie for James Cameron, and even after Aliens and Titanic it's still arguably his best-directed film. I challenge anybody to watch this movie and point out one single shot that needs improvement, because the direction of this movie is so fluid and precise that I can't think of one moment in the whole 100-minute running time that I would want to change.<br/><br/>Cameron was and of course still is a notorious perfectionist who's very difficult to work with, but his perfectionism really paid off with this movie because it can be watched again and again without losing its entertainment value. He's a master of the small touch, as when the cop at the desk is filling out his paperwork with a small pencil and pauses in mid-sentence to look up and see the headlights coming towards him through the doors.<br/><br/>Cameron also co-wrote the story, so this movie meant even more to him personally than merely a directing triumph. Supposedly he drew his inspiration from a nightmare in which he was being chased by a humanoid with one glowing red eye, and indeed the whole film has the urgent, oppressive atmosphere and calm logic characteristic of a nightmare. But of course he was probably also remembering subconsciously a couple episodes of The Outer Limits that he saw as a kid, which explains why he had to acknowledge the writer Ellison in the credits.<br/><br/>Besides Cameron, this movie really belongs to the three lead actors. Arnold of course gives the performance of his career in this movie, but then so do Linda and Michael. Arnold's physical presence and harsh accent have never been put to better use in a movie, while Linda never had another role that required her to run through such a full range of emotions--sweetness and vulnerability, toughness and despair, etc.<br/><br/>Michael has always been a B actor, but since The Terminator is essentially a B movie he fits in perfectly. His performance proves that an action hero is much more compelling when he's vulnerable not only to physical pain but emotional difficulties, to which his big, haunted eyes are put to good use. Watch him in this movie, as a man thrown out of his time but with a mission, and you'll see a perfect match of actor and character.<br/><br/>In a typical action film, the amount of violence and bloodshed in The Terminator would be excessive, but in a movie about an unstoppable killing machine the envelope can be pushed. In one of the more memorable set-pieces, the Terminator takes on an entire police station full of thirty cops, and although I didn't exactly count them the viewer gets the sense of watching every single cop being gunned down.<br/><br/>Ordinarily I wouldn't describe such a scene of slaughter as ""cool,"" and yet there is some-thing undeniably cool about Arnold, with his sunglasses and leather jacket, going through the station with a shotgun and assault rifle and taking on everybody. Arnold's charisma helps the audience stomach the cold-blooded determination of the Terminator, but also the character's single-mindedness invites admiration: even as we're appalled by all the killing, we have to admit he does it rather well.<br/><br/>This movie has more than enough gunfire, explosions and stunt-work (including some especially good stunt driving) to work purely as an action picture, but it's the film's anti-technology paranoia that makes it more than just an exciting ride. Notice, for example, the subtle role that Sarah's answering machine plays in the story: the cops can't get into touch with her because of it, while the message she leaves on it brings the Terminator right to her.<br/><br/>In one memorable shot, the tracks of a construction crane become those of a killing machine in the future, crushing an endless row of skulls, which you can interpret any number of ways (is it a crack against urban renewal?). Also note that the criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper, and that even in the post-apocalyptic future in which machines have destroyed the world children still huddle around a television set in a desperate effort to be entertained.<br/><br/>Some viewers may be turned off by this movie's preaching, but one quality that distinguishes The Terminator from its countless imitations is the strength of its convictions. Too many science-fiction/action movies fail under the weight of their own camp, but The Terminator is an exception because it actually has the nerve to take itself seriously. The bickering between seasoned cops Paul and Lance provides some levity, but at no point does the film make fun of itself.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm not giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is, after all, The Terminator, and not Casablanca. If people still remember it in forty years, then I'll give it a 10."
"Old Joe","Null","117","138","10 February 2002"," Arnie is cool as the bad guy, in this classic 80's action film!
","It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.<br/><br/>In 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg  a terminator  back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?<br/><br/>Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.<br/><br/>Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease. <br/><br/>The director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film. <br/><br/>There are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood's most famous lines in it, that of Arnie's 'I'll be back', a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.<br/><br/>So, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too 'eightish', and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set. I must admit the first time I saw it, I did not appreciate Terminator like I do now. Perhaps I found it a tad violent, but that is to be expected of a film that is called Terminator. This movie was a great success and deserved to be with all the great work that was put into it. However more was to come, a film that was to become one of the greatest sequels in movie history. Arnie was to deliver on his promise of 'I'll be back'!<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5 stars or 9/10"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","286","350","4 August 2002"," This is the movie that made a big break through for sci-fi movies!!!!
","The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity. One is heavily muscular; the other man, slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named ""Sarah Connor"", using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last Sarah Connor, he is stopped by the other man, Kyle Reese who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage, Reese explains that the man hunting Sarah is actually a cyborg assassin called a ""Terminator"", built by Skynet, an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future, Reese explains, Skynet gained self-awareness, initiated a global takeover of military hardware, and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. John Connor, Sarah's son, rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign, the human resistance was on the verge of victory; in a last-ditch effort, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John was born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. Reese volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect Sarah; after his use of the time transportation equipment, it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain, has no emotions, and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.<br/><br/>The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah, the effects are very 80's, but for the time and even to this day, I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything: action, romance, horror, sci-fi, and even some dark humor. The reason why Arnold's ""I'll be back"" is so famous is not just because of his accent, but because you knew that something bad was coming. Kyle Reese's ""Come with me if you want to live"" is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator, I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed, if you are, get a CAT scan.<br/><br/>10/10"
"MovieAddict2016","10","277","339","5 June 2003"," The best of the best in its genre...
","Rarely has a film so frightened an audience as ""The Terminator."" After its release in 1984, the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner broke box office records, and gave audiences something more to fear. Through the years, there have been stories of nature's beasts, of creatures from another world, and so on and so forth. ""Jaws"" was terrifying because it seemed so possible. And if ""Jaws"" is terrifying, ""The Terminator"" is horrific. The realization of this hit-man machine dawned on everyone watching the film. In a time of exceeding technology, how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like ""The Terminator."" <br/><br/>In ""The Terminator,"" Arnold plays a cyborg, Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, whatever that means. He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soon-to-be-mother of the future world leader, John Connor (who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising). If Connor is killed, then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future, and they will triumph. This would be pretty bad. So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time, to help save his mother. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tells Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) about the machine that is trying to kill her. ""It can't be bargained with, it can't feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead!"" Talk about a bad day.<br/><br/>The Terminator hunts them down time after time, including the famous police station scene, where Arnie says, ""I'll be back,"" and returns moments later, crashing through the wall in a car. He then takes on a whole squad of cops, but don't worry, Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed.<br/><br/>There are countless classic scenes in ""The Terminator."" You will see them spoofed your entire life. From the image of the Terminator, to the lines they speak, to the scenes they act out. Everything is spoofed. And the film is worthy of its fame.<br/><br/>On the special edition ""T2"" DVD (the second one), there is an on-set documentary for the making of the ""Terminator 2"" 3-D ride at Universal Studios. As the camera moves around, it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene. Some guy suggests something else, and Cameron gets a tone. ""No, no, that won't work. You do it like this - we come off here, he walks around..."" etc. The point is, he's a perfectionist, and a demanding director. Some directors are a bit too easy, and don't really care where their films are going. But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants, and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done. And it shows in his work. It's hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film. And it's even harder to find plot holes.<br/><br/>Some people say ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"" is better than the original. It's hard to choose, because the two films are very different. I view ""The Terminator"" as more of a deep, intellectually-consuming, dark thriller. I view ""Judgment Day"" as an action film, with a more or less recycled plot. (The plot is still good, but it's still the same, too.) It's hard to choose a favorite because they are so different. On ""T2"" the budget is ten times larger, probably even more than that. But if you want a horror/thriller, ""The Terminator"" is better for you. If you want special-effects and a really fun time, see ""T2."" They're both excellent films.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" is a great movie. It is one of my favorites; it is terrifying, horrifying, and 100 % entertaining. And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there, ""The Terminator"" has some thought put into its plot, and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind."

","The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.<br/><br/>""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead! ""<br/><br/>This is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.<br/><br/>Two naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.<br/><br/>James Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.<br/><br/>Brad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences, car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film: Photoplay 
 and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero, but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough. <br/><br/>Before Sarah Connor was a tough bad-ass gun guerilla squad in the sequels, here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic, brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being. <br/><br/>Lance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.<br/><br/>Paul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun. <br/><br/>This movie has ton's of action: You see a lot of automatic weapons, shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.<br/><br/>When we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah. <br/><br/>The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.<br/><br/>10/10 Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film, a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is Schwarzenegger's best film with Predator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day I highly recommend those three films."

"axlrhodes","10","45","52","28 January 2011"," The Terminator has heart. Cameron might be well advised,less is more.
","Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it's release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more."
"DaRick89","10","119","146","22 January 2006"," The wonderful action movie which started a wonderful action saga
","The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this, there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such, this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling, almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions, which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre, because of it's well thought-out plot, splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.<br/><br/>Now to analysing why the plot is so well-thought out. Well, for one thing, the concept of preventing or setting in stone the future by going back in time was one which wasn't really explored in those days. By exploring it, the Terminator was offering something different, something which has inspired films such as Back to the Future (read the plot synopsis for that film, there are a few similarities). The notion of the final battle of a future war being fought in 'our present', not in the future, between one member of opposing sides, in this case a man and a machine, is also an intriguing one and sets the stage for an exciting battle royale.<br/><br/>I'll run down the plot while I'm here. Sarah Connor, a young woman in her 20's, is the protagonist of the film and our two from the future, Kyle Reese and the Terminator, revolve around her. Reese, who is a battle-hardened soldier who has led a hard life in the wasteland which is the future, must protect Sarah, while the Terminator, an unstoppable cyborg, must kill her, in order to kill her unborn son, the leader of the future resistance.<br/><br/>All of this leads to some thrilling action scenes and insane explosions, topped off by music scores which add to the tension and excitement. The movie purrs into action quickly, but really kicks off at a disco, where Reese and the Terminator have a shootout, resulting in a city-wide drive-by chase involving the police which doesn't really let up until Reese and Sarah are arrested. During the lull in the chase scene, Reese tells Sarah about himself, the Terminator and their general predicament, which is fairly realistic. <br/><br/>The next action scene is the infamous police station massacre which everyone seems to talk about whenever they discuss this movie. I can understand why, too. The Terminator pretty much kills every cop in his path with the greatest of ease, either with the AK-47, his shotgun, or both. He also ends up cutting the power and setting the station on fire, again adding to the tension and excitement. <br/><br/>The last action scene which, like the one in T2, is a chase which leads to a final showdown in a building. It is a slight letdown, but it is still an intense scene. I will refrain from spoiling the ending, as this is too good a movie to be spoiled.<br/><br/>All of the acting fits the bill perfectly. As in T2, there is not a single bad performance to be found. Michael Biehn delivers a remarkably intense performance as Kyle Reese, acting like a typical human would in his situation. He displays his range of emotions at the right times, from passionate to worried to unyielding. It is a wonder that his only other major movie is 'Aliens' and that he is starring in stuff like 'Clockstoppers' these days. Linda Hamilton again does well as Sarah Connor, displaying an innocent woman who shows over the course of the film why she is John Connor's mother, displaying previously unheralded steel at the crunch. The support cast isn't too bad either (Dr. Silberman makes his first appearance). But again, the best performance in the film belongs to the bad guy, in this case, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He acts like a killing machine should; incredibly cold, sterile, soulless and unyielding. His facial expression never changes throughout the film and his physical appearance makes him slightly more imposing and intimidating than the Liquid Terminator. He also commences his famous one-liners which have been the subject of many a spoof, including (no, especially) ""I'll be back."" This is undoubtedly his best performance, even though it is not his only good one.<br/><br/>I will compliment all involved on making a movie which still manages to look good despite having a low budget. I've seen pretty bad-looking movies with fairly high budgets (read: Scooby-Doo), but never good-looking movies with low budgets.<br/><br/>In the end, The Terminator is a masterful action movie which laid the groundwork for the equally brilliant Terminator 2. If you asked me whether I preferred The Terminator or T2, I would say T2 because I am more familiar with it, otherwise, these two would be on a level footing. If you haven't seen this movie and are an action movie fan, then see it immediately. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.<br/><br/>5/5 stars"
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","10","118","151","30 January 2005"," An excellent film, highly original
","Terminator is an extremely low budget movie. In fact, just about everything used in it didn't cost much at all, but it is a very effective movie. Back in the '70's and 80's, movies could be very low budget, but still be great(think of John Carpenter's Halloween).<br/><br/>The Terminator is a story about how nuclear war causes the end to mankind and the end result could be the start of an even greater tragedy than the war its self. The entire message of The Terminator is an anti nuclear war message.<br/><br/>Many people think that a few parts in the beginning of the movie are just some random things thrown in. I can understand why, but these seemingly random scenes actually do have a lot to do with the story.<br/><br/>Arnold does a great job as the cyborg who is programmed to kill without mercy or remorse. For those who don't know, this is the movie where the line ""I'll be back"" was spoken. The other actors do a good job in this. Linda Hamilton made a great choice doing this movie and she really improved her career through it(the movie she made before this was the horrible Children Of The Corn).<br/><br/>This is better than Terminator 2(which is still great by the way), because this movie has more of a story and is more involved. I would recommend watching this movie at any time, it is very well paced and never gets boring, and if you have the time, watch T2 right after this."
"catalyst-7","9","224","295","4 March 2000"," It's about transformation
","I just saw a horrifying, touching, very good movie again; it's The Terminator.  Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman.  That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.<br/><br/>In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to ""get on your feet, soldier.""  She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous.  And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.<br/><br/>It's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me.  It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart.  It's quickly developing love story touches me.  Its humor makes the dark places in me smile.  But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation. As a good life exercise, ask yourself this: Would you have the courage to do what she does?<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10."
"Aidan McGuinness","Null","143","187","24 June 2002"," Compelling science fiction
","For the gift of `Aliens' and `The Terminator' I am willing to forgive Cameron's `Titanic'. The key plot concept is beautifully simple - machines take over the earth in the future. Machines are eventually over thrown by one man. Machines travel back in time to kill man's mother, thus preventing him being born and stopping their own defeat.  One human also travels back to stop the machines from killing his leader's mother.<br/><br/>`The Terminator' is a classic good versus evil struggle, with little in the way of greys clouding the issue. The terminator is an unstoppable brutal remorseless killer, and it perfectly suits Arnold Schwarzenegger's limited acting abilities. His few lines, including the infamous `I'll be back' are all well judged and timed, and give a great feeling of precision and inhumanity to his character. Coupled with his chiselled features, he's the best choice for the role. Michael Biehn is playing a character type that he'd reprise two years later in Cameron's `Aliens' - the human tough guy: he's got the fight, but still the ability to love and care for people. His features are well chosen for this and although his delivery of lines is hardly exceptional - they tend to come out in the same tone of voice - he's able to carry his part. Linda Hamilton is the woman-thrown-into-chaos, somewhat reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character in `Alien', although Hamilton doesn't have Weaver's strength of presence. All the actors are, for an action science fiction, above average and so never distract.<br/><br/>It's the script, with Cameron's force behind it that lifts the movie from mediocrity. Yes, there's a certain amount of corniness - the `we loved a life time' element for example - but the movie has a real sense of conviction present. The movie believes in itself and, through its passion, will make you believe too. There's a general sense of darkness in the movie - rarely do we see daylight, and, when we do, it's often the soft light of dawn. There's a nice sense of tension in the action scenes, helped not only by Cameron's camera work but also by an excellent electronic score (including a fantastic brooding credit sequence). Sure some of the SFX look clunky in these days of `Attack of the Clones' and `The Fellowship of the Ring', but they still work. There's a certain sense of inevitability, intertwined with hope, permeating the picture that creates a mood I particularly enjoyed and that's harder to find in the current crop of science fiction movies.<br/><br/>`The Terminator' is not a perfect picture. The movie lags in some parts, and the romance element is fairly contrived. Despite all that the movie brims with energy and promise, a script that mostly delivers, characters you can enjoy, and the ultimate Arnie role. Well worth catching. 8/10."
"MR_Heraclius","10","41","50","6 March 2020"," A fantastic SC-FI action thriller!
","""The Terminator"" is an incredible and fun Action/Sci-Fi movie of 1984. ""The Terminator's"" plot is that a cyborg a.k.a. ""The Terminator"" portrayed by ""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" time travels from 2029 back to 1984 to murder ""Sarah Connor"" portrayed by ""Linda Hamilton"". A savior named ""Kyle Reece"" portrayed by ""Michael Biehn"" also time travels back to 1984 to save ""Sarah Connor"". The plot is simple yet incredible. There is neither plot holes nor unanswered questions after watching ""The Terminator"". The acting in this movie is perfect ""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" was born to play the role of ""The Terminator"". And the one-liner that was repeated over and over again ""I'll be back"". ""Michael Biehn"" was amazing playing the role of ""Kyle Reece"". The music in this movie is thrilling to listen to; the climax of the film is incredible thanks to the stunning music composed by ""Brad Fiedel"". ""James Cameron"" did an amazing job at directing this movie, and he was great at filming the movie, there are one or two scenes that could've been shot better but only one or two. The special effects in this movie are superb for 1984 for example the scene where the terminator drives the car into the police station. There is one scene that is very bad, this is the scene where the terminator's eye is damaged and he cuts he eye out this scene is bad. If you are a person who enjoys 1980's Sci-Fi/Action films then you should definitely watch ""The Terminator"" as it is an exciting and incredible movie. The only issues are the eyeball cutting out scene, one or two scenes shot better and the dialogue been a little less of it repeating itself. I give ""The Terminator"" a 10/10."
"PeachHamBeach","10","64","85","19 April 2003"," Review of the Special Edition DVD
","I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the ""terminated"" scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other ""terminated"" scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her ""wholesome waitress"" routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd ""never"" had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful."
"behamut","10","11","12","22 September 1998"," Awesome
","The Terminator, created after another one of James Cameron's reaccuring dreams (Abyss was another one.)  A true beginning in sci-fi movies.  As Schwarzenegger said to his friend when he was picked to play the part as the Terminator, ""they want me to play as some robot from the future in this weird sci-fi movie."" His friend said, ""take it."" Schwarzenegger is perfect as the Terminator, merciless, no fear, no love, no pity, no remorse, no emotions.  None could have pulled it off as well as he did.  Even his eyes showed no emotion with still showing true evil. Michael Beign is just the opposite.  A man sent from the future to stop this machine.  He plays his part as perfect as Schwarzenegger plays his.  A perfect cast of characters for an all star movie! Plenty of action, story line, plot, character interaction, love story, and romance.  Everything is tied into this movie that possibly could be, making it a 3 star movie.  Only drawback is it's a little dragged out at parts and gets slightly boring from time to time but it's so minor that one would have to think about it to care. A truly awesome movie."

"springsunnywinter","10","24","30","21 August 2007"," The best of the best movies ever on the planet, galaxy & the entire universe
","The Terminator simply has to be my number 1 favourite movie of all time. When the first time I saw the film I fell in love with it about 15 years ago. The truly original idea of the story-line is amazing about a cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor, a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector - Kyle Reese - also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah. The movie was emotionally & psychologically thrilling and made so dark & sinister that give the tensive mood for the film. A well made for 80's film and I was surprised when I heard that it made with a budget of $6.4 million because it looks more expensive e.g. the nuclear war in Los Angeles 2029. I loved every second of it and the best scenes are:<br/><br/>1. When the terminator killed Ginger & her boyfriend.<br/><br/>2. Shootout at the nightclub (A classic scene in film history).<br/><br/>3. Self surgery on his wrist & eye.<br/><br/>4. Shootout at the police station.<br/><br/>5. When the terminator was driving the lorry.<br/><br/>6. When he unexpectedly rose from the fire as an endoskeleton after that it was a nail biting experience to the end.<br/><br/>The line ""I'll be back"" is simply the best quote for any film because the audience never expected his position of coming back. Although it is on the IMDb top 250 but it should have been No 1 top place because I have never seen a better movie than this. I've seen it about 100 times and I'm still not fed up. The Terminator gave me the passion about films and my verdict is 1000, 000/10. It's nearly about 25 years old and people still watch it. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London, Gremlins, A Nightmare in Elm Street & Predator, the list is endless. Anyway no matter whatever happens there will never be a better film than The Terminator."
"Movie Nuttball","10","25","33","23 November 2003"," The Terminator is one of the greatest films ever!
","This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time.<br/><br/>This is the one that started it all! Arnold is excellent in it! Linda Hamilton was great! Michael Biehn was very good as the good guy! Paul Winfield was good! Lance Hendrickson played a different character! In their short roles Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were cool! Look for Dick Miller! The acting by the cast is very good! The action scenes are very exciting with lots of gun fire and the special effects are awesome! The music is great! Out of the three Terminator films it is hard to decide which is the best but this one is damn good! In fact its one of the best movies ever! I strongly recommend anyone who loves Arnold and the other cast members I mentioned and especially if you love action, sci-fi, or even horror movies to not rent but buy this classic! I recommend The Terminator!<br/><br/>Movie Nuttball's NOTES:<br/><br/>There is one scene that I really like in the Terminator! It is when Sarah Connor is at the dance club. What I love about it is the song and the excellent slow motion camera. Its when Sarah drops something, she goes to pick it up and while she is bending over The Terminator comes walking through the dance floor! Its a classic moment!<br/><br/>Bill Paxton has been a part of three huge franchises! Being The Terminator as The Punk Leader, Aliens as Pvt. W. Hudson, and Predator 2 as Jerry Lambert! Lance Hendrickson has had a similar way of being in epics like Paxton being in The Terminator as Detective Vukovich, in Aliens as Bishop, Alien 3 as Bishop II, and as Charles Weyland in the upcoming 2004 movie Alien vs. Predator! Hendrickson, believe it or not was the original choice to play The Terminator! It is so amazing about this!<br/><br/>By Paxton and Hendrickson being in these films and that Alien Vs. Predator is finally going to invade the theaters in 2004 could it be that this has happened for a reason? The reason possibly being this: In the great Dark Horse comic books there are many editions of Alien Vs. Predator and a edition of Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator! What I am saying is could this mean that Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator will be made into a huge motion picture or a Alien vs. The Terminator or even a Predator vs. The Terminator movie in the future? Its just a thought but what if? I am sure some writers and/or directors have talked about these subjects! I am also sure big fans of these films and of The Terminator would love to watch these icons battle it out!"
"gigan-92","10","14","17","3 January 2011"," Bold, Gritty, and Realistic
","The 1984 classic, an astounding production. One of Cameron's early works, and yet one of his best. The ultimate thing that puts this film on a whole another level above so many other flops is the awesome blend of realism and atmosphere. When I first saw it as a kid, it just felt so real to me. And now, ten years later,t that feeling hasn't left me. Using his camera in a way only he can do, Cameron instills a sense of dread in every scene, something good old Arnold did quite well.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also did extraordinarily so, just putting the right amount of emotional touches to their performances. Its an involving film throughout that never fails to hit hard, even in light of some terrible and CGI loaded sequels. And who could forget the score, which only added to the already excellent tension. My favorite scene? No doubt, in a disturbing way, the scene where the T-101 is repairing itself, and the lighting is just so perfect gives off a feeling of absolute fear. Or perhaps the scene in the club where Reese first engages the Terminator, either way ingenious and unforgettable moments in film history.<br/><br/>A classic in every way."

The bad guy is bad, there's no mercy in there. Like many Cameron films, the dialogue brings out real characters, and the relationship between the Sarah and kyle feels genuine. The way the film unfolds is constantly gripping. The soundtrack really emphasises the desperate struggle.<br/><br/>And most of all the whole movie does justice to the plot, and the plot is absolutely watertight. Like the best science fiction films, it leaves you thinking about it, it leaves you agog at the possibility of it, and it doesn't have any holes - the downfall of Terminator 2 in my opinion, which doesn't make any sense from a plot point of view given Terminator.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 - the effects may date but they don't make a movie.

","Raise your hand if you've seen The Terminator.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>So, people of Earth, how many of you recall the last time you caught Arnold's breakout performance?<br/><br/>Who were you with? Were you conveyed by carriage or dirigible?<br/><br/>Put your hand down if you can't remember.<br/><br/>I only ask because revisiting's worthwhile.<br/><br/>This was my first time watching the movie, so my Dad and I instant-streamed T1 via Netflix. And it's glorious, lemme tell ya.<br/><br/>Soon as Arnold starts killing innocent people, my Dad says, ""I don't remember him being the bad guy.""<br/><br/>We realize he's never seen the first installment before. He only thinks he remembers. And I bet that's the case for many folks not raising their hand.<br/><br/>It's been thirty years since release, but it holds up like you wouldn't believe.<br/><br/>Seriously. The Terminator's a smart movie.<br/><br/>Every character is watertight. Prominent or minor the acting's often what retains the captivation in between gunplay and chase scenes.<br/><br/>The cops are Traxler and Vukovich, played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen (a.k.a. Bishop from Aliens), and have a humorous dynamic. Sarah's roommate, Bess Motta as Ginger, is the sexy bouncy type, and her boyfriend's a well-meaning dummy. Kyle Reese (played by Michael Biehn) is withdrawn and serious.<br/><br/>How about Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor? She's such an ass-kicking delight, her likeness is still utilized twenty-four years later in Fox's Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The show ran for two seasons and stars the pinnacle of underrated actresses, Lena Headey.<br/><br/>Talk about a crowning accolade for Hamilton's performance.<br/><br/>As a standalone, the story is very good and there's almost no need for a sequel. Although the ending lends itself to continuation, it's not necessary.<br/><br/>The movie's greatest weakness is the same mistake made by other science fiction films like Escape from New York and Event Horizon; meaning a drastic underestimation in regards to the timeframe. The scenes that take place in the future are supposed to be set in 2029. I don't think laser ammunition, synthetic skin cells and advanced artificial intelligence are around the corner.<br/><br/>Oh. And there's time travel.<br/><br/>But this is a silly topic of discussion, because the plot's 'self-contained'; the rules allotted to the story's universe are adequate enough. An artificial intelligence develops in 1997 that learns at an exponential rate, making allowances for the suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>The irony is, the film unfolds a lot like a horror movie.<br/><br/>For now, all I'll say is that The Terminator is a classic must-see film in the same manner The Great Gatsby's a must-read novel.<br/><br/>Those without a hand in the air should stop reading here, because the rest of the review will contain spoiler-heavy analysis.<br/><br/>Nuance abounds in this movie, and it's illustrative of the intelligence packed into every detail. Much of what occurs resonates thematically with the overall narrative.<br/><br/>For example, the recording on the girls' answering machine states, ""machines need love to,"" which obviously foreshadows Sarah's eventual encounter with the Terminator. It's also ironically commenting on the relationship between man and machine, and the eventual fate of humanity.<br/><br/>Another detail akin to this is the name of the club where the Terminator finally locates Sarah. The name is Tech-Noir; which is a touch of self-referential humor. The filmmaking resonates with noir themes, and the subject matter's heavily rooted in science fiction.<br/><br/>It's self-contained because of the limits established by the timeframe. In 1984, a Terminator would indeed have to look through the phone book for every 'Sarah Connor' and kill them off to ensure its mission's accomplished. It also establishes conceivable distance between the protagonist and the pursuing threat.<br/><br/>The audience can accept humanity's resistance to obliteration against seemingly insurmountable odds when considering ideas like utilizing dogs to detect terminators.<br/><br/>As for the special effects, most hold up quite nicely. And there shouldn't be any problem for a sophisticated viewer, given the context in which it's made. There is obvious use of green screen on set, and some devolved CGI, but for the most part everything's on the up-and-up.<br/><br/>Okay, let's dive in.<br/><br/>Timeline A is the history Reese returns from, which includes all events up until 2029. Timeline B is the realm in which the film unfolds, Earth in 1984.<br/><br/>Presumably, the John Connor of Timeline A didn't descend from Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor, right? A terminator didn't arrive in Timeframe A's 1984 to attempt the same assassination?<br/><br/>I'm assuming Timeframe A becomes separate from reality and Timeframe B will continue to unfold into an altered future.<br/><br/>There appears to be no residual effects from the changing of history yet. No chaos or collapse; which is nice.<br/><br/>I wonder if the sequel will cover the issue of reconnecting the loop; specifically, when history B reaches 2029, even if there's no such thing as terminators, will Reese have to travel back in time to impregnate Sarah again?<br/><br/>Anyway, the reason I say it unfolds like a horror movie is the impending doom that's constant throughout. Sarah encounters terrifying scrapes with death around every turn. Consider the odds constantly stacked against her.<br/><br/>After escaping the police station and literally everyone dies, Reese blasts the membrane off the Terminator's metal skeleton and dies to blow its legs off.<br/><br/>Yet its torso continues to crawl after Sarah and is only crushed by the pneumatic press as his fingers claw at her face.<br/><br/>The protagonist's terror is stretched to the utter limit, time and time again.<br/><br/>For those of you still holding an arm in the air, feel free to lower it now.<br/><br/>If nothing else you burnt some calories today, and learned two things about yourself.<br/><br/>1. You're easily manipulated. And 2. You have exquisite taste in movie reviews."

","The police psychologist interviewing Kyle Reese says it just right at one point: ""I could make a career out of this guy!"" Make that two careers, that of action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger and blockbuster filmmaker James Cameron.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a struggling waitress who has just been stood up for a date. Another date is en route; unfortunately for her it's the proverbial date from hell. He may look like a studly Austrian-American bodybuilder, but he's really a hyperalloy metal chassis wrapped in human tissue sent from the future to kill her before she can give birth to the hope of mankind's survival. Can Kyle (Michael Biehn) save her before Arnold does his job?<br/><br/>The title character is really a thing of beauty. As Kyle explains: ""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever! Until you are dead.""<br/><br/>So what you have is ""Jaws"" for a new decade. And there can be no doubt what that decade is. From the Walkman worn by Sarah's roommate to the trendy neon sportswear on display at the ""Technoir"" nightclub, this is a 1980s movie through and through. And other than some clunky miniatures work set in the world Kyle came from, there's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>The film has a lot more going for it. From start to stop this is, like ""Jaws,"" a pop-action spectacular that never stops. Even the lengthy time-travel exposition scenes are suspenseful, because you are always alert for what might come through the door in the next second. Schwarzenegger makes his most lasting impression in an atypical bad- guy role, while Hamilton convinces with her ruffled beauty and sudden bursts of heroism. Biehn may do the best job, his face suggesting the anguish of his character's plight as well as his somewhat crazy hope for the future personified in Sarah.<br/><br/>Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd fashioned a clever script with many brilliant touches that reward re-viewings. There's a scene between Kyle and Sarah that brings ""Terminator's"" greatness into focus for me. He's telling her of this photograph he has been holding of her, and spent many terrible nights staring at, wondering what she was thinking. Later, Cameron has a scene where we get to see what Sarah was thinking, and it's a doozy!<br/><br/>Then there's the police vehicle the Terminator rides around in trying to get his mark. The slogan on the side of the car reads: ""Dedicated To Serve."" Perfect!<br/><br/>Is the Terminator supposed to be from THE future, or just ""one possible future""? Like Sarah says, a guy could go crazy thinking about this. Or at least have to wait until the next sequel. Hollywood can beat good ideas to death, but this film proves it will take a lot indeed to kill the Terminator."
"Egg_MacGuffin","10","16","22","25 March 2005"," Greatest sci-fi/action movie ever?
","I don't know if The Terminator is the best sci-fi/action film ever made by anyone, but if it's not...then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie several dozen times since the age of 4, and it just gets better every time. It does have a special place in my heart, so I'll try and be as objective as possible in my review.<br/><br/>The plot is not as complicated as it seems. A man from the future is sent to 1984 Los Angeles to protect the mother of the unborn man who will lead the human race in resistance to the machines, who have also sent back a ""terminator"" to kill this woman, named Sarah Conner.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. We first see the terminator come back, kill some punks (Bill Paxon is one of them!) rob a gun store, and proceed to kill everyone in the phone book who has the name Sarah Conner. In the meantime, the man is sent back, chased by the police, steals a shotgun and some homeless guy's clothes, and then looks for Sarah Conner. And when we first see Sarah, she is a fumbling waitress...not ""the mother of the future"".<br/><br/>When the terminator, the man (named Kyle Reese), and Sarah Conner all come together, we are treated to one of the paramount action scenes of all time. All three people in the same location and the slow-motion and cheesy 80's music starts up. At this point, anyone who is watching the movie for the first time has no idea who's on who's side. Then the terminator targets Sarah and Kyle interrupts the slow motion with gunfire. After that is a short but effective shoot-out (Uzi 9mm absolutely MUST be used in every 80's action movie), then a vehicle chase while Kyle lays down the exposition.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie so effective is the antagonist...the terminator. He is shot several times, thrown through a window, hit by a car...and he keeps on going. And I'm sure everyone (even some who have not see the movie) knows the famous line ""I'll be back"", which is said just before the terminator ""visits the police station"", if you know what I mean. At this point, Sarah and Kyle are at the police station, so they're safe, right? ""There's thirty cops in this building"", so they must be safe. Wrong. Five minutes later, everyone is dead and the building is burning to the ground...and the terminator keeps on going.<br/><br/>James Cameron's directing is outstanding, especially considering the $6,400,000 budget and the primitive yet effective special effects, which deserve special mention. The effects in this movie are, in parts, better than anything that can be done by today's cgi. Sure, there's many parts which are out-dated as hell, but there's still certain effects that look real enough to believe. The gas truck exploding at the end was a miniature actually exploding, not some fake cgi crap done on a computer. The metal terminator skeleton at the end is real, not a cgi effect (but the stop-motion scenes look AWFUL).<br/><br/>Considering the budget in relation to what was accomplished in this film, it's truly a remarkable effort that could probably not have been pulled off by anybody other than James Cameron. Add a script that is commonly used as a teaching tool for upcoming screenwriters and you have a spectacular film.<br/><br/>The only bad thing about this movie is that after watching it today, it makes you sad that nobody working today can make anything as good."

","I don't like action movies generally, and had to be coaxed into seeing this one by a friend.  It was a major and pleasant surprise to me, and I left it with questions beyond the scope of the film, which always happens with the ones I really like (ie, Did John know who Reese was/would be when he sent him?).  Most of all, I left it a Michael Biehn fan; he is great in this movie."

","A great science-fiction film with a compelling story. James Cameron does a good job interweaving a science-fiction narrative with other elements. The movie is considered an independent film with a low budget, but it feels much more than that. The animation for the time is actually done quite well, especially for being a low budgeted film. Linda Hamilton does a great job in the film. She doesn't over act her lines and the end of the film I felt she really outshone in the factory and leaving John her message. Michael Biehn also does a great performance and Arnold Schwarzenegger does a good job, he may of had very few lines but his physical acting is very well done. Schwarzenegger did a good job at portraying a cyborg with use of movements. The dream sequences in the film that go back and forth between the future and the present is amazing, gives it more of a chilling sense knowing that their future is full of hardship and turmoil. Overall this film is amazing and for being 30 years old, is still going to stand the test of time."

","Here's another film from the '80s that is reaching ""classic"" status. Unlike some of the other popular movies of its day, this one had two sequels that both were successful, particularly the second. In retrospect, what makes this ""Terminator"" different is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain, not the hero, as he was in the other Terminator movies.<br/><br/>Here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the ""good guys."" The now famous phrase by Arnold, ""I'll be back."" comes from this film. Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.<br/><br/>Played mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains."

If there is an actor who is less appreciated for his work, then i don't know as much about cinema as I thought. He is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors of all time, but he hits a peak in James Cameron's 1984 film ""The Terminator"". From the moment when he first steals that tramp's pants to his heroic death, he acts with a degree of intensity and skill that is rarely seen in film today. True, the rest of the cast are fantastic, and the script and direction are basically perfect, but for me the highlight of this film will always be Michael Biehn. I do think that The Terminator is one of my favourite films, and one i never tire of watching. its f***ing amazing!"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>After a few films, you get to know a director's mind. Sometimes that mind is broken or limited in ways that has the serendipitous effect of creating work that the public embraces.<br/><br/>Vincent Van Gogh is one of my icons for this phenomenon, a deeply disturbed man with vast limitations on his vision but one major crack (and a few minor ones)into a whole new world. It doesn't matter whether the artist understands this, though Vincent did and wrote eloquently on it. Either way, when the public embraces such stuff, the world changes. It shifts center to the new way and sometimes seals off the areas the artist never saw. So sometimes, effective art damages us.<br/><br/>Cameron is a force in film, possibly as damaging in his way as Speilberg, but with far fewer and less varied films. What he sees and can display must be attractive to judge from the receipts. What he cannot see is less obvious. Here is his first real film, his `Rocky.'<br/><br/>In my comment on `Aliens,' I noted the radically differing styles of Cameron and the man who invented the sexual, scifi horror genre. Cameron starts with the stunts, adds humor and then finds places for the actors and situations. Most work the other way around. Scott starts with a general vision first; for him, stunts are merely punctuation of the visual space. But Cameron starts with a mechanical skeleton, not at all unlike that shown here.<br/><br/>And then his strategy is to be relentless in eliminating the human elements of the film: those elements like character development, richness of situation, emotional space. He crushes them just like Arnie's cybergoon, because they simply mess up the cleanliness of his movie. Such `soft' stuff is for wimps. Any sort of irony or annotation is for eggheads and who needs em.<br/><br/>In the roughly 20 years since this was made, the film world has changed radically with much energy attracted to the Cameron model. The machines in Hollywood are winning. Four years later, `Die Hard' introduced a simple sort of self-effacing irony into the model and until now that is the only human remnant remaining. It is hidden, and the hardcore action guys often poke fun at it (see `XXX' vs `Men in Black 2'). And more, now life further imitates art with Arnie planning run for political office!<br/><br/>The point is, folks that watching film can be great fun even if the films themselves are poor. All you need to do is place it in the context of the people who made it, and who thereby partly make us. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."

","The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present.<br/><br/>Tonight...<br/><br/>With those words, the legend was born.<br/><br/>Then the words fade. There are bright flashes. Out of the smoke rises what looks like a human being. But this is no normal human. Before long he yanks the heart out of a punk who refuses to give him his clothes. He feels no pain, no fear, no pity or remorse. He exists for one purpose only. He is THE TERMINATOR.<br/><br/>A few miles away there are more flashes. From the smoke emerges Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a human warrior from the future sent to stop the Terminator from accomplishing his mission. <br/><br/>What is his mission? For forty minutes we are left in suspense, until the full story is told. In the future, an artificial intelligence is facing imminent defeat at the hands the humans, who it nearly drove to extinction. In a last ditch move, it sent the Terminator back to the year 1984.<br/><br/>Its Mission: Kill the future mother of John Connor, the leader of the human resistance. Wipe out his existence entirely so there will be no resistance.<br/><br/>Her name is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She is not rich, nor a genius. ""I can't even balance my checkbook!"" she says, ""Do I look like the mother of the future?"" But she is. And she is in great danger. Reese has to protect her at all costs, but he could not bring any weapons through the time warp. Nothing dead will travel back through time. How can you stop something that is indestructible?<br/><br/>That, my friends, is the crux of what makes this so great. Bits and pieces of information about the future of mankind are dropped in the film's first half. Eventually we can piece them together. Director James Cameron helps us out with flashbacks, as we see the horrifying battleground of 2029 through the eyes of Kyle Reese.<br/><br/>Once the exposition is done, the story refocuses on the troubles presently facing Connor and Reese. They can only hide so long before the tenacious machine tracks them down...and kills them.<br/><br/>The main element, besides the story, which makes the movie so effective is the way it is directed. Cameron is one of the most gifted directors in the industry, that much is certain, and one of his fortes is pacing. He also co-wrote the script, allowing him to mold the step-by-step action to his directing. The result is a tight, gripping atmosphere with air of mystery and horror mixed in. The story is sound, and builds carefully, with the audience staying involved for both the exposition and the action. There is never a dull moment.<br/><br/>The special effects are not very good, even for that day. The visions of the future are not too slick, and most shots of the Terminator's metal structure look fake at best. Still, Cameron finds a way to give his imagery impact and depth. The musical score is percussion heavy and synthesized, but what makes it work so well is that it's tenacious, subtly embodying the personality of the title character.<br/><br/>As for the acting...well, Cameron is a great director there, too. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the Terminator. His most haunting quality is the straight face he keeps while slaughtering anyone who stands in his way. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are wholly convincing, making us feel for their plight. The always likable Paul Winfield also gets in on the act as a police lieutenant.<br/><br/>In the end, this is Cameron's movie to win or lose, and he uses all of skills to the fullest. Despite its shortcomings, ""The Terminator"" is a winner. Perhaps I can finally forgive Cameron for ""Titanic."""

","The sequel to The Terminator was brilliant, don't get me wrong, but I still think the original movie was slightly better. Both were great movies, yet different in their own ways. The Terminator felt like it had a more darker tone to it, and that's something I liked compared to the sequel. What I liked about The Terminator was the plot - very interesting to follow especially when Sarah first hears about her unborn son. Either way, I think this movie is a great set-up for what is to come afterwards. Arnold Schwarzenegger was great in this movie, and it's rare to see that he doesn't play the hero for a change; in fact, he was actually very scary as the ""Terminator"". I consider it one of his best movies out there."

","Before The Terminator, James Cameron wasn't to well known as he had previously done Piranha 2: The Spawning, which received negative reviews from critics and audiences. But that led him to The Terminator, it started off as he was having a dream about being chased by a killer cyborg while he was on directing the Piranha sequel although he'd been bed ridden because he got sick from the food poisoning. Arnold Schwarzenegger was known as a body builder not really an actor. Originally Schwarzenegger wanted to play Kyle Reese the man sent from the future to protect Sarah Conner. But it ultimately went to Michael Biehn. This is for the best as Schwarzenegger's terminated is known now to be one of the best movie villain's of all times. James Cameron originally plan was to only have one movie but the success critically and commercially led to four sequels (one of which he directs). The visual effect's for the movie are amazing as for the time of the initial release no one had ever seen anything like it making James Cameron a legitimate filmmaker in Hollywood. The acting is strong and is easy to follow, the ending of the movie is what you wouldn't expect leaving you with hope. If you thought this is another low-budget crappy sci-fi thriller you'd be wrong as this movie launched James Cameron's career, Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton's and with Bill Paxton's cameo. With James Cameron's direction the film is what it is today a classic that never get's old."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","3","3","8 March 2016"," Classic horror/thriller/action hybrid
","A classic Blockbuster, The Terminator plays more like a horror film than the action film franchise that it spawned. Schwarzenegger owns the whole movie with his minimal dialogue and enormous presence. Its amazing that with only fourteen lines of dialogue he became one of the most quotable characters of all time. He carries all of his weapons like extensions of his own arms and remains completely deadpan at all times. <br/><br/>The acting of the movie is carried by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, both of whom do an excellent job of their roles. Hamilton is a sweet but scared young woman on the run from something she doesn't understand. Biehn is a young soldier from a time far from now, with PTSD licking at the edges of his consciousness. The way Reese looks at heavy machines with apprehension is a tiny thing that speaks volumes, as is the non-existent reactions to deaths of his fellow soldiers in present day. <br/><br/>Cameron's screenplay is a marvel, full of incredible dialogue and one of the best plot twists in cinema history. Whilst most of the visual effects are quite dated, they far from ruin the movie and the animatronic head of Schwarzenegger is certainly impressive for its time. The way Cameron cuts the movie around R-rated violence and unavailable visual effects (putting sunglasses on, brilliant!) actually contributes to the film's cult thriller status. I don't know why Schwarzenegger was given a posh combover at the start, but it is quickly messed up, and the film's score has lots of impressive horror moments but is probably better suited to this film than the very action-heavy Terminator theme we are used to today."

","Being a pre-teen back in 1984, it was inevitable not to get familiar with all the action movies of the 1980's. And the 1984 ""The Terminator"" starring none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger definitely was one of the biggest action movies of the mid-Eighties.<br/><br/>I am very sure that everyone is familiar with the ""Terminator"" franchise and the plans of Skynet. But for those of you not yet familiar with the franchise, this 1984 movie, which started it all, is about a cyborg (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent from 2029 back in time to 1984 where his mission is to terminate Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines. But the humans of 2029 has managed to send back a single soldier (played by Michael Biehn) to prevent this from happening.<br/><br/>There, essentially the entire story wrapped up with a handful of words. Despite its simplicity, then there are layers underneath the storyline which adds lots of flavor and detail to the story and the universe of the ""Terminator"" franchise. Things which will come to be realized and utilized in the later movies.<br/><br/>For a 1984 action movie then ""The Terminator"" was just off the charts. It had great special effects, heaps of non-stop action, and best of all it had Schwarzenegger. It has all the ingredients that a good action movie need in order to be successful. And you must agree that the ""Terminator"" franchise has been successful throughout the years since 1984.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron does what he does best here, and that is putting together a riveting action movie that grabs the audience by the you-know-whats and doesn't let go before the end credits start rolling. James Cameron really has a talent for memorable action movies.<br/><br/>The cast in ""The Terminator"" also really had a lot of credit due for the success of the movie. Anything that Arnold Schwarzenegger touched in the mid-Eighties was bound to be an action success. And alongside him in this 1984 movie stood Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, both of whom put on equally good performances and held the level of Schwarzenegger formidably.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" is one of those types of action movies that never grow old. Sure certain effects are hopelessly outdated by what Hollywood dish out today, but they were really great back in 1984. And the effects do serve their purpose well enough, especially given that this movie is driven by a mixture of story, character and effects.<br/><br/>Lots of action and lots of one-liners, ""The Terminator"" is an entertaining movie that is well-worth spending 107 minutes on watching."
"jscherber","9","3","3","16 January 2016"," Great action/science fiction story
","The Terminator follows a woman named Sarah Connor and two mysterious men who both appear naked in nighttime Los Angeles 1984 who both seem to be looking for her. One of them even seems to want to kill her and ruthlessly kills two other Los Angeles women named Sarah Connor. The movie is pretty well directed with the tone being ominous at the beginning and more exciting as the story moves on. The mystery element is what makes it work in the first half, with us having no idea who these men are and why they are looking for her. There turns out to be an interesting revelation for it and a cool sci-fi paradox at the end. The action scenes are exciting, but it would have been better to have it more science fiction and less action as we only see a small part of the film focusing on the future. The climax is also very exciting and well done. The acting is good but the main character is not very interesting or likable, just your average woman. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays his character perfectly as an unstoppable emotionless freak, which is the strongest part of the movie. This film would be good for sci-fi fans but even more for action fans."

I like the way to show that the strange man is very strong. He is in good shape, and also doesn't smile at all. Arnold Schwarzenegger played the part of the strong man. He makes the man more thrilling by his appearance. However, the content is a little bit complicated for me, especially, the relationships among people.

"ElMaruecan82","9","3","3","14 July 2015"," Fatality and Predestination or when running away can only be a temporary option
","Simply said, ""The Terminator"" is a great film, and even greater when you watch it with the mindset of someone discovering it in 1984, a time when Arnold Schwarzenegger's career was still to be consolidated, when James Cameron wasn't yet that billion-ma'King of the world', when ""I'll be back"" was still a quote that could be heard in any film without being associated to a bad-ass catchphrase with an Austrian accent, when Linda Hamilton still looked like a lovely doll begging for protective hugs.<br/><br/>In 1984, moviegoers went to see an entertaining B-movie starring that Conan-the-Barbarian-guy whose speech pattern could hardly be taken seriously. Even the producers and director expected a backslash from the critics. Little did they know that they had just made a milestone almost as significant for the Sci-fi genre as ""Alien"" five years before, and that their humility would be rewarded by a close-to-unanimous praise and a lightning propulsion into Pop- Culture. Arnie became THE ultimate action-movie icon, and the rest is no less legendary.<br/><br/>And the reason the film works is its remarkable simplicity in each aspect. First of all, the plot : an Artificial Intelligence company named Skynet created such technologically advanced robots that they rebelled against humans and provoked a nuclear holocaust until they were almost defeated by the Rebel Chief John Connor. As a robot sent to kill his mother before he'd exist, Schwarzenegger appears at night, completely naked and takes some civilian clothes before tracking Sarah Connor. But we're in a basic Sci-fi movie and the villain calls for a hero, this is where Michael Biehn intervenes, he looks strong but he's not the alpha male muscular type, which eases the empathy process.<br/><br/>His mission is to protect Sarah Connor and kill the Terminator, so running away can only be a temporary option. Yet if the villain ever inspires one thing, it is not to confront him. The Terminator doesn't know what Sarah Connor looks like, but that's not an issue, any Sarah Connor can potentially be John's mother and is terminated Skynet-style. The murders are straightforward and chilling. At first, the Police don't notice anything odd with that brutal murder, until a second Sarah Connor is gunned down. What kind of serial killer works by the name? Anyway, the most urgent is to protect any Sarah Connor living in L.A., including an adorable waitress, so far from that girl-power archetype from the sequel.<br/><br/>And this is one of the film's beauties, the absolute contrast between the robotic killer and the harmless target. And this is where the casting pays off; Arnold Schwarzenegger was certainly criticized for the limitations of his acting range, especially at a time where his accent was stronger, but here, he's given a role that only an actor like him could have portrayed perfectly: a cold and implacable killing machine. The Terminator was nominated #22 villain in the American Film Institute, but he's not sadistic, nor vicious, he's just programmed that way, which is why he's so scary. He's like a steamroller of brutality that will ignore every obstacle until it gets him to Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>And the film wouldn't have worked had Linda Hamilton looked or played it like Ellen Ripley in ""Alien"", Obviously, a woman like Sarah Connor needs a protection whether from the cops or from Biehn, and some bits of luck that will prevent her from the fatal encounter. Indeed, when the Terminator realizes he didn't kill the right woman although she lived in Sarah's house, begins a breathtaking, spellbinding cat-and-mouse chase. There are shootouts, there are car chases, but they felt different because this time, the enemy doesn't try to get at them but to kill them, they're means as well as ends. The Terminator is an unstoppable death warrant, guided by fatality. Notice the scene when, for once, Sarah gets the illusion of being finally protected, in a commissariat. The Terminator's ""I'll be back"", especially when heard for the first time, sums up everything, no matter how far away you try to push him, he'll get back to you.<br/><br/>And this, resonates as the voice of fatality, the omen of an inevitable confrontation, something that neither Biehn nor Sarah can't avoid, the future has come to haunt them, and if Sarah is really the mother of a future fighter, even she will have to express that 'fighting' part of herself. Whether you look at the half-empty or half-full glass, you'll see ""Terminator"" as a predestination or fatality movie. And I guess this is why the appellation neo-noir isn't gratuitous. Noir is about people who try to escape from a painful certainty but can only triumph over it by confronting it, at the cost of something precious such as their innocence, their optimism, their faith on life or humanity.<br/><br/>And 'The Terminator"" is mostly set at night, it features characters who hide from these robots that remind them the apocalyptic future they carry on their hands, their own responsibility. Of course, bonds ought to be made and we have some clues that the predestination thing will provide some curious loops that don't quite respect the orthodoxy of time travels. But the film isn't about time travels, it's about a sense of duty and responsibility. And in a way ""The Terminator"", as a villain, is an inspiration for the heroes, as much as he must kill them no mater what, they have to resist and to defeat him at any costs, the measure of a great antagonist is the degree to which he allows the heroes to overcome their weaknesses.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the whole trilogy invites humans to question their condition, from being masters to slaves of the technology, what you can control can control you, it's all up to us to take the control of our lives back. That's what Sarah Connor will do, and this is why she becomes such a great heroine, the perfect match for such a great villain."
"grintemcstinger","10","3","3","12 May 2015"," Visionary
","More than 30 years has passed since ""The Terminator"" has been released. Wow, how time flies by... Still, the movie remains one of the most fascinating pieces of cinema history. It may show its age in some parts, where it's ""so 80's"" and goofy you'll probably have to giggle or roll your eyes and Arnold delivers his few lines with an accent thicker than pudding, but beside these minor scenes, it has aged well and truly reminds me that they don't make them like that anymore. And if you haven't seen it - what are you waiting for? Stop reading anything about it, go grab yourself a copy, turn the lights down and the sound up and enjoy this visionary masterpiece.<br/><br/>Why do I say is it visionary? Because there hasn't quite been anything like it before, not at this level of production. Just the idea that a near indestructible cyborg is haunting you for seemingly no reason is nightmare inducing, fundamentally great movie material. Not only that, but how James Cameron is expanding on it is sheer brilliance. Of course, since it involves sci-fi babble which you may or may not find far-fetched there is a slight chance you'll find it's plot to be nonsense. Regardless even if you dismiss the story as something completely stupid there is still plenty of impressive action, stunt-work, car chase-thrills and tension to keep you entertained. But it's far from being just mindless action. It is dark, it doesn't scare away to show some nasty stuff such as the Terminator repairing himself with this flesh torn or him going on a spree at the police station all of which cleverly emphasizes what an unstoppable, ruthless force we're dealing here with. Speaking of the scene at the police station, it is probably one of the most spectacular shootout scenes ever. The non-stop sounds of gunfire, smart use of POV shots which at the time were something creative and not overused, clear camera angles and uncompromised outcome make it something truly special. And Arnolds performance in it is pure badassery. <br/><br/>The Terminator is one of those must-see movies. Even now where it's formula has already been copied countless times, I still can't appreciate it enough. It is a product of one of the greatest filmmaker of our time, which earned its success by pure passion for the material, imagination and vision, and it shows. Truly a masterpiece."

","This was one of those early movies that drew me in to the world of Hollywood. Of course, when I first watched it, I didn't have much idea about what went behind the scenes when making this movie. But now that I do, my respect for this movie has grown tremendously given what it was able to accomplish on such a low budget with such a small set of characters making what could have easily been a B-movie in the wrong hands seem like a solid sci-fi story ending with an epic feeling of the things to follow.<br/><br/>The movie begins with what is possibly one of the coolest title cards for a 1980s flick with Brad Fiedel's iconic Terminator theme playing in the background as the cast is listed in the form of messages displayed from a computer terminal. This is followed by the Terminator and the human making their appearances from the future into our present, gathering clothes and weapons and heading out in their own respective ways in the search for Sarah Connor, a teenage girl part-timing as a waitress upon whose survival rests humanity's future as both she and us learn later. What follows is a cat and mouse game where the human goes all out to protect her and the Terminator is all out to get her and it won't stop, literally right till the end.<br/><br/>What separates this movie (and its immediate sequel) from the ""other"" sequels is James Cameron's balancing act who, much like Spielberg, allows the story to take center-stage and drive everything else and has perfect control over the length of sequences, edits, camera cuts and angles. 10 minutes into the movie and you're in, drawn to this world, completely forgetting that the futuristic crafts and landscapes are miniatures with absolutely no chance of being drawn out of this world. While I didn't find the characters to be groundbreaking or as interesting as in other dramas, the plot was extremely well constructed and allowed for some really cool paradoxes that would make for some interesting discussion (would John Conner even exist if he hadn't sent Kyle back in time).<br/><br/>The effects deserve special mention too. It is incredible how much Stan Winston's crew and Fantasy II were able to achieve at the time. All the futuristic scenes, the sequence with the Terminator treating his injuries, the chase sequences and the entire ambitious final act all work and some of them still hold up three decades later. And Brad Fiedel's theme gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, as if signaling an impending apocalypse.<br/><br/>All the actors do well in their respective roles, particularly Arnold who shines in a part that seemed almost tailor made to suit his acting capabilities. But it is Cameron who is truly the star of this endeavor, believing in his project and driving it to execution. Thank God for the success of this movie, which gave us many more masterpieces by Cameron. But then, it was entirely deserving of it. A sci-fi tech-noir classic.<br/><br/>Overall Score: 8.0 / 10.0"

Soon a murderous cyborg the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - a remorseless, relentless bogeyman with a bone- crushing steel skeleton and a soul-piercing red diode glare - is sent back in time from the future to kill the mother of the as-yet- unborn leader of the human rebellion. Back in present-day Los Angeles, his mother – a timorous pushover waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) - is unaware of her role in the struggles to come, until the arrival of our titular terminator, whose only purpose is to kill her and thereby change the future. Her only hope is a bashful guerrilla fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who has followed the T-800 back through time to prevent her death and evade any and all attacks from the killer cyborg, while gradually forming a romance with her throughout the mission to preserve her life. Can the Terminator track Sarah down and change the course of the future?<br/><br/>The story is deceptively tricky: In comparison to today's packaged thrillers, this is a surprisingly vicious little film, filled with indiscriminate killings and a rough-edged feel that makes it utterly compelling. James Cameron's direction of the ensuing chaos is masterful, and the characterization of the violence has something agonizingly original about it. He manages to generate maximum excitement from the very first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. What really propels the movie, though, isn't the savagery but a well-written and taut screenplay with a nice eye for sharp detail that doesn't tend to drift off into the occasional ponderous bits. There's real heart and soul here, along with Arnold's best-ever performance - as a lumbering slab of dumb, destructive strength. Hamilton's performance as the bewildered waitress who will unwittingly become the savior of the human race is terrific. Biehn shines as Sarah's knight in shining armor.<br/><br/>The Terminator grabs us right away and carries us to the end with roller-coaster action sequences and clever time-travel twists. What it results in is arguably the best science fiction thriller of all time that throttles you with the air of a demented ballet."

","After hearing many times to watch terminator series and seeing good reviews finally saw all the terminator movies over the weekend. Being a big fan of sci-fi genre, must say this movie establishes another incredible sci-fi universe like alien,matrix,etc. even though last 2 movies were disappointing. Even if the effects looked very dated, still its a evergreen classic which will be remembered for a long time. The dreadful and menacing 'Terminator' played stylishly by Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his career defining roles. It feels like he was destined for the role. The Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel with the clanging metal matches the character of Terminator perfectly and is one of the best themes of all time alongside likes of Star Wars. James Cameron makes skillful use of low-budget effect with a wonderful story. I admired his work in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', but now I have realized his best work dates back in the 1980s-90s with the best film being 'Aliens'. <br/><br/>A mysterious looking man with no clothes on emerges out of nowhere in L.A. in 1984, he seems to be hunting a woman named Sarah Connor. Similarly another man also emerges who is also looking for the same woman. As it turns out this latter guy is there to protect the woman from the earlier mysterious guy who isn't actually a man but machine called 'Terminator' whose mission is to kill Sarah. Both are sent from a post-nuclear war future where man and machine are fighting, and the fate of Sarah is very important in the whole premise. Well the film kind of shows that the Discovery of Arnold's character is a Terminator a surprising moment as enough suspense gets built up. But since we are already told in the beginning that in future there man vs machine war, so I wouldn't consider it as spoiler. Also as soon as you have time-travel involved in Sci-fi movies the emergence of some paradox is imminent unless you draw line or stick with assumptions. The whole franchise is affected by it, but I feel its the least in The Terminator.<br/><br/>Keeping aside the time-travel the movie's spotlight is its horrific and suspenseful pursuit of Sarah by Terminator. Machines have no feelings like emotion or fear, thus the ruthless Terminator has become like a horror icon! Also there are scenes of the future earth where the nuclear war destruction and the terror of the machine ravaging the lives of humans.These make of think of the path the human race is headed. Brad Fiedel score makes the atmosphere even more scary. Here we have another blend scifi-horror like the 'Alien' and 'The Thing' only with more action. But what makes Terminator a classic on its own is its characters and story. Both Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were excellent. Without any doubt Arnold was bad- ass and the best. Also I got to enjoy the famous dialogues like 'I'll be Back' or 'Come with me if you want to live' which have become so iconic that all the terminator sequels use them so as to entertain the fans of this original film. The pacing is slightly slow but suspense keeps you engaged. Overall if you think of time it was released, it is a classic and breakthrough film in its genre. Despite not having great effects and me watching it at a time where sci-fi movies aren't that rare 'The Terminator' entertains a lot. It is because it has great story and splendid characters and acting. The thing many special-effect driven sci-fi movies miss nowadays. <br/><br/>RATING: [4.5/5]"
"The Grand Master","10","3","3","3 January 2015"," Where the legend began...
","Who would have thought a low budget science fiction movie aptly named The Terminator would become a successful movie as well as start the meteoric rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a legend in cinema, introduce director James Cameron to Hollywood as a force to be reckoned with, give a new meaning to audiences with the immortal line ""I'll be back"", spawn a large fan base, and then witness the birth of a big-budget saga with an even bigger sequel in 1991 that outdoes the first movie with Terminator 2: Judgement Day and then continue on with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003, Terminator Salvation in 2009, and Terminator Genisys in 2015 as well as a short lived TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger introduces us to his now iconic role as The Terminator, a cyborg disguised as a human being. The Terminator has been sent back in time from 2029 to Los Angeles in 1984 to terminate Sarah Connor in order to prevent the birth of her unborn child, John Connor, who would go on to lead the human resistance to victory against Skynet and the machines in the future following a nuclear war which almost wiped out most of the human race. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in a rare role as a villain, is perfect as the Terminator, a killing machine who is programmed to kill without any pity, remorse or fear in his single minded quest to terminate Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton in an early role introduces us to Sarah Connor, a timid and mousy waitress who's life will be changed forever upon the discovery her unborn son, John Connor, will become the future leader of the human resistance. She still does not believe that such an event will happen with the nuclear war and the rise of the machines, until her encounter with the Terminator and thus begins her quest to stay alive for the sake of her unborn son and to survive this real life nightmare.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn in one of his early roles plays Kyle Reese, a young, battle-hardened, and world-weary soldier who volunteered to be sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 by John Connor to protect his mother at all costs from the Terminator. Once Reese rescues Sarah, he warns her about the impending doom of the human race from the nuclear war and her future significance carried by her and her unborn son.<br/><br/>Keep an eye out for Bill Paxton in an early role as a street punk.<br/><br/>Though The Terminator is now 30 years old, it still stands the test of time as a positive influence on all science fiction and action movies since. Exciting, high energy action sequences which turns downtown Los Angeles into an urban battleground and leads to an even bigger chase to a climatic showdown keeps the dynamic tension in The Terminator very tight and does not let the audience go for one moment.<br/><br/>Taut and kinetic direction with a sharp eye for attention to detail from James Cameron keeps The Terminator as a gritty, clever, breathtaking, exciting and thrilling movie from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.<br/><br/>10/10."
"Rickting","9","3","3","17 December 2014"," Super strong sci-fi classic
","Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his most famous role, plays a brutal killing machine sent into the past to kill the mother of the resistance leader who leads the humans in the war against the machines in the future. A human soldier is sent back in time to protect her. Cue loads of sublime science fiction mayhem. The Terminator is inevitably dated due to the small budget, but it's a great time at the movies. It is a science fiction classic and completely deserves to be, thanks to the interesting story and strong action sequences. While it's a fast paced and snappy movie which hurtles along at breakneck speed, there's a moving relationship in the film and the elements of time travel give the story unexpected depth, which ensure the film certainly does not represent its iconic antagonist. Arnold Schwarzenegger dominates the screen in brilliant badass fashion and while he doesn't have many lines, he delivers them excellently and is an intimidating and threatening villain, although he's still not as cool as R2 D2 and C3PO.<br/><br/>The brilliantly made action ensures the film crackles with high octane thrills and genuine energy. There are too many chase sequences in the film, but at least they remain fun despite some repetition. It's overall a very well made film and delivers thrill after thrill. The runtime isn't overlong and it's easy to watch and enjoy. Acting is all around good and Sarah Connor, although she really became a cool character in the sequel, isn't your typical damsel in distress. Kyle Reese is also a very good character. In General, The Terminator is an iconic and entertaining movie which has surprising depth and plenty of fun action. It's not the best science fiction film ever and can't help but look slight next to its dream sequel, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, but mostly it's held up pretty well and even though the budget is relatively small the effects and surprisingly convincing. James Cameron's films can leave one cold, but he certainly knows how to turn millions of dollars into ultra cool cinematic art and put butts on seats.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Terminator"" (1984) is a true classic, and one of the most important movies ever created. By ""important"" I mean that it started lots of things, which later became very common in cinema itself.<br/><br/>There isn't anything new that I could write about this picture that was wasn't said hundred times before. Everything in this movie works and clicks on all cylinders. Made only for couple of bucks (in terms of today's sci-fi / ""actionier"" budget, even considering B movies) it stuck in people memories forever. How did maestro J. Cameron achieve that?<br/><br/>Here are the main reasons in my opinion: Original and high concept story; Very good and believable acting by all involved; Great script; Cool action scenes; Terrific pacing; and of course all cudos to all technical stuff, effects, cinematography and so on. The idea was always the driving force behind movie, which is now safe to call masterpiece. J. Cameron proofed his genius with his first movie (first movie I mean ""Terminator"", not flying fish stuff J).<br/><br/>Overall, as you have already saw this picture many times, there is nothing new to say. It's a true classic in every meaning of this word. Even now, 30 years after its release, this small budget B movie sci fi flick from 80's is still managing to attract audiences. If you could check some torrent sites, you would always see this film as one of the most down loadable, whenever you check it, no matter what season is, what movies there are – it's always among the most popular. It's simply just for one reason – a true movie entertainment is timeless and ageless."
"antagonist117","9","3","3","30 September 2014"," An icon of its time and for all time
","""The Terminator"" is two things that are very good to be: a movie that is of its time, and a movie for all time. From the opening minutes it is almost fetishistically contemporary. A superimposed text says the events of the film take place ""tonight,"" a rather hokey tactic, most often seen in the horror genre, that may create a sense of immediacy for some first-run viewers but that becomes increasingly ironic as time takes its toll on the fashion, the music, the hair, and so on. ""Terminator""'s first act is an onslaught of such tell-tale signs of the time, and the time in question is peak 1980s. This is not a bad thing. The movie so successfully captures the spirit of its era that later movies set in its milieu often appear to be, and in many cases undoubtedly are, copying it. It wasn't the first movie to take place in fume- and trash-filled urban alleys and neon-lit dance clubs, or to feature independent women who do things like have sex and ride motorcycles without prompting censure or even comment, but it was arguably the best and best-looking and most influential movie to do these things at this time. In other words, it is an icon of 1980s film.<br/><br/>It is also an icon of film generally. It accomplished that even grander feat through a combination of brilliant achievements. First, the casting, particularly of Arnold Schwarzenegger. His early acting career benefited enormously from the existence of roles that nobody else could have played quite as well. Conan the Barbarian was a near-Neanderthal: strong, serious, a mythic figure of great stature and few words. The Terminator is the same, though he kills for different reasons. Arnold is menacing, darkly funny, and extremely cool in the role, all at once. Second, the script. It serves timeless lines on a silver platter for Schwarzenegger and the other two leads, and they all three seem to know exactly what to do with them. They take soundbytes and throw them at us like sticks of dynamite, and when they land we feel them: ""Come with me if you want to live,"" ""I'll be back,"" and ""You're terminated, f*cker."" (The last one is another reminder that we're in the 1980s, a long-ago time when action and sci-fi movies were sometimes made for adults, not just teens. The language here is strong, the violence is not all bloodless, and the sex is very much on- screen.) Third, a time-travel plot that is unusually well thought out, capable of being communicated without too much belabored exposition, and that leaves plenty of room for further exploration without raising too many unanswered questions. It is strong conceptual ground on which to build a media empire.<br/><br/>Like 1983's ""WarGames"" (which also featured a motorcycle-riding female lead), the central idea in ""Terminator"" is that computers might one day destroy humanity. Unlike ""WarGames,"" which approached the subject from a software angle and took its cues from real programming concepts, ""Terminator"" casts a tangible piece of hardware in the role of unstoppable stalker killer. This leads to perhaps its only real weakness as a movie. Toward the end, as plot recedes and special effects (mostly stop motion) come to the fore, it begins to feel too much like the horror movies that it echoes in its opening text. The false endings that typify that genre are as predictable as ever, and the Terminator becomes just another riff on Michael Myers. But if the penultimate scenes are derivative, they are nevertheless satisfying, and the film ends on a note that provides closure and leaves you eager for more."

But due to John not being born yet, the ""Terminator"" as they referenced it, was instead forced to terminate Sarah Connor. <br/><br/>Now the film did two things to audiences: 1. It showed that Schwarzenegger, could play a different & diverse role compared to his standard Barbarian & Weightlifter roles. 2. Sci-Fi has become a serious & cool genre as of this film, due to the film being a cult classic, it cemented along with Star Wars, that Sci-Fi's were serious & cool.<br/><br/>Actors & Actresses who stared in the flick included: Michael Biehn as the futuristic protector of Sarah Connor & love interest: Kyle Reese & Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor a young woman living life until, her life is changed forever.<br/><br/>As a film Terminator earned a total of: $78,371,200 (Worldwide), however it was amongst number # 21 in 1984's Highest Grossing Films, picking up: $38,371,200<br/><br/>The film was a major success to an extent, that it sported a huge & memorable blockbuster sequel: T2: Judgement Day. <br/><br/>The Terminator Franchise is one of Sci-Fi's crown jewels including: Star Wars. This was the bases for the next 3 films in the franchise to follow & results are: T2: Judgement Day & T3 Rise of Machines. But those films will be talked about in another review.<br/><br/>So my rating for this film is a 9.2 out of 10, it is a well crafted film that James Cameron should be commended on. So if you are a fan of awesome visuals, compelling stories & overall great Sci-Fi, then look no further than The Terminator.<br/><br/>So for more reviews, stay tuned to IMDb.

","The film that gave Arnie true screen cred, and launched James Cameron's career, this modest-budget sleeper hit from 1984 has become one of the greatest-loved sci-fi films ever, featuring an iconic robotic killing machine, The Terminator.<br/><br/>The film makes full use of Arnie's imposing presence, a towering, relentless behemoth who carves a path of destruction, wiping out anyone in his way to assassinate his target - Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton, who is about to learn the fate of mankind, and her destiny to play in it.<br/><br/>Like the titular character, this film rarely lets up, only pausing for brief moments when Sarah and her protector, soldier-from-the-future Kyle Reese - Michael Biehn - hide out in a motel away from the city. Much like the bigger-budgeted Aliens, James Cameron shows what he can be capable without mega-million-dollar budgets, getting great mileage out of limited resources. Brief visions of the nuclear-ravaged L.A. of 2029 still look fantastic for their age, a bleak, hellish landscape, where everyone is in constant fear of the roving robotic 'Hunter-Killers', and the Terminators.<br/><br/>This first film has a much darker edge than the others, sometimes veering into horror territory with The Terminator a virtually indestructible, literally inhuman foe, though one who still has human organs that have to be dealt with when too damaged - like removing a damaged eyeball for example."
"Al_The_Strange","9","3","3","4 February 2013"," ""It absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!""
","Assassination and murder often makes for a thrilling story as it is, but what if the murderer happens to be a machine from the future? Unstoppable, invincible, unable to feel pain or remorse, unable to deviate from its programming. The terminator is an inherently scary figure, partly because of the traits mentioned above, and also because it comes from a scary future ravaged by nuclear war and a robot apocalypse.<br/><br/>The first Terminator film delivers its premise impeccably, and does so with an agreeable amount of action. Granted that all the sequels have surpassed this film in terms of action, The Terminator still delivers plenty of thrills as the titular machines brutally hunts down its targets. Most of the movie is comprised of chases: car chases, foot chases, with intermittent shootouts, explosions, and fights. In spite of this, the film drags very little; it's actually quite tight, as it effectively uses the space in between the action to develop the story and characters.<br/><br/>And the story is quite sound, partly because of its unique premise, and largely because it's told really well. It makes phenomenal use of flashbacks to reinforce the background and characters of the story. Its focus on the characters is superb, and you really grow to care for them by the film's end. Overall, the film shows great depth and detail to make it stand above and beyond most other sci-fi flicks.<br/><br/>The film looks great, with excellent photography and editing. A lot of scenes, such as the nightclub scene, leaves a great lasting impact. Acting is great: I love Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their respective roles. Writing is pretty decent. This production has plenty of good, utilitarian sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is really weird, but very moody and appropriately industrial.<br/><br/>Highly recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)"

","""The Terminator"" is one of the most popular movies that was made back in the mid-80s, and it has been well-remembered by critics and audiences alike. Everyone has seen this movies and knows it quite well as much as its famous sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" I don't know if I had anything new to say about this movie because everyone already knows well about ""The Terminator"" and why its so darn good about it. This movie was directed by James Cameron who would go on to make the second ""Terminator"" movie along with the second ""Alien"" movie, ""The Abyss,"" ""True Lies,"" ""Titanic,"" and now ""Avatar."" I know that Cameron considered this movie to be his first film because his previous film ""Piranha II: The Spawning,"" was going to be but some random people of the movie took over and wasn't like the way the Cameron envision it. So he just ignores that movie and considers ""The Terminator"" as his first film because he had more control than he had with the second ""Piranha"" movie. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, which it was his first time to play a villain and he really does a fascinating job to not only he embodied the character, but making it such a memorable role. He is the Terminator. Michael Biehn was also great as Kyle Reese along side with Linda Hamilton as John Connor's mother Sarah. The movie really does go at a really good pace, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. The music by Brad Fiedel is one of the greatest scores that has ever been heard in this kind of movie with the use of synthesizer, and featuring the famous ""Terminator Theme."" The special effects in this movie are really good in this movie, especially with the design of the Terminator by the great Stan Winston. The effects are no ""Terminator 2,"" but they are still really good before there was any CGI as what most filmmakers are using by today's special effects. The story is really well told and very effective as the premise goes along without any subplots or any of that mumble jumble. All it is that one is really trying to protect Sarah Connor, while the other to terminate and that is all you need for a story like this. ""The Terminator"" is a classic movie of the 80s that mixes with action, horror, and science fiction. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out! I give this movie a 10 out of 10."

"The-Seeker","10","5","6","12 April 2014"," An Undisputed Classic Film (Tech) Noir.
","*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>The fact that James Cameron's low budget 1984 breakthrough film, The Terminator is an undisputed classic of 80's cinema and cinema in general is just that, undisputed. It is however, one of a handful of first films that may be bettered by its sequel, in this case Cameron's 1991 epic, big budget follow up, Terminator 2: Judgement Day. For me the second film had always been my favourite of the two (I try to ignore the rest) but on re- watching the original recently I have a renewed love of the film. It's grittiness and dark tone, devoid of humour is very refreshing in this sanitised PG-13 age of Hollywood that we now live in. <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger is unrelentingly menacing as the titular killer cyborg from the future and it's a stunningly well paced film. It's very much a product of the 80's with its garish fashion and big hair but that's in no way a bad thing as it's setting is very much an integral part of the plot. T2 is grander, more epic and still near flawless but I fear it suffers from too much exposure if there can be such a thing. It's been on TV a million times and released more times on various home video formats than almost any other film and is maybe a little too much in the public lexicon to be viewed outside of itself and it's own reputation. The original has a lower budget feel that gives it an almost indie quality that has done it no such harm. Set over the course of two days and nights there is a greater sense of intimacy with the first film and a dark tone that's very film noir (or should that be Tech Noir?). <br/><br/>Schwarzenegger, in only his second major role, has only a handful of lines but commands the screen with a presence that sets him apart as one of cinemas truly frightening villains. When you consider that both OJ Simpson and Lance Henriksen had been considered for the role prior to the Austrian Oak it's lucky that Cameron made such an inspired casting decision and it would be interesting to peer into an alternate universe and see what the other two actors would have brought to the role. <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton shines as Sarah Connor, the T-800's timid, shell-shocked target and by film's end it's great to see her transition into something that more closely resembles (at least mentally) T2's ripped killing machine mom. Michael Biehn also gives a superb, understated performance as the battle-weary human soldier sent back to protect Sarah. The sense of impending doom he conveys whilst never straying from his mission adds immensely to the film's pre-post-apocalyptic theme. <br/><br/>There are many great plot devices and technical flourishes that I could mention such as the idea that Kyle is the father of the man that sent him back to the past in the first place, a mind bending temporal causality loop that gives food for thought and debate. <br/><br/>On the technical front the cinematography, iconic score and soundtrack and tight editing are all first rate. One particular scene representative of these aspects so finely melded by Cameron's deft hand is the scene where Sarah and the Terminator first meet. As the cyborg walks through the Tech Noir nightclub and approaches the table where Sarah sits waiting for the arrival of the LAPD, the film shifts into a dreamlike slow motion as Sarah knocks a bottle onto the floor, bends down to pick it up just long enough for the T-800 to miss her as he passes. The 80's rock music is now muffled by the dilation of time as the score comes in, Sarah gets up and sees not the cyborg but Kyle staring at her from across the bar oblivious to the fact that her hunter has now doubled back and is about to see her. Just as the slo-mo tension reaches a climax Kyle sees what Sarah hasn't as she lifts her gaze to the machine as he pulls out a gun, Kyle does the same and we kick back into real-time and all hell breaks loose. This level of tension is maintained for the film's duration and marks it as one of cinema's most efficient thrillers. <br/><br/>We've since seen what Cameron can do with huge budgets and established effects houses and there's no denying that he's more than made his mark on the movie world. However, one can't help but think that ever since he declared himself King of the World, his films, quality wise at least, have diminished. I still lean towards T2 as the more personally fulfilling entertainment spectacle of the two films but back in 1984 with very real limitations made worse by on-set woes, problems with studio heads and the lack of any prior reputation, Cameron made best of what he had and that estimated $6.4 million budget was stretched further than anyone could have imagined. He ended up giving us a classic film of such quality that it made sure that the audience, like the Terminator himself, would indeed be back."
"fredericksmith1952","10","5","6","7 March 2012"," Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison
","Based on the writings of science fiction author Harlan Ellison, James Cameron's dark vision of the future was a launching pad for several careers in Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the height of his career and appearance in 1984, so his size and musculature made him the perfect choice to play the killing machine from the future. Linda Hamilton became a star after a somewhat lackluster career by portraying Sarah Connor, a role she reprises in T2: Judgment Day. Micheal Biehn, a heretofore minor character actor, gained overnight popularity as Kyle Reese and went on to film other action films, including Navy Seals and Aliens. Even Lance Henriksen can claim a large amount of his success on his role as Det. Hal Vukovich, and both Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were seen early in their careers thanks to their brief but memorable roles as the punks who first confront the Terminator.<br/><br/>While the special effects were not what we would expect to see now, for 1984 they were exceptional. The mechanical movements of Arnold were timed and precise, and the skeletal movements of the Terminator at the end of the film are matched with his character. There are some disparities in the plot, but those are the normal disparities that come with any time travel story. The action, once we get past the initial introduction of characters, is fast. Even when the action slows, the plot moves forward with a consistency rarely seen in action films, and the on-going development of the characters is well written and acted. Its popularity is apparent, since it has spawned no less that three sequels which manage to cover every question, including how John Conner got the scars across his face. Rated R for sex, language, and violence, older teens will probably not find the solitary scene between Sarah and Kyle too embarrassing, and the younger kids should be in bed. Definitely a collectible for any good collector."

","When it came out many people saw this film as a bad, low-budget B-move, and laughed at it. These people couldn't have felt very smart afterwords...<br/><br/>The Terminator can be looked on two different ways: either it's a average sci-fi action film about a killer robot that goes on a killing spree, or it may be one of the best and deepest sci-fi movie ever made. I see it as the last one. Sure the action is great and Arnold as the terminator is just bad-ass. But I feel that it contains a message(or warning) that maybe technology moves at a speed that may cause it to harm us in the end. When you think about it, when this movie came out, many of the things in the movie seemed impossible. But now only 30 years later we are closing in on ""The Terminator"" future. In this age technology are used to make weapons more and more advanced, and we are already using robots on the battlefield(for example the predator drone).<br/><br/>This makes me think, where will it stop (if ever), and will we in the end have made such powerful weapons that it exposes a threat to mankind... something to think about.<br/><br/>I'll be back"

","Yes , Terminator, the big and bad cyborg , Arnold is great, i am a fan of this guy for so many years. I think Terminator is one of his best moments. This film is really violent,not violent in the sense of reality , but in film, in a car crash we see the body in there, hit the wall, smash his head in the car, of course is a robber Terminator there, but creates a impact see scenes like that. The scene were he is after Linda Hamilton in the Police Department, there is the inspiration for the future FPS games. The part of the apartment ""Fuck you asshole "" was great, he nows exactly what to say in the situation. 10 TO 10 , awesome."

","Good action movies like this are rare. They just don't make them like they used to. But this is one for the ages. You can not create another storyline like this one and get even 1/10 the results.<br/><br/>The Terminator is a classic and most likely will be even after the ""future"" portrayed in the film. James Cameron has done a great job of creating one of the best movies of all times.<br/><br/>First off, there's a perfect cast. Every part seems to have been specially designed for the actor. The Terminator could not have been played by anyone other than Arnold. If the Terminator is played by anyone BESIDES Arnold, then it is not being played correctly. Arnold plays him so coldly but very cool as well (if THAT makes any sense). Michael Biehn plays the fearless, mentally unstable hero, Kyle Reese better than anyone else could have. Linda Hamilton shows her famous ""heroine"" performance here as the young, not-yet-tough Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>Combine great performances with a perfect story and you have one of the best movies ever made. This movie can seem like a slasher at times, but it is far above any slasher.<br/><br/>This is one movie that everyone should see at least once. 10/10. If you haven't seen this movie, you either don't have the money to see it or you just don't like good movies. (Comment rating going to hell for that one)"

","""The Terminator"" was such a big hit when it got to theaters in 1984. ALthough the film's budget was somewhat low, the film managed to earn a lot of respect and attention from fans of the science fiction genre.<br/><br/>The movie's storyline is very imaginative. It features a story of time-travel mixed with action elements, and a dose of romance. The special effects were pretty good for its time. The action scenes were very fierce, which can leave the viewers on the edge of their seats. And the romantic chemistry between Michael Biehn's & Linda Hamilton's characters was very believable, and it makes the viewer want to know more about their characters.<br/><br/>Most of the film was shot at night, which gives the atmosphere in the movie a more darker feeling. It also helped the film-makers' greatly because the budget was very low.<br/><br/>And finally, the Terminator itself is arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role. He fits the role of the musclebound cyborg perfectly. Furthermore, he was very believable as a half-man-half-machine ""bounty hunter"". Plus, he was really scary.<br/><br/>Overall, The Terminator is an excellent sci-fi film with a great storyline and great actors & actresses. It is a true Sci-Fi classic that spawned a great sequel and was referenced in many later films. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend that you do so."

"DarthBill","10","5","6","7 April 2004"," The kind of film that aspiring screen writers of today wish they had thought of first...
","When James Cameron finally got the Terminator made, the studio refused to advertise it as a ""science fiction film"", which puzzled Cameron. When he asked why, they said it didn't count as science fiction because it wasn't set in outer space like Star Trek and Star Wars. Jim shot back that it was science fiction because it dealt with time travel and cyborgs. This was significant for science fiction film making because, as much fun as those out of this world galaxies are, science fiction can still be compelling when set on Earth. The film also made a star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, technically ""Conan the Barbarian"" did that, but ""Terminator"" helped him break out of costume films and get into the shoot 'em ups.<br/><br/>Arnold plays the title character, a robot in human skin sent back to 1984 LA to kill Sarah Connor (a 28 year old Linda Hamilton with her hair dyed dirty blond), a good natured but lonely, somewhat scatter-brained, hapless waitress who has no idea of just how important she really is: she's the mother of John Connor, the man who will save what's left of the human race in the year 2019 when the machines have almost succeeded in taking over the world. Sarah's only hope is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, who later starred in James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss""), a soldier sent back from the future to protect her from the Terminator. Chaos and mayhem ensue, along with a high body count and the unexpected love story between Sarah & Kyle, the latter who turns out to be John Connor's father. Oh the irony of Kyle's response to Sarah's question about John's father: ""John never said much about him... I know he dies before the war.""<br/><br/>Yes, some of the special effects are dated (namely the puppet head used for the scene where the Terminator cuts out its damaged eye and a few of the stop motion effects) and it's set in its era and it kind of runs out of steam towards the end, but the rest of the film is great: it's dark, it's eerie, it's seamy, it's atmospheric, it's violent, it's got pretty much everything. Arnold dominates pretty much every scene he's in. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are sympathetic protagonists.<br/><br/>Personally, I like this one better than the sequels, possibly because there's no Edward Furlong in it. The big difference between the films is that the original was more of a thriller, an extended chase scene, whereas the sequels were more about style and special effects and blow you away action sequences. But it's all good in the end. This is also a great examination of what could happen should technology get out of hand, ala ""Blade Runner"".<br/><br/>The DVD has two options of sound effects, the old mono system and a newer, more sophisticated one. I highly advise you not to listen to the newer sound system because it makes everything in the film sound really fake. The DVD also has deleted scenes, mostly notably a scene where Reese suffers an emotional break down over being displaced in time, an angle that never surfaced in the film but would have been very interesting to bring up.<br/><br/>""I'll be back."""

","$100million or more may have been spent to make the much celebrated sequel, but this, the original, stays longest in my mind, and I suspect a good many other people's too.<br/><br/>For all the hype about T2, that film simply does not have the narrative drive which is on show here. Fusing the concept of time travel with the theme of assassination, James Cameron's picture has echoes of such classics as Day of the Jackal; the extra twist here of course is that the Terminator would appear to be indestructible. It's as though Steve Austin (TV's Bionic Man) had transformed into Mr Hyde.<br/><br/>By creating a tightly written thriller, with an almost claustrophobic sense of tension to it, Cameron proved right at the start of his career he does not need a mega budget to make a great film. Indeed, it's significant to note that the two finest pictures of Cameron's career, critically at least, The Terminator and Aliens, are also the two films with the smallest budgets.<br/><br/>T2, Titanic and Avatar have reaped over $4 billion, but hand on heart, can anyone honestly claim those pictures, in regard to writing, direction, and a compelling storyline come anywhere close to the tension and sense of drama which he manages to evoke here in less than a couple of hours? I seriously doubt it."
"KinoRunner9732","10","9","13","12 May 2016"," 1984 and Beyond ...
","This quintessential marker of the decade may be modest in terms of its budget. But it's certainly epic in terms of its ideas. A piece of action-packed ""tech stuff"" on the surface, ""The Terminator"" comes a very long way from simply being a stylish noiresque chase movie with some time travel elements thrown in to spice it up. Because, first and foremost, this stuff is thoroughly rich in meaning. In essence, it's a superbly told tale of a lone warrior on a doomed mission who is given only a fleeting moment to share with the only one of his life. While desperately trying to protect her and everything human in human beings from forces so overwhelmingly destructive that they seem to be on par with the will of the gods in Greek tragedies. And the powerful background, permeated with a sense of impending fate, against which this drama is unfolding, apart from helping to deliver a serious and convincing message, somewhat unexpectedly turns it into one of the most poignant and poetic love stories – where love conquers time and space and the moment becomes eternal. So this picture should be named among very few actually substantial and emotional fables produced by the department of mainstream entertainment – as it sets off on an infinite journey far beyond the confines of a genre  and beyond the infinite."

","I just re-watched this movie; the last time I saw it was approximately 1987. For a 1984 production, this is superb science fiction. The Terminator, like Blade Runner, represents the best of the early '80s and even today has not really been surpassed despite decades of advances in CGI, digital processing, etc.<br/><br/>The Terminator robot behaves more or less as one might expect. James Cameron is intelligent enough not to ruin the movie by anthropomorphizing the robot, in other words making it display emotions and behave too humanly. It's a computer created by computers, and acts accordingly. Arnold Schwarzenegger was at his physical peak and did a superb job conveying the sheer evil that this machine represents.<br/><br/>Sarah and Kyle were well played. She was an ""average girl"" working at a busy family restaurant and dating mediocre guys in her spare time. We watch her grow into the strong soldier that she must become to defeat not only the Terminator but to raise a revolutionary hero who will save humanity.<br/><br/>Kyle came across as a soldier who is very good at his profession, but has little exposure to the finer things, having grown up in a horrible post-apocalyptic world. He finally softens and opens up to Sarah, sparking a love affair that is heartbreakingly brief.<br/><br/>You can enjoy the Terminator and simply ignore the fact that there are sequels. #2 is not bad, but quite superfluous and contradictory to the first movie in which it was made clear that ""no one goes home, and no one else comes through"" the time machine which was smashed by the humans. The first movie is an epic story and needs no sequels. But #2 is fun if you must see a little more Arnold-as-robot."

It's a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics.

"raycherry","10","6","8","6 May 2015"," Still my number one movie of all time.
","I have no defense. I stand guilty as charged. I must be insane.<br/><br/>The Terminator, for so many, many, many reasons should never be anybody's number one movie of all time. Better ""films"" exist. Certainly better actors. Better photography and special effects existed at the time. Much classier direction could be found in abundance, I kid not.<br/><br/>It was the film of the moment, and the moment was a very complex one. A moment when two thirds of the world were holding their breath for World War III to begin. The schools and mass media were educating children as young as twelve that nuclear war was probable, and what those terrified young people needed to do should ""the four minute warning"" (in the U.K.) be given by T.V., radio and War War II relic Klaxon Horns. Yes, my generation grew up with this. When humans with itchy trigger fingers were barely being controlled by others with nerves of steel and the courage to state that Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) was not a viable solution. However, while they could not reach ""the big red buttons"", the military of the two superpowers of ""The Cold War"" were using computers and technology to enhance their reasoning and their ability to respond.<br/><br/>Films like ""The Forbin Project"" and ""War Games"" almost projected the unidentified third man into the public psyche, but these films were either too cult/boring or too Hollywood Happy Ending to hit the mark.<br/><br/>The Terminator ended all doubts. If we did not kill each other, the machines we built to ""defend"" us were the unidentified enemy and, if given enough power and freedom, they would resolve to eliminate all humans in order to survive our MAD ambitions.<br/><br/>This alone would have made this a worthy 8/10 movie, but the twist that was added by the fully comprehensible Time Travel Paradox slotted in to the life story of the main character, ""Sarah Connor"", is what maintains this film as number one for me.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert: If you have not seen it, read no further. Come back and read the rest of this review after seeing the movie (yes, really, through to the end {the movie, not this review!} ) to see if you agree.<br/><br/>The first time I saw the movie, I was perhaps 17, but the Time Travel Paradox had been hit upon by a number of books and one film in particular, ""The Time Machine"". But the consequences of changing the past that could affect the present such that you might never be born in order to travel back in time to make those changes, thus time always self corrects, etc, etc was not made so startlingly clear until ... ""What should I tell you about your father?""<br/><br/>The line just hung in the air.<br/><br/>It marked, (and still marks), the viewer deeply with a question that seems impossible to answer.<br/><br/>If Sarah Connor did not tell her son, ""John Connor"", that his already dead father had not yet been born, but that they will meet when John is a grown man and a leader of a group of guerrilla warriors fighting against artificially intelligent machines that will be set on the absolute extermination of the human race, and that he must convince and prepare that man, his father, ""Kyle Reese"", to travel back through time (through a time travel device that will be created by the genocidal machines specifically to send a robot soldier, ""The Terminator"", back to the recent past to kill John Connor's mother, Sarah, before John is born) to save his mother and ... to become his father.<br/><br/>From here, the viewer is left with an endless list of questions that can keep the mind imagining consequences of action, or inaction, on the parts of any of these three protagonists, Sarah, Kyle and John ... plus the damned Terminator and the SkyNet computer network.<br/><br/>Best movie of all time? Thirty years on, and the number of questions continues to increase. No other film, science fiction or otherwise, has created so many thoughts that related directly to my life (particularly during the Cold War), to my work (during thirty years in the I.T. industry) and to the future I see for the human race ... and as hard as we have fought to avoid it, the more we seem to be creating it.<br/><br/>""There is a storm coming"""

","I like all Terminator movies (especially the first three, all for different reasons and different qualities) and the prematurely cancelled TV series The Sarah Connor Chronicles, as well. It took a couple of years for the first one to reach me, but I did see The Terminator in a movie theatre and before Terminator 2 came out. I was actually surprised how well it worked, and having seen it countless times since then, I can confidently say it is just as effective now as it was back then.<br/><br/>The effects look a little dated today, the synthesizer-based music is pretty laughable, and the movie has an overall cheap B-movie feel (which I usually don't like), but these are minor deficiencies that do not lessen my enjoyment. The greatest virtue of The Terminator is its relentless pace, and in this respect, it surpasses all the other instalments in the series. It truly makes you feel the machine is unstoppable and allows you no rest, no breather. And the final showdown in the factory, when the terminator presses on even when it's nothing but a legless torso, is genuinely scary and suspenseful.<br/><br/>Great story, tense, chilling action, a perfectly cast, iconic character (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and one of the best pacing ever – The Terminator is a fantastic SF/action movie and a great debut for a great director."

If so, then this has gotta be the best B-Movie in history (and I absolutely love B-Movies) this film is more than any one genre, Sci-Fi, B-Movie, thriller, horror , this film has it all, even some romance thrown in, the point is it's one of the best films of its kind, one of my all time favourites.
We get a glimpse of a nightmarish future where machines rule the world and then back in (present day) 1984 LA, two men (one man man cyborg) are transported onto the LA streets both looking for a carefree young Sarah Connor, one wants to protect her, the other wants to Terminate her so the machines can continue to rule in the future and her unborn son seems to be the key to stopping them, definitely a mouthful of a plot to keep up with, so we have a cat and mouse game going as her would be killer is an unstoppable Cyborg, a T-800.<br/><br/>The tension is present throughout pretty much the whole film, the film also screams 1980s in the best possible way, the dark brooding neo noir atmosphere, the music, the lighting, the tech-noir nightclub, theirs barely no time to rest, their is tension, drama, action right from the get go to the thrilling climax.<br/><br/>The cast are fantastic here, Michael Biehn as a young soldier sent to protect Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, but the real star of the show is Arnie himself, a career defining role in an impressive film career of action packed hits, but none better is he here, a truly terrifying machine who will stop at nothing.<br/><br/>James Cameron done a brilliant job with this and the direct sequel T2, but for me the original edges it due to the sheer bleakness of the plot, the films set mostly at night and I recommend watching it in the evening believe me it is not the same watching in the daytime.
Some critics say as with all films of a certain age that its dated, special effects not good compared to today, etc etc, forget all that and just enjoy the film, immerse yourself fully and pretend your in 1984 and the films just come out.

As a matter of fact many today consider it a better film than even its sequel T2 which was a far bigger commercial and critical hit upon its release. Arnold sizzles in the role that truly defined him and it is easy to see why- He looks and acts exactly like a robot, right down to facial expressions(or lack thereof) and the stance of walk. Linda Hamilton and Michael Beihn are really good and it is a testament to Cameron's innate talent that he got such great acting from largely unknown actors. The pacing is excellent and the cinematography is suitably gritty and grainy. More than 30 years have passed since the film's release but the Terminator hasn't lost any of its punch and remains a science fiction classic."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie in order, I come to his second movie of 1984 The Terminator.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: A cyborg (Arnie) is sent from the future with one mission. Kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) also sent from the future. <br/><br/>To those that say Arnie can't act, I say watch this movie. He is TOTALLY believable as a non human!! I say that in jest of course, but it is his best performance thus far.<br/><br/>He never could have took the role if Dino De Laurentis didn't release him from his 10 year Conan contract. He agreed, but asked Arnie to keep making Conans as long as they were profitable (Thankfully after the lukewarm reception to Conan The Destroyer, Dino never wanted to make another) and to make an action movie for him when he had a script. Arnie agreed, and was free to make other movies away from Dino. <br/><br/>The $750,000 Arnie was paid for this was less than the $1,000,000 he was paid for the last Conan movie, but boy does it pay off. James Cameron is a genius, how all this came out of his head is amazing, and this is only his second feature film is beyond me. It's scarily brilliant. Everything is brilliant. The script is brilliant, the casting is brilliant, the performances are brilliant, the way it's shot is brilliant, Brad Fiedel's score is brilliant, Stan Wilsons special effects are brilliant, everything is brilliant. <br/><br/>I've already praised Arnies performance, but Michael Biehn is also brilliant as the battled scarred, but brave Kyle Reece and Linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor too. I can't fault a single performance in the movie. <br/><br/>A few dodgy effects here and there, and the implausibility of the plot (I still can't get my head around how Kyle can be John Connors Dad lol) are not enough to ruin anything. <br/><br/>In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie talks about how the role of the Terminator only having 18 lines worried him, he worried people think he was either avoiding speaking parts, or worse, most of of his dialogue was edited out because it wasn't working. <br/><br/>He also discusses how bad the promotion was for this movie. They had it as a standard B movie, he says how Cameron begged them to change the strategy of it, but they would not listen to him!! They were only interested in promoting Amadeus. The movie succeeded because of solid reviews and good word of mouth. <br/><br/>The Terminator grossed $38 million at the domestic Box Office making it the 21st highest grossing movie of 1984. Surprisingly neither was enough to beat Conan The Barbarian as a career high for Arnie at that point. <br/><br/>In a way, it's lucky for Arnie, Terminator wasn't a giant blockbuster, as he may have been typecast as a bad guy. As it was, he did a favour for Dino."

","Very rarely do you ever see an actor who fits a role so perfectly, it becomes almost impossible to imagine anyone else playing it, a few well known examples would be Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks and Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, well I would put Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator right up there, he just fits the role perfectly. His very presence, his movements and his deadpan emotionless mannerisms were in a word, perfect for the character. When he appears you just know somethings going to happen, the depiction of the Terminator's sheer relentlessness and ruthlessness in the pursuit of his mission are borderline frightening. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor turns in a brilliant performance as an ordinary person trying to get by, whose life has suddenly been turned upside down by being thrown into what can only be described as a nightmare situation, likewise Michael Biehn as the war weary soldier still bearing the scars of a troubled if not traumatic past so much so he barely knows what happiness is. The action scenes are probably some of the best I've seen, particularly the final confrontation when you think, ""what more do they have to do to beat this thing?!"". Some of the lines of the dialogue and one line in particular, have since become legend and the most well known in cinematic history. The story is compelling and even thought provoking as to where humanity could end up in the future, even the soundtrack adds to the ominous tension which you feel while watching, especially the title track which like Arnie has become so synonymous with The Terminator that most people would be able to identify immediate which movie its in. This movie will go down as an all time classic definitive action movie, and its a must see for all action movie lovers. I'll finish by describing the ending, the movie's ending is spot on as there isn't the happy ending that most action movies tend to have which can feel like an anti-climax. Oh no this movie ends on an ominous note as Sarah Connor knows the future is far from bright paving the way for the Terminator's return, or as the man himself said, ""I'll be back."""

The Terminators plan is being held back by a man named Kyle Reese who is there to protect her and the rest is bloody history. the movie is a intense action flick with decent action, a good story, and the most iconic scene in movie history, the police shoot out. i highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good flick from the 80's and to see when movies actually has effort put into them, there are a few exceptions here and there."

","It's so crazy to think that James Cameron ""peaked"" back in 1984 with ""The Terminator"". Of course the man has gone on to constantly top his achievements with stunning special effects, and the two highest grossing pictures of all time. But can you actually believe that Cameron had sold the rights for one dollar, and it has gone on to become one of the most popular movie franchises ever made?! <br/><br/>A cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from weapons program SKYNET, is sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of mankind's future saviour. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier from the future is also sent back in time to save her. ""The Terminator"" in a nutshell, is spectacular. From the ""Tech-Noir"" style, the casting and immortal theme composed by Brad Fiedel. I can't begin to say how much this left an impression on me at 10 years old, albeit my parents sat me through the sequel first in order to see if I could handle this one. <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn have a wonderful kind of chemistry, that doesn't fall into familiar mediocrity or the most absurd levels of an unexpected romance. But of course the whole movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger's playground, and boy does it look like fun to be in his shoes. What's left to say is that Cameron's shots remain ever present in my head, and Stan Winston's practical effects are still capable of making my friends stomach churn.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: An icon of Science-fiction is born, and one of the best movies you can't wait to be old enough to watch (Luckily I managed to skip a couple years). 10/10."

","The Terminator is very much a thinker's movie. The plot is that in the future there is a war between humanity and machines. The machines send back a cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill a waitress named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to the future leader of the human resistance John Connor. Humanity sends a soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah from the terminator. But Kyle is only human and therefore not as powerful. It has good action scenes but it's also very much a thinker's movie. It brings up questions like ""Are we going to destroy ourselves?"" and ""Will technology outgrow humanity?"" It brings up these questions which I seem to think about to this day. The best part of the movie is the police station shootout, where Schwarzenegger says the famous line, ""I'll be back."" Go see it."

","You hear the name James Cameron and immediately think of big Hollywood spectacle. I mean, if nothing else, he's a consummate showman. And yet, one of his best movies works strictly on economy. ""The Terminator"" takes the B-movie premise of a killer robot stalking a young woman and infuses it with imagination. It's a terrific script that takes time travel, a love story and a nightmarish vision of the future and weaves it all into something exciting. You can see the constraints of the budget in the DIY effects, but the real joys of this movie lie in its flawless pacing and brutal efficiency. Schwarzenegger is imposing enough, but the image of the endoskeleton in the factory is still scary as hell.<br/><br/>There's an imaginative sci-fi angle to this, but Cameron knows you just can't beat a good thriller.<br/><br/>9/10 9/10"

","Entertaining sci-fi action-drama.<br/><br/>Revolutionary special effects are what makes this movie special. The effects, from 1984, are still good even by today's standards. <br/><br/>The plot is not bad either. Unlike most of James Cameron's movies, which are purely style over substance (yes, I'm thinking of Titanic and Avatar in particular), this movie has a decent plot. Not entirely watertight, but it exists and is reasonably coherent and plausible and not merely a medium for linking action scenes.<br/><br/>Though he had done the two Conan movies before this, it is this movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star. Not there for his acting abilities, or linguistic skill, he was every bit the action figure (not quite action hero...). <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton was solid in her role (though her hair style shows this movie was made in the 80s...). Michael Biehn was OK, though sometimes came off as too over-the-top in his performance."
"alindsay-al","9","4","5","12 March 2014"," A fantastic action film that was ahead of its time
","When talking about the great sci fi action films the terminator is always near the top for me and was massively ahead of its time. The story sees that in the future the machines have taken over until they are defeated by a leader called John Connor. In a last ditch attempt they send a terminator back to the 1980s to kill his mother Sarah. In response Connor sends one of his best soldiers back to protect his mother. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger has become famous for his portrayal as the terminator and this is one of the best villain roles ever. He totally encapsulated what this cyborg needed to be and it is one of the best ever villain performances. Linda Hamilton is best known for her portrayal as Sarah Connor and she is really good in her role and because of her averagness you really care about her character and hope nothing bad happens to her. Lt traxler was a pretty good character too even though he isn't in the film that much. Maybe the only negative I have about this film is the character of Kyle Reese, i'm not sure if it's the performance or if he is really just good for exposition. The character was important and I just wasn't a big fan of the character. The story is simple but effective and it just works. Also James Cameron created a sci fi universe in this film and it is one that fits the dystopian idea perfectly. The script is great with the dialogue between the characters feeling natural and made the characters, also this film has some of the most iconic lines in film history in it. The style is fantastic with all the action scenes being exciting and high octane, also the design of the terminator was way ahead of its time and it was great in this film. Also the future scenes were great in the way they should be. Overall this is a fantastic film that you should definitely see."

","Who can turn down a James Cameron film like this? The Terminator (1984) is a classic on every level. The story was brilliantly written. The cast that was chosen for each role was done perfectly. The special effects, although very outdated by today's standards, still entertains and inspires the next generation of sci-fi filmmakers. And the music was an extreme role player throughout.<br/><br/>The whole story itself is an enormous step in a new direction. At the time, no one was truly thinking about the possible downside to artificial intelligence. But who could have thought that machines could become smarter than humans and decide to take over? Well James Cameron did. The plot is so in depth with detail that it's hard not to become involved in the plot as well.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger being the choice of the Terminator was the best choice the casting department could have ever done. Not only is he good but he can be quite terrifying too. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was accurate because although she's scared quite often throughout the running time, she later becomes a much stronger individual. And Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese was a good choice too because he definitely acts and looks like a run down soldier looking to find a way to change the future that he came from.<br/><br/>Stan Winston and his team of specialists provide the special effects and boy do they look great. With a mix of using puppetry and stop-motion animation, the entire look of the terminator is very interesting to watch. Not to mention that this thing can take a beating, either by its enemies or by itself! And the music by Brad Fiedel adds the final touch to the film. Fiedel makes the music have a sci-fi tone and whenever the terminator is on screen, there's a certain theme to it that gives it a very ominous feel. It's very creepy, but effective! It's surprising that director Cameron came to such glory from this movie after he directed such a sub-par film known as Piranha Part II: The Spawning (1981)!<br/><br/>This is the film that launched director James Cameron into show biz. With all the elements picked out perfectly, The Terminator is bound to strike the right chord."

","The ""Terminator"" was one of the best action films of all time, with the exception of it's sequel, and executed with a bunch of no name actors and a shoestring budget...not to mention a director with almost no experience, it's an amazing feat to say the least. It's been 28 years since it's release, and while some special effects have aged inevitably, the effect of the movie itself has not.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton, Arnold (I'm not even going to try and spell that last name), and especially, the cult following worthy Michael Biehn for his characters alone, all give good performances. The film has a few very minor flaws, but is not reflective onto the enjoyment or quality factor. The action and the story are all paced nicely, has excellent direction, the characters have are well developed, and the overall content is quite impressive. The movie is fairly simple, but is extremely effective. Terminator has been deemed a classic and respectfully so. I'm sure it will provide a great movie experience for myself and others for many years to come. The idea of a machine sent to kill you that is all but unstoppable, without any remorse or hesitation, is very chilling and is one of the film's main reasons for such success. I don't need to say any more, you've seen it. Needless to say, this film started many careers of those involved. Classic.<br/><br/>An absolute must for any action or sci-fi fan's collection."

In a last ditch effort, Skynet sent a cyborg, called a ""Terminator"", back in time to 1984 to kill Connor's mother Sarah before she would give birth to John.<br/><br/>Protector for Sarah against the terminator: John Connor sent back his own operative, a young man named Kyle Reese, to save Sarah. <br/><br/>Question is which one will reach Sarah first: The Terminator or Kyle?<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger (who plays the cyborg) was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Barbarian, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, ""Oh some sh*t movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.""<br/><br/>In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.<br/><br/>For the role of Reese, various other suggestions were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the movie was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his ""feelings about the project changed"". Hurd stated that ""almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between (Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese). They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.""<br/><br/>On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4,020,663 making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God!

Ellison believed that the screenplay for the film was based on the episodes ""Soldier"" and ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" which he wrote for the television series The Outer Limits. Orion gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and gave him an acknowledgement credit in later prints of the film. Cameron was against Orion's decision and was told that that if he did not agree with the settlement, they would have Cameron pay for any damages if Orion lost Ellison's suit. Cameron replied that he ""had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth.

","The Terminator is definitely one of the best Science fiction films ever made. A lot of people argue on which film is better Terminator 1 or Terminator 2, but in my opinion the first Terminator film is the better film. Although Terminator 2 (also 3) were fantastic films with better action scenes and special effects than the first Terminator film, what I prefer about the first Terminator film is the good acting,(especially by Kyle Rees/Michael Biehn) sense of depth and storyline that the other two sequels lacked. What all three Terminator films had in common were that they had elements of Science Fiction and action in them, but what the first Terminator film had that the other sequels didn't have was that it had a romance element. The romantic side of this film is how Kyle Rees travelled back in time to meet Sarah Connor(to save her from the Terminator) and falling in love with one another, while conceiving their son John Connor during their short time together. This film is quite similar to the film 'Somewhere in Time' with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour for that film is also about a man who travels back in time to be with the women he loved.<br/><br/>The whole concept of how Kyle Rees was sent back in time from the year 2027 to the year 1984 to save Sarah Connors life from the Terminator and then impregnating her with John Connor (the Future Saviour) is a mind boggling concept. Where does it all begin and end? If Kyle Rees from the future didn't go back in time to the year 1984, John Connor would never have been, but yet it makes absolutely no sense WHATSOVER, that Kyle Rees could be his father considering the peculiar circumstances - however he was his father for unexplainable reasons. The story just goes round and round in circles. In answer to how John Connor was Kyle Rees' son was that the original John Connor from the year 2027 wasn't Kyle Rees' son as he was somebody elses son. When John Connor sent Kyle Rees to the year 1984 to save his mothers life from the Terminator, Kyle Rees accidentally corrupted history by impregnating Sarah Connor with their son John Connor, who of which wasn't the original John Connor. When Sarah Connor found out that she was pregnant with Kyles son, she mistakenly assumed that her unborn child was the saviour John Connor from the future - when he wasn't. The real John Connor would have been a son that she would have had with another man(In a different parallel universe) who of which was never born, for Kyle Rees prevented her from meeting him because he changed history by telling her about the future - as this somehow prevented her from meeting the father of the real future saviour John Connor and bearing him as there son. Thereafter the alternate John Connor who was conceived from Kyle Rees became the new future Saviour only because his mother prepared him for it and because he wanted to live up to his mothers death wish. Its all quite complicated; the whole sequential repetitive cycle of Kyle Rees going back in time to the year 1984 and then another 44 years passes to the year 2027 and then Kyle rees travels back to the year 1984 is a never ending cycle, as its an infinite cycle that goes round and round in circles forever. The first cycle of the original undisrupted John Connor who sent his Sergeant (not father) Kyle Rees to the year 1984, was in fact the only undisrupted future history cycle that happened. However, every other time travel sequence that goes on and on forever in time travel circles that occurred after that original time travel cycle, was in fact the disrupted time travel cycles with the alternate John Connor in a new and changed parallel universe - this is as explained all due to Kyle Rees accidentally altering history. Considering the alternate John Connor took over from the original John Connor who of which got erased from time all due to Kyle Rees, one could say that the original John Connor never even existed - but yet he did! He lives in the lost dimensions/parallel universe of time.<br/><br/>As this film is Science fictional, romantic and action based it caters for many types of viewers, whether you're a love-sick girl/ women, a person who is action thirst or just somebody with a good imagination for imaginative people, like myself, do tend to love science fiction films.Anyway, if you haven't seen this film, I strongly suggest you to watch it, for this film is non stop action, has great film atmosphere and had a great and original storyline"

","Terminator (1) is a sci-fi/action/noir movie with a straightforward storytelling about time travel, indestructible killer machine, and everything that was 80s all about.<br/><br/>Cool Pop/rock Disco musics, 80s fashion, the electronic dark soundtrack reflecting the overshadowing story prior scenes which take place mostly in night-time, blue/red neon lights and lasers, love scene between two desperate yet heroic characters (but not in a cheese way, no sir). Everything is just perfectly lined up, telling a very dark story which holds its apocalyptic atmosphere throughout the movie from start to the end. You just smell the 80's all over the film, leaving you in such territory of feelings that today's movies cannot give, they just can't. The time travel concept suddenly becomes one with the movie's antic factor, as this period of our history presented here is no more, even if people are desperately trying to bring us back in time with their nostalgia today, no effort is enough to give us the real feelings as this movie does.<br/><br/>""Burnin' on the third degree""; ""You can't do that to me""; only the choice of music gives the right view to Cameron's sense of conceptualism, reflecting the cool and innocent Sarah suddenly grabbed by an unfortunate, overshadowing sorrow, as the Terminator comes to terminate her for actions that haven't even occurred from her view. Then ""Pictures of you, from another time and place"" puts Kyle Reese into this concept as he held the one and only photo of the woman of importance, Sarah Connor. Besides all this the seemingly unavoidable dark future paints the sonic foundation to the whole soundtrack, its futuristic, robotic, and deadly, but most importantly; overshadowing.<br/><br/>The story elegantly emerges prior the scenes, built around the dark tension the movie is based on, giving the right informations at the right time in a really fast yet healthy phase. <br/><br/>The acting is also spot on, especially Linda Hamilton's natural talent manifests itself in any kind of scene, let it be action, drama, horror. This also applies to Michael Biehn, even though there are some almost ""not that good"" acting from his part, however these are rare moments. And of course there is Arnie, with his muscles and plain face, that are quite enough for a part like THE TERMINATOR itself.<br/><br/>With these elements above Cameron managed to create something so perfectly pure, that it just puts his latter movies look so below class. The Terminator 2: Judgement Day that came after this maintained the quality the Terminator 1 embraced, yet it couldn't remotely bring the same tension and atmosphere that the original movie had, however anything else was brought to the next level by which the movie Terminator 2 - from technical point of view - is still up to date. Terminator (1) relatively has some effects which can be considered out of date, however this immediately drops out of equation as we bring up the artistic quality of its, that couldn't and cannot be outdone by any kind of Cameron's latter productions. And that is the kind of quality that I hold most dearly. <br/><br/>Terminator 1 is easily the best in the series, that can be watched more times than any of the sequels. <br/><br/>9.5/10"

","Time-travel. Science fiction. Visions of the future. Action/Adventure. You name it, and ""The Terminator"", one of the most genre-diverse films ever made, probably has it.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie begins in the year 1984. Out of thin air, two individuals suddenly appear and are searching for the same woman: Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). One man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) wants to protect her. The other, a machine simple known as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to kill her. As the story unwinds and the chase continues, we are introduced to an intriguing storyline involving time-travel and the fate of the planet.<br/><br/>Simply stated, this movie remains a classic to this day because it tells such an engaging, interesting story. It balances the time travel and sci-fi aspects with real-life drama and action. There is a little something for everyone.<br/><br/>This was the movie that made the name James Cameron famous, and one can tell that he put a lot of effort into this undertaking. He tells a story that is actually too big (technically-speaking) for it's britches, as it is now obvious that copious amounts of either CGI or plastic were used to create some of the effects. Instead of dating the film, though, these little anachronisms actually give it a bit of gravitas. It was as if Cameron wanted so badly to direct this story, but had to rely on sub-standard equipment to ""get the job done"".<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Terminator"" is an 80s classic. It is now kind of stereotyped as ""I'll be back"" and ""just a shoot-em-up"" chase film, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Go back and watch it again, and I promise you'll be equally impressed with the storytelling ability. That, at it's core, is what makes this movie relevant 30 years later."

","30 years down the road, James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" remains an enthralling science fiction thriller, perhaps now more relevant than ever. By now nearly everyone would have heard about how Cameron miraculously made such an excellent film on a miniscule US$6 million budget or so, or perhaps how the eponymous character turned bodybuilder- cum-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger into literally Hollywood's next big thing. It is a testament to Cameron's genius into crafting his unique vision despite and because of his budget limitations, and perfectly casting his stars to suit said vision.<br/><br/>We all know the drill by now, so let's talk quality. Linda Hamilton portrays Sarah so well as a normal young woman, confused by this sudden chain of events, that she has logically no choice but to buy into Reese's story. Michael Biehn fits Reese to a T with a gruff yet youthful look, a perfect look for a determined soldier fighting a war he wants to end badly, despite his limitations. Though it's under a relatively short amount of time, Cameron takes his time for the audience to really get to understand both Sarah and Reese's predicaments – to have characters to root and care for, to see them find a way out despite the odds. And a romantic twist is added by Cameron that surprisingly doesn't feel forced, yet somehow perfectly (and ironically) completes the time travel loop that secures John's existence. We're dealing with a romance that transcends both time and space, and Cameron handles it so well, he would revisit these romantic traits with greater detail in his future megalith ""Titanic"".<br/><br/>What makes the film work more than it should is Cameron's genius in casting Schwarzenegger as The Terminator. A former Mr. Olympian, Schwarzenegger is renowned for his sculpted body – straight out of a Greek stone garden – more than his acting prowess. No matter, his manner of speaking less, and frighteningly intimidating stare clearly unnerve the hell out of audiences, and they still do today. Say what you will about Schwarzenegger's career as an action icon/live-action meme, the man still has a stare that can kill. His strong, iconic Austrian accent works wonders with the machine-like delivery that Cameron was intending. With Schwarzenegger's casting, the stakes are higher for both Sarah and Reese to escape this monstrosity.<br/><br/>Because time-travel is involved and explained in an easily digestible way (physics be damned), and because Cameron directs with such efficiency and confidence it might as well be made today, the film has aged exceptionally well despite some cornball stop-motion effects that show off its low budget – all due praise to the late Stan Winston though for his remarkable, if not grotesque, make-up effects and design that add to the sheer horror aspect of the film. It is a testament to Cameron's genius that he has managed to combine great talent both in front of and behind the camera, into creating one of the seminal and memorable films of the '80s decade, and one that will spawn a successful sci-fi franchise with a dedicated fanbase. Make no mistake that the basic framework of ""The Terminator"" essentially represents a B-movie at its surface (Cameron did tutor under B-legend Roger Corman, after all), but Cameron pulls off more tricks up his sleeve. There is a lean, mean atmosphere that permeates each scene throughout, making 1984 Los Angeles seem like a lurid fever nightmare, but that's secondary compared to the hellish, poverty-stricken future he has envisioned for us humans. Brad Fiedel's metallic, iconic score seeps through every alley and night- painted street with a sense of dread and gloom, the synthesized, electronic score complementing Adam Greenberg's cyan-tinted, industrial cinematography to make it feel all the more nightmarish.<br/><br/>Most people back than would have balked or be amazed at a wireless internet connection for everyday use, as if we are surrendering our will to technology for it to take over our lives. And I'm seeing it being endorsed in many a commercial or article. Is the development of technology a bad thing? Not at all. But a good servant can be a bad master, especially if left out of control. Cameron had a fear of that, saw the vision, and ran with it all the way. If we were to leave our household chores to artificial intelligence, or the military leaving unmanned drones to scour the battlefield, what's there to say that eventually artificial intelligence would be used to secure nuclear weapons? Or that they might even become sentient - Cleverbot and Siri may be precursors to Skynet, and Japanese technology is developing robotic humanoids that can deduce for themselves in the near future. The war shown in the film may take place in 2029, but Judgment Day can still happen. Better never than late, I say.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" may be surpassed by its immediate successor in terms of scale and action sequences, but this is a leaner, meaner film, and its initial allegory remains superior and more clear-cut; in the realms of science fiction it remains unmatched, as a bleak reminder of the future and technology gone wrong, perfectly represented by its unstoppable, merciless eponymous monster of a character, but also that of humanity's undying spirit to create their own fates. Cameron might have come a long way since then, having helmed two of the most expensive and highest- grossing films in history back-to-back with some truly groundbreaking visual effects technology implemented in both, but this only highlights his original, cautionary vision for the future, one that we are all far too willing to embrace wholeheartedly."

"saymaraza","10","4","6","5 June 2016"," The Terminator review
","Fantastic film! my favourite film of the 80s along with Robert Zemeckis Back to the future. One of Arnold's first films as a professional Actor, and his most memorable role. With James Cameron directing, this is definitely my favourite film of his by far. Most people think that Terminator 2 is even better than this one. But for me, this beats it every time. I love Terminator 2, but i thought that it dragged out a lot longer than this film. This film was the perfect amount of time for a film to be running without getting boring. And leaves tension all the way. I used to be inspired by The Terminator when i was younger, and I'm pretty sure it was my favourite film at one point. Arnold Schwarzeneggar does such an amazing job as the Terminator, it's unbelievable. I know James Cameron tried to make him look cooler as the guardian in Terminator 2, but in this film to me is as cool as you can get. With supporting acts of Linda Hamilton (Sarah Conner) and Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese) the whole film is a complete blow-out! Schwarzeneggar was perfect for the role of The Terminator, with the size that he is, the one thing i didn't like with Terminator 2, is that he was the half the size he was in the first one. I know it was 7 years after the first one, and he had stopped bodybuilding, but still i think he should have been the same size as in the first one for playing a Terminator. With Terminator 2, it had a clever concept, and is probably the most well though out Terminator movie of them all, with Robert Patric playing a new style of Terminator. I think the first one if slightly better because it was Cameron's original idea for a film, and plus i think if you are playing a Terminator you need to be a considerably big and intimidating size like Arnold was."

","The Terminator (1984): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Paul Winfield: Exhilarating science fiction action film about all that is final. A cyborg drops to earth from an energy field. Underneath his perfect normality is a deadly machine programmed to kill Sarah Connor. A soldier from the future is sent via energy field to protect her because her life is important to the survival of the future John Connor. Extremely tense action particularly when it appears that the Terminator is virtually unstoppable. This makes room for interesting elements such as his ability to manipulate. James Cameron does an excellent job at staging the action as well as creating a convincing robotic structure. Arnold Schwarzenegger is overwhelming and intimidating as the cyborg whose defeat arrives when Connor uses the obvious against him. Michael Biehn is pushed to his physical limits as the soldier who is believed to be insane. Sarah is played by Linda Hamilton confused regarding a fate she didn't ask for. Lance Henriksen is unfortunately underused as a detective who could have provided an interesting investigating subplot. Paul Winfield plays another police official questioning Sarah Connor. The film is visually ahead of its time. Theme regards our problematic relationship with machines. Score: 9 ½ / 10"
"Munin75","10","4","6","26 July 2011"," Genius in so many ways that it's indescribable
","They just don't make movies like this anymore. Terminator, and Alien, sound to the modern ear as some silly summer blockbuster movies, with all the sequels, prequels, cross-overs and whatnot which have downplayed their image. But what many people ignore is that the first two movies of these franchises were pure 80s (approx.) sci-fi gold, and better ; acknowledged masterpieces in general. Even today, The Terminator is original, exciting, scary and pretty damn hardcore from the first scene when the robot encounters the punks, to the succession of cruel massacres perpetrated by the insensitive killing-machine Terminator throughout the movie.<br/><br/>It is hard to express just how perfect The Terminator is in terms of plot and character development, and chilling atmosphere, which keeps the spectator clinging to his seat all the way. The opening sequences of the movie ; a brief explanation of the apocalyptic future war, the filthy appearances of the two main antagonists (Terminator and Kyle Reese), contrasted with the simple 80s jolly life of Sarah Connor before hell breaks lose, is a lesson in movie making on how to forcefully grasp the audience's attention and involvement. And when you think you can start relaxing, the booming action starts again even stronger, and greater, until the final act which leaves you gasping for air. This crescendo in suspense and horror is found in a later Cameron film, Aliens, which blatantly bears the director's signature style seen in The Terminator.<br/><br/>The special effects were pretty ground-breaking and innovative at the time (something which can apparently be said for almost every Cameron movie since), but what really pulls it off is the incredibly bleak and dirty atmosphere, and of course the great cast. I couldn't possibly imagine other actors than Schwarzenegger, Biehn and Hamilton for the lead roles. All the secondary characters are also fantastic. The Terminator carries a distinct 80s feel to it which I like a lot. I wasn't born when this movie was released, and was brought up mostly on 90s movies, but I must say that the 80s feeling of The Terminator adds to its ""charm"" (if I dare say so). Nonetheless, it has survived the test of time exceptionally well, it doesn't pass as outdated at all - the climax is still genuinely frightening.<br/><br/>The fact that Cameron, at the time a newcomer, managed to direct this sci-fi masterpiece, and went on to direct sequels to both Alien and his Terminator which practically equaled if not surpassed the originals in quality, marked Cameron as one of the best new directors of his generation.<br/><br/>The Terminator is a perfect 10."
"jameslipski","10","4","6","6 February 2011"," One Hell of a Thrill Ride!
","So I am watching this movie right now on AMC and it took me back to when I originally saw it. I was in college in 1984 and I went to see this film with a good friend of mine. It grabbed my attention from the opening credits and would not let me go!<br/><br/>I had seen Arnold in a few movies so he was familiar. His performance was perfect. The adorable Linda Hamilton is terrific as the scared ""mother of the future"". The story is creepy because 26 years after it opened the concept of a machine man is believable. When this movie ended I walked out of the theater exhausted. Very few movies have had that effect on me. <br/><br/>I have watched this film maybe 30 times and never gotten bored. Highly recommended for viewing."
"MinorityReporter","9","4","6","13 January 2007"," One of the best action movies of the 80s!
","This movie is something of an enigma to me. It comes from an era in the history of film where a lot of really bad movies were made. Especially sci-fi movies suffered a lot of indignities (not counting Blade Runner, Aliens and the two Star Wars movies made in the decade) but also good action movies were quite far apart. For this movie to be a success in both genres is quite something. This is James Cameron's first masterpiece.<br/><br/>Acting wise the movie is nothing short of excellent. Arnold Schwarzenegger produced the role that would turn out to be his signature role in the terminator. His acting is wooden, stiff and very emotionless which is of course perfect as he plays a robot from the future and even though he was outmatched villain wise by Robert Patrick's T-1000 in the sequel he is still very memorable in this movie and the ""I'll be back"" line is one of the most memorable of the 80s. Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor and creates a very likable, vulnerable and at the same time strong character and you can't help but sympathize with her. The strongest performance in my opinion is that of Michael Biehn who very unjustly never became a really big name in the movie industry because his performance as Kyle Reese is everything movie acting should be about. His character is both very strong but at the same time emotionally crippled. The way he plays the role with the exact right amount of desperation is pure genius. Lance Henriksen is critically underused in his role and unfortunately doesn't have enough screen time to really create a lasting impression and that's a shame.<br/><br/>The effects and action sequences are remarkably well construed, breath taking and exciting. James Cameron proves that he has a flair for action with this movie and even though the effects are dated they still somehow hold their own in a time where computer effects are dominating action movies. Especially the ending is very thrilling mainly because of the editing which basically makes the ending. The stop-motion elements of the movie work remarkably well, once again because of the editing. The film also uses full size puppets molded after Arnold's face and body and because of the lighting (and again the editing) you barely notice the change between real actor and puppet. Brad Fiedel's score has a very 80s feel to it and is practically the only thing that is not timeless about the movie.<br/><br/>All in all The Terminator is definitely one of the best action and sci-fi movies of the eighties and indeed any age. If you haven't seen it yet, you should. Don't think it's just another Schwarzenegger movie, it is so much more.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","4","7","8 November 2019"," 35 years on and The Terminator remains fantastic storytelling.
","This movie's still got it: punchy action, great techno-music adding to the 80s charm embedded in the production, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's greatest cinematic performance as The Terminator himself.<br/><br/>The Terminator is part-thriller, part-body-horror (via the T-800's disregard for its own flesh and eyes), part-neo-noir, all adrenaline-infused action telling a story of survival and desperation. It's a multi-genre and self-contained masterpiece that captured everything special about cinema in the 80s; and it's the film that catapulted James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into Hollywood stardom.<br/><br/>This film's always been a favourite of mine, and it's still great rewatching over and over again. It's just one of those movies that you can keep rewatching and find something new almost every time you rewatch it.<br/><br/>Hollywood can keep trying to make a sequel to this and Terminator 2; it doesn't change the fact that the first two Terminator movies are incomparable classics of the sci-fi genre.<br/><br/>Is there anything about this movie that hasn't already been said? I'm not sure, but I can say that this movie's had a wonderful impact on people's creativity, and modern Hollywood owes a lot to this humble film and James Cameron."

Only one man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier from the future, can help her her to stay alive...<br/><br/>The Terminator, the film that rocketed James Cameron to A-list director status, and gave Arnie his most iconic role (the one which saw him coin his catchphrase ""I'll be back""), is such an accomplished piece of action/sci-fi in almost every department that, even after 25 years and many, many viewings later, it never fails to impress me.<br/><br/>A top notch cast (which also includes Cameron regulars Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton), excellent Stan Winston effects, and a terrific score by Brad Fiedel, combined with Cameron's flawless handling of his material and Schwarzenegger's suitably mechanical performance, all adds up to one of the finest movies ever made.

He steals clothes from a homeless man and evades the police. The Terminator begins systematically killing women named Sarah Connor, whose addresses he finds in the telephone directory. He tracks the third Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The two steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car.<br/><br/>As they hide in a parking lot, Kyle explains to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware in the near future and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes him appear human."
"Leofwine_draca","10","3","5","11 November 2016"," A beloved favourite of mine
","Widely regarded as something of a classic in the realms of science fiction and action films, I think that this film is an underrated horror film and may be in fact one of the most frightening films I have ever seen, due to the fact that I had a fascination for it as a child. Director James Cameron, better known to modern audiences for his bloated epic TITANIC, truly succeeded in creating a classic film, one which I would watch many times over his later, waterlogged dreck. THE TERMINATOR was a hugely popular hit and created a new movie monster, the big, silent, hulking figure of Arnold Schwarzenegger in what I believe to be his best role as an unstoppable killer. The fact that the monster is human - and thus able to hide amid fellow humans - is relatively original (depends on who you speak to, but acknowledgement definitely goes to Harlan Ellison) and his sheer indestructibility is really awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>All of the different factors work in this film. The score is unforgettable, a thumping, deadly beat which turns up whenever the Terminator is on screen, and it sends chills down your spine (much like the music for THE OMEN). The film portrays Los Angeles as a dark, dirty, bleak city to live in and the film reflects this. It has a gritty feeling much like the earlier classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the little touches, such as the Terminator's infra red vision, are chilling.<br/><br/>The actors in this film all give brilliant portrayals and are totally realistic, many of them have since gone on to greater things. Schwarzenegger emerged as an action movie star after this film put him on the map and has since become phenomenally successful, with a string of hits in his belt. Biehn has also kept in the movie business but hasn't found many hits like this one, apart from Cameron's 1986 smash, ALIENS. Hamilton has also gone on to bigger-budgeted things like DANTE'S PEAK and her portrayal of Connor as an unsuspecting woman caught up in the violence is a performance which brings real depth to the character. She turned this around in the sequel where Connor became a lean, lithe killer out for survival. Paul Winfield is great as the hard but kind cop, and Lance Henricksen, who was originally considered for the role of the Terminator, makes the best of his small role. Earl Boen is also memorable as the laconic psychiatrist. Roger Corman regular Dick Miller puts in a welcome cameo appearance as the ill-fated gun store owner, while Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson appear in early roles in their careers.<br/><br/>This film is also surprisingly gory for a mainstream movie. One scene, in which the Terminator rips out his own eye, parallels the ultra-violence popular in Fulci movies. People are repeatedly and violently shot and mutilated. To keep things moving along there is a ton of action in the film, with hundreds of bullets flying everywhere and numerous car chases. The only spot where things let up is near the end where Reese and Sarah hide out in first a tunnel and then a motel. This section of the film tends to veer into mild tedium and is the only part where Cameron could have done better.<br/><br/>The film has many classic, totally brilliant moments. One of these is the Tech Noir scene, which builds up suspense carefully before exploding into violent carnage. It's a nightmarish and completely effective moment, with the music slowing down, people dancing in slow motion. Another scene is the one where the police station is single-handedly destroyed by the Terminator, this shows how unstoppable he is and is again very violent and effective. The final future 'dream' sequence in which the dying, diseased survivors are killed by another machine is also brutally effective and very moving. Other memorable moments are the scene where the metal Terminator rises from the flames, which is almost Biblical, and the entire fight in the factory, which is basic human vs. machine action, where the Terminator keeps coming back time after time before being finally crushed to death.<br/><br/>Cameron returned with a successful sequel in 1991, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. The film contained then state of the art CGI effects in the ""morphing"" T-100 terminator, and signalled the return of Schwarzenegger and Hamilton (and also Reese in the Director's Cut). Although the film contained a lot of action and violence, it was not as effective and horrifying as it was basically a string of action scenes one after the other, and more designed to show off special effects work instead of telling a story. However the sequel is still hugely enjoyable and well worth seeing if you liked this one.<br/><br/>Overall, THE TERMINATOR is a true classic in the realms of killer robot movies, the best one ever made in my opinion. It also clearly shows how science fiction and horror can be mingled together to form a pleasing whole. An excellent film for those of us who like action as well as horror, it's got everything you could ever want: time travel, gun battles, car chases, fights, gore, explosions, fire, melodrama, romance, an excellent score, and true gut wrenching horror. Excellently fantastic!"
"sebtwister","10","3","5","28 September 2016"," ""It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.""
","There used to be a time I thought the sequel blew this movie completely out of the water, because it's bigger and more epic in scale and the action is a lot stronger, but this is one of those films where it gets stronger with every re-watch. There's always something I pick up on every time I see it.<br/><br/>The Terminator is an unrelenting experience to say the least and the whole premise of this where an almost indestructible machine only has one thing in mind, to kill you, and will stop at absolutely nothing to do it, is terrifying. It is such a simple premise, yet the way James Cameron writes and directs these characters makes this film almost perfect in my eyes.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner is a much more grounded and vulnerable character in this film compared to the badass she would become in the sequel. In fact, she was completely unrecognisable to me once the second film roles on, yet it never feels far- fetched she would become this way because of how good the character development is in this film. You see her gradually become the soldier she is truly destined to be and all of it feels real. Plus, you've gotta love that mullet :)<br/><br/>Michael Biehn as Kyle Reece is terrific in this film and again he also feels like a grounded character. In fact straight away it's impossible not to see the vulnerability of the character when you see all the marks and scars all over his body as he comes through the time portal. He is completely outmatched by The Terminator he is assigned to protect Sarah from so he has to out smart it. You see that life as a soldier in a post-apocalyptic world where man fights machines, is the only thing he has ever known in his life, and there's a lot of great flashback scenes that really emphasise that point so effectively. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn share great chemistry together as well, I really did buy the fact they loved each other despite the fact they only know each other for a day.<br/><br/>Of course, how could I not mention Arnie as The Terminator. He's another one of those badass villains that has very little dialogue, but you you feel the intensity amp up every time he's on screen. To say he is a presence would be an understatement, he is friggin' scary as a villain because all he cares about is killing Sarah Conner... that's it, that is the only thing he was sent to do and he stops at absolutely nothing to do it. It is just so intense, when you see a scene where Kyle shoots him multiple times, and all it does is buy some time. And it just returns to the deadly game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>There are only brief fleeting moments where the film allows you to breathe. There is not a single scene in the film where I felt like it was filler or just there to kill time, it is a tightly edited masterpiece of cinema that just never lets up. It doesn't dumb itself down so that its more accessible to the audience either, there's a good 45 minutes or so where you don't know why this thing is targeting Sarah, or why she is so important and it doesn't matter because the film allows the atmosphere to take over. When she does find out why she's being targeted, it never feels tacked on, forced or drawn out with exposition.<br/><br/>I would not change a single thing about the story or the characters in this film. There are one or two effects in this such as the 'eye' scene are dated by today's standards, but given the films budget was only $6 million, significantly smaller than the blockbuster sequel, there's bound to be a few dated scenes here or there, but it doesn't hurt the experience. There's still something about that final scene with the stop motion exoskeleton that just has my skin crawling. It is such an intense final act, that had me gripped right to the end! It is a filmmaking achievement and one of my favourite films of all time :)"

This movie was released in 1984, in the United States of America. It is a movie that contains scenes of action, adventure, fiction and much tension with a length of 107 minutes. The main actors of the cast are: Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator), Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor) and Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese). <br/><br/>The legend has as plot the story of Sarah Connor as the leader of the human resistance to combat the killing machine (""The Terminator""), which is sent from the future to kill her, and she has as protector Kyle Reese, also sent from the future to protect her from the Terminator. <br/><br/>Actress Linda Hamilton has done an extraordinary job in the movie, when she expressed with excellence the feelings of courage, determination and leadership of the legendary Sarah Connor. The Facial and body expressions of Linda Hamilton were appropriate to the moments of tension, action and suspense, when in confrontation with the killing machine. The performance of this actress was magnificent. <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger was the ideal actor to perform the killing machine because of your physical characteristics (strong, high and muscular), of the violent and ungoverned movements made in scenes that were faster, typical movements of a machine, and also of your coldness and indifference in relation to humanity. <br/><br/>Michael Biehn had a good performance too, because he convinces the spectator of his protective function in relation to Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>It's an excellent movie because it mixes action, adventure, tension, fiction and suspense along with sound and visual effects (explosion, fight, fire), atmospheric effects of light and darkness, and a logical sequence from one scene to the next, during all the story.

Don't' get me wrong, Terminator 2 was great but I prefer the original with its darker atmosphere and soundtrack.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with this movie."

","It's hard to review a real classic. What do you say about a movie that's not just a great piece of entertainment, but is significant in the history of film? <br/><br/>The Terminator tells us the story of Sara Connor (Linda Hamilton), an ordinary young woman who works as a waitress and lives with a roommate, who learns she's to give birth to the savior of humanity. That's what she hears from Reece (Michael Biehn), a soldier sent back from a post-apocalyptic future where machines and men are at war. Reece was sent back to protect her from a killer cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that also traveled from the future to kill Sara and erase her son from existence before he could lead Mankind is a successful war against their mechanical enemies.<br/><br/>When you say a movie is about a killer cyborg from the future and a main character who has to discover her inner hero, that doesn't necessarily sound like a classic, does it? It sounds just like another mediocre-at-best sci-fi melodrama, just like a couple dozen other forgettable B movies made every year that fill up the space between the really good films at the theater and on cable, another fancy premise used to tie together a bunch of explosions and special effects. But The Terminator is sooooo much more than that.<br/><br/>Virtually everything in this movie is better than it has any reason to be. Though it has a clever idea, at its core The Terminator is a fairly basic adventure story. It's not inherently deep or complex or profound. There's no real social commentary to it or any examination of essential human conflicts. It's a chase movie. One with a genuinely clever angle, but still a chase movie. That sort of film doesn't necessarily demand superior writing, acting or directing but all of those things are present in The Terminator.<br/><br/>I think the best way to demonstrate how good this movie is, is too simply take note of the little things done well in this film that you wouldn't see in lesser works. The casting of Linda Hamilton is one of those things. For the most important female character in the story, most films would usually cast an actress a lot more attractive than Hamilton. She's really only a bit prettier than the other women in the film and she's really not even as pretty as her co-star, Michael Biehn. But the story of Sara Connor is about a normal, unexceptional woman becoming the sort of person who changes human history. If Sara is a stunning beauty, it undermines the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary.<br/><br/>Take a look at the two cops played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen and the criminal psychologist played by Earl Boen. They're supporting characters whose purpose is to get the main characters from the first act into the third act. But even though they're not on screen for every long or have many lines, the actors make them into people just as real as Sara or Reece. And those three characters actually have some of the best and funniest lines of dialog in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Consider the character of Reece. He has less than a handful of lines of dialog in the first third of the film, but we understand more about him than any other character through his actions and his memories. Or look at how the film handles the Inevitable Exposition Dump. In this sort of genre picture, whether it's sci-fi or horror or what have you, there's always a moment when some character has to explain what's going on to another character, and by extension to the audience. The Terminator has one of those scenes, but instead of it happening during a dead space when the story comes to a stop, most of it occurs in the middle of a car chase! <br/><br/>You can also marvel as the visual sense Cameron brings to the entire film. From one of the earliest scenes where a naked Arnold Schwarzenegger stares down at nighttime Los Angeles to the final moment where Sara Connor drives down a lonely road as a storm approaches, Cameron is always reaching for something better than what you usually get from this sort of action flick.<br/><br/>The Terminator didn't just help create one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history. It's one of the foundations of the modern sci-fi action genre. It's one of those films that help you appreciate just how good movies can be. It's a classic."

Effective blend of cold-blooded, hard-edged violence and surprisingly sensitive human interest; the characterizations may not be deep, and the paradoxes don't warrant scrutiny, but it's so fast-paced and well-made that such quibbles aren't worth worrying about.

","Terminator 2 has always been in my top 5 favourite movies of all time, however, over time my apreciation for James Cameron's first film has grown massively. This movie balances a very personal story with end of the world stakes, superbly well. Kyle Reese (Michael Bhien) is a very well written character, his motivations are set up nicely and his development throughout the movie is really Interesting. The Idea of Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) character and what she means is so amazingly interestingand it really gets your brain going, which is a problem with movies today. The 80s time period in which this film was made, and obviously set, feels so fitting to the story. The monster that is the Terminator, played off course by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is simply terrifying. A big beefy man that is a machine designed to kill immediately creates this sense of nervousness. When you're watching this film you have this feeling to look over your shoulder, almost like It Follows (2014) does. Every action scene is gripping and feels haunting. The score by Brad Fiedel feels very dated at times and is kinda goofy but the main theme remains one of my favourites. This film to me did so many things for the first time in cinema history and doesn't get the credit somerhing like say Star Wars does. The Terminator is one of my all time favourites and really deserves appreciation."
"AhmedSpielberg99","8","2","3","9 October 2018"," Unpretentious filmmaking at its finest!
","In regards of every single aspect, The Terminator is the textbook example of just how much can be done with as little money.<br/><br/>With a simple, yet innovative use of camera movements, and different camera angles, James Cameron shot some of the most impressive action sequences and car chases. The use of zooming technique, in particular, in chases scenes also created a great deal of tension.<br/><br/>Simply put, The Terminator is one of the best paced action movies ever. It's not fast as most of the cheesy action flicks of the eighties, nor slow-burning like Blade Runner's that definitely wouldn't suit the movie's tone. It's just perfect!<br/><br/>Some may say the special effects are dated and don't hold up very well, but I don't mind them at all. In fact, I liked so much the visual effects, and I found them pretty convincing. The makeup is also remarkable for its time.<br/><br/>What dazzles me aren't the effect, though, but the not-a-word-wasted dialogue. There is no line of dialogue that has been wasted. Every line or even gesture is as short as it's powerful as you can ever imagine.<br/><br/>The movie isn't without its flaws, though. I found the way we got to know for the first time about the background story pretty lazy. Also, the whole situation was unsuitable for giving us information, but, nonetheless, the time was perfectly enough for us to know the most important things. There were also a couple of times later when the luck played a vital role in saving the protagonist's life. Besides, there is a glaring plot hole at the end of the movie that really drove me crazy till the credits roll.<br/><br/>The movie features Arnold Schwarzenegger in his career-defining role, and I can easily see why. Casting him was a perfect choice to portray a relentless, rigid, indestructible cyborg. From seeing her vulnerable to accepting her fate, and trying to convince herself of it, Linda Hamilton is absolutely terrific as Sarah Connor. Michael Biehn is fantastic as well. Kyle Reese is my favorite character from the movie.<br/><br/>A great score that just hits the right note by walking a fine line between the bleakness of the post-apocalyptic world and the cheesiness that distinguishes the movie's nature.<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"

","The original ""Terminator"" is arguably the greatest sci-fi/action film ever, and the Special Edition DVD finally does this classic film justice. In the future, SkyNET, the supercomputer in control of all military power, decides that humans must be destroyed and begins a massive nuclear war that destroys most of the population. The survivors form a resistance against the computer and its mechanical army, and eventually defeat it, thanks to their leader John Connor. In a final effort to win, the computer sends a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, before he is born. The humans send back a lone soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah from the seemingly unstoppable cyborg. I think what's so great about this movie is how you're slowly revealed the true form of the Terminator. Piece by piece he loses a chunk here, a chunk there. You know he's a machine with flesh over his endo-skeleton, but the full force of this implication isn't really felt until you see the machine without the flesh emerge from burning wreckage. I find the scene where the endo-skeleton is lurching very quickly toward the door as Sarah is struggling to close it far more terrifying than the whole Terminator apocalypse scenes in the sequels. But then again, those are action movies.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is first rate. Fantasy II's future sequences and Stan Winston's make-up and Terminator endo-skeletons are some of the finest moments in Science Fiction film making. Even in this day and age of CG-everything, the rear projected, stop motion animated Terminator effects are still very good, standing up well in the light of eighteen years of technological innovation. Additionally, for the special edition DVD they redid some of the sound effects, like the Terminator's long-slide .45. There are lots of extras, including deleted scenes, still galleries, and two interview reels with Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, plus Biehn and Hamilton.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"retrorenegade","9","2","3","24 April 2016"," Let's Cut The Chase: This Film Is Fantastic!
","In order to properly appreciate The Terminator, you have to look at this film and take into consideration the budget that it was made on and the status of the director who created it. Before this film, James Cameron was not the king of the world like he was after Titanic and Avatar broke through. He was a person who very little people had faith in with a film idea that didn't go over very well among the top studios. And if you look at this film from a technical point of view, you can see that they were being conservative with the budget for a bizarre science fiction premise created by a struggling filmmaker who nobody really had much faith in. But in the end, it turned out to be a very good movie with real heart and soul, exciting and suspenseful action, an interesting if unlikely plot, and great performances from Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.<br/><br/>But what about Arnold Schwarzenegger? Well, Arnold is unique in this film since he is not really a character in the traditional sense. He is more of an obstacle; a force of nature that cannot be stopped that haunts the protagonists with his fierce demeanor and acute focus on his main mission: to murder Sarah Connor. There is an intensity to his presence on-screen, no small part do to Brad Fiedel's excellent score which includes a foreboding metallic heartbeat every time the Terminator walks onto the scene. And fascinatingly enough, his ""character"" as the Terminator encompasses a very dark fantasy of man: the ability to do anything to anyone without any consequences or anyone being able to stop you.<br/><br/>The movie hits all the right notes! It starts with a disastrous view of the future before jumping into a dark, disturbing view of the present, with the gritty, dirty streets of nighttime LA providing the perfect setting for a suspenseful chase between man and a murderous machine. It gives us a glimpse of lighthearted humanity as we see Sarah Connor, and ordinary young woman living her life as a normal person, before we are thrown into her nightmare as she finds herself stalked by an unknown assailant with an unknown cause. We feel sympathy for her as she finds herself not only in physical danger but facing the emotional crisis of having the responsibility of saving humanity in the future. And we feel for Kyle Reece, the soldier sent from the future to protect her against impossible odds, as we see him trying to operate in a world that he does not know after growing up in the wake of nuclear destruction. Even the minor characters feel real and human. The only thing ""wooden"" about the acting in the movie would be from Arnold himself, but that's okay because his character is supposed to be a lifeless, emotionless killing machine - and he excels at his role as the Terminator in that way.<br/><br/>But despite how much I love this movie (I even love it more than Terminator 2: Judgement Day, believe it or not), I can't ignore the fact that certain elements of the film have not aged well at all! Chase scenes that were filmed and sped up to look faster, choppy stop-motion animations on the Terminator endoskeleton, and prosthetic animatronics with plastic skin are just a few examples of how this film shows its age and its low budget. Setbacks like this can take modern moviegoers out of the experience simply because a lot of the special effects look incredibly dated compared to other films, even films that came before this movie like Return of the Jedi. <br/><br/>However, in the end, this film comes across as James Cameron's true labor of love. This isn't the blockbuster high-budget mega production Titanic or Avatar. This is the film that got his name well known among the movie-making industry. This was his equivalent to Spielberg's Jaws or Lucas' Star Wars: a film that was so hard to make, but you can see he poured his heart into, and it paid off! You have to respect something like that!<br/><br/>Just watch this film! Do it! Do it now! Go! Leave this review and find a copy of The Terminator and watch it!"

Schwartzenegger as the Terminator is a terrifying villain who is fixed on a relentless pattern but is also volatile.<br/><br/>Hamilton particularly gives a memorable performance.

","Arnold Schwarzenegger brings presence, intensity and menace in James Cameron's futuristic sci fi nightmare. James Cameron really showed his talents as not only a writer, but as a film maker in this classic. The story is fluent, the pace is frantic and is grounded by excellent direction, great performances and good dialogue. The tone of the film is dark and its ambiance is amped up by Brad Fiedel's ominous and percussive score. Stan Winston's special make up f/x are top notch. While Arnold as The Terminator is a focal point and in this role he is perfect, it would be criminal to overlook the rest of the cast in this picture. Michael Biehn gave an exceptional, intense balls out performance here and carries the story delivering exposition while being chased by The Terminator. Linda Hamilton is great too. She shows a lot of range in this film. Lance Hendrickson and Paul Winfield give brief, but memorable performances as cops. There also are some cool cameos from Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punk rockers. This movie is a solid production and holds up well. I am not much of a fan of the sequels. T2 is clearly the best of the lot, but after that James Cameron is no longer in the mix and from that point on continuity and quality drop."
"caseynicholson","10","2","3","26 August 2015"," Superb in Every Way!
","I have a soft spot in my heart for this film, as it's one that I would watch over and over and over again on VHS with my Dad when I was a kid. <br/><br/>Back then the fun of the movie was all in the basic gist of the action scenes and the scariness of Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. Now that I'm all grown up, I appreciate this movie for its being so very well-crafted. For a lot of folks, it's the film's sequel, ""T2: Judgement Day"" that is the memorable blockbuster movie, and I loved T2 when it came out myself. But I really think that the original is the better film overall. It's the perfect blend of sci-fi and horror--many of the scenes could work well with an 80's slasher movie. <br/><br/>And yet the film is more than just sci-fi, and certainly more than just horror. It's an engaging tale that makes us care about the characters--even John Connor, who hasn't even been born yet. Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor is fantastic, and the on-screen chemistry between Sarah and Kyle adds to the depth of the film.<br/><br/>The thing that I think I like most about this movie is its simplicity. Perhaps by 1984 standards ""The Terminator"" may have been groundbreaking in terms of effects, and I'm sure that the robotic Terminator was a convention that not many people had seen done in such a way at that time. Still, the effects are archaic by today's standards, adding a simplistic feel to the movie. <br/><br/>But more important is the fact that the script and the storytelling of the film work in just the right way. This isn't a movie that tries to do too much, even though its narrative would have invited that. The film gives you just enough information about the future world from which its villain has come. The restraint used to make an otherwise very complicated tale into one that is accessible to the audience is what makes this movie so clever. Its pacing, its dialogue, and its script all are simple--and yet they come together into a robust tale that draws you in and makes for a completely enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>That said, it's not often that I give a film 10/10 stars, but I feel obliged to for ""The Terminator"". It tells its story in a way that feels perfect, and in so doing leaves us with much to appreciate. It's a truly excellent film."
"Rawal_Afzal","10","2","3","24 August 2015"," Gripping and entertaining!
","First of all, the background music is a killer, absolutely mind-blowing and amazingly fitting to the film.<br/><br/>As I wrote in my review for 'Aliens' (1986), I am quite reluctant to watch old films, however it was that film that convinced me that James Cameron is a man whose films transcend all such barriers and his works are meant for any era and are ever green. This has only added more to my belief and I am awe of this one as well. The best bit for me in the film has to be the ending scenes where the terminator had to be killed three times, of which the best was when he shows up for the third and the last time without legs. Assured that they can't get it wrong twice I thought him to be dead, as I shouted a loud ""Oh' my God!"" when he attacks them for the third time. His death was intelligently shown as a crushing from which he could never have recovered.<br/><br/>Personally though I had bit of a funny experience as, having watched 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991) I was influenced into thinking that here too Arnold Schwarzenegger would be the hero but scene after scene my expectations of a hero weren't being met and it was when he attacks Sarah Connor for the first time and the other guy saves her, it's that where I got things right. Hahaha!<br/><br/>All in all, the terminator film concept itself is one the most unique and worthy of appreciation. Clearly a work of a hugely capable and creative mind.<br/><br/>And once again, the background music is a beauty! I can listen to it again and again and never get bored. It has that touch of inspiring you and make you feel like that the war is real, or even better, that you are a part of it all."
"Tyson14","10","2","3","5 July 2015"," A classic
","The modern classics of science fiction have been able to infuse crowd- pleasing action scenes with truly thought-provoking and clever concepts. From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.<br/><br/>Sarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-'80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.<br/><br/>As the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right ""action-hero"" buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the ""tender moments"" last about three minutes in total.<br/><br/>With one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list."

","James Cameron delivers his first box office sensation starring the ultimate body-builder legend, Arnold Schwarzenegger in this classic 1980's technical science fiction action thriller. Its one of the coolest conceptual movies ever made taking place in a modern world that may or may not exist in the near future due to artificially intelligent machines deciding to strike back against mankind. Although, younger viewers will find some of the special effects a bit cheesy and dated, the plot is a concept that will define a whole new genre, and changed Americans' perspective of films forever. <br/><br/>Schwarzenegger is sheer perfection as a menacing futuristic cyborg sent back to the year 1984 in order to destroy the mother of an unborn resistance leader that will inevitably defeat the machines. The human resistance must counter-attack by sending a human being (Michael Biehn) back to the same year to protect the target (Linda Hamilton). This is slam-bang action from start to finish, and features an excellent cast and the innovative, ground-breaking genius of Stan Winston's blending of computer animation with mechanical prosthetic motion photography. A haunting musical score, clever script, tense mood and atmosphere contribute to the film's suspense, and a revealing climax that is the icing on the cake. Cameron's detailed vision is complex and engaging, and Hamilton, Biehn, Paul Winfield, and Lance Henrickson are all outstanding. Also features early performances by 80's up-comers Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, Dick Miller and more. This will also spawn the excellent ground-breaking sequel, T2: Judgement Day.

","It was interesting upon viewing this movie for the 5th time while keeping in mind the struggles that California was going through when Arnold first took office. I saw Sarah Connor as a Gray Davis figure, one who was unfairly hunted down by powerful enemies, for reasons out of her control. If you recall Gray Davis was the very unpopular governor of California during the electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001. He was unfairly blamed for the rolling blackouts in the state, when in fact Enron was to blame because they had a stranglehold on the power plants and were shutting them down, creating excess demand while diminishing the supply.<br/><br/>The Terminator is Enron, a seemingly unstoppable force hellbent on the destruction of its enemies. Like Enron, The Terminator does not play by the rules; it does anything it can to complete its objective.<br/><br/>But the powerful always fall. Enron flew too close to the sun and disintegrated when they could not keep up the facade any longer. The Terminator was destroyed when Sarah Connor lured him into a mechanical press. Although both Enron and The Terminator was defeated, the threat they posed still lingers. Corporate greed is still prevalent, as evidenced by the 2008 financial crisis. Banks and other financial institutions laid waste to the global economy, without sympathy for those whose lives they destroyed. The Terminator is a product of a future, possibly created by another, much more severe financial crisis that is looming over us. Terminators lay waste to everything, destroying the world and making it practically uninhabitable. If we do not learn from our mistakes, and continue to allow corporate greed to permeate throughout our society, big banks and the financial wizards of Wall Street will destroy this society without a second thought. Short-term profits always win out, without any regard for long-term sustainability."

The human resistance also sent back a soldier, however, in Kyle Reese, to fight the machine and help protect Sarah, John's mother. Kyle and Sarah must find a way to stop the unstoppable, and this robot will kill everyone and everything in order to complete his machine!<br/><br/>The film just basically depicts their fight against the Terminator, which is portrayed amazingly by Arnie and actually I do not believe any actor in the world could have portrayed the cold hearted machine better!

","The Terminator (James Cameron, 1984) It's easy to see how The Terminator put James Cameron on the map. Whether or not the story is entirely original (and of course, like maybe all sci-fi concepts, it's been done again and again, in the Doctor Who story Day of the Daleks just to name one example), the way Cameron put it all together is impressive. The storyline generates lots of genuine suspense, even when you know exactly what's going to happen, even when you know how it will happen. Linda Hamilton makes a great protagonist, her character arc developing quite believably given her performance. The special effects and the dialogue are sometimes a bit cheesy... but it was the Eighties, what can you do?<br/><br/>The chase/fight scenes are not overdone (unlike certain newer movies like Man of Steel and Pacific Rim). The sequence of the police psychologist interviewing Reese provides some welcome comic relief, as do a couple of other sequences here and there. Arnold Schwarzenegger's questionable acting abilities are actually put to good advantage: he plays a believable robot.<br/><br/>Overall I am pleased with The Terminator, which deserves its positive reputation as a force of pop culture. Solid piece of science fiction too.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor was just damn lucky she was listed as the last Sarah Connor in the phone book! 9/10"

"Hey_Sweden","10","2","3","3 November 2012"," A career highlight for Cameron and Schwarzenegger.
","Filmmaker James Cameron had already showed a real style and vision when working for Roger Corman's special effects and art department, also learning well how to shoot fast and on a low budget. Here his talent and experience paid off with this breakthrough film, truly a model action picture with its unflagging pace and intensity level. It moves forward quite well while also remaining coherent, telling an interesting story that owes a debt to not only the works of Harlan Ellison, as is credited at the end, but Michael Crichtons' ""Westworld"". Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a credible star performance as the title character, a cyborg sent to 1984 from the future by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. It wants to ensure that its primary human enemy, a man named John Connor, is never born, so the terminator is sent back in time to assassinate his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Fortunately, a protector for Sarah is also sent back, a sensitive soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). Reese will have his work cut out for him not only trying to keep Sarah alive, but convincing her that his wild sounding story is indeed reality. ""The Terminator"" has incredible atmosphere, in both its present and future scenes, and has some wonderful eye popping visuals, not to mention fantastic special effects work by Stan Winston. Brad Fiedel's music score is catchy and iconic, but sounds even more haunting and effective when it's done as a simple piano melody. The editing (by Mark Goldblatt), art direction (by George Costello), and cinematography (by Adam Greenberg) are all first rate. The movie does date itself in certain ways (fashion styles and music), but that merely adds to the appeal in this viewers' humble opinion. It's also not wall to wall action, as it takes some breathers here and there, and is really quite touching in some of its quieter moments. The casting is spot on all the way down the line. Schwarzenegger is perfect as the relentless killing machine, especially as the role doesn't require a lot of dialogue, the under-rated Biehn does a nice job of selling his character and the material, and appealing Hamilton does a fine job with her character arc as Sarah changes from being kind of a mousy person to being more take-charge. The excellent supporting cast features such reliable people as Lance Henriksen (who's a hoot), Paul Winfield, Rick Rossovich, and Earl Boen, and there are some wonderful bits for Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, and Dick Miller. Cameron and co-writer / producer Gale Anne Hurd inject the film with a decent dose of humour (such as the terminator cycling through various possible responses to a question) that never becomes too prevalent. ""The Terminator"" is simply one of the best films of its kind, and its impact on pop culture (including Arnolds' best known cinematic one-liner of them all) is undeniable. A must see for sci-fi and action lovers. Followed by three sequels and the 'Sarah Connor Chronicles' TV series. 10 out of 10."

Oops, wrong movie!"
"g_ryder","10","2","3","8 July 2012"," In the end the Terminator will triumph - that is the real terror of mankind
","The basic plot of the movie is that a highly sophisticated machine (The Terminator) with extraordinary physical powers that also looks like a human on the outside (Schwarzenegger) has been sent from the future to the present so that the machines can terminate the mother of the only person who can save the human species in the final war between humans and machines that rages in the future world. This is being done so that the 'savior of the human species' is never born, and with that done the machines of the future can win easily. The humans of the future come to know of this plan, and so they too send a human into the present time to stop the terminator from carrying out this plan. All the action revolves around this plot, and all the sequences are brilliantly choreographed, along with superb visual effects and dialogs. The role of Schwarzenegger is so perfectly fitting as 'The Terminator', that it is spooky. This has rightly earned him the nickname 'Terminator' of which he too is proud of. It is this spooky feeling that indicates that this is no simple sci-fi action movie, and that there runs beneath the surface theme of man versus machine, a more fundamental theme of life and death, of 'Eros' and 'Thanatos' than just action and adventure, and that is why this is a classic.<br/><br/>Coming to the abstract ideas behind the movie, the idea of 'time travel' is now well recognized as purely fictional and therefore serves as an artistic and imaginative prop or support for other ideas. The core abstract idea is that of an ongoing struggle between mankind and the destructive effects of the reckless use of technology, also unleashed by man, which going 'out of control' threatens the entire human species. So this is actually a metaphysical battle taking place within the human mind at the 'collective unconscious' (Jungian term) level. The 'archetypes' of 'savior' and 'terminator' are again props for this battle between those human minds that through their actions and creative expressions support the sustaining force of life, and those human minds that act mechanically and insensitively, and who by their actions support the 'life terminating' or 'death' force.<br/><br/>""Our technology has already outstripped our ability to control it."" Gen. Omar Bradley The key fact or the truth that is not apparent is that machines themselves are not players or 'beings' in this struggle, they are not entities that act themselves because they have no 'volition' or 'will' of any kind, rather machines are value neutral tools that are used either to create or to destroy. And since this core abstract idea cannot be presented or explained very explicitly, it has to take the art form of a movie like this one. (Also compare this to The Matrix). Thus 'The Terminator' is a powerful symbol of the ever increasing potential for destruction unleashed by technology that is bound to occur in the future - the event that can only be extended in time ( 'buying time') by the creative use of technology.<br/><br/>""Art is a lie that reveals the truth"" said Pablo Picasso. And the truth is that The Terminator will ultimately succeed in wiping out mankind because it is 'designed' or 'fated' to do so. This movie buys some more time for us by it's art."

","The Terminator is easily one of the best science fiction films released in the 1980's. Also one of James Cameron's best.This movie really jump-started Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career. He is such an underrated actor. He also did quite well in Predator, Total Recall and Terminator 2. In my opinion, his best film was Terminator 2. He is just a total bad-ass in this film. Unlike Terminator 2 and 3, his character is sent back to kill the mother of the leader of the human resistance. I the first two sequels, he is sent back to protect him from another Terminator sent back to kill him. Michael Beihn was amazing too. He plays his role very well. He really knows how to act. Linda Hamilton did a great job as well. She is one of the best actresses around. The Terminator is a milestone in science fiction."
"Steffi_P","9","2","3","8 November 2011"," ""A serious attitude problem""
","There has long been a tradition in cinema of actors whose good looks or sheer physicality far outstripped their Thespian talents. Of these Arnold Schwarzenegger is in a league of his own. His nickname of Austrian Oak seems to refer not just to his impressive stature but to his woodenness before the camera. And yet he became an icon in the 1980s by managing to get cast in parts which didn't stretch his disappointing range. What do you do with a monotonous voice and a body that looks like it could punch through concrete? You play a robot, that's what.<br/><br/>Oh, sorry, not a robot. A *cyborg*<br/><br/>Yes, the 1980s run of hi-octane sci-fi actioners was a boon for Schwarzenegger. The idea of some technological terror coming to get us was hardly new. It was the subject of a lot of 50s B-movies, and if you want to go back further you could include Frankenstein as well. The Terminator is essentially an update of these stories for the then-fledgling age of computers and robotics. It's not the best bit of writing ever. There is some woeful dialogue, and enough logical flaws in the plot to drive a juggernaut through, but this doesn't really matter because the screenplay only really exists to give us a thrilling action adventure. And the central premise – futuristic warriors battling it out over the life of a present day woman – provides a strong enough core to build any number of fight and chase scenes around.<br/><br/>The Terminator was the second feature of James Cameron, and he shows early on a skillful blending of terror and excitement. The picture moves fast, so he doesn't have much time to establish elements of horror, but he is adept at throwing something into the frame – such as the prominent window behind Linda Hamilton – to introduce a little note of uncertainty and danger. To maintain the pace, Cameron's tack is to keep the images constantly moving, not letting the tempo down even in quiet moments. After Arnie utters the immortal ""I'll be back"" line, we cut between near identical close-ups of the desk sergeant's paperwork – an utterly pointless bit of editing narrative-wise but it brilliantly ratchets up the tension before it all kicks off. Cameron also loves to make the audience feel involved, frequently placing us within the action. The first shot in the modern day has the camera underneath the jaws of a monstrous-looking digger. Often characters are seen advancing towards the retreating camera. It's worth remembering that Cameron was of the first generation of filmmakers to be influenced by video games. Not that earlier directors hadn't used these techniques, but I think that idea of feeling like a participant in the action really helped shape his approach.<br/><br/>The movie looks neat too despite what was a relatively low budget for the era and genre. They have really gone to town on all the tropes of the 80s action movie – dry ice, blue lightning and alleyways full of billowing newspapers and homeless people. In a way, that contrast between piercing white light and smoky shadow was the 80s equivalent of chiaroscuro lighting. Very often of course it is hiding the clunkiness of the special effects, which are strictly old-school. Personally I love the movie's pre-CGI charm. This really was a golden age for animatronics, even as they were becoming obsolete.<br/><br/>So, where does Mr Schwarzenegger fit into all this? With The Terminator we have a movie where fast-paced action runs roughshod over logic, and it doesn't call for amazing dramatic performances. Look at the other players – Linda Hamilton is passable but not amazing, and Michael Biehn is dreadful to the point of irritating. Outside of this movie, both Hamilton and Biehn were better actors than Schwarzenegger, but here it is Arnie who is the most compelling and watchable, simply because playing a hard, mechanical killing machine is the one thing he could do really well. Just for once, he gets to be convincing, chilling, the captivating heart of the movie. Good for him."

Meanwhile, the Resistance leader John Connor has been sent back in time to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor. The Terminator is so invincible he can't be defeated by a normal human being and that is what makes the odds of surviving so impossible. The constant brawls and the scenes were Sarah Connor and John Connor are trying to escape is what makes the film so enjoyable to watch; Hope, Fear and all-around action not to mention Arnold's one-liners. I mean, a futuristic robot from the past, come on? What's not to like?.<br/><br/>*Spoilers Part* I'm trying to make sense of the scenes were time-travel is involved using my imagination. First off, they can narrow down a date but not the house number so this leads the Terminator and John Connor to using a phone-book to find the correct house. Although, both sides still have the time machine only one solid and con-jointed object is allowed to pass through otherwise the molecules will get scrambled together. The human resistance invented the time machine first but an evil scientist managed to create his prototype into a real time machine by stealing the plans for it. He then managed to capture a dead robot, update him and use him to go through the time machine. They can't send robots and resistance fighters through one-by-one because there is a malfunction in the time machine system were you can't send the robot or person back to the same year that the time machine has already been to. <br/><br/>Phew, that was a lot but see how much more fun it is when you use your imagination?."

","A dismal future seems to await mankind. Machines, including elaborate killer robots, have taken over the earth. There is, however, a small band of human survivors who are trying to regain control of the planet. They are doing rather well at this, on a small scale. So much so, that the machines send one of the best lethal robots (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to bump off a lady, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). This is because Ms. Connor is destined to have a son, John, who will become a great leader of the resistance. Guessing what is afloat, the humans send back their own time traveler, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to prevent this tragedy from happening. When the robot gets to 1984 Los Angeles, he grabs a phone book. Inside is a listing of three Sarah Connors and their addresses. Methodically, Arnold Robot guns down the first two. But, the one remaining Sarah is the one he learns he really wants. Meanwhile, Kyle shadows Sarah around, for he doesn't even know what the killer machine looks like and has to wait for the robot to make the first move. Hiding in a bar, Sarah knows something is up, having seen the news of the deaths already. Happily, Kyle rescues her at the last minute. From then on, there is an on-the-run fight to defeat and destroy the robot and no surety that the humans will do so. From parking garages, tunnels, motels, cabins, and factories, the terminator does not stop in its pursuit of its prey. Who will win? This film is terminally thrilling and terminally fascinating. It may very well be Cameron's best work, even including Avatar, Titanic, Aliens and others. As the killing machine, Arnold is absolutely perfect, cold, calculating, and more, moving stiffly like a robot would. Kudos, Arnold. Hamilton and Biehn are also quite good while the supporting cast, including Paul Winfield, backs them up nicely. The sets are fantastic, from the futuristic ones to the settings in Los Angeles. Ditto for the special effects, which are way ahead of their time. Moreover, the script is a stunning science fiction masterpiece while Cameron's direction has a relentless pace, pausing briefly for tender moments and, yes, romance.

","Given that the world can take this movie completely for granted now, one can forget how gradually Cameron unravels what's happening with the two nude men who emerge one night from a torrent of voltage: One, a colossal Germanic beast, dispatches of a crew of punks to obtain their clothes first thing after he instantaneously regains his orientation. Those clothes, incidentally, should definitely not fit the much massive man, but that's merely one of a goodly figure of plot cavities that I only ever note after it's over: Like several ambitious thriller directors before him, Cameron reveals an exceptional skill at sustaining the action so summarily that this or that inconsistent detail doesn't matter. The second nude, Michael Biehn, doesn't have the same massive figure or imperviousness, but he has the vigilance and taut physique of an animal, stealing clothes too, managing to pinch a gun.<br/><br/>By this stage we're beginning to note that this smaller man may not entirely be so formidable like the other, as he's conspicuously not killed anyone yet, but we still don't understand how any of it relates to the opening title card describing a war between humans and machines, or why both men have such a concern with the three Sarah Conners in the metro area phone book. It swiftly becomes clear to us which of the three is the one who counts, as we meet her in the form of Linda Hamilton. We see how tedious her life is, with her co-worker observing, in what we don't yet recognize is irony, that in 100 years, nobody will care. Then Sarah finds on the news that someone with precisely her name has been viciously murdered. Thinking little about it, she arranges for a night out with her roommate Ginger while the LAPD, led by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen, have to manage the second execution-style killing of a Sarah Connor in one day.<br/><br/>We still don't know what's happening, theoretically at least: We saw the giant man murder the initial Sarah, we're not familiar with the second, and neither man has yet verified himself as trustworthy the slightest bit. So when the smaller man manages to begin stalking our Sarah, we've every cause to presume that he's trouble, and so does she, having by now gathered the murders lead straight to her. She dodges into an ascetically '80s club to call the police and disappear. Two presumably deadly, anonymous, wordless men hunt the same woman in the packed nightspot. At least one now has a substantial arsenal. Eventually, half hour in, one says his very first line of dialogue: ""Come with me if you want to live."" With hero and villain now conclusively determined, the movie's remainder is utterly a chase, Schwarzenegger pursuing the two humans through LA, slaughter and nothing else on his agenda. I remain unendingly stunned by how superbly Cameron sustains the tension: Unquestionably in that first half hour, there's not one second that's missing heart and soul, when even the essential exposition of Sarah's life is managed with utmost effectiveness. Even in the enormous info-dumps that Biehn is burdened with, we have no sense of the film slumping under the load of it all. When he bothers to tell Sarah, and us, the plot in essence, it comes directly after a climactic point, when we're viscerally prepared for the film to let us decompress.<br/><br/>There's the cost-conscious way that Cameron shares information about Biehn and Schwarzenegger, ensuring that we'll be engrossed in deciphering who they are. The sharp-witted strokes characterizing Sarah, making her so authentic that we viscerally crave her survival until he can bother to show us just why we should be particularly concerned. Sarah as a convincing, appealing person is much due to Hamilton playing a young woman of no seeming significance pushed into a nightmare and never permitted to find her balance. This is usually the part that feels like just a bookmark, but Hamilton emphasizes her uncommonly distinctive sense of a woman in an '80s killer-stalking-girl flick.<br/><br/>Biehn, never my favorite actor, nevertheless seems a sinewy, astute beast as much as a human. It evokes the frantic anguish of his future life, and makes us pity this tattered endurer. Meanwhile, the epically iconic rogue of the film: It takes authority, and in Schwarzenegger's case, a grand succession of close-mouthed expressions, tweaks of the head. He may be a machine, but he's a convincing one. It's a categorically star-making performance.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Adam Greenberg encapsulates a grimy, murky world, scattered by overpowering fluorescents. Stan Winston's Terminator endoskeleton is the stuff of legend, even if some of the animatronics in certain shots are charmingly old-fashioned. Of all the collaborators, still, it's composer Brad Fiedel that merits the most affection: His throbbing, techno-flavored theme leads one of the finest film scores throughout all the 1980s, and it's maybe the best instrument Cameron has to use in maintaining the film's propulsion. It's exciting, dissonant and harsh, that unremitting bass line keeping the movie seeming like it'll never brake, not unless the menace is quelled. Cameron's assurance in his material brings his debut far beyond the standard of all the other films where the screenplay is merely a cause for explosions and car chases: It's a plot with import and desperate interests. Though the characters may be standards, they have persona, and their future is an issue of sincere apprehension."

","Hard to believe that James Cameron started out with something as small budgeted as The Terminator, and now he has directed the two highest grossing films of all time. Today a lot of people hate James Cameron because he has mediocre stories mixed in with amazing special effects, where as 30 years ago he brought us a very well done story about how technology may overthrow the human race one day.<br/><br/>Now a few things I didn't like in this movie, it is a little bit slow, if you are very impatient you may not like this movie, but if you can get pass the slower parts you will find a really fun flick. I don't see why they couldn't just wrap laser guns in a piece of meat, I didn't see much purpose in following the police chief, he doesn't have much impact on the story, and it can be very depressing at times, and would have been nice to have a little more comic relief.<br/><br/>I love stories that try to warn us about how we can mess up the future, either by government or technology. This film applies more today than it did back in 1984 now that we have Internet, cell phones, iPods and all that. The special effects are excellent, and this movie had a very low budget. The action scenes are good, but nothing groundbreaking, they get the story moving, but they're nothing special. And the characters are all interesting, weather you like James Cameron or not, you can't deny he knows how to make a strong female lead, and Sarah Conner is one of them. She starts out as a waitress who can't even do her job right, then becomes a bada** near the end.<br/><br/>The Terminator is one of the best examples of how to make a film on a low budget. Both the story, and the special effects are great, the characters are interesting, and it's just a fun movie to watch. It's got a great look to it, and warns us how technology may turn on us one day."

","Here is the real thing. This is the reason I went to see a sci-fi movie when I usually don't...The Terminator starring a young Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was mean and he was huge. He seamed unstoppable!! He was frightening, at very least. As I watched a low-budgeted extravaganza film, I had an altogether different emotional connection with a movie by the ending credits. The feeling of actually being in this, while I sat in a dark theater. The pounding score set the feel of the story. I swear my heart was in my throat. Horror and terror films should take note as to the effect that the Terminator had on my central nervous system. No 'pretty people' like newer movies and Television, just a concrete in your scared-face, movie event of the summer type of deal. That doesn't come from teenagers and early twenties with perfect hair and designer wardrobes, and the new MTV song-score of the most popular group or individual. I saw the terminator coming and destroying almost everything in his path. He did not feel pain, or remorse and he was 'Programmed' for just one thing ...kill john Connor. Sending a much smaller, even though he was strong, soldier back through time to protect Sarah, was interesting too. Michael Beihn, the military man that volunteered for the job was a cool and kind of guy, with a sort of numbness in his mode of operation. He was trained,smarter and faster, and still, he seemed like he was nothing for this mighty emotionless, murdering cyborg, that had a mission to bring down the entire human race.<br/><br/>I was astounded, in high school when I first saw this film. I was very impressed as to the quality in a story from a low budgeted film. The special effects man Stan Winston was part of the saving grace of this feature. By him the story really became more three dimensional by his expert eye and ability to make real that which is not. I believe that low budget miracle films are amazing to the whole spectrum of the entertainment world. It's that freedom that allows the film makers to get something off-of-the-ground that might be stalled out in a big production studio, otherwise. So I say three cheers for the very mechanical and powerfully mastered Terminator. James Cameron has done a magnificent work with this sci-fi wild ride, that ends with many thoughts and emotions. (****) A MOVIE SIDE NOTE: The original choice for this movie to play the terminator was Not Arnold...it was set to be 'Shot' with O.J. Simpson, he was gonna take a 'stab' at Action -drama film, but that changed before production."

","The explosive sci-fi thriller that turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a superstar is now acknowledged as a cult classic, but it's certainly worth remembering that it did only modest business at the box office. Nevertheless, big Arnie hasn't gone hungry since.<br/><br/>The plot line of an unstoppable killer robot has become one of the most overused concepts in sci-fi cinema, but director James Cameron has imbued the film with plenty of wit and a relentless sense of pace. Even with today's standards, the make-up effects and the prosthetics are just as terrifyingly effective as they were in 1984. However, this is much more than the usual guns-blazing action B-movie: at the heart of the story lies a woman's reluctance to come to terms with what she must soon face, and the tragedy of a love that can never be."
"Gotensive","10","2","3","2 November 2008"," One of the best movies ever
","This movie is so great that I can't even begin to comprehend as to why it's not rated higher here on IMDb. It's a dark, gritty, relentlessly entertaining Sci-Fi Horror movie that features terrific performances all-around, a chilling score, and Arnold as the unstoppable villain. The special effects were very impressive for it's time, especially considering the budget. This movie has so many memorable & creepy scenes like the police station shoot-out, the scene where The Terminator is repairing his eye and arm, hell the beginning where he kills the punk teenagers is creepy as hell, especially upon first viewing since you have no idea what it actually is. Anyway, in my opinion this movie alone already established James Cameron as a genius, but then he made a equally great sequel. It gets a 10/10 from me, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all-time."

As the droid draws nearer and nearer to Sarah and Kyle,and the body count rises,an adrenaline-pumping,gut-wrenching battle between Man's last best hope and a killing machine who""has no pity,no conscience,cannot be bargained with and will not stop until it finds and terminates its target(I'm paraphrasing here somewhat)"" chugs toward fruition.<br/><br/>I learned not too long ago that director and co-writer James Cameron had NOT planned a sequel(let alone a trilogy or series)of this film and intended it to be a singular ending. Looking back at it as a whole product,it makes more sense(and that's all I'm saying from there so as to avoid any spoilers for those out there who HAVEN'T seen this film or aren't at least familiar with it). I can both understand why this film was only a marginal success when it was first released in late Fall/early Winter 1984: much of the cast were somewhat unknowns at the time,save Paul Warfield(As a doubting yet humane cop) and,of course,bodybuilding champ Schwarzenegger,and the concepts and images of the film were pure Sci-Fi,which always seems to be a bit of a hard sell to the general public. But much like another movie released around the same time,A Nightmare on Elm Street,it was a fairly unique and inexorably memorable movie that was bound to not only have sequels made but practically change the face of the genres they were made in. It's sequels are both well made(and I actually appreciated the whole size and scope of it's 1991 sequel,T2;Judgement Day somewhat better,the best of all three),and I intend to catch the next in the series,should it be made. Since Arnold vowed he was not doing any more movies as long as he's in public office,that could be a while. Still,it took almost twenty years to continue the simple storyline of man's battle with machines who've become far too powerful over just THREE movies,so what's another twenty years? It very well may be back."

","Arnold Schwarzenegger has made an impact on the big screen. First, there was the first two ""Conan"" movies, now here's one that will be a true classic of his, ""The Terminator"". The Terminator is a stoic killing machine that its purpose is to ""terminate"" its target. This cyborg, is very determined and nothing can stop him. Until one man from the future named Reese(Michael Biehn) who went after the cyborg to stop him. The Terminator seems to be more ruthless than any criminal of any class.

However, The Terminator got to a few wrong Sarah Connors. The first one, was a mother one bullet to the head was bad enough, did he have to totally ambush her? The action is so non-stop there, the gunshots, the car chases, and the plots keeps getting better by the minute. I liked the scene where the truck get taken and Reese takes out the truck with the bomb. I've enjoyed this movie straight out, there's so much to say about it, but I'll just let you see it for yourself. 5 Stars"
"Bogmeister","10","2","3","7 August 2005"," Relentless and Unstoppable, all you need is Love
","An instant classic, The Terminator succeeds on so many levels, it's still a benchmark with which to test other films, whether they be science fiction, action thriller, horror, romance or even comedy. We begin with the title character himself, uh, itself, essayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. No one can deny this film has a sense of humor when you first see Arnold strolling in the nude toward a trio of punks. Keep in mind, these are the sort of punks you hope you never run across at night, but, in the next moment, you feel nothing but sympathy for them and now Arnold is the source of a kind of horror. It unbalances an audience (seeing this for the first time) but it's done with such confidence, such smooth panache, you're caught helplessly in the undertow of this film's wild yet controlled progression.<br/><br/>You're with Arnold, and Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton, and you're overwhelmed by how the story unfolds, presenting concepts of a dark, ugly future while the action gets better & better with each scene. One should realize at this time, over 20 years later, that a good portion of the audience had no idea that Arnold was a robot (ok, cyborg) for the first half hour of the picture when it was first released. To them, unless they read a secret paragraph in a sci-fi magazine, Arnold was just a creepy human killer from the future. This was just another brilliant stroke by writer-director Cameron who, forced into creative decisions by a low budget, transcended all expectations of what a sci-fi B-movie should be. The script never lets us down as far as the Terminator character - it continually proves to be as Biehn describes it - remorseless & unstoppable. The story fools the viewers not once but twice by massacres which happen in places designated 'safe' (the disco and, more so, the police station). By the end, you're as exhausted as Linda Hamilton.<br/><br/>When the film veers towards the romance, it's not at all awkward, it's inevitable from the desperate circumstances. Like two souls trapped in a war only they understand, the time-crossed lovers seem thrown together by cosmic forces outside their control. We all seem to sense their time together will be brief, very brief - it's both a very touching and intense moment. In the end, the film proves to be flawless in execution - every scene works and builds on the previous scene. It's astounding how many things could have gone wrong, such as Arnold's rumored initial role as the hero. Hell, this even has Dick Miller selling guns. You can't go wrong there."
"SmithWinston","10","2","3","31 May 2005"," More than meets the eye
","For me this will always be the best of the Terminator films. The second is a great action film, the third is a popcorn flick. But this, the first of them, covers everything that the premise promises. The future, the present, and the strangeness of the laws that might govern time-travel (if it were at all possible). Kyle Reese is a great protagonist alongside Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. She is very natural and her reactions to the situation she finds herself in are spot on. Biehn's Reese comes off very well too, his calm and collected behaviour in the face of the Terminator shows how much he must be used to such a menace in the time he comes from.<br/><br/>The action in the police station is justifiably legendary. The fact that Arnold's Terminator doesn't break a sweat when breaking into the well-guarded police headquarters and killing so many officers, really manages to drive home the point of what the terminator is. That's in case Reese's previous explanations about the machine didn't convince you. Lance Henriksen turns in a great performance as a real oddball of a character, just over-the-top enough to be plausible. Adding to the realism, this comic relief is taken out during the shoot-out at the police station. Just goes to show that no one is safe from the Terminator.<br/><br/>Like Blade Runner, it's surprising how much better executed this film is compared to the CGI-fests that have taken over the cinema nowadays. The oldies hold up incredibly well in the comparison. The sparse scenes depicting the future are well-handled and the sets in no way detract from the authenticity generated. This film just oozes atmosphere, with it's bluish lights, dark future, and dark streets of the present with tube lights everywhere that throw long shadows. And of course Brad Fiedel's minimalist electronic score captures the mood and everything else perfectly. The musical motifs for the unstoppable terminator and the comparably feeble resistance offered by Reese are all present even in the main theme. I for one never get tired of hearing the same tune repeated throughout the movie, which at one point manages to morph into the love theme.<br/><br/>It's a shame that Cameron didn't stick to making such films as this and Aliens (which is almost as entertaining, though for very different reasons). Titanic, which set out to be a romance, fell far short of it because it was the romance aspect that felt staged throughout. With the Terminator, James Cameron achieves a great balance between menacing action, a believable romance and comedic timing. Perhaps he should return to making films that don't aim for a love story, but end up having one as a by-product. Let's hope we can all put the disaster that was the Titanic behind us and look forward to films of a similar calibre to his earlier works. Regardless of whatever else he does, I'll always be grateful to him for the first of the Terminator movies."

","This has got to be one of the best sci fi films ever made, and possibly the most influential ever! And not to mention one of the milestones and pop cultural phenomenal sensations of the 1980s, and perhaps one of James Cameron's best work, and to the say the least, the movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star, and this is perhaps the most memorable role and most recognizable role yet. And Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen and Dick Miller were also good here too, even though their roles were short(may Winfield rest in peace). Even though there were no special effects or CGI(they used stop motion instead. Oh those were the days) but you got to love this, once you've watched it, you'll fall in love with it and would want to watch it over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again and again and again, oh I'll stop right there.

"michael-fallaize","10","2","3","14 January 2005"," Fantastic film - Arnie at his best
","I absolutely love this film - the first time I saw it, I was about eight and I found it immensely scary watching people being hunted down by the ultimate cold, ruthless killing machine. Looking back the special effects weren't that great but at the time it seemed all too real. I think the second and third films lost their way in the sense that the 'baddies' weren't scary (with the exception of Robert Patricks eyes) and too much humour was injected.<br/><br/>While the debates continue about Johns age throughout the trilogy, I'd just like to point out the other time ""mistake"" in case some of you aren't aware of it. At the start of the film it stats that it's L.A. 1984. When Reece struggles with the policeman he asks what day it is to which the reply is ""12th May Thursday"" - the 12th of May was actually a Saturday......."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","2","3","6 July 2003"," This movie didn't even need two spectacular sequels (so far) to be great.
","The original Terminator is an extremely rare breed of science fiction film. It holds a spot in the memory and the imagination because it is so unique (which is a rarity these days, especially in science fiction), original, and intelligent (also a rarity). I have always had an almost unconditional love for movies that involve time travel, just because I find it to be such an interesting topic, but the time travel in The Terminator actually takes up relatively little of the overall storyline. Obviously, time travel is what makes the entire movie possible, but the plot itself focuses on Sarah Connor escaping from the brutally relentless terminator.<br/><br/>After the terminator and Kyle Reese arrive back in 1984 early in the movie, really the only thing that time travel has to do with the story is that we know what the future will be like if the terminator is not stopped. Occasionally there are flashes into the future (mostly in Reese's nightmares), but for the most part the movie takes place in the present (well, 20 years ago now), where Sarah is fighting against an unkillable killer while trying to comprehend her role in the bleak future.<br/><br/>
Arnold Schwarzenegger portrays the terminator with a stolidity and mechanical determination that only he can provide, setting the stage for many different things that would become traditional in the next two movies. Even the film score remains one of the most memorable film scores in film history, right up there with Star Wars, Halloween, and Robocop (come on, you remember the one from Robocop! It goes like this - Dun dun DUN dun der NER, dun dun DUN dun derrrrr, dun dun DUN dun DER NER nerrrrr.Remember now?).<br/><br/>
The go-motion photography that is used to animate the metallic terminators renders their motion jerky and unreal, but keep in mind that this is 1984, before the age of computer animation. Even with the early special effects, the metal terminators themselves are so menacing and original that they secure themselves immediately a spot among the most recognizable figures in film history.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn have a perfect chemistry onscreen, and it's interesting to watch their relationship blossom as we gradually realize that he's John Connor's father. One of the things that I've always loved about The Terminator movies are the subtleties that you can catch in the plot if you watch closely. There are definitely two timelines going on here, one in the present and one in the distant future, and you can learn a lot about them and how they're related by the things that the characters say.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed with the relationship between Reese and Sarah, because even Reese does not know that he is John Connor's father (and it's a good thing he is, too, because if it was someone else he could have seriously jeopardized the future of humankind by having sex with her!). Time travel involves a lot of paradoxes, such as in Back to the Future II, when Marty and Doc go to the year 2015 to save Marty's family from destruction, but if Marty and Jennifer are taken out of 1985 to go to 2015, they are no longer in 1985 to grow into the older ones that they find in 2015. This movie seems to have found a way around that, at least if you don't look TOO closely.<br/><br/>Reese volunteered for the mission back to 1984 to stop the Terminator from killing John Connor, not knowing at the time (and Connor also not knowing) that if he hadn't volunteered Connor would never have been born. Maybe a coincidence, or maybe this is still fate working for them. Connor was born BECAUSE Reese volunteered, so maybe it's not coincidence but cause and effect. At any rate, the necessary facts are there. John Connor never met his father and doesn't know who he is, and neither does Reese. The only thing either of them know is that he dies before the war. At this point you should remind yourself that not only is this a science fiction movie, but it's a science fiction movie made in the 80s. This is VERY well written.<br/><br/>Another small detail that I really liked about the movie is that Reese gives Sarah a picture of her that John Connor had given him to take back so he'd recognized her (this is something that NONE of the terminators in all 3 movies (so far) were provided with, by the way), and he tells her that he studied every line and every detail about the picture, and always wondered what she was thinking about when the picture was taken. At the end of the movie, we find out.<br/><br/>The movie kind of gets around the Back to the Future II problem in that, even though Reese is killed in 1984, he can still exist in the future to be sent back by John Connor. Unlike Marty McFly, He was born in the future and sent back to the past, so his death in the past does not change his existence in the future. And besides that, we can still have a sequel to the movie because Sarah ultimately killing the Terminator sent back to kill her does not win the war, it just prevents the total eradication of humans, so we're basically back to where we started.<br/><br/>The other thing that comes to mind here is that, in order for neither John or Reese to know who John's father is, Sarah has to die before the war. She survives in T2, but I have a feeling that Linda Hamilton turning down a role in T3 has something to do with he character dying between T2 and T3. But hey, even that fits perfectly into the story.<br/><br/>As we learn in Terminator 2, the machines haven't lost because of the T-101's failure to kill Sarah Connor in T1, they just need to try something else. And as we learn in Terminator 3 (I may be about to spoil part of that movie too, so stop reading if you haven't seen it!), it is not the massive destruction of humanity that they are seeking to stop, because that can't be stopped at all. It is, instead, the resistance of humans that must be preserved to prevent our total extinction.<br/><br/>The Terminator series deals a lot with the growing human desire to create machines to replace ourselves, taking this to the extreme of machines becoming so widespread that they attempt to destroy the human race and take over. I love the way it all comes about, which we don't really learn for sure until Terminator 3, since that's the only one of them (so far) that has been released after computers really exploded and became almost required in modern life.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about the Terminator series as a whole is that it gets better and better with every movie, taking into account new inventions and changes in modern life as it goes along and still managing to make the story work. With The Terminator, James Cameron has written and directed one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, despite the fact that many of the special effects are pretty badly dated (also look for Bill Paxton in his best role until Weird Science!). You walk away from a movie like this looking up at the sky and wondering. That's unheard of.<br/><br/>
Science Fiction doesn't get much better than this."

","I saw the Terminator at my old neighborhood theater, the Alpine. It was the kind of theater where the occasional stray cat would run across the bottom of the screen on a Saturday night followed by one or two of his pals. It was the kind of theater where your shoe might stick to the carpet from all the spilled soda. It was the kind of theater where the occasional shootout had been known to happen, thankfully never while I visited. It was the last movie I got to see there because after it's run, they replaced it with ""Cooley High"" and ""Them"", the last two movies that would ever be shown there. The theater was torn down to make way for a McDonalds, which is still there to this day. I guess the reason I'm telling you, dear IMDB user, about the theater is because it was a symbol of ""the old days"" for me. I was ten years old when I saw the Terminator, nineteen years ago. Thinking about that fact while watching T3 two days ago made me feel a little sad, especially when it dawned on me that I had watched that movie and it's two sequels with one my oldest and closest friends. Sad to say, I think the state of movies these days has dwindled. I remember going to the movies in those years not only to see great special effects and unflinching violence (cut me some slack, I was a kid then; what kid didn't love movie violence?) but with the sincere hopes that I would be hypnotized by a great story. These days, it's rare that you actually get that. You might get some astounding special effects wrapped around a thin shell of a ""story"" and that's if you're lucky. The Terminator was one of those movies that blew me away when I first saw it and it did so with an intensity that still rivals most action movies I have seen ever since.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into plot details because honestly, if you're reading this, I think you know what to expect already. For those out of the loop, just know that this is the movie that made Schwarzenegger and that's no exaggeration. The definition of ruthless in the dictionary should have a picture of him from the movie right next to it. I remember watching this movie and the feeling I got, when he went into the police station and mowed down everyone and their mothers who even dared to stand up and get in his way is still a feeling I get when I watch that scene, almost twenty years later. Not that I enjoy seeing the cops bite it in fantasy or reality but the thrill of watching an unstoppable killing machine destroy everything in it's path with such frightening single-mindedness in achieving it's goals.... it's really something else. This is one of those movies that I have never gotten tired of. It's a B-movie but a B-movie with heart. There's a reason that it was voted one of the ten best movies of the '80s and it's because it's infinitely rewatchable. All of the characters are memorable in this. The only gripe that I have with the flick is that the special effects haven't held up all that well and to be truthful, they were never really that good to begin with, even back in '84. It doesn't detract much though because this movie grabs you from it's opening shot and never lets you go. This movie isn't about how cool the effects are or how much action it has. It's a movie with a great story that doesn't get overwhelmed by anything else. I love this movie and I can't recommend it enough. If you haven't seen this movie, stop reading this and go get the damn DVD. If you think the movie sucks I will gladly refund the $15 or so dollars. Just be prepared to give me a convincing explanation as to why you hated it.<br/><br/>I hope that people reading this understand the sentimentality behind my review. There was a time when I used to enjoy looking forward to seeing movies on the big screen. I still enjoy the occasional movie in the theaters these days and it's funny how the really good ones are made on a smaller scale. I just feel like these days, it's all about how much of a budget gets approved and how much of it goes towards the film's big action set piece. That's fine and all but how about giving me a good story to go with it? Maybe one day, the flicks will recapture the imagination they once had without resorting to the ageing tactics employed today. Long live the Terminator, in all his stop-motion glory.<br/><br/>RATING: ***** out of *****."
"Lt_Coffey_182","10","2","3","22 June 2003"," Pure, dark brilliance
","I have always loved this film, for well over half my life. I was about 6 when I first saw it, 12 years ago. T2 had always been my favourite film but recently, The Terminator has eclipsed T2 to become my favourite movie of all time. There is so much more to this film than its sequel. T2 is simple action whereas this film is an action, romance, horror and suspense thriller all rolled in to one.<br/><br/>The Terminator's story is very strong and eclipses every Sci-Fi film there is. The idea of time travel has always fascinated me and, whilst this film does not explore as much as Back to the Future does, the intricate description of Reese going back through time and the bleak setting of the future world is highly imaginative. Cameron does really well at capturing the audience's attention and imagination and shows how talented a director and writer he is. The love story between Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is beautiful. The idea of a man travelling back in time to protect the woman he loves is so wonderful and sentimental. As well as having a good story, this film is highly entertaining. The TechNoir bar scene, the car chase and the police station scene are especially good and are absolutely stunning to watch.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is brilliant. Arnie was not at all developed when it came to acting which made him much less human which is very effective when playing a cyborg. Schwarzenegger is not in this film to deliver lines with any power, but is in more as a physical force and someone who appears unstoppable. Kyle Reese is, for me, the best hero ever and he is played by my favourite actor. His intense vulnerability makes him very interesting and the way he is so prepared to sacrifice himself for the mission objective, the love of his life. Biehn is so good in this role as he plays protector very well but does perfectly at playing someone 'lost in time'. Biehn's performance in this film is sadly underrated but for me, it is completely unforgettable. Linda Hamilton is brilliant in this film and her character's gradual transformation, which is completed in Terminator 2, is very convincing. Her ability at appearing terrified is equally convincing. There is also good support from Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield as the policemen investigating the case. They do well to give the film a touch of humour and their contrasting personalities makes an effective pairing.<br/><br/>The fact that this film was made on a small budget also impresses me, especially as the special effects don't work out too badly, except for the stop motion scene where the endoskeleton is chasing Kyle and Sarah. Stan Winston is a special effects genius and it is incredible to look at all the films he has worked on. His wizardry at transforming James Cameron's artwork to solid matter is very impressive to say the least.<br/><br/>Also good is Brad Fiedel's score. Whilst it is simplistic and completely on a synthesizer, it matches the mood of the film perfectly, and is very effective at getting an adrenaline rush. Also, the Terminator theme is a classic tune that will live on in eternity just like the Jaws theme. Tahnee Cain and the Tryanglz make up the bulk of the small amount of songs The Terminator has to offer and like the score, their songs reflect the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>An intensely stylish film that benefits very well from being shot mainly at night to give a real dark atmosphere, Terminator rose above a moderate budget to become an all time classic. The Terminator did a fantastic job at bringing credibility back to the Sci-Fi genre and simultaneously show the importance of a human theme. Almost everyone has seen this film, if you haven't, you really must! James Cameron at his very best."

","Don't get me wrong, I like T2, but it concentrates on more violence than the actually reason Terminator resurrected in the first place.

","Like other great action films, this is a very fast paced and thrilling ride that barely let's you catch your breath; but unlike most other great action films, the acting is very good, and the writing is phenomenal, giving us incredible dialogue, among other things. T2 is very good, but when I watch The Terminator, and I find myself wanting to memorize five or six lines or even write a book about humanoid machines or time travel, I realize that this one is much more exciting and impressive. Besides, that kid in T2 really annoys me.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger do a good job, but Michael Biehn is the one who does not get enough credit for this movie. However, he was lucky enough to get the best lines by far. ""That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear; and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!"" That line would be good if only said well, but when Biehn says it, it might be my favorite line of all time; and there are several other great lines in The Terminator.<br/><br/>I can't think of one general thing that is bad about this movie. Aside from the afore mentioned dialogue, action, and acting(which includes the actors with smaller parts like Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Earl Boen and Bill Paxton), the plot is brilliant, the music is great, and even the performance and handling of the dogs was impressive!<br/><br/>I used to think that Empire Strikes Back was my favorite movie, but since recently watching The Terminator, after not having seen it in years, I'm pretty sure this is my favorite film of all time.<br/><br/>Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub"

","This action film contains few dialogues and most scenes are about TerminatorÂ´s woman hunt.

This gives us the origins of Sarah Connor and her struggle against the machines. This has to be one of my favorite Arnie films; this and T2. It's also one of my favorite James Cameron sci-fi films, along with Aliens and Avatar. Though Arnie is portrayed as a villain in this one, he literally steals the show.

It let Schwarzenegger slip the bounds of his very limited niche as a bodybuilder and made him an action star. Cameron didn't seem to see it as a science fiction film, but it is now a classic in that genre. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were fantastic as well. There are a lot of comments about plot holes, but there are always going to be possible paradoxes when it comes to time travel movies/books. The effects were pretty awesome for 1984. The terminator itself, with its relentless focus on its mission, has also become an iconic character/idea. You really have to give Cameron his props for imagination. Note to Cameron: There is probably an entire movie waiting to be made in the 2029 world of John Conner/humans vs. Skynet/HK's/terminators."
"oskar-nyman","9","1","1","13 July 2017"," Tension build up on a higher level.
","The Terminator is a great movie according to me. The tension build up for the scenes are executed extremely well. The movie hints with similar but subtle choices of scene blocking, and soundtrack at different parts of the movie to create a form of dramatic tension.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and the symbolism that lies under it. The symbolism can be found both in visual gags and in the story concept. Example: Bill Paxton's character has a tire track mark as a tattoo on his face. This mirrors the scene from the future war were a Machine Tank drives over a stack of human skulls. And what happens? Bill's character gets figuratively driven over by the machines. (He gets killed by The Terminator).<br/><br/>The visual effects works for all but maybe one scene. The close up of The Terminator's face just before he puts on his famous sunglasses (to hide his now visible robot eye), looks kind of too dummy looking. The rest of the effects works great. The context helps some of the effects. Like that the Terminator skeleton's walking style is a bit weird. They added a concept of which that the Terminator was damaged in the foot. Which in universe makes the weird walking style more appealing. <br/><br/>The movie follows the Chekhov's gun principle in many ways. There is nothing wrong with filler details though. This movie is good at planting such Chekhov objects. Some require multiple viewings to notice.<br/><br/>Things the movie did right: The plot, both overall and subplots. The love story. The soundtrack. The technique used for tension building. The less is more editing. Multiple minor gags that I find entertaining. Hidden symbolism.<br/><br/>Things the movie could have done better: The close up of the dummy Terminator face could have been shot differently for more belief. They should have kept the deleted scene at the end. <br/><br/>10/10"

The basic idea of the film is that in the future most of humanity has been wiped out by machines. A brave man named John leads the human resistance against the machines. Machines are nearly wiped out, when they send the Terminator, an almost unstoppable cyborg back in time with one goal:murder Sarah , the future mother of John.

"arussell23","10","1","1","2 July 2015"," 'The Terminator' has classic action thrills that will please most, if not all
","In the early 1980s, James Cameron came up with the idea of the film and when his agent told him it was a bad idea, Cameron fired him. Originally, the film was to include two Terminators, one of which would have been a liquid type (later used in T2). He later changed it to just one. He sold the rights to Gale Anne Hurd for $1. Literally. Anyway, in 1984, the film was released to rave reviews. By that, I mean it has an 8.1 on IMDb and a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. If that's not rave, I don't know what is. So, let's see if the critics are right or if they're just nutcases.<br/><br/>The Terminator follows unassuming Sarah Connor as her life is turned upside down by a man claiming he's from the future to protect her, and a man who is part cyborg whom is trying to kill her to prevent a future war from ever beginning.<br/><br/>To be honest, until today, I had never seen any of the Terminator films. I had heard many praise them and had heard a lot of good things about them but had never seen them. Now that I've seen one, I can definitely say that all the things people have said about the Terminator films being good are true.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty well done from everyone. Arnold Schwarzenegger has that robotic feel to him already so he obviously does a great job as The Terminator, saying some truly hilarious lines like the scene where he says ""Fuck you, asshole."" Just brilliant. Michael Biehn does a great job as a man coming from the future to protect Sarah Connor at the advice of her future son, John Connor. Don't expect me to explain that one to you, go watch the movie. Linda Hamilton does a great job as well portraying the woman trying to come to grips with what a man from the future is telling her, believe me, I know how weird this sounds, haha. Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen do good in their somewhat-limited roles as the detectives assigned to Sarah's case.<br/><br/>The music by Brad Fiedel is awesome. The music over the opening credits is really cool, and although it's expanded upon a lot more in future sequels, the original ain't bad either. The cool thing about the score is that it's not just the big action sounding score, it has some emotional music in it too. Always nice to have diversity. The visual effects are great in this film, especially for a film released in 1984. At the end of the film, the film uses stopmotion and other effects to great lengths. It all looks quite natural and works very well.<br/><br/>The cinematography from Adam Greenberg looks awesome, and makes the film look the part of a basic chase through the streets of Los Angeles. It's pretty darn cool. The script, too, is written very well, written mainly by Cameron (even though Hurd got a writing credit too), and is very tight. It manages to restrict the film to it's chases and a few different places where the characters spend anywhere from 5-10 minutes. It's very cost-effective, especially since the film was only made on a $6.4 million budget.<br/><br/>Perhaps my only problem with the film (I know, shocking, I have issues), is that the first thirty minutes or so before the club scene are a little slow-moving and it really does take a while for the film to kick into gear. It's not a big problem, really, just me nitpicking, but it did bug me a bit.<br/><br/>Overall, The Terminator is a fantastic action thriller. While the film's first act moves a bit slow, the effects are ahead of it's time, and the acting, music, cinematography and script all are just as fantastic. I'm so excited now to watch the next Terminator film, especially since I just saw a fantastic one, and people say the next one is even better. If you haven't seen The Terminator, please check it out, it will be worth it, I promise.<br/><br/>10/10. | Grade: A"
"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","23 June 2015"," James Cameron's Breakthrough Feature Is An Undeniable Classic In Every Sense Of The Word
","One of the most original, influential & greatest examples of sci-fi actioners to surface on the silver screen, The Terminator is a masterwork of quality storytelling & passionate filmmaking that brims with unique ideas, clever imagination, relentless creativity, compelling characters & state-of-the-art craftsmanship, and is also notable for launching the filmmaking career of James Cameron while solidifying the star power of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The Terminator follows its titular character; an unstoppable & indestructible cyborg assassin from the future who is sent back in time to terminate Sarah Connor; a young waitress in the present day whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines in the post- apocalyptic future. Also arriving from the same future into the present world is Kyle Reese; a soldier whose only mission is to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminator at all costs.<br/><br/>Written & directed by James Cameron, The Terminator marks a remarkable breakthrough for the then-new filmmaker into the Hollywood industry & wonderfully showcases his excellent understanding of what constitutes a great cinema. It's astonishing how amazingly well this film has aged over the years despite its low budget plus what Cameron manages to put up on the screen on that allowance only speaks volumes about his sweeping cinematic vision, creative ability & precision eye for detail.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, I've got nothing but praise for this film. The special effects team does a terrific job in bringing to life what is a frightening portrait of a post-apocalyptic future & it looks incredibly convincing on the screen. A few effects do appear slightly dated but it doesn't affect the whole experience by any means. Cinematography makes smart use of camera in sustaining the film's tense ambiance from start to finish while Editing unfolds the story at a brisk pace & is at its best during the action sequences.<br/><br/>As far as acting department is concerned, The Terminator features an interesting ensemble in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton & Michael Biehn, and all 3 of them have done an outstanding job in their given roles. Biehn balances himself well as Kyle Reese, Hamilton's character arc is most rewarding for we see her going from a vulnerable victim to accepting her fate & fighting for her survival, but the real star of the film is of course Schwarzenegger in the role of Terminator; who is now ranked amongst cinema's most iconic characters.<br/><br/>Requiring minimum amount of dialogues & a physical built that's imposing n intimidating at the same time, the role of the Terminator was tailor-made for Schwarzenegger's talents and he absolutely nailed it with his mute expressions, automated dialogue delivery & machine- like movements to give life to an antagonist that's simply invincible. Last but not the least, the background score by Brad Fiedel is an underrated gem in itself whose main theme has easily become one of the most recognizable tracks in existence today plus it compliments the whole narrative in a fascinating manner.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Terminator is one of the best films of the 1980s that has exquisitely endured the test of time, is a landmark achievement of its genre that continues to inspire & influence films even today, and is one of the proudest works in the career of both Cameron & Schwarzenegger. Unforgettable for its contribution to pop culture, immortal for its lasting influence on science-fiction & action filmmaking, and significant for enriching the film world with a master storyteller who would go on to script an unparalleled legacy of his own in his later films, The Terminator is an undeniable classic in every sense of the word."
"vishaal811","9","1","1","10 June 2015"," An influential classic!!
","The Terminator is one of the most popular and well-known science fiction movies ever made. The film is quite well-paced and provides thrills throughout its runtime. Even though the special effects might not dazzle the people who are watching in 2015, they must have been quite impressive at the time it was released. The story involves a Terminator that is a Cyborg sent back into time to terminate Sarah Connor. The titular Terminator is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger who has minimal dialogs in this movie but is able to portray the ruthless demeanor of the emotionless cyborg perfectly. The film does not dwell too deep into the technicalities of time-travel but the action scenes make up for its plot holes. The director James Cameron rose to fame following the success of this movie and that is because the movie is timeless. A must watch!!!"
"geminiredblue","10","1","1","9 June 2015"," I'll Be Back!
","Over the years, James Cameron has made quite a name for himself. Especially in terms of ""sci-fi"" and ""action/ adventure"" movies. But long before TITANIC, AVATAR, and ALIENS, he came up with this original idea. In the not-too-distant future (now anyway), a nuclear war has taken place between the world superpowers. In the wake of the fallout, homicidal machines have risen up; attempting to exterminate the human race. In a desperate effort, the machines have built a time machine and sent a nearly-indestructible cyborg assassin, The Terminator (played icily by Arnold Schwarzenegger), back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance. To protect her, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) a future soldier is sent back through time as well. Combining the best parts of horror, sci-fi, action, and crime drama, James Cameron keeps the movie going at a blistering pace without sacrificing the compelling (and necessary) human story. In many ways, this film was (and still is) a classic from the 80's. Now with TERMINATOR GENISYS due out in the theaters this summer, maybe it's time you go back in time and see how the series all began!"
"schroeder-gustavo","10","1","1","5 June 2015"," Dark, Beautiful Masterpiece
","What I think is most impressive about T1 is how much Cameron achieved with a relatively low budget of $6.4 Million. The music is awesome, the shots are beautiful and, although it doesn't hold up as well as T2, it is still a landmark of sci-fi/action cinema that any movie buff needs to see at least once. Many people may think its kind of slow and the low budget shows, but that does not take away the fact that the Terminator is an insanely well directed, masterpiece of cinema with a story so original it is hard to imagine anyone will imagine anything as breathtaking as the wasteland shown in the Terminator Series. I stand by saying T2 is the best in the series, but it is definitely a close one."
"evandewangga97","8","1","1","19 February 2015"," The Birth of Machine-Fiction
","This is the first successful debut of Cameron as director. And he did it really nice. I am personally a man of movie taste, that really likes originality as the basic aspect. In this year (2010's), however, there are so many copycats in cinema. The rebirth of idea, is so rotten, that even the visual-effects is brand-new, the story is unpleasantly same. I just can't watch movie like that. Fortunately, I've found the era of idea treasure, it was in 1980's, the new beginning of action and science fiction. ""The Terminator"", is one of the first notable movie that defines its decade. It is somehow full of explosion, but still pay attention in its screenplay. Yeah, I know that the acting is not that good, but just be honest, the robot's acting, good or bad it is always the same. Don't mind the acting from the robot character, at least for this movie. A little awkward act don't break the entire movie, but there are other reasons that make it worth eight out of ten. My general statement for this film is astonishingly creative from the screenplay until the editing, mind the acting.<br/><br/>Usually, it's hard to make something new even in the movie, and it is harder to be accepted by the general audience. But, I think it is just came at the exact time. From the time-line of cinema we know that ""Star Wars"" and ""Alien"" have started the trend of science fiction in the late 1970's. But, the firework of this genre is begin in 1980's, when there are so many ""scientific"" creature that starred the movie. From robot, UFO, alien, etc. So do the action-genre, it also began in 1980's, ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"" hit the movie-lovers with not so familiar genre. It can be concluded that ""The Terminator"" came at the right time. When the hype of all the trend is high, it released as one of the science fiction node. Just think, everyone, no matter who, must have been heard about this movie. It's just another effect of the trend. Even until now, they keep airing this movie over and over. Just for introduce the original-sequel of epic fiction.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the movie itself. Don't worry, it's still human enough. Of all, the science fiction aspect I just love the future- fairy-tale spoken by future human. And, the unaccepted story by the nowadays human, that's all I mean in that movie. The feeling of being alone in the world, trapped in another world that nobody would care of you. Yeah, that pain only available in story, or in reality if we truly experienced it. The action is so incredible, society realizes another kind of suspense, the fast scene with so many explosion. That's the modern suspense. With the climax in the end of the movie and obvious yet unbeatable enemy, just other classic aspects of ""The Terminator"". In fact, it's the Cameron style to provide such a splendid cinema experience, that I think everyone would sit and watch until the movie is ended. Brilliant directing skill in middle era of cinema.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is the birth of machine-fiction. I just admire the very idea, combined with technical aspects, this movie is nothing but pleasantly-sharp."

"darth_timon","9","1","1","18 December 2013"," A Legend is Born...
","It's fair to say The Terminator film, made on the comparative cheap, propelled both James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger to the pinnacle of stardom. Not only that, but the film would give rise to a huge franchise.<br/><br/>The Terminator is the perfect vehicle for Arnold- his physique lends itself naturally to the role of an unstoppable killing machine, and his movements in this film are robotic and cold. There is not a single sense of mercy from this machine- the Terminator is a creepy, relentless killer.<br/><br/>The Terminator is also one of Linda Hamilton's earliest roles and her character of Sarah Connor, the mother of humanity's saviour, is a role she would come to be closely identified with. Her wide-eyed, innocent character has her world shattered, and Hamilton's performance is good. She conveys this perfectly.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn plays the desperate, war-weary Kyle Reese, the man sent back in time to somehow protect Sarah from the Terminator. His aggression, his rigid military attitude, slowly gives way to pain and torment- both because of what he's been through and because he falls in love with Sarah, ultimately becoming the father of the very man who sent him back in time.<br/><br/>The special effects are great for the time and watching the film today, it still looks good, which is remarkable considering when it was made. There are several stand-out scenes (including where the Terminator rises out of the fire) and the whole film is a fast-paced, gritty, nervy tale, as you wonder how the good guys can possibly destroy the machine chasing them.<br/><br/>Things end on a poignant note- the Terminator is destroyed, but Kyle dies. Sarah then has to face the future, knowing that sooner or later, a great storm is coming."

","Today the effects used in the movie are outdated so most of the young generation will probably discard them but when released The Terminator was a masterpiece and gave plenty of material for many screenwriters to work with. It's no secret that even today many movies are inspired by The Terminator and why shouldn't they when we have 3 amazing actors (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn) who simply gave their all for this movie to be a hit? Sure the plot may seem as far too complicated at first but James Cameron wanted to get deep into the entire time paradox and he made it. Was it a success? Well i think that if it wasn't then The Terminator wouldn't be considered one of the top movies of all time. Is a time paradox like that possible? Probably not since something needs to exist now in order to exist in the future and not vice versa but in the end we are talking about a movie and it simply doesn't get any better than this."

","The Terminator launched an era of sci-fi action and endless copy cats that never lived up to the originals. The film sets a lone soldier Kyle Reese who is sent back through time to protect a woman Sarah Connor who has a important destiny in the future. His opponent is a half human half machine programmed to kill Sarah at all cost. The film is both quite violent yet blends a romantic story within it's plot that is touching and central to the story. For a film of the middle 1980's the visual effects are still good yet somewhat dated but when this film first appeared they were amazing. Stan Winston was a master of animatronics and makeup effects and his work shines here. Arnold Schwarzenegger comes off well as the emotionless machine and is well balanced by Micheal Biehn's passionate Reese. Linda Hamilton completes the trio and does solid acting as a confused and scared Sarah Connor who finds her world and reality crumbling as the film progresses toward it's conclusion. This film defined Arnold as action star and coined one of the most well known one liners in Hollywood history."

","Like the title to this review said, I have vastly enjoyed both 'Terminator' and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day'. Despite T2 being regarded Cameron's best film and the best of the series I personally enjoyed 'Terminator' a little more. I really loved the simplistic story, the acting was amazing and seeing our beloved Arnold Schwarzenneger play the bag guy, cyborg, was completely badass and awesome. Arnie was more enjoyable in the original because he seemed terrifying. The scenes where he gets shot, but just rises up were breathtaking. <br/><br/>The acting, the dialogue and story were brilliant. One issue with the film, and the only I find, is the special effects in some scenes such as the cyborg's mask. It was obviously fake but it doesn't strike me that hard. In fact, by the end of the movie I can completely forget about the bad FX in that scene. The action was brilliant, the direction and pacing were flawless and like I said before, Arnie playing a BAMF is a little cooler than him playing a protector. <br/><br/>Absolutely legendary film, and extremely underrated!"

","Lean, mean and efficient. Like its title-character, so is James Cameron's breakthrough film, ""The Terminator."" Securing its status as a sci-fi classic almost immediately upon impact, it made a star out of a certain Austrian bodybuilder, introduced Hollywood to one of the finest blockbuster directors of our time and forever changed the landscape of both the science fiction and action genres.<br/><br/>The film opens with a muscle-bound machine -- or a ""Terminator"" as they are more commonly known -- (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arriving in Los Angeles, strictly for business purposes. It seems he has been sent back in time after his creators -- the man-made machines that have taken over and enslaved civilization -- have exhausted all their resources in trying to squash a pesky pest in resistance leader John Connor. His mission: destroy Connor's mother, (Linda Hamilton) before he has even been conceptualized, thus ensuring victory for all machine kind. Soon enough the bad bot finds a thorn in his side, as the resistance has found a way to send one of their own, a solider by the name of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), back in time to preserve the future fruit of Miss Connor's loins.<br/><br/>What is often forgotten about the film amidst its cultural impact is just how tightly-paced and well oiled it really is. There truly isn't a moment of fat to be found here. Keeping things under the two hour mark, Cameron crams just as much action as he does character into the film. Sure, there are action scenes galore and you can bet it'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Crucial to the film's success though are moments where the film breathes, letting in moments of social commentary and humor like fresh air at all the right moments. To be sure, the Terminator's pursuit of Kyle and Sarah is made all the more intense because you believe in them and are placed amidst the chaos via your own investment in the characters.<br/><br/>While Schwarzenegger is absolutely unforgettable as the unstoppable killing machine, the film is certainly helped a great deal by Biehn's intensity and commitment to material that may have sounded ridiculous on paper. Hamilton plays it straight as the girl-next-door type caught in the crossfire. Shame her career never really extended beyond this film and its sequel, as she really embodies a character you want to root for. Of course, none of this would even matter if not for Cameron's knack for white-knuckled action and tension. Almost like John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" with a robot, the film is stripped down and singularly focused. As Reese states early on, The Terminator will not stop until Sarah is dead. Keeping true to such a theme, the film is intense from front to back.<br/><br/>While there are certainly things that date the film -- some rough effects by today's standards, Linda Hamilton looking a bit like Joe Dirt -- it has held up remarkably well over the years. At close to 30 years of age, there are few films that have come along in its wake that can even compare. Even if you've seen it a hundred times, it still entertains like few films of its ilk can. Truly a bonafide classic, ""The Terminator"" stands in a class by its own. Be sure to look out for the equally awesome sequel, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" but beware of the diminishing returns brought on by two later sequels and a well-meaning but utterly unnecessary TV series."
"Desertman84","10","1","1","21 October 2012"," A Major Influence In Future Sci-Fi And Action Films
","The Terminator is a science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, co-written by Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd and William Wisher Jr. and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. Schwarzenegger plays the Terminator, a cyborg assassin sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, played by Hamilton. Biehn plays Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future sent back in time to protect Sarah.Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of co-writer/director James Cameron and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Kyle Reese is a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor, the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator, a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructible cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two ""Sarah Connors"" who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article.<br/><br/>It is a blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso movie-making, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story.This is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. But don't overlook the contributions of Linda Hamilton, who more than holds her own as the Terminator's would-be victim, Sarah Connor that helps create a new generation of rugged, clear-thinking female action stars. It's surprising how well this film holds up, and how its minimalist, malevolent violence is actually way scarier than that of its far more expensive, more effects-laden sequel.Added to that,with its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why it continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks."
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","1","21 September 2012"," Marinetti's Hero
","A few way cool things to talk about: <br/><br/>Every time a machine works right down to a wheelbarrow, it changes everything. It deeply alters and affects experience, and in time the new experience dictates its own logic and vision. You simply cannot fail to appreciate, for instance, the tremendous opening up of vision enabled by the automobile invention: new borders to the world, radically new impressions of seeing (in-car), the new span for knowledge, experience and time, and how that reprograms everything, like how far you can travel to court a woman and spread your genes. We are all being rewired these days by this internet thingamajig.<br/><br/>One of these new roads paved (in part) by the automobile was an Italian movement called Futurism. Those guys took to rapturous, often combative appreciation of everything new about technology in the 1910's, fascinated by mechanics, speed, industrial noise, the precision of gears (which they hoped to express in art). Incidental to that was their fervent support of war, in their view nature's machinery for cleansing itself. Ideas from there seeped to the newly formed Soviet Union, and melded with Marxism found cinematic expression in guys like Dziga Vertov: if you don't know, he was up to some pretty radical things, looking for machine-like precision in the gears of vision.<br/><br/>Flash forward - sixty years later. Roger Corman's factory is one of few places where film is an actual assembly-line. Sets, shots, effects, they're all interchangeable parts cheaply recycled from one b-film to the next. A young James Cameron is tutoring there. His focus is strictly on making devices work, function above art. This is nothing like the computer-generated effects we have now, those days it was a job you did with your hands and KY jello. He's one of few talented guys working for Corman, a real workhorse. He's so driven, the story goes that he flew all the way to Italy to fight producers over control of the dreadful Piranha gig.<br/><br/>So here's Cameron's start in the business, the first time he was in control of both mechanical parts and the overall machinery of camera and vision. The idea reportedly came to him while in Rome, a single image: a metallic endoskeleton emerges from flames. This could be his way of denying the Harlan Ellison influence, but either way. You can imagine the incredible , primeval allure of that vision to a practical man like him; it must have been high pleasure of the scope of a naval engineer caressing with his mind the steel hull of a new submarine.<br/><br/>And this is what the film is about, a craftsman's vision of what he does. Mechanism. <br/><br/>Oh, there is a story of nuclear wars and time travel from a bleak future. There is a love interest and actual scene of lovemaking. But, all of it is mechanical on the human end, simple cogs. It's sketched quite clearly in the film; the film flags when we stop to have story explained to us, until we return to the exciting precision of function of the Terminator plot. The function is strictly violence, Marinetti's exhilarating futuristic war meant to cleanse the world of rotten humanity, and all the other Futurist tropes, the obsession with cars and speed, with gears.<br/><br/>Central among the gear is of course a machine that is spliced into the world to bare its mechanism: rods, gears, voice emulator, repair skills, ruptured silicon skin reveals electronic -camera- eye. The accompanying Terminator-vision might as well have given video games their start in first perspective.<br/><br/>Everything else is only incidental to the machine, only skin dressing for it to be presented in the world of humans and storytelling, to cross into our world from Cameron's workshop.<br/><br/>Cameron does well, except one thing. I lament that he wasn't introduced by someone to Texas Chainsaw the way Scott was in preparation for Alien. It is not the roughly same genre of the two films. It's learning from Hooper's accomplishment of violent energy purely channeled and sustained in the fabric of the film, no stories asked.<br/><br/>And everything we learn about that future is simply nonsense - my favorite bit is that machines have marshaled men in forced labor of disposing their own!<br/><br/>Imagine the same film without a story of explanations, a bit like the first Alien. Two men have come back from god knows where, one a machine. The rest is tension, darkness, gears, heavy metal.<br/><br/>The machine is only defeated by another machine, human-operated.<br/><br/>Instead of going Vertov's way, Cameron would go on to attach despotic overambition to those clumsy storytelling skills - a mechanistic approach to narrative and 'message'. His cinematic machine worked, years of dedicated Corman practice made sure. And it changed everything, further tunneling our vision."
"the-timelord-victorious","9","1","1","26 June 2012"," A massive accomplishment!
","The Terminator is a perfect example of what James Cameron can do with a limited budget, and when he's not relying on special effects. There's lovely bits of character development littered through it as well, not in your face back story, just stuff that make the characters a bit more human (well bar Arnie obviously). I think what makes it such a great film is the fact that it doesn't rely on massive special effects to make it good. They really do play a back seat role, and the fact that it's just a really simple narrative makes it work very well. It's more of a violent game of cat and mouse, with a massively overshadowing sense of no hope. The plot is well thought out, and the characters are very believable. There's no doubt in my mind that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a terrible, terrible actor, but the thing about him in the Terminator series is that you just don't care. The main reason being is that he's playing a cyborg, and isn't supposed to show any emotion. I think what this film managed to do very well, which I think lacked in all the other films, is the genuinely chilling atmosphere. I think the soundtrack plays a really big part in this, it sounds like a violent, orchestrated game boy soundtrack. There's something just so fitting about it.<br/><br/>I really love Judgement Day, and find it the best in the series, for the mere fact that it feels a lot more entertaining, and even though it's a massive blockbuster movie, Cameron (before he got bad) managed to perfectly balance action and drama. The first one however, I think is a massive accomplishment and I part of me loves just how independent it looks. It was made with a budget of 6 million, and I really do feel that more movies today would benefit from having a really stripped back budget, just so they can concentrate on character development and atmosphere rather than shooting and explosions and putting everything on the screen with SFX."
"paddymeharg","9","1","1","15 June 2012"," The unstoppable cult icon.
","Schwarzenegger; love him or hate him you have to give him credit for knowing what he is and what he isn't. He knows his acting presence is never going to be mentioned with the same breathless awe of Meryl Streep. Arnie does a great job of choosing roles that suit him perfectly. One of those roles is the near monk-like silence of the cult classic killing machine known as the Terminator. <br/><br/>We can overlook the fact that Skynet chose to send back a Terminator with a heavy Austrian accent to 1980's America because over the twenty or so times I have seen this film I really could not care less. This is probably Schwarzenegger's greatest film. The role doesn't ask too much of him and he plays it perfectly. As soon as Arnie is teleported, crouching fully naked beside a dump truck he is the Terminator. Many people would demean him, claiming it only works because he cannot act. I disagree. Acting is making the viewer believe and whilst watching this film you don't see former Mr Universe, you see an unstoppable cyborg killer would will not stop and not rest until he has completed his task. <br/><br/>What works for The Terminator is the simple premise and James Cameron's ability to put a new spin on something we've seen before. He did it with Alien and like it or not he did it with Avatar. The rules of time travel are well worked out and simply explained. Nothing dead can travel back in time (Hence why we get treated to Arnie and Michael Biehn's buttocks at the start of the film). The Terminator itself cheats this rule by being living organism over metal skeleton. <br/><br/>Perhaps most striking about this film, given that it was made in the action hero 1980s where machine gun wielding bodybuilders was the norm, is that the hero character is female. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now an icon. She's not the atypical screaming woman who's running up the stairs instead of out the door. She's a normal woman, working part time at a diner, living with a roommate and struggling to find a boyfriend that isn't more concerned about his car. When the time comes, she steps up to the demands of the film. She never thought she could be a hero or brave or fight a cyborg from the future but she does all of these things and the film is really about her and her journey. <br/><br/>Much of the colour and explanation comes from the haunted but utterly devoted Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who successfully balances the forlornness of the future with his love for Sarah and determined resolve to protect her. He is the underdog in this fight and it's hard not to root for someone so passionate. <br/><br/>A supporting cast of Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen and Earl Boen as the psychiatrist add a light-heartiness to a very bleak and depressing environment. It works. Cameron's direction and pacing transition well between visions of a possible future and the unravelling present. <br/><br/>There is a reason this film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry a requisite being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant'. The Terminator is all these things. It is a film that has referenced and inspired so many others and if it's not on your list of films to watch before you die, then you are a fool."

","It's not easy to write a review about a movie I have seen 27 years ago. This movie is quarter-century old. It's a great combination of action, science-fiction, mystery and romance. Fundementally, it is based upon a futuristic science fiction idea.<br/><br/>The present time story begins with two guys appearing out of of thin air, searching for Sarah O'Connor. One of them is a tough guy, full of muscles, who seems to kill anybody on his way without any hesitation or remorse. The other is a mild character with somewhat more delicate features.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, you realize each character has his own agenda about Sarah O'Connor. One of them is protective of Sarah while the other is trying to terminate her - hence The Terminator.<br/><br/>Why The Terminator is trying to kill Sarah is the mystery of the movie. It ties to the introduction in the beginning of the movie when we are given a glimpse of the future when mankind are battling with the machines for their survival.<br/><br/>Overall, Terminator is a great motion picture, a combination of familiar sci-fi elements put together in an original script packed with entertaining action sequences. Arnold is perfect for this role. Its almost as if the role has been written for him.

"kingtanichi","10","1","1","11 February 2004"," The birth of a legend
","I have never seen Piranha II: The Spawning, and to be honest it's not high on my priority list. So to my way of thinking, this is James Cameron's real directoral debut. And what an opening it is.<br/><br/>To be just, it really shows its obvious budget limitations at times. The calibre of the action is occasionally lethargic and under-edited, which I'd bet meant there wasn't time or money to shoot and edit more aggressively. For most films, that would be it. But The Terminator has enough brains in its scripting and execution that the film as a whole remains a choice offering. The dystopian theme of the merciless future coming back to haunt the unsuspecting past makes this a deserved classic, and Cameron shows are rare budgeting genius as to what he can and cannot show to keep his audience impressed and off-balance (he knows we'll accept the time travel and the future with minimal evidence, but we'll never forgive him if we don't see the robot under there, so that's where he put all the money).<br/><br/>What's more, the actors give it a sense of just plain fun. Linda Hamilton may embody the 80s blond toy look at first, but soon shows herself to made of much firmer stuff. Michael Biehn has never received the attention he deserved after this film. He creates a completely different kind of soldier-hero, sensitive and vulnerable, deadly with the agility of a cat rather than channeling John Wayne. In fact, in the greatest of this movie's tricks on its audience, all the traditional macho hero requirements are fulfilled admirably by Arnold Schwarzenegger the killing machine. It makes one wonder about the spirit in which Cameron contributed to that Rambo screenplay.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, The Terminator is not to be missed by anyone who presumes to say they enjoy movies. It's a good one."

","I just watched the second half of this movie on my cable channel - and although I had seen it before years ago, watching it again, in light of Terminator 2 and 3 having now been released, you realize that a) although it didn't have the budget or the special effects of the two sequels, it is still an extremely tense and watchable chase movie and b) the 3 films put together compliment each other and the whole Terminator story snaps nicely into place.<br/><br/>T2 was a great movie, and I've seen that many more times than T1 - probably just because of the fact that it's shown on TV more often. It's interesting now to be able to comment in retrospect on the movie that led to the making of one of my favorite action films.<br/><br/>The most noticeable thing about this movie, I thought, was how different Linda Hamilton's Sarah Conner was compared to the battle-hardened road warrior she was in T2. It's really weird to see her all frail, distraught, and FEMININE even, in this movie. 'Are you sure you got the right person?' she asks Kyle Reese, at one point in the movie - 'I can't even balance my cheque book!'. But of course, it is this first Arnold Schwarzenegger and this first Terminator that eventually turns her into the warrior she will be. This movie, because of its lower budget, is less glossy and less polished than its sequel. However, there is more 'grit' in the original as a result, and the effect is a darker, more atmospheric movie. Whereas T2 is an action-thriller, you could probably say that T1 is more of a horror movie - the make up they used on Arnie in the movie certainly wouldn't put him out of place in a Hellraiser, or Nightmare on Elm Street movie!<br/><br/>As for Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, I think these two were truly excellent - the acting is top notch - much, much better than in either Judgment Day or Rise of the Machines. The Terminator movies are, of course, mainly about a Robot/machines, but human characters never play second fiddle in the story line - indeed, I think it is the personal relationships formed by the humans which make the movies so good - in T1, it's the passion between Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner. When they fight for each other and desperately shout encouragement at each other, it propels the move forward and gives it a certain intensity. You find yourself rooting for Kyle and Sarah, you want them to survive, and god damn it - you want Kyle to break off the Terminator's metal skull with that iron rod in the final scene! In T2, the human aspect is John Conner teaching Arnie how to 'be' more human. The moral of T2 is that if a machine which is designed with the sole purpose of killing, can be taught the value of human life ('you can't just go around killing people!') - then why can't us humans also learn this? The relationship formed between John and the Terminator is what grounds this movie, and gives it the weight needed to elevate the quality of this sequel above that of the usual hum-drum, mass-produced by the movie studios on an almost weekly basis. In T3 - well, actually, I think the 'human aspect' in the film was actually missed, and it paid the price - it's definitely the weakest in the Trilogy by a long way. While watching T3, I didn't really care what happened to the characters, and it all felt quite lightweight and superficial compared to the first two movies.<br/><br/>Well, I guess this 'comment' has really turned into a spiel on the Terminator movies as a whole - but nevertheless, the original is arguably the best movie of the three - it's got the right atmosphere, the better characters, the Terminator theme played on a keyboard (as opposed to a synthesiser), 'I'll be back' said without a knowing verbal wink at the audience, and of course, if it wasn't for this movie, Governor Schwarenegger wouldn't be where he is today, signing graduation diplomas for the students of California."

","Released in 1984, ""The Terminator"" featured a then-unknown Arnold Schwarzenegger in the principal of an emotionless, seemingly invincible killer cyborg.  The film is viewed today as cult classic, and watching the film makes it very easy to see why.<br/><br/>In 2029, mankind has become overrun by cyborgs, who rampage throughout Earth, killing humans wherever they find them.  Two warriors are sent back through time to 1984 with the aim of finding Sarah Connor, whose as yet unborn son will be mankind's saviour in this apocalyptic future.  The first warrior is the Terminator (Schwarzenegger), sent back by the machines to kill Sarah Connor before her son can be born.  To protect her, the human resistance sends back a lone warrior, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who has a bigger role to play in humanity's future than he first believes....<br/><br/>As the film is set in the Eighties, alot of the hairstyles and fashions give it a very retro look when looked at now.  This is never more apparent when the Terminator stalks Connor at a nightclub, where teens and twenty-somethings bop away under the tacky neon disco lights.<br/><br/>The story and script are very inventive, relying very heavily on building suspense rather (as the sequel did) on slightly overblown, big-budgeted action sequences.  The main core of the story is the relationship between Connor and Reese.  Whilst romantic liasons come as part of the package in films like this, the time-travel side to the storyline gives their relationship a clever and unusual twist.<br/><br/>This is helped by the central performances of both Biehn and Hamilton, who give their characters development and depth.  Biehn is initially scarred but resourceful, before we see his more vulnerable, emotional side.  By comparison, Hamilton begins the film as a scatty, bumbling waitress and ends it a very tough and embattled woman who is forced to stand alone.<br/><br/>Completing the trio of principal parts is Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.  Largely walking through the part with a cold menacing stare, and uttering sparse (but highly quotable) dialogue, he is a unique and memorable presence in the part.<br/><br/>Special effects, particularly the model effects, seem a little dated and unconvincing now, but these are used very sparingly as Cameron directs the action scenes (the aforementioned disco scene and the final chase sequence in a hydraulics factory) with his trademark precision and flair.<br/><br/>Along with its 1991 sequel, ""The Terminator"" is still a fine example of how the traditional action movie elements of sex and violence can still be great entertainment when fused with a superb story.<br/><br/>A classic."

","The perfect role for Arnold - an emotionless, musclebound robot who talks monotonously in a series of mono-syllables. Pity he thought that he could act after this, but on balance, I forgive him as this is one of the best sci-fi thrillers ever. Better than the sequel? In that respect it is similar to Alien/Aliens - the shift in emphasis makes comparison very difficult. Personally, I prefer to look at all four movies as classics in their own right.<br/><br/>But give Cameron his due, rather than retreading old ground with his main characters, Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley are fully rounded and deeply affected by their experiences. No Jamie Lee scream queens here. Compare the burger-flipping waitress in Terminator with the gun-toting borderline psycho in T2. It's almost as though she's turned into an emotionless, musclebound robot..."

","We all know the story, so i wont bore you on that. What i want to say is this, the Terminator is a timeless classic that is often overlooked due to its far poorer and yet far well known sequel that, from my point of view, should never have been created, if it were to be so infinitely inferior compared to The Terminator. The Terminator could well have just turned into a B-movie, but didnt. The great thing about it is how right from the start to the very end of the music (another brilliant thing about it), it has you at the edge of your seat, your attention never waivers, and no matter how many times you watch it, it just gets better and better. The music is, to put it bluntly, almost the best. The only music in a film that is better is that of The Last of the Mohicans. From my point of view, the music of a film is more important than the dialogue and visuals of a film, and after the first time i watched The Terminator, that music has stuck in my mind ever since (and im glad for it !). The other reasons that The Terminator is so good is its characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his very best in this film, and i still think he has never managed to top this performace. Granted, he said less than 100 words or something, but that doesnt matter. The music and his actions when he was on screen defied any dialogue, and the less he talked, the better he was. The scene in the technoir club and the Police Station ""incident"" are two of the greatest scenes ever. Linda Hamilton was brilliant as the innocent waitress who's boring every day life, being continuously stood-up, suddenly turns into the most important living being on earth. Finally, there is Michael Biehn. Now i thought that Linda should have been catapulted into super stardom, when she wasnt, but Michael Biehns' luck in Hollywood is evan worse. He pulls off a performance that i dont think any other actor could have done. From my point of view, he was perfect. He had the greatest lines and the best character in all the film. You can really feel pity for this guy to say the least, as he seems so small compared to the massive bulk of Arnold, and yet just as Arnold keeps on getting up after being shot up, for a human, Riece does very well, showing the urgency and importance of his misson, as he must succeed. Michael Biehn gets no where near enough credit for this film, and instead of being in the Hollywood A List, hes way down the line. When it came out in the Cinemas', i watched The Rock, it had Sean Connery and Michael Biehn in it, i thought that both of them would have pivotal parts, and was hugely disappointed too see him die almost immediately after less time on screen than Ray Parkes in TPM. This guy really has been literally dumped on. Finally, James Cameron, for a guy who made the most expensive film ever, i have one piece of advice, get back to low budgets, cause this is the best film you've ever made and are ever likely to make. So, in conclusion, if anybody out there hasnt watched this film, watch it, its one of the best."

","First of all I'll say that this is my favourite movie.  Granted there are better dramas, films with superior acting and deeper stories, but The Terminator, for me, is the complete movie.<br/><br/>You have a clever Sci-fi story, time travel, one of the best villains in movie history, a love story and relentless action.<br/><br/>The reason this film really hit the mark for me was when I first saw it.  I was about 15 and saw it on video knowing nothing about it and I was blown away.  For the first time the 'bad guy' didn't tie people up, drag out a death scene only to be thwarted at the minute.  No this finally showed what a true killing machine would do.  There's two great remarks in the film that I only picked up on repeated viewings: ""Stay in a public place and you'll be safe"" and ""There's over 30 cops in this building, what could happen to you"" (sorry not a direct quote words to that affect).  These statements are then blown away as The Terminator just destroys everything that gets in his way.<br/><br/>On top of this refreshing callous violence is the wonderfully developed love story between Reece and Connor.  It's so well done that the character interplay takes place at the same time as the main action.<br/><br/>I could go on and on as to why I love this film, but I'll leave it there.<br/><br/>By the way T2 was such a disappointment when compared to  this. >10/10"

","Those of you who have not seen the movie, stop reading here and go rent or buy the video, since I allude to the ending.  The Terminator succeeds on many levels, many of which have been commented on by other viewers.  In general, I think this movie is distinguished by one of the most original and compelling story lines to ever come out of Hollywood.  An aspect of the Terminator that has always fascinated me is how it presents the idea of machine against human and machine against machine, and on a deeper level, how humans can both benefit and suffer from the machines they create.  The most compelling aspect of the film for me is how the Terminator is presented: a machine with only one main function, that of killing Sarah Conner.  Even though the robot needs to utilize a number of complex maneuvers in order to carry out its function, its sole purpose boils down to that one thing.  That's what Kyle Reese means when he tells Sarah that the Terminator doesn't feel remorse and absolutely will not stop, ever, until she is dead.  How fitting, then, that the only thing that Sarah is able to use to stop the Terminator is another machine that is even more remorseless than the Terminator, an industrial hydraulic press that knows only two commands, ""up"" and ""down"", and, like the Terminator, ""absolutely will not stop, ever"", until it is down.  There are many additional fascinating aspects to this exceptional movie that have been amply covered by others on this site.  I rank ""The Terminator"" among the top five science fiction movies of all time."

"pikkadude","10","1","1","12 February 2002"," Still a damn fine movie nearly twenty years later.
","Just caught yet another re-run of The Terminator on late night TV. Gotta say, this film still delivers the goods nearly twenty years after its release.<br/><br/>Okay, so the 80's hairstyles and the god-awful fashion date it a little, and the story has been mimicked, plagurised and downright ripped-off dozens of times by now, but essentially this is still as lean and mean as it ever was.<br/><br/>
In fact, when you compare both the original and the awesome sequel, T2, to the likes of The Matrix, this flick still reigns supreme as an astonishingly well-crafted (given the meagre budget) masterclass in how to marry complex exposition to unrelenting action, without resorting to flashy gimmickery or million dollar excesses.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron's ability to deliver the movie's sometimes weighty exposition without slowing the plot down is still a joy to behold, and the performances endure as knockouts all round - you really can still identify and believe in Kyle and Sarah's plight.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'll grant you that the effects work in the finale does look a little ropey, what with the advent of CGI, but even by today's standards, The Terminator is still a classic to be reckoned with, the technical effects work alone being near miraculous in their execution given the limited finances available.<br/><br/>In an era of formulaic junk cramming the multiplexes in the name of entertainment, The Terminator is still simultaneously smart, thrilling and iconic. Now - how many of our recent 'blockbusters' could truly claim the same?"
"jcf30","9","1","1","6 February 2002"," Compelling. Utterly.
","The ultimate success of Terminator is based on the casting of Schwarzenegger. Everybody knows that; and just a quick glance through the comments of IMDB users is enough to convince anyone that that is the majority view. But why? Surely any hulking brute could have filled the role just as amply? Answer - no. Arnie wasn't just born to play a cyborg because he had a pneumatic physique. On the contrary, it's his robotic austrian grasp of English, his total physical stiffness, and his face redolent of a Barbie Doll ""Ken"" on anabolic steroids that do it. In 1986, the real Arnie was little more than an android himself - so unwieldy that he'd had to tone down his workout for 'Conan' simply so as to be able to swing a sword comfortably. It's one reason why the play's most grating 'special effect' (the moquette head used to conduct the eye operation) paradoxically doesn't grate that much: it may look like bad Harryhausen; but then again so does Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The film's other major selling-point is its gritty reality. Terminator had low production values; and the result is a city and characters that don't look like they've been made up to look normal, but just convince naturally. Lance Henirksen, Paul Winfield and Earl Boen do a great job as fatigued, bored, caffeine/nicotine dependent middle-rankers caught up in something which they simply do not understand until it's far too late. The fact that the film only depicts the future post-apocalypse in the odd isolated scene or two (which really don't do anything for the film apart from make the limitations of its budget that bit more noticeable) keeps it firmly seated in the 80s. Someone said that the 80s are now more alien to us than a mesolithic culture. I don't agree with that in the slightest; but I vaguely see what he's getting at when I see 80s LA in Terminator; though familiar, it's cold, unfriendly, and deeply threatening. The 'First Encounter' sequence in the night-club builds up an almost unbearable sense of tension with its muffled background acoustic rock, the blood-red disco lighting, and the slow-motion photography, which suddenly explodes into full-speed, frenetic action, and the audience's terror, pent up for a good twenty minutes or more, gets a chance to release itself as Michael Biehn blasts Arnie out through the window with his shotgun, each volley almost prompting a relieved scream of encouragement mixed with fear from the viewer.<br/><br/>
Everything else slots into place very nicely: the music is brooding and, as someone else rightly puts it lower down, primitive in a mechanical way; reflecting the Terminator's quasi-primal relentlessness. Unlike T2, none of the action sequences look contrived; the sequel has a tendency to lose itself up its own sphincter with John-Woo style shots; cf Arnie's boot trampling the rose bouquet in slo-mo in the shopping mall. T1 has none of this. It is exciting, yet somehow faintly believable. There is no attempt to make the camera-work 'speak' in any way: the director is simply content to let the camera rest on the Terminator, who speaks well enough for himself. Add in the odd bit of black humour (""you're dead, honey"", quips Sarah's work chum as they view the news of the Terminator's first strike on TV) and you have an extremely compelling film. I defy anyone to watch the first ten minutes and not sit through the rest. The whole premise of the Terminator's invincibility leaves us on tenterhooks throughout, wondering how the hell he CAN be stopped. The sense of relief when it eventually succumbs is overwhelming, and postively catharthic."
"discsint","10","1","1","30 December 2001"," Insights into The Terminator *** SPOILERS ABUNDANT ***
","WARNING: I will be going into the plot in great detail, so if you haven't seen the film, please do not read this, it will spoil your first experience.<br/><br/>Having said that, I regret not being able to see this movie for the first time again. Seeing how you're still reading this, I'm assuming you've seen the film. So I won't have to tell you that it's a gritty horror film rather than the action movie which is the second installment, or that it's far superior in plot.<br/><br/>Personally I regret the fact that the film opens with a brief plot outline. I would have preferred it if the film would have just explained this along the way, but that's my only gripe.<br/><br/>This has to be one of the best science fiction/horror movies of all time. A real classic. Though the aforementioned outline tells us there is a terminator and a protector, you don't know which is which (even though it's pretty easy to guess). Furthermore, it's never mentioned that the Terminator is a machine. If you would look at this film with a sceptical, yet open, mind, you'll get one of the best first film-experiences ever. Assuming that you don't know what the Terminator is, you'll see it do things that are just not logical. This guy is being gunned down in a bar, but manages to stand up again. What is going on here. It's not until after this scene, that you'll get a Terminator Point of View (POV) which explains we're not dealing with a man, but with a machine. Later in the movie, after Kyle Reese has explained that the Terminator doesn't feel pain, you'll see it limping after being run down by a truck. If the Terminator doesn't feel pain, then why is it limping. Again this is explained later, when the flesh is burnt off, and you see it sustained damage to the foot mechanics. It's stuff like this that I live for.<br/><br/>Next, and I think this is the most important part, is the magnificent elliptic storytelling. This is easiest explained if we start in 2029. SkyNet is on the verge of losing the war, and sends back a Terminator to kill the mother of the leader of the resistance, John Connor, before he is born. In order to protect her, a protector is sent after the Terminator: Sergeant Kyle Reese. Ultimately Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fall in love, make love, and Sarah becomes pregnant of John Connor. Thinking this thing through: If SkyNet hadn't sent a Terminator back through time, Kyle Reese wouldn't have been sent, John Connor wouldn't have been born, there wouldn't have been a resistance and SkyNet would have won. Which means there basically is no beginning, unlike for instance in Back To The Future, where the past is altered which has it's effects on the present. Though the Terminator has been sent back in time to alter the course of history, all it really does is perpetuate it. (Twelve Monkeys worked according to the same principle). There is still the implication that your actions shape the future, but that changing the course of history is impossible, since changing the past will create the present that is.<br/><br/>Accuracy is also one of the strong points of the film. After Sarah has completed a plastic explosive device, Reese mentions ""Six more of those and we'll be done"". Counting the number of bombs used you will notice that only 7 bombs are being thrown. Having been in the army for 2 years with the Uzi as a personal weapon, I can tell you that there's a maximum of 30 rounds that go into the clip (actually 32, but to prevent jamming 30 is the maximum). If you would count the number of rounds being fired before the Uzi must be reloaded, you'll find that no more than 30 rounds are fired (unlike for instance Red Heat, where Schwarzenegger fires 13 rounds from a Magnum.44 which only holds 6).<br/><br/>Also the reality of the violence is magnificent. I love movies which portray violence for what it is: Horrible. Don't get me wrong, I like movies where you can cheer when a bad guy is shot, but I believe realistic movies to be superior (if you agree, you should check out Platoon and Schindler's List).<br/><br/>Lastly, though there is a significant amount of terror, there's also some wonderful comic relief. The two police officers: ""That coffee is two hours cold."" ""Uhuh"" (takes a sip). ""I put a cigaret out in it."" Or the answering options the Terminator has when he's asked: ""Hey buddy, you got a dead cat in there."" which include ""Yes"", ""No"", ""Go away"", and ""Please come back later"" until he finally selects ""F*** you, a**hole.""<br/><br/>All in all a true classic in every sense. An absolute must see.<br/><br/>Rating 10 out of 10"

"jayman_30339","10","1","1","5 December 2001"," The holy grail of Sci-fi horror.
","IMHO, you can't do much better than the Terminator.  It is sci-fi horror at its finest.  This movie introduces us to one of the best villains ever seen next to Darth Vader himself.  Anyone who prefers the kinder, gentler Terminator over the monster that Arnold portrays here is a person with quite different tastes than mine.  Watching that cyborg calmly slicing his damaged eye out and impersonating Sara's Mom are chilling sights that you won't soon forget!  Arnold absolutely makes this movie what it is, it's true that he was born to play this role, although all others involved are excellent. <br/><br/>Most people of course think of the ""I'll be back"" line, which has become Arnold's catch phrase, and has become rather tired.  Not here.  The things that the Terminator says ARE often funny, but not in a yuck-yuck one liner type of way.  The key is that the Terminator is not trying to be funny at all!  He SEEMS funny because he simply makes demands or states facts, which is not the way real humans interact.  So we laugh when the Terminator says, ""I'll be back"", not in a ""Arnolds bein' funny"" way, but in a nervous, ""what's the heck is he talking about?"" way.  He truly appears to have no soul at all, and gives the performance of a lifetime. So for those who like Arnold's newer, funnier movies, be warned- don't expect anything pleasant here. There is no kid, no happy ending, no ""everything will be all right"" message. The Terminator is very bleak, very scary, very dark, and not for everyone by any means.  But if you like sci-fi horror movies this is the holy grail and may never be topped.<br/><br/>P.S. -I don't know much about guns, but listen carefully to what the Terminator tries to order in the gun shop early in the film.  Also notice that he stares downward while talking in this scene because he's reading the list off his eyeballs.  Great attention to detail, great stuff!!"
"pamp061","Null","1","1","18 October 2001"," My stab at a review
","As there are over 140 posts here, I doubt that this will be read by many people, however, I'll get my thoughts off my chest anyhow.<br/><br/>I liked the Terminator, being a big fan of AI stories (especially Isaac Asimov, the famous SF writer). As with many movies, especially low budget cult movies, there is always room for improvement. As the saying goes, however, hindsight is always 20/20. The film was dark and contained a brooding (though primitive) soundtrack based on repeditive percussive beats, matching the systematic mechanical nature of the machines which were the 'enemy' of the film.<br/><br/>Many SF readers may be familiar with Asimovs three laws of robotics:- 1. A robot must not harm or by inaction allow harm to come to a human. 2. A robot must obey all orders given by humans, unless these contradict the first law. 3. A robot must protect itself from harm unless this contradicts the second and first laws, in order of priority.<br/><br/>Many of Asimovs stories were based around both the single mindedness of the robots, and their potential danger when these laws were not installed within them. The Terminator allows the viewer to experience a robot governed by totally different laws, of which, protecting and serving humans is DEFINANTLY NOT one of them. It opened the prospect of artificial intelligence emerging on an unprepared and undereducated world, and developing its own motives and desires, and deciding that human beings are an impedement to these desires (See Terminator 2 for an explanation of these desires - when you hear it, you almost feel sorry for SkyNet, the supercomputer which creates the terminator).<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger has become much more accomplised as an actor over the years, and is quite reasonable now (see the Sixth Day). However, back then, he was quite stiff. This fit the role of an awkward, aggressive robot extremely well, especially with that intimidating scowl permanently fixed upon his face. His then strong Austrian accent, does not impede his performance, but actually seems to enhance it in some sort of subliminal way. Perhaps watching all the old war movies where the Germans were the baddies (the Nazi elite etc...), has something to do with this.<br/><br/>The prospects of a Terminator 3 bring me a lot of hope, however I expect a lot of disappointment after discovering who the scriptwriters were. Any computer user will puke when they've seen 'The Net' - one of their 'acclaimed' works. Perhaps a wait of five years and a REMAKE of the first would be more appropriate. It might open the avenue to another tough guy actor playing the Terminator. Let's face it - Arnolds not getting any younger especially with the heart troubles and there's nothing sadder than an aging muscleman.<br/><br/>The film, at first, appears to be a tough guy film, especially with the overbuild '4 wheel drive' physique of the younger Arnold Schwarzenegger appearing at the start of the film. Whether it was intentional or not, James Cameron did the film credit by slowly revealing the nature of the Terminator (Arnolds role) as not a tough guy villain, but a very dangerous mechanical device with a totally narrow minded intent to kill the heroine of the movie, Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton). This leads to the end where, the terminator, stripped of its outer covering of cloned flesh, is revealed to be the warmachine it is. The metal skeleton covered with hydraulic muscles is an artistic masterpiece. The scene in the factory, although done with basic stop frame animation, was the one which most impressed me. This would look fantastic if done by computer animation, and lets hope a remake will be made.<br/><br/>The second movie, although very imaginative in parts, was disappointing in terms of script (though not in action and visual effects). There were many recycled themes from the first, such as the tanker chase, the mimicking to Sarahs mother/John Connors Foster mother. There are many more similarities which I'm sure you'll find. James Cameron is an imaginative director, and I think he could have done much better. Why couldn't the T-1000 have a more complex role? For example, instead of going gung-ho for little John Connor, it could in secret, construct terminators in the present time and send them after the Connors one by one.<br/><br/>The character change of Sarah Connor from the first movie to the second was a little unsettling, although novel at the first appearance. I didn't find the fact that she had turned into a hardlined semi-sane dragon woman very believable, after the performance of the vulnerable young woman she gave in the first.<br/><br/>Like I say, I don't expect much from T3, although, with some better scriptwriters, or some advice from some accomplished science fiction writers (say, Steven Baxter, Arthur C. Clarke, Poul Anderson), a very clever plot could make up for the shortcoming of making a sequel of a sequel. I hope I am pleasantly surprised. After all Aliens (by James Cameron as well) was an excellent sequel to Alien, although not quite as good. Mr Mostow, if by chance you are reading this, PLEASE CONTACT THESE SCIENCE FICTION AUTHORS, or others like them. It could give you the recognition you deserve after U-571, which I loved.<br/><br/>All the same, thanks for reading this... And I apologise for any spellung misteaks I may have made.

","Simply put, the trouble with most sci-fi flicks is that they are not very good.  This James Cameron tour de force is an exception.  The dark atmosphere, surreal tension (achieved by interspersing glimpses of a dystopic future and by proportional revelations of the characters' places in the scheme of things) and frenetic violence make for a brooding and at the same time tumultuous affair.<br/><br/>
	All of the actors from Schwarzenegger to Biehn to Hamilton shine, but the real star is the plot itself, which is clever, intricate and sinisterly plays on our dichotomous love/hate relationship with technology.  The dialogue is similarly well-crafted and of course produced one of movie histories most oft-quoted lines, `I'll be back'.<br/><br/>
	One priggish minus however: The scene where the police are staking out Sara Connor's home and leave to take another call just as the terminator arrives was unrealistic.  In such a sensationally developing case, they would have never left.  It would have been better to show the killing-machine walking up to the front door with a shot of the cops he just killed in the background."

Sarah Hamilton also gives the performance of her career and Arnold delivers an outstanding performance in the few memorable lines that he gives.

","The Terminator is a lot of things. For one thing, it's scary. Well, the movie itself isn't scary, nor was it intended to be, but the message it projects certainly is. It shows us a future full of killing, suffering, and pain. Another holocaust really. And we all brought it upon ourselves because we went too far with our technology.<br/><br/>It's exciting. The movie never gets dull. The action sequences really stand out from other films. <br/><br/>It's well acted. Arnie plays the emotionless cyborg to perfection. No one else could've played the T-800 but Arnold. Michael Biehn is probably the best actor in this film, showing many sides to his character. We really do get a sense of where he came from. Linda Hamilton was a great heroine as well and her character certainly develops well. Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield play entertaining cops. Everyone else was adequate at least. Look for Bill Paxton as one of the earlier Terminator victims.<br/><br/>It's a mix of genres. We have the T-800 knocking people off like in a horror movie. He even walks in and slaughters a couple after they've made love. The action parts of the film is obviously. It's Sci-Fi, with the whole time travel + cyborg stuff. It's also a love story.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, this movie is also emotionally touching. The sex scene between Kyle and Sarah actually enhanced the plot rather than be an excuse to see some cleavage. Not to mention, the music for that scene was just right and so were the camera angles. And when Kyle died in the end, you really felt something. Especially when Sarah pulls him over and sees that he isn't breathing. Also when she sees him being zipped up in the body bag.<br/><br/>All in all, the Terminator is a reason why I love movies so much. It's a good, exciting, and touching story that makes you think...I highly recommend this to anyone."

This man has tremendous courage. He has to go back without weapons or clothing to face a Terminator, so Sarah can live. Arnold is absolutely terrifying as the unstoppable machine. Even though people have been seeing parodies of his portrayel for nearly twenty years, his performance is still powerful. The ending is perfect.

"ikhwan_arif","6","4","9","17 December 2017"," It's Really Not That Good As People Remember It.
","Among many of Arnold Schwarzenegger's early action films, this has to be the most overrated one, and it's entirely not Arnie's fault. Ironically though, this otherwise B-grade film is responsible for propelling Arnie to A-list status. <br/><br/>Which in hindsight, is probably the only beneficial result of this otherwise mediocre film. Mediocre as in the story is weak, the dialogue is terrible, the acting is embarrassing, the production is poor, the direction is choppy, the editing is sloppy, and the special effects is cheesy and dated. <br/><br/>While the film tries poorly to make too much out of a bulimic script and story, Arnie does much by doing very little. His mere presence - such as the way he poses as he shoots down people - is a dominating display, without saying a word. That's why we love Arnold; not because of his acting (because really he can't) but because his physicality is impressive. Arnold carries this whole mess, even in scenes where they replace him with animatronics. <br/><br/>I think by now, people have finally realized how much of a hack James Cameron is. Really guys, his films aren't that great, they're good sometimes but they're not great; not Avatar, not Titanic; no. Cameron is basically, a more competent version of Michael Bay; a lot of style, not a lot of substance but I can admit that Cameron has a good grasp of what the public would want to watch in the current year. <br/><br/>The Terminator is such a film. in 1984, the show on screen that a killer robot could quite possibly travel back through time and killing humans, is a novel idea - at the time. But at this time, science and technology were not pervasive in the collective conscientiousness of the public. That is to say, you could get away with a lot of plot-holes and this film had lots of it. <br/><br/>The future resistance fighters already knew that it was near impossible to kill a cyborg one on one and yet, they just send one guy - ONE GUY - to guard Sarah Connor? Why didn't John Connor just send the entire squad present? Also, when Reese was detained in the Police Station, regardless of whether they think he is crazy, he had vital information to identify the man who is targeting Sarah Connor - what he looked liked etcetera - and yet, the police didn't question him on that. Strange no? I mean really, a police lieutenant wouldn't make such a blunder. <br/><br/>That's not all, everything about this film is off. The sound isn't quite right, the cinematography isn't quite right, some scenes were unnecessary, the action is not very good for Arnie's standard, the production set isn't quite right, the animatronics isn't quite right, everything is just off. In spite of all this, it's not a terrible film; it's just not that good. <br/><br/>Really, I think Conan the Barbarian, Commando and even Terminator 2 are better Arnie films than this."

"thewoodmeister","10","3","6","3 November 2019"," This is where it all started. The original and best.
","There's a tone to this Terminator that it's successors have never been able to really replicate. It's gritty, it's dark, it's relentless and intense. The 80's creating a perfect backdrop for the machine from the future to wreck havoc.<br/><br/>When we first meet Sarah Connor she's the naive girl next door. By the end of the film she's been transformed, and that transformation continues through T2 and now Dark Fate.<br/><br/>Arnold as the Terminator is something that we're now all too familiar with and it's hard to look back with fresh eyes, but really this performance as the cold relentless killing machine from the future hasn't been equaled. There's an edge to him that has been rounded off over the subsequent sequels so the films could appeal to a wider (and younger) audience. This Terminator had no issue taking out a police station full of cops with an unflinching menace. No wise cracks here, this T-800 is a pure thing from your nightmares.<br/><br/>Kyle Reese as the protector sent back to save Sarah Connor, is the outgunned (in this time) soldier from the future. The core of this film is actually his love for Sarah Connor, that's why he took this one way trip through time, to meet and protect the love of his life. Yes, a love story at the heart of a dark sci-fi film! The sequels have never tapped into this emotional core as well as the original.<br/><br/>No review would be complete without mentioning the effects and the score. Terminator wouldn't be Terminator without the dark industrial score that underpins all the action. The special effects even though dated by today's high cgi standards still carry weight and gravitas, and Stan Winston's skill is undeniable. You really believe that there's a machine under Arnold's muscular frame. I remember the very first time I saw the film and just when you think it's over the chrome endoskeleton emerges from the fire.... immense.<br/><br/>There'll never be a Terminator film like this one, but largely that's because it was of its time, it was original and new. However I do believe that we could learn something of its tone and grit and it's emotional core if this franchise is to move forward after Dark Fate.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film it's the original and best and stands up as one of the best sci fi films of all time."

The Terminator however is like Die Hard, a thrilling well-made film that succeeds as an action film and a film in general, and treats its audience and genre with respect. It is also one of director James Cameron's best films along with Terminator 2 and Aliens.<br/><br/>The Terminator looks great still, sure the special effects have not held up as well as the rest of the film but they are not that bad. The film is beautifully and slickly photographed and the sets and lighting are so imaginative and wonderfully nightmarish that one really does get sucked and immersed into its world., and filled with sharp details. Cameron's direction is superb, some of the best of his whole career. The music score is hauntingly eerie and its synthesised sound doesn't date the film at all, instead adding hugely to the atmosphere. The script (including the famous 'I'll be back') is snappy and smart with plenty of wittily written lines, the story is incredibly engrossing and exciting to the maximum with plenty of suspense and fun.<br/><br/>Action fans are guaranteed too to be thrilled by the action here, being both dynamic and thrilling, the climax really does jangle the nerves. Michael Biehn and especially Linda Hamilton shine in their roles, and Arnold Schwarzenegger has never been more perfectly cast as his most iconic character to date. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the greats of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Quinoa1984","10","3","6","30 April 2000"," still an action movie classic, or a 'Tech-Noir' if you will
","The Terminator - ripped from the pages of Harlan Ellison (literally ripped-off at first until a lawsuit came around for screen credit) and out of the imagination of James Cameron, it's an action movie that MOVES, fast, after a 20 minute set-up with only little bits to pause and reflect or give exposition or have a quintessential love scene. It's also the reason that Arnold Schwarzenegger got work for so many years after as a star, with a performance that oddly enough features only a handful of lines of dialog. One wonders today the T-800, Cyberdine model 101, is still (Anton Chigurh be damned) the true quiet-killer in modern cinema.<br/><br/>The set-up is simple, so simple a child or senile old person can watch and know what's going on: Kyle Reese, soldier, sent back over 40 years into the past to stop the T-800 from killing Sarah Conner, mother of the resistance-against-the-machines leader John. That's about it. There's some more, of course, including a glimpse into the future (the term ""Tecnh-Noir"" is most apt even with the rampant violence throughout), but mostly it's a chase movie, a cat-and-mouse game where the lines are drawn straight and from there on in James Cameron propells the characters and action down without a mark missed. It's the kind of movie that if you really like it the first time you'll rewatch it whenever it's on TV and love it more. It's smart, fun, ruthless contemporary film-making.<br/><br/>""Look at it this way, in 100 years, who's gonna care?"""

And it only made 40 million at the box office. Terminator became much more popular though later on by repeated tv airings and video and dvd releases.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger wasnt yet a household name back then, he was merely a B-movie actor with muscles. Everything changed for the better with this movie. Terminator launched Arnie's carreer and rightfully so, because he portrayed the ultimate killing machine in a way that is still nervewrecking and fun to watch to this very day.<br/><br/>Despite the cheap looking (sciencefiction) sets and some cheap looking special effects, there is something truly maniacal AND exciting about this action movie. A killing machine from the future (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has come to earth to kill an innocent woman. Why? And can he be stopped? This story is as ludicrous as can be, but the execution of the ACTION is fascinating nonetheless, because of the relentless killing spree, with contineous riveting action scenes upon action scenes. One big long adrenaline fueled ACTION party! The action photography is excellent!<br/><br/>Terminator 2 is considered to be better by many and it is, because this original has got some quite corny and cheap moments, which are fortunately absent in the sequel. Terminator 2 does look way much better and has got a more credible portrayal of the characters. Only the terrific action in this original Terminator made me watch it though, because besides the action, the rest of the story is rather corny, cheap looking and outdated.<br/><br/>Watch them both would be my advice, starting with the original, so things will get MUCH better when you start watching the sequel next."

Unprepared, the young woman has to fight for her life side to side with a friend of her future son to save the future of humankind.<br/><br/>The film was a bit more serious than I feared it would be, it has elements of a dystopia and some kind of theory for the background of the plot, even if that is not always brilliantly thought-through. For this reason it doesn't exclusively consist of action, which is a definite plus. The effects aged rather well and even today don't look embarassing. Unfortunately I have to say that in terms of plot and dramaturgy the film is at best mediocre. What it tells is more or less an episode, like a scene of a movie that is enlarged into a whole production. That leads to a Terminator that has so many lives that it is on the edge of being ridiculous. I would have loved to see a bit more background and future times rather than fighting sequences that don't take an end.<br/><br/>All in all this isn't just a movie of action and destruction, even though many scenes include both. Through solid acting and a somewhat consistent story it becomes an okay film that aged rather well and is widely considered a classic."

Linda Hamilton's performance, though rusty at points, is pretty good.  It's also nice to see Paul Winfield, who I think I haven't seen since ""Cliffhanger."" Lance Henriksen is always cool to watch.  The storyline is thin and easy-to-follow.  It's nice to hear the premiere of Arnie's ""I'll be back"" line.  The film didn't send me leaping from my seat, but it's worth a look.

Cameron needed to create a masterpiece to solidify his place in Hollywood and in making The Terminator he did just that.<br/><br/>Everyone puts in a stellar performance here and though the special effects leave a lot to be desired today it's safe to say that it doesn't detract from the relentless mercilessness of the killing machine that Arnie portrays. T2 came close to beating this film but for me The Terminator will always be the quintessential film in the series."

","With the passage of time James Cameron's first Terminator has emerged as one of the greatest films of all time- not just among the greatest sci-fi, but in all cinema. The pacing, the atmosphere and the vibe present in this film make The Terminator one of the most haunting films that emphasizes elements of thrillers, horrors and action films and neatly mashing them all together. The movie's strength is that, like The Matrix, it combines action with ideas. This isn't a run-of-the-mill turn-off-the-brain collection of chases and fight scenes. The plot, which involves time travel and the paradoxes inherent therein, requires viewers to pay attention or risk having no idea what's happening. The casting is so good Arnold will forever be associated with this movie and this role. The themes and ideas presented in The Terminator hold up well today, even though we have moved into the post-Cold War era and only the most nihilistic individuals could see 2029 in such bleak terms. It's a rousing science fiction story that proves an on-screen adrenaline rush need not short-circuit the brain."

"andrewnmiller","10","2","4","26 March 2018"," A movie that all modern sci-fi and horror films aspire to be like.
","Describing the 1984 classic, The Terminator is difficult for me because when I was young, I never saw it before due to being too young to watch it and so for a long time, it slipped under my viewing radar until late last year when I finally decided to give it a watch and after the end credits rolls, I was left in awe and wonderment at what I had just seen. From it's themes and dark and gritty feel to the directing and performances, The Terminator is truly a groundbreaker in terms of filmmaking.<br/><br/>The film begins in the distant future where a nuclear holocaust has wiped out much of the human race and those who have survived are engaged in a brutal war with machines known as Terminators. In order to stop the human resistance from ever winning the war, a Terminator is sent back to 1984 to kill a young woman named Sarah Conner so her son will never lead the human race to victory. Unbeknownst to them, the resistance sends a lone solider named Kyle Reese back in time to the same year to protect Sara. Upon arriving, both Reese and the Terminator obtain clothing and weapons, meanwhile The Terminator deliberately begins murdering all women named Sara Conner. After looking her up in a telephone book, both men track Sara to a nightclub and once there, the Terminator almost kills her but Reese saves her and the two make a quick getaway while the Terminator pursues them. Now, Conner and Reese must do what they can to avoid this robotic killer while trying to reset the future. <br/><br/>Upon viewing a couple movies by directors like Steven Spielberg or Stanley Kubrick, you begin to understand the way they approach certain elements of the film they're showing you, not just making the movie but also character interactions or small intricate details that help tell the story effectively. James Cameron is a fine example to use when describing this circumstance as he is a deeply talented director with a boundless disadvantage on what his filmmaking insight could be but with one high breakthrough with the Terminator and a whole other world opened for him. It's of little consequence if the director or writer doesn't makes sense of it, though some do such as Vincent Van Gogh who wrote about the creativeness he had passionately. Whichever way you choose to see it, when the movie viewing audience grasps a movie like The Terminator, the filmmaking world seems to alter as a film such as this shows both audiences and critics what can be done when a director puts his mind, heart and soul into a film and makes something truly special out of it. <br/><br/>Cameron is an absolute force when it comes to filmmaking and a infamous perfectionist when it comes to telling stories, but all that paid off handsomely as the film maintains its rewatchability without coming across as pretentious while Cameron is a master of the small details like the police officer at his disk working on his form-filling with a small pencil and stops in the middle of a sentence to look up and see a car crashing though the front doors. Since James co-wrote the script, that makes the story even more intimate rather than just a solid achievement in directing as he apparently got his idea from a dream where he was being pursued by a mechanical skeleton with a bright red eye but I wouldn't be surprised if Cameron also drew inspiration from several episodes of the Outer Limits when coming up with ideas for the movie while the entire movie seems to always have an immediate, brutal atmospheric feel and a placid sensibleness which is distinctive of a bad dream which only seems to highten the tension and dread as the Terminator hunts down Sarah and Kyle and it seems there are only a few small moments in the film that allow the viewer to catch their breath not to mention never is there a scene that just feels like it's trying to pad out the running time nor does it dumb it's subject matter down to the lowest common denominator which also makes the film more approachable for the viewer.<br/><br/>As for the filmmaking side of things, The Terminator certainly excels there too. The cinematography is to a very high standard with a dark, dirty and grungy look that makes the world Cameron has created feel much more lived in and believable while Stan Winston's stop-motion effects and Terminator endoskeleton is legendary in terms of their fluidity, movement and outright terror, but it's composer Brad Fiedel who deserves the most love: his pounding, techno-infused score is truly one of the finest film soundtracks of all time and perhaps even the best device Cameron has used in maintaining the movie's driving force. The score is astonishing, conflicting and grim all at the same time with a ceaseless bass line that keeps the movie appearing like it's not going to stop, not until the villain has be dealt with. One peculiar scene in the movie is a perfect representation of all these elements coming together under Cameron's masterful directing is the moment where both the Terminator and Kyle enter the Tech Noir club looking for Sarah. As the robot wanders though the place and advances towards the table where she is seated, the movie alternates into an unreal slow-mo as Conner drops a bottle on the floor and crouches to pick it long enough for the Terminator to forget her as he walks by. The 80s music now is faint due to the expansion of time as Brad's musical score comes into play, Sarah stands up and sees not the robot but Reese looking at her unaware that her pursuer is now circling back around and is nearly about to notice her but just when the slow-motion comes to its high point, Reese sees what Conner hasn't as the Terminator pulls a gun on her and is about to pull the trigger when Reese does the same and the viewer is suddenly thrown back into the here and now and all hell breaks loose. The amount of tension used in this one scene stays its course throughout the entirety of the movie which makes it one of cinema's most effective thrillers. Of course, the action in the Terminator shouldn't be overlooked as it's some of the finest out of any 80s action movie. The shoot out in the night club is a true masterstroke in terms of dread and tension as the Terminator and Reese duke it out and the robot takes the action up a level as he fires his gun as Kyle does the same. Once he's thrown though the glass, he gets up from the sidewalk and starts chasing Conner and Reese while the shoot-out at the police station is a perfect exercise in brutality as the robotic killing machine marches through the halls massacring everyone in sight while the scene of Sarah killing the Terminator is a benchmark of suspense and intensity. <br/><br/>As for the cast, they're all fantastic: Linda Hamilton was born to play Sarah Conner, portraying her as a more grounded, naÃ¯ve and defenseless character here rather than the battle-hardened badass we see in T2, yet it doesn't seem too mind-boggling she becomes that as the movie progresses and we see her grow as a character and begin to see the warrior side of her emerge practically at the end when she crushes the Terminator plus the chemistry between her and Biehn is prefect and any scene of them together is always a treat to watch. Michael Biehn is absolutely fantastic as Kyle Reese, portraying him as a scrawny, thin and realistic hero, so much so that the minute he's introduced, it's difficult not to see his helplessness when you see the scars across his body when he comes out of the portal and when he battles the Terminator, he is outclassed which allows the viewer to see his weaknesses as a character as does his willingness to give up his own life for his cause shows just how hopeless his situation is, something Jai Courtney failed to do in Genisys. Lance Henriksen is wonderful in his role as the police sergeant as is Earl Boen and even Bill Paxton pops up in a small role, but it's Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular villain who makes the movie so wonderful to watch. Even with his limited dialog, Arnie still is able to kick to tension up to 11 whenever he is on screen To declare that the Terminator had a foreboding presence on screen would be putting it mildly, he's absolutely terrifying as a villain due to his simple motivation of killing Sarah and nothing else which is what makes him such an effective villain and not your standard greedy bad guy with no motives we contently see now a days.<br/><br/>Honestly, is there anything else that needs to be said about the Terminator that others haven't said already? It's a must see movie even if you're not a fan of sci-fi or horror. Go watch it now."
"Mcduff3601","10","2","4","5 March 2018"," Still an awesome movie decades later
","It's not perfect don't get me wrong. Someone who watches it now who only knows the smooth (2018) CGI affects will definitely notice how dated and obvious some of the special effects are, like the bathroom scene with Arnie after a car accident (you know the scene for those who have seen it).<br/><br/>But if you don't mind (and I don't as a child of the 70's) the special effects, the clothing and the music all sastisfy my nostalgia for all things 80's. So not only do I get my nostalgia fix I also get a really great story and LOTS of action.<br/><br/>This movie will be a forever classic for me and I will rewatch it with reckless abandon!"
"Ben-Hibburd","10","2","4","19 December 2017"," The Terminator Review
","I'm going to preface this review by saying that The Terminator is one of my favourite films of all-time. And a film i consider to be a near faultless action/horror masterpiece!<br/><br/>I think by now pop culture and anyone who considers themselves a film buff knows what this story is about. So i'm not going to go into a long winded jaunt into the finer plot elements as they've been done to death already. However I wanted too highlight one area of the film that I don't think gets enough credit. And that would be the phenomenal pacing and editing. In my opinion The Terminator has the best pacing in a film that I've seen, and perhaps one of the best of all-time.<br/><br/>The film starts with a small amount of exposition which is needed. But as soon as the film shifts to the present day the film moves at a thunderous pace and never slows down. Even in the quieter character building scenes the plot is constantly being propelled towards the films endgame.<br/><br/>From the assault on the Police precinct onward the film maintains a constant fluidity of pure action intertwined with deep character motivations. There's not a single dull frame in this film, even after my thirtieth odd watch i'm constantly engaged and sucked into the film, and a-lot of this down to brilliant editing.<br/><br/>The action scenes are also expertly shot and choreographed. The transitions from one set piece to other flow smoothly, never feeling out of place. It's a truly remarkable achievement James Cameron was able to accomplish on such a small budget.<br/><br/>With exception to Mad Max: The Road Warrior I can't think of another action film that's paced to perfection. There are very few films that are able to balance action, character development and world building with as much depth as The Terminator. Editor Mark Goldblatt deserves just as much credit as Cameron got for crafting a flawless action masterpiece."
"nathanhmcdonald","10","2","4","6 October 2011"," Super Action Sci/Fy Thriller....But also the most romantic love story of the 20th century?
","I was once asked while on a date with a girl...What I thought the most romantic movie of the 20th century was. I paused, thought about it for a minute as I wanted to give a genuine answer. And ultimately I concluded that it was The Terminator, and this is why...<br/><br/>(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD) The Terminator tells a story of a man who travels across the endless wake of time on a whim to battle against an unstoppable cyborg and protect a girl whom he only knows by the old faded picture he was given of her. Ultimately the unsung hero of this movie is a man named Kyle Reese, Kyle was raised in the aftermath of a nuclear war against the most advanced computer ever created by man, all of which took place prior to his conception. He is a man who knows nothing but war as this become radially apparent throughout his character development.<br/><br/>Sara Conner is the woman he is sent to save. The reason she has been marked for death is because unbeknownst to her she is the future mother of the man who leads us to destroy the machines and win the war against them man years in the future. Kyle is tasked with traveling 45 years back in time to 1984 to save Sara Conner from an extremely hostile cyborg assassin. Ultimately this movie takes place over only a weekend, but during this weekend many things happen, from a nightclub gun battle between our hero and the cyborg to a police station massacre at the hands of The Terminator, To the ever sentimental night of lovemaking spent together by Kyle and Sara, and a final battle between Kyle and The Terminator in an Industrial Warehouse, in which our hero Kyle Reese is sadly killed by either shrapnel to the face or a broken neck either of which could have been received during a last ditch effort to kill The Terminator by use of a homemade pipe bomb.<br/><br/>Some people might laugh at the idea of The Terminator as a romance movie...But to me couldn't be more obvious. Man travels through time to save woman AND conceive the future savior of the world with. And ultimately give his life to protect the one he has fallen in love with.<br/><br/>In a delightful moment at the end of the movie...A young hispanic boy snaps a quick photograph of Sara Conner as she sitting in her Jeep at a gas station. Upon looking at the picture taken of her we see that it is the picture Kyle will ultimately end up with in the future. In an earlier reference in the movie Kyle says that he always wondered what Sara was thinking about when that picture of her was taken...Ironically she was thinking about Kyle. <br/><br/>10/10...Movie's don't get much better than this."
"brando647","7","2","4","24 December 2007"," Ah-nold kicking butt, cyborg-style!
","We really did get some of our greatest action movies out of the 1980's. In that decade, where there was action, there was Arnold. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most iconic film role, that of the unstoppable Terminator. In this science fiction/thriller milestone, the Terminator is a cyborg sent from the year 2029 to kill the mother of the man who would save mankind from the machines. Its a film nearly everyone has seen, so there isn't a whole lot to say about it. It was a great action flick that launched a successful franchise.<br/><br/>The special effects are a little dated at this point, but it isn't bad enough to pull you out of the movie. The animatronics and puppets are obvious but cool to watch. While on the topic of ""dated"", it is kind of amusing to see this movie take place surrounded by 80's style (that's some BIG hair). The film is loaded with plenty of action but it does slow down a bit after the first half when the audience is treated to the bulk of the movie's exposition. Linda Hamilton is awesome as Sarah Connor, target for termination, and has good on-screen chemistry with Michael Biehn. The only real weak spot (which isn't even really worth mentioning) in the movie was Bill Paxton in the opening as the leader of a punk gang. As minor as his role is, for some reason, he always makes me cringe. For some reason, he just aggravates me in this movie. Of course, he's only on screen for two minutes and his role means near to nothing, so ignore my rant.<br/><br/>The movie does have a couple plot holes, but only if you feel like feeding a headache with thoughts of time travel mechanics. Most people don't, so it doesn't matter. The movie is a fun popcorn flick and spawned two sequels. Don't try to make sense of things, sit back, and enjoy nearly two hours of action with 80's flair and some of Arnold's best one-liners!"

The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah, but is there any way to stop the seemingly indestructible cyborg?<br/><br/>This film is smart, maybe ingenious toward the ending, but it's no where near a great or fantastic film. Just because the ending was good doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. This film delivers the action you want, some humorous scenes, and some suspenseful scenes.<br/><br/>I liked the acting by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, while Michael Biehn wasn't in their league. For a 1984 film, this film has a good number of action scenes, probably a good look of the future world and the robots are good looking.<br/><br/>This villain in the film (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is one of the famous villains ever and that stands a strong point in the film, along with the story and the acting but it wasn't all that great as a classic but you'll have fun when watching the movie."

Arnold (I'm more used to seeing him as a good guy) just didn't have it. Michael Biehn was the highlight of the movie.  That guy should've been famous.

"fernandoschiavi","8","0","0","21 May 2020"," ""The Terminator"" is, without a doubt, a modern landmark in science fiction cinema and, why not, a cinematographic landmark independent of genres
","""The Terminator"" is, without a doubt, a modern landmark in science fiction cinema and, why not, a cinematographic landmark independent of genres, alongside other works of the size of ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"", the classic ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Behind an unprecedented and even frightening concept - of a future dominated by machines - mainly if transported to the current reality in which technology increasingly assumes new roles in people's daily lives. The work of visionary James Cameron, who wrote the script alongside Gale Ann Hurd (another visionary) who was responsible for the final format of the work - there were two Terminators from the future, one made of liquid metal, which was cut to reduce costs and then famously reused in the sequel. This film was one of the first to present the perfect balance between action and pure science fiction (not fantasy as is the case with Star Wars), challenging definitions and the barriers of the genre. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates that creativity and inventiveness will always, under any circumstances, be able to overcome budget constraints.
The script is a master of narrative economy and deceptive simplicity. It is a masterpiece of efficiency to convey very interesting concepts about time travel and the resulting paradoxes. In the same way, without resorting to much exposure (some is necessary and inevitable), we learn details about the painful life of Kyle Reese (Biehn), soldier of the future who is sent to the past to protect Sarah Connor from a cyborg sent by the machines to kill the mother of the future leader of the rebellion against the machines. While rejecting the cyborg attacks, Kyle is guiding not only Sarah, but us spectators as well, through the bases that support the film. For example, Cameron intelligently makes him tell a good part of the details of the future in an interrogation to the police, a simple exposition that gives us the necessary knowledge about the gears that move tomorrow. Gradually, we realize that Kyle will have an importance beyond the protection of Sarah's life, as he will play another key role in the war against Skynet. In these few exhibition scenes, it is possible to convey the whole idea of a dark future caused by a nuclear war, and which is dominated by machines, which take humans to extermination camps. The first infiltrated robots had rubber skin and were easy to identify, but then more real skins, blood and everything were made to make them more human, so dogs had to be used to identify them. It still shows the remaining humans living hidden, underground, dirty, hungry (even rats are eating to survive), with John Connor his only hope. We see Reese's past (or would it be the future?) In flashbacks (or flash-forwards, if you look at it chronologically) perfectly stitched into the plot and visually inserted by Cameron with original and smooth transitions, now as a dream, now as a ""bedtime story"".<br/><br/>The immersion in Sarah Connor's drama is total since we see her free, light and loose on her scooter, with a smile on her face. We want to know what those two men who appeared just before want with her. Who is the villain? What kind of story is being told? Dropper revelations - but never slow or sluggish - make up for any problems that exist even today with special effects. Only after about forty minutes did we begin to know the story behind the persecutions and first deaths revealed in the script. The pace of the film is also helped by the work of Mark Goldblatt, who oscillates between action and calm, with long cuts that never hinder the understanding of the action. Adam Greenberg's photograph, darkened to mask the problems in the visual effects, but well designed to maintain suspense, has no outbursts of creativity only that works to convey the idea of hopelessness that Cameron needed. Both in violent Los Angeles in 1984 and in the future without much hope for the human race.
The soundtrack by Brad Fiedel (Terminator 2 and True Lies) is heavily dependent on synthesizers to convey inhuman aspects, even strange to the narrative, with the iconic opening song. Although the composition does not vary much (including the love scene between Reese and Sarah has a more romantic version of the theme), it fulfills its role well and transports us that story and emphasizes that climate of robots, future, artificial and futuristic intelligence. They are somewhat metallic / synthesized compositions.<br/><br/>The cast is also certainly one of the great assets of the production. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn, in the same way, show a perfect chemistry, as they pass the urgency, fear and anxiety that their roles need. The character of the actress gradually leaves the position of victim, assuming the place that the future holds for her, that of parent and guide of the messiah who will lead humanity against the machines. Schwarzenegger - who was never a good actor - on the other hand, already showed all his charisma on the scene. And, like a murdering cyborg, he definitely found his home, even making his strong Austrian accent function in some way like a robot's voice, perhaps because of the strangeness it causes. The cyborg is losing the apparent humanity represented by the flesh and sage that cover its mechanisms. Thus, Kyle and Sarah expose attack after attack, the antagonist who, as we know, follows different paths in the sequences.<br/><br/>However, it is important to emphasize that, despite dealing with a theme that refers to the future and advanced technologies, it is clear that James Cameron's work has not aged well over time, both technologically and in fashion and customs, being an authentic example of a film from the 1980s. Throughout the film, we have numerous peculiarities that become curious these days, which even ends up taking a little out of focus of the plot itself, generating even awe in the audience. We see on the scene phone books being used to locate people's phone addresses, giant walkmans used to listen to the music of the time, mentions of checkbooks, landlines in the middle of the streets and in homes and establishments (we had to buy a card to make connection), pagers, analog televisions, VCRs that allowed recording and watching recordings. I still mention the sound effects of the bullets of the revolvers very typical of western American films and fashion in general. The clothes and hair, especially those of women, leave no doubt that we are located many decades ago.<br/><br/>Another factor that does not negate the time of filming is the practical and visual effects. The film was produced after two films of the revolutionary ""Star Wars"" in terms of spectral effects. Not that the effects of the space franchise are excellent (like the beings assembled by Luke Skywalker and Han Solo just before the battle of Hoth in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", launched four years earlier), but what we see is of a lower level. In the scenes in which the Terminator Model 101 makes self-repairs and prepares to continue its mission to eliminate Sarah Connor, the prostheses molded from Schwarzenegger's head, face and arm are clear. We are clearly faced with prosthetics who cannot pass the necessary realism to believe that. What to say then when the Exterminator, already only in its metallic exoskeleton, starts a chase in a shed behind Reese and Sarah Connor? Although the metal model works with the camera still (even if head movement is totally limited), the same cannot be said of when the exoskeleton needs to move. The movements are extremely artificial based on stop motion techniques. It is curious to think that the film, as it was originally conceived, would not work today, except obviously the fictional plot that remains the most interesting and thought-provoking. It would be necessary to completely reinvent the script in search of new solutions for the situations presented throughout the film. Of course, for a world accustomed to the (boring and banal) effects in computer graphics, really what we see in Terminator is outdated. But this is not the way to measure such a film. It must be seen for its quality at the time and for the time it lasted as a cutting edge work, especially if, in this calculation, we take into account the limited budget available. In addition, I challenge someone to review the sequences in which the cyborg T-800 repairs itself in an apartment without shivering and looking away even for a hundredth of a second. It is the magic of cinema.<br/><br/>But the dated effects, of course, do not in any way detract from the merits of this James Cameron masterpiece, especially for the concept behind the film. The action scenes are incredible and memorable. How to forget the iconic scenes from Terminator 101 and Kyle Reese arriving transported from the future to the present day? There is also a hunt inside a bar, inside a parking lot, inside the house where Sarah lived with her colleague Ginger (Bess Motta) and even inside a roadside motel room and a police station with dozens of police officers facing in vain the virtually indestructible machine of the future. We also see mind-boggling pursuits through the dark and dangerous streets of Los Angeles with motorbikes, cars and even trucks.<br/><br/>The film is a product of its time and was a landmark in science fiction cinema. ""The Terminator"" was acclaimed by the specialized critics at the time of its release and the film is seen by critics and the general public as one of the precursors of the science fiction genre. Given its importance for cinema, it was selected in 2008, by the United States Library of Congress, to be preserved in the National Film Registry, being considered ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"". In addition, the film was responsible for the consolidation of Arnold Schwarzenegger's career and for raising James Cameron, who until then had only directed two films, to another level in Hollywood cinema."

","So I kind of did a double feature that worked incredibly well. War games and then this movie. Both are really about humanity and machine. I've heard the sequel is better then the first on this franchise, but I went into this with admittedly pretty high expectations. The movie delivers on the Sci-Fi thriller and crime story pretty well. The casting of Arnold is amazing and for the most part the special effects don't hamper it. Parts of it are supposed to be a bit tongue and cheek and I think it's done pretty well. The romance gets a bit strange but it isn't front and centre so much that you notice it too much. I found all the action and chase scenes to be pretty damn cool. I do think the world could have been built up a bit more. Since the story is all about the world being so bad they have to send a Terminator back to that humans never take over. We get a bit of development of it later on but it's not a whole amount. Still, super solid great action Sci-Fi movie with some great lines and even a bit of comedy."

","The Terminator is, without a doubt, one of the most iconic science-fiction movies of all-time. It may not be my favorite (it's still high up on my list), but there is no denying the influence the film had for filmmakers and moviegoers alike. The studio, Orion, originally saw this film as a flop, but it was moderately successful on a limited budget. It spawned a sequel that brought the property to a mass audience, which it turn created more sequels of varying degrees of success. Even in today's world, this is a beloved film that has a wide audience.<br/><br/>The film brought forth the Hollywood careers of many people. The top of the list is director James Cameron. It took people time to see he was the real deal. With the tight budget given to him, Cameron was able to make most of what he had. His movie, which he also wrote, has some very dark themes. What will the world look like with the rapid acceleration of technology and what would happen if there was nuclear war? I think Cameron answers these questions very well, which may also be one of the reasons why the film resonates in the mind of viewers today.<br/><br/>I love the look and the design of the movie. Most of the filming took place at night hence the darkness. The special effects may be outdated in today's terms, but keep in mind there was a small budget. Still, they are good enough to make the scenes believable. I still remember seeing The Terminator and Kyle Reese appear on screen, from the future, with those lightning bolts and Brad Fiedel's amazing theme. This could have been cheesy in the hands of a lesser director, but Cameron made it work. Unlike subsequent sequels, he made an incredibly wise choice to shoot the film like a horror thriller. Yeah, there are very intense, horrific moments here to behold. Those robots look really intense and scary.<br/><br/>In the year 2029, the entire world has been conquered by manmade machines. These machines send a ruthless assassin, known as the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 Los Angeles, where his mission is to kill the person who holds the key to the future of mankind; Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). The human resistance sends one of their own, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to 1984 to stop the cyborg from completing his mission. The Terminator will not stop until his mission is complete and he will destroy anyone and anything that stands in his way.<br/><br/>The acting can be clunky at times, but it works in everyone's favor. Despite the success of Conan the Barbarian, Cameron was hesitant in hiring Schwarzenegger. The casting worked out in everyone's favor though. He only had seventeen lines of dialogue and they were delivered in a robotic voice, which is, you know, perfect for a robot. His intimidation and presence are what makes his character so unique. When we are introduced to him, we see him go up against the dumb punk leader (played by a wonderful, young Bill Paxton) and give him a much-deserved beatdown. That is how we know Arnold was the right man. This is Michael Biehn's first big role and he has some great moments of dialogue. I was on the fence with Linda Hamilton. On one hand, her character irked me in the beginning. But as the movie progresses, I warmed up to her character and was rooting for her by the film's end. There are some solid supporting roles from Dick Miller and Lance Henriksen.<br/><br/>The music is another reason why we are enthralled and captivated. This is Fiedel's first film score, and Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd almost passed on him due to his inexperience, but he was able to show them how talented he is. The synth score and those drums combine to create one of the most iconic scores of all time. Yep, it is something that you can easily hum.<br/><br/>The success of The Terminator surprised everyone in 1984. Should it really considering the talent of the people behind the film? Science fiction was not big on Hollywood's mind despite the success of Alien and Star Wars. The genre will begin to make a comeback thanks to the aforementioned films and this one. James Cameron rose to the A-list director list and Schwarzenegger became a superstar and his line ""I'll be back"" is the line that everyone loves to imitate including myself. I really, really enjoyed this sci-fi action/horror flick. It is violent, has many great lines, zips along at a fast pace, and one of those films you will remember as an instant classic.<br/><br/>My Grade: A"
"MGPT80","9","0","0","6 May 2020"," This is what an action film should look like
","Without doubt, one of the best films ever made in the sci-fi action genre. The Terminator is incredibly atmospheric, with impressive special effects for the era and a menacing score. Schwarzenegger is perfectly utilised and could not be a better fit for the role. Linda Hamilton also gives a strong performance, developing rapidly and authentically from girl-next-door to cyborg-destroyer in a very short space of time. We also see one of the few sex scenes in a blockbuster film that has genuine feeling to it, resulting from a delicately engineered chemistry between Hamilton and Michael Biehn. Compared to the cluttered flamboyant action films that have preceded it, Terminator is clean, minimalist and unpretentious. A genuine classic."

","The Terminator, the first film of the terminator series, which is a 36-year-old series, still manages to be a traceable quality film even though it was produced in 1984. At that time, he was one of the best science fiction movies with Star Wars and Alien. In 2029, terminators take over the world. Terminators are intelligent robots made of almost immortal strong metal, bullet proof and human skin. John Connor, on the other hand, is able to kill these terminators thanks to the technology he finds and he fights against the terminators with the people who are left behind. He returns to the past with a time machine on the terminator and tries to kill Sarah Connor, his mother, so that John Connor was never born. The scenario is briefly like this. First of all, although the movie is a 36-year-old movie, it does not reveal it at all. The terminator character is both realistic and puts the name's weight. Arnold Schwarzenegger is cut out for the terminator role. Overall, the player selections are successful. The script is also beautifully detailed and beautifully rendered. The voiceover fits well into the characters. Music is suitable for the theme of the movie. The only thing that gets stuck in my head comes from the future of Kyle and is John Connor's father in the future. How did John Connor know that Kyle was his father, or if he made a mistake and sent someone else out of Kyle into the past, he would never have been born. Maybe they will elaborate a bit more in the next movie of the series, I hope this subject. Watch it right away if you haven't. My score for the film is 100/77"

","Now to talk of it as great film, to compare it with American Beauty might seem idiotic--it's an almost unrelentingly dark, violent, frightening action movie, after all--but strip away the relentless action, strip away the technophobia, strip away the blatant dislike of cops and modern youth, strip away the poignant love story and, at its core, it's about an immature, essentially mindless girl becoming a strong, determined woman. That's a theme more movies should have if we want girls to have strong role models.<br/><br/>In the course of a few hours during which Sarah Connor realises that she is running for her life from a soul-less machine in human flesh that is implacably and violently determined to kill her, she transforms from a girl who can't balance her cheque book to a woman who can order a wounded, beaten man to ""get on your feet, soldier."" She is clear-headed, not panicky, focused in crisis and incredibly courageous. And it's not that she has lost her essential femaleness but that she's grown up.<br/><br/>It's relentless, heartless violence appals and fascinates me. It's gritty depiction of our society as a prelude to an even more horrific one in 2023 darkens my heart. It's quickly developing love story touches me. Its humor makes the dark places in me smile. But most of all I am touched and fascinated by Sarah's precipitous transformation. As a good life exercise, ask yourself this: Would you have the courage to do what she does?"
"tankace","8","0","0","18 July 2016"," Post Apocalypse from robot 101.
","We, humans, have imagined for centuries who the world would be in the future. This is one of the most usual setting for science fiction and the most common of that variety is the post-apocalyptic future, in which all things more or less goes to hell and humans have to survive in the wreckage of our fallen civilization. Now there have been many interpretations of that kid over the years in books, television series, comic books and most prominently in films. <br/><br/>Now Terminator isn't the first science fiction film in a post apocalyptic world, far from it there have been dozens of them with some of the most well known up to its opening in 1984 be Logan's Run, Silent Running, Soylent Green, Blade Runner and Time Machine (1960). So what made to stand out of the crown?<br/><br/>First it is the story ,which goes like this, in the future machines have rise up and we are in a war against them for survivor and dominance of the planet. During it Machines send back in time a robot, made to look like a human, a Terminator in order to kill Sarah Connor the mother of the leader of the resistance Jon, before she gives birth to him. For that the Resistance send also a human back to the same date in order to prevent the robot from its goal!<br/><br/>The story was one of the most original at the time for it made a revolutionary change to the Post Apocalypse: use time travel as a weapon, back in 1984 this idea was ground breaking for none have though up to that point ""Why not kill the future at its root?. One other thing that was added was hardcore action in the mix and the result was so successful that after this flick many movies and comic books were written using this style, with 12 Monkeys and X-men Days of Future Past been just two examples.<br/><br/>In short the movie rocks, the action rocks , the effects are awesome ,apart from one scene and I think that was the first movie to make the Predestination Paradox famous. Also the fact that from 1984 and beyond robot killing machine look much more threatening doesn't hurt either for before 1984 all robot looked like radios on legs!<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it ,do it and if you believe that Terminator Genisys was a shame to the Terminator Logo ,we are on the same side!!"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In the year 2029, mankind is in a desperate battle with The Machines, that have risen from the ashes of the last war. Through a time travelling portal, exceptional soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) has travelled back in time to the year 1984, to protect Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will be the mother of John Connor, the leader of the Resistance. But Skynet, the computer defence system that set the machines on the world, has sent its own agent along, in the shape of The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a robotic soldier fitted with human flesh that is programmed to complete its mission at all costs.<br/><br/>Re-released (in selected theatres) earlier this year to coincide with the release of the far inferior, effects driven Terminator: Genysis, fans of the franchise were taken back to where it all began, the rollicking roller-coaster ride, with breath taking special effects (for the time), pulse pounding action sequences and a far fetched, but conversely intelligent and elaborate story that no doubt played a big part in making it stand the test of time. In 1984, The Terminator was simply unlike anything anyone had ever seen before, and today could serve as an abject lesson to the effects-over-substance brigade.<br/><br/>For anyone who never got in to the Conan films, this was the film that presented Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Mr. Universe champion turned actor, to the world. While not exactly oozing with what you'd call traditional acting talent, here his expressionless demeanour and cold, thick Austrian voice suited the skin of a cold blooded killer perfectly. He's no psychopath, though. He knows exactly what he's doing. Or, rather, what he's been programmed to do. And either him or his prey will have to be dead by the end for it to end. Sarah Connor's slow, dawning realization that her life is in danger is brilliantly orchestrated, after two women with the same name and the same age have already been dispatched and she becomes suspicious of everyone around her.<br/><br/>It all builds to an explosive (literally) finale, where the killing machine is stripped to its bare bones and pursues his already worn down assailants inside a factory. Although its one of many effects that look a bit sub par now, somehow the tension and terror is no less palpable. And Arnie's ""I'll be back"" line is still somehow cool and as welcome in pop culture circles as ever. *****"

","The Terminator is considered a breakthrough among the movies of its gender and it's undeniable that James Cameron has changed how the action movies were made with this film. The apprehension, the awareness as the terminator is getting closer to his objective, is really exciting and as the movie goes on, it only gets better. The visual effects, particularly the makeup used in Arnold Schwarzenegger to reveal some parts of the robotic skeleton beneath the human-tissue, are surprisingly good. The CGI, even being from the 80's so you can rapidly notice when the chroma key is being used, are fine and work very fine to me.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger as the terminator was really good, his gestures interpreting a robot managed to portray something without feelings through the lack of changes in facial expression regardless of what is happening, who has a single purpose and will not stop until achieve it. One of his iconic lines is firstly said in this movie. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn succeeded in making a remarkable performance that until now they have influence in the others who portray these characters in more recent movies. One aspect to be noticed is the stalking feeling, fear and powerlessness which Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) feel around them, having an almost indestructible creature looking for them."

Arnold. Arnold. That's right, use your Austrian accent. Arnold. I love, Arnold. Arnold, Schwarzenegger was the strongest selection on planet Earth to become the Terminator. Arnold is the Terminator. The Terminator launches Schwarzenegger's career into unprecedented superstardom. The Terminator is Schwarzenegger's most iconic role. ""I'll be back."" Linda Hamilton, too, is literally the best woman in the world to be Sarah Conner. She was born to play Sarah, and she has earned it. Michael Biehn has the star strength of a soldier. Biehn's tough to replace as Kyle Reese, the man sent back in time 50 years from the future on a succeed at all costs mission to protect Sarah Connor, the mother of her unborn child, John Connor, who is the leader of the human resistance against the machines far into the future, and yep, you guessed it, the machines sent back Arnold the Terminator to Sarah Connor's time to hunt her and kill her. The Terminator has a timeless battle of resourceful human soldier, Kyle Reese, vs. unstoppable killing machine, the Terminator. The Terminator has an innovative and groundbreaking story for its time. The Terminator is high conceptual cinema that's powerfully dramatic and happens to be a bit scary at times. Bill Paxton plays his role for the time making for more classic Cameron. One thing that really makes the Terminator special, that you wouldn't have known at the time, is that its sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is one of the all-time 50 best movies, and easily in the conversation of being the best sci-fi fantasy adventure, along with a few other Cameron greats, like Avatar, Aliens and The Abyss. T2 improves in all the right areas where T1 is minorly lacking. The Terminator very much feels like one extended and incomplete preview, yet, outstanding outing of the soon to be conceived and released, T2. I love The Terminator story, and I'm a big fan of all of the Terminator movies, especially T2. Arnold. ""I'll be back."""

This film I believe was what launched Arnold into movie stardom as well as Cameron who would both see continued success after this film. The Terminator was far from done as this film would spawn 3 sequels and an eventual fourth in years to come from now. An instant fan favorite, everything about this film is done right, the effects though aged were top notch of the time of its release, the action still gritty and in your face. The story though clichéd at certain instances, still has enough originality to make it special and something more than a simple action movie. The score fits perfectly within the mold of the film.

","I have seen the sequel more times that I can remember, and still love it, but I felt that I should return to the original and have a look at what that movie is like. I remember the first time I saw The Terminator - I was in high school and it was the grossest movie that I had ever seen. I say that because there is a scene where Arnie cuts open his arm and pops out his eye.<br/><br/>The Terminator was little more that a B-grade horror movie with a sci-fi bent, but its popularity meant that a sequel was made which became a block-buster action movie. I will try not the mention the sequel as this is the movie that made it possible, and in some ways it is better. As an action movie, Terminator II rocks, but it is basically a remake of the first movie as the themes are very much the same.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton is a happy young Sarah Conner who works at a fast-food restaurant and generally leads a pleasant life. Everything changes when some guy begins executing all of the Sarah Conner's in Los Angeles, and when she is about to be executed as well, her saviour Kyle Reese leaps out and saves her. Both are then chased around Los Angeles by an unmercilous killing machine before Sarah manages to crush it in a factory, though Reese has died in the process. During this time, Reese sleeps with Conner and conceives John Conner, the guy who leads the humans to victory in a war against the robots.<br/><br/>A lot of the things that I can say about this movie I have said in Terminator II because the themes are basically the same. It is a movie about how a life is saved through the death of another - Kyle Reese. It is about something that cannot be stopped, but it is stopped after Reese dies. I guess we know that Reese must die because he is in a place that is not his home, and he can never return. Okay, he loves Conner, but Los Angeles 1984 is not his home, and he cannot live here.<br/><br/>There is no struggle with this as the focus is more on the horror of having something after you that you cannot stop. It seems to reflect the horror of death - something that comes after us that we cannot stop. The only reason that Conner survived is that Reese, a battle-trained soldier, was sent back to save her. The only way we can flee the uncertainty of death, is to trust in Jesus, who was sent to save us. In a way this movie seems to reflect this.<br/><br/>The last thing that I must say about this movie is that it contains one of Hollywood's famous lines, and it is the line that made the movie - I'll be back - says Arnold Schwarzenegger to a desk sergeant before he drives a car through the door of the police station and shoots the place up. The fact that the Terminator droid is able to walk through a heavily armed police station and come out without a scratch simply shows how strong it is. Even then, Kyle is able to put a home-made bomb into his skeletal frame and blow it to bits."

","I have said it before - I am not one to fall in with the hype of a movie on the top 250 but Terminator has something about it, what? Partially it is the terror Schwarzenegger portrays (that he is able to survive just about anything, not talking about his acting). Partially it is the fact that in spite of its age it still remains timeless (except maybe the fashion) but mostly, its because of the entertaining script and the great execution of the plot.<br/><br/>The plot is a rather interesting premise and yet not complicated. A soldier is sent from the future to protect a woman - who will mother the leader of the human resistance of a machine vs human war - against a machine disguised as a man sent to kill her before he is even conceived.<br/><br/>I have to compliment how well the performances were. Linda Hamilton is a little overlooked in her role as Sarah and she does bring depth to the role as does Michael Biehn in his role as Kyle.<br/><br/>Any complaints about this film? When the second Sarah Connor died I would think that the police would try and bring in the remaining Sarah for protection. Its a bit of a small one but am I supposed to believe that after cops find a pattern emerging in a serial killer's ploy they do nothing? Overall I recommend if you want a well written sci-fi thriller."

","Terminator is a movie about one cyborg (machine) and a human that travel back in time to 1984 to Los Angeles, the cyborg is a Terminator; a killing machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and it is programed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton); and the human Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a resistance fighter sent to protect her. After killing two other Sarah Connors, the Terminator finally Track down it real target, the Sarah it was supposed to kill, he saw her in a nightclub, but she was rescued by Kyle. After rescuing her, Kyle explains to Sarah that she has to be killed by the Terminator because in the future a computer programing system ""Skynet"" loses a war against the humans, they wanted to control all humankind but they failed and the Leader of the human resistance was John Connor the son of Sarah Connor. The Terminator was supposed to kill Sarah before she gives birth to her son John. The theme of the movie I think is how precious human is; it can also be the creation, because a machine is created, it is also an action movie. There are many movies like Terminator, and one of them can be transformers because they have almost the same theme. Terminator is about machines trying to take over the world by killing all human (obstacle) on their way, and humans are contesting and fighting them. Transformers is about good and bad aliens. The good aliens are on the side of human and the bad ones are trying to destroy all humankind and desert the word. Like the machines in Terminator, theses aliens are trying to take over the earth. The aliens are the ""Transformers"". Both movies are violent. The music and camera angle are very well used in the movie, as there is action in the film the music always alert us when something is going to happen. It makes the movie more interesting and even more on suspense moments. The camera is always pointed at the right subject, it is always pointed at the terminator when it is going to kill and at the person it is killing. Humans don't realize how precious life is. We are destroying ourselves with technology we create ourselves. We die by our own hands. The theme is the creation because the killing machine created by human is coming back to kill us ""Humans"". The machine is trying to kill the woman that will give birth to the man that will kill machines."

Using all Corman's budget saving tricks, Cameron produced a film that at least to a viewer's initial viewing, looks like it had a much higher budget than it actually did - Much like Corman's AIC films of the 60's.<br/><br/>Now Terminator borrowed heavily from basic science fiction material, to the point where Harlan Ellison sued due to plot details similar to his short story ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" which was made into an Outer Limits episode - One of the earliest Science Fiction things I had ever seen, I was maybe 4 years old when I saw Demon with a Glass Hand. I did notice the similarities, but basically I did not care. You can also see elements which may have been influenced by the short story ""All you Zombies"" by the dean of science fiction, Robert Anson Heinlein. The Terminator then, borrowed from both of these sources. I was not surprised to learn later that Harlan Ellision sued to get story recognition put on the credits of the film, this was a very Ellision thing to do- Cameron should have done this in the first place though, you can't just borrow parts of plots from Hugo Award winning science fiction stories - And Cameron did it again in Avatar, borrowing the main plot elements of Poul Anderson's ""Call me Joe"" (Guy in a wheelchair, spinal injury, moon of a superjovian planet, remote controlling a genetically created body on the surface of said moon and eventual transfer into that body), and since Poul Anderson passed in 2008, I'd say Cameron released Avatar just in time, eh? But he did not get away with it in 1984, as he was a fledgling director at the time. What Cameron did, was blend these borrowed items, and he created a new piece of work. Now, it never bothers me that film writers borrow from all over, in 1984 Cameron was made to put the acknowledgment into the film, and I am glad for that, because as I was sitting in the theatre, I was thinking, ""This guy reads a LOT of Science Fiction"" - And as his taste was just like mine, I wholly enjoyed seeing the material used.<br/><br/>Now what nobody really knew was how immensely popular this film would become, basically shadowing Arnold Schwarzenegger to this date with ""I'll be Back"" and other quotes- Actually The Terminator is responsible for creating a whole subculture based on some of the phrases from the film. But what The Terminator really did was create a launching point for a Franchise.<br/><br/>This film was a milestone for Special Effects Animatronix Wizard Stan Winston - Who created a whole working mechanical Arnold for a lot of the shots which reveal Terminator internal workings. When you view Terminator in 2011, these effects look rather primitive - What people have to realise that in 1984, nothing like that had ever been done before. This put both Cameron and Winston on the map from then on. Also we can thank Tom Woodruff, Jr, who has operated Winston (and other creatures) effects from the 80's through the 2010's.<br/><br/>This film also made use of unknown actors, Michael Beihn, Linda Hamilton, the three punks Brad Reardon, Brian Thompshon (The Shape Changing Alien from X-Files) and of course the great Bill Paxton. And of course this was the breakthrough for Arnold even more than ""Conan the Barbarian""... More people identify Arnie as The Terminator rather than any role where he basically ran around in a loincloth.<br/><br/>Now, I really don't care that Cameron basically borrowed material from several Hugo-Award Winning Science Fiction Authors, because nobody was USING that material, and any films made from material by those greats (A Boy and His Dog) were done poorly... Now here is a director not afraid to take this source material and make it LOOK the way it was written in these classic Sci-Fi stories, and so what we have here, is Part One of a now-Quadrilogy of great Sci Fi stories - This first installment set the basic foundation, and what has been done, is that Cameron is now responsible for creating a new kind of American Mythology based on these ""borrowed"" concepts of Time Travel, Cyborg Soldier, Grandfather Paradox (Ie - Man goes back in time, becomes his own grandfather). Just as Lord of the Rings was created by JRR Tolkein to become a new kind of British Folklore, The Terminator has become part of An American Folklore. And ""in 100 years, who is going to care"" that Cameron raided the refrigerators of Heinlien, Asimov, (Martin) Caiden* Ellison, and Anderson?<br/><br/>*(aka, writer of Cyborg, originator of the phrase and creator of the 6 million dollar man)"
"Velociraptor256","8","0","0","5 September 2010"," Dark, fascinating and pretty much brilliant
","James Cameron's first full stint as a director, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's first time in his most famous role, is still definitely a worthwhile watch, though not without its flaws. Thanks to its cinematography and particularly good soundtrack, this movie has a great atmosphere, dark and frightening and not for the faint-hearted. The action scenes are good for the 1980s at least, but some of the special effects for the Terminator look a bit dated these days: for example, in one scene, the use of an obvious animatronic head that doesn't even really look like Arnold.<br/><br/>While it's occasionally slow, the story is well-written and generally gripping, backed up well by the actors: Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are excellent as the human heroes, but of course it's Arnold who steals the show as the Terminator, bringing real menace to it simply by his presence and expressions, since he doesn't have much dialogue in this film.<br/><br/>The Terminator is definitely a film to check out - and if you enjoy it, make sure you find time for the sequel too."

","Sarah Connor is a young woman living in Los Angeles who is suddenly attacked by a mysterious man who seems to be impervious to bullets. Sarah is rescued by Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future who explains that she is being pursued by a Terminator, a cyborg assassin who will stop at nothing until it kills her <br/><br/>This gripping, eye-popping, fast paced action/sci-fi hybrid is one of the best thrillers of the eighties, with one of the most memorable villains in all cinema. It's a terrific story which slam-dunks the bewildered heroine into the middle of a fight for survival against a backdrop of nuclear apocalypse. Like all the best suspense pictures, it follows a straight minimalist route; Reese sets the action with a brilliant speech, ""Listen, and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead !"". As this fearsome assassin, Big Arnie is simply perfect casting - his best role by a long chalk which suits his looks, his acting chops, everything. He cruises the city, a mean machine stalking his prey, and is a truly frightful fiend. Hamilton and Biehn are equally good; she is vulnerable and scared but not stupid and their resolve to outwit and survive near-impossible odds give the film a real dramatic core. The support cast are a lot of fun; Winfield and Henriksen do a nice Mutt and Jeff cop routine which is welcome light relief and there are funny bits by Miller as a gun shop clerk and Paxton as a street punk. The movie also has a terrific neo-noir atmosphere, thanks to Adam Greenberg's photography of L.A. at night, punctuated by hellish futuristic visions of irradiated rubble patrolled by nightmarish machines. Brad Fiedel's score, whilst occasionally a bit cheesy, has a great main theme and pumps everything along with pounding electronic percussion. The movie was written by Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, and fans cite it as a pioneering story of time travel and machine dystopia, although in practice it has many antecedents - sci-fi author Harlan Ellison sued the film for it similarities to his 1957 short story Soldier From Tomorrow, but there are also very similar Dr Who yarns, not to mention the last half-hour of Michael Crichton's Westworld. All of this doesn't matter however - what the film has going for it is good characterisation, fabulous direction, and a great Bad Man. Produced by Helmdale Films, who made some great flicks in the late eighties (Salvador, A Breed Apart, Miracle Mile), it was made on a pretty tight six-million budget but it looks ten times that and is sensational entertainment from start to finish."

"DrEbert","Null","0","0","13 August 2004"," An acquired taste, but a brilliant one
","In the modern day of high-tech special effects and digital sound, a film like ""The Terminator"" can seem a bit outdated and even cheesy. I must admit that I only really started to appreciate it after watching it the third time. (Mind you, the first time was when I was 12, before I was old enough to appreciate anything, and the second time was one week after I saw ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" which somewhat spoiled me with its awesome CGI effects.)<br/><br/>What gives this film greatness is not its action or effects, both of which are representative of the style of the 1980's, a style that is not as effective today. The greatness of ""The Terminator"" comes from its ingenious storyline. Sure, any fool could create a story about a robot from the future coming back to kill someone. But that is a serious oversimplification of this film. The storyline that it develops about the nuclear war that will occur in our future and the machines taking over and all of that are all sci-fi genius. The basic elements that are laid out in this film are later elaborated on and solidified in ""Terminator 2"" (and, to a lesser extent, in ""Terminator 3"").<br/><br/>This film not only set Arnold Schwarzenegger's career on its course but started a new era of science fiction and initiated the saga of a bleak and not-so-impossible future for humanity."

","In 1997, there will be a nuclear war. Skynet, a computer, becomes self-aware and the machines dominate the world. Humans suffer from their ruling immensely. But one man teaches the rest of them how to fight back and they eventually win. His name is John Connor.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a young, gentle waitress who lives in 1984 has become the target of termination, and a cyborg called The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent from 2029 to assassinate her, so the existence of her unborn son, John Connor, will be entirely wiped out. One soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) has also been sent from the future by John Connor to protect Sarah. Now The Terminator is out there, after Sarah, and her life is about to be changed forever...<br/><br/>For the film industry, 'The Terminator' is very inspiring, regarding its special effects and even the idea of time travel- 'Twelve Monkeys''s concept upon time travel and what eventually happens to the hero is very similar to the one of 'The Terminator'. For 1984, the visual effects are amazing. Although the second and the third Terminator flicks have even more powerful technology, this one is still the most original among the three. The action scenes are stunning, the suspense is always there, quite spine-chilling, and surprisingly, there is even romantic chemistry- which is rather interesting. AND the acting is good. Not to mention the dazzling directing by James Cameron- highly recommended."

","Master storyteller James Cameron, brings to the big screen one of its most memorable characters. Although not his original intention for the role, we are all thankful that an agreement was reached to have Arnold play the role of the Terminator rather than the protector, Kyle Reese. This casting proved to be the crucial element that ultimately gave the franchise the ability to continue for many years to come. No disrespect to Lance Henrikson who eventually found a role almost tailor made for him, that of the man with a dubious gift in Millennium'. The movie is also testimony to the art of screenwriting giving us rich characters, an original story and insurmountable obstacles for our heroes.<br/><br/>The task of commenting on The Terminator' is hardly a grinding task. Besides the fact that it is such an enjoyable movie, there is not much to complain about in terms of its craft. Many successful movies are a product of having the writer and director as being one and the same. The writer is able to create a visual form of his own text and the end product is his own vision. There would have been few problems here of scenes not adding value to the story or the image not bringing the character fully to life. These skills are not always endowed to the moviemaker, but it is heaped on in Cameron's case.<br/><br/>Right from the first scene, we start to realise that this is more than an above average action movie. The inciting scene indeed gives momentum to the story. We see the apocalyptic future and fully grasp the dark, foreboding threat of the machines. The genocidal machines crush the skeletal remains as they advance relentlessly without emotion, doing only want they were programmed to do  wipe out the resistance. The narrator voice has a tone of impending doom thus heightening the sense of tragedy. The story is set in motion for the battle to continue back in time, our time. This phenomenal piece of writing is also included in the tagline. Almost bordering on cheesiness, but it is so well done, it gets away with it.<br/><br/>The characters are all of purpose each with defining characteristics that bring the character to life. Sarah Conner is the sweet, innocent waitress battling to cope with life in general. Hardly a sterling foundation for the mother of the future! This does succeed in making her more vulnerable to the Terminator and the vast differences in their character help to set the story of our unwilling heroine against the seemingly indestructible machine. As the character develops and the final confrontation is at hand, she realises her destiny and rises to the challenge. Linda Hamilton is also well cast here, in fact, superbly. She has a look of innocence about her that changes to one of menacing determination, a switch done with believability  a trait necessary for the translation of the character of the story. Indeed her presence was missed in the third movie, no matter how charismatic Arnie is.<br/><br/>Then we have Arnold as the Terminator. If ever there was a role suited to an actor, we have the prime example here. Arnold has the name that shouts action. He has a thick Austrian accent that sounds distinctly robotic whenever he uses it. Arnold does not speak much here. He didn't need to since we were all ears whenever a line exited his lips. Remember I'll be back'. His massive frame served to accentuate the indestructible nature of the character. If ever Sarah had a worst nightmare, it would seem a cakewalk next to this guy. In summary, Arnold had all the necessary traits for this character and it has quite rightly become his signature role.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn is a regular in a Cameron production and plays the role of Reese very well. We can see that this is a man who has suffered and his determination not only stems from a deep  set hatred of the machines, but from his love for the woman who will be one of the leaders of the resistance. Being slight of frame making him look more like a lean soccer player makes him less of a challenge for the Terminator. In fact, even though he knows he has to ultimately face the machine, the best he can do is run. He always seems to be clawing onto survival and in the end he dies in the final stand against the machine.<br/><br/>It would of course be impossible to say that I had satisfactorily completed my comments without a mention of the scene at the police station. This scene is the Terminator's defining scene. It is here that we see him for the cold, heartless, single  minded killer that he is. It all starts with Arnold's most memorable line and then the doors crash in as the Terminator careens into the station with his stolen car. The machine sets about his task with ruthless intent. He shoots anything that gets in his way as he searches for his prime objective. This is all he exists for and it is all he is programmed for. Like personal computers that process its input commands, he follows his input command regardless of all that stand in his way. After all, he is a Terminator so it is as they said in the sequel  nothing personal.<br/><br/>The story is uncomplicated, but nonetheless stimulating. Several science fiction concepts are used here, namely, time travel and machine dominance. This blend ensures sufficient obstacles for our heroes and it is also interesting to note that the Mcguffin is not Sarah, but her unborn child. This also creates a sound opening for the second movie that picks up on this in the future where another chase is on, not for the mother but for the young John Conner. The story ensures that the violence is meaningful  a machine programmed to kill would relentlessly pursue its target vanquishing all before it. Nothing to tease the brain, but the craft and intent in the story ensures that the audience is fully engrossed in the movie.      <br/><br/>
As man advances with computer technology, the more relevant this story will become. That is why the story was able to continue and audience demand grew. Science fiction takes a known scientific concept and dramatises it. The concept of machine autonomy has now graced our screens in two monster productions  The Terminator' and The Matrix'. The reality of machines in our lives today goes beyond our conscious and ignites our unconscious fears, that is, the fear of losing control of our world and of ourselves. These deep-rooted fears manifest themselves as inspiration for movies such as this. This is not such a bad thing since master storytellers are able to exploit these ancient fears and deliver sublime entertainment that will continue to provide enjoyment across the generations."

","Ask yourself one question.  When you're working on a relatively low budget with limited time, how much edge will your film have?  Probably a lot when the pressure is on.  That is what makes 'The Terminator' the best of all the terminator movies.  ARNOLD HAS EDGE.  The phenomenal editing has the most edge in the entire film and James Cameron's career, along with Arnold's was made.  Watch the second film and see how much of it actually has a lot of slow and dragging spots such as the time spent resting in the desert with the nightmare nuclear dream sequence.  Half an hour could have easily been trimmed from the original theatrical release of T2.  T3 was made simply to keep Arnold's career from fading completely away.

"thebigmovieguy","Null","0","0","15 July 2003"," The movie that inspired ""The matrix""
","Every big fan of the ""Terminator"" saga knows that this movie helped inspire popular movies like the matrix, which is why this movie is so good. Back in 1984, James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" brought a unique approach to the science-fiction genre with this original popcorn action/sci-fi flick. This movie has long since reached the status of a cult classic as well as it's follower, ""T2 : Judgment Day"". It's probably a little too soon to be calling ""T3 : Rise of the machines"" a classic. I hope it'll become one in the near future. Even though both these sequels are excellent, ""The Terminator"" has some sort of class unseen in the sequels.<br/><br/>Here are a few good things about ""The Terminator"" :<br/><br/>1. THE STORY Unseen before in previous movies. The future calls for help in the past. A warrior is sent to protect a woman to assure the safety of humanity in the far future.<br/><br/>2. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS Stan ""The man"" Winston is visually creative with all those unbelievable effects he presented in the movie : 1) The scenes of an apocalyptic world 2) The terminator operates on himself 3) The killing machine walking down the street.<br/><br/>3. THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton) goes from a naive waitress to a very strong woman (as seen in T2) and Kyle Reese (played by Michael Biehn) is not your ordinary type of hero. He's also strong an never quits believing in freedom and the end of the war against the machines. Sarah and Kyle eventually fall in love. Finally, the terminator (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a perfect predator and villain who hasn't been played so well by other actors.<br/><br/>4. THE SCRIPT AND DIRECTION I personaly think that James Cameron is a sci-fi genius (as seen in ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"" and ""T2""). In this picture (actually his first), Cameron wrote an original screenplay and directed it as a movie, bringing a very dark approach to the sci-fi genre and crafting a world of terror where machines control humans. He also wrote funny unforgettable one liners like ""I'll be back"". This is indeed his best picture.<br/><br/>5. THE VIOLENCE/GORE is wisely used to show off a darker aspect of terror and being in danger. Without the violence, it's uncertain if ""The Terminator"" would be as good.<br/><br/>These five things are pretty hard to describe because everyone feels different about something. This is how I feel about this movie. It's a fun ride to hell where you'll be kept on the edge of your seat as the plot unfolds the terrible destiny awaiting humanity. <br/><br/>The cast and crew did a great job on this movie. Big Arnold is frightening, Linda is gorgeous and Michael is unbelievably good. Here's a piece of James Cameron's imagination. I hope everyone can find something they like in this movie no matter what genre you're interested in. Watch this movie again and again and again. It's the kind that gets better and better. I rate it a great big 10."

","A very good Sci-fi film, and a fantastic entry into the filmmaking world for James Cameron.  The Terminator brings together some of the greatest visuals ever to be seen from a, at that time, no name director fighting desperately to keep his career afloat with a pretty minute budget.  Though special effects have far transcended this film, very few have better directed the special effects techniques than James Cameron.  I would argue that The Terminator was the most ambitious sci-fi film since the original Star Wars premiered less five or so years before, and very few films come to mind in the past twenty years who'd give either a run for their money in terms of ambition.    <br/><br/>Even though most of the effects and their creation method identified, it truly was some amazing material in 1983/84.  But it's not the stop motion or anamatronic endoskeleton that people take with them from this film, it's not the techniques themselves used to create the effects  it's the visionary behind it that sticks with the viewer.  How the shot comes together and jumps right out of Cameron's portfolio, well executed by Fantasy II, Stan Winston, and their respective crews. But visual signature alone won't make a film.  While not the greatest drama/emotional premise to come around, the Terminator sports a more convincing tale and depth than your average sci-fi film with many intriguing and original twists turns and morphs of standard formula driven plots, fun with paradoxical timelines, a love across time, the slasher killer who won't die, all rolled up into one and thrown our way in an ever-moving package.<br/><br/>Acting fares from typical Sci-fi par to some impressive performances, and most of the main characters do surprisingly well-Biehn, Hamilton, and Schwarzenegger.  The always fun Lance Henrikson has a small but worthwhile role.  Most of the lesser performances come from smaller characters, but the world James Cameron has painted is so well conceived and so inviting that unless everything from production on down stunk, you'll forgive it. <br/><br/>
Brad Fiedel's score is on par with the acting.  In places, it's typical synth-conceived sci-fi, but the score's highlight comes from its stalker mechanical/heartbeat theme associated with the Terminator himself, and its now famous main theme which, interestingly, finds its most powerful moment when performed only on piano for Reese and Connor's intimate moments together.  And, fortunately, Fiedel would return almost ten years down the road to bring us the excellent score for Judgment Day.<br/><br/>Not so surprisingly, The Terminator has transcended time, and still remains one of the greatest sci-fi films anyone can lend their time and imagination to."

","O.k., that is kind of a cheesy opening, but my point is that this movie works as a love story almost as much as it does as an action movie.  It is an amazing movie, maybe one of the ten best I have ever seen.  It gets better with time.  Its few critics here, it seems, just want to blow up the eighties.  Good luck.  Instead, try making some memorable films today so that this isn't thought of as the empty period of popular movies.  For example, people are praising and praising Lord of the Rings The Two Towers and even the latest Star Wars, mainly because our expectations have slipped. Compare those two movies to Terminator. Granted, the evil, dog-like humanoid war creatures in The Two Towers are amazing and scary as hell, but that, along with a little suspense in the battle scenes, is about it.  As scary as the Two Towers creatures are, Terminator himself was equally scary, and there is just so much more in terms of character development and prolonged suspense.  As for the new Star Wars and its phony CGI effects, there is no reason to even compare it to Terminator.  My point is that popular, mainstream movies are a reflection of the time period.  Terminator reflects well on the eighties.  (Terminator II was good, but it is probably an 8 at most, somehwere around Two Towers' neighborhood, slightly below The Fellowship of the Ring, which at least had emotion and character development, slightly above the latest Star Wars.  Terminator is a ten)."

","Highly enjoyable, well-directed, and evenly scripted foray into the nature of time and what could happen if earlier events were tampered with in the future.  The movie opens...you know all that stuff I am sure.  I find the whole idea of changing spatial realities fascinating.  Arnold comes to Earth to kill a woman that will bear a child that causes a future controlled by machines much grief.  Another being - a man - also comes through time to see if he can save the woman.  The story really is the strength of this film. Cameron does a quality job with the direction giving us more than enough special effects, car collisions, shootings, and a tireless parade of swan songs for the Robot, yet the script is able to promote a sense of humanity through all this with its interesting plot and characterizations.  Linda Hamilton does a fine job as a beautiful woman just trying to make a living who is all of a sudden sucked into a 21st century plot that desires her death and will stop at no means to acquire it.  Michael Biehn is good too, as is the rest of the cast.  I really enjoyed the by-play between Paul Winfield and Lance Henrickson as policemen.  Arnold is Arnold.  He is the Terminator.  It is one of his better performances, because he has such little dialogue and has an odd ability to look menacing and void of any great thought."

","i saw this when i was about 9 years old. It was the film which you tell your friends you've seen, so they would think you were cool.<br/><br/>Complex plotting and some stellar action sequences make this a classic of the sci-fi genre. And no matter how cheap the effect look today, it still carries the same effect it did all those years ago. Although these days, seeing a character gun down cops by the dozen, isn't as shocking as i'm sure it would've been when this movie came out to the public. It shocks in more ways too, probably seen as a very daring film in it's day.<br/><br/>Arnie does his best when he doesn't have to speak so much. Very cool in his black leather jacket, riding his motorcycle, he is as menacing as they come. Linda hamilton plays the helpless victim well and michael biehn fits the role of the hero comfortably. Dialogue may not be great, but the story is intact and tight enough to get the tension buzzing. Which it does superbly. Great film, strangely becomes cooler with age."

","This is the movie that started Schwarzenegger's career, and, as we all know, his acting has only slightly bettered since. But that's not the problem. Schwarzenegger is at his best as the reckless, unmotivated robot trying to hunt down and kill Sarah Connor. And the more inhuman he seems to be, the more human the whole story gets. Behind all the action, explosions and the furious (although cheap slow-motion) end, there is a deeper message: even if you feel small and unimportant, you can be of some paramount importance in the future. The most intense scene are not those when the Terminator kills the dancers in the disco or runs amuck in the police station. It's the loving scene in the middle of the movie, when John Connor is conceived. This scene is intense, and is interrupted by the nearing Terminator that abruptly disturbs the whole scene. A great combination. Terminator is thus a typical movie of the 80's with a lot of shootings, but, beneath it, a great story, and a message that makes the movie my all-time favorite."

This is the visualized reason, out of a thousand others, of why we shouldn't agree a nuclear war.<br/><br/>The movie marked James Cameron's second directed movie, after the loosy PIRANHA 2, that became his real ticket to Hollywood.<br/><br/>The casting is an amazing crew of, at that time, newcomers. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (The Terminator) is the perfect kind of an inhuman but human-looking robot. His muscular features and his ""robotic"" Austrian accent makes him 100% believable as the ruthless Cyborg who's only mission is to kill a young woman, Sarah Connor. LINDA HAMILTON (Sarah Connor) is the one who we have sympathy for because she doesn't know that she is going to carry on the child that will grow up to the man who will lead the command to the counterstrike the Cyborgs, JOHN CONNOR. The Cyborgs has put a high price on that man if he gets killed. And if there weren't time to kill him during the war, send someone to kill the woman who gave birth to their worst enemy who will otherwise save the world from the Judgement Day. She makes the role really good and is a truly everyday working girl. Worth seeing. MICHAEL BIEHN (Kyle Reese) who plays the man, who's sent to protect Connor, is damn good who tries to tell the truth for her and win her faith before The Terminator has finished his mission. When you listen to him, he really is from the future and you can also feel sympathy for him and feel the pain he suffered from the war.<br/><br/>All necessary characters are involved in this action-movie. One Hero, One Woman, One Enemy; who are all acted out really well.<br/><br/>Great direction, both technically and physically. The Cinematography endarkens the whole picture to a scary environment. The special Terminator effects are stunning. ""The Terminator Theme"" by Brad Fiedel is memorable but there I will put one minus due to the loosy techno inspired tones he has been using in scoring the movie.<br/><br/>The picture says more than a hymn. And a bad hymn gives a misapprehended picture. I will say that if it weren't for the music/technotrance, I had given this movie a 9/10 instead of 7,5/10.<br/><br/>However, If you want to see the most original motion picture ever.

","Well, my generation at least. Terminator is referenced in so many films it becomes impossible to list, it can be held responsible for a deluge of 'robot from the future' films, and yet its memory remains untarnished. Why? Because this is where it all began (yes I know there were similar films before Terminator, but how many can *you* name? And how many were this influential?) As well as launching the careers of most of the actors, it catapulted James Cameron into the limelight. The plot, which seems so simple (robot from the future comes to kill someone) is incredibly complex, depending on how far you wish to analyze it. There is so much material in the Terminator world that even the sequel barely scratched the surface, and although it is only hinted at in this, the background history (future?) gives the story unparalleled depth. I can't think of another film that has ever had me thinking about the possibilities for so long (and then you start thinking about temporal paradoxes and go insane...) or that has captivated me so completely. The Terminator is the only film that I could even think of describing as flawless, and it still remains my fervent wish to see it on the big screen (sadly I was 4 when it was released) So in case I'm being too subtle for you, I absolutely love this film."

","Although I loved TITANIC as much as anyone,  THE TERMINATOR is my favorite James Cameron movie.  It was raw,  gritty,  violent and although it has its own technological wonders,  they are far fewer than the ones in Cameron's newer movies,  and I liked the lack of frills.  This story about a woman running for her life from a futuristic cyborg programmed to assassinate her is more human than technological.  I hope that Cameron never loses that quality because I've always admired it and noticed it in every one of his films from THE TERMINATOR to ALIENS to THE ABYSS to T2 to TITANIC.  There's lots of special effects,  but he never fails to breathe life into his human characters.  I am like a lot of people,  I really like Michael Biehn and every movie I've ever seen with him in it.  He never gets the kind of attention he deserves,  and this early role of Kyle Reese,  the human soldier who risked ultimately everything to travel over time to help protect Sarah Connor,  was the first nuanced hint of his amazing talent and is still my favorite role of his.  And I'm certainly glad I'm not strange for thinking that the brief love affair that the two had was a touching and fitting though very surprising ingredient to the story.  To me, the talk that they have about the bleakness and pain that Reese knows is in the future and the sudden and unexpected discovery of their love is making a subtle,  yet profound statement,  like saying hope in the stead of hopelessness,  life in the place of lifelessness,  and joy and love in the place of hate and violence and pain. Okay,  I'm corny,  but this movie really did leave me with the corniness you read.  And last but not least,  Arnold Schwarzenegger as the huge,  ammoral killer,  a real treat,  the icing on the cake,  and my favorite lines: ""Twelve guage auto loadah...Phase plasma rifle with a forty watt range...uzi nine millimetah!!!""  : )"

","Re-viewing The Terminator, I'm struck by how much tighter and more emotionally involving this film is to its successor, Terminator 2.<br/><br/>T2 feels bloated and too much in love with its technology in comparison with Terminator's passable FX. However, the Biehn/Hamilton romance is powerful.<br/><br/>Additionally, the combat scenes are much more intense than T2's. There was no real danger level in T2 -- even though Robert Patrick's T-1000 character is superior to Schwarzenegger's Terminator.<br/><br/>Also, Arnold's flat unemotional villian is superior to his flat, unemotional hero. Arnold's better as a villian.<br/><br/>The scene in which the Terminator invades the human compound in the future is perhaps the bleakest in cinematic history, complete with off-screen sobbing from a woman, who's crying perhaps embodies the hopelessness of the situation.<br/><br/>Cameron has worked better with smaller budgets -- shortening his film and narrowing his focus. In T2 there were many slow moments; Terminator has none."

","Inspiring countless spin-offs, rip-offs, and parodies, this cold, gritty, tough sci-fi actioneer was the film that launched its stars and director into international stardom and jumpstarted Arnold Schwarzenegger's career.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple, but at the same time, mind-boggling. It's about a great war in the future: machines vs. humans. After years of combat, the humans eventually win under the leadership of Captain John Conner, and as a final counterattack, the machines blast a cyborg back through time to destroy the mother of Conner before he was born, thus preventing the humans' victory. But Conner finds out about the plan, and he sends back a military man of his own. So it's pretty much a battle of cat-and-mouse around the city of New York, as the military man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tries to protect Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) from his ruthless, unstoppable cyborg counterpart (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Jammed with breathtaking action scenes and believable performances, this movie became an instant classic, and director James Cameron, who would later win an Oscar for directing ""Titanic,"" got instant recognition.<br/><br/>The dark colors alone in the movie make it memorable....(Can anyone recall more than about a minute of daytime in this film?) providing atmosphere that works. Awesome Arnie is also effecient as the Terminator, the ruthless cyborg, as he stalks Sarah and kills anyone who he has to in pursuit of her. But really, this is Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn's movie, as their characters are forced to survive together and Sarah must come to grips with the fact that she's the mother of the world's savior. Romance blossoms, of course, and all in all, I think it's the human story behind those two that really makes the film effective. Therefore, Arnold's really a backdrop for a bigger picture. His story really shows up in the sequel, which is also a great film.<br/><br/>See ""The Terminator"" if you have not yet. It's not for the squeamish, featuring drilling action scenes that drag on for a long time, but it's certainly worth as much money as you can spare to rent it!<br/><br/>***** out of *****"

","Why is it, that when people think about The Terminaor, they automatically think of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Well I for one, do not see this as Arnold's movie.  I see it as Michael Biehn's.  Now don't get me wrong, I think that Arnold did one hell of a job as the terminator, but i know that Biehn's Kyle Reese, gets far less credit than he's supposed to.  <br/><br/>This movie wasn't based on action, but rather plot, and acting.  Michael Biehn gives a greater performance as Kyle Reese, than any of the actors did with their parts.  We can see his tough character of the future trying to make it in the relatively calm world of the present.  Kyle also gives the best lines in any of the terminator movies.  We can forget one-liners and concentrate on Biehn's powerful speeches.  Stuff like, ""That terminator is out there.  It can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.  It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear.  And it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.""  And, ""Nobody get home.  Nobody else comes through.  It's just him...and me.""<br/><br/>I especially like, ""Why didn't you bring any weapons.  Something more advanced.  Don't you have any ray guns?"" ""You go naked.  Something about the field being generated by living tissue. Nothing dead will go."" ""Why?"" ""I didn't build the ________ thing!!!""<br/><br/>I can't explain it, but for some reason, Michael Biehn is my favourite actor.  He's played the best roles.  Like Kyle Reese, Corporal Hicks in Aliens, Hirram Coffey in The Abyss, Johnny Ringo in Tombstone, and major roles in Navy seals, and The Rock.  He's by far the best ""soldier"" style actor in Hollywood, and has one of the best portfolios in the business. Remember his name, for it's not as big as it should be.  Michael Biehn."

Pop had to go back in time for his son-who ordered him to go(interesting family chain of command)TO EVEN EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE! I wonder if this should lead to a prequel. Was Sarah already in an alternate time line, already touched by time travel? No doubt, it's probably hard to do a movie or story about time travel without some internal consistency problems. For example, in movies like Back to The Future II, where Marty & Jennifer see their future selves. Seems theoretically they should have discovered that their future selves disappeared the day they went into time warp, casualties of their own time travels!  All that said, use of time travel stories as metaphors of observing & experiencing variables in the impact different choices can have on our destiny can more than make up for not being scientifically correct. Especially since no body's sure if time travel itself is even possible- much less scientifically correct.

"matthew-58","Null","0","0","28 February 2002"," Frightening thriller that defines a genre for a new era.
","I don't care much for Schwarzenegger and actors of his kind.  His attempts at light comedy, for example, have been little short of embarrassing.  This genre is his forte.  His lines are thankfully kept to a minimum and even I have to admit that the sight of the Austrian with his gun and shades is one of the most striking images of modern cinema.<br/><br/>We gather right from the start that Schwarzenegger, newly arrived in LA from thin air, is a dangerous proposition when he rips the heart from a punk who dares to challenge him.  However, elsewhere in the same city, another figure arrives in exactly the same way and proceeds to steal the clothes from a tramp and then gets chased by the police.  If the first man is the Terminator, who is the second?  And what will follow?<br/><br/>What does follow is one of the most exhilarating rides a cinema audience could ever wish to be taken on.  A pleasantly attractive girl's very ordinary life is turned upside down.  Schwarzenegger is right for the role of emotionless killer and Linda Hamilton is brilliant.  A criticism that might be levelled at the film is that it is slightly sexist, but it could have been worse.  Cameron could easily have fallen into the trap of casting a Bruce Willis type to play her guardian, but instead went for the little known Biehn, who hardly fits the tough guy image and in fact portrays a very human and bruised hero, armed with a police rifle only, who clearly contrasts with the enormous Terminator.  A great dramatic device. <br/><br/>
The Terminator is not the first screen cyborg but he overshadows his predecessors.  His superhuman strength, mechanical advance against everything and complete lack of restraint is horrifying.  He is just a programmed computer with a clear motive and does not kill everybody he encounters.  There are many times in the film when he ignores people, brushes them aside or causes them damage but lets them live.  Kyle and Sarah have to cope with the fact that he can turn up at any time.  Perhaps the most frightening scene in a very scary movie is when they are in police custody, with Kyle in isolation because he is believed to be schizophrenic, and the Terminator turns up, systematically kills every cop in the station and it is simply a case, for the second time, of who will get to Sarah first.<br/><br/>The film does have a plot, which is simple and effective for a thriller, but also has a human message which it does not let you forget.  The film has one of the most meaningful sex scenes in a film (how often do you see a sex scene in a film that actually, shock horror, turns out to be the conception of a child, and one that is wanted) and a great twist is that we find Kyle is the father of the man who will become such a threat to the Terminator and the machines that are set to take over the world.<br/><br/>A scary movie with hardly any cheap shock moments, a fantastic theme tune and soundtrack and a story less about a murderer and more about a couple of good people.  A film that must really frighten Americans, who seem to think (and this movie confirms it) that bullets are the answer to problems.  Well, not this one.  The Terminator is not a boo-hiss pantomime villain, just a machine that has a task.  He doesn't dwell on anything and when he kills does it quickly and efficiently.  Just what will stop this creature?  There is a little comic relief, provided mostly by Winfield, Henriksen and Boen, but it isn't the annoying comedy its sequel often is.<br/><br/>Viewing the film is certainly a disturbing experience, but it is difficult to tear away from.  A film which must be seen by fans of the thriller or sci-fi genres."

The faceless, huge, unceasing, single-minded, ever-closing thing that used to chase me round my dreams is here on the big screen and he's Arnie.  That is all this film is. A classic nightmare, the Jungian ogre archetype made celluloid.<br/><br/>James Cameron has distilled this primal fear perfectly for the screen, the pacing is exquisite.  Even as the credits roll you still expect the Terminator to somehow resurrect itself once more and continue its relentless pursuit.  It has everything that a good horror flick should have, anticipation, genuine fear and timing.  The special effects don't have to be good when you've got film-making as good as this.<br/><br/>This film can be seen as the apprentice piece of James Cameron, the first to spotlight his dark and dystopian future visions best summed up in the name of the nightclub in The Terminator; 'Tech Noir'.  This territory is revisited in Aliens, Strange Days, and latterly, Dark Angel. This universe has been inhabited by Ridley Scott among others and perhaps owes something to the Cold War and the nagging fear of nuclear conflict that ran through the 70's and 80's.<br/><br/>This film is renowned as being very violent.

In the not-to-distant future, a war is being fought between humans and killer machines.  The machines are on the verge of losing the war.  So they desperately send a killer cyborg called a T-800 or a Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to 1984 to kill a woman named Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) who is destined to give birth to the leader of the human resistance, John Connor.  The humans however, send a brave soldier back in time to intercept the Terminator.  His name is Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn).  Now only one question is left.  Who will reach Sarah first: Reese or the Terminator?<br/><br/>This has to be one of the greatest sci-fi films to come out during the 1980's.  It is also director James Cameron's second best film behind Aliens.<br/><br/>This movie has so many good action scenes, my favorite being the police massacre scene because it shows just how cold and relentless the Terminator is in pursuit of something it wants.<br/><br/>This is definitely Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role yet.  He has yet been able to top it off.  His performance in T2 was alright but it wasn't typical Schwarzenegger.  Michael Biehn probably gives his best performance here also.  His role in Aliens was pretty awesome, too.  He did take a turn in The Abyss by playing a bad guy.  Linda Hamilton, an extremely underused actress plays probably her most convincing role of her career.  Her performance in T2 was great, but it's sad that she won't be appearing in the T3.<br/><br/>One final note about the Special Edition DVD.  The many special features it has like the ""Terminated"" scenes and stuff is cool, but the sound quality of the remastered version is poor.  The reason why I probably hate the remastered version so much is probably because I'm used to watching an old unmastered version of the movie that my dad taped off of Cinemax or HBO or something like that.<br/><br/>The Terminator gets a 10/10."

","""Nice night for a walk""<br/><br/>I was an action junkie as a kid, and at my thirteenth birthday party, after already watching this movie once, my friends and I watched the entire thing again in slow motion to take it all in. We replayed the police station scene, where a guy carrying a cup of coffee is torn up by a machine gun, about ten times. It is Arnold's best film, mainly because he only has about six lines or so. I've seen this countless times, but I can't seem to get bored with it. I like this one much better than the sequel, which was too preachy. Terminator is pure action with plenty of gore, unforgettable lines, and fast paced energy."

","This is truly a great film, which of course is always somehow compared with part two, just as part two is always compared to this one. Sure this one has it's advantages over the second one, but it also is a bit worse at times. But those times are not as frequent or as important as the many times it has advantages over the second installment, because everything that is worse in this film, over the second one has to do with special effects. Now listen closely, the effects are not bad, they are as good as they were in 1984, but they just are not as good as the effects in 1991 and that is it. Regarding the rest of the film, it sure as hell is somewhat better than the sequel. First of all, everything in this film is more original and fresh (because it is a first of course), but not only that. One thing I like a bit more in this film, is that it is darker you know, more mechanic and inhuman. You really get a sense here of the fact that you are dealing with an emotionless machine. All this dark sphere that is created must be ascribed mainly to James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. James Cameron, of course for his vision and execution of the way he felt the music and the sets had to be and Schwarzenegger for his good performance. I know that many people may well argue about my last statement: 'Good performance, Schwarzenegger can't play CRAP!' Well in terms of great character roles or dramatic ones this might all be very true, but in this film Schwarzenegger captured everything his character was about perfectly. You might say he didn't have to act at all. But you go ahead, try to pass as a machine in a movie, kill emotionless, walk static, look grim, speak slowly and well 'machinery' (cut off). All of this enables the viewer to totally believe that he is indeed a machine.<br/><br/>
The other actors here are not to be forgotten either, Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor are also very well characterized by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton respectively. I mean they very believable and they have a good chemistry in the film. They are also the characters seen in the best parts of the film (not the coolest, that's what Schwarzenegger is for). My favorite scenes in this movie certainly are the 'intimate scene' and the 1st 2029 A.D. scene with the epilogue at the beginning. All in all I must say that this is a masterpiece of cinema and a must see for everyone who love movies.<br/><br/>

","There is only one way of describing this film, classic and anyone who has seen it wil probably say the same.  The second, however is rubbish, what with sarah being a hardened psychopathic danger to society!  Well I am here to talk about the first.  Firstly, the Terminator to me is the scariest character I have ever encountered.  Forget the trashy Michael Myers and the pathetic ""Scream"" mask,  sheer horror for me comes from the conscience-less face from Schwarzenegger, it was such a shame that he was a good guy in the second because Patrick is a wannabe. The effects were very cheap as we much forget that the first was very budgeted.  People are annoyed that there is no CG like the second, but we must remember that that technology was only begun when the second was released 6 years later.****spoiler***  Here is one of my favourite parts of the movie: (Arnold is in the police station) Arnold:""I'm a friend of Sarah Conner, I was told she would be here, could I see her please?"" Officer:""Yeah, she's still bein' questioned by the police, it could be a while,you should take a seat."" (Arnold scan measurements of the room and then leans toward the officer) Arnold: I'll be back!<br/><br/>At that Arnold leaves, comes back crashing through the door and destroys the room and kills 17 cops while looking for Sarah. A classic scene and where Arnold first said those famous words.  So altogether, The Terminator is the best film I have ever seen."

The thing that I prefer about this one instead of T2 is that the chances were more on the evil side in this one.

","OK, it's a classic, but few would argue that it's aged well. The effects, particularly at the climax, now leave a lot to be desired, (and in hindsight, so does the acting).<br/><br/>Still, it's the interesting (if far-fetched) plot that drives the film, and the fact that the Terminator itself is one of the greatest screen baddies ever. For the few who have never seen the film, it won't be giving the game away to say that the titular bad guy takes some finishing off, coming back from the dead time and time again in an inventive showdown in a factory. That's because this is one of those films that has inspired countless clones and homages. The inferior sequel, suffering from a crippling lack of imagination, doesn't even come close to capturing the menace of an unstoppable killing machine, even though Robert Patrick gave the T-1000 a look and feel all its own.<br/><br/>The prospect of a third film is quite depressing. I'd prefer to see a remake of this, or a Star-Wars style update with updated fx."
"Sonatine97","9","0","0","4 July 2001"," T1 Far Better Than T2
","For me T1 outstrips T2 in many departments, primarily because any sequel that rides off the back of a very successful original will have a bigger budget, more technicians, more scriptwriters, bigger & better sfx etc etc.<br/><br/>So it came as no surprise to see that T2 had all these features but at the end of the day it was nothing more than a retread of T1, and as a consequence doesn't fall into the same classic status as its parent.<br/><br/>When I first saw T1 back in 1985 I'd hardly heard of Arnie apart from his Conan films. But as the film rolled I immediately began to warm to him as the cold calculating cyborg on a mission to kill his nemesis (sarah Connor) from the past who's future son will change the outcome of a war between humans & cyborgs, something that Arnie, as a T800 cyborg has been returned to the past to prevent.<br/><br/>As one would except from a Cameron/Hurd film the action comes thick and fast, but the story & the characterisation isn't forgotten in all the mayhem.<br/><br/>The lead protaganists, Connor (Hamilton), Reese (Biehn) and of course Arnie, do a very good job with their characters. Ok, so Arnie doesn't get round to saying too much, probably because of his Austrian accent being a little too thick for American audiences to take on board. However, his accent is perfect for the T800,adapting to the world of 1984.<br/><br/>There are many great moments in the film and of course there are one two classic quotes that will go down in cinema history, such as ""I'll Be Back!!"" and ""F**k You, ***hole!"". you just have to watch the movie to understand how those quotes fit perfectly into the story!<br/><br/>It was interesting that Arnie very much wanting to play the badguy in T800. Perhaps he felt at the time that this would be his big chance to get into the Hollywood limelight - and boy did it pay off in spades.<br/><br/>T1 is good on video but is even better on DVD. You can still see the small budget in this film and there are a lot of sfx that look quite basic, as well as positively visible. However, that was all to change when T2 came along and a new generation of cgi & morphing made audiences' jaws drop in amazement.<br/><br/>But for the gee-whizz sfx of T2 I would recommend T1 first and foremost. Its a great film and has a cult following too. We will have to see what T3 has to offer next year, but T1 will still be way ahead of the crowd.<br/><br/>****/*****"

"Kyle Reese","10","0","0","12 May 2001"," My favourite movie of all time
","The Terminator is my favourite movie of all time, it has everything I look for in a film, action, love, an excellent music score, an excellent cast, including my favourite actor Michael Biehn. I love everything about this film, in it's day, nothing had ever been seen like it, and is still highly entertaining today. When thinking about the films relatively modest budget, what was achieved was amazing. Although the model of Schwarzenegger is not as impressive as the one used in the sequel, it can be tolerated and is an extremely small flaw in a fantastic film. The car chases, gun-battles and explosions are nicely interluded by an intriguing plot and a love story. The Terminator is so much more than just an action films, it explores many issues and successfully brings them all to our screens.<br/><br/>      The best character is Kyle Reese, portrayed by Michael Biehn, in the role that launched his career. Reese is the best hero character of any, and Biehn is highly entertaining in every scene he appears in. It is isn't every day that a viewer will have a film character to be his idol, but Reese is simply cool and the kind of guy every teenager wishes they could grow up to be. The humor in the film comes from the police characters of Traxler and Vukovich, portrayed admirably by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen. They are a perfect combination in the film and every scene they appear in is enjoyable. They're deleted scenes on the new DVD are a must. Henriksen was a Cameron regular, appearing in Piranha II, and later in ALIENS, along with Michael Biehn as well. The brilliant Bill Paxton also makes a cameo here and he would go on to be Cameron's most used actor to date. The Terminator has it all and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made."

"olly_mann","Null","0","0","29 April 2001"," An action movie classic
","Back in the days when 'Titanic' was just a big old boat and the script for 'Junior' had not yet been accidentally dropped in the greenlight pile, James Cameron was the up-and-coming director of low-budget action movie 'Piranha II: Flying Killers' and Arnold Schwarzenegger was a towering Teutonic wunderkind that you wouldn't want to mess with. Together they made 'The Terminator', and transformed a genre forever.<br/><br/>The concept is fantastically simple: an unstoppable killing machine (Schwarzenegger) goes back in time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), future mother of John Connor, leader of the resistance. The direction is intelligent, humorous, and stylistic; Cameron gradually builds up the tension with a series of stacked set pieces that result in a fast-paced finale that effortlessly blends the intensity of face-to-face combat with the spectacle of bullet-ridden cops flying across the screen.<br/><br/>
Oh yes, it's all very easy to laugh at the eighties perms, disco boogying and dated special effects. It's even easier to pick holes in the script: why, for example, when Sarah proves so difficult to kill, doesn't the Terminator go back in time another thirty years and kill her mother? And why, if he can expertly mimic anyone, does he choose to speak like a cack-brained Austrian?<br/><br/>Such distractions, however, do not override the fact that lying under this classic audience-pleaser is a dark, serious, emotive movie, with a convincing performance from Michael Biehn as Reese, and a genuinely disturbing man v machine subtext that still resonates today. <br/><br/>
It's about time the commonly held misconception that Arnie's sixteen lines somehow form the basis of the movie is exposed as falsehood. Yet an attempt to find any other performer who could request a `phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range' with quite the same level of automated cool would be an uphill struggle indeed. `I'll be back', he famously declares in his trademark shades. And thank Christ for that."

","I was fortunate enough to see a new digital print of this film with a new Dolby soundtrack. The new sound rocks and is a major improvement over the Mono from before.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Cameron as a director though. There are no huge comparisons between the terrifying Dark Future LA and the 1984 LA. As most scenes are shot at night in derelict parts of town the whole films looks miserable. It can also be so VERY, VERY 80's. Take a gander at the clothing and the music. The Technoir scene is a great example. <br/><br/>Arnie is super-cool as the emotionless cyborg who just blows everyone away WITHOUT grinning at the camera. Michael Beihn makes for a good hero and Linda Hamilton is just as good as Sarah Connor. But she became really annoying in the sequel. It's a shame Lance Henrikson isn't in it for long and Dick Miller has an amusing cameo.<br/><br/>It is quite scary in parts too. The steel exo-skeleton of the Terminator is not the kind of bad guy I'd wanna go up against and the visions of the robot war is rather ugly. Especially when we see the wheel crush up all the human skulls. Although it is quite unlikely that skulls would be piled up like that. Where are the rest of the bones?<br/><br/>The Terminator theme is very cool but the rest of Brad Fiedel's score is absolutely terrible. It's nothing but inaudible noise. The same applies for T2 and his score for True Lies. Has anyone apart from Cameron ever employed him?<br/><br/>Most of today's sci-fi is junk and quickly forgettable (Forgotten, AvP) but this has stood the test of time and will do for a long time to come, regardless of the 80's feel to it. <br/><br/>But Cameron made it in 1.85:1, which sucks a film of this size deserves scope, but I guess he only worked with what he had. The second film, while not an improvement, is up to the same standard. See the new version of this movie if you can it's a great improvement over the older print."

For example, Kyle Reese is the male protagonist, which, like that of a crime and Film Noir detective, is unstable, a loner, has many personal problems and falls for the female protagonist. The Terminator (Arnie) is that of a very complex character much like Roy Batty of Blade Runner, also a new genre (Future Noir.

","This is one of the few examples of a film where Arnold Schwarzenegger pulls of a good performance, as an emotionless cyborg. And that isn't sarcasm I really mean Arnie pulls off an excellent performance. The film is essentially divided into two sections. One is where Arnie's T-800 goes on a LA wide killing spree, which is the best part. The second section on the other hand is packed with Jim Cameronesque preachy symbolism and dull to lifeless performances by supporting characters. The epicentre of this A bomb of underacting is Michael Biehn's dreadful performance as Kyle Reese. Biehn joins Hayden Christiansen and Ahmed Best in my personal collection of terrible performances in a sci-fi film. He seems to have an emotionless quality to his acting that makes half of the film unbearable. Apart from that, the film is brilliant and I thoroughly recommend seeing it."

","There`s not much unsaid about THE TERMINATOR since everyone`s mentioned it being the best genre film of the 80`s though no one seems to have spotted a couple of minor plot holes... 1 ) Reese mention`s he was born after the holocaust , but he`s able to drive a car no problem. Seems the machines of the future will still allow humans driving lessons . That`s kind of them 2 ) Reese has his hands cuffed behind his back. Even if he gets the keys for the handcuffs how is he able to unlock them on his own ?<br/><br/>But apart from that there`s little to criticize. Arnie has never given a better performance , Michael Biehn comes across very well as the all American hero and amazingly never became a major Hollywood star , and James Cameron shows what can be done on a relatively small budget.

"hatsunemiku-27340","5","3","9","11 September 2017"," Does the Future Hold Up?
","Candid admission time: despite selling myself as a fan of action cinema there are two classic genre films I've neglected my whole life. Predator is one, and The Terminator is another. Recently because of this blog I decided to watch both in the hopes of giving a fresh review from a new perspective. Alas, I couldn't finish Predator. I didn't think it was particularly entertaining in the action department, I cared little for the characters, the Predator itself was threatening but not enough for me to be glued. I considered it more a slasher film with buff men in lieu of stupid teens.<br/><br/>The Terminator falls into the same boat in a way. It's a horror film more so than action, a kind of slasher/chase movie where we follow our heroes in their escape from the monster. Unlike Predator which hides the creature from us, The Terminator focuses on the cyborg hit-man and makes sure we know what he looks like and how daunting he can be.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor is a waitress in Los Angeles when her life is shattered by the appearance of two men from the future, one a resistance fighter, another a Terminator, a cybernetic organism. The future is bleak with nuclear holocaust caused by the rise of the machines sending humans underground. With the machines ruling, a resistance fighter named John Connor has become a hero, throwing a monkey wrench into the inorganic creatures plans. Facing defeat thanks to this man, the machines send a Terminator into the past to eliminate Connor's mother and reset the timeline. Somehow one of the resistance managed to go through as well to protect Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>Despite the futuristic ideas and plot the movie itself is very light science fiction and operates more in the horror genre. Sarah Connor is completely unprepared for what she is about to face and Arnie's Terminator is like Friday the 13ths Jason, an unstoppable brute who is seemingly unkillable. It makes for some compelling sequences of destructive action, the Terminator shooting up a police station being a particular highlight.<br/><br/>As this is a site dedicated to action critique, I'd be remiss not to mention the editing making many action sequences quite awkward. The very first series of murders has the Terminator kill a trio of punks. What could have been a quick and effective assault is a jankily edited nightmare that hardly makes sense. As the movie progresses, I found the editing got increasingly better but overall it's another case of overediting ruining the effectiveness of action.<br/><br/>Another reason I wasn't as enthralled by the action as others is my disdain for what I call ""Industrial Action"". These movies are typically dark, ugly affairs that focus on abandoned places and industrial areas for settings. Cannon Films was a constant perpetrator of making films that felt inorganic purely because of the settings. Cobra is a prime example and even a film like Robocop, which I do quite enjoy, comes across as bland and uninteresting because of the setting. All of these films take place in metropolitan areas but nothing feels lived in or real. Even in Terminator, the chase sequences aren't as compelling as they could be purely because of how staged it all seems. I don't care how late at night it is, there would be a lot more cars on the streets than the movie portrays. It pulls me out of the action.<br/><br/>The other facets of The Terminator are just as artificial in my eyes. The plot is interesting as a concept but goes nowhere interesting. I'm sure T2 will expand upon the mythology built up in this first outing, but as a stand alone product The Terminator doesn't invest me in the film's world. The stakes feel nonexistent because Sarah Connor is so removed from the future war against the machines and there isn't enough of a connection thematically. We see the war and its effects, but they aren't tied into the events of 1984 enough.<br/><br/>What ties the past and future together is Kyle, the resistance fighter protecting Sarah. The problem here is that Kyle is a weak character and the romance that buds between himself and Sarah is poorly executed and extremely two-dimensional. Sarah, for her part, has some character development but she doesn't exactly feel well-rounded and isn't interesting either. When the artificial killing machine antagonist is the most compelling character in your film, you're missing the point.<br/><br/>I don't have a lot to say about The Terminator because I didn't feel it provided me with anything to really talk about. And that's the sign, to me, of an average film. I don't think The Terminator is bad but I do think it's two-dimensional and lacking in a lot of departments. I mentioned with Speed that you can turn your brain off and enjoy it. That was a fast paced, dumb action movie though. This is trying to have a little more gravitas and meat on the bones and I really do not think it works."
"lee_eisenberg","7","3","9","13 October 2005"," Both ""Terminator"" movies will always be back.
","Okay, so ""The Terminator"" wasn't any kind of masterpiece. But it did have an interesting premise, that a machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) gets sent back in time to kill the mother of the future resistance leader. Admittedly, it seems a little far-fetched that Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) only has this boy because Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) gets sent back in time to protect her. But it's just a movie, people! True, if Ah-nuld had murdered the mother, then there never would have been a resistance leader to begin with, and the government wouldn't have seen any reason to send him back in time. But you can't dwell on that stuff. Just sit back and watch the action. As it is, I actually liked ""T2"" better, mainly because the mother was a bad-ass in that one."

"jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","10","2","5","14 July 2018"," An 80's Classic
","The Terminator (1984) Review<br/><br/>Starring Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sarah Connor (Hamilton) is a push over waitress who gets through her days like every other normal person. A cyborg disguised as a man is sent through time to kill her. He searches through phone books to locate every Sarah Connor he can find ruthlessly killing all of them. Kyle Reese (Biehn) is sent through time to protect her eventually finding her just in time before the cyborg gets to her. <br/><br/>There is great chemistry between the two leads but Arnold steals the show. He was originally going to be the hero but decided to go out of the box by convincing James Cameron to make him the villain. It was a great move because he is considered one of the best villains of all time. With his thick Austrian accent he plays a perfect robot.<br/><br/>Sci-Fi films of the 80s never really took themselves seriously. They were often cheesy and dumb with lousy special effects but The Terminator was a game changer. It took the genre very seriously and it results in a very grounded film. Full of great dramatic moments and some brilliant performances, it really plays around with different genres. It's a relentless neo-noir, chase thriller filled with breathtaking action sequences and eye popping special effects. <br/><br/>Beneath all of this there's drama, suspense and horror. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scary bastard playing an efficient cold blooded killer who will stop at nothing to complete his mission. There are so many intense action scenes from a nightclub shootout, a car chase through the streets of LA, a police station slaughter and a tense climactic pursuit. All of them are well executed never going on for too long and they never outstay their welcome. <br/><br/>Writer/director James Cameron wrote a superb screenplay with fully fleshed out characters who have great story arcs. Kyle Reese is a seasoned warrior who is put in a fish out of water type scenario. He's a conflicted man who's seen some nasty crap and clearly suffers from PTSD. He's been in some sticky situations before and he's a character we can really root for. Sarah Connor starts out as the damsel in distress who by the end becomes a hardened strong woman prepared for the grim future that awaits. <br/><br/>The music score by Brad Fiedel is tense, emotional, exciting and memorable. The special effects look incredible from the scene where the Terminator is repairing himself to the future war scenes. Everything just looks and sounds great and though a few shots look a little bit dated today they still hold up very well. It's a timeless film that will be enjoyed for decades to come because it's just so different in its approach the genre."
"jonny2time","10","2","5","9 October 2017"," One of the best films ever made.
","This film scared me when I first saw it. It is a borderline horror movie and that is what makes it believable. The setting is dark, moody, depressing - all of the things you need to make an end of the world scenario believable. It is quite gory and violent without being too much. The story of the film is excellent, the acting very good, but the atmosphere is what really makes this film work in my opinion. Films today lack atmosphere, darkness and grit. This is a masterclass of how to create tension in the audience. It really is gripping, scary and has just the right balance of action and dialogue. Take note new film makers, less is definitely more. You cannot beat this movie. It never gets boring. Classic."
"Geeky Randy","7","2","5","27 January 2010"," ""I'll be back."" Wait for him, the sequel is better.
","In an age when computers began to be relied on more and more, not a scarier film could come along. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the title role, a cyborg sent back through time to kill the mother (Hamilton) of a then-unborn resistance leader that would defeat the invading Terminator-race in the future. Michael Biehn plays an unlikely but well-done hero, with Henriksen, Boen and Winfeld as the unexpected comedic relief that lacked in the sequels. The story suffers from a paradox you could drive a big rig through; the special-effects weren't that far ahead of its time; and the soundtrack may have suited the mood for 1984, but it ended up dating poorly. Schwarzenegger fits the role perfectly. Originally, Henriksen was supposed to play the Terminator. The series continues with the far more impressive ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"".<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"
"tburke85","7","2","5","12 June 2009"," Terminator A Good Sci-Fi Film With Some Flaws
","The Terminator is a good sci-fi film with some flaws but it does have a compelling story, plenty of action, character development, suspense, great special effects especially for that time, and solid performances by the whole cast. I did prefer T2 and most recently Terminator Salvation over this one but the original is still a good film. Writer/Director James Cameron the man behind films like Titanic, True Lies, Alien 2, and the upcoming Avatar showed a real talent as a filmmaker with this movie which was his second one back then. Cameron is one of the best writer/directors out there and he continues to prove just that with every one of his movies. The cast are great in their roles bringing to life these imaginary characters Cameron created for the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic in the title role. He may not have many lines and his screen time is cut a little short near the end well sort of Schwarzenegger still proves to be an effective villain. He was born to play The Terminator a ruthless cyborg from the future that will stop at nothing until it's mission is complete. Michael Biehn is equally impressive as time traveler Kyle Reese from the future. He gets just as much screen time if not a little more than Schwarzenegger and Biehn makes the best of his role as the hero in the movie. He brings an intensity to his performance which makes his believable as a time traveler whose mission is to protect Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton. She's also very good in the role of Sarah an ordinary woman who must find the strength within herself to stop the Terminator before he kills her. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles but they're not given much to do and really any screen time to leave an impression. The whole story of the film would take me forever to fully explain so I'm not going to get into it. It's better to just watch the Terminator before knowing too much what the movie is about before any spoilers could ruin the experience. The action is pretty much non-stop making the film move at a steady pace as the main characters are introduced and the chase begins to get to Sarah Connor first. All the crashes, explosions, chases, fights, and narrow escapes are well executed most of them looking very realistic. The special effects are state of the art especially for movies back then considering they didn't have the technology available today. The few flashback sequences with Reese showing a post Judgment Day are just as good. The world is an apocalyptic wasteland overrun by machines bent on annihilating the human race. Despite some flaws with the dialogue occasionally, answered questions, and somewhat rushed love story although it had to happen or else John Connor wouldn't exist, The Terminator is still a solid sci-fi film. It's much better than other ones out there like Ultraviolet, Babylon A.D., or Aeon Flux to name a few no offense. Overall The Terminator is an entertaining sci-fi adventure definitely worth watching with plenty of action, great special effects, thrills, suspense, drama, some humor, a little romance, and terrific performances by the cast."

"JakeBrinkman","3","5","21","26 June 2019"," A great movie that quickly became very dated
","Note: My first time watching this film was in 2019.<br/><br/>Taking off the rose colored glasses, this would be a B-list action flick that would be quickly forgotten if it were released today. It brought a new level of thought into blockbuster action flicks, but there have been successors that use time travel in an action movie much more effectively. Also, the premise was well thought out with few plot holes, but it was always explained in a way that seemed to highlight a lull in the action rather than build tension for the next scene. The acting was very minimal and forgettable, reminiscent of acting in B-list action films today.<br/><br/>Saving the most obvious for last, the effects were very dated. The computer generated effects have aged the worst. The clothes and hairstyles are a close second, but they can be forgiven as accurate for the 80s. However, the future costumes can't be forgiven. Everyone literally wearing burlap sacks with faces covered in dirt is both cliched and unrealistic.<br/><br/>Finally, the music screamed 80s, not only in style, but also with the disconnect between the score and what's happening on the screen. Movie scores have been one of the slowest film aspects to consistently make progress, and this film is a good example of the inconsistency that remained in the 80s. It's just becoming common to see scores written to evoke emotion for the film's specific scenes, but movies like The Terminator still miss the mark by under- or overplaying the emotion in the scene.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it seems like it has all the makings to be an 80s classic, and I can see why it became as popular as it is today. Although I can also see that if it were released today, it would not be nearly as innovative or memorable, and I can certainly see why young Arnold thought this movie wouldn't amount to anything. Perhaps that is why the Terminator reboot series has been performing poorly in the box office."
"secondtake","7","2","6","9 February 2014"," A cultural touchstone and terrific plot that wears itself thin after some time has passed
","The Terminator (1984)<br/><br/>I just saw this first Terminator movie in 2014 for the third time, and I expected something more, and different from it. Naturally, the surprise is gone, and I think the plot idea is maybe the strongest point to the whole movie. The movie is directed with panache, for sureâ€”the effects, the action, the deliberate lack of depth, the epic glossy wow of it all. But it's not a rich movie, it doesn't have depths, it frankly lacks enough to make a second or third viewing worth the trouble. Unless, of course, you are already invested and committed to it for personal reasons.<br/><br/>The first shot, very early in the movie, when the naked Schwarzenegger appears crouched in the urban night, is archetypal and terrific. And then he moves and interacts (still naked, though you don't see that) and the comic element is in place. And here we have the movie, both profound to the point of being moved, and kitschy and puerile, too. It's sort of meant to be a accessible and direct, and that makes it a great first viewing. The plot is certainly loaded with big (huge) twists and mind-bending ideas. And we want so much for right to triumph over evil. <br/><br/>You have to ask eventually about the acting. Maybe we need a stiff automaton in the role of the robotic machine that is known as the ""terminator"" (a cyborg). So the future governor of California is off the hook. But the other main lead, the woman known so well as Sarah Connor, is a so-so actress. No way around the plain approach she has to being a regular girl caught up in the largest story possible. The other time-traveller, a human played by Michael Biehn, is pure nuts and bolts stuff, too. In fact, it's hard to really love any of the performances, except maybe the police chief. <br/><br/>All of this boils down to a movie that scores very high on concept and on the basic effects. This is what drives it to stardom. But leave it at that. Love it for what it is, plain and simple. James Cameron, the lauded and wealthy director in charge, is no genius here, but is very very able. That's a back-handed compliment, for sure. But lovers of Kubrick or Ridley Scott know what I mean.<br/><br/>A re-alignment of the stars for this one. Over time."

At the same time the resistance is able to send back a protector for Sarah, a soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) in an attempt to prevent her termination by the killer cyborg. The streets of Los Angeles become the fighting ground for the very future of humanity as Sarah must survive or all hope for mankind will be lost...<br/><br/>This English American co-production was co-written & directed by James Cameron & has gone on to become widely acknowledged as just about the best sci-fi action film of the 80's & maybe even to this point it hasn't been bettered, it's an iconic film with many moments that have become part of pop culture & the amount of killer robot flicks that have followed is also a testament to it's popularity & influence. The script by Cameron & producer Gale Ann Hurd is a terrific action packed thoughtful & intelligent sci-fi thriller, it has a great pace about it with plenty of car chases, shoot-outs, fights & futuristic battle scenes to satisfy most action junkies & plenty of robots, an extremely well thought out time travel story that makes perfect sense & an underlying message about putting too much faith in machines & computers in an era when the modern PC hadn't even been invented & I guess Cameron just saw the way things were going. There's so much to enjoy here & so little to not not like, from exciting action set-pieces set both in the present & the future, some great special effects that hold up pretty well even today, a really good solid sci-fi story which is well thought out & easy to pick up & understand while still managing to be gripping & a really fast pace which simply doesn't allow the viewer to become bored although there's still enough meaningful character development when needed for you to care for them & what happens to them. An almost perfect film & an absolute classic of the genre or indeed any genre, one of the best films ever made. Period.<br/><br/>Director Cameron has since gone on to become one of the biggest director's in Hollywood with a string of huge films like Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), True Lies (1994) the the most successful film ever made to date Titanic (1997) while The Terminator was his second full length feature film after the OK horror sequel Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981) & he does a great job of making his small budget go far. From the action scenes to the special effects The Terminator is an impressive film even today, OK some of the stop motion terminator effects aren't the best they still at least look alright. The film is very violent with lots of gun-play, there's also some gore as the terminator has to get rid of his damaged eye by inserting a scalpel into it & plucking it out, he also has to slice his arm open to repair some mechanics.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $6,400,000 this didn't have a particularly big budget but the film doesn't suffer as there's still more car chases, shoot-outs, special effects & fights than a lot of much higher budgeted Hollywood stuff from the time. The music is great, the effects are good, it's well made & the production values are high. The acting is very good all round, apparently only paid $75,000 Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role & he gets to say his trademark 'Ill be back' for the first time on screen.<br/><br/>The Terminator is a solid gold 100% classic & it's as simple & straight forward as that. There quite simply isn't anything that I don't like about this film, definitely recommended. Followed by the equally as brilliant Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the not so brilliant but still enjoyable Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2008) while a third sequel Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins (2009) is apparently in production."

","The Terminator had a large role in launching the careers of many of its makers, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron. It has since become a beloved cult classic and the first film in a franchise that's still alive, kicking and doing well.<br/><br/>So just what makes it work? What elevated this C-list dark scifi horror film above all that had come before? Well, having one of the best action stars of the century as your villain definitely helps. Even if this was one of his earliest roles. It was also the second film of James Cameron, one of the most acclaimed directors of his time. So there's a lot of talent behind it.<br/><br/>But even though the film has been shot and directed really well, and even though Arnold is just about perfect for the role of an inhuman killer cyborg mercilessly hunting Sarah Connor, the mother of the future rebellion, I think the main thing that caught people's attention, is the story. The future has been overrun by robots and in a bid to end the human rebellion they send one of their own into the past to hunt down the mother of John Connor, the leader of the humans. That's such an imaginative concept that it instantly hooks you in, and after that it's pure 80s horror style and action.<br/><br/>It also helps that the special effects are really good, especially for mid-80s. Sure you can spot when Arnold isn't really there, for example, but the effects would look pretty good even today and the dark aesthetic helps hide a lot of the crimes.<br/><br/>One of the best movies to come out of the 80s and still one of the best scifi horror films ever made."

","Since 'The Terminator (1984)' is so iconic, it's easy to forget just how downright solid its storytelling really is. I mean, the core concept alone is so 'out there' that it's a miracle it's as house-held as it currently is. It's really clever stuff. Basically, the feature takes the tropes of the 'slasher' genre and tells them through a science-fiction lens, with the classic 'unstoppable killer' literally being an unstoppable killing machine. The eponymous 'Terminator' doesn't think or feel and it has no sense of self-preservation. It exists for one purpose only: to kill the protagonist. All of this is excellently conveyed through performance (I needn't even mention Schwarzenegger), action and dialogue; the film takes its antagonist seriously so so do we. This makes for a tense and engaging experience that's effortlessly propelled by its world-building. This alone would make for a compelling story, but Cameron wasn't content with keeping things that simple. Instead, he decided to create one of the most satisfying time-travel narratives to date. The whole thing feels incredibly insular yet decidedly massive, as the relatively small-stakes central plot is perpetuated only by its context within the large-scale 'future war' and its world-ending consequences. Indeed, the flick is rather bold in its decision not to tie victory directly into 'saving of the world', rather to ensuring that it only gets destroyed so much: the nuclear war is inevitable but, eventually, the human resistance can win if it's allowed to exist in the first place. Having both the small-scale, in-the-moment, horror-driven elements and the near-intangible, sweeping, science-fiction stuff run simultaneously allows for a wonderfully unique and uniquely wonderful experience. Biehn's future-fighter, 'Reese', is a remarkably interesting character. The way he remembers things that haven't happened yet, his infrequent yet effective flashbacks to the post-apocalyptic future and the way he interacts with a version of a historical figure who has yet to do any of the things she's famous for are all intriguing and well-written. Also, the way he is used to convey exposition is particularly good, as it naturally hints at a much wider world than the budget could afford. Carter's 'Conner' initially comes across as a relatively generic 'final girl' but slowly garners more agency, culminating in a showdown that sees her finally accept what she must do to survive and do it with style. Her romance with 'Reese' is rushed, feels forced and, generally, could have been developed further, especially since it's integral to the story. Its introduction also marks a slower portion of the piece. Still, these issues are small when stacked against the flick's many positives. Overall, it's tense, exciting and enjoyable. It's a mash-up of many genres (including 'action', I'll add) that works far better than you might expect. Plus, its story, as iconic as it is, really is fantastic. 8/10"

"anselmdaniel","8","1","2","22 June 2019"," Classic science fiction movie
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>'The Terminator' is a science fiction movie that premiered in 1984. The movie is directed by James Cameron and written by James Cameron, and Gale Anne Hurd. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. The movie is about a cyborg assassin sent back in time to kill a mother before she gives birth to a son that will win the war against the machines.<br/><br/>The Terminator is a solid science fiction action movie. There are many great action scenes across its 107 minutes of running time. The movie uses the action scenes to great effect by tying it in with the plot. The action is not loud and dumb but makes sense for what the movie is trying to convey. None of the action scenes are too over the top as they make sense for a resistance fighter in Kyle Reese played by Michael Biehn to be trying to stop a futuristic cyborg. The movie has the characters utilize commonly available transportation and weapons to battle the cyborg. Likewise, the terminator played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, utilizes everything it can to track down and terminate Sarah Connor. The cyborg has a logical pattern to track down and kill the mother. The plan made sense and it was interesting to watch scenes from the cyborg's point of view.<br/><br/>The performances by the main cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn are excellent. Arnold plays the robotic cyborg incredibly well. There is not much range to be expected but he is able to convey the action scenes well. Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor. She starts as a waitress that must ascend to protecting the future. This arc is a classic one in storytelling and it makes for an interesting shift in the formula by making the entire journey a self-fulfilling prophecy. Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese does an excellent job attempting to protect and save Sarah Connor. As a futuristic resistance fighter, he is portrayed on the screen as a fish out of water when he is in the past.<br/><br/>The action in the movie is great in both the visual and audio effects. There are many practical effects that the movie uses and it adds much to the overall movie. I enjoyed that the movie was produced with a rather grounded use of props and vehicles. Nothing felt out of place in this movie. The action set pieces are incredibly solid.<br/><br/>The movie does have interesting questions that it asks. The movie utilizes time travel as a plot device. In many cases, time travel can ruin the plot. In this movie, the time travel is a centerpiece of this story. The entire reason why the future happens is because of the time traveling cyborg and resistance fighter. The events in the future simply would not have happened if both of these characters did not time travel. The movie likes to ask this question about the time paradox and does not present an answer. It makes the movie stronger as a result as it appeared the world was in a loop.<br/><br/>I highly recommend 'The Terminator.'<br/><br/>Grade: A"

The entire thing for such a low budget movie works out so well I still can't really believe that this was not a bigger hit in the box office. This movie should have made at least 100 million at the box office if I had to be totally honest on how good it was. I think the plot was really good as well and the time travel was decent enough for what it was for and thankfully it wasn't really all that big of a deal actually. It was just there for the sake of explaining how the characters are all in the same town. And I will say that I do like the whole son subplot and the sex scene showing his conception and how a man from the future is his father."

"nmholland","9","1","2","26 February 2016"," A Must-See Film With One of The Most Iconic Characters of All Time
","The Terminator is directed by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the title character. In the future, 2029, to be exact, a nuclear war has passed. Any remaining humans are struggling to survive against the machines, endoskeletons that are near indestructible. The leader of the resistance is named John Connor. When the machines figure this out, they send one of their own (played by Arnie) back in time to 1984 (of course) to find and ""terminate"" John's mother, Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton. John realizes this, and sends his best soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back to '84 to protect his mother form the invincible machine. Kind of a confusing plot.<br/><br/>Now, as most of anybody knows, James Cameron is one of the best directors today. He's done amazing films, such as Aliens (1986), Titanic (1997), and Avatar (2009). However great those movies are, The Terminator franchise is his best idea, much like Spielberg and Jurassic Park (1993). Although Judgement Day may be slightly better, the original is still a great film, with awesome action and break- through special effects, that still hold up.<br/><br/>Being James Cameron, the movie looks great. His shots captivate all of the car chases, shoot outs, and explosions beautifully. The cinematography, done by Adam Greenberg, makes the film look fantastic. The acting is also truly amazing. This film was Arnie's first big role, followed closely by Commando (1985). He definitely deserves the great reputation he has today, thanks to this considerable role. Linda Hamilton also does very good, and portrays the character arc from a helpless girl to a very powerful woman that doesn't need a man next to her 24/7, unlike nowadays female characters in cinema. Alongside Hamilton, Michael Biehn also does substantial, despite the difficulty of his role.<br/><br/>The next thing I have to mention is the dialogue. The dialogue in this film is so good. There's tons of memorable quotes extracted from this movie, including ""come with me if you want to live,"" and ""I'll be back."" The lines between Sarah and Kyle is great. Their friendship is somewhat rushed, yet it doesn't feel as though it is. It feels as if we missed a point in which they got to know each other better.<br/><br/>Although it may sound as though this film is flawless, but it's not. However, it was very hard to recognize said flaws within the movie. But, I did find one. And a quite big one. It's going to be a bit difficult to explain this issue without giving away a major plot point, but it's possible. Now, having to deal with a subject as time travel, any movie is going to have an unexplained or impossible paradox. This one has to do with the existence of John Connor, prior to the events in this film. That's all I'm going to say. However small this drawback may seem, it prevents the movie from being perfect.<br/><br/>Overall, The Terminator is an astounding film, and anybody and everybody should see it sometime in their life. Just don't watch any of the sequels, besides Judgement Day. I'm going to give The Terminator an A, or a 9 out of 10."
"Clockwork_Orange55","9","1","2","11 October 2015"," """"The Terminator"" is James Cameron's earliest masterpiece.""
","The whole story of the 'Terminator' franchise never makes any good sense. If I were to judge it in that angle, then ""The Terminator"" would be a failure. But cut that. Never had before that I thought a story is the most vital element of a movie. ""Terminator"" is a ballsy, undividedly original 1980s sci-fi action picture. James Cameron's ingenuity, open doors for his outstanding far stretched imaginations for storytelling. Cameron's gifted mind, brought a story that is so fresh and entertaining, into the cinematic legends.<br/><br/>Into the future. Nuclear holocaust strikes, and an artificial intelligence known as Skynet rises up. It deems humanity as a threat and its goal is to wipe out the whole of humanity. Briefly, there is a war between the survivors of the nuclear catastrophe and the machines. A cyborg assassin a.k.a. Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), is being sent by Skynet to back in time to eliminate the mother of the leader of the resistance force, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). If the plan is successful, the formation of the resistance force will be halted and fate altered. But to avoid it from happening, a soldier, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is being sent to be Sarah's protector. ""Terminator"" is obviously a 'Cat & Mouse' story, where the Terminator will only stop living if Sarah is killed.<br/><br/>""Terminator"" exhilarates with so much energy that all scenes, and all moments, were only being captured for the fullest. There are no hollow spaces in the film, and nothing declines. It is the sharp and skillful editing that set it to be a piece of bold, entertaining action flick. To put it simply, ""Terminator"" is a show for great filmmaking. Its performances are proper – Arnold Schwarzenegger is intimidating as the killing machine cyborg and Linda Hamilton excels as the struggled heroine. The supporting casts are solid too, especially from Paul Winfeld and Earl Boen.<br/><br/>It is funny that a woman who does nothing but waitressing is being targeted for extermination. If the Terminator had not been sent, and Kyle Reese never visits that timeline, John Connor, son of Sarah Connor, would not exist. Sarah Connor is a story of a woman who seems scared, weak and incompetent but eventually turns out to be the opposite of her normal self. And Linda Hamilton played her wonderfully well. If there is a message in the movie, it would be Sarah Connor herself. She gives the idea of a person who goes from zero to the unlikely hero, and who ultimately becomes a vital figure would prevent the future apocalypse.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" is James Cameron's earliest masterpiece. Only after years later, he presented the world with several great movies like ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"" and the sequel of this. And too he gave us the two highest grossing movies of all time just for decades later: ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"". He, in the present day, has cemented himself as one of the greatest filmmakers. His contributions like his extraordinary visions for cinema, and his will to entertain audiences, are rarely matched. His ""Terminator"" might just be the start of that fire.<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) twitter: @Alex_DeSmall"
"Tweekums","9","1","2","23 August 2015"," An '80s sci-fi classic
","In the year 2029 mankind has been virtually wiped out by intelligent machines but humanity is fighting back under the leadership of John Connor. It is too late for the machines to defeat him so they send a cyborg killer, a Terminator, back to 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah Connor, before he is even conceived! John couldn't stop this plan so he sends his closest friend, Kyle Reese, back to protect her. Sarah is just an ordinary young woman who has no idea what is about to happen to her; the first she knows that something strange is happening is when two other women, also named Sarah Connor, are reported brutally murdered. It looks as if she will be next but Kyle rescues her just in time she isn't safe though; the Terminator is virtually indestructible and it has only one mission; to kill her.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe that this film is now thirty years old; apart from the '80s 'big hair' it has hardly dated. The plot is relatively straightforward and little time is wasted on unnecessary twists. Arnold Schwarzenegger understandably dominates as the merciless Terminator; he may be a character of few words but those he does say have become iconic; 'I'll be back' has become his catchphrase thanks to him saying it once in this film. Linda Hamilton does a fine job as the ordinary woman, Sarah Connor, we can believe that despite her obvious vulnerability she has an inner strength. Michael Biehn is also good, playing Kyle, a tough but very human character. Director James Cameron gets the action started early on and it doesn't let up until the end. The action is fairly violent, for the most part it doesn't dwell on injuries but there are still a few shocking moments as innocent people are gunned down. Overall I'd say that this is a great film that stands multiple viewings; I know a lot of people prefer the second instalment in this franchise but for me this is the best."

"mgruebel","8","1","2","30 July 2015"," Splendid low budget entertainment
","Gale Anne Hurd and John Cameron really showed how to deliver a whole lot of movie on a shoestring budget. With a budget so tight that ""bandit"" re-shooting of scenes was necessary while evading the local sheriff, the producer/director team launched Schwarzenegger into his action career in a way that ""Conan"" had not quite been able to do.<br/><br/>It was a stroke of genius that Arnold insisted on playing not the hero but the bad robot, sent back from the future to kill the human heroine who might otherwise have a son who would vanquish the machines one day in the future. As a result, ""The Terminator"" had to be changed from a crowd-blender concept to the Arnold-size concept that ""will be back"" with big mayhem and does not try to hide or blend.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton did an incredible job of morphing from pink-dressed diner waitress to steely woman of action whose progeny must save the world of the future. Schwarzenegger developed great affects, like the scanning eyes, to make his character seem less human. And Biehn was a good hero, although he was in the shadow of his monosyllabic adversary. <br/><br/>Some of the special effects have not aged well. Unlike Carpenter in ""The Thing,"" Cameron could not afford to eliminate stop-motion sequences from the film entirely. There just was not a budget for large scale puppetry, the only alternative at the time. Many fans would stone me for saying this, but The Terminator is a good candidate for CGI-ing Stan Winston's vision, if it's done right: following the original shots exactly, without fooling around, while making all motions smooth, and rubbery prostheses more realistic. The cigarette smoke that was blown through the crushed exoskeleton in the closing scenes does not need to be redone!<br/><br/>The plot occasionally wanders a bit, and Cameron is not quite as good a composer as he might think he is, but this film is a true auteur work at the highest level, hampered to an ""8"" only by the tiny budget. Hurd and Cameron were a match made in heaven (and for a while, on Earth). Action film fans should be grateful to this duo for all eternity."
"rooee","8","1","2","24 June 2015"," Terminator: Genesis
","Every bit as relentless and single-minded as the latest Mad Max instalment – and possessing a similar number of car chases – The Terminator was the 1984 calling card of both James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sure, the latter had a couple of lousy Conan films under his belt, but here was a role that would make him a star and give cinema an antihero every bit as iconic as Hannibal or Joker.<br/><br/>The story is fantastically simple. In the future, machines take over, exterminating humanity from the post-nuclear wasteland. The human resistance is led by a man named John Connor. The machines send a ""Terminator"" unit (Arnie himself) back through time to kill John's mother, Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Meanwhile, the humans send a protector, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). The chase begins.<br/><br/>Imagine knowing nothing about this world. Imagine the shock of seeing Arnie laid low with a shotgun, only to rise time and time again. For the first third of the movie, beyond a title card, precious little is explained. All we're seeing is a woman stalked by two moody men. The idea for The Terminator was apparently born of a fever-dream, and with its flashback-forward structure and descending darkness it is drenched in sweaty helplessness.<br/><br/>It's also a masterclass in efficiency and visual storytelling. When it comes to filling in the backstory (here, a future-story), Cameron expertly brings convincing emotional weight to his exposition scenes. Reese is the emotive counterpoint to the dead-cold 101: his mission is driven by love. Not some cheesy, possessive love; Reece carries with him the hope of humanity. He loves John Connor (whom, intriguingly, we never see), so how can he not hold a near-biblical reverence for the mythic mother? Before Judgment Day gave us the powerful and handsome activist, the 1984 origin shows us the gentle, pretty Sarah. (Emilia Clarke has her eyes.) Yet her ascent to soldier is entirely believable given the unbelievable events swirling around her. Sarah is no damsel in distress; she's a warrior waiting for the right distress to unleash her potential.<br/><br/>The poodle-perms and mecha-synth music will either be seen as dating the film, or delivering pleasing period delights, depending on your viewpoint. But what will never date is the film's brutal purity. As we gaze at the poster for Genisys, with Arnie and Sarah pressed together in unity, let's not forget how scary and thrilling it was to see her terrorised... and then turn around and terminate his metal ass."
"bowmanblue","10","1","2","8 August 2014"," Often imitated, never bettered (apart from T2 perhaps)
","The term 'pulp sci-fi' might have well been invented for The Terminator. Originally, it was a little-known sci-fi action film with equally little-known stars. However, it just happened to strike a chord with audiences and catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger to super-stardom and writer/director James Cameron to become one of the most powerful men behind the camera in Hollywood.<br/><br/>It's easy to say that The Terminator would be best enjoyed by men and those who are well into their science fiction. However, perhaps one of The Terminator's major plus points, is that it seems to appeal to almost everyone who likes a decent film. Maybe it's to do with it having a well-acted leading lady who the female audience can identify with, but there are few people out there who haven't seen this film.<br/><br/>In case you don't know... an indestructible cyborg is sent back through time from a world where machines have all but wiped out humanity. His mission is to kill the mother of the only man who will oppose the machines' rule in the future, Sarah Connor. Now, ordinarily, she probably wouldn't stand a chance against such a killer, but, luckily for her (and humanity) the humans of the future have sent back their best soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect her. And so ensure a cat and mouse game of chase where the two humans are constantly on the run from the relentless killer robot.<br/><br/>Like I say... it would be easy to just say watch this if you like dark sci-fi/action. However, if you like film and generally good films, this one's only just over an hour and a half and you only have to read the other reviews to see that I'm not the only one who regards it as a classic.<br/><br/>It's possibly the perfect action movie for adults and - amazingly - it possesses one other (almost) unique trait in the film industry - it has a sequel which (most people believe) surpasses it. If you like The Terminator (and most do) then you should check out its sequel, imaginatively titled Terminator 2. Bother are classics.

"filmfan1991","Null","1","2","13 April 2014"," One of the most iconic and greatest science fiction movies of the 80s
","Often touted as one of the most influential and greatest science fiction movies of all time, ""The Terminator"" still holds up very well after 30 years, 3 sequels (one of which is one of the greatest action movies of all time and one of my favorites), a TV show and much more.<br/><br/>The story is classic science fiction involving a robotic assassin sent back through time to kill the mother (Sarah Connor) of the future human resistance before he's conceived. Following the terminator is a member of the resistance sent to protect Sarah and ensure her survival. Its the classic story of the battle between good and evil but its much more than that. Its also a coming of age story of direction-less young woman and how she gains the courage and resolve to face the unknown future. Also the film serves as a metaphor of what happens when our own creations turn against us namely the machines. Of course stories like this are cliché at this point but ""The Terminator"" handles it very tastefully which helps keep it fresh.<br/><br/>The performances are nothing short of remarkable, especially the iconic performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the relentless, unstoppable killing machine which jump started his career as an action movie star. The guy was perfect for the role with his build and robotic tone of voice; even his iconic line ""I'll be back"". Linda Hamilton in an early role gives a believable performance as the direction-less Sarah who's character goes through a great arc. Michael Biehn is also great as Kyle Reese, the man sent back to protect Sarah.<br/><br/>The special effects in this film show their age but considering the nearly 7 million dollar budget and the fact that CG wasn't even around yet, I'm willing to let that pass. Besides, there's some really great camera-work and editing in this film. For instance, when Sarah is at a night club at one point in the movie both the Terminator and Kyle are there looking for her and when the terminator sees her, the action slows down in motion and the music in the club is replaced by the threatening terminator sound which intensifies the scene. And the soundtrack which is 80s synthesized music also dates the movie but the original ""Terminator"" theme is still iconic because when you listen closely it sounds like a metallic heartbeat but I digress.<br/><br/>Because of the success of this film, James Cameron went on the map as a filmmaker and went on to make other great films including his own sequel that surpassed the original in so many ways. But if it weren't for the success of this film we wouldn't have ""Terminator 2:Judgement Day""."

Also, for the first and last time we get to see Arnie playing bad- REALLY bad!- and although I love the humour of his ""good"" terminator in number 2, and even 3....there's something uniquely chilling about him as the villain.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe this film is nearly 30 years old- it knocks 95% of modern action films out of the park (someone tell me with a straight face they prefer The Expendables lol), and aside from the occasional inevitable dodgy special effect- the eye scene springs to mind- it has aged amazingly well.

And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before.<br/><br/>Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, ""Sarah Connor"". The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called ""Terminator 101"".<br/><br/>Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and cliché, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as ""a day like any other"", by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci – fi: time travel that had only been seen in ""Back to the Future "" with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in ""Planet of the apes"", also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone.<br/><br/>The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in ""Titanic"".<br/><br/>A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, ""The Terminator"" revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10"
"superferb","10","1","2","14 August 2013"," One of the best Films ever made
","The Terminator is easily one of the very best films ever made, in any genre. If i was to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island but could take 10 movies with me, quite probably this one would be on my list. Again, i'm not talking genre here; It's definitely one of the best SciFi/Action movies ever made, but it is also one of the best movies of all kinds ever made.<br/><br/>But let's stay with the action side of it for a while though: The action in this flick is simply awesome. Mostly done without special effects and surely without CGI, The Terminator defines cinematic action. This is what celluloid and cameras were invented for. This is the stuff aspiring filmmakers study in order to learn the craft of filming action. There are of course films with more action, but the quality of it is paramount here. Everything feels true, not a false moment, no laughable exagerrations. Camera angles, editing rhythm, performances. All elements are perfect and make the action reach you. This is how it should be done, and the reason why you're at the edge of your seat though you have seen much ""phatter"", ""cooler"", ""crasser"" action in the decades since 1984.<br/><br/>Let's have a look at the special effects now. I think the animatronics head shots are still absolutely valid today. The use of stop motion is totally visible, but those shots are not bad enough to catapult you out of the suspense. The model work is quite good most of the time, only some moments are a bit ludicrous. All in all, the effects are very watchable even in 2013 and far from being so bad that they would seriously impact the overall appeal of the film.<br/><br/>The music is awesome. I always hate it when a score dictates too much, when it is too classical for a movie, when it is too in-your-face, when it drowns action and emotion in too many notes, melodies, sounds. Here, the score is unnoticeable most of the time, which is always a good thing. Droning eerily in the background, it lets your senses focus on the carnage on the screen and the terror in your mind but also pushes the pace forward with its thumping industrial beats. Then there is the main theme; not much more than a single, brilliant melody, but powerful enough to transcend themes of love, pain, premonition. And when it finally echoes in the love scene, you understand in a split second that this is actually Sarah's theme and the whole movie is actually tinted with her emotions. In the factory scene, the music drastically changes into a horrifying medley of dissonant screeches, making the shift into the third Act just as audible as scraping away the Terminators living tissue and showing us the metal chassis underneath is making it visible.<br/><br/>There is not a single bad or even mediocre performance in this movie. All the actors are great, and i think Arnold does a hell of a job. Many people say he can't act but that he didn't need to here because he's playing a machine, so that it was alright. I think that's bullshit. Show me someone acting a machine and i show you someone looking real silly. *It's not that simple!* Arnold always knows what he does. He's a physical, agile actor, and perfect for the role, he makes you believe that this is a programmed killing machine, he makes the whole thing work. Biehn and Hamilton are at the top of their game and have a phenomenal chemistry. All the supporting actors do what they have to do perfectly.<br/><br/>One reviewer commented that ""the script is one that other screenwriters wished to have thought of first"". Another added that it is one of those scripts that is being teached in screen writing seminars; both is true. Cameron and Hurd delivered their masterpiece here. The story is strong, original and meaningful. There are no weak moments, no plot holes. The motivations are strong and genuine, and all the main characters arch. The finale leaves us with a very confident resolution, strong emotions of both the positive and negative variety and is very, very satisfying. In fact, the more you look at the story, the better it becomes.<br/><br/>Many people have criticized the time travel plot hole/paradox. But i think it all makes perfect sense: Reese is in his thirties, so he's born sometime between 1984 and 2029. He exists for one day in the year 1984, and for some thirty+ years in the ""future"". Connor sends him back, ending his existence in the year 2029. He dies in 1984, ending his existence altogether. You might ask ""but what would happen if Reese was killed before having sex with Sarah?"". But it's irrelevant. The story is what it is, just like you and me, we are here because our parents made love some day. The now is the result of all that happened, and the thing about The Terminator is that it gives Sarah a sneak preview of the future. So in the specific way the film deals with this kind of paradox, it also makes an intriguing statement about fate and predestination."
"badajoz-1","Null","1","2","2 November 2011"," Hits the spot every time!
","Forget all the timeline rubbish, and just watch a great simple thriller movie. Made before CGI it is all the better for it, as the story and action just follow a human-like robot that cannot be stopped chasing a naive young woman and her human protector. Both the robot and the protector are from the future so scifi is involved. But it is basically an updated chase movie based on the Frankenstein tropes and themes. The added love story works and the darkly lit sex scene does not get spoilt by actressy quibbles about getting kit off! James Cameron keeps the action moving, the script is taut, while Schwartzenegger is incredible for his passivity and menace (forget all the jokes about his acting and prepare to be frightened!). The following Terminator movies can never quite match up to the cheaper original!"
"theinaniloquent","9","1","2","23 October 2011"," ""Your future is in his hands""
","A human-looking, apparently unstoppable cyborg is sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor; Kyle Reese is sent to stop it.<br/><br/>James Cameron is most possibly one of the best (if not the best) movie directors of all time. I have finally gotten to take the chance to see the Terminator, and see for myself what it can behold. The special effects are amazing (mild complaint to the fully-exposed Terminator though) and everything is nice to see. The plot is pretty complex but works greatly and a nice one at that. I found myself intrigued of the near future and the possibilities of what could come. The action sequences left me at the edge of my seat and had actual suspense building up inside me. I could feel my adrenaline level going up high whenever the Terminator showed up on the screen. The story also presents a slowly built love story that will tie-in with the sequel. Although not being the main theme of the movie, it plays a big part of the other movies as I can tell. This highly intelligent action-thriller is great and seeing that the second film has a way higher score than this one, I am completely ready! 9/10."
"neil-476","Null","1","2","1 October 2011"," Simple but genius
","Sometimes the simple ideas are the best. In the future, a computer system was taken over the world and seeks to eliminate humanity. However, the human resistance, under the leadership of John Conner, is turning the tide. The computers send back a cyborg (a robot covered with flesh) back in time to kill John Conner's mother Sarah, so that John Conner never gets born. Conner, in turn, sends one of his lieutenants, Kyle Reese, back to protect his mother.<br/><br/>This film has science fiction trimmings, but it is essentially a chase movie - the cyborg Terminator is virtually unstoppable as it pursues Sarah and Kyle with a complete lack of emotion and total relentlessness. The simplicity of the concept leaves plenty of room for the plot developments, which are few but important.<br/><br/>This was a cheap film - James Cameron was not a big name director at this point - but, given its low budget, it is well staged with the exception of some of the effects which betray the lack of bucks behind them.<br/><br/>But as well as the strength of its simplicity, it has the additional strengths of immensely strong performances from Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner (transforming from cliché screaming bimbo to the flint-hard woman she needs to be to bring her son up to meet his destiny), and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. In truth, he doesn't need to do much more than keep a straight face and lend his remarkable physical presence to the implacable robot. And, in so doing, he planted his feet in the foundations of a film career which saw him become cinema's top box office draw for a decade."
"crazycoaster_kid99","9","1","2","16 August 2011"," One of my all-time favorites!
","This completely went beyond all my expectations. Non-stop action, and tons of ""what's gonna happen next?"" moments. I started watching it thinking it was gonna be good - it was great. If there's anything I didn't like, it was that they made the future seem so dark. Overall it had a great sense of being in the action from beginning to end. I sure didn't expect the terminator to die in the way he did, neither did I expect Reese to get killed either. Another thing I liked was that Sarah Connor didn't even believe Reese about the Terminator until the police station scene (that was pretty funny how she saw the Terminator get up after being shot in the club, and still didn't believe it). I do have a question, though. When the Terminator went into the gun shop, they didn't do a background check for him or make him sign any forms (before he shot the clerk). Imagine if they did...""Sir, you're from the future, you're a man-killing robot, and we can't sell you these."" But my point is - this is a great movie for both action and sci-fi lovers alike. Thumbs up."
"Kubris","9","1","2","30 July 2011"," Man vs. Machine
","IMDb Top 250: 168<br/><br/>The Terminator is a great action movie which can be eye candy or thought provoking, depending how you want to see it. At it's core, Terminator is about a violent cyborg trying to kill a woman. But it offers an eerie version of the future, and explores a conflict that was then unused- man vs. machine.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Ahnold. He's huge and intimidating, which just a little too much sneer. But accompanied with kickass weapons and a surprisingly good score, he dominates scenes like he was meant to.<br/><br/>The action is big, with some really cool scenes and chases. The 80's violence is much better than the 2029 action, which comes off as very cheesy to a modern audience. I can't really criticize though, as I have no idea what the standard was back then. The SFX also can't be criticized, but they haven't aged very well. The metal terminator looks like stop-motion, very jerky and it's distracting.<br/><br/>The story is a big winner. Vast, with lots of expansion room, and the plot tells a tight story with a twist. The time travel is very well handled, and reasonably makes sense. I can't wait to see T2 tonight.<br/><br/>The Terminator is a really cool action movie with brain and brawn, like District 9, a favourite of mine. As far as 80's action goes, I like the Terminator better than Die Hard. If you find it, see this classic. I'll be back.<br/><br/>*Edit- November 26, 2011* I change my opinion about few films. Apocalypse Now, Taxi Driver, and now The Terminator demand a second viewing to see if my opinion really changes. <br/><br/>The Terminator is an equal movie to my first viewing. But I realize that I underrated it the first time. The whole 80's-ness of it is awesome, with the punks, the sleazy L.A. streets, Reese's Nike's, tape recorders and Technoir. The music stands out more the second time, as do the hammy lines delivered by Michael Biehn in the first Act. But the future scenes feel a little better. They're really desolate and hopeless. <br/><br/>It's hard to describe, this film succeeds more than any other Terminator because of its atmosphere. It's a dark film, but it has heart. Where the sequel goes for the (mostly) more family approach (*shudder*) The Terminator is a pure, unaltered effort for the sake of cinema. It's so fresh. This is my favourite James Cameron film, beating out Aliens. I believe this stands among 80's classics like Back to the Future<br/><br/>8.3/10 *Edited score- 8.5/10*"
"bonepilot","9","1","2","12 July 2011"," A Classic that will continue grow
","I recently saw ""The Terminator"" on a movie channel after at least a 10 year hiatus. I'm happy to report that James Cameron's plot,and direction, and the gritty acting by Schwarzenegger, Hamilton and Biehn have NOT faded on the screen after all these years. Despite improvements in CGI, etc., the mesmerizing force of the titanium endoskeleton wrapped in synthetic tissue still causes the sci-fi fanatic in me to rejoice! It is also refreshing to see that no film has touched upon the idea of sending an agent back in time to destroy the creator of the future as well as this film does. Not only did this film come off as a huge success, but the following two sequels fell into place in a satisfying way. I can see that this film will continue to grow in its cult status over the years, based on its simplicity, thrills and suspense, and sheer action value. I've GOT to get the entire collection of all three films someday, so I won't have to ""stumble"" upon it by chance on a movie channel."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","2","7 May 2011"," Good start for a notorious sci-fi franchise and it's the film that was a big break for Arnold
","This is a excellent sci-fi movie for it's time, it has a lot of the elements in this mixed together but works very well. The main villain is the one that stands out the most, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is basically a full machine in this literally when it comes to the plot aka The Terminator and he played his role in a pretty intimidating and menacingly manner, although he seemed a bit human at times when he is suppose to be a machine which isn't good. Especially since he is the villain and should not be showing emotions when it comes to facial expressions for this first movie in the franchise, even if it's slight at times. Although it will be different in the sequel, but for this it came off as a bit of a mistake, especially the mannerism in certain scenes. He just didn't seem like a full machine that is out to kill it's target because he seemed human, so it made the experience a bit slightly less frightening. But for it's time it's done very well. This is the beginning of a very notorious movie franchise that many people know of or at least heard about and I can see why by just watching this first movie. The script is well written and got my attention most of the way through even if it's a outdated and certain scenes just look way too fake. But even now this movie still holds up in today's standards because of the good direction and because it's well crafted. This movie also has classic phrases that are notorious and the way it reveals what is going on bit by bit is done pretty well, although some audiences will know what is going on pretty quickly, the execution is well crafted. This is a sci-fi/action movie with elements of horror and romance in it, but it's blended in just right and is worth seeing even if it's outdated by today's standards by a large margin and is a thrill to watch.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

The final scene in the work place is bravado action excitement with a seemingly never ending fight sequence that generates as much excitement as the first few minutes, showing a good consistency to his works.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger as many know him at his best gives a wonderfully unemotional and perfectly inhumane performance as the evil Terminator and using very minimal dialogue has created an icon that can only be mimicked.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton in her most famous on screen performance braves the ordinary into the supernatural role perfectly with the right appreciation of panic and naivety to what is around her. Michael Biehn is wonderfully used as a frustrate figure of responsibility and as a saviour that gives the film a great balance of strong action with powerful dramatic implications.<br/><br/>Whilst there have been 3 sequels thus far and with a fifth in the offing, the story is far from over but with this originality and excellent appreciation of time consequence and action direction, will this picture ever be topped?"

","This movie is every bit as good as the second one in its own rights, first of all it does not feel outdated since the movie is set in the 1980s so it fits and the future flashbacks are awesome- Kyle Reese is awesome too and also and in my opinion this T-850 is more relentless than the T-1000 since he does not hesitate in the kills- the T-1000 is still awesome and sleeker but the T-850 is more threatening in this movie. This film is violent, grim, and with a glimmer of hope with Reese and Connor, the way is supposed to be. Not to mention Brad Fiedel's metallic score matches the film perfectly as a Tech-Noir film. Sarah's evolution from a lowly waitress to the mother of the leader of the human resistance is believable. This film also has lots of backstory relating to the Terminator franchise and is essential to view for any Terminator fan out there."
"hnt_dnl","10","1","2","22 March 2010"," A real masterpiece
","Recently, I was listening to a discussion about filmmakers and the person leading the talk explained why he thinks that their best films (even the best directors) are usually their first ones or early ones and the explanation was amazingly simple...It boils down to this...""The director has his/her personal vision that they've always wanted to translate to the screen, the studios don't really know what to make of the film b/c it's so original, so they take a chance thinking the director will tank, but then the film's originality wins out."" With minimal studio involvement or interference, a filmmaker with a great idea that is perfectly executed can put out a masterpiece straight away...And that's what James Cameron did with THE TERMINATOR! <br/><br/>THE TERMINATOR (1984) is one of Cameron's earliest films, and to me, it is still to this day his BEST film! I hear and read all the time of so many people fawning all over T2:JUDGMENT DAY as being superior to the original TERMINATOR, but I cannot disagree more. T2 is essentially a a loud summer ""action"" movie with great effects and one-dimensional characters, whereas the original TERMINATOR is an amalgamation of sci-fi, horror, action (yes, there is that!), and is very forward-thinking in its premise: it dares to forewarn us about a bleak, apocalyptic future in a rather unsettling, plausible way. The way that THE TERMINATOR presents itself really does scare the heck out of me! I personally don't think any of Cameron's other films (including the heavily overrated ALIENS and T2) are in the vicinity of greatness that THE TERMINATOR is.<br/><br/>THE TERMINATOR stars the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger in perhaps his greatest film performance. You can tell a performance is great when it still holds up after 20+ years! Schwarzenegger is truly confident, convincing, and terrifying as the T800, a killing machine from the future (2029) tasked to kill ""The Mother of the Future"" Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton in a heartbreaking and powerful performance). Sarah is to be the mother of John Connor, the leader of the future resistance. John sends back one of his soldiers Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn in a provocative, convincing performance). Both Biehn and Schwarzenegger's characters truly come off as ""otherwordly"", with no interest or use for the present day foibles and nonsense. These actors' authenticity as futuristic beings make THE TERMINATOR more than the typical sci-fi fare. To this day, I say that these 3 underrated performances of Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Biehn, are among the best in the sci-fi genre.<br/><br/>In addition to THE TERMINATOR having so much going for it as a multi-genre film, another thing I love about this over the sequels is that we actually don't see the pivotal character of John Connor. Of course, since he is still in the future, we can't see him, but it keeps the character a larger-than-life that we actually don't see him. Another big plus is that in addition to the main 3 actors, the supporting cast is exceptional: Paul Winfield as the skeptical police Lt. Traxler, Lance Henriksen as his wisecracking detective sidekick, and most notably Earl Boen as psychiatrist Dr. Silberman, who is equally fascinated and mocking of Reese's story of an apocalyptic future.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, Cameron impressively mixes several genres well into this groundbreaking film. It spawned a lot of wannabes and you can see the influence on some of the later big 80s sci-fi movies like ALIENS, ROBOCOP, and THE HIDDEN. But THE TERMINATOR. But this film has an added ""bonus"" of helplessness and hopelessness that permeates throughout. If Sarah Connor dies, then supposedly machines will take over the world. If Sarah Connor lives, then the world has a bleak future ahead of it fighting said machines.<br/><br/>The last (and most important!) ingredient that makes THE TERMINATOR superior to it's sequels is in the title character. I'm actually a monumental fan of Schwarzenegger and most of his movies, and although he went the traditional action star route cashing in on his star-making role here (Cameron even made Arnie the ""good guy"" terminator in the sequels!), he can claim to bringing to the screen the most terrifying, remorseless killing machine in the history of cinema!"

","The Terminator is a must see film for everyone, it's a sci-fi/thriller of epic proportions, it may look dated now as it was made in 1984, but then again the film is set in 1984 so it shouldn't be considered a big deal.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is fairly simple, in the future there is a war between humans and machines and the machines are fighting a loosing battle and the reason for them loosing is because of a man named (John Connor) who is the leader of the human resistance and is the only man who knows how to stop the machines, so the machines decide to send one of their Android assassins called The Terminator back through time to kill john connor's mother(Sarah Connor) thus preventing john connor from being born and the machines being humanity's successor. however the human resistance is aware of this scheme and they also send in their toughest soldier (Kyle Reese; who is only human) to go and protect sarah connor from the terminator and what follows is an intense fight for survival for both Sarah connor and Kyle Reese who are up against a seemingly unstoppable killing machine.<br/><br/>What makes the terminator such an incredible movie is that it's very clever, the plot line is not 100% original but it is very interesting and raises a question about humanity's future, ""Will Technology Reach a point where humans will no longer be in charge of society?"" Now it may not seem very likely that it will happen but as you can see everyone is updating on the latest computer technology and gadgets and you start to wonder when watching the movie how far will it go?<br/><br/>The Director of the film (James Cameron) shows us a dark vision of the future with the war torn battlefields and giant robotic tanks killing humans, these scenes are not only cool to see but also truly frightening it's a place that you would not wan't to be.<br/><br/>And the cast of the movie is well chosen the terminator is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger who is without a doubt the perfect choice for the role,as he looks very intimidating and shows no sign of emotion and you believe him in the role. Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton is also great in her role of a regular young woman who is unaware of the terror that is about to come her way and as time goes on she has to become strong in mind and body in order to survive, and Kyle Reese played brilliantly by Michael Biehn gives her encouragement throughout the film and plays the ultimate human protector as he is the one who knows more about the terminator than anyone else, and he has to rely on his own ingenuity to not only protect sarah but also himself. <br/><br/>Now the special effects are very dated but there are some that still hold up to this day, the most dated special effect has to be the stop motion terminator endoskeleton in the end but then again it makes the terminator look more believable as it looks more robotic. The Action scenes are good and will keep you entertained, but don't go in expecting transformers.<br/><br/>Overall: The Terminator is a classic in the Sci-Fi and Thriller Genre Check this movie out, you will definitely will get some entertainment out of it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"i77310","9","1","2","28 November 2009"," Classic film from James Cameron!
","I have seen this film a few times over the course of my life. The first time happened when I was still in lower primary; the second time from a heavily edited videotape in a library. By now, I have lost count of how many times I've viewed this horror science fiction classic. But one thing is sure, it will never fail to amaze and shock (especially for new viewers it would make a real treat), standing the test of time as one of the cinema's most popular and successful trilogies, and for me, most favorite! I have to confess I enjoy T2 Judgment Day as well, but it kind of drags in the middle and the violence isn't as ferocious, partly maybe because John Conner is still a kid then. But in T1, it's a roller coaster, full-blown ride of non-stop action with not a single boring moment, every scene is crucial to the story and the violence is bared for all to see the kind of urgent and desperate situation our heroes are in.<br/><br/>Everybody who goes to cinema and not living under the rock all these years will know the storyline in their sleep: Skynet, a computer system, nearly wiped out the entire human population in 1997. It has found a way to send its cyborg- Cyberdyne system model 101, a T800, also called the Terminator, back to 1984 to search and terminate the mother of John Conner, who would ultimately lead the human's victory against the machines, before she could give birth. In return, the Resistance sends a warrior, Kyle Reese, to protect her.<br/><br/>'The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present. Tonight....'<br/><br/>You get to see the bleak, skull-littered future landscape, army of terminators armed with lethal machine guns as their heads swirl and red laser-beamed eyes scour for any Resistance soldiers.<br/><br/>'Don't you understand? It can't be bargained with; it can't feel pain or mercy, and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead.' I still get the chills down my spine every time I hear Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) seethes, 'Come with me if you want to live.' As Sarah Connor (Linda Hamiliton) looks on, feeling the impact of the serious danger she is in.<br/><br/>Both Kyle and Sarah are tough characters who also brings out the vulnerability as human beings, where most people can relate to, a couple of refugees on the run from a deadly, sophisticated machine programmed to destroy them. They have no other help, only finding strength and comfort in their love for each other, burden from the pressure of carrying the weight of the future on their shoulders.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the brilliant killing machine itself- the T800- Arnold Schwarzenegger's most iconic role in his career. He may have only uttered 74 words (including the unforgettable catchy phase: I'll be back) in the entire film, but his presence more than compensates for it. The scene where he self-repairs facing a mirror definitely leaves an impression on me. Plucking out and dropping his human eyeball, with blood dispersing the sink's clear water, is fascinating to see. Then, before you can even hold your breathe, he cuts open his skin as if it is merely made of rubber, and you get to see the complicated endoskeleton underneath.<br/><br/>The last climax mounts after Kyle sacrifices himself to save Sarah, but the Terminator isn't dead. So it is man, or woman, versus machine, as she crawls in her injured leg, struggles not only for her life, but for the entire human race. With a 'You are terminated, f**ker,' it is crushed to a lump of scrap metal. The nightmare is over, for now. And you just know that there's got to be a sequence, because this is one cyborg/machine/terminator that no one will ever get tired of.<br/><br/>The Terminator succeeds and excels in action, horror, romance, adventure and in every way any science fiction fan could possibly ask for. And it will definitely remain as one of my most favorite movies of all time."

","The Terminator is a modern classic. It is a great example of action cinema, making Arnold Schwarzenegger in a superhero, being James Cameron's first major hit and cements Stan Winston reputation as a special effects wizard.<br/><br/>The premise of The Terminator is simple, a cyborg is sent back in time to kill the mother of the leader of the human resistance before he is born. In the year 2029, the world is in the aftermath of a nuclear war and machines have taken over the world. But the machines have lost to the human resistance, and they send back a Terminator (800-series) (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to kill Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton). The humans send Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) as a protector, and both have to battle to cyborg and the police to save themselves.<br/><br/>The story is simple and effective. It is just a mighty entertaining film, with great dialogue and wonderful action scene. They are visions of an apocalyptic future, as well as the scenes set in 1984, with The Terminator and Kyle Reese cause death and destruction across Los Andreas. James Cameron shows his skill as a writer and director, focusing on character development of his two main characters, showing how Sarah Conner turned from a scared kid to a strong woman that she becomes. The Terminator is show to be a totally ruthless machine, and it is easily the best role Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever done. I love the use of models, showing the dedication of James Cameron and Stan Winston to the project. They were great designs throughout the film. The film does have a B-Movie feel to it, but that what people like about it. It was meant to be fun. It is an example of gun porn and the fear of nuclear war which is often a theme in Cameron's films.<br/><br/>A must see for film fans."
"ingemar-4","10","1","2","22 September 2009"," Icon SF action thriller
","This is one of the great classics in the SF action genre (along with Alien), and a terrific example that budget and quality are remarkably unrelated. The big breakthroughs are made on tights budgets. It has a truly original concept, really well performed. I can't find any big holes in the plot like too many movies have. I can't even find small ones. Well, except for the time travel paradox of course.<br/><br/>The whole story is tight, extremely well planned and executed. There doesn't seem to be a single second that isn't well timed. Of course, the actors help - not a single bad performance. Not only are Hamilton and Biehn doing their parts nicely, and stone faced Arnold of course, but all the side roles are just as fine. Cameron seems to have been doing the best directing of his life.<br/><br/>25 years after its release, only some animations in the end feel dated (and to be frank, they were pretty bad even back then, certainly a budget problem). Today, the animations would be smoother. Let's accept that as it is. All the rest is 100%, as close to perfect that an action movie can get.<br/><br/>It also stands as an example that action doesn't come from numbers of bad guys. One is much better than hundreds.<br/><br/>What is there not to like? Again, some crude animations. And if you just don't want action you want to watch something else, certainly. There is blood, gore and violence. And if you don't like nudity there is a scene or two to skip. and you have to accept that time travel works despite that it doesn't. If you want Arnold as a hero and speaking more, this is not for you. But I don't say that as criticism to the movie, only stating what should keep some from it."

","""The Terminator"" is the movie that made James Cameron a star, and the same goes for Arnold Shwarzanegger. This is a film that is creative, smart, strange, and entertaining, and it always has the same impact each time you watch it.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor is a happy woman with a good life. That is, until some weird, strong bad guy tries to hunt her down. The only person who can protect Sarah is Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future. Reese is in the present time because he has been sent from the future to save Sarah from The Terminator, the wacko cyborg that's been trying to kill her. The Terminator is here because Sarah is the future mother of John Connor, the young boy that will save mankind from the apocalypse. There's not too many ways to stop The Terminator. It can't be reasoned with, you can't shoot it down, it shows no pain, and it won't leave Sarah alone until she is dead. Now, it's up to Sarah and Kyle to do everything in their power to survive, and stop The Terminator dead in his tracks.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" is one of the most perfect sci-fi thrillers, complete with wonderful direction, a very original story, a terrific cast, a bad-ass villain, and some of the hippest special effects of the 80s. The film never becomes cartoonish, which is what other sci-fi movies become. The character of The Terminator becomes creepy at times in the fact that you can't stop it.<br/><br/>The cast is flawless. Arnold Shwarzanegger is superior in the role that made him a star. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are also very good as Sarah and Reese. You will also catch a cameo from an early Lance Henriksen as a cop.<br/><br/>The verdict: You're going to laugh at this, but I had never seen ""The Terminator"" until just recently. I'm glad I did. This is the movie that gave birth to the careers of many famous people, and it has a bunch of famous quotes. ""The Terminator"" is the invention of the original sci-fi action thriller.

The best sci-fi movie ever made because it didn't have all that weird-o confusing talk about space and all that bull crap like from 'Star Trek'. The theme song to this movie is great! It makes you feel scared and sad at the same time. The best out of all The Terminator movies. And one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a movie for everyone! There is action, romance, and even at parts it's like a slasher movie because the villain in this movie is very much like a slasher villain.

Linda Hamilton plays the damsel in distress against type and Michael Biehn is good as a damaged hero from the future. Mention should also go to Lance Henrikson and Paul Winfield who do a wonderful double act as the cops investigating the Terminator's killing spree.<br/><br/>It's a testament to Cameron and the work of Stan Winston that this film looks like a big budget film rather than the $6m it actually cost.

","First of all I would just like to point out that James Cameron is my favourite director of all time, as he has made films such as The Terminator, Aliens and of course, Terminator 2. If you have seen Terminator 2 or 3, you may not have seen the original. It is completely different to all of it sequels in a good way, and that is what I like about it. <br/><br/>The story is basically about the war between humans and machines in 2029, and the machines send back to a Terminator to kill Sarah Conor, as she gives birth to John Conor, the leader of the human resistance. Although it seems like all hope is lost, the humans send back one of there soldiers, Kyle Reece. <br/><br/>Only one person would be able to play Terminator, and that would be Arnold. He has the mood that the Terminator needs, and defiantly makes people laugh with all his lines throughout the films. Michael Bhien was also brilliant as Kyle Reece. It is hard too describe what genre this film can be classified as. It could be action due to how many times The Terminator, Kyle Reece and Sarah Conor meet the police. It could be horror due to all the deaths The Terminator causes, which could also be classified as slasher. <br/><br/>The only problem I have with the film is the music, which is that 80's dance music which I hate, whereas T2 has some great music. Defiantly check this film out though as I am sure you will enjoy it, even though it is not as good as T2!"

NO.<br/><br/>The Terminator is without a doubt the defining Sci-Fi action film of all time. though future films of the same genre may have been better, this one stands alone as the founder of the marriage between Science-Fiction and Action films.<br/><br/>The plot centers around the destruction of the world as we know it, due to computers becoming self-aware and destroying their makers: Humans. After a machine-induced nuclear holocaust, human survivors fight back against the machines, led by a man named John Connor. A computer-soldier called a ""Terminator"" is sent back in time by the machines, to kill the mother of John Connor, so he can never be born. The human resistance also sends one of their soldiers back in time, to protect the unborn child. Both soldiers are sent back to 1984, to battle over the fate of their future.<br/><br/>Terminator is known as one of the most iconic story lines of all time, and rightfully so. This is one of those classics that has to be watched by any movie fanatic. It is one of the defining films of the 80's and the Sci-Fi genre.<br/><br/>Taking this film simply as another sci-fi film, you may find it to be not much better than others.

","The Terminator is the first and best film of the Terminator Films and easily one of the best action films I have seen. Schwarzenneggar makes this film and this is his best performance in a film in my opinion.<br/><br/>The Terminator machine is sent back to the year 1984. His purpose, to kill Sarah Conner and prevent her from giving birth to her son who will go on to lead humans to victory over the machines. Kyle Reese, a human, also gets sent back to the same year in order to protect Sarah from The Terminator.<br/><br/>The Terminator is one of the greatest villains ever. Relentless, he only has one purpose in this film, to kill Sarah Conner. He has no emotion or care for anything or anyone. Completely cold and evil machine. Schwarrzenneggar does such a great job of portraying him, he really moves and acts like a cybornetic machine would. Awesome villain and portrayal in this film. I like Arnold better in this villain role than in the hero role he plays in the sequels to The Terminator.<br/><br/>Also I liked the acting and characters of Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner. Reese is a great character to play the military guy intent on protecting Conner. Linda Hamilton does great as Sara Conner and really does a good job playing the women who goes from being scared and weak to being a strong woman who is able to protect herself.<br/><br/>The setting is great. I really like how most of the film takes place during the night, giving it a dark feel. ALso love how whenever The Terminator is on screen there is the sound of a deep drum beating continuously. That just adds to the setting and also makes The Terminator to seem like an evil thing.<br/><br/>THe action is great. Car chases, attacks in clubs and police stations, and a chase through a factory at night. It just is great action.<br/><br/>To conclude, I think this is easily the best of the Terminator Franchise. Great villain, tone and setting, and acting. Recommended to the highest."

In self protection, the computer called Sky-Net designs an incredible robotic machine called the Terminator 100 series or T-100 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) with a single purpose; to travel to the past, 1984, to be exact and seek out a woman called Sara Conners (Linda Hamilton) and kill her. The extraordinary robot is made of nearly impervious metallic parts with living human tissue on the outside. It's purpose is clear, eliminate Sara and her son in the future will die. The Humans of the future therefore send Sgt. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect her in the past. Once there, Reese is hampered by obsolete weapons, bumbling detectives like Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield), Hal Vukovich (Lance Henriksen), who discredit the story, a disbelieving psychiatrist, Peter Silberman (Earl Boem) and a whole precinct of ambivalent policemen. Despite their station coming under attack, eviscerated and virtually annihilated, none take heed of the unstopped machine now loose in their city. It's up to Sara and Reese to try and stay ahead of the unstopped cyborg.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9","1","2","1 December 2008"," Excellent, holds up unbelievably well
","There are a lot of marvelous reasons to love this. What exactly they are may vary, but I can give you my suggestions for a couple: It mixes a bleak, dystopian future vision with breathtaking, mind-blowing action(and without becoming a film that can't inspire you to think, and that goes for others done by the man who helmed this), and does so extremely well. It is blessed with the enthusiastic and perfectionistic direction of James Cameron, and it shows. The pacing is utterly impeccable. I could not tell you how many times I've watched this. The plot and science fiction are both fantastic, well-thought out, and hold up to thorough scrutiny, I've yet to find a genuine problem in them. The concept is terrifying, smart and thrilling. It all unfolds rather well. The script in general is spectacularly well-done. This never runs out of steam, and in spite of intensity, it doesn't overwhelm, either. All three of the listed genres are masterfully achieved here, and I would agree with anyone suggesting that ""horror"" should be mentioned, as well. The acting is magnificent, the performances are spot-on. Not sure I'd say that there are any exceptions to that. I became a fan of Biehn from viewing this. Schwarzenegger does pretty darn amazing. Henriksen is a lot of fun to watch, intentionally so. Lines are well-written and equally well-delivered. The score is synthesized and is a perfect fit. The music, clothes and special effects(which are almost invariably still incredible) are the only aspects of this that date it any. The guns are tremendously well chosen and handled(read the Trivia to see Arnie's efforts in that area). There is violence and some relatively disturbing sights in this, as well as a little sexuality/nudity, and a moderate amount of language, that can get strong. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the notion of an exciting movie with gun-fights, car-chases, a dark tone, well-done sci-fi, that just might provide food for thought, if you go in looking for that. 9/10"
"KillerLord","10","1","2","29 September 2008"," The Movie That Created The One Really Famous Line!
","The Terminator is truly an action and sci-fi classic, no doubt that. It has all the right elements in it. A good plot, a good cast, good action sequences and a wonderful director in the form of James Cameron. The story is about a machine that looks like a human being, a cyborg, who has been sent back in time in order to kill a certain lady named Sarah Conner. She has to be killed so that John Conner, who is her son, does not exist. His birth has to be prevented because John Conner is going to lead the human resistance against the machines. Needless to say, it is the machines that have sent back this machine to do the job. <br/><br/>But the human resistance is well aware of this mission and plot. So, the human resistance sends a noble warrior to aid Sarah Conner. And no, this warrior is not a machine too. He is a human being but someone who comes from a time where he has seen enough of these machines to know how to possibly take care of one to some extent. And the chase is on. The Terminator hunts down Sarah and tries to do his job. And of course, there is someone who is going to prevent that from happening. <br/><br/>Arnold has a perfect physique and the right face to play the role of the cyborg. It is not that easy to be expressionless like a cyborg and Arnold convinces us thoroughly that he indeed is a machine who just happens to look like a human being. Sarah's protector does a wonderful job as the human warrior that he is. Linda Hamilton, playing Sarah also brings about the right range of expressions to suit her role. All in all, the cast is fantastic. And add to this, the beautiful and clean direction of Cameron and the wonderful special effects, this movie becomes what it is - a great masterpiece. <br/><br/>There are some people of course who find this movie a little dull compared to the second part of the movie i.e. Terminator 2 : Judgment Day. There is no doubt about the fact that T2 is indeed a wonderful movie but at the same time one must not forget that this movie comes out way before T2 and considering the time in which the movie was made, what has been showcased in this chapter of the Terminator story, is simply amazing."

","This is the most groundbreaking action film of all time. Dirty Harry and Die Hard deserve some credit but this is just phenomenal. The exposition is great. The story develops quickly and each character is different. Unlike most action films we aren't given a character who goes nowhere, Sarah Connor (Hamilton) develops into the strong woman we see in the second film during the course of this film. The T-101 is acted well by Schwarzenegger, and before you say anyone can act like a robot know this; Schwarzenegger came up with most of the ways the T-101 moved. When he is searching for Kyle Reese (Biehn) and Sarah he moves his eyes and then his head giving him the resemblance of a surveillance camera. It's little things like that which gives his performance a little bit of extra weight. Michael Biehn is believable as Kyle Reese and takes the part very seriously and it paid off for the film. The special effects are excellent for such a low budget film and the dark look adds to the intensity that the film already carries. The music isn't typical Hollywood either it is always complimenting the danger the characters are facing. This is a fantastic film, a must see movie for everyone. Only one flaw and which is that in one scene the stop-motion isn't very good, but other than that perfect."

"AvhHines","10","1","2","5 November 2006"," Cameron does effects and action to sell his stories
","So many people write James Cameron off as a writer/director who specializes in action and special effects. While it's true that almost no one does either better, I have always believed that Cameron uses these tools in order to get people to see his stories - not the other way around as some here seem to think. Cameron is a sci-fi buff and a true romantic in the original sense (i.e. romance not necessarily as sexual love, but adventure and belief in greater possibilities than mundane life often suggests).<br/><br/>I remember being made to watch this movie in 1986 by my then boyfriend, having assumed from its star (Schwarzenegger) and its title that it was simply mindless, stupid violence. The first few minutes, showing the war in the future, made me realize that I'd been completely wrong - as a fan of science fiction books, I realized I was seeing the real thing as only Kubrick, Lucas, and Spielberg had done it thus far. I became a Cameron fan then and there; all the elements he has shown since were demonstrated: a compelling story that always centers on a real love (whether it be between a couple, or a child and parents), a sharp sense of humor coupled with a slight sadness or wistful element, flawless art direction and as good effects as can be got for the money and time it was made, highly believable performances, and an utter relentlessness that, each time you think it's finally over, turns out not to be.<br/><br/>I see time and time again the criticism that the movie is dated in its styles of clothing, music, and cars. This puzzles me. You don't watch a movie of the thirties or forties and think how dated it is; it was made when it was made and reflects that time. I can only figure that a lot of folks remember themselves in the eighties and somehow now are embarrassed that they followed the fashions of the times and not those now current twenty years later. This is silly; how could you or a movie of the eighties have incorporated the customs or tastes of a later time? The movie was made in 1984 and has its characters dressed, listening to music, and driving cars accordingly - get over it! Probably one of the primary reasons this criticism comes up is that the movie has held up so well in other ways. Hundreds of sci-fi movies have been made since, and yet, except for the weakness of some of the stop-action effects of the endo-skeleton Terminator, this movie can pretty much hold its own with any of them. In fact, I suspect that had not Cameron done The Terminator and, shortly thereafter, Aliens, sci-fi movies would not be what they are today. This movie ranks with Star Wars in raising the bar as to what constitutes good sci-fi in movies and few, if any, since have quite equalled them.<br/><br/>If you have somehow managed to miss this movie, and enjoy a story with crisp dialog, good performances, incredible suspense, and a truly moving love story, I suggest you get your hands on a copy ASAP. I doubt you'll regret it."

Not this time, my friends and I walked out as if we had seen the goriest snuff film ever made. However I don't want to give off the impression that this was a bad feeling, indeed we went back the next day to see it again! We would feel the same way after seeing Aliens. The Terminator though was unlike anything we had ever seen, the pace was brutal and the action sequences were frightening in their intensity.

","There is simply no flaw in this movie. From casting, to direction to the great script. Arnie was born to do this role. Michael was a perfect hero and James was the only to pull it out, by his standards. Arnie had a very small amount of lines but more-less all of them are memorable. From ""i'll be back"" to his multiply options of answers while repairing his face damage. Even Reese's one-liners like ""Come with me if u want 2 live"" are legendary. And our main hero dies. I mean in how many movies nowadays this happen? I was always against any syrupy happy-endings but this one is just about perfect. What about that picture at the end? The beginnings of this masterpiece might be in some other classics like ""Blade runner"" or ""Mad Max"", than Cameron definitely borrowed from ""Westworld"", but somehow he managed to create his own space. There are countless books written about it and there will always be a debate which one is better T1 or T2? For me personally after more than 10000 movies seen there are just a few with 10 points. Terminator is one of them.Star Wars, Matrix and Alien come up to the near second in sci-fi section but ""I'll be back!"" rules. Still after more than 20 years it is not dated or outlived. It still has the visual flair, ""that accent"" and just a great story. Made on low budget it became one of the most influential movies of 80's, and 4 me it is the original and best ever sci-fi movie 'till now."

","What a story. Go back in time to eliminate your enemy before he is born. That's Si-Fi! And again the atmosphere represents the time this film was made in. In every moment I can recall that it were the 80'sand especially 1984. This is definitely a formative film of the 80's. Overmore it's full of action and you can't take a breath for even a second. The script is congenial strait but leaves enough space for short romantic intimacy. And what a great soundtrack. It always seems as if there is something looming in the dark; where you can't see. Arnie did what he can do best and he gave us one of the most famous One-Liners in film history. The fact that all the actors were at the beginning of their career was a stroke of luck because the unbelievable atmosphere couldn't have been realized otherwise. ""I'll be back."" I'll take it as a promise, Arnie."
"clementtuffreau","10","1","2","4 May 2006"," a cold war masterpiece
","As used to say a friend of mine watching Terminator : cold war masterpiece. You couldn't say it a better way. James Cameron's best movie might be the most dry movie you'll ever see. It is not a movie, in fact, it is a tunnel. Once you enter it, you cannot go out until the end. The talent of great directors is to operate a kind of fusion between a great universal story (here : primal fear, pure fear, and violence) and powerful images. The talent of genius is to invent a character that will be used out of the context of the art form : it has been the case for Lewis Carrol's Alice, Jerry Siegel's Superman, it is the case for TERMINATOR. Cameron, alongside with Schwarzenneger, has invented a legend : the pure, the perfect killing machine. It never stops. The Terminator is the definition of cinema : once the film has started, it wont stop until THE END. Once the Terminator arrives, it won't stop either. After that very simple (but so powerful) basic rule, Cameron has just put everything he had in his hands to make it quick, straight and super clear. The editing is direct. Pictures are clear. Music is brilliant, reminding of Carpenter's Assault, meeting with an industrial rock band. Each element of the script is given in a short dialog between bullets storm. So why a cold war masterpiece ? Well, with this dark light, poor areas, lost streets, suburbs houses looking all alike, with Schwarzenneger and his very far far away English accent, you've never seen a movie making the USA look that close to the Soviet Union."

If you ask me, Arnold and Linda Hamilton deliver electrifying performances that are out of this world. It's hard to imagine Arnold as the bad guy, though. Even so, I enjoyed this movie very much. When Sarah (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle (Michael Biehn) were being pursued by the terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. In conclusion, if you like thrillers that will blow you away or are a fan of Arnold or Linda Hamilton, I strongly recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat thriller that's sure to make you feel good and take your breath away."

Have seen it quite a number of times during these 15 years and it still does not wear out.<br/><br/>The vocabulary of the cyborg is very curt and mature. So is the movie. The effects are restrained but notably to the point. The dark atmosphere is superb. The shootout in the police department is not bad at all. It is a real highlight.<br/><br/>Bad thing is a sex scene. Do we really have to take this ""Emmanuelle"" crap in order to know that this soldier is the father of the future John? It should have been moved to the deleted scenes (can't help mentioning ""First Blood"" as a pure example of a very clever move in a similar case). Absence of this (as well as some verbal hints) would have added more mystery (like ""Is that man the father of John Connor or not?""). A pair of additional bloody fist fights or shoot-out scenes instead would have been quite nice though.<br/><br/>Still, cannot give it a lower mark - it is a very rare example of tough revolutionary cinema.

I love the part where he punches right into the chest cavity of that punk. I also thought the part at the end where his skin melts off and he is coming after them was eerie. Perfect.

","The Terminator, one of James Cameron's greatest films, has everything that you could look for in a movie. It has romance, science fiction, horror, and action all rolled into one fantastic film. There isn't much let up, much like Aliens, a film made two years later and also one of his best.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton in one of her best roles) has no idea what's in store for her. She a waitress just trying to get by, but her life's about to be turned upside down. Unknown to her in the present she is, in the not too distant future, going to give birth to a son named John Connor who will be an influential leader in the year 2029 and help the rebels defeat the machines and the super computer Skynet.<br/><br/>Skynet knows this and sends one of it's virtually indestructible cyborgs (Arnold Swarzennegger in his greatest role) back to Sarah Connor's present to kill her before she can conceive. However the rebels have sent one of their own back to protect her, a man named Reese (Michael Biehn). What follows is one of the most creative concepts for a movie. This movie is filled with almost non-stop action, and on top of all that it is a romance as well as a science fiction or horror movie. Take your pick.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is great, and Cameron's pacing is perfect in that he knows when to slow down and when to pick it back up. My only problem with the movie was some of the special effects now seem dated. However, you got to realize that this movie was made back in 1984, so I can forgive it that much.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite films, and it is probably Swarzennegger's best movie to date. Yes I like Terminator 2, but it wasn't quite as good as the original even though the special effects had, of course, improved.<br/><br/>Some of the concepts of time seem a little much. But you have to realize that this is, at its heart, mainly a science fiction film, and one of the best ever made. I loved it and would recommend it to anybody."

","I saw this for the first time as a kid, watching with my family and was glued to the screen for the entire movie. Relentless action and well thought out plot and excellent cinematography, and acting help to make this one of the classic violent, sci-fi movies of all time. It is dated in a non bad way on certain effects and with the synthesizer soundtrack; (which i love and think it adds to the atmosphere of the movie, even from the opening credits. Perhaps it is effective because it is machine made and therefore emphasis the emotionless quality behind the Terminator.) Suspense is kept up through the entire movie especially picking up during the dance club scene as you wonder how the Terminator can just keep coming at you. Arnold truly portrayed the Terminator as an emotionless (in a good way) automoton bent on completing the mission at all cost. The actors have wonderful chemistry and were cast well including the psychiatrist and the police officers. It is fun to watch the heroine and hero grow through the movie as other posters have said. This is still one of my favorite well-made sci-fi action movies of all time and it truly set a milestone in cinema history."

","The Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn, is about a dark future of Earth that leads to a battle in present day. How can this be? Simply, in 2029 time travel will be possible.<br/><br/>The mission for the Terminator is simple: kill Sarah Connor. Destroy anything or anyone that tries to prevent this from happening.<br/><br/>The mission for Kyle Reese isn't so simple: locate Sarah Connor and prevent her from being destroyed by the Terminator.<br/><br/>The movie does quite a nice job of explaining many details. You learn quite a bit about all of the basics of the future war, how the machines come to power, primarily when Reese explains all of this to Connor.<br/><br/>It's a fairly simple plot and isn't difficult to understand. This is acceptable, because it's an action movie and doesn't really need much explanation. Of course, as an action movie this movie definitely delivers, with some very detailed and gory scenes. A few examples are the Terminator punching through someone and pulling his arm out, the killing of 30 law officers in a police station, and point blank assassinations of Sarah Connors. The movie can be very creepy as well, so there is some potential scare factor as well.<br/><br/>As of this writing, The Terminator does show a few signs of aging. The music is very 80s with a lot of synthesizers. There's the typical big 80's hair. A lot of the props are date-able as well, such as the cars.<br/><br/>This really can be overlooked though, because end to end this action flick is spectacular.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Hellrazr360","9","1","2","3 February 2006"," ""I'll Be Back"", For This Masterpiece Several Times
","Terminator is one of those unforgettable masterpieces that will always be admired for how it stunned us. How Cameron managed to create such a tense and passionate movie is, needless to say, amazing.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure most of you are aware of the plot of the Terminator movies so I'll spare you those details, despite their importance. But the plot of the Terminator movies introduced here is both intriguing and interesting. The whole story is given to the audience by Micheal Beihn, who does an excellent job of fulfilling his role. Beihn also gives some excellent and memorable lines while delivering the story and gives each and every detail great seriousness. It's this effect that Beihn manages to pull off that helps the viewer get drawn in by this movie's story.<br/><br/>Actors Lance Heinriksen, Bill Paxton and actress Linda Hamilton also make appearances in this movie, which may very well be the movie that got their careers started. But of course I'd be a fool to talk about Terminator's performers without mentioning the T-Man himself, Arnold. I don't think anyone could play our favorite cyborg like Arnie himself did. It's Arnold's unique, robot-like voice that gives him such an authentic acting flair in this movie, especially the good shape he was in. As the Terminator himself, Arnie got the pleasure of taking the load of action scenes, but with those scenes comes guns, which we know he loves.<br/><br/>Hamilton has the next largest role in the movie next to Arnold and Beihn, and she's does a great job herself. Hamilton does excellent at acting as a hard-working girl early in the film and does even better as someone who has to deal with an undeniable truth. The rest of the cast let the movie flow its way but do their importance when it comes, which is something most movies avoid nowadays.<br/><br/>The presentation of the Terminator isn't flashy, but what else would you expect from a film from the mid 80's. The action in the Terminator is both tense and very satisfying. Add that to the near-perfect style of the rest of the movie up till the end and the Terminator is a movie that you will not be disappointed by."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","1","2","23 January 2006"," A Classic
","The Terminator is the quintessential action film and the best of the series. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the Terminator, a cyborg from the future who is sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), because she will eventually give birth to John Connor, the man who will become the leader of the human resistance in the war against the machines. The soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent back to protect her. <br/><br/>T1 has a dark and gritty atmosphere that the second and third films do not have, which can be partially attributed to the fact that most of the movie takes place at night. IMO, the film's strongest quality is Arnold's terrifying presence; whenever he is on screen, there is a feeling of impending doom. This aura of dread makes it feel like Sarah and Kyle's chances of survival are about a million to one. My heart just goes out to them whenever I watch it. Another one of The Terminator's strongest qualities is the fact that it is paced perfectly. Just like every action film, there are breaks in between the action scenes, which presents the danger that the movie will drag. But Cameron times these scenes perfectly so that it never feels like the movie is dragging. All of the action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat rooting for the good guys. The excitement never lets up! <br/><br/>Cheesy love stories are usually a weakness in action films; fortunately, The Terminator's love story is actually very touching. <br/><br/>I have to praise the special effects. Sure they aren't impressive by today's standards, but when you consider the fact that this movie was made on a six million dollar budget, it is amazing they turned out so well. Stan Winston is truly a genius. As for the sound, I recommend the original mono track as opposed to the new sound on the DVD. IMO, the guns sound muted with the DVD's sound FX. <br/><br/>Of course this isn't a perfect movie. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are not exactly the best actors in the world, but to Hamilton's credit she improved in T2. But this is only a minor criticism. The Terminator is a must-see for every action fan."

Linda Hamilton plays the mother of John Connor-future hero off the earth.Arni has been sent to earth to kill her. The resistance is aware of this fact and sent back to the year 1984 a man to protect Sarah Connor(Linda H.)-Michael Biehn. He is a normal human while Arni is a machine and much more powerful. By the way: they sent these machines back to the future in the year 2029. So M.Biehn falls in love with Sarah and so becomes the father of John. In a final battle Arni and Michael both die. The remains of the Terminator are shown in T-2 ....well this movie is just a great one!!...you must see it. And includes one of 6 great scenes in movies of all times....I am talking about the part when Arnie says: I'll be back..

"jameskinsman","9","1","2","15 December 2005"," Ever Increasing in significance
","The Terminator, now over 20 years old, is a genre defining film that combines elements of noir film making with science fiction and action genres. It started off a whole movement in special effects and stunt orientated films, taking the hero against villain notion to a whole new level. Can you think of a film villain quite so iconic as the terminator? Often dismissed by many as a simple action movie responsible for launching Arnold Schwarzeneggers career, The Terminator has a message that is becoming more significant as we venture further into the 21st century.<br/><br/>Since the creation of planet earth, time has seen the inception of ever increasing forms of intelligent life. The principle of the natural selection and the very nature of existence, is that evolution progresses though natural processes of refining, developing and enhancing. Humans have for centuries been the dominant, most intelligent species on earth. As we continually create and innovate, probing technological possibilities, we are weakening the significance and purpose of natural selection and are playing the role of god increasingly. Computers become more advanced every year and scientists endeavour to pioneer methods in cloning and designer babies. Are we pushing too far, or are we simply approaching a new age of evolutionary development? Whatever our destiny, the line distinguishing computers and A.I, and possibly more importantly, humans and computers is becoming increasingly blurred. If we are indeed heading towards the creation of artificial intelligence, is the dark and apocalyptic vision created by Cameron just a nightmare, or does it present a possible future? A question as frightening as the looming Terminator in the movie.<br/><br/>The Terminator I believe, is one of cinemas modern classics and in 20 years time will be admired and revered as one of the great films of the 20th century. Not only does it have a powerful message, forcing us to ask questions about our increasing dependence on machines, but it also influenced a whole load of films in the late 80's, 90's and into the millennium."

This movie made him! and he in turn made this movie...he is and always will be The Terminator. Many forget that this original classic sci-fi action story he is NOT the hero. The Terminator is a deadly machine assassin sent into the past to destroy the mother of the man who will ultimately bring the machines to their end many years in the future. Schwarzenegger is deadly and brilliant, and robotic and downright evil. You can't help but be scared to death of this guy and that's awesome!! He doesn't have a lot of lines but he does the whole role with his motions and his reactions to things which makes for a pretty good actor I think.<br/><br/>James Cameron who wrote and directed the film created one of the world's best sci fi stories. This film which takes place entirely in 1984 gives you such an in depth look at a world far beyond their current time. It's a world where a deadly war has practically wiped out the human race and now they are taking the battle through time in order to win it. Even in a brief flashback we are treated to a glimpse into the world that can only be described as pure hell. Throughout this entire film one woman is being brutally stalked by this beast of a robot and only one man from the future stands between them. Michael Biehn plays Kyle Reese with great intensity and a believability that he is indeed a soldier from the future. Despite the fact that it seems this Termintor is deadly and unstoppable, this man, this soldier is a worthy adversary. Linda Hamilton in her infamous role as Sarah Conner, the future mother of the man who will save humanity unless The Terminator can destroy her first. She seems like a such a quiet innocent person but as the movie progresses we see her character become stronger, faster, and just a worth adversary herself. She's not gonna die without a fight and she's not going to let this newfound knowledge of a bleak future ruin her. Biehn and Hamilton have awesome chemistry and you believe their relationship from the very beginning. <br/><br/>The Terminator is the exact definition of non-stop action. It's constant, leaving you on the edge of your seat. Everyone's performance in the film is awesome and very watchable and you root for all of them. Best of all Schwarzenegger is an unbelievable machine that makes for one of film histories best bad guys. The film is gritty and very real, gory, bloody, no holds barred and without a doubt one of the best action films ever created. James Cameron created something unstoppable with this franchise. Everyone has to see The Termintor, it's just a must see movie and you won't be disappointed by what it has to offer!!! There is so much more to it than just your average action flick. 9/10"

","Terminator is one of those films that demands a multitude of repeat screenings. The storyline is genuinely interesting, a cyborg from the future (Arnie) having been sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor. Sent back to fight the cyborg is Michael Biehn. There are numerous brilliant moments in Terminator, but undoubtedly the film's finest hour comes when Arnie crashes a car into a police station before unleashing his machine guns mercilessly on the entire police force! There is so much shooting that even the most devoted of action fans will not be left wanting. Possibly Arnie's most famous one-liner makes its debut before the police station attack, 'I'll be back' being delivered with acres of Austrian menace! There are a few slow moments in the film, particularly the scenes where we are introduced to Sarah Connor, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for these few minutes of dullness. The sequels are not as good as the original, this film having been made in the mid 80s before the ultra-sanctimonious censor brigade got their hands on Hollywood. Too many films promise raw violence and don't deliver, Terminator does. Well worth buying."

","There are classics and then there are classics. The Terminator has become a phenomenon, an embodiment of a ruthless killer and certainly the best robot murdering device from the future I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Sarah Conner is understandably upset to learn that a killer cyborg from the future has been sent back to the past (which WAS the present...I think) to kill her so she cannot give birth to the future leader of man against machine. But help is at hand in the form of Kyle Reese, a soldier also sent back to protect her from the terminator.<br/><br/>Thinking about it could make your head spin and it probably wont win many awards with Steven Hawkings but as an action film it delivers the goods. Arnold in his best ever role as an unthinking, unfeeling machine - just like in real life - is superb. It was the role he was artificially created to play. He wastes humans with reckless abandon, including a scene where he wipes out an entire police station to get to Connor. A scene so good it was even referenced in the second film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a huge contributer to the mood of the film and it's the darkest of the three Terminator flicks. Even if the formula was perfected in T2 : Judgement Day the first is still a cinema classic. It will make you paranoid towards all form of machinery for weeks to the extent you'll want to live in the woods in a house made from stones and parts of animals.

This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the silent killing machine known to man as The Terminator (T-800 Model 101) and is sent into time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)to prevent the birth of her son, future leader resistence John Connor. A future soldier by the name of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent to 1984, to intercept The Terminator  before it kills Sarah. The acting in this film is memorable, Arnold is perfect as The Terminator with absoutely no emotion of killing people. Biehn is great as Reese a soldier who is bound by duty and honor but never has experienced Love in his life which he will receive later on and is potrayl is so real you can not help but feel sorry for him. Hamilton does a wonderful potrayl as Sarah Connor the victim of all this who can't believe that she will be the mother for the future and is scared about what happens when she has this child. Other supporting Actors are good including Paul Winfield and the late Lance Henriksen a Cameron favorite. This is proberly James Cameron's greatest achievement in 1984 whenever he made this movie he wrote and directed, along with his former wife producer Gale Anne Hurd. The Visual Effects in today's standards are not up to par but however still they are bot bad for a movie made in 1984 and besides Orion Pictures Studio only gave him a 6.4 millon dollar budget to work nothing much i would say. However the makeup designs and creations by Stan Winston are still excellent to this day he remains one of the best Creature designs ever (Endoskeleton for example remains the best work in 1984). The Terminator serves as a great art for filmmaking it inspires filmmakers to make what you have. Regular scale: 4.5/5; 1-10 Scale: 9.5/10.

Personally, I'm not sure why everyone prefers the sequel to this, but I couldn't even tolerate T2 due to the way they played it for cheap laughs and Schwarzenegger got to play the good guy, which doesn't make a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Biehn plays the part of the lone protector just as he should: desperate and unsure of himself, but with enough focus on his mission that he'll try as hard as he can to protect Sarah. Schwarzenegger plays the killing machine as a cold and unfeeling thing, unconcerned with anything at all except its end goal. Hamilton is great as an everywoman who has to muster more than she thinks she has just to survive and to deal with what she's told is coming ahead.<br/><br/>The only missteps were the relationship between Reese and Connor, as I thought this seemed out of place tonally and turned the movie into a different direction than it should have been going. Luckily, that's a small part of the movie and can easily be overlooked by how great the rest of it really is.<br/><br/>I'm not an action movie fan, but Cameron is right on target here and made me a believer.

"Silverzero","10","1","2","5 October 2002"," Visceral, violent sci-fi thriller which defines the 1980's.
","For me, the thing that stood most from this film was the foggy atmosphere and far out-dated, cheesy music. Yes, I did like this, very much so but it does have its flaws.<br/><br/>The films visual effects were outstanding for their time but the quality is poor, compared to todays standards. Thank God there's not much of it. But despite this poor CGI the films atmosphere and visuals are excellent. The movies typically foggy, 80's visuals go surprisingly well and add to the films overall effect. The neon lights and glamour also contribute.<br/><br/>Unfortunately not much can be said for the acting. Arnold Scharzanegger does have good acting abilities (as proved in End of Days). But with only 16 lines he does come a little ""short"". Michael Biehn isn't much better and doesn't come across well trying to be an action hero,(what sort of name is Kyle Reese). Linda Hamilton is good, nuff' said.<br/><br/>The Terminator will always be remembered as a classic. In my opinion its better than then the sequel. Lets face it, without Terminator there would be no Terminator 2. It may be somewhat ironic (why would people from 2029 have mullets?), but it does have its moments. Overall, excellent 8.2 out of 10."

"ColeSear","8","1","2","14 August 2002"," Provocative though imperfect (Spoilers)
","This was the first time I had seen the original Terminator. While now it seems like it's going to be logistical nightmare it is definitely a film that leaves itself open for a sequel and eventually a third film.<br/><br/>	We open with a very 80s fantasy set with spaceships flying shooting lasers at each other and then this huge tank steamrolling over skulls. The background is all blue with nothing distinguishing that it's the sky at all.<br/><br/>	We then get a title insert giving us some back-story and/or fore-story telling us of the battle that lead to the world's destroyed state in 2028 and how in the present the true battle will be fought. It was truly a challenge to remember that much such that I could write it down because I hate any of those inserts at the beginning unless their purpose is comedic. I feel that when you're dealing with a visual medium and you have a lot of writing on the screen at the beginning you shouldn't expect anyone to remember it, the exception being those people who went to see Star Wars 55 times as compared to my zero. 	For the first forty minutes of the film it seems as if we're watching two characters making identical moves and are left to wonder if the script was written as half a script copied over with only the names being changed. However, slowly we find out that the Schwarzenegger character is the Terminator and the other person, Reese, who traveled through time, which is also very clouded at the beginning, are working in opposite purposes. 	What was set up by Cameron and Hurd in the beginning is a very interesting misinterpretation of facts. We see the police one deputy played by Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead) and the chief who just happens to be African-American (but I'll address that later) about two Sarah Connor's who had been killed. We also witness our main Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) see the TV news bulletin about the first murder which her friends find humorous and see her stunned reaction to the second and see her sitting around in fear this section was probably the best part of her inconsistent performance. 	As a director Cameron didn't seem to be very interested in creating too many intricate frames. There were a few shown during the war scenes where there was a lot of wreckage used as an obstruction and there was also some good framing in the parking garage with the use of wide angle shots. The focus seemed to be on lighting and using the color blue. There are scenes were everything is tinted blue. There also was a lot of use of floodlighting along with mist, fog, smoke and any effect of that sort they could find. This left the color palate was very muted and this lent itself to the somber tone that Cameron was attempting to create in the chases and stalking scenes also when Reese and Sarah were under the bridge for the night.<br/><br/>	Story wise, however, there are some very good foreshadowing touches added. One being a waitress friend of Sarah's saying ""In a hundred years who's gonna care."" Where the essence of this film is examining how through time travel these people are attempting to secure the future both looking for drastically different results. Before Sarah ever sees Reese one of her friends is wearing a Jetson's shirt, small yes but any number of shirts could have been chosen and the filmmakers decided to drop some hints. 	Character-wise there is but one character who is worth talking about and that is the Terminator. Schwarzenegger's character is one who is symbolic of what humanity would become of we became overly dependent on computers/machines in that the Terminator itself is a machine with flesh. The Terminator is a film that was released in 1984 the year of Orwell's famous novel took place in and it was also a year where computer was still very new and misunderstood and the concept of Big Brother was still very alive. We see Reese has been branded with a bar code which seems to be both an attack on consumerism and Nazism by combining them in one symbol. While this is not the larger issue that the film deals with it most definitely should be a fact that no Science-Fiction film avoids social commentary in some way. 	The greatest accomplishment of this film is the way in which the Polaroid photograph was introduced in the end. It was an image haunting the story and it seemed to be the one piece of evidence that would prove the veracity of the whole plot to all those involved as if we weren't already willing to believe. The great failure of the film, however, is that Reese is the father of John Connor which was very predictable after they started talking on a more personal level. His death in 1984 makes up for it a bit but it doesn't take away the fact that I had that little voice nagging in the back of my head saying ""Don't be John's father! Don't be John's father! Don't be John's father!"" In the end Sarah Conner we sympathize with and she does end up being well drawn out even though when she got 'tough' her dialogue seemed forced and I think Cameron should have re-written the line to make it more believable. The only real problem with characters I had were the African-American characters who all had either walk throughs or supporting roles and seemed to be taken from the text How to Write a Stereotype. All in all The Terminator is a very intriguing and provocative science-fiction film."
"keenenpieter","Null","1","2","18 July 2002"," Very Original
","The first time I saw this movie, I was 7 or 8 years old, a little too young to see a movie like that. Well, if a child saw a movie, it's automatically scarier, because a kid can't see immediately if it's real or not. I'm now 16, when I saw this movie 8 years ago, it was a very scary movie, and actually it still is scary after all those years. So that can only mean one thing: It's a great movie, and it is. If I compare it with its sequel, this movie has a darker and moodier atmosphere, and it's more original than T2.. If you have seen both movies, you can see that T2 inherited a lot of its original. And Arnie as the bad guy (excellent performance by Arnie), that was the best thing, he carries the whole movie by himself, no one else could do this role better than Arnold, because he was just perfect. He doesn't have to say a lot, but that's one of the most effective points of its character. Other points is his cold-blooded appearance, just ice-cold and no emotions at all. Great job, Arnie!!<br/><br/>James Cameron has made an excellent sci-fi movie, with a very original story, a good cast and good special effects for a movie out of 1984. He really keeps the suspense in it, it never goes away, because you never know when The Terminator will strike again. With the story I have to say that it really opens your mind for the future, because what happens in that future, COULD happen in real life(So watch out for every machine in your house, you never know). Did you know that this movie had a budget for only 6$ million. James Cameron really showed me what you can do with a small budget like that, he made one of the scariest movies and one of the best sci-fi movies ever. A real classic and its sequel too, so my advice is: rent both movies or buy them, either suits me. But definitely see it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Angry_Arguer","10","1","2","9 July 2002"," Help saved sci-fi from Star Wars (spoilers)
","Terminator deserves an award for the impact it made to sci-fi--albeit good and bad.  Star Wars demolished the genre that Kubrick slaved to change, making space operas more important than thinking at the box office.  With Terminator we abandon droids, galactic empires, the Force, and all that other pissant elementary school dung and get down to business, pronto. Many films are hailed ""cool"", but intellectuals get their brains working and reject is as garbage.  Terminator is one movie that'll please both smart & stupid, the darkness gives the sense of evil everywhere while an electronic score enhances the feeling of man at the mercy of machines.  Arnold, limited actor he is, reigns king of deadpan brutality.  When he puts a shotgun shell in someone's chest or rips their heart out--he doesn't smile, frown, or flinch, his performance is robotic--AND IT WORKS! The nightmarish future scenes make Mad Max look like Teletubbies (interesting how many set pieces were reused in T2).  While the futuristic Hunter-Killers seem fake, their machined ruthlessness causes fear. The cyborgs slay like Judas, betraying our emotions into believing only what's human, then whipping out the laser cannon and perforating us. As in almost all his work, James Cameron has women become strong.  Little is spent worrying with that and more on the story--making it one of the best low budget movies that does a lot with little.  In a 150 MILLION dollar film, do they care where the cash goes?  No, and we spectators wind up with ""Wild Wild West"", ""Pearl Harbor"", and ""Waterworld"" (not bold moves for the studios)!  In a $6 million film like this, togetherness is key. WARNING!  DON'T CONTEMPLATE HOW TELEPORTING IN TIME TO CHANGE THE PAST IN ORDER TO SAVE THE FUTURE WORKS!!  You'll go cuckoo and wind up in an insane asylum."

This is, of course, the one that made him a big star.<br/><br/>Likewise, it put James Cameron on the map, representing a fresh start after the universally despised ""Piranha 2"", which is, as of this writing, unseen by me, and likely to remain that way for  a long time, which is probably for the best.<br/><br/>It's interesting to notice that ""Terminator"" cost only $6.4 million, yet Cameron wound up making the most expensive movie ever made-you know what I'm talking about!

","I'm an action film buff, and since a lot of things have blown up since 1984, you'd think that ""The Terminator"", like ""48 Hrs"", would now be a little dated. No.<br/><br/>The Terminator takes an interesting science fiction premise and takes it to intelligent, deep heights. While the film won't exactly change your life (""Contact"", ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Smoke Signals""), it's a fast-paced trip with wonderful realism.<br/><br/>The plot is incredibly tight (like ""Memento"" and ""Back to the Future""). Every second counts and each character in the film is always doing something that's in character and meaningful. You can also view the film as a pure action film, but there's a lot of depth here. Notice, for example, that The Terminator is always running -- that's how a machine gets its most efficient movement. The acting is terrific, especially by Linda Hamilton, and the story is sort-of really about her character (the ""everyman"") rises to the challenge.<br/><br/>Buoyed even more by its classic sequel, ""The Terminator"" is sure to endure and is the best SF film on the 1980s.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- SF fans: a must-see, but it's too scary for young kids<br/><br/>-- action film fans: a must-see, even if you don't like Arnold<br/><br/>-- drama film fans who like to go slumming once in a while.<br/><br/>This film is quite intelligent and I suggest you try it.<br/><br/>I'll give ""The Terminator"" a 10 out of 10."

"Jerique","1","15","112","30 October 2007"," Cameron's worst movie? Perhaps.
","Terminator is relatively slow for the first 20 minutes. We are quickly introduced to Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She seems like a nobody (which she pretty much is for the most part - aside from birthing her son).<br/><br/>The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) searches for her since there seems to be quite a few of Sarah Connor's. After finally finding the correct one, he goes on the chase and Sarah tries to hide figuring that she could be killed if found.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) shows up from the future. He explains the Terminator is also from the future and is a cybernetic organism. He explains that Sarah's not-born-yet son John Connor is the leader of the rebel army to face the machines. Sarah and Kyle fall in love, somehow, quickly and show it by having sex. Sarah gets pregnant and survives the Terminator attack (this really isn't a spoiler since there is two sequels).<br/><br/>Now, at this point you are probably wondering why I titled it as I did. Sure, it sounds interesting. But, Back To The Future makes sense. This is just ridiculous. A guy comes from the future and has a kid with a woman. Think about it. Doesn't that sound over the top? It will continue to happen the same way, thats how time traveling works.<br/><br/>The story, however, is not the worst part of the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger says nearly zero lines. The make-up effects were just dreadful and then you have the special effects. I think for the most part the special effects were dormant. 1977, we saw some amazing special and visual effects from Star Wars. Seven years later, this trash comes out.<br/><br/>It was tolerable up till the last 20 minutes. The skeleton was shown and instead of looking scary and realistic, it looked like stop frame animation from Nightmare Before Christmas. I laughed when I first saw this and I was thinking to myself: 'Linda must have hated this part.' It's like running away from air, and screaming at nothing. Must have been difficult to portray. The sequel definitely beats the original by a long shot. The good news about this movie is: James Cameron's career was not ruined by it, thankfully. Titanic, Terminator II, and Aliens all kept it alive.<br/><br/>If you are a die-hard Terminator fan or Arnold fan, you'll watch this just for the fact of watching it. But if you're any fraction like me, you won't enjoy it and it will probably never grace your DVD/VCR ever again - unless you have a Terminator marathon."

But Arnold Schwarzenegger found his niche here, playing a villain without a heart, an expressionless and bloodthirsty machine, and it's easy to see why this transformed his career: he's a natural at playing the bad guy(which is why ""Terminator 2"" was such a disappointment, it tried to reconfigure the odds back in Arnold's favor). Linda Hamilton is also terrific as a waitress whom Arnold wants dead.

","Terminator, The (1984) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Everyone knows the story to this action classic so there's no point in going over it again but you really can't blame any of the stories you've heard about how hard it was for Cameron to get this made. It's quite well known that this movie barely got made and if you hear the story you might see why a producer or studio might pass on making it. There's no doubt in my mind that in lesser hands this film would have turned out to be a disaster but Cameron really makes it what it is. The fact that he found someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger to play the killing Terminator is never a bad thing but Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn also fill their roles quite nicely. What works best for the film is its dark tone, which Cameron never comes away from. Even the ""softer"" moments of the film, those inside the motel between Hamilton and Biehn's characters, are quite dark and the overall tone and atmosphere is what really makes it stand out. There are numerous great moments but the highlight has to be the scene where the Terminator does an operation on itself. The police station massacre has always been an uneasy scene to watch but that's a good thing. The movie has non-stop action from start to finish and you throw in the fine performances and that makes this a classic for the genre. The special effects are top notch as is the score so there's no doubt that this film deserves its reputation."
"one-nine-eighty","10","1","3","12 February 2020"," An absolute game changer for Sci-Fi action
","This is an absolute classic and it's a film that not only started a franchise, but spawned a concept that's spilled into all areas of modern cultural entertainment, let alone other movies.<br/><br/>In the future, machines are the dominant force on earth. Human kind has practically been wiped out, all apart from small cells of freedom fighters and rebels, who all follow the lead of John Connor - an almost prophetic guerrilla leader who's standing up to the machines. To change the course of the human/ machine war, an assassin robot is sent back in time to kill the unborn leader's mother before he can be born and have any impact on the war. In order to counter this, and make sure that John Connor is born, a freedom fighter is also sent back in time, to stop the assassin robot. This is where things get tricky, certain actions from either machine or man could detrimentally affect the future and have a butterfly effect on the way things turn out - the future may not end up being the future while the past is in flux. Does that make sense?? (I tried explaining this to a friend in the early 90's and it just garnered blank expressions!).<br/><br/>I'll start by saying that cast in this film is absolutely brilliant, everyone delivers a top class performance, for some people this film elevated them to superstar status allowing them to choose better movies that they may have previously had. The standout star in this film is undoubtedly Arnold Schwarzenegger. While he only had a few lines in the film that's all he actually needed as his mannerisms and demeanour are enough to portray brick-wall dominance and violence. It's probably fair to say that had he been given more lines, then this film may have been slightly spoiled, his English accent at the time wasn't brilliant, and the use of little dialogue lends well to portraying an emotionless machine intent on bringing death. Props also need to go to Michael Biehn, who acts as the story teller and the vehicle for the films pace, he's the freedom fighter sent from the future to protect Linda Hamilton's character, who is going to be the mother of the human resistance. A lot of people really got their big break here, from Arnie, to Biehn, Hamilton, even the likes of Bill Paxton and Lance Henrikson - some of who, carried on their relationship with directory Cameron in other movies.<br/><br/>The look and feel of the film, the cinematography is splendid. Mainly filmed at night or in dark locations, set in urban areas, this really films like a dark and moody film. There are flashbacks (or flash forwards as it's from the future), that juxtapose the urban landscape with the warzone future that's yet to come. The CGI and special effects in the film are fantastic, while they look slightly dated now in places, at the time these were revolutionary and haunting. James Cameron does a brilliant job knitting together a great story with a top cast, great effects and fantastic visuals. Breaking the mould and making Sci-Fi bigger and better than ever, bringing the future to your current existence (while previous sci-fi classics have usually looked at being in the future already, or even space exploration) this almost smart but lethal, almost Orwellian, action chase film is an absolute masterpiece, and it's easy to see why, despite being low budget, it broke so many records and conventions - and spawned sequels, prequels, comics, TV series, as well as inspiring other parts of modern entertainment. Easily one of my favourite films of all time 10 out of 10."

That's correct. The T-800 is programmed kill Sarah Conner....not John Conner. Why, you ask? It's simple, go after the mother, that way, there's no evidence that John Conner ever existed. It's a no risk policy the machines obey by. Don't worry, there may be hope.

","What makes The Terminator work so well is the simplicity of its story, which is told so effectively. It has a straightforward and engaging narrative that is easy to follow for the audience. Given the fact that this is a science fiction story that deals with time travel, credit must be given to the well-written script from James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd.<br/><br/>The main cast in this movie does a great job and bring their characters to life. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a terrific performance as the titular character, creating one of cinemas most iconic villains. His complete lack of reasoning or empathy makes him terrifying. Michael Biehn is very likeable in the role of Kyle Reese and gives it his all, while Linda Hamilton is solid in the role of Sarah Connor. Paul Winfield and Lance Hendrickson are also memorable in their small parts as a lieutenant and detective, respectively.<br/><br/>The movie includes some fantastic action sequences, including a shootout in a police station and most notably, a sequence which takes place in the Tech Noir nightclub, where the tension soars to fantastic heights. The action throughout the movie is gripping and violent with Brad Feidal's iconic score taking them to the next level. Feidal's music is epic and emotional when it needs to be while also evoking a sense of dread whenever the T-800 is on screen.<br/><br/>Despite its low budget, the film does a good job with the special effects, in particular, the few scenes that are set in the future. The T-800's prosthetic arm and the cyborg skeleton design are also magnificent. Some effects haven't dated as well as others, however. An animatronic head is used in a small number of scenes after the T-800 injures his eye, which never looks convincing and takes the viewer out of the movie.<br/><br/>The final action sequence in the factory doesn't have the same edge of your seat excitement as the rest of the film. This is down to the use of stop motion effects which feel jarring compared to the gritty, realistic style of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The weakest element of the film is the love story between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. It never feels convincing or believable, given that the characters have only known each other for a single day. The sex scene between the two characters is also incredibly awkward, with the camerawork and editing making it feel like an 80's music video.<br/><br/>Overall, The Terminator is a great, fast-paced action movie. It put James Cameron on the map and gave Arnie his career-defining role. While it isn't perfect, it's essential viewing for fans of science fiction cinema."

","Image a year were super computers dominate the world. It is a post-apocalyptic 2029 Los Angeles. In 1997 a nuclear war broke out, killing most. Those remaining formed a resistance against these super computers/terminators. It's a dark future were humans have to be careful, one mistake could be their last. The resistance mostly do their movement at night. They still have to be careful because terminators blend in and the also use infrared to see. Most keep dogs, because they have the ability to warn if a terminator is close or has infiltrated their camp. These supercomputers have the ability to alter the future by sending a terminator back in time to target someone who might be a threat in the future. A Terminator has one mission search and destroy. The resistance also has a plan to protect the target, one volunteers to go, Kyle Reese( Micheal Biehn) he is aware no one comes back from this dangerous mission.<br/><br/>We go to present day Los Angeles, 1984. It is a warm night and two electrical disturbances come out thin air. They are in 2 different places, one is the human resistance member, Kyle Reese. The other is the T- 100, the terminator sent to find Sarah Connor ( Linda Hamilton). Reese will do everything he can to protect Sarah from the terminator, but first he needs to find him. Sarah is nervous, because to other women with that name were killed earlier in the day, and according to the phone book she is the next in line. When Sarah's date cancels she notices Reese following her. She enters a dance club and phones the cops, they tell her to say there, because it is a public area. When she notices Reese enter she gets scared and ducts under the table. When the T-100 arrives and notices her, he pulls a gun. It's not until the last minute Reese spots him, and rescues Sarah. He tells her who he is, and what is after her. A Terminator that looks human, but has her marked for termination. She thinks he's crazy, until he explains more about his past; and why he's here. They develop a friendship and wants to know more. He tells her in the near future she will become the mother of a top resistance leader, John Connor. At first she 's upset, she doesn't want this so called honor. As each day goes by, their relationship grows, she knows Reese will keep her safe. One day they get caught by the cops and both are taken in. The cops, plus a psychologist think Reese is crazy; and Sarah wonders too. Later that night the T-100 finds them at the police station. There is a massive gunfight, but Reese and Sarah are able to escape. The two escape, but need to lay low for awhile. They find a motel buy bomb making supplies for pipe bombs & have a very intimate night. Eventually, with the materials they made Sarah is able to destroy the terminator by crushing it in a steel press, but Reese perishes. Near the end, Sarah is preparing for the storm that is headed. She is in a Jeep, has a dog by her side, and John Connor will soon be born. This is one of my favorites, it has a lot of action, the plot is excellent, and the cast ROX. This film will make you wonder, will machines eventually take over our future?"

","Before being a master of great CGI movies like Avatar (2009), Titanic (1997), James Cameron directed and produced this, Terminator (1984), and it had become one of his greatest work. There was so much sci-fi and action that we have always wanted to see. It was about a seemingly indestructible android is sent from 2029 to 1984 to assassinate a waitress, whose unborn son will lead humanity in a war against the machines, while a soldier from that war is sent to protect her at all costs.<br/><br/>Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (a name that is hard to pronounce), as T-800. Most of you though that in the movie he would be a protagonist but he was actually the main villain. It was weird right because the poster had his portrait on it, not a hero but a villain. Schwarzenegger was legendary when he took this role and he acted just like a real cyborg with no feelings, no tears, it's just so perfect! Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, T-800's only target, was good as well being a waitress, a person who didn't know how her son was going to be. Michael Biehn played the good guy Kyle Reese, who would then be Sarah Connor's husband but he died before they even got married. Pretty sad! At first I thought he was another terminator which he had no clothes as well as T-800. It was funny when we could see T-800's buttocks. But then, the best performance belongs to the villain and that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was great and perfect for the movie! A great casting choice!<br/><br/>I liked the action sequence so much because they were non-stop, entertaining and well-edited, 1% of bad CGI. I just didn't like the cinematography much. It really looked like the 60s with technicolor or the 70s. The 80s were a bit of advanced so they should spend more of the budget to make a better cinematography. It's really hard to look at something that should be seen clearly. Another problem was when T-800 chased the two when it was burnt and exploded by one of Reese's bombs and turned into a cyborg skeleton, it was walking like how villains walk from movies of the 20s, the 30s or the 40s. It was bad. The lines from the screenplay were really good and iconic, especially: I'll be back! Or Fak you assholr! I really wanted to say it in front of bullies who tried to do the same thing that made the character says the line. They would be like ""Where do you get that line from?"" and they would get jealous.<br/><br/>Terminator (1984) was a masterpiece of sci-fi and action. I was still confused why it was R-Rated. There wasn't much blood or restricted danger. I felt it should be PG-13 because teens under 18 loved it as well. I really disagreed with the fact that it was rated an R. It was such a waste of that rating. For sci-fi and action movie fans, you guys should see it. It's one of the greatest in science fiction.<br/><br/>Ratings: 8.8/10"

","A time travel twist, a garish synth soundtrack, and a (literally) robotic Arnold with one-liners galore (see his choice from the ""possible responses"" to the cleaner) add just the right amount of retro-futuristic flair to an easily engaging chase-thriller. The special effects are pretty dated (see the stop motion robot; fake horizon at the end) but that doesn't mean the climactic fight isn't great or the open-ended epilogue isn't supremely satisfying (""...there's a storm coming in"" ""I know"").

","The Terminator: 10 out of 10: Time travel meets a future dystopia meets eighties hair in one of the best B-movies ever made. Considering this was directed by a guy whose only film at the time was Piranha 2 the Spawning.it seems like a miracle.<br/><br/>The Good: Repeat viewings will clue one in on a couple of things. For starters, this is a tightly made film with great pacing and foreshadowing. Little things (Arnie running over a toy truck in one of the first scenes as an example call back to themes and scenes later in the film.) The film is so well paced that when it turns it up to eleven (Police station natch) the surprise in genuine and in-universe.<br/><br/>There is also a surprisingly successful time travel romance film. It handles the conundrum of time travel much better than many films for whom time travel is their raison d'Ãªtre. Despite some occasionally clunky dialogue, the romance between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn really works. One can imagine that film sans the whole end of the world unstoppable Terminator part. (As an aside Gene Siskel in his review of the movie said as much wishing they had dumped the Arnie character and concentrated on these two kids. Roger Ebert for the record disagreed).<br/><br/>The Bad: Okay I love practical effects. You love practical effects. Let us be honest the Terminator in the first film goes a little skeleton from that Sinbad movie at the end. In addition, Arnie's mask/makeup when he is fixing his face makes him look a little too much like Michael Myers.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Like Jaws and Die Hard, Terminator has spun off some subpar sequels and a ton of god awful ripoffs. Some of the original OMG factor is invariably lost with the familiarity of the plot and the sea of pretenders.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: There is a scene early on in that wonderful eighties bar Tech Noir Where Linda Hamilton finally gets hold of the police and they tell her don't worry, stay in the crowd, and we have someone on the way. You will be safe. When I first watched the film I really believed that. The film kept selling me safety only to pull the rug out from under again and again. I have seen few films who have played that parlor trick any better. Not a cheap trick of the killer pretending to be dead but a real one of a truly relentless machine After all as Michael Biehn says ""That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!"" The sequels have lessened that message and blurred those lines. This film gets to the heart of it. It is an action film, a romance, a sci-fi thriller, but most of all it is a horror film about something that can't be stopped and where you are never truly safe. A great movie."

","Nothing to add to the positive reviews. However, during my early attempts to write screenplays, this was a film I played on repeat (often in the background) as one to study. I believe it is worth the same exploration for any brewing screenwriter."
"mhorg2018","10","1","3","15 June 2018"," Low Budget means nothing.
","Before James Cameron's ego ran rampant, this was one of the great films (the other being Aliens) that he made. A simple story of time travel, with a soldier and a killing machine from the future, coming back to accomplish disparate tasks: the soldier to save, the machine to kill, the mother of the futures savior. A brilliant film, sparse and quick, it keeps the viewer glued to the screen and again, in the pre CGI days, the limited amount of effects are simply amazing. The movie that set Arnold on his career path, and made Cameron one to be noticed. Just great."

","The first Terminator could almost be like a horror movie of sorts, this unstoppable and relentless robotic killer is after a young woman.. it also has a darker mood than any of the sequels.

"Bored_Dragon","8","1","3","19 May 2018"," Legendary ""I'll be back"" spoken for the very first time

After the war, survivors, led by John Connor, are in the war against machines and they are winning. Machines send cyborg to the past to kill Connor's mother and prevent his birth. Humans send Kyle Reese to save her. The rest is history.<br/><br/>From today's perspective, this action SF is still good, but largely out-dated. Subjectively, I would rate it six out of ten. But when you take into account that it was filmed in 1984, that it had a serious impact on the genre and career of several actors, as well as anti-nuclear message and warning that technology develops faster than our ability to manage it safely, the rating must go up.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>I would like to add another observation. If the film was exactly the same as it is, with the only difference that Terminator was not a robot but a ghost or a demon or something like that, it would probably be classified as a horror. This movie has all the elements of '80s horrors, and the only difference that distinguishes it from them is the quasi-scientific premise."

There are also great Mike Biehn (regular in Cameron's films), Linda Hamilton (this was his 6th film), Lance Henriksen (""Aliens""' robot Bishop) and Paul Winfield (the judge in ""Presumed Innocent"").<br/><br/>An unknown Bill Paxton plays a small role as the Punk leader who dies at the hands of the T-800. This was his first collaboration with Jim Cameron, later he would make 4 more films with him.<br/><br/>Also noteworthy are the special effects of Stan Winston and Gene Warren of Fantasy II, especially the endoskeleton (the Terminator without skin). The movie would have lost a lot if it had not shown the endoskeleton, it was the final surprise that Cameron had prepared.<br/><br/>It was obvious that the Terminator had to be shown without the living tissue, since the great majority of the public was very curious and hoped to see what was inside Schwarzenegger, especially when one sees the ""operation"" of the eye and arm, the public I knew Arnold had ""something"" and wanted to see it.<br/><br/>Also noteworthy are the excellent soundtrack of Brad Friedel, as well as some eighties songs from TryangleZ (""Photoplay"" or ""Burnin' in the Third Degree"") or Lin Van Hek (""Intimacy"").<br/><br/>The movie is very, very entertaining from beginning to end, an undisputed masterpiece of science fiction that must be seen (if not 100, 100,000 times) before dying.<br/><br/>It followed an excellent continuation (T2: judgment day) with a less convincing Terminator, but with some incredible special effects and the ridiculous Terminator 3: rise of the machines, with an aging Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Terminator is UNIQUE.<br/><br/>I thank God that I am alive so I can see this movie again.

"eskwarczynski","8","1","3","21 March 2016"," The effects may be dated, but the story is timeless.
","Although this film has been almost completely overshadowed by it's vastly superior and instantly classic sequel, Terminator deserves a place among the greatest sci-fi action films of all time. What James Cameron was able to accomplish with a measly six million dollar budget is absolutely incredible. <br/><br/>The style of the film is easily comparable to Halloween, the horror classic which released six years earlier. An unstoppable antagonist chasing down an initially weak protagonist. This game of cat and mouse is thrilling, and would be perfected by Cameron in Terminator 2.<br/><br/>The film has some flaws, most typical of lower budget and independent fare. The score is primarily synthesizer sounds. Performances range from good to bad – Linda Hamilton certainly developed as an actress in a big way by her 1992 return to the franchise. Effects are a fifty/fifty between jaw-dropping and cringe-inducing, although it should be noted that Stan Winston's designs are incredible in every case.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a wonderful film with a few minor issues, and should be seen by anyone who considers themselves a fan of the genre."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","7","1","3","6 July 2015"," Great horror/ scifi, with a bit of intentional humour
","One of the most memorable introductions, with his phonetic, computer- like diction (rarely used) , a most relentless stalker/ killer begins his search, ominously looking over LA sprawling out in front of him, from a hilltop. <br/><br/>This apparent horror goes into science fiction territory, as we learn he is a machine sent from the future to kill a girl, and a man has also been sent to protect her at all costs.<br/><br/>The sci-fi and horror elements are balanced with enough intentional humour, specifically from the police, to whom she goes for protection when the carnage begins. Film wisely gives the audience time to catch their breath. But the police are not merely there for comic relief, they take their job completely serious; it is their interaction with each other which evokes laughter. Yet they still have no idea what they have to protect her from, and are hopelessly at a loss when confronted by it.<br/><br/>Calling, yet foreboding music score is a major asset. The metallic *ting* sound heard throughout the score give the film an industrial/ found object feel, which only compliments the film's tone. <br/><br/>Classic and influential; marred only by a dippy, out-of-place love story subplot, which comes from out of nowhere and makes no sense."
"OllieSuave-007","9","1","3","16 February 2015"," Interesting to see Arnold as the villain!
","This is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature movies, where he stars as a cyborg sent from 2029 to 1984 by the machines to assassinate waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) so she would not give birth do John Connor. John will eventually lead humanity against the machines in a nuclear war.<br/><br/>This is an exhilarating movie from start to finish, gaining steam right from the beginning when the Terminator appears almost immediately, wreaking havoc in the city, followed by the appearance of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who begins his mission to protect Sarah Connor. From the human chases to Arnold's catchy one-liners, and from the mysterious war to the explosions, this film has a suspenseful story by James Cameron, solid direction by James Cameron and an amazing, believable display of sci-fi effects by the Special and Visual Effects teams.<br/><br/>The dreary atmosphere of the war-torn world under the hands of the machines gives you an eerie feeling of what might happen in a futuristic world and the mysterious plot line/mission as described by Kyle Reese gives the film its dramatic and intriguing element. And, Biehn and Hamilton had some good on-screen chemistry and Schwarzenegger is hilarious with his one-liners and proves he is a destructive force to be reckon with; after seeing Arnold as the butt-kicking action hero in many films, it is interesting and almost out-of-this-world to see him play the villain! <br/><br/>The acting was good for the most part, though I thought Hamilton was a little too reserved at times. Brad Fiedel's music score needed a more mysterious and sci-fi feel, though I did like the Terminator theme, and some of the action scenes were a little overkill. But overall, this is a one of the most iconic films in cinema history and and is a must-see for any action and sci-fi movie fans.<br/><br/>Grade A-"

Like its title character, this movie is just relentless, always charging straight ahead and only pausing long enough for some well executed character development before setting off again.<br/><br/>The cast is so uniformly perfect that you can't even imagine anyone else in their roles. It was a star making turn for Arnold, and deservedly so, but Linda Hamilton, and particularly Michael Biehn, are also fantastic.<br/><br/>We all know that the entire premise--clever as it is, and as well as it's executed--doesn't hold up to much intellectual scrutiny, but in a movie populated by cyborgs and such, I'm willing to give in and just enjoy."

Especially good, I feel, was the making of the father of John Connor to be the time traveler and the picture in the end becoming the picture which was earlier on in the movie.

"Shantell_sabbar","7","1","3","8 October 2012"," James Cameron. An Auteur?
","When watching a James Cameron film if you didn't know he directed it, you wouldn't guess. He doesn't exactly have the complete directive control on all of his films. He doesn't stick to the same genre; although no matter what genre his film is there is always a strong aspect of love and it isn't always romance. There is however some similarities within the films he has directed. Firstly, he has a large budget when it comes to making the film. Identifying the budget; Aliens was around $18,500,000; Titanic at $200,000,000, and a more recent film being Avatar at $237,000,000. Two top box office films were also both made by James Cameron so he is making a huge profit on what he is putting into the film. It could be argued that James Cameron is an auteur when it comes to money in terms of the budget and the profits. Secondly, there is always an aspect of strong love within his films. In both The Terminator, and Aliens the human forms a relationship with the non-human species although that same species within each film is shown to be bad. In Terminator the viewer witnesses a strong love between the robot and the boy almost like a father and son relationship although the enemy is also a robot. In Aliens, although it is a horror and the aliens are the enemy there is a scene where Ripley has no choice but to kill the alien to survive but it is quite emotional as there is a bond between this alien and herself. In both of the above films the non-human species is shown to be good and bad. It changes with Avatar. A human and a Na'vi fall in love, and instead of one of the non-human species being the enemy, the human is. Which takes the film from another perspective but it still shows a strong love within this film. Although not as obvious as another director such as Tim Burton for example, James Cameron could still be perceived as an Auteur in the ways mentioned above."
"dunmore_ego","7","1","3","11 August 2009"," Rise of the Machine (i.e. Arnold).
","Arnold Schwarzenegger as a killing machine with no emotions, big guns belching, outlandish feats of body strength, delivering his lines in a sinister, robotic monotone - hang on, that could be any of his movies. But this movie made him what he is today. What, the Governor of California?...<br/><br/>When THE TERMINATOR was released in 1984, Schwarzenegger was already a superstar - 7 Mr. Olympia titles, five-time Mr. Universe, with the CONAN franchise under his belt) – this movie made him a million-dollar mega-star, a household name, an on screen icon.<br/><br/>In this James Cameron actioner, Schwarzenegger is the eponymous Terminator, a cyborg from the future (2029), sent back in time by the machines, to 1984 Los Angeles, to ""terminate"" Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton, semi-bighaired, man-faced), who will be the mother of John Connor, the man who would lead the human resistance against the machines when they have taken over society in 2029.<br/><br/>The humans of the future have also sent back someone through time - Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) - to stop the Terminator and save Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>Excellent concept. One major flaw. No, not that Sarah Connor lives in the painful New Wave 1980s with her brainless, bighair girlfriend, not that the Terminator has no eyebrows, not even that lame Brad Fiedel soundtrack that sounds like Oingo without the Boingo - writer-director Cameron artfully dodges the time paradox flaw created simply by sending the Terminator back through time in the first place.<br/><br/>You see, if the Terminator succeeds in killing Sarah, she will not birth the leader of the revolution, therefore the Terminator would have no reason to come back and kill her. Ergo, Terminator ceases to exist in 1984. On the other hand, if the Terminator fails to kill Sarah, it must mean the Terminator itself was terminated (for nothing else could make it fail). Either way, the Terminator ceases to exist. Good thing he's just a killing machine with no emotions, i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>And how effective was John Connor's resistance anyway, that the machines felt threatened enough to kill his mother so that he wouldn't be born? From Reese's apocalyptic flashbacks, human extermination seems to be going quite well for the machines, with Reese and his pals living like rats in sewers, bedraggled and bitchbeaten.<br/><br/>And hey! Has anyone stopped to consider that in 2029, they have Time Machines?! - that actually work! So why didn't humans send someone back to pull the plug on the machines taking over in the first place? These anomalies are explained feverishly by Reese to policemen Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen. But nobody's buying it. Especially not the fey police psychiatrist who looks like he took time off from molesting children to question Reese.<br/><br/>Both Reese and the Terminator track Sarah Connor to an embarrassing dance club called Tech Noir, spewing the lamest disco possible to represent that era, the female vocals seemingly stuck on the lyric, ""You've got me burning'!,"" pony-stepping whitebread patrons looking like honky refugees from a Pat Benatar video.<br/><br/>After the shooting starts, Reese utters one of Terminator-dom's magic lines to Sarah, ""Come with me if you want to live!"" This is also the movie where Schwarzenegger coins, ""I'll be back!"" In this perfect role for someone with no command of the English language, of his seventeen lines of dialog, these three words would become Arnold's catch-cry forever.<br/><br/>And he does come back - again and again, in mighty action sequences where he is gunned down, run over, exploded, yet relentlessly recovering and pursuing Sarah, unstoppable, Reese forever warding off the attacks. Reese tells Sarah: ""...it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear"" (he's right - seen PUMPING IRON?) ""It absolutely will not stop until you are dead."" <br/><br/>While they hide out in a roach motel, Reese puts his future-moves on Sarah, calling her a Legend and strong and brave and anything else guaranteed to moisten her man-jeans. And a pick-up line almost as good as the HIGHLANDER'S move of stabbing himself to bed Roxanne Hart: Reese gravel-whispers, ""I've memorized every line on your face. I came across time for you, Sarah. I love you. I always have."" Cue porn music, nakedness, future sperm... and Linda Hamilton getting her banana teats out for The '80s Love Scene, while looking like a man who's having a hard time turning a socket wrench. The thought surely must have crossed Reese's mind as he saw them bananas, ""Boy, Legends are easy. Comedy is hard."" <br/><br/>And then Cameron makes an excellent character move - something which no one would dream of making in later Arnold movies after his star had risen to major box-office draw - he terminates Arnold! <br/><br/>The flesh is seared off the Terminator in the last act and we see only the steel machine-man endoskeleton (created by legendary Stan Winston) pursue Sarah. This plot development, though robbing Arnold of screen time, drove home the Terminator's relentlessness; how it would literally stop at nothing, not even its flesh coming off, to complete its deadly mission. These are some of the most terrifying sequences of this modern technological horror tale, clinical, un-human; as Reese's warnings come to metal stop-motion fruition: ""...It can't be bargained with, can't be reasoned with...""<br/><br/>The dicey closeups of Arnold's prosthetic head nearly land this movie in the B-Movie crap heap, though - but we forgive Cameron and Winston; best anyone could do pre-CGI, without selling their soul to George Lucas.<br/><br/>Though the Terminator failed in its mission - leaving the future of mankind in the hands of a semi-bighaired, man-faced eighties chick - with the box office grosses nearly hitting the movie's filming budget on its opening weekend, we can be sure of at least one thing: <br/><br/>He'll be back."
"Quebec_Dragon","8","1","3","4 June 2009"," Review from first-time watcher after seeing Terminator Salvation
","I had seen numbers 2 and 3 of the series but not this one and so was interested in going back to the origins after watching the latest installment. I understand now why it was critically praised and strong enough to launch a franchise. It also helped very much into understanding some aspects of the last film. Actually, the first Terminator struck me at how internally logical it was in its fictional concept which is not an easy thing to do considering the inherent pratfalls whenever time travel is involved. It just consistently made sense compared to the plot holes of Salvation.<br/><br/>The action was obviously much lower-budget but it felt right and it looked good. The director James Cameron filmed some very effective stunts that still hold up today. You could always tell what was going on and follow the action. The terminator was an imposing menacing presence. Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role played it without showing any emotion (which makes sense) while his massive physique, ponderous movements and plastic looks (he does look artificial sometimes!) sell the character. You could nitpick that the head of Arnold was obviously replaced by a fake head sometimes (mirror scene) but weirdly it kinda worked anyway into making him more creepy. The other main roles, Sarah Connor and Reese, were played just right showing enough emotion without going into overexagerated melodrama. They were believable and likable. When reviews of Salvation complain about lack of heart, you get it more when you see the characterizations and character development here (even more so after Terminator 2).<br/><br/>Since I already knew most of the twists, from having seen the later movies, it is difficult for me to comment on them. However, I must say they were well implemented and must surely have been effective back then. The story was quite interesting and the glimpses of the future were particularly engrossing. The soundtrack sometimes seemed a bit weak with the synthesizers but one should see it as a ""time capsule"" of the eighties (time the movie takes place and when it was filmed) and basically it fits with the haircuts and wardrobes of the time. It's worth a rental as a piece of sci-fi action history or a purchase if you're a James Cameron, Schwarzenegger or Terminator fan. Be careful of which edition you get as some versions with extras do exist. <br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"

","""The Terminator"" is a classic 80s action movie. Yes, it's a bit cheesy, the special effects are obviously fake now, and there isn't a huge amount of character development in this film, but it's still the best of this series, in my opinion. This is considered to be a low budget film, as most of the stars were unknowns at the time. Now that Arnold Schwarzeneggar is a huge star (as well as governor), the film can be looked at somewhat as the beginning of a career. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is rescued from the Terminator by Kyle Reese, a man from the future who knows that Connor's son John will lead the rebellion against the takeover by robots in the future. The rest of the film consists of the two of them trying to escape this Terminator and the events that will result in John Connor's birth. It's still a great film, and the best of this series so far, even though it doesn't have great visual effects. There are good performances from the entire cast, and there are tons of humorous bits throughout the film that lighten up such a suspenseful, frightening story. ""Terminator 2"" is an impressive sequel, but because I feel it is overly violent, I'm not going to rate it higher than this film.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

Many people can say that same ideas used before ""Terminator"" - and they are right. But what James Cameron had showed people in this film? ""Terminator"" was more complex than many earliest works of different directors and writers. Cameron did quintessence of many ideas, and, i think, combined it with his own vision. Thing, that no one never did it before in one before. And finally, we have that great film ""THE TERMINATOR"" <br/><br/>When i was younger, i liked this film for it's idea, visual style, adrenaline action and for many other reasons. But since that time i've been re-watching the film so many times (about 200), so today i find it more complex and smart movie. More than that, i can really say that this film is true sci-fi classic of all time. This movie is real timeless for elder an young generations of people.

","I first saw TERMINATOR on a hotel room TV in Washington, D.C., with my wife and young daughter. I would say the film thrilled the heck out of us and probably scared my kid half to death, but the fact is, we were in a brightly lit hotel room and the TV wasn't particularly large. I know we were bowled over by the police station sequence and the final chase at the very least. This is one of Ah-nuld's best roles, and director James Cameron knows how to keep things moving along on a shoestring budget. The scene where Ah-nuld must deal with a partially ruined face is unforgettable. T2 came along a few years later and put the original to shame, much like ALIENS did to ALIEN. But if it were not for THE TERMINATOR, where would we be today? A groundbreaking sci-fi thriller, loosely based on a TV program and very old short story, by the way, neither of which is credited, as I recall."

","This was a film set before Arnold Schwarzenegger hit the big time, however we can see from his performance in this that it was well deserved. This was one of SChwarzenegger's rare performances as a villain and it was played brilliantly. This film was very low-budget however with the superb performances by Schwarzenegger, Biehn and Hamilton and the classy and stylish directing by James Cameron (A enormous career booster) this film becomes an instant classic. <br/><br/>The film opens with a glimpse at the way the world has become in the year 2029 with all of Los Angeles being a nuclear mess run by the highly sophisticated machines known as terminators. The audience is the shifted back to 1984 where both the terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) have been sent back through time. The Terminator is a bad-ass with a 'serious attitude problem' who approaches a couple of punks, beats them up and takes their clothes. Reese however finds it less easy to acquire some decent clothing, being chased by a couple of suspicious cops through an alley-way. Reese soon steals a gun off a cop and gets his clothes from a department store (with the pants being stolen by a destitute drunk). The next day, the Terminator and Reese go their separate ways, the terminator stealing several automatic weapons and looking up every ""Sarah Connor"" in the phone book, ready to do whatever it takes to kill all of them, only one being significant. Meanwhile, Reese is perfecting his gun, ready to protect the 3rd ""Sarah J. Connor"" from this terminator. After the terminator has killed the first two Connors he goes to kill the 3rd who fortunately has gone out for the evening. Sarah later realizes she is being followed by Reese and ducks into the nearest nightclub, 'tech noir' trying to blend into the crowd. Unfortunately this isn't even enough to stop the terminator and she is spotted. Reese also spots the terminator, blows him out a glass window and the two make a run for it. Non-stop action here on. This is very impressive for such a small budget, especially with some of the very impressive visual effects. Like most sci-fi films of this genre, it alludes to other works and was successfully sued by author Harlan Ellison for chunks being taken from two of his episodes of ""The Outer Limits"" in the 1960's. That however doesn't diminish this masterpiece. A notable performance by Schwarzenegger. Biehn shouldn't be forgotten either for his role as Reese with his superb acting skills and most significant character to the plot. <br/><br/>5/5"
"preppy-3","8","1","3","24 February 2006"," One of the best sci-fi action films ever made
","In 2026 machines have taken over and are killing mankind--but one man is beating them. A cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent from the future to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)-the mother of that man. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) also goes back to prevent him from killing her.<br/><br/>Now legendary science fiction action film is every bit as good as its reputation. It moves quickly and is full of action and violence almost virtually nonstop. There are plenty of exciting high speed car chases and a knockout sequence when Arnie basically decimates an entire police station--and everyone in it. The special effects are impressive especially considering this was a low-budget film. The plot is intelligent and intricate--it treats its audience with respect. There are some amusing things that date this--the VERY 80s music soundtrack, the Tech Noir club (which has a $4.50 cover charge) and hysterically bad clothes.<br/><br/>The acting isn't that good. Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as a robot and Biehn walks through his role. Only Hamilton gives a good performance--but who watches this for the acting? Also there are some familiar faces in small roles--Bill Paxton (as a punk); Dick Miller (the gun store owner); Rick Rossovich (as a doomed boyfriend) and Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen as police officers. Also this is the film that gave Arnie his infamous ""I'll be back"" line.<br/><br/>This movie has its lulls--it does come to a screeching halt when Reese and Connor get to know each other (even though that sequence IS necessary) and it does have to take time out to explain things. Still this is an exciting, violent movie well worth catching. This rightfully put director James Cameron on the map.<br/><br/>Best line: ""You're terminated f**ker!"""

The film is the classic nightmare of being chased by someone trying to kill you but you don't know why. Elements of Frankenstein, the monster built and never rests and is almost impossible to stop in its mission.<br/><br/>Why did no-one try a rocket launcher or a few grenades, or even a high power taser or anything to deliver an electric shock.

"agmoldham","7","1","3","10 April 2004"," The Best terminator
","Whereas the second film had the visuals and budget this film has got the dialogue and suspense. The dialogue is probably aided by Arnie's limited input. I'm sure everyone in the planet must know the story, but just in case, here goes. The future world is ruled by machines, but they face a struggle against a band of humans led by John Connor. They send a terminator (Schwarzenegger) back in time to kill John's mother which will thus stop John from being born. John Connor also sends someone back in time to protect his mother.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see how much Sarah ( Hamilton) developed through the films. In this she is still a sweet innocent woman who is just about to have her life turned upside down. Well directed by Cameron this is probably the best of the Terminator films."

The machine's incessant behavior is excellently portrayed by Arnold and he is definitely one bad boy in this film. He kills everyone in a police station to get at his target.

"movieguy1021","7","1","3","30 June 2003"," The Terminator: 7/10
","The Terminator may be the action movie with the most quotable lines, such as `I'll be back,' `Come with me if you want to live,' and `F**k you, a**hole.' Not only that, it's remained one of the most popular action films of the last twenty years, it's continued to delight young and old alike. Added to the mix is icon Arnold Schwarzenegger, and you have yourself one fun romp through both the present and the future.<br/><br/>When offered his job in The Terminator, Schwarzenegger was supposed to play good guy Kyle Reese, who became Michael Biehn. Schwarzenegger then played The Terminator, a cyborg from the future that came to the present (aka 1984) to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose son Michael would start in a giant war, etc. You'll figure out the plot as you go along for the ride.<br/><br/>The Terminator has something that most action movies now need: action! Instead of PG-13ing it and making it look hokey, James Cameron decided to make it as lifelike as could be, and it really did look lifelike. The effects on Schwarzenegger when he was half-human, half-cyborg looked very real, and would be considered impressive by today's standards. Not being a gigantic gore fan, I did cringe a little, but it was very cool.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence/gore, some language, and brief nudity."

","Arnold Schwarzenegger won't be known for his winning of Mr. Universe, etc. He's known for his phrase ""I'll be back"", which was made famous from The Terminator.<br/><br/>He plays The Terminator, a cyborg who comes from the future to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), an innocent waitress who doesn't believe Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) about that story. Reese also came from the future, but to protect Sarah from The Terminator, for reasons that come into detail later in the story.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger is fun as The Terminator. He only has about 10 lines to say in the entire movie, but I liked him in his futuristic role. Terminator is his most famous movie. It has action coming out the wazoo, but no real thrills. The 108 minute run-time seemed to go by quickly.<br/><br/>The special FX, for 1984, were pretty good. Despite what it seemed, the exo-skeleton at the end was not stop-motion as it looked like, it was an animatronic puppet. The explosions looked real, so did all the shootings, and everything else. Biehn was very good as the guy from the future. He seemed to know what he was doing. I wonder why he hasn't been in much lately, though.<br/><br/>Hamilton was good, too, as Sarah, but nothing to write home about. Terminator has set an example for others to follow in action movies. Many spoof movies have the ""terminator sight"", and say ""I'll be back"", and all the other catch phrases from the movie. I thought it also had some good places of humor, like all movies should. It is entertaining, also. The dreary look at the future seems almost farcical now, since we now know that there won't be a nuclear war around 1990. So that means it's a little outdated, but it's still fun (if lacking thrills), and recommended.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence and some language."

","Sorry, I like Terminator but don't hold it in the same esteem as many others. I just don't see that it is any better than any other good and fun sci fi films that really aren't much more than a thrill ride.<br/><br/>But one thing it does have going for it that's great is that it shows how ridiculous the notion of time travel really is. For those who think such must be possible, you probably slept through or didn't take a class in physics. Since time is nothing more than an arbitrary measurement of relative motion of objects in relation to one another, it does not truly have a forward or backward direction. Einstein knew this and that's why he related time to physical motion, hence the name, Theory of Relativity, and he saw the perception of time as variable dependent upon the relative ""speed"" of the subject, but it's doubtful that many sci-fi fans understand this. (As proof. watch how many NO's I get on this) They believe that one can fall into a black hole and pop out through a wormhole into another time or faraway location in the universe, when all that would happen is they'd be crushed into being part of the dense matter of the black hole.<br/><br/>The abstract ideations called ""the past"" and ""the future"" are more a product of mental awareness of this motion which creates events that are kept in memory (known to us as the past) or events considered as possible through conjecture (known as the future). Time travel only can exist as a mental abstract ideation, and that's it.<br/><br/>Such travel is shown as being physically impossible in Terminator due to this scenario: Terminator is sent to the past by cyborg rulers to kill the birth mother of human John Conner, who threatens later cyborg rule. Human Reese is sent by humans to stop the terminator. He becomes the father of human John Conner who later threatens cyborg rule. Basically an impossible event, shown as such by what would have been the initial series of events, as envisioned this way...<br/><br/>Mom Conner would not have had son John in the first place without Reese, who would not have been sent after all because the terminator would not have been sent since John did not exist. Or envision this...<br/><br/>Had cyborg rulers not sent terminator, then Reese would not go and could not father John Conner....<br/><br/>And there are many other variations on these scenarios as well...<br/><br/>Pretty much an impossible conundrum, which just goes to show that the notions of past and future only exist in our mental awareness, and everything that actually exists in our reality and our universe really has just one time of existence, the now and present.<br/><br/>Even our memories of the past, notions of the future, and awareness of current existence which is due to the relative motion of objects, all happen within the now and present, the only actual ""time"" that is based in reality.<br/><br/>For those who would dismiss this because you really want to believe in time travel, well, you certainly aren't Einstein."

In this sad scenario a woman named Sarah Conner who is In fact the mother of the leader of man kinds resistance against these murderous machines is to be killed. A very comforting thought knowing a girl who can't even get her tables orders straight will be our salvation.<br/><br/>It business as usual for our heroine as she lands comfortably in her role as a 1980s twenty something. After ducking a phone call for her roommate that would land most men on the sex offender list , she is dumped on an evening dinner by her yuppie boyfriend. After being groped on her way she sets out for an average night in an average area of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>During all this hoopla , two beings have arrived from the future. One is a terminator. A machine from the future sent back to the pre - internet era to kill Sarah Conner , and along the way mangle half the phone books in town. The other arrival is an enlisted army officer Named Kyle Reese. His job is effectively protect Sarah from the terminator using a rock salt gun and several firecrackers.<br/><br/>The terminator begins killing Sarah Conner's all over Los Angeles in phone book order. ( this is why your number should always be unlisted folks.) Soon LAPD catches on and is out in force looking for our Sarah who is next on the list. This information reaches her by television at a local three star non zagat rated pizza joint. Immediately at this critical moment she goes to the pay phone to call the police station. It is out of order. To bad cell phones have not been invented.<br/><br/>She decides that paying five bucks to make a pay phone call at a new wave bar on Pico ave. is the way to go. Nothing beats good new wave music , particularly in a movie whose soundtrack is recorded in the marvelous enriching acoustics of mono. After a shoot out and car chase with the terminator Conner is brought up to speed on her predicament. Both are then captured by the cops.<br/><br/>The cops have very little time to sort things out before lugnuts shows up for some drive thru. After mowing through and entire department , the chase resumes. This is the area of the film where Sarah and Kyle fall in love though even 2017 most die hard fans of the movie admit how that happened is over their heads. Maybe , getting pregnant by a guy you have known for 60 minutes whilst being hunted by the Mobile version of CORTANA was hot for women back then who knows.<br/><br/>After , their "" romance "" , the machine finds them at their no star motel and it's back to business as usual. After a round of explosions and car crashes , pretty cut rate at the time as well , they blow up the bad guy. It must have really burned to see it walk out after being killed. Anyway as the computer killer robot hunts our two heroes they decide hiding in a computer factory is their best bet. Nothing like giving your opponent home court advantage to turn the tide in your favor. Either way the machines mission objectives are finally ...crushed.<br/><br/>So you have read this and are thinking OK , cheap budget effects it's the 80's. The plot is coherent and the acting not too shabby with a pretty good cast for its day. What gives bro?<br/><br/>Simple logic. The movie is not the movie it could be. In the DVD release of this film there are deleted scenes . In one of these scenes Sarah and Kyle are at some stopping point on their journey and Sarah points out to Kyle that she has found the address of the computer company responsible for the creation of the system in the first place. Why not blow it up , and skip the whole thing? <br/><br/>Because then we could not have several pointless sequels , another of which commits the same act only for us to receive more pointless sequels. I guess it is all you could expect from the guy that gave you Rambo.<br/><br/>These people act like all they care about is money and the quality of their work is secondary. Completely inexcusable."

"johnnyboyz","7","1","4","13 April 2017"," More lacking beneath the surface of explosions and gunfire than I remember, but still very much worth a watch.
","The story goes that the inspiration behind the idea of the Terminator films derives from a bout of illness its creator, James Cameron, had whilst working on a previous project that had tumbled into being a bit of a creative nightmare. Frantically trying to piece what turned out to be ""Piranha: The Spawning"" together in an edit lab against a ticking clock, Cameron became run down by something which gave him all sorts of unpleasant dreams about indestructible robots chasing him; his life being in mortal danger and nobody believing him.<br/><br/>It is perhaps the nightmarish quality of ""The Terminator"" which really allows it to stand out. Let us not mince our words, here – Cameron essentially hopped from one exploitation feature to another in making it. Everything that needs to be present for an effective Z-movie is present: the gore; the action; the nudity; the causality and the lack of a plot. That is not to be rude to the IDEA, which is wonderful - a robot killing machine is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of a brave resistance leader, who is proving to be a thorn in the side of the metal maniacs in their attempts to wipe out every last human-being. One of Cameron's characters even pokes fun at the premise, describing what the robot is attempting to do as a kind of ""retroactive abortion"". It is, however, little more than a cue for all-out mayhem across the urban sprawl of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>We have all read the essays and digested the feminist theory which revolves around the character of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) enough times by now for anybody to need to rehash it here. Put simply, Connor is the aforementioned target – the protagonist who learns of her destiny and is taken from being your generic bimbo, and a useless waitress, to a brave soldier. Later theory would revolve around Connor and the Terminator character transgressing their respective roles in the sequel, which had the 'killer' robot being reprogrammed to become a mother/guardian figure and Hamilton's character tooling up to wipe out a defenceless anomaly (Miles Bennett Dyson) for being something they were not even privy to.<br/><br/>Chasing Connor here is Arnold Schwarzenegger's titular Terminator: a metal exoskeleton operating underneath living flesh tissue and impervious to the pathetic weaponry of the 1980's, while also sent back is one of the future humans' top fieldsmen in Kyle Reece (Michael Biehn). One of the most endearing things about watching the film now, I suppose, is that each are playing the roles they are most famous for. The opening exchanges, as both time-travellers adapt to their surroundings; tools up to take the other on and go about hunting down Sarah, are good value. We witness The Terminator dealing with three rough-shot punks upon arrival with the simplest of ease, while Reece is depicted as actually having to run away and hide when the police pick up on his otherworldly arrival. Cameron's goal is fairly obvious: the odds are stacked against the good guys.<br/><br/>What follows is by no means 'bad', but it is remarkable as to how quickly the film settles into a causality driven process of action; chase and recovery – something is to be said, however, in the way Cameron kicks things back into life via the ingenious ways the Terminator picks back up on his prey again when it seems they've gotten away. More substantial is Cameron's social commentary, not to mention the love story which develops between Reece and Connor. Cameron shoots on location in Los Angeles at night, capturing the down-to-Earth reality of homelessness; street hoodlums and the general junk and filth which litters the streets – making, in the process, a correlation between the nightmarish ruined LA of the future, where the war is taking place. The film goes on to use a very clever transitional edit using a caterpillar track during scene whereby Reece falls asleep and dreams of the future to reiterate this: utopias do not exist.<br/><br/>Digging a little deeper, and analysing some of the franchise's cod-philosophies to do with destiny; making the future what it is and not being bound to your fate, may very well reveal one or two more truths, but that is for the individual viewer. On the whole, and while I am unsure as to whether there is as much substance here as everybody seems to remember, ""The Terminator"" does very little of what it attempts to do especially badly, and I think that is what propels its lasting power."
"cousinoleg","8","1","4","5 July 2015"," Under a sci-fi action movie lies a prophetic Christian-inspired message
","As a Christian I'll try by God's help to uncover the spiritual meaning and influences of this movie, including the causes of its popularity and enduring factor.<br/><br/>I watched it more than 20 years ago, even before really believing in God and His Son and my Lord Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>At first sight Terminator seems to be a typical late 70s-early 80s action/horror movie, which were mostly based during the night, like early John Carpenter's movies Halloween, Attack on Precinct 13 and Escape from New York, which adds to the fear factor, as having a seemingly unstoppable and almost silent villain, who seems to represent pure evil, barely stopped by a final girl.<br/><br/>The cause might be rooted in the global politic and economical crisis which was occurring then, lack of resources, large unemployment, rise of crime, as well as fear of nuclear war.<br/><br/>The difference is that Terminator offers a solution to these fears, a savior figure who could deliver the humanity even from the case of the worst – a nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>The main source of inspiration for Terminator is actually Christian faith and the Bible, which already predicted a future Judgement day, great tribulation, as well the Savior in Son of God Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>I think it is by God's help that this movie was made, even in Hollywood industry, a money-making business; but nobody likes pure materialism, hence it is the spiritual subtext acts as a parable, assuring its popularity, despite increasing apostasy from Christian faith and worldliness.<br/><br/>As God and Lord Jesus Christ said: ""Therefore speak I to them in parables: because seeing they see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."" (Matthew 13:13)<br/><br/>Sarah Connor a young woman, a to be mother of the future savior, John Connor. The names seem inspired from Sarah wife of Abraham, who miraculously by God's help bore Isaac in her old age, as Bible says ""Through your descendant all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me"" and name of Jesus Christ with initials JC, led to Sarah and John Connor (JC).<br/><br/>It is shown that in the future an artificial intelligence called Skynet attempted to destroy all humanity by starting a nuclear war and extermination of humans in death camps.<br/><br/>However humans led by John Connor managed to defeat it, so to prevent its destruction it built a time machine and sent a killer cyborg into the past, called the terminator, to kill the mother of the unborn John Connor, Sarah.<br/><br/>Terminator acts like king Herod, who ordered killing of all children from Bethlehem to kill also the king of Israel and Messiah Jesus Christ, attempting to kill all women called Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>The terminator seems to be influenced by earlier movie robot types such as evil clone of Maria from 1920s Metropolis, also with deep Christian influences.<br/><br/>Having no shame, no guilt, no fear, no mercy, acting like a beast, not a human, he seems to be inspired by image of the beast from the book of Revelation ""And he (beast of earth) had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.."" (Revelation 13:5-6)<br/><br/>In this lies conviction of those who are human in appearance only, but are like beasts in their action, lacking love, care, goodness which come only from God, who makes us human.<br/><br/>To protect Sarah Connor, her son John sends one of his soldiers Kyle Reese, as was mentioned in one internet article, acting as both angel Gabriel and Holy Spirit of God, telling Sarah about her future son and conceiving him in her.<br/><br/>In this is the paradox enacted, the son acts like his own father, by sending his real father to save him and conceive him from his mother. It is close to the Christian faith notion of trinity, where God is altogether Father, Son and Holy Spirit, as humans made in his image are composed of mind, body and spirit, yet are one being.<br/><br/>After a long round of chases, Sarah and Kyle manage to damage and burn the flesh of the cyborg, as was prophesied: ""And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."" (Revelation 19:20)<br/><br/>By the last remaining bomb, the terminator is badly damaged, crawling without feet, Kyle is killed and Sarah badly injured, unable to walk too. Finally she manages to crush it under a press, reminding me the Genesis prophecy from God about serpent aka Satan's fight against humans and being destroyed by a hit to the head:<br/><br/>""And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life: And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."" (Genesis 3:14-15)<br/><br/>Thus i thank God and Lord Jesus Christ for giving me wisdom to uncover it as an apocalyptic tale of struggle between Satan and Jesus Christ who will win and will lead his people to the promised land, God's Kingdom of Heaven."

","I stayed away from this for thirty years but finally got fed up of all the people absolutely amazed I hadn't seen it and recommending it to me before it's too late. Well, it's fairly exciting enough as a low budget sci fi chiller, but does everyone really have to enjoy the same things? And judging by the music and special effects, in this case it's too late. Even if I'd seen it at an impressionable age such macho machinations were never my bag.<br/><br/>An impregnable robot sent from 45 years in the way distant future to kill a woman who will have an important son, and another man from the future is sent to save herand unwittingly impregnate her too. Busy! The futuristic '80's music is as cheap, backward and laughable as Blade Runner's is, they also share a vision of an extremely grim future. The present is merely cars girls guns and mayhem after all. Schwarzenegger as the Terminator robot acted totally believably, and when reduced to the hilarious internal metal frame he acted with even more passion; but Harryhausen's stop motion skeletons in Jason & The Argonauts were as kittens in comparison. Made at the butt-end of the olde analogue age I bet director Cameron wished he could have done a Lucas-like Revision to it and rebooted it with cgi cartoonery for the special effects instead. However, the over the top violence was expected and delivered - the utter childishness of the multiple random killings only proves yet again to me how valueless some human film makers think other human beings lives are and therefore the contempt they must hold the audiences in. But I do realise you don't have to be in the Army to fight in the War, and most importantly this is mild stuff compared to nowadays. The film was all I expected, take away the viciousness and you might have a very good little b film."

","A strange man comes to the earth from somewhere. We all think he is crazy, because he does not wear any clothes. He has much power, and people can't fight against him. Some women are killed by him, and one lady is being target of him even she does nothing. Is she alright? Who is going to save her and stop him? This story is very thrilling, but has some emotional parts. I like the way to show that the strange man is very strong. He is in good shape, and also does not smile at all. When I thought of the time that this man comes to the real word, I could help feeling fearful. However, this happening is never occurred in this world, so I could enjoy watching the film. On the other hand, the content is a little bit complicated for me, especially, the relationships among people. One more thing I was surprised to see is that there are some grotesque scenes in the film. If you don't want to see blood or this kind of scenes, I recommend you to close your eyes, actually I did so. On the whole, it was thrilling, so for me, person who likes sort of this, it made me enjoy."
"Exeron","7","1","4","17 June 2008"," The Terminator
","I'm pretty sure everybody got a clue of what ""The Terminator"" is about. The year is 1984, A terminator (Arnold) is sent from the future to prevent John Connor being borned. John Connor is the leader of those who fight against the terminators. The terminator's job is then to hunt down the mother of the leader, Sarah Connor. But then, sent by John Connor, Kyle Reese. His mission is to protect Sarah from danger.<br/><br/>The film is relatively exciting, but somehow i lost the tense and the excitement when i got deeper into the movie. People have been talking about it and said it's really good, so i actually thought i was about to watch a masterpiece.<br/><br/>In my opinion, The Terminator is far from a masterpiece, but it's far from bad too. I mean Arnold did some decent acting, but then again he does play a robot. And the movie had 'some' Special FX that would even look good today. When i said 'some' i really mean it. Because most of the Special FX looks pretty lousy today, but i'm not going to judge the movie from that.<br/><br/>So to conclude this whole ""review"", if you like. I didn't really feel the movie. I understand completely how it must have been back in '84. But i'm living in a society where the audience demands are pretty high. So with all this concluded i can simply say that Terminator isn't a bad movie, but it isn't that great either. But it gives a pretty good picture of the future i guess.<br/><br/>7/10 A good, not great, not excellent, but a good SCI-FI picture..."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","4","7 January 2006"," It's already a classic!
","I imaging that in 50 years from now, or even more, people will still be watching this movie withs lots of joy and respect. Even though the movie its look is already outdated, it still is a movie that speaks to the imagination and is both tense and spectacular to watch. ""The Terminator"" is one of those movies everyone should have seen at least once in his or hers life.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Terminator"" already such a classic today is a combination of certain factors. Of course the title character 'The Terminator' played by Arnold Schwarzenegger is perhaps the biggest reason. He doesn't have to speak any lines to make a lasting impression. His presences and looks is more than enough to make his character a classic one. Another element is the fantastic imaginative futuristic story and concept, that is made totally believable thanks to the professionality of both cast and crew. Action-director James Cameron uplifts the movie with some dynamic action sequences and shootouts, despite the movie its fairly low-budget.<br/><br/>Lets be fair, ""The Terminator"" is a B-movie. The special effects are below average, even for 1984 standards, the actors are B-stars (Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen, who I both really like as actors by the way, are the biggest indication of this.) and the story is of course incredibly B-movie like once you start thinking about it. The movie however is really uplifted by mainly the directing from James Cameron and the presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger. It gives the movie both a sense of reality and tension as well as making it spectacular and action filled.<br/><br/>The movie has '80's written all over it. The clothes, the hair, and the ultimate '80's music and musical score by Brad Fiedel, it's all terribly '80's like which makes this movie perhaps a bit more outdated than it is.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie also has some (unesacary) slow moments toward the ending of the movie. It doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie which is fast paced and action packed. I also was never a big fan of the ending. Once Arnie seizes to be 'The Terminator' it's not as tense and scary anymore.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is a fantastic and already classic science-fiction/action movie with thriller elements in it.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I feel the best thing they did with this one is Linda Hamilton's character, Sarah Connor. They really take their time into making her slowly accept and learns from the crazy situation she finds herself in. Linda is absolutely perfect in the role, and we see a transformation from a normal girl that wanted to have dates to a survivor. Also, the relationship with her protector from the future is also well done. She makes it work, because Michael Biehn absolutely sucks.<br/><br/>In that sense, the movie lacks acting quality besides Linda Hamilton (which wasn't amazing, but great for the role). Even Arnold doesn't quite nail the ""machine from the future"", in my opinion.<br/><br/>The dialogue is awful. Most of the time is terrible exposition, but is also bad when helps the characterization of our leads.<br/><br/>But that doesn't matter that much, because it is a pure action/sci-fi movie. The ending ties it all up, and even if the action gets a bit repetitive for me, it still good."

I was a bit confused over what was going on in the first half of the movie that I didn't get any explanation just the the second half, which is my biggest problem in this film.

This science fiction film, directed by James Cameron, has become a classic despite what I have previously stated. The horrid violence of this film is not the worst part, but rather than even the time travel to the past is not very interesting either.

And the father of this great hero is a soldier, sent after the cyborg, to prevent him from fulfilling his mission. If this isn't ingenious, nothing is! And, above this, The Terminator is a very diverse film as well. It's a shocking thriller (the hunt for Sarah Connor) as well as a dared, intense drama (the huge load of innocent victims).

It isn't that there's very much distinctive about the film, except maybe its all-gray pallet and the overall darkness. Of course it's easier to shoot in LA at night when the city is empty of all human tissue. If you want to make a movie about the last person on earth, shoot it in downtown LA on a weekend. Come to think of it, they already have -- ""The Omega Man."" It's not possible to explain the success of this flick. The only thing you can say is that it succeeds on its own terms. It has no moral, like ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" no resonance beyond its violence. If the acting is good enough that's largely because so little is called for. The best performance is given by the two cops. Arnold comes in a close second. His best moments come when he is not on screen but has been replaced by a completely metallic skeletal cyborg that is blown to bits -- an ear here, a humerus there -- until he is finally extinguished by this gigantic duck press. <br/><br/>That's not to put down Linda Hamilton. She is plump lipped, hair blown, and sexy. She was my supporting player in another film, one that I think everyone would agree is a masterpiece of cinematic high art, a nonpareil of poetics, and an unforgettable action drama in itself -- ""King Kong Lives."" Michael Biene falls a bit short of the bar set by Linda Hamilton.<br/><br/>But what does any of that matter? You can watch the thing repeatedly. It's almost hypnotic."

","There are those who believe in fate, and the smallest decisions and actions could determine a person's whole future, well imagine what would happen if the future came to you, a fantastically inventive idea from director James Cameron (Aliens, Titanic). It is 1984, and from a flash comes the human looking machine (cyborg) from the future, 2029, called the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). This machine is on a mission to kill a woman who is key to what could help the future, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), and the only man she can count on who knows most about this future is Kyle Reese (Michael Beihn), who also came from it. He tells her all about the Terminator, the war (Judgement Day) and why it is important she lives. She is the mother of the man who is the saviour for the human race, John Connor. Also starring Paul Winfield as Lieutenant Ed Traxler, Aliens' Lance Henriksen as Detective Hal Vukovich, Bess Motta as Ginger Ventura, Earl Boen as Dr. Peter Silberman, Rick Rossovich as Matt Buchanan and Dick Miller as Pawnshop Clerk. The film is made up of many gripping chases, fantastic gory effects (as the Terminator loses his flesh in his hunt, and it is a low budget film!) and fantastic direction from Cameron. The excellent sequel followed in 1991. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Terminator (Villain) was number 22 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""I'll be back.""), it was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 98 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!"

","Here we go, the movie that started it all and wasn't Arnold believable as a robot? He came across as threatening and creepy as all get out, and the thick accent really played for the role.<br/><br/>And then, of course, the plot was so unbelievable that it sucked everyone right in, from the start you suspended your disbelief because you knew it was going to be one heck of a ride.<br/><br/>The cinematography was absolutely brilliant, everything seemed to fall into place perfectly for the first outing of the Terminator franchise and we got to see Sarah Connor transform from a frightened waitress at the start of the film, to someone that would become on of science-fiction's best known heroes by the end of it.<br/><br/>It was a truly fantastic film."
"davine-371-641417","7","0","2","31 March 2020"," Possibly awesome at time, but nearly 40 years later?
","My take from this was a film that's key draw is the cinematic experience and thrill of the chase of being chased down by a futuristic cyborg. Like many things though, the cgi ages massively, even if that's an unfair criticism to make (though star wars earlier than this, shows it doesnt need to be the case). Towards the end sequence, this really shows.<br/><br/>Only thing I'd say is the protagonists arent the most likeable characters, so it makes it a little bit harder to root for them which is I guess the aim of the narrative.<br/><br/>But overall it's an enjoyable and simple hollywood watch, and sure it would have been even greater at the time."

"rajveerdhanak","8","0","2","27 January 2020"," A low-budget start to a high-budget franchise
","After years of procrastinating on starting the series, I finally got around to watching 'The Terminator' - a relatively low-budget film that spawned a series of high-budget films, which I plan to watch in chronology. Not to mention how this film had very successfully launched the directorial career of James Cameron and solidified Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career.<br/><br/>'The Terminator' follows Kyle Reese, a human soldier tasked to stop an indestructible cyborg killing machine - both sent from 2029 - from executing a young woman, whose unborn son is the key to humanity's future salvation.<br/><br/>It becomes clear from the basic structure and narrative elements of the film that Cameron was inspired by horror-slasher films like 'Halloween' and the dystopian sci-fi films of that era such as 'Escape from New York' and 'Mad Max', as the similarity becomes more apparent with time.<br/><br/>Though the world-building and mythos-creation of the film is excellent, the plotline is quite predictable, emotional moments feel forced and contrived for the plot, and the 80's cheesiness is apparent through the dialogues and performances. Even the romance subplot feels sudden and contrived for the sake of establishing the predestined fate of the movie's plot.<br/><br/>Personally, the story of how this film came to be is more interesting than the actual film - and I don't mean that as a detriment to the film's quality. The noticeable prosthetics and dated visual effects that may hamper the initial viewing experience eventually becomes more fascinating once you find out the amount of hard-work, rejections and creative problem-solving it took to make this sci-fi film in the 80s - an era that hadn't yet developed visual effects as we now take for granted."

With a dynamic, fluid, pop style (wonderful electronic soundtrack), and atmosphere of anxiety due to the darkness, Cameron manages to create the most terrible menace for men about technology: a Terminator, a machine come from the future to destroy humans. And the machine can't be dropped: the difference from humans is properly in its incapacity to understand emotion and to understand limits; if it's created for destroy, if it understands just the obligation to live better (and for this also killing creators, seen as weak and imperfect), nothing can't defeat it, and the last scene, with the Termination disposed to fight until it can reveals this strange creepy strength that comes not from willing but from a mechanical rationality and program. A cult for sci-fi world, but also in its pop nature full f philosophical contents."

"robfollower","10","0","2","2 November 2019"," The thing that won't die, and the nightmare that won't end.
","T1 is really a pretty smart movie. It's Man vs. Machine in a really fake, low budget future. For the Machines to win, they send back a killer robot to kill Sarah Connor, who will mother a child named John, who in turn will grow up and one day lead The Resistance against the Machines. With her dead, no John, and the Machines win. So Man sends a man back in time (apparently, 10 years from now, in 2029, we'll be able to time travel) to stop The Terminator so John can be born. The story holds up nicely, but the action sequences have been done to death so many times since, they don't fare as well. Yet the movie manages to give you the feeling that the studio had no part in the creative process, and let them just make their little movie. Here's $6 mil, Jimmy, go out and play. I just read that James Cameron had the image of the metallic skeleton killer robot first, and worked backwards from there. And because of budget constrictions (he couldn't have a future that looked all that good, in the movie, not in real life), so he made it a time travel story so he can shoot in present day. Pretty cool, if it's true. I wonder if that happened to him with TITANIC?<br/><br/>So like I said, some of the movie doesn't kick the way it did in 1984. For that matter, what does? David Lee Roth? Anyway, the good far outweighs the bad, and if you haven't seen it in decades, you should watch it again."

As a kid games like missile command and movies like war games were a constant reminder of the possibility of a nuclear war. Never really considering what might start a nuclear war the intelligent machine sci-fi aspect of the movie is original. A Terminator hunting down mercilessly is a terrifying thought.

"josephrygaard","9","0","2","14 September 2019"," Before Watching: The Terminator (1984)
","""The Terminator"" (1984) or just ""Terminator"" is a classic sci-fi movie as well as the start of the sci-fi saga with the same name. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Terminator is a pure 80's movie. It includes action elements like guns, explosions and shootings, together with some rock-hard testosterone from Schwarzenegger himself. The score is superb, being a mixture of analogue synths together with futuristic sound effects. The special effects and stop motion are quite obviously from the 80's as well, being a bit premature yet not too clunky. All in all - very 80's straight through, and it has in this aspect very similar vibes to Aliens and Die Hard.<br/><br/>However, Terminator also features very human elements and feelings. Relationships feel real, and although crude language and nudity occur, the atmosphere is surprisingly cozy in-between the action. Perhaps due to the strong 80's vibe and subsequent nostalgia, yet in this aspect it is the strongest entry in the franchise. The time travel paradoxes don't stumble but flow smoothly in the narrative, although it will still require some attention.<br/><br/>A slight in-depth note: a few viewers might wonder why Terminator sometimes isn't as accurate of a shooter as you would expect a computer to be. One plausible explanation could be that, according to the movie, the technological advancements stopped or slowed down considerably in 1997 when the war began. If the CPU in Terminator is on roughly the same level, perhaps some calculations for bullet trajectories could struggle to be calculated and executed in real-time.<br/><br/>Conclusively - Terminator is a great gem in both being an entertaining and human sci-fi, as well as being a prime demonstration on the topmost shape of 80's movies. Now, go and see Terminator 2 - Judgment Day.<br/><br/>My personal grade: an electrifying 9/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

","Revisiting THE TERMINATOR after many years, was a lot of fun. Seeing how much Director, James Cameron did w/ his relatively small budget, is quite amazing! This movie was certainly groundbreaking, w/ Cameron reinventing the science fiction / action film. The result is a magnificent time-travel / pre-post-apocalyptic story, set in 1980's, urban Los Angeles. One aspect that boosts this into the stratosphere is the weaving of true horror into the story. There is genuine, malevolent menace hanging over the entire movie, and one classic scene of homicidal mayhem after another! Fast-paced and unrelenting, this movie delivers action that was rarely witnessed in its day. Perhaps, only the original, 1970's-early 80's MAD MAX or ROAD WARRIOR films could hope to compete w/ Cameron's hyper-speed vision. Who better to play the murderous, virtually unstoppable title role than Arnold Schwarzenegger? He was perfectly suited for it, both physically and vocally w/ his deep, Austrian accent. Linda Hamilton convincingly takes her Sarah Connor character from a meek and frightened ""waitress"", to a hardened, iconic warrior over the course of the film. Michael Beihn is the third part of this trinity, as the mysterious Kyle Reese. Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen put in great supporting performances as the ill-fated cops on the case. Truly, one for the ages, and only the beginning of the huge, successful careers of both Cameron and Schwarzenegger!... EXTRA POINTS FOR: The flash-forward scenes of the futuristic wasteland!

When a story is so original, you do not understand entirely what is going on, you can not blink and left in awe trying to grasp what this machine man robot means . The 80s is captured for eternal here, the big hairs, seedy discotheques, synthesizer and more. As this film is going at such fast rate throughout, one was wondering why the need to kill all Sarah Connor, thus only when Michael Biehn , savior of Sarah played by the unassuming Linda Hamilton came into play was it clearer. The effects , those days standards, were so good, a lot of people were screaming at the theatre thinking that the Terminator gets out of the screen onto us. Arnold Schwarzenegger is convincing and I can not imagine what happened if Dolph Lundgren got the role instead as it was rumored that he was offered the role as well. From the T1000 franchise, this is the story and special effects pacesetter of many action films to come."

","Somewhat plagiarized and cliché. Another monster-chase movie with a science fiction twist. The scenes from the near-future are understated yet effective. It's kind of low budget as there are only a handful of ""extras"" and a few killer machines shown at a time. The matte paintings seem very ""static"". Almost non-stop action for most-of-the-time and Arnold has the time-of-his-life annihilating everything in sight, except the right Sarah Connor and her real big dog. Young Arnold is in incredible physical shape. Warning: ""cheeky"" male nudity and one female topless shot during obligatory ""copulation"". Overly bloody and violent? Sure. Do all ""action"" movies have to have an exploding gasoline tanker? (yes) I have always considered this to be the ""prequel"" for Terminator 2, which I like far better. It's a real ""Ying and Yang"". Here Mr. Muscles is too mean and in #2 he's a bit too nice. I have yet to see all the sequels that follow, as I suspect it's like ""Star Wars"" with it's many unoriginal and similar story-lines? Stan Winston Studios crafted a great Terminator ""puppet"" and the slight amount of stop-motion animation does not deter the overall effect. The surgical scenes always left me a little queasy, but are very well done. Please pass the popcorn!"
"justin-fencsak","10","0","2","23 August 2017"," The movie that made Arnold a sci-fi star!!!
","If Conan made Arnold a worldwide sword and sandal superstar, then The Terminator made him a sci-fi god. The directorial debut of James Cameron, this 1984 classic set the stage for countless sequels, a prequel TV series, and lots of merchandise. Arnold shows his prowess as the Terminator, a man sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton (who reprises her role in the sequel). Kyle Reese, played by Michael Beihn, is also sent from the future, this time to prevent her and her future son. The 2001 MGM DVD is highly recommended as it contains a 5.1 remix of the original mono track along with the mono track plus lots of special features."
"EISMediaGroup","Null","0","1","21 July 2017"," The reason that Kyle Reese did not have to go back in time to save Sarah Connor
","After having watched the ""Terminator"" franchise in its entirety over the past week, I have come to a realization.<br/><br/>In ""The Terminator"" (1984) the ""Resistance"" led by John Connor, having already won the war in the original (and most definitive) timeline, needed not send Kyle Reese back in time to save Sarah Connor from the T-800 that was sent to kill her. John Connor had already been born, and the war had already been won.<br/><br/>This is how I see ""The Terminator"" (1984) playing out if The T-800 had been sent back in time by Skynet to kill Sarah, and Kyle Reese had not been sent back in time by John Connor to protect Sarah.<br/><br/>-Sarah Connor was already carrying the child of Stan Morsky which would later become John Connor.<br/><br/>-The T-800 would have gone on its killing spree looking for Sarah Connor, capturing the attention of the news media, and prompting Sarah to seek police protection.<br/><br/>-The police would have arrived at the Tech Noir club sooner and picked up Sarah before the T-800 arrived because the police would not have been stalled due to Kyle Reese's presence in the area. (He was being looked for as well because of his assault on police in the beginning of the movie).<br/><br/>-The Police would have taken Sarah into protective custody.<br/><br/>-The T-800's search would have been stalled.<br/><br/>-Eventually Sarah Connor would have been moved to a military compound after police see that the killer, (The T-800) had not been apprehended or found.<br/><br/>-The T-800 would find Sarah's mother's address after having killed Ginger and Matt in Sarah's apartment.<br/><br/>-The T-800 would kill Sara's mother and ""copy"" her.<br/><br/>-Sarah would eventually call her ""mother"" from the military compound with her whereabouts with the T-800 intercepting the information.<br/><br/>-The T-800 would stock up on weapons at gun stores and kill the clerks, further drawing the attention of law enforcement and military personnel.<br/><br/>-The T-800 would storm the military compound with the police in hot pursuit as well as the military, the navy , and the coast guard having been alerted of it's presence in the vicinity of the compound.<br/><br/>-The military personnel would shoot the T-800 down with rifles. The T-800 would continue to advance.<br/><br/>-Seeing that their bullets had little effect on him, they would begin shooting him with grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles decimating him.<br/><br/>-Bits and pieces of the T-800's cpu chips and the electrical components that constitute the T-800 were found, studied and duplicated preserving the Skynet foundational elements (These elements were already inevitable in the ""Terminator universe however.) <br/><br/>-Skynet, judgement day, and the war against the machines commences.<br/><br/>-John Connor and the resistance defeats Skynet in 2029.<br/><br/>-Movie over."

","'THE TERMINATOR' was directed by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwartzeneger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. ​In the not too distant future, the machine have taken over out world and set out to exterminate the human race. The machines send back The Terminator(Arnold Schwartzenger), a cyborg killing machine with one objective: Eliminate Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). Rebellion leader, John Connor, sends back Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah and defeat The Terminator once and for all!<br/><br/>This movie is awesome. Do I think it's the greatest action or science-fiction movie of all time? God no. It's fantastic for what it is but I don't believe that it is a masterpiece. Needless to say, the acting and action is superb. I mean it is pretty close to perfect in some areas. Cameron's world building is incredible and he is a master at drawing the audience into his world. This movie is fantastic and I highly recommend you see it.<br/><br/>The story is great and very well written. Cameron is seriously a genius at world building and is very in depth at describing this world. That is also one of the movie's downfalls. This in depth world building required a lot of exposition and that doesn't work towards the movie's favour. Obviously a lot of exposition was needed for a new IP of this scale but everything can be toned down a bit and condensed and that is what I wish happened here. The climax is fantastic and possibly one of the best ever put to film. I wont spoil it for anyone who hasn't watched it but I can assure you it is awesome. I wasn't too impressed by the ending because I predicted it but if you were, I wont take that away from you. It's a good ending I just saw it coming.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger is cold, calculating and ruthless. I love it. The Terminator is one of the greatest antagonists in movie history and nothing can take that title away from him. The fact that he is relentless is terrifying and Schwarzenegger really sells that side of the character. Truly a masterclass of character creation.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton was great as Sarah Connor and I really bought her arc from the beginning of the movie to the end. She starts as a bumbling waitress with a lot to live up to but slowly evolves into that legend and that is mostly down to Hamilton's awesome performance. She was the 80s Ripley. That is probably the best way of putting it.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn was surprisingly great as Kyle Reese. The point of his character was primarily to deliver exposition to the audience which isn't exactly great character work but aside from that he's an interesting human being that has a fascinating background that isn't really explained but is clear through Biehn's brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, this is a very well done movie. Aside from one messy semi-action sequence in the middle, I was very pleased with how the movie was shot and edited. The lighting is fantastic. Costume design is great. Set design is fantastic. The visual effects in this movie are mind-blowing and all effects used on The Terminator should be retroactively awarded an Oscar.<br/><br/>It is also one of the most quotable movies in history. 'Come with me if you want to live' and 'I'll be back' are arguably two of the greatest lines of dialogue ever uttered on screen. The quote 'Listen, and understand. That terminator is out there, it cant be bargained with, it cant be reasoned with, it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear, and it absolutely will not stop...EVER, until you are dead!' is one of my favourite lines of dialogue in film history and is truly the definition of perfection. It gives me chills whenever I hear it and is a work of art as far as writing goes.<br/><br/>Brad Fiedel's score for this movie is awesome and I absolutely treasure the score that signals impending doom from The Terminator. It is fantastic and I cannot praise that score any more. It is brilliant and I absolutely adore it.<br/><br/>The action is awesome in this movie. The car chase scene, the police station sequence, the masterpiece that is the climax; these are all truly great scenes that elevate this movie above the rest. They lack the fun aspect that most other action movie's possess but that doesn't make it any less awesome.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie enough. Comparing the tone of this review and the rating may imply that my rating was too harsh but the flaws I mentioned earlier on are my only genuine flaws with this movie. I cannot flaw this movie any more and it is truly excellent. I highly recommend you see this movie. I'll rate it 8 'I'LL BE BACKS' out of 10."

","""The Terminator"" is director James Cameron's big ticket into the world of film, and rightfully so. He's put together an interesting, partly paranoid, gritty survival Sci-Fi Action mesh that ought to be rated highly given the apparent modest budget. While lead actress Linda Hamilton's gives a soft and maybe somewhat uneven performance, Cameron scores largely due to choosing Schwarzenegger for the lead villain. An article states Cameron was against casting Arnold initially, but the planned rejection-meeting changed and reversed his mind, and the rest is history. The action in the movie fairly competent. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is the back-story which is a great setup and give the movie some depth. Rewatching it, I hadn't seen in it in 15 years, but it is still a good watch minus the scene-cutover music which doesn't stand the test of time and makes and dates it sounding circus- like and cartoonish. You can forgive this though. Note Michael Biehn does solid job in supporting role. Recommended Sci-Fi, and certainly for Arnie fans -- 7/10."

","Some may say, ""come on, you're kidding"", but the truth is, aside from time travel, everything this movie predicted is coming true technology-wise. Robots, AI, drones, the internet, etc. Skynet...Google? It could actually happen.<br/><br/>That, aside from Arnold and its totally solid plot and action, is why this movie and (some of) its sequels became so successful. It is almost entirely possible that this could happen. <br/><br/>Having watched a lot of sci-fi, I can't think of anything else that predicted this accurately what kinds of technology would be developed in the future. <br/><br/>Aside from that, the movie is kind of a standard thriller with a killer on the loose, but it's done very well. The budget may have been a little bit thin, but the premise and execution by James Cameron are excellent. This is his best movie, before he got pretentious."
"room102","10","0","1","9 October 2015"," Still remains one of the best movies ever made
","I know it by heart, but haven't seen it in ages.<br/><br/>Brilliant. Just brilliant film. James Cameron is a genius - was and still is one of the best filmmakers of our time. While some of the effects dated a bit (the terminator face surgery always seemed fake to me, even when watching it as a kid, but I still liked it then and like it now) and are more obvious when watching the movie in HD instead of a VHS (most notably the rear projection effects), this movie remains an achievement for its time and budget and still holds to this day the same effect it had 30 years ago.<br/><br/>Fantastic combination of vision, effects, writing, direction, cinematography, score and production. Good acting by the entire cast.<br/><br/>I'm curious as for why Cameron chose to reveal the ""terminator view"" when he did and didn't save it up for a bit later. It's hard for me to judge, having watched this movie so many times, but wouldn't it have been better not to show it at that scene and let the audience wonder whether Kyle is really telling the truth or just making up stuff?"
"andrewplord","7","0","4","13 June 2015"," Fun to be had, but...
","No-one is going to deny that there is a lot of excitement and fun to be had here, but there are gaping plot holes ( a time travel plot will do that I suppose) and some pretty terrible writing. (""In the short time we had together we loved enough for a lifetime"" is one notable stinker) But can we mention a couple of things.<br/><br/>1) The soundtrack. Surely the least effective collection of '80's synthesiser sounds trying to sound portentious ever recorded. Really a shocker. It clanks and plonks along with little connection to what's happening on screen and sounding like it was recorded in a barn. Horrible.<br/><br/>2) Who was responsible for Linda Hamilton's hair? Sure it was the '80s, but seriously her hair looks like something a cocker spaniel might reject. And then it gets messed up and she gets it redone in the same style, just to prove it was deliberate. There's no excuse.<br/><br/>3) The special effects... yes, I know the movie was done on the same amount as the catering budget Cameron used for Avatar, but even so, those effects where Arnie is pulling out his eyeball are a nonsense, they must be the least effective pipe bombs in history and the metal skeleton at the end - well, don't get me started on the metal skeleton. Ray Harryhausen could make an army of skeletons look believable and even charming in Jason and the Argonauts, but this thing is pretty damn lame.<br/><br/>I suspect that when people say ""I love the Terminator movies"", what they really mean is ""I love Terminator 2"" - a rip snorter, exciting, innovative movie. If ever there was a movie series that came into its own with the sequel it's this one."
"willcundallreview","7","0","2","11 June 2015"," A bit of Sci-fi classic film
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>The Terminator, the name emits a kind of weird thought of Arnold Schwarzenegger or maybe the name John Connor(usually pronounced in an Austrian accent). Whatever Terminator themed thing that comes to mind, this film will no doubt leave you feeling well enjoyed and engaged, in a way that many action films just fail to do. <br/><br/>The film is interesting, and again you don't always get that from action movies but the Sci-fi is good enough to combine with the good action to make this exciting and very fun. I found this intriguing in a sense, the story is kind of predictable then also un- predictable at the same time, and that makes it both humorous yet very serious and the suspense is well done too. The ending is the best part about this, this gets better as it goes along and for me the very end is one of the most exciting moments in this entire movie.<br/><br/>You know Arnie is the best remembered actor of this film, but not for good reason, sure he is good but don't forget about the others here though. Michael Biehn is firm as Kyle and he makes the serious moments, just that bit more serious. Linda Hamilton isn't always great here, probably the weakest of the main ""good guys"" but she still acts kind of well, just maybe not the best for a leading actor. The cast is picked well there is no doubt here but Arnie to be fair is the real memorable person, he commands his scenes and the lines he is given are at times, gold.<br/><br/>Now James Cameron I do feel is overrated here, I know I know how do I think he Is overrated but let me get this out straight, although he is good, as is the film as a whole, I don't think it is a masterpiece. Now Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd create a script that is solid, and it works out well, but I do feel his directing can be a little too, well crash and bang, sometimes scenes get a little too fast and the fighting is too quick to be seen, although all together as said before, he is good.<br/><br/>Why do I think this isn't a masterpiece?, well it comes down to this, now it is unique it's way of being made however, I watched this years later, I have been influenced by other films, so maybe to fully love this, you'd have to go back to 84. I do though, feel this is special, in a way in which this plot is still to this day, never been re done to a good quality, and I mean that because Sci-fi films want to emulate this, but they can't or people will know.<br/><br/>The fast pacing of this movie makes this easy to like, and it is important because again, not so many action films do this well or make the action fast but well made(but as previously mentioned, not all the action is seamless). The Special effects are a little crazy at times, when the movie starts to go to the future, the space ships are insane and the props are actually kind of funny, of course effects weren't as good in the 80's so a bit of credit to the team behind.<br/><br/>All together though I do find this good and although maybe my rating doesn't reflect my full opinion on this, it still tells this is a film nearly everyone likes, even if just a little. It is hard to hate this movie I admit, I mean I didn't try but finding holes in this is fruitless, just sit back and enjoy a bit of movie history."

","Cameron was stuck in Rome in the early eighties editing Piranha II: The Spawning; a film that he was not even supposed to be working on. During the late nights in the editing room Cameron started to dream of an image of a robotic skeleton emerging from a massive explosion. He took that idea home with him and while waiting for his paycheck from Piranha II, he and his future wife future wife Gale Anne Hurd developed a story around the image.<br/><br/>If only I could turn some of my crazy dreams into a multi million dollar franchise. Any type of decent sci fi story that was inspired by a dream or a nightmare is pretty cool in my book. You've gotta respect a guy who trusts his vision enough to see it through all the rejection they went through to get that film made."
"robsta23","8","0","2","6 April 2015"," ""I'll be Back"" makes me Excited to Watch Judgment Day Again
","This is a good science-fiction movie, and I especially like the paradox which involves the birth and existence of John Connor. Arnold Schwarzenegger is good as the titular character since his role calls for the acting skills he can provide: the acting skills needed for a robot.<br/><br/>The premise is simpler than I expected it to be: kill Sarah Connor to prevent the birth of a hero named John Connor. Sadly, there is not much characterization coming from Sarah Connor until the last few minutes of the movie. It is disappointing that the focus of the film is on Schwarzenegger since poor special effects make up the terminator's face once he tears his own eyeball out.<br/><br/>Sadly this film is nowhere on the same scale as the sequel, but I guess being made 7 years earlier, this movie was bound to have lesser special effects than the 2nd one. But it is not just the special effects; like Alien being compared to Aliens, this film just has less action due to less extras (in this case, less police) than the sequel, which makes for a less exciting adventure movie.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the movie, but I don't see all the fuss about why this is so iconic. I have more interest in the characters as well as the action in Judgment Day. Finally, I have to say it is really cool how The Terminator is both on the top 50 villains and top 50 heroes lists according to AFI."

","""The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present. Tonight..."" <br/><br/>Earth's future is a grim one where the landscape is a wasteland and our own technology has backfired and created super-intelligent cyborgs and machines capable of thinking on their own and who've all but taken over the planet. In fact, by 2027 the world looks like one huge junkyard where aircraft fire purple and blue lasers into the night sky and large tanks roll around crushing scrap metal and skulls. The last surviving humans on the planet are in the midst of a losing war, but find a savior in John Connor, who will eventually save mankind. Unfortunately, the machinery have also managed to master the form of time travel and thus have another trick up their sleeve to prevent John from even coming into this world.<br/><br/>A naked, muscular man (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his star-making role) suddenly appears out of nowhere in a flash of lightning somewhere in Los Angeles, present day. First things first, he needs some clothes and gets them from a trio of punks after sending his fist all the way through one of them. Then it's off to pawn shop to load up on shotguns, Uzis and ammo. No need to pay: just shoot the clerk. From there, a quick glance at the phone book reveals there are three Sarah Connor's living in the city and, since this man isn't actually a man at all but an emotionless humanoid cyborg sent there with one goal in mind, he gets to work hunting each of the ladies down and exterminating them, for one is the future mother of John Connor. Appearing somewhere else in L.A. is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn); a flesh-and-blood human this time, and a good guy, who's there to try to prevent the Terminator from accomplishing his goal.<br/><br/>After quickly dispatching the first two Sarah's and numerous other people who get in the way, the terminator finally manages to track down the third - and correct - Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in a club at about the same time as Kyle. Kyle manages to get her out of there in one piece (can't say the same for many of the other patrons) and from then on out it's an action-packed, fast-paced pursuit through the city with car chases, shootouts and explosions aplenty as our heroes try to think of a way to kill an unstoppable killing machine that seems impervious to most kinds of conventional weaponry. One of the best sequences is when the terminator shoots up dozens of cops at a police station, which also happens to contain the famous line ""I'll be back."" Seeing this movie first as a kid in the late 80s and now again as an adult, I can say it's held up well over the years thanks to strong storytelling and despite any advances in fx technology.<br/><br/>Made on a budget of just 6.4 million dollars, the film became one of the year's surprise hits; grossing 38 million in the U.S. alone (nearly 80 million worldwide). Though that doesn't seem like a whole lot nowadays, the film's reputation grew throughout the decade and by the time Cameron returned with T2 in 1991, the budget had skyrocketed to 100+ million and the film grossed double that, making it the #1 box office draw of its year. TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003) boasted a price tag somewhere between 170 and 200 million dollars and did better overseas than in the U.S. Ditto for the Schwarzenegger-free, 200-million-budgeted TERMINATOR SALVATION (2009). There was also the TV series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,"" which lasted two seasons, and an upcoming fifth film in the franchise is coming in 2015.<br/><br/>Because the screenplay shared numerous ideas from several Harlan Ellison stories, the author ended up suing. It was settled out of court and Ellison received a special thanks acknowledgment in the end credits."

","Title: The Terminator <br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: A robot assassin is sent back in time to kill the mother of a future resistance leader <br/><br/>Notable Acting: This movie had a great cast of actors who would be known for this movie for the rest of their careers. The secondary character were also great and added to the story as a good secondary character should. <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: I do not need to say that there will be no interesting or unique shots in this movie, mainly because it is an 80's movie and movies weren't all too interested in showing us their ability to use their camera in unique ways until the 2000s <br/><br/>Costume: The actor playing the Terminator may not blend in, but his punk clothing sure does blend into the punk scene<br/><br/>Incorrect Science: The Terminator buys an automatic Uzi at one point. I may be from a country which has a choke hold on owning firearms, but I know that fully automatic weapons are illegal in America and that any gun store selling fully automatic weapons wouldn't have them up on a wall. The paradox of Kyle being John's father along with the cliché of the woman getting pregnant after the first time they've had sex (I know it's possible, but it's still a cliché) Kyle points out that Terminators are suppose to blend in, this doesn't work when you have a body builder with a thick foreign accent playing the role. ""Only living things can go through the teleporter"" This works good for this movie, but not for the second movie when the Terminator is liquid metal with no skin.<br/><br/>Overall Feel: This is the movie which elevated the knowledge of its main actors, before this movie only a hand full of people would know Arnold as he played Conan a couple years before, it is a similar story for the other two main actors. But this movie made their names known. Sadly I cannot say that this movie is my favourite, as that goes to Terminator 2, but this was the movie that set the wheels in motion for the franchise. The idea for the Terminator was actually take from a book outside of the franchise which also involved time travel assassinations and was credited."

","The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies.<br/><br/>The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic.<br/><br/>The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be ""bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.""<br/><br/>The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger).<br/><br/>As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes.<br/><br/>The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel.<br/><br/>The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it.<br/><br/>Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>I give this 8 stars out of 10."

","The Terminator is a movie with a complex background that manages to deliver a simple yet strong story by staying true to the characters. Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional.<br/><br/>The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. <br/><br/>Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for.

The stop motion animation is good, but nowadays, it's an old technology. The mechanical puppet doesn't have human fluidity it should have. The latex stand-in is pitiful by today's standard.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. Everyone should see it because it's a landmark, especially sci-fi fans."

","I didn't know James Cameron wrote and directed The Terminator, can't say that I'm surprised because only a genius could have created it. The Terminator is early on in Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron's careers' and this movie put them on the map, or at least made them bigger stars. James Cameron created a world of time travel and the inevitable end of the world with a war between humanity and machines. What could possibly go wrong? The answer is nothing.<br/><br/>Arnold plays the terminator, a emotionless, flat, cyborg, killing machine that has one goal, terminate. Arnold was a perfect role. He obviously has his accent and amazing physique and he probably has fifty lines in the movie and he is intimidating. The special effects done to his face when he is part human and part machine is done really well. The only flaw in the effects is the shots when the actual machine is walking on a green screen. In all honesty it looked awful and took me out of the experience but for its time it was acceptable. The character terminator itself was scary and godlike to say the least and the only reason this movie wasn't a ridiculous robot going on a killing rampage was the story behind it. In the year 2029, or something close to it, a man named John Connor is the leader of the human revolution and he gets word of a terminator going back in time to kill Sarah Connor, John's mother, to prevent John from being born. OK, so let's start with the idea of time travel. Brilliant, I love it. It makes me think and wonder what happens next. I could go on a rant and rave about time travel and how it messes on my mind but that's for another day. John Connor has a counter and sends one of his best men, Kyle Reece, to the past to protect Sarah Connor. Throughout the movie Reece gives bits and pieces as to what happens in the future and how the machines take over humanity. The bits and pieces were awesome, it didn't overwhelm me with information and it kept me invested in the story. The back story is incredible and the universe James Cameron created is commendable. The only real downside to the story is the lack of characters. Reece is a good character but I wasn't a huge fan. His acting was a little flat and I wasn't fully invested n his character. There was something about him that rubbed me the wrong way. The action in the move was really cool. The Terminator is basically invincible so seeing Arnold get shot rapidity and watching him throw people through windows was awesome. The car chases were done well and the best scene was easily when the terminator tears through the police station and says the famous line, ""I'll be back."" Nobody realized it then but that quote is imitated by everybody at least once in their life, even if they haven't seen the movie. Arnold's voice and the way he acts on screen is so unusual but effective. This thing clearly isn't human and Arnold does it perfectly. People may disagree with me on this but I'm saying it now, Arnold as the first Terminator is better than the T-1000. I really liked the character Sarah Connor. She is the most important character and she is portrayed really well. She is a normal girl with a normal life just trying to get by. She is a waitress and a lot of people can relate to that. As 'm writing this now I am a waiter so I know. Sarah Connor is a character people sympathize with so nice work, Cameron; you know how to write a main character. The relationship between Reece and Sarah is cute to say the least. The way their relationship builds is very believable. If you have seen enough movies you can figure out the end of the movie and what happens to each character but when I first saw it I had no idea what was going to happen. Looking back I should have figured it out but that's the magic of movies. Overall, The Terminator is a classic in my opinion. I loved the movie and the depth behind the story. Arnold was born to play this role and James Cameron was born to make brilliant movies. The two of them together is a powerhouse that couldn't possibly fail. The Terminator without a doubt gets the WillyT Seal of Approval."

"compi24","8","0","1","8 September 2011"," Review Of ""The Terminator""
","I honestly don't think that this movie needs an introduction, but I'll give it one anyway - ""The Terminator"" is a 1984 film crafted by legendary filmmaker James Cameron. The film follows tells the story of a cyborg assassin (Schwarzenegger) who is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill a young woman (Hamilton). Well, starting from the top, the movie's premise is certainly bizarre and outlandish, though Cameron and team seem to successfully transcend this obstacle by presenting the film's plot with utmost realism and seriousness. Quite possibly the greatest aspect of the film is, in fact, Arnold Schwarzenegger's truly menacing portrayal of the titular character. I wouldn't go so far as to say that this was a difficult performance, but Arnold pulls off one of his earliest acting roles with an intense amount of menace. The action sequences were also a masterstroke aspect of the film. Nearly every set piece in the film contained a good dose of thrills and jaw-dropping moments. The movie itself is, arguably, one of the greatest and most revolutionary science fiction films in film history. ""The Terminator"" was one of the first films to introduce the concept of self-aware artificial intelligence to the big screen, it catapulted the careers of Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron to new heights, and simultaneously introduced several memorable lines of dialogue that most people are familiar with. In 2008 ""The Terminator"" was selected by the Library Of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Did it deserve this honor? I believe so. For, ""The Terminator"" was a fun, intelligent, novel film for me to experience."
"Big_Bright_Green_Movie_Machine","9","0","1","9 July 2011"," In the year 1984, a classic was made. Like no other, this was ""The Terminator""
","Arnold Schwarzenegger, what can you say of the man? He has appeared in the worst of the worst, yet he slowly climbed to fame. His most memorable franchise is no doubt ""The Terminator"" franchise. The film is directed by James Cameron and he truly brings the screen to life. You can feel what the characters are feeling. Fear, excitement, and hope.<br/><br/>The films soundtrack is also the most fitting soundtrack for a movie besides ""The Graduate"" soundtrack. It's a dark soundtrack just like the movie. The film takes place in 1984, where Kyle Reese travels back in time to save Sarah Conner from a future machine. A improbable relationship blossoms between Reese and Sarah as they battle the machine. I don't want to give away and plot twists, so I won't go into any more detail. The action is awesome, and the effects are way ahead of its time.<br/><br/>This sci-fi film is on par with Star Wars. ""The Terminator"" has its little charm that no other film will ever have. Not even its sequels. Although ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is perhaps even better than the 1st movie. I am aware of the T.V. show, I have seen several episodes and the show does not even come close to this film. If you don't have this movie, you need to close your browser, use the most convenient transportation device, ride to your local video store. Find the film and take it to the cashier. Hand the cashier how ever much money it costs. Take the film with you and return to your house. Put the film in a DVD-Player/VHS player. And watch the film, it's that good!"

","This movie, like Die Hard, was one of the films I simply did not watch growing up. I was born in the era, but for some reason or another didn't find the urge to give in. That is until 2011.<br/><br/>Though I thought it was good, I'm not quite sure Terminator lived up to its reputation. I mean, the stop-motion special effects disappointed me and the lack of action in the beginning was a little off-putting. Also, the storyline seemed to stretch a little bit. But I guess that happens when you deal with a time travel in a movie. It takes a little extra concentration to get everything straight.<br/><br/>I did, however, enjoy most of the film. The action scenes were well-choreographed and the tension was high during the Terminators' ruthless massacre. The acting was above average and the dialog was nothing special, but good.<br/><br/>All-in-all, The Terminator wasn't a masterpiece but it was entertaining...and that's all you can ask for I guess. I hear the second installation released in 1991 is much better. And oh yeah, I've since seen Die Hard."

","It's hard to believe that the original Terminator film was James Cameron's first big budget Hollywood effort, well unless you count Piranha 2: The Spawning.<br/><br/>As I do.<br/><br/>While hundreds of 80s films now gather dust in cupboards and shelves across the planet housed neatly in brittle plastic VHS boxes – guys throw them out, it's not coming back! – some films carry on to be repackaged and repurchased in ever more pointless formats and editions. Check out the ""We mean it this time; Ultimate Edition"", or my favourite (and 100% real): TOTAL RECALL – Single Disc Edition!! Suffer all those guys who foolishly bought the 2 disc version. Losers! So I think by now with the prequels, sequels, threequels and nyquils that two visitors from the future are sent back to change or preserve the future, depending on what side you're on.<br/><br/>The first is about 6 foot 5, nude and built like a heart with a head and legs, and when he asks you for your clothes just give 'em to him, it will lengthen your life expectancy.<br/><br/>The second guy is an average guy that just seems skinny and scrawny by comparison to the living tissue over metal exoskeleton guy, that may be because he isn't 85% titanium and doesn't have a CPU in his head, or it may be because Michael Beihn went to acting lessons instead of the gym I guess we'll never know.<br/><br/>Now the second guy is the good guy, his name is Kyle Reese, he knows the son of the woman targeted for termination by the other big metal guy, despite the fact that she isn't yet a mother – or even pregnant. That chickie is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), and she works happily in a local fast food restaurant and lives with her ditzy flatmate and a giant lizard Wait, wait, wait Wait.<br/><br/>WAIT! None of this is important. What matters is just how cool all of this was then, and remarkably how cool it still is over 25 years later.<br/><br/>The makeup effects on the damaged T1000 (Arnie as the bad-robot) are awesome, and you totally forgive the fact that in a couple scenes it is obviously an animatronic head when you realise that it still looks really cool. Other scenes though that are definitely Arnold and you could swallow the fact that half his face is peeled off and he is filled with metal. The use of flashbacks – which are actually flashforwards to the future – are all realised spectacularly, especially when you understand just how low the budget was and how low-tech some of the tricks they used at the time (Yes I watched the special features), and once Arnie the exterior is gone and the shiny and gleaming robot version of him mercilessly and relentlessly continues its dogged pursuit of Connor it is still awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>All this before I even mention that the guy teased for being so robotic through his career is actually playing the robot. Arnie must have loved this role, they actually told him to be more wooden than normal, so instead of long speeches and pages of dialogue he gets to spit out maybe 15 lines of dialogue in the whole film and one of them turned out to be his own personal catchphrase even though James Cameron wrote it for him! Well I'm out of exclamation points, suffice to say if you're hanging around waiting for the next Alien Vs Predator, or you're lamenting how The Expendables just wasn't that rocking and you haven't seen The Terminator? Arise Sir Knight and head immediately to the video store (if it still exists) post-haste to rectify your oversight.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. A pretty simple story is laid out over an elaborate framework, then given a brilliant backstory. Add some superior SFX and a mono-syllabic Austrian bodybuilder and you've got yourself a timeless classic."

","Plot: A cyborg was sent to the past from a post apocalyptic future where humankind is fighting self-aware machines. His mission: the termination of Sarah Connor, the future mother of the human resistance leader. Her only hope for survival is a human soldier that was also sent back to the past to protect her.<br/><br/>You'll love The Terminator if: You want a very good Sci-Fi\Action\Thriller film with good characters that will keep you on the edge of your seat. What I love in The Terminator is that instead of cardboard characters that pose for the camera it has very good realistic characters that get hurt, are always very afraid and very, very vulnerable. Especially Sarah Connor is a real character that changes throughout the film and while Linda Hamilton who portrays her isn't exactly a hottie she shows us that its better to have charisma than a supermodel trying to act, something very common nowdays when it comes to female protagonists. Unlike the sequels the T-800 in this movie is ready to kill you without a second thought. If it grabs you you're dead! If he shoots at you and you aren't covered you're dead! It never stops, it never gets tired and will make you feel the tension of the characters. Finally while The Terminator has some plot holes and logic gaps, (mostly time travel paradoxes), it doesn't offend the intelligence of the viewers.<br/><br/>You'll hate The Terminator if: You wanted a more Sci-Fi oriented film rather than an action one or if you wanted something ""louder"" and with a bit of comedy thrown in. The first movie is nothing like T2 or T3 where 2/3's of the movie is all about loud explosions and slightly humorous situations. The chase scenes while very intense are simple they are just chase scenes and not a redecoration of a whole city!!! The Terminator is a way darker film where humor is non-existent when in T2 or T3 you would actually laugh with some of the scenes involving the T-800. Also while the plot is considered Science Fiction there is a greater deal of Action here than actual Sci-Fi stuff<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Great Sci-Fi\Action\Thriller\Chase film (7.7/10)<br/><br/>[+] Nicely directed. Great Action\Thriller atmosphere. Wonderful acting from Hamilton who portrays a ""real"" evolving character.<br/><br/>[-] A bit slow paced at times. Not for ""Hardcore"" Action or Sci-Fi fans. Not a movie you'll see more than 2-3 times.<br/><br/>Also Check: Alien (1979) - Predator (1987) – Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) – War Of The Worlds (2005)<br/><br/>P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say ""I like\don't like this movie"" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO..."

","Is it heresy to suggest that The Terminator may be a tad overrated? That perhaps fans who so love the whole Terminator saga and mythology remember the original film as being a little better than it actually was? This low budget sci-fi action thriller is certainly an enjoyable film. And considering the franchise it spawned and all the other films it so obviously influenced it's also an important film. But does that necessarily make it a truly great film? Probably not. It's a good film, very good in spots, but there are enough things holding it back to leave it a touch shy of greatness.<br/><br/>By now most everyone knows the film's story so a plot rehash seems rather unnecessary. In a nutshell a cyborg Terminator is sent back from the future to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of the as yet unborn human resistance leader who in that post-apocalyptic future will lead the fight against the machines which seek to exterminate humanity. Convoluted? You bet. Of course the Terminator has not come from the future alone. Human resistance fighter Kyle Reese has been sent back to protect Sarah. He must stop the unstoppable Terminator. Good luck with that. Shootouts and car chases and explosions ensue. Plot? Story? Dialogue? Sorry, don't have much for you here. But have I mentioned the explosions? Everyone likes seeing things get blown up right?<br/><br/>As I've implied, after the story initially sets itself up there really isn't much of a story at all. The whole movie is one big chase. Certainly there are moments of great excitement but in between the big moments...well there's often not much. At times things are rather sluggish. But there's enough good stuff here to make this at least an enjoyable flick if not some kind of all-time classic film. Of course there are some very memorable characters starting with the Terminator himself (itself?), played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. As a stiff, robotic, inhuman, largely mute killing machine Schwarzenegger's perfect. I'm not sure if that says much for Schwarzenegger's acting ability but for this role in this movie who could be better? The Terminator doesn't have much to say but whenever he does speak you remember it. Seriously, it seems every line Arnold speaks in the movie turned into a catchphrase. Sarah Connor is a character who undergoes a serious evolution in the course of the film and Linda Hamilton portrays that wonderfully. From the sweet, innocent girl at the film's beginning to something else entirely by film's end Hamilton traces the character's journey terrifically. Schwarzenegger and Hamilton are remembered best but it may actually be Michael Biehn who gives the best performance of all as Kyle Reese. It is left to his character to explain to Sarah, and by extension to us, what the heck this movie is actually about. No small task that, making a truly preposterous, unbelievable story sound convincing. Now if you stop and think about that story you will realize there are plot holes large enough to drive an exploding tanker truck through. Time travel stories have their own peculiar issues. Paradoxes and all that. And this film's got a doozy of a paradox. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. Even if it's not truly as great as it is generally remembered to be what it is ain't bad at all."

And Arnold Swartzenegger career for that sake, although he had made two movies prior to this, but this kinda put him on the ""map"". Also it's cool to see him as the bad guy, and not the invincible hero. i know it's a bit ironic as he is an almost invincible cyborg here, but it fits better for a foe rather than a friend. hero's need to struggle, while the enemy seem almost impossible to kill. It builds up tension, and this movie is packed with it.<br/><br/>I don't think I neither need or should tell the plot. it's about a robot trying to prevent a person to be born, so he goes back in time to kill his mother. That's about it, unless you want details, but then I advise you to see the movie instead.<br/><br/>The effects are great, especially considering it's budget; US$6.5 million. Not much for Hollywood standards, and it hardly shows. Even though some times the robot is a stop-motion effects, and the terminators's eye looks a little fake, it's nothing you really should bother to point out. It's from 1984, has a small budget, and it's about a cyborg killer, I'm impressed by what James Cameron achieved in this film.<br/><br/>I really look forward to see Terminator 2, and sadly I saw the third one first.

","One of the most amazing aspects of 'The Terminator,' was the story. Despite the extremely low budget, and the equally low-budget feel of the film, the movie had an extremely well thought out story. This is evident when they took this film into three additional sequels, made a mega-star out of Schwarzenegger and even produced a short-lived TV series. Unfortunately, despite the quality of story and the sci-fi aspect of the plot line, I viewed it more as a horror story than an action picture it was meant to be. I think it was the genre of films produced back on and around 1984. Only this one stood out, with solid performances by Hamilton, Biehn and, of course, Schwarzenegger. In the defining movie based on man vs. machines (tell me the makers of 'The Matrix' wasn't thinking about this movie throughout), comes a 'Judgment Day' apocalyptic war when machines take over in 1997 and man spends the rest of his days fighting the mistake we made. Back in time comes a ""terminator"" to kill the mother of the resistance leader in a valid tactical move, but thankfully, the leader also sends someone back to protect her – giving us valuable information in the process. While some of the graphics (and hair, oh, God, the hair) were extremely dated (also see: the closing, when Schwarzenegger finally loses his skin), the movie holds up very well, even 25 years later. And it's all thanks to the interesting and original story as well as the acting. Many imitated this movie; none came close to the heart of 'The Terminator.' I even loved the ending. Of course, it opened the doors to sequels, but if it ended with the storm coming, it would've been okay. They produced a quality product that honestly didn't need a continuation."

The Terminator's mission is to terminate Sarah Connors, Linda Hamilton, who's yet unborn son John will start a human uprising against the super intelligent machines who are destroying what's still left, in 2029, of the human race.<br/><br/>As we as well as Sarah soon learn from time traveler Kyle Reese, Michael Biehn, a human freedom fighter and John Connors' top commander who's also sent back from the future-2029-that it's of the utmost importance for her to survive in order to give birth to John who's to lead a revolt and defeat the future machines which he in fact did. Sending the Terminator to kill Sarah is the only way the machines can checkmate John's destruction of them and it's his job, by any means necessary, to murder her in order to prevent that from happening!<br/><br/>Non-stop action with the Terminator hell bent to murder Sarah and Reese doing his best to prevent that from happening. In his single-minded effort to rub out Sarah The Terminator spears no effort in arming himself to the teeth by knocking off a sporting goods store, and murdering its owner, as he goes out hunting for Sarah Connors in L.A and its surrounding suburbs. As things turn out the Terminator checking out the local L.A telephone book ends up murdering two other women with the identical name of Sarah Connors before he finally tracks down the one that he's really looking for at a local L.A disco. It's just then that Reese shows up and with shotgun blazing keeps the Terminator from completing his murderous mission.<br/><br/>On the run from the police as well as the Terminator Reese and Sarah end up trapped by the killer cyborg at a deserted factory who by now, with all the bullets and bombs he's absorb, is nothing but a shell, with his outer plating or human features all but obliterated, of his former self!<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** Explosive final sequence with the Terminator taring up the entire factory to get to both Sarah and Reese but ending up like the pile of junk-nuts & bolts and computer chips-that he at first started out as when he was created, or manufactured, back in 2029 by his masters and fellow nuts & bolts people the artificially intelligent machines! The mindless murderous and disrespectful,to the laws of man as well as nature, robotic brute was in the end himself terminated by the very person or persons, Sarah & Reese, who's lives he was out to extinguish with a super large dose of ""Terminal Justice""! As for Sarah she in fact did survive to give birth, out of wedlock, to her both future son and rebel hero John Connors. Knowing what the future holds Sarah is now making sure, via audio recordings and letters, that her soon to be born son will be ready for the monumental task, after a nuclear war started by the machines, that's awaiting him in the not so distant future: As the ""Savior"" of the ""Human Race""!"

","I saw this film in the cable channel listings last night, and by the time I finished debating whether to watch it or not, it was already fifteen minutes into the movie. I'd seen it before of course, and more than once, but I always have a fascination for films that struck me as groundbreaking when I saw them upon their original release. So I tuned in, and my review here has more to do with the perspective of twenty five years having passed since that Orwellian year of 1984.<br/><br/>First off, I enjoy the movie, no two ways about it. If you can take Dr. Silberman's (Earl Boen) word for it, Reese's story is brilliant. But even back then, a quarter decade ago, I just couldn't buy the sheer illogic of the story's main plot element. The son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back in time to prevent The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenneger) from killing the waitress who's son would lead the resistance against the machines in the year 2029. Now you can only take the 'chicken or the egg' argument so far. Even Sarah Connor realized this by the end of the story when she said it made her head hurt. As laid out, this story couldn't have happened, and yet it stands as one of the most memorable sci-fi flicks of all time.<br/><br/>And that's OK. I give the picture high marks for it's relentless pace and the innovative ways the Cyberdine System Model 101 (that would be Arnold) found to hunt down it's quarry. By today's technology and special effects, the picture appears somewhat dated, as does Ridley Scott's ""Alien"", but that can't be helped any more than the constraints on an earlier era's ""War of the Worlds"" (1953) or ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" (1951). Even the skeletal half-Terminator of the film's finale, which clearly screamed Harryhausen, managed to effectively engage this viewer in the desperate struggle for survival and victory. This adventure wouldn't be over until that single red eye went dark, not in a blaze of glory, but in the suffocating gray defeat of all it's hunter-killer instinct.<br/><br/>Hard to say which Sarah Connor I prefer - the buffed and muscular Linda Hamilton of the sequel, or the soft and indecisive, almost clueless Sarah of the original. Therein lies the opportunity for the growth of the character over the course of the story arc. One needs to follow it through.<br/><br/>One thing I realized today though, and it took twenty five years to come to it, but the title of this film is ""The Terminator"". I think when you're dealing with someone as huge as 'Mr. Universe' and 'Mr. Olympia' on the world bodybuilding stage, there's no room for defining the protagonist with the article 'The'. In my book, this film will always be ""Terminator""."
"alienworlds","Null","0","2","22 August 2009"," Its a period piece to me somehow
","...the same way other films somehow seemed to sum up the hopes and fears of a particular generation. Not really much in the way of special effects, and the script is sort of basic, but it works on the level of a good SF film nonetheless. Maybe because it uses the idea of time travel. There were a number of sequels, which all seemed to add to the original idea, with the possible exception of the fourth film which creates so many complexities to that particular time travel experience the whole thing becomes incomprehensible in terms of the logic of that particular time travel time line. It ends up being I am my own grandpa type of thing. Anyway Linda Hamilton is good as the female lead in Terminator, and Arnie says, well, just about three words in the entire film. A good film to see if you are bored on a summer night. I think everybody can identify with the fear of The End Of The World given the ultra armed state of things, so in that way the film addresses that issue, albeit in a way that involves time travel and machines running amok. I think I can't really give it an eight because of its kind of cheap model special effects."

A soldier is sent back in time to protect her. But it turns out that he not only protects her, he is the father of the future resistance leader. The first Terminator film is a classic. It doesn't make my favorites list, but it's sequel does. From the minute you see Arnold Swartzenegger on the screen, you know he was on roids.The other films I don't think he was. I don't like this one as much because I prefer the liquid guy as a villain over him. Arnold Swatzenegger isn't meant to be playing a villain in a film. He's always the hero. This film is a ton better than that ridiculous film Conan. Overall, the original Terminator film isn't my favorite, but it's not the worst."

","Ahh... James Cameron. One of the best directors ever. From this to Titanic, some of the best movies ever. But today I'll be reviewing one of his movies. The Terminator. This movie is one of the best. It is action paced and it actually works as a love story.SO! on to the main review. The main characters of this movie are Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn). They are pretty good characters and the actors just make it better. Kyle is kickass and Sarah is also awesome especially near the end. The main villain, of course all of you should know this by now, is The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). He is AWESOME! He doesn't have a personality but you can sort of get one OUT OF A FRICKIN ROBOT! He's just awesome that way. The supporting characters are basically the police lieutenant (Paul Winfield) and while he's on screen, he does a pretty good job! The action is just amazing. It kept you watching and the suspense could cut you like a knife. And finally, the story is actually kinda complicated but still good. A war in the future forces the robots to send a terminator to destroy the mother of their best fighter, John Connor. John then sends Kyle to protect his mother. Then the rest is running for a Arnoldinator. But it's more complicated than that which this is my only gripe. The story has what is popularly known as the Connor Paradox. If Kyle Reese is the father of John Connor since he made love to Sarah, then how was John able to send Kyle if he hadn't even existed? Was his father a different person before he sent Kyle and he thought Kyle was cooler so he sent him to be his father? MY HEAD! the story is my only gripe. But overall, I give The Terminator, 80% awesome."

","Terminator is truly a CLASSIC movie that even now still is enjoyable enough to watch. One of the better (maybe one of the best) sci-fi thriller movies.<br/><br/>It's hard to tell the story of Terminator in a few sentences, but here goes: a cyborg killing machine, called a Terminator, is send back in time (from a future in which mankind is almost destroyed completely by robots) to kill the mother of the rebellion leader. By doing so making sure that the robots will win in the future and not the humans. Right after the Terminator a human from the future arrives to stop the Terminator from completing it's mission.<br/><br/>Did you get all that? Movies involved with time travel tend to get very complex and difficult, but this is not the case with Terminator. The plot is great and moves at a steady pace. This movie has a really good script and the actors work very nicely with it.<br/><br/>They couldn't have picked a more suitable actor for the Terminator then Arnold. He plays one of his best characters in his career, in my opinion. There are so many memorable scenes and lines. In particular the one-liner: ""I'll be back"".<br/><br/>I can highly recommend this movie for fans of Sci-Fi and/or thriller movies. It's a very entertaining and sometimes even scary movie.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars!"
"poe426","10","0","1","24 May 2009"," The Outer Limits redux...
","When I saw this one in 1984, I couldn't help but point out that it was nothing new: anyone who's seen THE OUTER LIMITS (the original, black and white series) can attest to that. THE TERMINATOR ""borrows liberally"" from at least three episodes: THE MAN WHO WAS NEVER BORN, SOLDIER, and DEMON WITH A GLASS HAND. The latter two episodes were both written by noted Fantasist Harlan Ellison. He would sue the filmmakers for plagiarism and win. (When the movie played theaters, the ""acknowledgement to the works of Harlan Ellison"" did NOT appear at the end of the movie.) Cameron and company took the romance between Martin Landau and the soon-to-be mother of the man who would bring about the end of civilization from THE MAN WHO WAS NEVER BORN and coupled it, if you will, with the time-traveling title character from SOLDIER (brilliantly played by Michael Ansara) and the Mandroid (another brilliant performance, by Robert Culp) from DEMON WITH THE GLASS HAND. Focusing more on action than anything else (though it's Michael Bien's passionate performance as the hero that makes the movie worth watching), THE TERMINATOR proved the perfect vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger: he says little, but is physically imposing enough to intimidate anyone he comes into contact with. The fx were good enough for their time (and still hold up on the small screen) and the music is unforgettable."
"zardoz-13","8","0","1","23 May 2009"," The First Major Cinematic Cyborg Thriller of Them All!!!
","""Piranha 2: The Spawning"" director James Cameron scored his first major cinematic hit with ""The Terminator,"" a gritty, on-the-run, rough-hewn, low-budget science fiction actioneer about time travel with a curious twist. Body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger virtually guaranteed that this 107 minute exercise in murder and mayhem would be a blockbuster with his villainous, straight-faced portrayal of a relentless cyborg that will allow nothing to stand between its programmed objective of executing a woman, Sarah Connor, in the past. The chief science fiction element in Cameron's film is the use of predestination paradox where it appears the history is being altered, when in fact, it is really being fulfilled. Cameron rehashed much of the ""Terminator"" action in the sequel, but he made the Schwarzenegger more sympathetic by having him serve as young John Connor's bodyguard. Ironically, this $6-million plus movie wasn't that original because cyborg characters have been around in fantasy literature as early as Edgar Allan Poe. Nevertheless, ""The Terminator"" put cyborgs on the map more than ""The Six-Million Dollar Man"" and eventually inspired the ""Robocop"" franchise.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" opens in Los Angeles in 2029 A.D., at night while enemy Hunter Killer hovercraft prowl the post-apocalyptic rubble of the city for human prey. Heavy combat vehicles with massive treads on their wheels crush hundreds of human skulls into powder while human survivors exchange fire with skeletal metal terminators with fiery red eyes. A preamble of sorts comes up and sets the scene: The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here in our present . . . tonight. The actual story unfolds at 1:52 AM when a garbage truck driver watches crackling blue plasma-type waves envelope him and his vehicle.<br/><br/>A garbage truck operator is emptying trash bins when a plasma-like web of jagged blue lighting bolts envelopes his vehicle and shuts off the vehicle's power. He flees when the T-101 Terminator assassin (Arnold Schwarzenegger) appears naked out of nowhere. Skynet has sent the T-101 from the future back to the year 1984 to kill the mother of resistance leader John Connor. The naked t-101 saunters up to a trio of punks at the Griffith Park Observatory overlooking Los Angeles. An obnoxious, blue-haired punk (Bill Paxton of ""Aliens"" and ""Twister"") and his friend (veteran heavy Brian Thompson of ""Sudden Impact"" and ""Cobra"") ridicule T-101. The Terminator kills both of them while the third strips off his clothing. Meanwhile, elsewhere in L.A., another naked man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn of ""The Rock"") materializes from the future. He steals a homeless man's pants, evades the L.A.P.D., and breaks into a clothing store, steals Nike sneakers and a trench coat. Whereas the T-101 wants to kill Sarah, Kyle wants to save her! Not surprisingly, young Sarah Connor doesn't have a clue that anybody yearns to either murder her or save her life.<br/><br/>Sarah works at a fast-food restaurant. The T-101 finds three Sarah Connors in the L.A. phone book and kills the first two and then invades Sarah's apartment and kills her roommate Ginger and Matt (Rick Rossovich of ""Top Gun"") her boyfriend. Eventually, Sarah discovers what is happening and holes up at a night club called Tech Noir where the T-101 tracks her down. Kyle Reese rescues Sarah and they flee, but the L.A.P.D. capture them and Reese has to cough up his far-fetched story to a by pompous psychologist Dr. Peter Silberman (Earl Boen of ""Alien Nation"") who doesn't believe a syllable of Reese's saga. Silberman diagnoses Reese as suffering from paranoid delusions and boasts that he make a career out of analyzing the guy's stories. During Reese's interrogation scene at police headquarters with Silberman, Cameron and co-writers Gale Ann Hurd and an uncredited William Wisher, Jr., provide audiences with crucial expository information about Skynet and the war with the cyborgs that seek to annihilate mankind.<br/><br/>The bulk of ""The Terminator"" concerns the T-101's tireless efforts to kill Sarah while Reese struggles to lead her to safety. During their flight, Reese and Sarah become romantically involved and Reese gets Sarah pregnant with future resistance leader John Connor. Talk about twisted time travel?! Cameron intersperses a flashback to the future where a T-101 (Schwarzenegger's pal Franco Columbu of ""Beretta's Island"") invades a resistance bunker and goes on a murderous rampage before he is eliminated. Throughout the blazing action sequences, Cameron gradually strips the T-101 down to its alloyed metal endoskeleton. Reese explains to Silberman that a Terminator is a cyborg, half-man, and half-machine that will never stop until it kills Sarah. Everybody at the police station regards Reese as a fruit cake with his unbelievable story until the T-101 shows up with an arsenal of weapons and shoots up the premises, killing at least 17 cops. Reese and Sarah escape, hid out in a motel where they build pipe bombs, but the resourceful T-101 finds Sarah's mother, kills her off-screen, and imitates her so that it can learn Sarah's whereabouts. Another ramped up chase ensues with the T-101 caught in a blazing 18-wheeler. The fire scorches its entire body in the last 15 minutes so that all that remains is the skeleton. Reese dies blowing the skeleton in two. The torso of the T-101 continues to stalk Sarah until she crushes it in a tool manufacturing factory so that only the hand and forearm, which appears in the sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" James Cameron has more road trip action in this thriller than actual science fiction, but the action-packed scenes more than deliver their quota of thrills and chills. One of the earliest scenes in a pawnshop has the T-101 gathering an arsenal of hardware from an unsuspecting clerk (Dick Miller) and then killing him instead of paying for it. The ""I'll be back"" scene at the police station massacre is probably the best scene in this supercharged little spine-tingler."

","The film that made Cameron and Arnie into A listers holds up pretty well after 25 years, with exciting action sequences, laconic cops, a legendary one-liner and a powerful depiction of a post-apocalypse world devastated by nuclear war. In 1984, when the film came out, this still felt like something that might be just around the corner.<br/><br/>This is the very ideal of high concept - a cyborg from the future comes back to kill the mother of a future resistance leader, thus preventing the humans from defeating a powerful super-computer that's wiped out most of humanity. The premise is actually borrowed from a Harlan Ellison-scripted t.v. episode of The Outer Limits, and Cyborg 2087, a t.v. flick based on a novel by Martin Caidin, which also inspired The Six Million Dollar Man. Whew!<br/><br/>It's what Cameron does with it that matters. The movie holds your attention from the get-go and Arnie was never better as the soulless, murderous Terminator of the title. Michael Biehn gives a wonderful performance as a future resistance fighter sent back in time to prevent the killing. ""It's just him and me"" he says at one point. The time machine's been destroyed, stranding him in 1984, and his cause is something he's willing to die for. Yet Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen raise scene-stealing to an art-form as the two cops trying to fathom it all out. Stan Winstone's stop motion effects may have dated but they were state of the art at time the film was made, and Brad Fiedel's memorable pounding main theme will stay with you long after the credits have faded. This deserves to be counted with Star Wars and Blade Runner as one of the great sci-fi movies of its time."
"chilla-black","8","0","2","14 May 2009"," one of the best ever but still a couple of points to raise
","this is a brilliant film of course, but certain things do occur can put a deeper slant on the plot if you analyse it.<br/><br/>Firstly Kyle Reese's arrival in 1984 Los Angeles. We are given the insight in the opening sequences that the world he comes from has become a desolate hell, beyond imagination. So i find it a bit odd that he should not be overawed with the relative comfort of 1984 and suffer a spot of freaking out accordingly, not leg it into a department store and try on a pair of Nike Sneakers. Also some pussy would probably not go a miss either.<br/><br/>Then the line that always gets me is the ""Terminator is out there"" speech. OK fair enough but what if the Terminator had killed Sara Connor? What isn't explained is what would the Terminator do until 1997? I like to think he would possibly go on an extended vacation to Acapulco or something.<br/><br/>I also find the scenes where Sara's friend is having multiples listening to her Walkman to be a bit superficial as well, especially when she goes into the kitchen and starts drumming with some celery."
"clavery7","9","0","1","29 April 2009"," Great movie
","The Terminator was one of the films I watched growing up as it was made in the same year I was born and I remember finding it scary when I was younger, seeing killer robots with red eyes and teeth. I thought the next 2 sequels were just as good although Arnie now plays a goody even though he was a baddie in the 1st one. Cannot wait to see Terminator Salvation even though he isn't to star in it and it's disappointing that they killed Sarah Connor off before the 3rd film came out, she was one of the best characters and should have been kept in it. I'm not a big fan of the TV series but it is watchable, even though it's hardly like the film, the character Derek (Kyle Reese's brother) they were meant to have grew up after the war but you see that he is covered in tattoos. Did a tattoo parlour remain standing after the bombs went off? It's scary to think something like this could happen in real life cause of the kind of bombs that exist now and people are starting to make robots, not to sound crazy"
"presbp-1","9","0","1","16 April 2009"," Terminator is a great action film but it is also one that makes you think. That is what makes it better than a standard action film.
","While Terminator is a great action film, I was surprised and happy to see that James Cameron went to great lengths to give the film a soul as well. I was glad to see that there is actually character development in the film and that the characters weren't stamped ""helpless woman"", ""hero"", ""villain"". I was also very pleased that James Cameron made a conscientious effort to include minor details, that if not present in the film, would leave a few would-be plot holes in the story. The film, like most science fiction (or at least good science fiction appears to do), keeps us thinking about the implications of our use of technology.<br/><br/>There are a couple instances where I perceived the dialogue to be corny, forced and/or unnecessary. There were also a couple instances where I felt as if suspension of reality was required. Granted this is a sci-fi action film those two things still seemed far-fetched.<br/><br/>However, even though I had some minor issues with the film, the film was great. The film made me think, gave me an adrenaline rush and got me emotionally engaged in the events that were happening on screen. Perhaps I am exaggerating, but I feel as if it is rather rare that an action film has fairly good character development, makes you think or weaves the plot so well. I was thoroughly impressed."

","The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger), a seemingly indestructible and emotionless cyborg, is sent from the future to kill young Sarah Connor( Linda Hamilton), who holds the key to a future war. Kyle Reese( Michael Biehn), a young man who has grown up in the ruins and ashes of a destroyed world, is sent from the future to warn and protect her. Both The Terminator and Kyle have no intentions of failing their missions, but only one can succeed...<br/><br/>James Cameron's ""Terminator"" is a complex blend of classic science fiction, high octane action, and immense terror, glazed with style and deep with story. There are so many little things that make this movie great. I love the irony of the opening scenes: The Terminator, who has come to seek, to kill, and to destroy, does just this, all without alarming the local police. Kyle Reese, who has come to protect and serve, is soon being chased and hunted thy the police. Not long after, there is a scene where the ruthless Terminator steels a police car and adopts an officer's voice, essentially joining the police ranks, all to hunt down Kyle, who has become a wanted criminal. It's this helter skelter social commentary and pessimistic irony, that comprises the film's dark, gritty tone. It is interesting to note that this is a dark film, and the ""Terminator"" series has increasingly become more mainstream and child-friendly over the years, with a 'good guy' Terminator, child actors, and a possible pg-13 rating for the fourth film, Terminator: Salvation. The first film however, remains a dark and gritty little thriller.<br/><br/>The thing that makes ""The Terminator"", ""The Terminator"", is Schwarzenegger's performance as The Terminator. This is without a doubt the greatest performance I have ever seen from Schwarzenegger. Though some may mock and say "" He's only playing a robot, and he's only doing a good job because playing a mechanical being requires no acting"", Schwarzenegger does an incredible job that few top notch actors could pull off. In a word, The Terminator is scary, and most of what creates that sense of fear is Arnold's presence: his hulking, looming body, his mechanical gestures, his soulless facial expressions, his cold, emotionless voice. The Terminator is ruthless, cold, impossible to reason with, heartless. He feels no pain nor pity. He is a man made force that dedicates all to the mission at hand. When watching the film, I was reminded of the character of Michale Myers in John Carpenter's slasher ""Halloween"". Cold, ruthless, always in the shadows and ready to strike. Truly The Terminator is the Michale Myers of action films. And it is Arnold Schwarzenegger that makes us believe: makes us believe that he's out there, and he will find you, because thats what he does. That's all he does.<br/><br/>Opposing the one man(Err, machine?)army Terminator is a great cast of Jame's Cameron favorites. Michael Biehn does a knock out job as the scarred war-child from the future, I absolutely love his performance in this film. He has a sense of urgency and child like confusion emitting from him that fits not only his character and his development, but the story has a whole. When Kyle speaks, all listen. Linda Hamilton is a blast to watch as the sweet waitress who finds herself thrust into chaos and bloodshed. She's believable, what an I say? Also, for the screen time they receive, Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen as Lieutenant Ed Traxler and Detective Hal Vukovich respectively, are a blast to watch. They have excellent chemistry and work off each other excellently.<br/><br/>The effects are also quite good. Sure there are some cheesy lazer beams here and there, but overall the special effect where really good. The future war scenes/flashbacks are nicely crafted and disturbingly juxtaposed into images from our own society. The Terminator effects are also very well done. <br/><br/>There are just so many great scenes and so many great lines littered throughout this film. The scene in the Tech Noir club, the explosive police station scene, the scene with Linda and Kyle under the bridge. The Terminator has a very limited vocabulary, but he knows how to use it: When he leans in to tell the police receptionist that ""I'll be back"", you want to cheer. And the musical score by Brad Fiedel is just great.<br/><br/>The ending scene is probably one of my favorite scenes in the film. It ties everything together and leads perfectly into what is yet to come. It gives you a thirst for more, and sets the stage for an even more large scale Terminator adventure.<br/><br/>Which came in 1991<br/><br/>9/10"

","Many define hit movies like Star Wars, or Aliens that redefined and changed Sci-Fi, I disagree. I believe the Terminator did. Arnold Schwarzenegger arguably the most popular and well known body-builder, takes up a roll as an infamous villain known as The Terminator. One of the most well known, and realistic characters in Sci-Fi. It's a low-budget action, which limits the aspects that make a Action movie, supposedly good; but I was quite surprised. The movie had some good car chases, action scenes and battle-type fights, along with very suitable screenplay that made us catch every second of it's thrilling scenes. For a low-budget action, that created one of the most popular characters, and gave James Cameron that break in his directing career, it's a well put-together dark action movie with some very good acting and at times cheesy effects."
"tdaddict99","10","0","1","13 February 2009"," Fantastic movie, one of my favourites!
","This contains Spoilers.<br/><br/>The Terminator is one of those movies that was great for it's time. The special effects are quite outdated by todays standards, but I try to look past that and focus on the fact that for the time, it was good and it was acceptable. It must have been great to have seen this movie in the Cinemas back when it was released.<br/><br/>The Terminator plot is, at heart, a simple one, but many twists usually make it more complex, thus make it more compelling to watch, in my opinion. It's typically about the Present and the Future. The main character in this movie is Sarah Connor, who leads a simple life, but is going to be thrust into a life she never anticipated and I'm sure never wanted to have happened to her. A terminator from the future is sent into the past to kill Sarah Connor, which in turn kills John Connor, her unborn child. John Connor leads the resistance in the future and ultimately leads Humankind to victory in the war against the machines. The humans, who found out that they sent a Terminator in the past to try and kill Sarah Connor, which will wipe John Connor from existence and mean that the Robots will win the war, send a human Soldier, Kyle Reece,, to protect Sarah.<br/><br/>From then on, the movie gets interesting very fast. Unlike the sequels to this movie, this one is more violent and has a darker tone about it than the other movies have. In this movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator, like in the sequels, but this time he is bad, not good. It seems like a very slim chance that Sarah and Kyle can beat it, since it is two humans versing a machine, which is nearly indestructible (or would seem so if you were in a similar situation and tried everything against it). They eventually beat the Terminator, but not before Kyle Reece dies.<br/><br/>One of the twists in this movie is that Kyle Reece is the father of John Connor, and when you think about it it gets very complex and still gets me thinking as to how it might be. This movie makes you think in a way, and it's a different kind of action movie, if you focus on the story that is and not just the guns and pretty explosions that occur occasionally.<br/><br/>The music is pretty good. While not the best in terms of composing (it's very improvised therefore there are some times when some sounds do not sound right at all), it fits the movie. The use of synthesizers was a great touch, although at the time, synthesizers were prominent in most movies so it was kind of expected. Some of the music is upbeat, some of it a more darker tone and some of it is romantic, soft music, such as the Sex scene or for an upbeat scene, when Kyle is having a nightmare when he is in the future and is fighting versing the Machines.<br/><br/>The movie is well done, and although some things might be quite outdated by todays standards, you should still check it out."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","0","1","5 February 2009"," A very entertaining action thriller with a good story and memorable characters
","You can take contemporary American action cinema away entirely if you leave me James Cameron and John McTiernan. These guys make movies with enough thought and intelligence in them that you don't feel like an absolute moron watching them, often work with very good screenplays, and when it comes down to what really matters in an action thriller: really goddamn good action scenes, they know exactly how and what to deliver.<br/><br/>Now let's not waste any time on this nonsense about ""The Terminator"" being a thought-provoking intellectual sci-fi classic. It's not. It's a well-written, moderately intelligent, relatively smart movie, but still predominantly an action thriller which exists almost solely to entertain. What sets it apart and makes it memorable is that it features well-drawn, memorable characters, an interesting mythology, a terrific, gloomy atmosphere, brilliant effects which still hold up to this day, a really good, well though-out story, and, importantly: a lot of things explode, and they do so in an extremely entertaining manner.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography are really top-notch and combine to create the aforementioned atmosphere which would never really be recaptured in any of the other films in the franchise, and the action scenes are all spectacular. The cast is pretty good too, and Ahnuld's not bad either, mostly because he doesn't really have to act at all. I'll never understand how anyone can suggest he's a better actor than Stallone or even Van Damme, but to his credit he did star in some really good films, and was almost always smart about which roles he picked, early in his career at least. <br/><br/>There are many things that are great about ""The Terminator"" which are missing in ""T2"", but a common defense for fans who far prefer the first film has been its relative intelligence. It's a compelling enough as a sci-fi story, but this is all going a bit far with a film which is really just a great action thriller with a good story and characters. It might be damaging to the film's reputation that its fans are now so frequently acting as if it is a classic of intellectual sci-fi cinema, which is most certainly isn't. It's a classic of 80's action cinema, and I'm happy with it just as it is."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","2","30 December 2008"," ""The future"" inspires lots of great sci-fi movie-making thanks to ""Terminator""
","The explosion of Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, the emergence of James Cameron, and a couple classic one-liners are among the many things ""Terminator"" brought into cinematic culture forever, but one of the least considered gifts of this 1984 smash sci-fi action thriller is the introduction of movie goers everywhere to ""the future.""<br/><br/>A ""terminator"" cyborg (Schwarzenegger) is sent from the future with a specific objective to kill a girl named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Hot on the terminator's trail, however, is a human from the future named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who must save Sarah. Why? Sarah is the mother of John Connor, the leader of humanity's only resistance in the future when our machines/computers turn on us. The machines, desperate during this future war, have turned to time travel to completely eliminate Connor's existence. ""Terminator"" is a story that takes place in the present (well, 1984 present) but it's relevance is for the future and does include some ""flash-forwards"" of what creator James Cameron's man vs. machine apocalyptic future might look like. Most significantly, it's film's first serious attempt to imagine where science and technology might lead us.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Star Trek"" and ""2001: Space Odyssey"" are among some of the ways Hollywood has imagined the future, but those are much more fantastical and not focused on Earth. ""Terminator"" is a much darker depiction that strongly considers science, not on dreaming up crazy sci-fi gadgets and the like. It's also more of an action thriller than sci-fi, seeing as the action mostly takes place in the 80s. Basically, the Terminator is an unstoppable force that follows Sarah and Kyle wherever they go no matter how many bullets he takes or explosions he endures. It's a non-stop thrill ride that really gets your blood pumping.<br/><br/>While the movie thrives mostly on your amazement with the Terminator, wondering if he'll ever be stopped and how much carnage you'll get to watch along the way, eventually you get hooked on the future/sci-fi element as Kyle tells Sarah all about what's going on or he tries to convince the police to believe him. What makes each scene so attention-grabbing, however, is the mechanical nature of the way Cameron has shot this movie. Everything the terminator does is filmed in a very sequential manner, using lots of angles instead of constant camera movement. What's interesting is that he films construction vehicles and other normal machines we're used to in the same way, using close ups as if they're working on their own, without humans. It's his way of using the present to foreshadow the future.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie and love story that develops between Sarah and Kyle are among it's biggest weak points. Hamilton is good, she really stands out as the most normal, human thing about the whole film, but Biehn is terrible as a lead actor. He comes across as creepy and odd and you only like him because he's helping Sarah, so when she starts to like him, you're kind of grossed out. Someone stronger would have made this a nearly flawless action film. <br/><br/>So while ""Terminator' may seem like an example of a classic because of Schwarzenegger and all the action and explosions, it really leaves its mark as showing how capable Hollywood can be of creating an entertaining AND believable future, inspiring future films (no pun intended) to do just that."

","This is one of the best sci-fi films, with Schwarzenegger traveling back in time to kill the mother of a future revolutionary. The plot doesn't holdup too well on scrutiny, but that's why it's called science fiction. Arnold makes one of filmdom's meanest villains and gets to utter one of his famous lines, ""I'll be back."" Biehn is likable as the hero and Hamilton makes a lovely damsel in distress. Cameron, working with a small budget in only his second feature film as director, keeps the action moving at a break-neck pace as the tension mounts.

"vip_ebriega","8","0","1","13 July 2008"," Those men and their killing machines.
","My Take: Revolutionary for its storytelling and influences to the genre. <br/><br/>Highly regarded as one of the best sci-fi films of all time, James Cameron's brainchild THE TERMINATOR, released in 1984, has severely suffered a sort of dated feel. Suffering in comparison to the ever-advancing technology, the special effects and make-up have dated real badly from the low-tech technology available at the 80's to today. But in its heart, THE TERMINATOR still holds true with its story and anti-war message that still holds truth and never is too preachy, in fact not at all. THE TERMINATOR may not be the place to locate revolutionary special effects and action scenes, but it's in the writing department where the true heart of the film lies, as is its success. Arnold Schwarzenegger is still one of the creepiest bad guys around as the cold, emotionless cyborg from the violent future sen back to modern 1984 to kill a woman (Linda Hamilton) who will spawn a son who will lead humanity against a rebellion against war-machines in a futuristic war. Michael Biehn has gone surprisingly out of steam as a hero, so is Hamilton's character who rarely does anything more than play second-bananas. But THE TERMINATOR still holds a story and some key moments to hold its audiences. In other words, it still is a classic remnant of its age, an age where writing goes first above effects and star players.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

","Terminator is a great movie because it blends sci-fi and action perfectly. I first saw it at the age of six or seven and unsurprisingly it confused me. A few years later I caught it on TV and loved it. I was browsing through my local videostore a few weeks ago and it caught my eye and brought it. After viewing it again I loved it even more. Arnold Shwartznegger was great as The Terminator, this movie shot him to superstardom. I loved Terminator 2: Judgement day and I liked T3:rise of the machines to a certain extent but none of the sequels had the same impact the original had on me.

A great piece from the 80s. I am a big fan of the 80s so I loved this film. MPAA rating:R. Ages 10 and up. Great film because it is very original. It does not rely too much on special effects.

","What can you say...The ultimate 80's Sci-Fi actioner, James Cameron's bleak vision of the future is filmed in a dark, noirish style that oozes substance with clever narrative devices. The narrative however, is kept pretty linear, nothing else is happening but what you are seeing happening. Character development and narrative subtexts are also kept to a minimum so we are firmly concentrated on the action and the simple task that this unstoppable killing machine is trying to achieve. This is a formula Cameron would successfully repeat and more for his spectacular sequel T2, one of the best examples of a sequel surpassing its predecessor in terms of quality. However, he had a bigger cast, crew and lots more money for that and there is no doubt he would have made most of his later films like The Terminator if he wasn't given loads of dosh! (Damn Titanic studio execs!) However, The Terminator is a great, original film in its own right, perfectly suited to its 80's setting and besides it is also notable for making a star of Arnie. His monosyllabic T-800 became a cultural icon, getting more menacing as the film progresses into a thrilling climax. The great score by the underrated Brad Fidel (no not the Blackburn Rovers goalie!) only adds to the thrilling effect.<br/><br/>8/10"

"ujcsillag","10","0","1","29 February 2008"," In retrospect maybe terminator is what George Orwell had in mind about doublespeak
","In 1984 I was 14 and reading George Orwell's novel titled 1984, written in the 1930's I think. I remember finding the book very thought-provoking and wondering about the agenda of world governments and covert agencies. The sign I was looking to confirm Orwell's predictions specifically was what was referred to as doublespeak especially by members of the government. That summer in 84 the U.S was in a military conflict with someone, I forget who now. When they attacked their enemies they ended up killing members of their own forces. It was the first public use of the words ""friendly fire"". After that I became somewhat obsessed with comparing what people said with what they obviously meant.<br/><br/>Today re-reading the synopsis of Terminator (spoiler coming)I had a thought maybe the doublespeak referred to in the 1930's was foreknowledge of the future conflict where beings from the future would impact the events of the past for their own gain by exploiting real-time events that they had prior knowledge of. Specifically in the film the terminator imitates the voices of people to get information from people on the line who thought they were talking to their known companions. The doublespeak is the identity theft of the person's voices, later characteristics, now in real life real people's identities not just characters in a film are being stolen. In fact identity theft is the number one crime in North America now.<br/><br/>Do any of you think the reason for the emergence of so many password dependent activities is a means for the humans(victims) to plan and disseminate counter-insurgency strategies without tipping off the time-travelers? I zealously create brutally encrypted dialogue electronically and in person just in case we actually do have a foothold situation going on.<br/><br/>If this all sounds a bit too paranoid or far out just interpret this commentary as reflecting Terminator as being a really engaging provocative film that ideologically was really far ahead of it's time in its treatment of other-worldly anti-human conflict and how a disadvantaged species could overcome a superiorly prepared adversary by never giving in to despair and focusing on immediate survival needs with an eye to prophecy fulfillment."

It's also the way the Terminator is presented as a malevolence that is almost unstoppable. One of my favorite moments is watching Linda Hamilton's expression after Kyle Reese has pumped round after round in the the Terminator - and he still gets up! I swear, it is almost like ""The Omen"" - how do you stop a foe that is unstoppable? The 2nd movie was also good although I'm not wild about loudmouth kids acting beyond their years.

It's not that I for sure can tell which of these is the best, but Cameron has that strange gift to make a sequel that switch genre, but still keeping the top quality. If Judgment day is a Punch-In-The-Face-Action Flick, then The Terminator is a chilling classic thriller with some great, but never over the top action scenes.<br/><br/>The development of Sarah feels believable, even though it all only occurs during one night. It 's like the same transformation Luke Skywalker goes through, but packed into 1h 50m without feeling rushed. Impressive screen writing.

Arnold Schwarzenegger's fate was to play the role of The Terminator, the unstoppable machine with an ability to erase everything between him and his target.<br/><br/>Terminator goes back through time from the year 2029 to the middle of the 80's. His mission is to kill Sarah Connor, the upcoming mother of mankind's only hope, John Connor. Arnold's acting is perfect, everything from the robotic movements to the experienced handling of fire-arms. The scene where he makes a killing spree in the police station with a machine gun in the other hand, and a shotgun in the other is bad ass! That is my favorite scene in the movie, and one of my favorite scenes in the movie history.<br/><br/>The human resistance sends a soldier named Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah. Later we find out that Kyle's only mission was not just to protect her, but to become the father of John Connor. This unique plot turn makes our minds go crazy from thinking all this, John sends his own father back through time to ""make"" him.<br/><br/>In the end Kyle blows up The Terminator, unfortunately not surviving from the explosion. But the machine isn't dead yet! Finally Sarah destroys it with a hydraulic compressor and soon is taken to the hospital.<br/><br/>In Terminator 2: Judgment Day we find out that after driving down the highway in the end of the previous movie Sarah tried to blow up the computer factory responsible from the nuclear war.<br/><br/>My opinion: Excellent story, excellent actors/acting, and excellent action scenes with mind-blowing gun-fights; definitely an amazing movie! 9/10 points."

Since my father had introduced me to the music of Jean-Michel Jarre, I found that the score music from Brad Fiedel helped create the mood of the film, alongside the vocal tracks from: Linn Van Hek; Tahnee Cain & Tryanglz; Jay Ferguson & 16mm.<br/><br/>At the time, my father was employed by Intel as a chip designer, so the film in some ways seemed to be connected to my life. I was becoming very interested in computers, electronic music & robots.

For Sarah Conner it's just an outlandish nightmare that won't end, and she goes through an understandable range of emotions: hysteria, incredulity, anger and affection for her protector before reaching down inside herself and finding the resolve to end her ordeal.

","""I'll be back."" Uttered by the Terminator just before he launches into a murderous rampage as he looks for Sarah Connor, a woman who will give birth to the savior of humanity in the future. The Terminator is not simply an action film. The Terminator is not simply a sci-fi film. It is both rolled into one. However the Terminator breaks away from the norm of all flash and no show.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor is a regular woman living in Los Angeles. She's normal until someone attempts to assassinate her and then protected by a man claiming to be the future. The story is pretty much this stranger attempting to protect Sarah from this assassin who says very little. However the assassin is not human, he is a cyborg and the man claiming to be from the future actually is from the future sent back in time to protect the mother of the future savior of humanity against the machines who will attempt to destroy it.<br/><br/>When I first read the plot for this I was so confused I was uncertain I wanted to watch it. Finally I did and I loved it and go back to it for a good story. The film could have been terrible. Everything could have gone wrong but Cameron was the driving force behind the film. He makes everything work how it should from the action to the plot to the acting. Everything flows as it should. It showed how much skill Cameron had even in his younger days of directing. (Remember this is 13 years before Titanic would come out)<br/><br/>The acting is nothing great. Yes Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton give convincing performances. Michael Biehn in my opinion was one of your top actors in the 80's and he pretty much disappeared. In The Terminator he is cool, bright, sexy, and all else convincing as a soldier turned bodyguard. Linda Hamilton shows how true actresses should act. She convinced me she had no idea what was going on when she first had that gun pointed in her face. Both leads give strong and worthwhile performances.<br/><br/>Of course the most famous of the film is Arnold. Cold, cunning, and silent he portrays the Terminator. I really must comment that Arnold barely does any acting whatsoever except for walking, shooting, and a rare word or two. However, it doesn't mean he is a waste on the screen. Arnold, when he found out how little acting he was going to have to do made sure he was using the weapons correctly and acting as much a machine as he possibly could. <br/><br/>The story is actually very strong. Instead of no evidence being given of the future a ton of information is given including flashbacks (or would it be flash forwards) of battles Reese has gone through in his life. Nothing is set directly, many things have to be figured out on your own but nothing is really difficult to understand. The plot line is complex and an amazing world is painted around the story<br/><br/>The action scenes are some of my personal favorites, especially the showdown in the police station. Cameron got exactly what he wanted when he directed the film. He wanted darkness, rage, violence, a story line that worked. However, the film isn't all about action and violence, it is about humanity and how it is destroying itself. He wanted to show what the future could hold for humans with the possession of nuclear weapons and advancements in technology. He got exactly that. Cameron wanted to make as dark a film as he possibly could with top action sequences of the time and a sci-fi world only outdone by Star Wars in a film. <br/><br/>4/5 stars"

Linda Hamilton (who later became Mrs. James Cameron) delivers a star-making performance as Sarah Conner, the ordinary woman who is completely baffled as to why she has become a target for termination. Michael Beihn is sexy and charismatic as the soldier from the future who has also been sent back to stop the terminator and protect Sarah. Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen garner some chuckles as police trying to protect Sarah and there's an early albeit brief appearance by a young Bill Paxton as an early victim of the terminator. If you're an action fan whose never seen this, it's a must. Followed by a sequel called TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY."
"charchuk","9","0","1","15 April 2007"," Terrific action and smart sci-fi
","One of the best science fiction films of all time. A perfect blend of action thrills and sci-fi intrigue, with a fair dose of horror elements throw in. The story borrows from a ton of sources, but still manages to be mostly original, and actually all makes sense in the end. Time travel stuff can get pretty dodgy sometimes, but this manages to all work out with a predestination paradox explaining everything. The sequels kind of ruin this part of the story, but this film executes it perfectly. It's also got some great acting, from Arnold's iconic role to Michael Biehn's under-appreciated performance to Linda Hamilton's surprisingly good turn, and some terrific effects, considering how low-budget it was. The action sequences are perfectly staged, and the exciting climax is both terrifying and exhilarating. Though I like T2 better, I can appreciate how influential this film was."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","1","29 March 2007"," An action masterpiece? Wrong! (But a fine film regardless) (spoilers)
","When people criticise Terminator 2, they usually point out how annoying Edward Furlong is. Then they cite the 'thumbs up' and the dodgy robot sentimentality. And after this they point out how much tougher The Terminator is, as if it's devoid of corn. Are they forgetting what a drip Linda Hamilton is in this film ('guard it for me, big buns')? Are they overlooking how cheesy the romance between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese is? Do they forget how embarrassing Sarah's flatmate is? None of this spoils my enjoyment of what is a great film, but the nitpicking of Terminator 2 and the concessions that are made to The Terminator baffle me somewhat  both are fantastic action movies, but both have their flaws.<br/><br/>Watching it for the first time in years, the thing that made me laugh the most about The Terminator was the romantic relationship between the hero and heroine. In one scene Reese tells Sarah that he came through time for her ('coming' through time almost being literal, as his appearance in the film has him shaking, with steam pouring off him, like he's experienced an earth-shattering orgasm), and then after he admits to being a virgin, and to carrying a photo of her around with him, they have some tearful sex as a piano version of the title theme plays. Woah. So basically Reese has come through time to fulfil a masturbatory fantasy of popping his cherry with his boss's mum; a boss who is also, unbeknownst to him, his son? Well, I guess snatch is as good a reason as any to save the world.<br/><br/>But the fact that Reese is a virgin makes me ponder what the resistance is doing in this post-apocalyptic world. Surely such a dire situation would call for prodigious breeding. Strapping young men would surely be required to service young ladies aplenty to help perpetuate the species and build the army (and what better release after fighting lots of gnarly robots?). But alas, from what I can gather, the human army doesn't have any such program. No wonder Reese had to travel through time  radiation-soaked poontang just hasn't got the same appeal as some good, clean 80s beaver.<br/><br/>Joking aside, the central relationship, while sappy in its beginnings and embarrassing in its consummation, does work well for the final section of the film. Without it the final act would have just been a traditional action finale, with a predictable confrontation and lots of false endings. But because Cameron invests the film with some emotion  the actors somehow manage to cut through the cheese  it makes the Terminator's stalking of Sarah all the more terrifying, especially after Reese is killed. You're so used to her relying on him that she suddenly seems incredibly vulnerable and isolated, which makes her victory at the end more significant but rather hollow, too. The downbeat ending certainly works well for the film.<br/><br/>But although some aspects of the romance aren't particularly convincing, at least they're less embarrassing than Sarah's flatmate Ginger and Ginger's boyfriend. These are characters we're meant to fall in love with; we're meant to weep for their tragic demise. But their dirty phone calls and big hair and Walkman sex (watch Ginger pouting and nodding as she turns the headphones up as her boyfriend begins pumping her) are so ridiculous that I couldn't help but cheer as the Terminator brutally slayed them. I only wished their deaths would have been more painful and prolonged.<br/><br/>However, that's a big part of The Terminator  even though he's the bad guy, we're meant to get a kick out of Arnie killing people. And indeed we do. My favourite killing has to be that of the gun store owner. 'Which will it be?' the man asks. 'All', says Arnie. And then when Arnie begins loading one of his guns the man tells him he can't do that. 'Wrong' is Arnie's pithy reply. Wonderful! <br/><br/>A close runner up to this is when the Terminator kills the first Sarah Connor. 'Sarah Connor?' he asks, and then when she replies 'Yes', he blows her away. Simple but effective, and further proof, if any was needed, not to answer the door if any strange Austrians in punk outfits come-a-calling, especially ones carrying concealed weapons.<br/><br/>But as enjoyable as these individual slayings are, they kind of pale in comparison to the police precinct massacre. The men in blue get blown away left, right and centre, and secretly, everyone in the audience begins to cheer  a large part of The Terminator's appeal lies in a kind of wish fulfilment; we all wish that we could be as morally liberated as the Terminator; anyone who annoys us or gets in our way gets blown to kingdom come.<br/><br/>Which reminds me of one of my favourite moments in the film. There's a bit where The Terminator is scanning Sarah Connor's address book. A cleaner stops outside and asks Arnie whether he's got a dead cat in there. The Terminator scans a few possible replies and then responds with 'F*** you, a******'. Oh what joy it must be to be an emotionless cyborg  profanities and threats can be thrown out without fear of repercussions.<br/><br/>But I think Arnie deserves a hell of a lot of credit for the success of The Terminator. Sure Cameron's direction is excellent, and Hamilton and Biehn both do decent jobs, but it's the creepy image of an eyebrowless Schwarzenegger that makes the film so watchable. It may sound like an insult to say that Arnie is great at playing a robot, but it's true  his portrayal is scary, disturbing and completely convincing. Plus he has buns of steelquite literally (and a little willy, too, if you watch carefully  I guess you can't have everything)."

","""The Terminator"" is arguably the role that Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play. It is, in my humble opinion, his best film. It's the only time in his career, I believe, where he played a totally villainous character with no redeeming qualities (forget about ""The Iceman"" in that Batman film).<br/><br/>Written and directed by James Cameron, the action and suspense are non-stop from start to finish. And the best part is that Arnold has minimal dialog, which I believe adds to the sinister nature of his character.<br/><br/>The Terminator (Arnold) is sent back to the present (i.e. 1984) from 2029 to terminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to a futuristic leader, John Connor. Also traveling back in time is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who is sent by Connor to stop the terminator.<br/><br/>We learn from Reese that the terminator is a cyborg, part machine, part human who is programmed only to seek out and kill Sarah Connor. He has no feeling and cannot be reasoned with. Two other women with the same name are murdered by the terminator before Sarah realizes the Reese is trying to help her. We also learn that neither Reese nor the terminator can return to the future.<br/><br/>The police, led by Lt. Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) and Detective Hal Vukoviich (Lance Henriksen) try to give Sarah police protection. When the terminator tracks her down to the police station. Arnold utters his now famous line: ""Ah'll be back!"" And back he is.<br/><br/>The rest of the film has Reese and Sarah encountering and escaping from the terminator until....................................<br/><br/>Arnold makes a terrifying villain. Its a wonder, he didn't seek out more such roles. Hamilton makes a fetching heroine. she was or was about to be marries to James Cameron around this time. Watch for Bill Paxton as the leader of the punks who confront Arnold at the beginning of the story.<br/><br/>Followed by two sequels where Arnold reprises his role, but as a good terminator."

","The allusion to Terminator 2 happened in Terminator 1. In Terminator 1 there is the Terminator killing over 15 police officers.<br/><br/>Little did I realize that all of this killing was a diversion for the Terminator's main mission...to put to death Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>The big climax of course was the big piece of what this movie was all about. The chase scene between the young soldier and Sarah Connor and the stalking Terminator.<br/><br/>And that young soldier who threw nitroglycerin bombs at the Terminator during the chase scene was vulnerable. Every time the bombs blew up, the Terminator found a way to evade them.<br/><br/>Well, the young soldier wins a partial victory against the Terminator's stalking of Sarah Connor, putting one nitro bomb on the Terminator's body. The Terminator blows up when the bomb detonates but the young soldier, sadly, immediately dies from blunt force trauma from the Terminator's roundhouse punch to the soldier's head before the soldier planted the bomb into the Terminator.<br/><br/>The blast leaves the Terminator only in a bare endoskeleton with only his face, arms and torso intact (the legs were completely gone), and you think he's gone? No. He comes back meaner and treacherous than ever, as he entraps Sarah Connor. But Sarah Connor knows what to do. The Terminator doesn't know about a crushing hydraulic press...only about killing Sarah. The Terminator's hand extends to Sarah's neck, but Sarah escapes eventual doom by pressing the red button to set off the hydraulic press. <br/><br/>The Terminator has no escape....he gets crushed to death by the press in about 20 seconds...and never to return to life again."

","The Terminater: Huge and almost unstoppable, but not just a tank with legs, it uses subterfuge and guerrilla tactics to hunt its enemy down. It has an artificial intelligence that seems both human and machine.<br/><br/>Reese: Was raised in a future concentration camp, instead of Nazis they are run by machines and their credo is not to wipe out one race but all races, all organic life. <br/><br/>Sarah Conner: mother to a hero, but when we first see her she's just an ordinary twenty year old with no major plans for the future.<br/><br/>There are many great scenes in Termniater and a few duff ones, in places the effects look great and in others the budget and technology of the time make scenes look dated. The main theme of the film is technology gone out of control, this was made during the height of the cold war and 'a nuclear error' (to quote Joe Strummer) was on everyones mind. the Termninater is a great screen villain, completely implacable following his grisly programming without an iota of self doubt, truly a 'super soldier'. The cast turn in great performances even the minor roles are well fleshed out, particularly the humorous interplay between the 'seen it all before' detectives. It has a bleak apocalyptic ending with Sarah retreating to the mountains of Mexico to raise John in isolation to fight the future war."

"qhr-1","10","0","1","18 September 2006"," Terminator = Cinematic Perfection
","James Cameron's 1984 low-budget blockbuster film The Terminator, one of the most popular movies of the 1980's, has become an American cinematic legend whose follow-up installments T2 and T3 continued to push the boundaries of action, suspense, and special effects. The success of the first film is due to many factors, primarily Cameron's cinematically efficient illustration of a tight story that he fills with powerful and iconic imagery frequently interspersed with dark humor.<br/><br/>Following an ominous credit sequence perfectly paired with Brad Fiedel's metallic 13/8 score, the scene of the garbage truck and the dumpster immediately conveys Terminator's power and effect on its environment. Its flaming time-travel arrival, like the detonation of a nuclear blast, renders the truck useless and sends the terrified driver scurrying for cover (after uttering ""What the Hell--"" the identical ADR soundbite looped from his previous interior cab shot).<br/><br/>The three punks at the Griffith Observatory are perfectly rendered. While horsing around with a coin-op telescope, Brian Thompson's character spots the approaching muscle-bound, completely nude Terminator and wonders, ""What's wrong with this picture?"" Bill Paxton's tire-tread facial tattoo and sneering opener ""Nice night for a walk,"" and Brad Rearden's guffaw and arm tap response, are potent character details. In T2, we learn that the T101's cpu is set to read-only since he's out alone. However, the conclusion of this exchange seems to display its capability as a ""learning computer;"" Paxton's obscene three-word rebuke to the cyborg's clothing request was later included in the Termo-vision response choices to the flophouse janitor's query, ""You got a dead cat in there, or what?"" Arnold's flat Austrian-flavored delivery dynamically reinforces the reality of the machine beneath the rotting flesh, functioning as designed despite its chronically damaged exterior. <br/><br/>The scene in the gun shop, the deadly conclusion of which is obvious from the worm's eye POV of Arnold's entrance, is another example of humor and violence. After handling the AR-180, the Franchi SPAS 12-gauge auto-loader (you can go pump, or auto), the 45 long slide with laser sighting (that's a good gun), the T101 requests a ""phased plasma rifle in a 40-watt range,"" to which the salesman matter-of-factly replies, ""Hey, just what you see, pal"" as if he had simply asked for an illegal weapon like a rocket launcher. Or as if a secret code word would avail him to the shop's special selection of weaponry a la the white supremacist's private cache in Falling Down.<br/><br/>Rising from Kyle's first volley of blasts in the nightclub, he kicks his firepower up a notch as he unleashes the Uzi. His deliberate, ""here-it-comes"" lock'n'load is a choreographed ballet of impending destruction, as seen from Sarah's POV. After being blown back through the glass, he rises from the sidewalk and begins chasing Kyle and Sarah, his pace accelerating steadily just like a machine. Or a hyper-alloy combat chassis, tersely described by wheel-gripping, teeth-baring Reese as ""microprocessor controlled, fully armored, very tough."" He then sums it all up for a dubious Sarah: ""That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!"" Classic.<br/><br/>The nonchalance with which the T101 smashes the window of the station wagon, gets in and slams the door, and sends glass flying into his hair and face, is comical in its depiction of Terminator as a cold machine. As he pulls up to the curb in front of the first Sarah Connor's house, the front tire stops on and partially crushes a blue toy truck. Arnold the destroyer. Chasing Kyle and Sarah in the tanker truck, his red eye can be seen glowing from behind the cab's darkened windshield. He absolutely will not stop!<br/><br/>The overwhelming brutality of the Terminator is most clearly displayed in the police station ""I'll be back"" scenes. Easily wielding the AR-180 with his right hand and the infamous Franchi auto-loader with his left, he marches through the corridors wasting everyone he sees (17 in all), complete with a flanged Termo-vision braaaaap! across the wall after a fleeing cop. In Cameron's ever-increasing display of force and destruction, Terminator wraps up the massacre by taking out detective Vukovich with half a dozen automatic rounds AND a shotgun blast.<br/><br/>You might notice during that police station sequence a scene where the T101, back to the camera, swings the 12-gauge up with his left hand. When he pulls the trigger, they foleyed in (twice) an automatic-rifle burst instead of a shotgun blast. Another continuity issue: Reese saws off the stock of the shotgun and loudly racks it toward the camera. He wakes from the future-war nightmare in the car, and racks it again. No shell ejected? Then, in the night club, he whips it out from under his coat and does it one more time. Visual power trumps continuity. And it is exactly that frequent insertion of forceful imagery throughout Cameron's epic story that has made The Terminator one of the most memorable icons of 20th-century American cinema. -Ben Strout, 2006"

","Well, In fact i was so little when this movie was made! (I wasn't born yet!) The story is the most beautiful story ever written.The cast member (from Arnie to the last extra) is made of gold. Why? 'Cos they made a new legend. The same way that Ford Coppola made his ""Godfather"" Jim Cameron create the new feeling about human life, love and the relations between people. How many cost human life? It could cost a lot or, in other hand, nothing ( a micro-sec, like Resee told in the first part) Really why do we cry? Neither ourself can reply to this question.<br/><br/>This part is the beginning of a legend: Sarah Connor, my hero. I always will wanted to be like her. It could be that this film was considered as B series, but there are so many reasons to consider it as a great film.<br/><br/>First of all they create a new visual effects: Animatronics, which have been used in so many films. And the best scene i even seen was when Sarah is waiting to a police in a disco in Pico Blv. and the Terminator is searching her. But just when the Terminator pass by the side of Sarah she goes down to catch a bottle she dropped. And when she returns to sit, she crosses the look with Resee.<br/><br/>Some many People used to critic that if Resee is the Jonh's father why doesn't change the future?

The one man sent to stop the Terminator. The story unfolds, and it's gets better with character and plot development. Listen well. The action is well done and keeps you pumped. It also takes Sarah a while to finally be convinced that a evil machine has been sent to kill her. I also like it when the Terminator's skin begins to tear off and you can see the red eye's glow and metal skull. Cool visual. <br/><br/>The Last Word: Awesome. Remains a timeless classic.

"robb_772","8","0","1","28 July 2006"," Genre-defining classic
","Made on a relatively low budget, James Cameron's now-seminal sci-fi/action thriller should be considered a model of efficient film-making. Cameron and his fellow artisans managed to create a tightly-constructed and imaginative film under considerably meager constraints, and yet the finished film remains highly impressive even when viewed some 20 odd years later. Aside from a few shoddily obvious rear projection shots, the special effects are still realistic and credible, and much of the f/x makeup and prosthetic work remain seamless. Yet, as impressive as the film's technical merits may be, it is the sensitive and surprisingly effective storyline that has propelled this film to the status of modern classic.<br/><br/>A creative blend of time-travel science fiction, heart-pounding action, and organic, non-cloying romance, THE TERMINATOR manages to hit all of the right notes without ever condescending to the obvious nor feeling constrained and stilted. Playing the title role elevated Austrian actor/bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger into Hollywood's A-list virtually overnight, and the monosyllabic, impossibly built cyborg is still probably the best use of Schwarzenegger's steely screen presence. Linda Hamilton is likable and sympathetic as Schwarzenegger's intended victim, and Michael Biehn is terrific as a weary professional soldier. Although I also liked the high-octane, effects-heavy, multi-million dollar sequel, the comparatively low tech original remains a creative and highly influential watershed moment for the genre."

","James Cameron makes his science fiction masterpiece about time travel, cyborgs, guns, chicks, and Arnold. Hot damn this was an awesome movie! I had never seen this before so I watched this with extreme scrutiny considering the heaps of praise everyone lavishes upon this movie, and I have to say nearly every bit of it holds up like a rock. Cameron tackles the subject of the past affecting the future through time travel without skipping a beat and barrels his movie down a slip and slide of action. Action splashed here, splashed there, action freaking everywhere. The stop motion was great as was the dark, almost black post-apocalyptic world of the future. We see tank machines rolling over dozens of skulls and bones, lasers, guns, battle armor, flying machines, this movie was so much fun. About the only problems I had with the movie were the Highlander-esquire special lightning effects at the beginning of the movie. If I were going to update anything, it would have to be the way the lighting licked the metal pipes while the bum in the alleyway looked on unfazed at the storm of blue electricity. Either it was the bum's lack of reaction that I didn't like or it was the actual special effect. It's hard to decide. Anyways, another classic film from the science fiction genre down thanks to the University library."
"abum190","8","0","1","28 April 2006"," Ah, Ahnold
","He's buff, stone-faced, and genuinely scary in this movie- my first thought at the end of this movie was ""He'd make a good governor of California."" Well, perhaps not. But it's hard to imagine The Terminator without Schwarzeneggar (I attempted to spell it without looking), and maybe that's only because the Terminator and Arnold have become synonymous since 1984. You can't think Terminator without thinking ""Ah'll be back."" Of course, I wasn't even born in '84, so I don't really know how the movie was received before he became a cultural icon, but from the perspective of a 16-year-old here and now, I think it's a great movie.<br/><br/>When you ignore the fact that now Ahnold is and always will be the Terminator, you can see that he really was good in the role. Sure, there isn't much for him to do- he talks in monotone, glares, and flexes- but his build, his accent, his face, everything about him was built for playing a robot- excuse me, cyborg. Kyle Reese would yell at me for being so glib.<br/><br/>The hero of the movie, the aforementioned Kyle Reese, is played by Michael Biehn, who has a few shining moments, but doesn't really impress for the rest of the film. Linda Hamilton, on the other hand, shines throughout the entire movie as a young woman whose entire life turns upside down. She doesn't do the girlish freakout, a clichÃ© that has grown really old, probably even by 1984; instead, she focuses on the fact that her life depends on every move she makes- while still showing fear. Hamilton pulls that off magnificently, despite a script that throws a few cheesy lines her way, thought she handles the cheese a lot better than Biehn does.<br/><br/>I may sound pretty critical so far, what with the cheese and my disappointment with one of the main stars, but the truth is, despite those flaws, the rest of the movie delivers. Some people say this movie has an anti-nuclear-war message- I say, sure, for maybe five minutes. This isn't a message movie- it's a thriller, full of meaty action that really does thrill. The whole movie is basically a chase scene, but the chasing is gripping and creatively laid out. The only other James Cameron film I've seen is Titanic, and with these two movies I can tell that Cameron is very good at engaging the audience in intelligent action. The plot line is as creative as the action with its detailed mythology and harrowing climax. I don't want to ruin any of it though, because it's really a good story. Just see it, and you'll understand.<br/><br/>It's a fun movie, and by now has been raised into the classic zone. And after seeing it a few times and not tiring of it in the least, I can see why."
"aalataur","10","0","2","2 April 2006"," Great, simply great
","Well, what can I say. Simply the greatest action movie ever, and I've seen a LOT of them. <br/><br/>I prefer it to T2, and any other Cameron film to that matter. It has more solid ""mood"" to it than T2, less commercial ""Terminator Action Figure"" -like. Harder, colder, bleak, dark and still full of emotion. I like the blue greenish color palette. I love the intensity and cohesiveness of the visuals. There's nothing to add, every frame counts. A brilliant plot, I like how the story unfolds during chase scenes. The story moves like a freight train. No scene could have been left out. Every shot and every line is perfect. Michael Biehn is great as a passionate soldier, who has seen no peace. He is always good as a soldier. <br/><br/>I like so many things about it better than T2, which is also great sci-fi / action movie. Music is great, especially in the scene where Sarah and Reese escape from the police station. Gives me the chills every time. Also love the two 80's songs playing in the Tech Noir -club. <br/><br/>Yeah, it's 80's movie and hair styles would make you laugh in any other movie. But in this one, they don't bother me. They are the only thing goofy about the film. Even Arnie fits the role. Terminator scanning environment while driving the police car, with burned eyebrows - great scene. Looks really machine -like. <br/><br/>People always whine about the terminator FX in the final scenes. Why? They look great. Especially the closeup shots, scary stuff. The music is also awesome in this part, when Terminator lifts the door off for example... I love it, music goes hand in hand with every frame. Few sci-fi monsters look scary, but T-800 looks scary, the bleak stare and forever grinning teeth. <br/><br/>Also, the movie is clever. It has something to say. About nukes and technology spreading everywhere. The time travel element in a plot always causes plot holes, 'cos time traveling is a paradox. In every time traveling movie there's plot holes, Terminator hides them well enough for a action flick."

","What I most enjoyed about The Terminator was the great writing of the story. If you stand back and look at the overall movie, it is very similar to the well-written sci-fi stories that you read in the anthologies. The screenplay's brilliance lies in its ability to tell a science fiction story within a contemporary urban setting, without losing any of the impact of making you feel like you have been transported to another world.<br/><br/>The special effects look a little dated (although it's amazing what was done given the limitations) for those who are purists for that sort of thing, but if you like a good sci-fi story, you will very quickly start to forget about analyzing the special effects. There is significant violence in the film, just as a warning, although frankly I think it is not gratuitous and is not nearly as bad as what you might see in a thriller/horror movie today.<br/><br/>So if you find yourself getting annoyed with the quality of science fiction movies today, or if you feel that lately the fantasy movies are getting all of the attention, go see The Terminator and you will be pleasantly surprised at how exciting it is!"

","Arnold Schwartzenegger's claim to fame differs from most B-movies that it has aged extremely well. James Cameron's haunting cinematography, great actor performances and above all, a brilliant baddie make this a memorable film. Arnold Schwarzenegger almost doesn't feel human anyway, so in this movie he's perhaps showing off a characteristic that you don't find in just any actor.<br/><br/>What still makes this movie extremely worth-while too is the excellent soundtrack. Though done entirely on a synthesizer, it sounds brilliant and fits the action like a glove. Big props to Brad Fiedel. <br/><br/>Also, unlike some other typically violent movies, this one keeps everything fresh and doesn't become boring or repetitive. The relentless grind of the Terminator's hunt gives the film a truly successful feeling of suspense.<br/><br/>A unique film and a stand-out product of the 1980s."

","I think that everyone must see this movie because in this day and age, movies are not made like this. Today there is too much special effects it's ridiculous. True this movie uses stop-motion animation but it doesn't even come close to LOTR or Jurassic Park. Yes this movies was made by Cameron but if you can look past that, then you will enjoy this movie. Now this movie is not as good as two but still is a classic hands down. This movie is even on 3 different AFI'S 100 Greatest lists. Now there is something to think about.<br/><br/>Now for those of how who don't know the movie, here is a summary. It is 2029 and ""The Machines, Robots, or Cyborgs is mostly what they use in this movie,"" they are in a war with the human race. And Skynet, the people who build these things in factors that all look like robots, come up with a new cyborg called ""The Terminator."" This new Cyborg is made in a factory on an assembly line and they all look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. In this movie then send one terminator back in time to kill John Connor who is the leader of the humans. Then send him to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) his mother. But the human also send a solider named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn.) Who will win Arnold or Michael? You'll have to find out.<br/><br/>This is a classic and I hope you see this movie real soon or if you have, I hope you are like the movie as much as I do.

","Ultimately there is only one thing that prevents me giving higher score for ""The Terminator"": the soundtrack. There was lots and lots of synthesized music back in 80's and from some reason James Cameron decided to be cool and hip and he wanted one in his film. Which I think was a mistake and I am really hoping, that Cameron would do a special edition with some better tracks. Now, there are some good tracks on the film, but mostly all action sequences are plagued with those horrible synthesized music tracks.<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten that out from my chest I can say here, that otherwise I like the film: it's greatly directed and written.

","If I had to list my favourite SF movies of all time, ""The Terminator"" would probably top the list. ""Terminator"" manages to be both violent and cerebral, to have enough action and enough intelligence, to have a good premise and a great message.<br/><br/>This is THE best of the Terminator movies - despite looking painfully out-of-date in this CGI-dependent age (such as the stop-motion endoskeletons and the damaged Terminator heads), it's still of inconsequence. This movie has a relatively simple story - running from the ultimate killing machine - yet an intricate back story makes it more than just your average chase movie.<br/><br/>""Terminator"" is so totally convincing with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) as the lead, in a non-exploitative role so clearly lacking in modern action movies (re: Charlie's Angels). She manages to be a person truly scared by what's going on - namely the Terminator and Reese. For the first part of the movie, it's hard to know who is the scarier.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen it, seek it out. It might seem ugly in comparison to CGI-soaked epics such as Star Wars and LOTR, but the effects do not matter so much.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The Terminator is an all time favorite movie of mine. No need to write about it per say, so much as already been said over the last two decades since its release. I was just a kid when it first came out but it stuck it my head as being forward thinking even then. The one improbable aspect is time travel, scarily the other sci-fi in the story is becoming increasingly likely. A new book called ""Radical Evolution"" by Joel Garreau explores various endeavors by DARPA (Goverment's (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) The direction that scientists in the book are taking is one geared towards making people more than human (Enhanced) and melding them with machine and vice versa.

"jofitz27","9","0","2","20 May 2005"," A brutal, yet flawed classic
","In 1984, little known director James Cameron picked up little known body building muscle man Arnold Schwarzenegger for a sci fi action movie 'The Terminator'. In short, both do very good jobs: Cameron, with his excellent provision of special effects and action sequences, and Arnold, expertly playing the terminator: an emotionless killing machine.<br/><br/>For the time, and even now, this film is nearly startlingly brutal. Less slow than 'Alien' and more in your face, this is a no-holds, dark piece of work, as this piece of human metal performs hideous operations and cold bloodily (yes, the Terminator has blood) kills innocent (or not so innocent) beings.<br/><br/>This film was a landmark for it's time, a lot to do with the special effects. Maybe less so impressive today, but the action sequences are frequent, and frequently impressive. This is tense, exciting stuff, from the word go. We care for our characters, but in a strange way, this Terminator has likable qualities: it manages to be so insensitive, yet so undeniably unstoppably cool.<br/><br/>Where this film faults is general errors. They may be little, and not hold back the entertainment value, but do stick out like a knife in the back. (Note: James Cameron directed 'The Titanic', check this website for goofs!) For instance, the tension is unintentionally held back in one scene where our heroin desperately shoves a quarter into a phone box and dials 911. Since when is money needed for emergency calls?<br/><br/>Still, this is brutal and effective: a classic, and still today, it remains and very solid, if faulted, movie.<br/><br/>***/ out of **** (3 and a half out of 4)"

","i wont write up the story due to the fact its on the main page..I love this movie i think its bar far the best of the three and have seen it many times, i also own the new remastered DVD and noticed some of the gunshot sounds have been changed and think that they sound awful and don't match the weapon whatsoever i personally think they sounded better originally my friend who also owns this said the very same thing to me, and i think most people will agree i wonder who was responsible for it because they want shooting! i think this is Arnold's best role just due to the way he acts "" very robotic"" and suits the role perfectly and couldn't see it played by any other actor. Michael beihn who is also known for choosing not to play the main as he plays such a good part is awesome in this movie and i have looked for him in many other movies due to his performance in this, which is also brilliant in aliens, another favourite movie of mine....terminator two was also very good because it has the right kind of humour in it, whereas when i watch the third instalment i think of it as ""seperate"" from the other two as you cant take it seriously and i think that really spoils what could have been a slightly better movie, shame Cameron's didn't direct! a great movie that is definitely worth owning,"

","I first saw the Terminator back in 1996 at the time I hadn't seen too many science fiction films and after watching it I thought of it as one of the best films of all time.<br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance as a killing machine was sensational his character showed no fear or remorse for his actions, Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor a timid woman turned brave warrior amazed me in the beginning she was a girl who couldn't balance a cheque book and by the end she became a strong person prepared to face the history of things to come. Michael Biehn's role as Kyle Reese a soldier sent from the future to protect an important person showed determination. His character had emotions ranging from courage to passion it still is a great action film about transformation and preparing to face your destiny.<br/><br/>In the year 2029 a computer known as Skynet had waged a deadly war against humanity for years now they've created the ultimate weapon called terminators. On the outside they look human but on the inside they're cyborgs designed to kill, now a terminator has been sent back in time to May of 1984. His mission is to eliminate Sarah Connor (Hamilton) a young woman whose unborn son John will become the leader of the human resistance that will fight against the machines and achieve victory. <br/><br/>All that stands between them is Kyle Reese (Biehn) a young soldier sent back to protect her & ensure her survival. It's a terrifying race against time as Sarah & Kyle keep fighting a battle to the finish to smash that killer to pieces.<br/><br/>I rate this film 9/10"

Boy was I wrong! This movie hooked me from the opening scene and even Arnold's stiff sounding dialogue was perfect for the cyborg he was playing! The chase scenes and narrow escapes had my heart pounding throughout the film! There were many scenes in this film that were firsts for movies such as Arnold removing a damaged robotic eyeball, seeing how the robot mind decided on what dialogue to say and having a robot disguise their voice to sound exactly like a dead human! The other Terminator films may have had the computer enhanced special effects, but they could not match the storyline of this action/SciFi classic that is probably the best all time of its genre!"
"Tom16uk","9","0","1","20 December 2004"," 100% classic stuff.
","The Terminator has everything - action, romance, slight humour and a brilliant storyline. The reason the story line is so good, is because unlike a lot of films these days, this film could become a reality. The idea of machines and computers taking over our world is a definite possibility, as they will indeed become cleverer than us. (fact)<br/><br/>But getting back to the film, the special effects are what most caught my eye. Indeed, by todays standards using stop motion animation (plasticine models moved one frame at a time) is dated, but I feel this made the film seem scarier some how. Just seeing the T-101 's endoskeleton walking down the corridor at the cyberdyne factory sends shivers down my spine, because the animation looks so scary - a brilliant piece of directing by James Cameron. This is were Terminator 3 failed, because the CGI (computer generated images) just isn't scary. One things for sure, you can't beat hand produced special effects, and Stan Winston has done a stunning job. in both T1 and T2.<br/><br/>Of course, this film has some great acting in it as well. Micheal Biehn does a good job of not being able to adapt to 1984. What I like is the good choice of actors. Neither the character Kyle Reese or Sarah Connor are absolute superstars that have glamorous looks, and thats why Cameron chose them. He made us see how the character of Sarah Connor could have happened to any one. (providing they have an unborn son, as you'll see in the film)And as Sarah keeps asking herself in the film ""why me?"" Cameron doesn't need to unravel an answer, but suggests that she is just a normal citizen, who has been given this terrible ordeal. But in kyle Reese's (Micheal Biehn) eye, she is very important.<br/><br/>Cameron uses some good directing techniques, especially with the music. The theme tune has a simple electronic style to it, but it stays in you head for ages! But for a low budget movie, music composer Brad Fiedel does a great job, mixing tension, with classic piano music in the scene were Sarah and kyle spend a bit of time 'in bed'. The piano music immediately reminded me of the piano music used in Titanic. So it seems Cameron hasn't lost his touch for music.<br/><br/>By the 2 disc special edition DVD to get extra features, including commentary, trailers, 'the making of T1' and some deleted scenes, which I have been puzzled why there were deleted. One shows some FBI or special agents removing the terminators main chip right at the end, and slips it inot his pocket, explaining how it got to the cyberdyne factory in T2.<br/><br/>You really can't fault this film. For a low budget film, its been put together simply and the outcome is great."

Arnold cast as a cold killing machine that rarely if ever speaks was the best use of his natural performing talent as will ever be chosen. He was simply awesome and not cheesy at all. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton were also really great. The ending of this movie was fantastic. The storm coming and the loneliness of it all for Sarah Connor.

The great director James Cameron never fails at being a good Director, deff capturing the scenes of a fallen earth where machines are now taking control and the humans are the prey. WARNING SPOILERS: This movie begins in like i said a disastrous world where machines rule. A leader of the humans, John Connor is introduced. Back to the present (1984) Where a electrical disturbance brings a huge man the infamous Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was deff the right choice for this no one could have did it better. His mild dialogue in this movie makes up in his one liners, where he says lines better then we could say them. Also from the future comes another character, Micheal Bein. Both there missions are to find Sara Connor, future mother of John Connor future leader of the human race in the future. But the catch is that, One is looking to Protect her, and one is there to Kill her. Arnold is a Terminator meaning his human flesh over metal endoskeleton.

","When The Terminator came out in 1984, it launched Arnold Schwarzenegger into super-stardom and established its director James Cameron as one of Hollywood's most talented directors by becoming one of the most successful movies of the year. The story of a cyborg brought back through time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, a woman who's unborn son will become a military leader and help mankind fight the machines who will take over the world in a near-future captivated movie-goers everywhere around the world. The movie was shot with a $6 million budget and ended up grossing more than $80 million worldwide and became a sci-fi classic among fans. Although the movie was overshadowed by its 1991 super-sequel, T2, The Terminator stands on its own and manages to give good thrills and great action sequences even with its small budget. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect in is landmark role as a fearless mean-killing machine who has no remorse and no pity for poor Sarah Connor who's life changes after Kyle Reese, a soldier who was also sent back from the future to protect Sarah against the terminator. Linda Hamilton is excellent and so is Michael Biehn as Sarah's love interest and father of her son, Kyle Reese.

","The Terminator is a 1984 movie starring Arnold Schwarzennegar and Linda Hamilton, and it is independent. James Cameron made this before he got the big bucks from Aliens and went on to make Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

Arnold's character has become classic now, and Cameron builds tension and real, actual horror from this creation instead of relying solely on special effects. This movie is called a thriller but should also be called a horror, because the way the Terminator chases Linda Hamilton and Nick Stahl is something to be truly feared, even if he is a robot. This movie is a futuristic allegory, full of meaning, full of thrills. One of cinema's most famous lines is ""I'll be back."" and it is from this movie. But this movie has never left.

I wont starting telling you a plot because everyone knows it. At that time it was just called B movie. Studios didnt think that Terminator would be such a commercial and critical hit. It launched James Camerons and Arnold Schwarzeneggers to sky. Cameron become Hollywoods respect director and Arnie became actionstar. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton did amazing perfomances. The movies budget was only 8 million dollars but still movie rocks!! Of cource special effects are bit old but it doesnt take the pleasure of seeing this movie. Cameron is such srong and good director that this could be made on limited budget. Buy special edition Dvd and I promise you will enjoy the extramaterial. James Cameron also wrote Arnies legendary line ""I´ll be back"". That became Arnolds trademark in his films. Checkout Bill Paxton in the beginning of the film as one of the punks. In Kyles dream when Terminators attack humans shelterbase check Stuntman and Arnolds Frien Franco Columbu as Terminator. Ultimate classic! See it if you havent seen in it already. Terminator fans write me! ""I´LL BE BACK"""

","In the near future, a powerful computer run by SkyNet is entrusted to make almost every computerized aspect of human life fully automated, and is in charge of almost everything including missle defense. The computer begins to ""think"" for itself and sees the human race as a threat, and decides to attempt to wipe it out by starting a worldwide nuclear war, killing most of the world's population. The survivors are left to fight the machines and attempt to regain control. They are lead by a powerful man named John Connor who teaches them to fight back against the machines whilst on the brink of extinction. The humans almost succeed in exterminating the machines that have kept them slaves for decades, but as a result SkyNet sends a cybernetic organism called a terminator back in time to kill John Connor's mother before he is even born, thus removing the threat of him altogether. John Connor decides this cannot happen and decides to send back a soldier to the past to protect his mother, and himself, from the terminator. The fight for the future will be fought in the past. Man vs. machine. Sorry for that, like it was needed.<br/><br/>Very possibly the best action film of all time, with the exception of it's sequel, and executed with a bunch of no name actors and a shoestring budget...not to mention a director with almost no experience, it's an amazing feat to say the least. It's been 20 years since it's release, and while some special effects have aged inevitably, the effect of the movie itself has not. <br/><br/>Linda Hamilton, Arnold (I'm not even going to try and spell that last name), and especially, the cult following worthy Michael Biehn for his characters alone, all give good performances. The film has a few very minor flaws, but is not reflective onto the enjoyment or quality factor. The action and the story are all paced nicely, has excellent direction, the characters have are well developed, and the overall content is quite impressive. The movie is fairly simple, but is extremely effective. Terminator has been deemed a classic and respectfully so. I'm sure it will provide a great movie experience for myself and others for many years to come. The idea of a machine sent to kill you that is all but unstoppable, without any remorse or hesitation, is very chilling and is one of the film's main reasons for such success. I don't need to say any more, you've seen it. Needless to say, this film started many careers of those involved. Classic.<br/><br/>An absolute must for any action or sci-fi fan's collection."

","I like all the Terminator movies about the same; they all have their strengths and weaknesses so I rank them all a nine.  This one looks very dated now and some of the special effects just don't look so hot, but it still is a fun movie to watch as Arnold plays the killing machine very well. His prey, Sarah Connor played very well by Linda Hamilton.  The story is good and there is lots of action and excitement.  This one goes pretty quick too, unlike the second one which has places in it that drags a bit.  Of course it makes up for the slow parts by having better effects than this one.  This one has many memorable scenes, the most memorable being the Terminator's attack on the police station.  There are a couple of Cameron staples here as Michael Biehan and Lance Henrikson are in it.  They appear in other Cameron movies as well.  Bill Paxton even has a small role in this one.  All in all a very good sci-fi action movie that is entertaining and exciting even though it is a bit dated now."

","Of all the 1980's science fiction movies to come out, I think this one was one of my favorites. It was so very unique and original a story as to fully capture the imagination. The animatronics they used for the Terminator was so realistic without ever coming off as contrived or phony. Even when they used the obvious dummy for Schwarzenegger's face right after he took out his eyeball, it looked good. If they had had the techniques in CGI we have now, it would have been much better, but alas! They did not.<br/><br/>This was an excellent story which was well-executed, and was far greater than the sum of its parts. I loved it through and through. It's hard to believe they made this movie for less than 10M. <br/><br/>Great acting, wonderful plot, good effects, and excellent direction make for a blockbuster hit for years to come.<br/><br/>A definite must-have for all fans of the sci-fi/action genres.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.0/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"DavidSim240183","10","0","1","26 December 2003"," Arnie's finest hour.
","The Terminator was one of the many films I grew up with as a child. It was what started off my fascination with science-fiction. The aspects of time-travel are very interesting, and in the case of this film, it demonstrates what a fundamental impact it can have on the world altering the events of yesterday to affect tomorrow.<br/><br/>I imagine just about everyone in the world must have seen the Terminator, since this is the film that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger's film career. This is by far his best film (and performance) when compared to some of his later films.<br/><br/>The Terminator begins in the future, 2029 A.D. amongst the ruins of Los Angeles. This is indeed a grim, bleak vision of the future, since there has been a nuclear war, and a war that is currently raging between man and machine. A sophisticated computer, Skynet, has declared war on the human race. Ironically, Skynet was built by humans to act as a defence for humanity. But the computer became self-aware, and decided all people were a threat. So it began the system-wide extermination of the human race.<br/><br/>To carry this out, Skynet has built an army of machines to destroy humanity. But a young man, John Connor, formed a resistance movement, and managed to turn the war to our favour. But Skynet is not so easily defeated. It sends a machine called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), back through time to 1984, to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) before she can give birth to John.<br/><br/>In response, the resistance sends one of their soldiers, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back through time to intercept the Terminator before it carries out its mission. Reese must protect Sarah at all costs, or humanity's future is doomed.<br/><br/>Arnie is perfectly cast as the Terminator (or T-101), because he manages to give a very believable performance of a machine. He portrays the Terminator as something that is not clouded by compassion or feeling. Completely emotionless. He will hunt down Sarah to the ends of the Earth if necessary to complete his deadly mission. There is a great scene when Reese is describing to Sarah what it is they're up against:<br/><br/>""Listen, and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead.""<br/><br/>Arnie is utterly without mercy, tracking down Sarah with total efficiency and clinical detachment. He murders people left, right and centre in his pursuit of Sarah. He allows nothing to stand in his way. Probably the scariest aspect to Arnie's character is he is not evil. He is just doing what he has been programmed to do. If that means committing unspeakable acts to complete his mission, then so be it.<br/><br/>The film is extremely suspenseful, as the Terminator cuts a swathe of destruction in pursuit of Sarah. One of the best scenes is when Sarah is in a police station, and the Terminator just barges right in and kills nearly 20 policemen. This is a brilliant example of how single-minded the Terminator is. That scene alone was probably influenced by Assault on Precinct 13, but still the scene is a moment of shocking intensity.<br/><br/>Both Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton put in good performances. Sarah's character shows a great deal of evolution in this film. At first, she is a slightly scatty waitress. But when told she is the mother of the future, her experiences harden her until she becomes a brave soldier in the face of adversity. The stunning climax really shows how far she has come from her introduction at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn's performance is pretty good, because the audience is not really sure what to make of him at first. The script constantly keeps you guessing, and for all we know, Reese might be the bad guy too. He's got a good chemistry with Linda Hamilton, and we get to see his world through his eyes. The scenes of war-torn L.A. are good, and shows the constant struggle humanity must contend with against the machines they created in the first place.<br/><br/>Because this was James Cameron's first feature film, it has a rather modest budget when compared to the other two films. Wisely, Cameron uses suspense to keep the audience hooked. Some of the chase scenes are helped no end by the pounding music from composer Brad Fiedel. They feel even more gripping, and send chills down my spine. <br/><br/>Admittedly, the FX have dated considerably. E.g. the scene when Arnie must remove one of his human eyes. Other technologies like CGI were only in their infancy at this stage. But still, the endoskeleton looks very impressive, and still scares me at the film's finale.<br/><br/>There is a very interesting paradox involving Sarah's son, but for those who haven't seen the film, I won't reveal it. Some of the science seems rather nonsensical, but when talking about time-travel, there are lots of unanswered questions. The paradox is explained further in the other two films, so you may not completely understand the paradox until you've seen all the films in the trilogy.<br/><br/>The film that introduced Arnie's catchphrase ""I'll be back"" has never sounded better then in this film. Arnie's movements, mannerisms are all perfect. Everything about this film is superb, and is the best of the Terminator trilogy. From the great beginning and that theme music, to the shocking outcome. It constantly keeps you guessing, and hits you right between the eyes with all of the intensity of an unrelenting nightmare.<br/><br/>Simply marvellous."

","James Cameron's best, most original piece of work. Forget T2: Judgment Day (actually, it's great sequel to this great original), Titanic etc. The Terminator started it all, long before Cameron was sailing with Leonardo DiCaprio on that stupid love-boat. Forget every other Schwarzenegger movie, this one started it all. Arnold's best work yet! He was brilliant as this walking hunk of machinery, why? Because that's what he seems to be; a monstorous, mechanincal tyrant, a cold blooded killer. Michael Biehn defined the phrase ""action star."" He play Sgt. Kyle Reese like a flute, note for note. He plays his character with emotion, energy and depth, much better than most Hollywood ""action stars."" Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was just fine, I didn't find anything about her performance dazzling, but it was good. This movie is called The Terminator, but the stars of it are Reese and Connor. Without Reese, there was no story to the events taking place, without him, we'd have no idea about what was going on. And, like most movies, this one is about a girl, Sarah Connor, once the girl next door, a simple college student and part time waitress, who becomes wrapped up in the future in the making. Story summary: In the year 2029, machines, that humans built to serve them, have taken over, and now the humans either serve them, or fight against them. The leader of a Resistance force, John Connor, learns of the machines devious plot to kill him. The machines; Skynet, will send back their ultimate weapon; a highly advanced, cold-blooded killing machine, a Terminator. Skynet will send back a Terminator (Schwazenegger) to the year 1984, nine months before John Connor would be born, by killing his mother. John sends back the first volunteer to 1984 to protect her, Sgt. Kyle Reese. With Reese to protect her, teach her, and guide her, Sarah Connor must survive this ordeal, or the human race is doomed. The odds are not good, Reese with no modern weapons or help must protect Sarah, or die trying.<br/><br/>Intelligent, original, and insightful film that would remain a classic to date. I rate it 9 out of 10 for a great story, wonderful acting, and superb directing. A good start for the up and coming James Cameron, the maker of Titanic-woopty friggin' doo, Titanic-Schmranic, The Terminator is without a doubt, much better."

Linda Hamilton was never what you'd call talented and Michael Biehn never saw the success that he deserves.<br/><br/>James Cameron's greatest talent lies in creating great setpieces and backdrops for his stories. He also has an eye for action, and The Terminator has plenty of both. The makeup effects are a bit primitive even for the time but they were cool then and they still work now. The Terminator's vision is always been a cool effect to me but it is used sparingly in this film. The action and gunplay are some of the best ever seen in an Arnold or Cameron film and that's saying something. Bottom Line: The Terminator is a classic that doesn't get old and never gets boring.

","Terminator, The<br/><br/>½* out of five<br/><br/>(Possible spoilers throughout)<br/><br/>It has been a couple months since its theatrical release, but now I am finally set to see Terminator 3. In preparation, I re-watched the movie that got the franchise started. Admittedly, I saw Terminator once before, as a pre-teen whose intellectual capacity had not yet developed to the level necessary to understand a film with such profound questions about time-travel, humanity, and the man-made proliferation of killer robots. My brain was simply too puny to appreciate the film. Or was it? As it turns out, it was not.<br/><br/>The story is insultingly simple: Two men from the post-nuclear holocaust future travel back in time to the present day (1984) to try and alter the course of history. The bad guy (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cyborg who is programmed to kill (or `terminate') the central character Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose son will grow up to become an influential human leader. Preventing the Terminator is the good guy, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a human who is trying to protect his own race from total annihilation.<br/><br/>That's as complicated as it gets. There is only a superficial treatment of the time-travel questions, as it is obvious that writer/director James Cameron is using the plot as a flimsy pretext to showcase a worn-out tale of good guy vs. bad guy. Terminator has the potential to be a pumped-up drama that demands the viewer to ponder his or her own fragile existence. Instead, this potential is sullied--demolished might be the word--by Cameron's almost psychotic drive to pack the movie end-to-end with gunshots, homemade-bomb explosions, car chases, door kick-downs, punching, and brawling, the sum of which renders the plot completely irrelevant.<br/><br/>The Terminator also fails as a 'popcorn flick', not because of a lack of violence, but because of a lack of acting skill among the central characters. The bit characters (like Sarah Connor's roommate Ginger) do a horrible job performing their parts; this is forgivable however, because the viewer does not expect much from expendable characters. However, we cannot forgive Biehn's phony jacked-up let's-get-'em-before-they-get-us demeanor that is so over-the-top it makes me wonder how much PCP this actor was taking at the time. Nor can we forgive Hamilton's job as an innocent, frightened flower who unwillingly gets caught in the middle of the bloody battle between Terminator and Reese. Her amateur-hour rookie performance is simply too shoddy to accept. (Perhaps all this is forgivable considering the fact that the budget for this movie probably ran in the tens of dollars range-if that.)<br/><br/>I was, however, relieved to see some inspired acting on Schwarzenegger's behalf. Never before had I seen someone so devoted to the art of oak tree imitation. This man is certainly one of the great method actors in film history.<br/><br/>The climax takes place in (ahem) what looks to be a robot factory. After Terminator's severed, mechanical torso springs back to life (the sole moment which earned the movie its generous rating) and begins to pursue our heroine Sarah Connor (these Terminators just never stop), I was reminded of the last time I felt such a rush of adrenaline: last week, when I eagerly waited for my strawberry Pop Tart to toast.<br/><br/>At the start of the movie, the attentive viewer will notice a disclaimer written in tiny letters. It reads: `Please disconnect brain from body, and don't ask any questions.' But be sure to reconnect your brain at the end of the movie, so you can figure out what the hell you just watched."

","This movie is about some kind of robot who lands in a puddle of light whenever he comes to earth.  He is so muscular that clothes do not time travel or something like that.  He has skin on him and is naked when he goes to Earth.  He is a mean robot who has limited speaking skills.  I would think that in the hear 2034 that they would have some better schools where they could teach the scientists how to make the robots speak more clear. The Robot, played by former Mr. Universe, Arnold Schwartnegger, is a TERMINATOR.  I mean, that's all he can think about is killing this one lady so that she doesn't have this kid who grows up to kill the Terminator.  The chases are always frustrating because the robot doesn't get tired.  He is kind of like the paste.  The Paste will never get tired but the humans will. The Robot punches people in the guts and also says that he will be back a lot.  One of the huge mistakes that James Cameron made when directing this movie, was that he forgot to give the Robot any emotions.  Without emotions, the robot can't decide what is wrong and what is right.   If he would have had that ability, he would have killed better and would have killed that lady who was going to give birth to Jack Connor.  The Robots are going to kill anyway, so why not make it so that they can kill in a better method rather than just killing killing and killing.  I think this is the worst movie of the 1980s and perhaps of all time."
"shanfloyd","8","0","1","2 August 2003"," Seeing the film in today's point of view...
","Commenting on this film after watching Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was not easy. I've seen it for seven or eight times before this. So when I sat before my TV to watch it again, just a day after I saw T3 in theatre, it gave me a new idea. That the Terminator (1984) never meant to be a sci-fi eye candy based on raw action, which T2 and more precisely T3 have become. It should be classified into some sci-fi horror to be more perfect. That creepy Terminator model, that gory look of Schwarzenegger, the night based story and especially that background music--- all meant to create a feeling of horror or dark thriller, never a die-hard action flick. I don't know if seeing this film in the perspective of that era, early 80's, could tell a different thing. But to be an action movie in today's eyes, Terminator is not sufficient.<br/><br/>Years before The Matrix presented us the very idea that in near future machines or self-aware computer programs will enslave the human race, there came this thing... SkyNet. Perhaps to deal with this concept was not Cameron's primary goal in this rather low budget superhit. His intention was to make another cult film. Success was much higher than expected, it's true. But that is not my point. I just mean if Terminator was made in late 90's, not back in '84, it would have been a much more different movie. Inevitably the major focus had to be on the basic concept, not Arnold building his muscles in the rooftop. I realise in sudden horror that it might not cast Arnold as well... since a killing machine doesn't have to be a Mr. Universe in figure. And in today's eyes, it would surely be an absurd idea too to an indie filmmaker.<br/><br/>Whether Terminator would succeed if made now as much as it did back then is a different story. All that is important is its effect on filmmakers thereafter. It was a flawed film, true. But it created a genre of its own. It was highly extraordinary, even in the eyes of present-day post-Matrix viewers. That skin-on-one-side look of Arnie's face became a trademark; his ""I'll be back"" became a legend. This film generated several inspired works but few equals. I know exactly why T2 is a different movie at all. Terminator is a classic of its own kind."
"ed_zeppelin","10","0","1","27 July 2003"," I was brought up with this film
","In the battle between The Terminator and Terminator 2, the original often loses out. This is unfair. I have seen both films more times than is good for me and I rank the original as being far superior. The second one feels very Hollywood, like it was made by a bunch of businessmen. The first one was done for no reason other than to make a great film. This is refreshing in this day and age, and the film carries it off perfectly.<br/><br/>Most of the reasons for its derision are unfair.<br/><br/>First reason: ""It is low budget, consequently with bad special effects"". Personally, I like the special effects. I like stop motion animation. I like good model work-and the model work is exceptional.<br/><br/>Second reason: ""Not enough action scenes."" There are less action scenes than T2, I admit. But T2 seems to hinge on action scenes, which are hugely overblown and excessive. T1 has one great centrepiece-the police station massacre. This action scene is simple, unpretentious, and utterly utterly spellbinding.<br/><br/>Third reason: ""It is very 80s, and looks dated"". It is dated, yes, but this does not work against it in the way that it does for, say, ""The Lost Boys"". It features ordinary people of that period-not EVERYONE wore excessively ridiculous clothes and styles. Also, the music is actually very good. I am not a fan of 80s music, but this is actually great-the Terminator theme song here is better than anywhere else-mournful and haunting, not melodramatically orchestral like in T2.<br/><br/>Special mention #1 mention must go to the scenes set in the future. These are brilliant, oozing with atmosphere. In T2 the human fighters are a tightly regimented band of marines running around in uniforms. Here they are dressed in rags, living in holes in the ground, and eating rats. The effect is startling and scary, and the grainy nature of the picture works well.<br/><br/>Special mention #2 goes to Arnold Schwarzenegger. His performance is fantastic, and is what makes the film so great. His utter lack of emotion is the key; in the sequels the Terminators occasionally showed flashes of emotion, to their detriment, but here he is totally inhuman. This purist approach, which includes giving him only a handful of lines, actually makes the one hint of him being something other than a monster (when he smooths down his hair) work well.<br/><br/>His lines are excellent, and not at all cheesy-even the infamous ""I'll be back."" When this was written it was not a cheesy catchphrase, just another line that works well in the context of the scene-and it shows. It BECAME cheesy when it was used in every film Scwarzenegger made over the next fifteen years.<br/><br/>I hope when you see it you recognise that almost all of the criticism levelled against it is unfair. If you have a piece of criticism that you think it deserves, let me know.<br/><br/>P.S, It sounds like I don't like T2. I like it very much, but it gains more praise than perhaps it deserves compared to the original."

There is some very good acting by Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn and of course Arnold...because even if he doesn't say so much (but ""I'll be back"" is to damn good) he looks like a regular tough guy with absolutely no feelings...he does the role excellent, that role was made for Arnold. I heard that James Cameron was going to cast Jürgen Prochnow or Lance Henriksen in the role of the terminator...thank good i changed his mind."

","Arnold Schwarzenegger makes an imposing presence as a cyborg sent back in time to terminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to change history, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier from the future sent to thwart Schwarzenegger's plans. The Terminator is a movie that defined the term Sci-Fi/Action movie , this classic is so well put together that it's scary, indeed for a 7 million dollar movie this is quite an impressive feat. Even though it spawned a worthwhile sequel, this one gets by just on raw energy as well as first rate acting where as the sequel relied on special effects to tell the story. Overall The Terminator is a movie that should not ever be missed."
"averjee","10","0","1","6 July 2003"," One of the best fils of the 1980s
","Science fiction succeeds when it combines technical achievements with a human dimension.  THE TERMINATOR is one of the greatest films ever to hit the big screen, mainly for this reason.  The hero is ostensibly John Connor, a man who will later becoem the savior of mankind.  But in this story, he isn't even born yet - machines rule the world in 2029, and are fighting a losing battle against human rebels, led by Connor.  They hatch a plot to send a killing machine back in time, to kill Sarah Connor, John's mother.<br/><br/>The human rebels manage to send a human hero back (his name is Kyle Reese), to stop the machine known as ""The Terminator"" - and what follows is a powerful action film, and a poignant love story, as Sarah and her savior fall in love.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>In the original casting of the film, the hero's role was supposed to go to Arnold Schwarzenegger, while the ""Terminator"" itself was supposed to be played by Lance Henriksen, an excellent character actor who has appeared in films like ALIEN and THE HUNTED.<br/><br/>The Terminator was originally conceived to be more an ""infiltration unit,"" one that would not stand out in common society.  (In fact, reference is made to this in the film itself - Kyle Reese cannot identify the Terminator until it actually attempted to assassinate Sarah.)<br/><br/>Cameron and Schwarzenegger eventually decided to put Arnold int othe role of the Terminator, and Michael Biehn was broguht in to play Reese.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger's greatest successes as a movie star have come in roles where his physical and vocal characteristics are consistent with the character. (Think CONAN, TRUE LIES and TOTAL RECALL.)  Here, he is perfectly cast as a brutal, remorseless, emotion-less killing machine - the straight man in a human drama.<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger is chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy, and this roel cemented him as the pre-eminent action star of our time."
"Beast-5","Null","0","1","6 July 2003"," A classic
","THE TERMINATOR is an excellent movie, a true science fiction classic. James Cameron really captures the grimy underside of Los Angeles. The characters are vivid and sympathetic and Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only guy who could have played the Terminator. I've heard complaints<br/><br/>about how violent this movie is,and there are violent scenes,but there's also a compelling plot."
"LebowskiT1000","10","0","2","6 July 2003"," Sci-fi/Action done right!
","James Cameron deserves a lot of credit or hatching this incredible story and brilliant idea!  This is one of the best told sci-fi/action stories out there.  The action never stops, the story makes complete sense, the acting is great, the special effects are top-notch (given the year that it was made) and the make-up effects / creature designs are phenomenal.<br/><br/>All of the actors involved pull off fantastic performances.  Particularly Arnold Schwarzenegger (although he has VERY few lines in the film), Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton, Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen.  Also, keep a watchful eye for Bill Paxton in the beginning of the film, as one of the punks that has a rendezvous with The Terminator.<br/><br/>The special effects and make-up effects are outstanding, given that the film was made back in 1984.  By todays standards some of the effects aren't very impressive and at a few times they're actually rather silly looking, but nonetheless well done.  But there are a few times that are just as good as today's special effects and are simply jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about the film is the music at a few points in the film.  It's not really that bad, it just brands the film as an OBVIOUS 80's film.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the story is just spectacular and told perfectly well.  The story fluidly unfolds from scene to scene and definitely keeps your attention.  If you are one of the few people out there that hasn't seen this film and likes science fiction movies, you should DEFINITELY check this film out, there's something for everyone in this film.  Although, be warned that this NOT a film for children, it definitely has an R rating for a reason. Do yourself a favor and go see this film, I hope you enjoy it.

"What92691","10","0","1","4 July 2003"," A classic Sci-Fi thriller, that took Science Fiction to a bigger height
","The Terminator is now a days a film that people judge there thrills with. After they've walked out of the theater from seing a thriller, they compare it to this one. The Terminator took the Thriller genre to an even bigger height, the Terminator to Science Fiction to a bigger height, The Terminator took cinema to a bigger height. These kind of movies started out with Alien (when I mean these kind of movies, I mean Science Fiction Thrillers, with a whole bunch of guns, not like Invasion of The Body Snatchers) went to The Thing, and then came The Terminator. The Terminator changed cinema by the stunning special effects, the tremendous plot, and story that can't get better, the creative villian that won't stop till he kills. Also in most Science Fiction films you don't have much romance, in this one you do. This also continued with a woman being the heroe in a Science Fiction film, before Alien (the movie that kind of started for woman being heroes in Science Fiction films)there wasn't a lot. The Terminator also like Alien, kept you guessing till the end, thinking is he going to get killed now, or who will get killed. Other compliments for the film are the acting, which is tremendous, Arnold Schwarzenegger makes you really fell that the villian is really bad, he makes a good job of playing a computer. Linda Hamilton is excellent because she does a great job of being scared. The writing is great, this film created a line that everybody knowes: ""I'll be back,"" one of the most famous lines, right up there with ""Bond, James Bond."" If you haven't seen this film, and you love shooting, and Science Fiction, then I suggest you rent this one. Out of four stars, it's a definite ****. I'll be back."
"mr composer","9","0","1","24 June 2003"," Arnie's Best
","It's been a while since I last saw this movie. With T3 coming out soon, which thus far I've no desire to see, it's had me remembering the first two installments of this series. Both are well done, but there are a lot of reasons I prefer this original movie.<br/><br/>1. The freshness of it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was relatively unknown (except for Conan the Barbarian fans)as an actor. James Cameron was unknown as a director. Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn were all unknowns. It is a straightforward story with incredible tension.<br/><br/>2. Arnold makes a better bad guy than good guy.  This is my biggest reason for preferring the original. Arnold doesn't say much more than a dozen words. Being unknown, he's viewed less as Schwarzenegger playing yet another action role, and more as the character himself - a superstrong, persistent, unstoppable terminator with no conscience.<br/><br/>3. The dark tone of the film.  T2 is a load of fun, but it's a blatantly intended summer film. It's choreographed with scenes that just pack it in for the box office. Terminator is anything but this, being sinister and foreboding. It's my impression that this was a nice personal project from Cameron that started this franchise when it had as much success as it did, but even more so when Arnold's box-office status really took off.<br/><br/>----------{Spoiler Alert!}------------<br/><br/>I have two main drawbacks with this film. The special effects with the bare terminator were probably cutting-edge at the time.  But it looks so much like a cartoon super-imposed in the wide-angle shots.<br/><br/>Then there is the paradox of John Connor's conception. It's not enough to diminish the entertainment value of this movie, but this one absurdity stands out since everything else (given a 1984 viewpoint of world history and politics) seems at least possible.  It does make for an entertaining twist to discover Kyle Reese as the father.  But it can't help but rack your brain to think... how can John Connor send Kyle back on this assignment, if he has not yet gone to conceive him?  But I know by now this is a tired argument.  Like I said, it's still highly entertaining, but sticks out as the biggest absurdity<br/><br/>---------{END SPOILER ALERT}-------<br/><br/>One last interesting note is the inclusion of Franco Columbu as the future terminator, who in real life was one of Arnold's best friends and bodybuilding competitors."

"eamon-hennedy","9","0","1","23 May 2003"," What the 1980's were all about.
","This is a genuinely great film in every regards. James Cameron has crafted a film that works on so many emotional and story telling levels, it was an early sign of what a great talent he was going to be in future years (even if the budgets were to get out of control). To start of The Termintator works as a great science fiction/time travel story, but transends that and goes of into other fantastic realms as Cameron takes the film and turns it into a great gothic love story, a nightmarish thriller and a story of irony and love. It is a classic film and one that defines the 80's. Where he suceeds most is with his story. Cameron's abilities as a story teller is what makes him one of the best directors working today and the story of Sarah Connor and the battle to either save or end her life is compulsive film and is dealt with with great assurance from Cameron as he takes full control of the screenplay and the direction, squeezing every emotion and inch of suspense for all it is worth.<br/><br/>It is no surprise to see that Arnie went on to bigger and better things after this film. His performance in this film is that of sheer menace. The lack of emotion and that cold, icy face makes the character an icon, even if he is such an evil person (thing). While saying half a dozen lines, looking evil and firing lots of guns isn't what you would call a great performance, Arnie turns it into an art form and showed everybody in 1984 that this guy could just be the next best thing.<br/><br/>If Arnie (sorry for calling him that, I can't spell his surname) is the evil centre of the story, then Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are the emotional centre, the love story that develops between them heartbreaking at the end, but one which throughout the film gives us a sense of optimism. Their performances are fantastic, especially Hamilton, and the development of their characters is spot on.<br/><br/>It is no surprise that Cameron went on to bigger and better things after this, but the film is still a monumental one and one that is often associated with him, even if it is a low budget thriller. While the sequel would go on to be better (in my opinion), it is the sheer horror and viciousness of this film as well as the performance of Arnie that will always make us remember this one even more."
"Fidel_Castro","10","0","1","22 August 2003"," The birth of the best trilogy ever.
","I've seen this film a number of times and I never get tired of it. When I first saw it and checked the year of the film and saw it to be 1984 I was gobsmacked and I thought to myself. ""Woah this film is seriously ahead of its time."" And it truly was. The plot itself has everything action, love, suspense, emotion and a great ending. The acting is first class aswell with superb displays from Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Michael Bhien as Kyle Reese and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator which began an oddessy of action films for the Austrian star. As for the storyline its out of this world and is surely Cameron's brainchild. As for the premise Kyle Reese and the Terminator have been sent from the future with two different objectives, the terminator's is to kill Sarah Connor so that her unborn, unconcieved son John Connor never sees light of day. Reese's is to protect Sarah from the Terminator. Who is John Connor? John Connor is the leader of a human resistance that fights against an uprising by enhanced machines after a nuclear bomb launched onto LA. So overall the best movie of the 80's by far and always will be a classic so I give this a 10/10 sheer genius."

","This is one of the most well known sci-fi action films out there, and why not.  Its packed with solid action, a good plot, and good direction. The only thing was the special FX, but considering the film's budget and that it was 1984, they are not bad. But comparing them to today's they are kind of weak.  But besides that, this is one hell of an action film.  Arnie's does'nt say much but he does a good as the title character.  I also thought Michael Beihn gave a good performance as the rebel soldier sent back to protect Linda Hamilton.  The action scene's were also solid, especially the car chases and the shootout at the police station.  In all a highly recommended film, especially for fans of Arnold as well as sci-fi action film's.  4/5"

(Terminator 2 is very good also). What i dont like is some people say that its just a action movie. But i think it gives important messages to everybody. In year the 2003, the world is in a big chaos as we all know. A world war like in the movie is not so impossible maybe. And technology captures the world... We feel lost without technology. I think it is a warning for what might have happen in future..."
"guy_geoffroychateau","10","0","1","22 January 2003"," the most important change in sci-fi history
","Before The Terminator was launched in the cinema's, science-fiction was always the same: people floating around in space in their spaceships, discovering new planets with evil aliens, and the brave, heroic astronauts of course win all the battles. All these movies like: Star Trek, Star Wars, Battle Star Galactica, etc. started really to bore the people. Of course Star Trek and Star Wars were pretty cool, but after those movies, the rip-off sci-fi started. Until 1984. This year was an important year for the science-fiction, because this is the story: in 2029 the world is in hands of the machines, which are raised out of the nuclear mess after the Nuclear War. But the machines are almost defeated by mankind, thanks to their leader John Connor. But the machines sent a advanced cyborg back to 1984 to kill the mother of this leader: Sarah Connor. The humans sent also a fighter back to protect sarah and make sure that John Connor will be born.<br/><br/>Nobody could ever make a science-fiction with a story like this, but after The Terminator, there came a lot of movies like this. Movies like: Cyborg, Timecop and many more. Another important thing of The Terminator are the actors. In The Terminator are exactly the right actors chosen and so is the music. This all together makes The Terminator a classic sci-fi movie"

The story of Sarah Connor and The Terminator really blew me away first time I watched it, as a kid. The only times I actually were allowed to watch it was when I was sick and had to stay home and my mother permitted me to watch it. I was so happy, those were the times!<br/><br/>Well, The Terminator has a fantastic dark atmosphere unlike T2, really underlining the scary story being told. The score also has great influence on this matter; it has a very dark and edgy feel to it, however the main theme is kind of sad. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a perfect cast as the cynical Terminator and he would be hard to imagine playing the hero, since Michael Biehn does it very well.<br/><br/>James Cameron laid his ground on this movie making a lot of top-notch movies; still this is one of his best. There are many memorable scenes, although the ""cat scene"" is the best, I really like the way the Terminator and the motel-guy talks: AY BAHDEE YA GAT A DEAD GAT IN DER ER WHAT? FAWK-YOU-ASS-WHOLE.<br/><br/>The special effects, however, are all but mind-blowing. I didn't notice it when I was kid, but now e.g. it looks really funny when we see the endoskeleton walk around.

I heard the idea came from and old Outer Limits episode, from the early 60's, starring Lenord Neymod (Spock) as the robot.
