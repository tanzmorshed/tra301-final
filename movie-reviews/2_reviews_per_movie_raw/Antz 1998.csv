"Motoko","Null","50","62","17 February 1999"," Watch this and enjoy it. Kids optional.
","The trouble with making a children's film has always been to keep the kids happy but avoid making Mum and Dad fall asleep. Disney have always stuck to a solid ""one cute song for every acidic aside"" ratio which meant that the over-15's got Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy doing a stripped down routine whilst the 10 year olds got pretty pictures, cute animals and plenty of slapstick. This is what has made the House of Mouse the dominant toon makers but their mastery is under attack from Dreamworks SKG. While Walt & Co. delivered Mulan, Mr. Spielberg gave us Prince of Egypt and though Disney won, narrowly, the next round isn't going to be so easy.<br/><br/>Antz is brilliant. Don't let anybody tell you differently. We've got stunning visuals, great jokes, some brilliant scenes and some very likeable characters. What we have is a very smart film. Maybe too smart. The jokes are funny if you're old enough to get them. The sight of a neurotic ant lying on a therapist's leaf complaining about his anxious childhood is hilarious. Especially when the biggest neurotic in the world, Woody Allen, is delivering the lines. His timing, throughout the entire film, is exquisite and the script takes advantage of this at every opportunity i.e.:<br/><br/>Mandible: I like an ant that laughs in the face of death.<br/><br/>Z: Actually I stand behind Death and make belittling comments at its back.<br/><br/>It reads like one of Woody's early, funny films (sorry, but I couldn't resist it) and the rest of the cast are good too but that's because the script takes advantage of their history. Weaver acts like Stallone, Cutter acts like Walken and Barbatus acts like Glover. Anybody that's seen one of their films instantly recognises the voice behind the ant because of how they speak and act. They also bypass the sing-along route and insert a grisly battle sequence similar to Starship Troopers. The adults in the audience will love it. Children may be a little underwhelmed.<br/><br/>How many kids have seen an Allen, Stallone or Walken film? Not many I expect. How many kids have seen Troopers or Metropolis, (which is a big inspiration for the visuals)? Very few. There are a lot of jokes they just won't get. They may enjoy the pretty pictures but there's a distinct lack of cuddly animals, obvious slapstick or happy tunes. Boredom may set in and there may be a few cries during the battle sequence so be ready. Another downside is a slightly weak villain. Hackman does well with what he has but it's not much and truly cool bad guys like James Woods' Hades run circles round him.<br/><br/>Despite that Antz is a blast. As funny and enjoyable for adults as a child-orientated flick could be. It's not the best toon but it's a definite step forward. Maybe Disney have finally met their match."
"FairlyAnonymous","8","29","35","27 June 2011"," Very underrated movie, this is one of Dreamworks' best
","Antz is an animated movie that wasn't appreciated upon its initial release. After the family friendly movie Toy Story, I feel like people weren't ready for something a little bit darker, and more intense. This movie has death (and a lot of it at that), it has violence, it has gore, it has humor, it has swearing, and it has alcohol in it... pretty epic huh (granted, just being edgy doesn't necessarily equal good). The movie Antz which actually came out before A Bug's Life by about a month takes the role of what ants do a lot more seriously and better captures an ant like atmosphere. The movie A Bug's Life really doesn't seem to understand what ants do or how their colonies work, but the movie Antz does it all. There are the miners, the warriors, the drones (the ones with wings) the queen and others. The voice acting itself is also pretty good and Woody Allen fits the role of Z perfectly. The animation was also pretty advanced for its time, because it did many things that were hard for that time: Water, large amounts of moving objects, realistic face movement, realistic body movement, lighting, and many others.<br/><br/>The nice thing about this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be a kids movie. Ants swear in it (the word b****in is used once) and as mentioned there is a lot of violence. Like a very intense scene where the ants are trying to fight a termite colony and the ants are getting attacked by acid, are getting decapitated, and dying in other various barbaric ways. The thing is that this movie doesn't cover up death. When someone dies, the movie won't hide it.<br/><br/>The other cool thing in Antz is that the rest of the insects in the movie are as hideous and monstrous as they should be. Praying Mantis? It is infinitely larger than an Ant. Wasps? Like giants. It gives this overwhelming sense that Z is not only small in the ant world but also small in the insect world as well. There is nothing that can't kill him (even the princess could if she wanted).<br/><br/>Honestly this movie was really good, it has a good story, it has good characters, it is realistic, and has nice action. One of Dreamkworks' best."
"leandros","8","33","44","18 December 1998"," so lifelike, so didactic
","It's probably the first time Woody Allen is so much like himself when he isn't at all. Ant Z, a neurotic, fatalistic, depressive, sorry ant with a record low level of self-esteem transforms into a (part-time) content, revolutionary hero of his utterly totalitarian and fascistic colony ever imaginable. Apart from the incredibly precise animation and ""logical"" fantasy, one feels a bit distracted with the subliminal messages the picture tries to impose. While it would be easy to reduce the moral to the frequently recited motto: ""think for yourself once!"", there are too many of them to ignore. This definitely is not a kid's flick, it is meant for and appreciated by adults, with many philosophical, psychological and social references and conflicts. One big ""bravo!"" to Dreamworks. I think they have achieved the point where adults can actually enjoy animation movies while believing the whole stuff. These insects are surely going to bite some Disney bugs."
"philip_vanderveken","8","37","52","3 October 2004"," Antz isn't as perfect and smooth as a Disney film. Great!
","I'm probably a weird guy, but I really appreciate a good animated movie even though I'm no longer a kid (I'm 26 years old). What I liked about this one is the great animation, the nice story, the humor... <br/><br/>I haven't seen A Bug's Life yet, which makes it impossible for me to compare both of course, but I really liked the style used in Antz. Usually a Disney production gives me the feeling I'm watching a movie which was intended for kids only (although A Bug's Life was created by the Pixar studio's, which gives me a bit of hope), while Dreamworks understood that adults too can appreciate this kind of movies, if only they take care of the style and the story. Most of Disney's animated movies are just too smooth, too perfect for me, and to be honest the songs almost make me sick. <br/><br/>The style in Antz is much grittier. It isn't as perfect and smooth as a Disney production and the message is a lot stronger. The film is probably exciting for little children, thanks to the humor, fantastic images and action, but the underlying subtext and social commentary on humans make this movie different from Disney's moralizing films. However, the different message isn't the only difference between Disney and Dreamworks. I don't think Disney ever risked to use very well known scenes from other movies in their own films. In Antz you can find some excellent scenes which refer to movies like Metropolis, Starship Troopers,...<br/><br/>Some people have some critics on this movie because it doesn't show how a real anthill is organized, how strong ants really are, that ants don't look for a partner, ... Let me tell this to these people: I respect you're way of thinking but I think you should have watched a documentary instead of an animated movie. I sure hope you understand there is still a big difference between a documentary, based on scientific research, meant to teach people and a movie like Antz, who's only purpose is to entertain people. Personally I liked the movie for what it was and I give it an 8/10."
"BadWebDiver","10","27","37","30 August 2003"," Top class intelligent entertainment
","I loved this story. I thought is was a very intelligently entertaining movie:- a good combination of interesting ideas mixed with great visuals and broad comedy.<br/><br/>All the the voice casting was top notch; especially Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Sylvester Stallone, Dan Aykroyd, and of course Woody Allen. There was also great version of Neil Finn singing ""I Can See Clearly Now""; and the visual design and music score was breath-taking and dynamic. Plus the storyline is more gritty with a darker undercurrent, and would appeal to a more sophisticated audience, which it is good to have. I'm not saying that cute fun stories aren't OK too. In fact IMHO the wider the spectrum of stories we can get the better we'll all be.<br/><br/>I personally think this is slightly ahead of the equally brilliant A BUG'S LIFE; even though both are really top class storytelling. This one wins by about half a feeler."
"Jonah14","10","32","46","14 January 2001"," Yes, for kids.
","You know, there was a time in which we didn't candy coat stories for children. The Evil Queen in Snow White, for one, was forced to wear red-hot slippers and dance to her death. Even in older Disney films like ""Bambi"", the serious issue of death is broached.<br/><br/>Now, no one dies. It's too serious.<br/><br/>Horsehocky.<br/><br/>One of the best moments I had watching ""Antz"" in a theater was listening to a mother explain why Barbatus died. Guess what? Death is a natural part of life -- and to refute it exists is plain wrong. Or, as in the recent Disney flick ""Hercules"", Hades, the God of Death is portrayed as evil. (What, are people supposed to be immortal?)<br/><br/>While not appropriate for 4 year olds, I wouldn't think twice about showing it to an 8 year old. Why must movies be dumbed down -- PG means parental GUIDANCE. Any movie that forces you to talk to your kids after a movie is a good one. Don't treat your kids like little morons."
"gbheron","8","14","21","12 December 1999"," Animated Film That Will Entertain Adults
","From what I have read, DreamWorks got the idea of an insect animation film from Disney, rushed to market before the Disney version was released, and that they think this will enable them to compete against Disney in the animated film market?  I think some reevaluation is in order.<br/><br/>ANTZ is not bad, far from it.  The animation is very well done (to this untrained, unschooled eye) and the voices well-acted (and maybe Woody wasn't so much acting as being Woody).  The feel-good plot was well......very Disney.  Certainly worth the price of a rental.  And I mean this for adults. I can't comment of the movie being too dark and violent for small children, well maybe very small children.  <br/><br/>Nothing earth-shaking or leading edge, but good ol' entertainment."
"Cosmo-5","Null","20","32","21 December 1998"," A straightforward kid's movie? It ain'tz necessarily so...
","Okay, so it's not War and Peace, but this film is about as dark and meaningful as you could want a big-budget comedy animation to be. The computer animation itself never ceases to be awe-inspiring and more than compensates for the plot holes - I personally did like the style of the characters themselves, although others have disagreed. The casting is perfect, and Woody Allen as Z-4195 the neurotic worker ant complete with impeccable one-liners is at times hilarious. Although the plot falls into predictability, the communist metaphors combined with the basic boy-meets-girl-above-his-station story make this highly enjoyable, and all you could want as a 3D animation suitable for adults. A strong opening blow in the Disney-Dreamworks rivalry swordfight."
"smccrea-2","10","16","25","13 March 2004"," Fabulous performances by an all star cast with fabulous animation.
","Antz is a charming romantic comedy that is better appreciated by adults than children. In fact, there are some scenes that may be a bit too violent or gruesome for small children.<br/><br/>All of the actors perform brilliantly with an excellent script even though the plot is a bit trite. All the actors excel in their roles even the usually bland Stallone and Lopez who are more animated in this film than in most of their other roles.<br/><br/>I found the move to be appealing visually. Apart from some of the backgrounds that seem to be hand painted, the animation is superb."
"mjw2305","7","16","26","11 February 2006"," Dreamworks answer to 'A Bug's Life'
","Released 1 year after Disney/Pixar's 'A Bugs Life' and still during the early years of the computer generated genre, Dreamworks released their second all CGI cartoon 'ANTZ' and despite the glaring resemblances between the 2 movies; all it not as it appears.<br/><br/>ANTZ still stands alone as the more adult movie in the genre, far more complexity in the character's emotions and a far more sinister plot evolution separate this from rest. OK movies like 'Shrek', 'Finding Nemo' and 'Toy Story' have adult undertones beneath the humour, but ANTZ doesn't rely on such subtlety.<br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM OF EITHER STYLE! <br/><br/>We follow the struggle of 'Z' (Woody Allen) as he tries to come to terms with his life as a worker, his neurosis, his love for Princess Bala and dream of something better. Allen is excellently supported by an all star cast, including Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, etc, and we are treated to a visually impressive rendition of a heart warming story about life as an ANT.<br/><br/>This movie can still be enjoyed as a family film, but much of it will be lost on younger kids.<br/><br/>In Summary ANTZ is a fine film, but in truth it is difficult to compare with others in the genre, and for that; i salute it! <br/><br/>7/10"
"R_O_U_S","9","10","15","21 January 2004"," Miles better than A Bug's Life
","Miles better than A Bug's Life.  The latter film was just bugs-in-peril...a bit like The Seven Samurai, yes, but essentially unimaginative (if funny). This takes Woody Allen (""the middle child in a family of 6 billion""), makes him best mates with Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Lopez, and sticks him on the run with Sharon Stone.  At the same time, thousands of his fellows are massacred in a Starship Troopers-like attack by termites.  Only in animation.  It's exciting, it's clever, it's often hilarious, and it boasts one of the best ensemble casts ever put together."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","2","21 January 2016"," Good Fun
","Antz (1998) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Z (Woody Allen) is an ant that questions just about everything but after a chance meeting with the Princess he decides to try and meet her again, which gets the two of them outside their colony where they learn that the General (Gene Hackman) has some bad plans.<br/><br/>ANTZ isn't any sort of masterpiece but if you're a fan of Woody Allen then you'll certainly enjoy seeing his type of humor in a kids movie. In fact, the movie is a tad bit more adult in nature, which took me by surprise and especially with some of the mild cussing that can be heard in it.<br/><br/>For the most part this is a mildly amusing film that manages to get a great number of vocal talent. Not only do we get Allen and Hackman but there's also Dan Aykroyd, Sharon Stone, Danny Glover, Anne Bankroft, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez and more. All of them are good in their roles but I think the one major flaw of the film is that none of the ants really look their own. I guess part of the joke was having the worker ants and the war ants looking alike. I think this just took away from the film and it would have been better if they had their own look. Heck, even the Allen character doesn't have any of the actor's features."

","Antz is rock-solid entertainment, and while it isn't as funny as Bug's Life, it has a great social message that Bug's Life lacks. I thoroughly recommend this movie, and the only criticism I have is that there are some scenes that young children might find frightening, like the fight between the ants and the big green bugs. The visuals are a delight, as well as the tightly-structured script.The story, while simple, is well-told, and is sensibly revolved around the life of Z, brilliantly voiced by Woody Allen. Sharon Stone was suitably feisty as Princess Bala, and Sylvester Stallone was a huge surprise as Weaver. Christopher Walken was also good, but it's the villain who steals the show, like Bug's Life. Gene Hackman's General was deliciously sinister, and quite complex, very similar to Kevin Spacey in Bug's Life(Hopper is SLIGHTLY better). All in all, a witty and charming film, that is recommended. 9/10. Bethany Cox"
"Lady_Targaryen","10","7","13","12 November 2005"," Every ant has his day.
","This is one of the greatest animations of all times; And together with the great animation,are the actors who are behind the voices: Woody Allen is perfect as the voice of Z, a neurotic and complicated ant,that is not happy as a worker in his colony. Jennifer Lopez(Azteca),Sylvester Stallone(Weaver) Christopher Walken (Colonel Cutter)and Sharon Stone(Princess Bala) are great as well, and I cannot imagine another cast.<br/><br/>Antz probably will be more completely understood by adults than kids;the reason why I say that, is because this animation is clearly a critic for a totalitarian societies where the individual does not count,and people can't think for themselves. When Azteca says to Z 'you think too much' or 'you should accept the place you are' and things like that,you can have an idea of what the ants society is based of. As a lesson of this movie, we can say that is always important to think for ourselves and not follow all the orders people gave to us."

","It is a cartoon meaning two things: First it shows us a typical cartoon. A cartoon of children..Main character Faces with some fun and this make audience have some fun. However, the cartoon has another face. As can be seen in the book of George Orwell called 1984, there can be a guy distinguished, alienated himself from the society even though the society was established with very strong ties. It is interesting that, there can be another member like himself and they find each other by ignoring some strict rules. As we saw it in 1984, same thing occurs in this cartoon. Being bored of her life, Princess Bala joins to workers entertainment. And the `extreme` life of the couples gets start. As the time passes, strict rules become useless and some liberal ideas spread through the society. Moreover, we see some lovers from different classes. These are some examples of the destruction of a totalitarian society in the cartoon. And we see many fascist rulers like General who wants to create a pure colony in our world. This cartoon is a very good example of this idea. As in the real world this idea collapses at the end. Finally i can add that there is a lot to learn how to make all the members enough satisfied.

"drifteru","5","6","12","26 November 1998"," Who thought animating films for adults was a good idea?
","_Antz_ is the latest in a misbegotten trend of trying to graft adult content onto animated family films.  Blame _The Lion King_ (and guiding hand for both films, Jeffrey Katzenberg) for doing it well and reaping the financial rewards, but successors reaching for the same brass ring (both within Disney -- _Hunchback_, e.g. -- and without) go too far.  Not only is the language in _Antz_ a tad inappropriate (do you really want to explain ""erotic fantasy"" to your five-year-old?), the use of Woody Allen as the voice of the hero along with battle and flood imagery reminiscent of other DreamWorks films like _Saving Private Ryan_ and _Deep Impact_ only reinforces the sense that _Antz_ is aspiring to be something perverse:  a gritty, neurotic, philosophical disaster movie for the whole family.<br/><br/>But the worst offense of all is that the film is boring.  The script is as trite as they come, moving as it does from one movie cliche to the next without stopping for real character development.  The dialogue is surprisingly witless and plodding, with every joke telegraphed well in advance.  The songs -- admittedly a frequent bane of Disney films as well -- are of even less interest here as they are ""standards"" tossed in for no apparent reason.  And the film is visually dull as well -- all dark and dingy in the ant colony where most of the action takes place, but hardly more beautiful in the great outdoors.<br/><br/>_Antz_ may represent another leap forward in the art of computer animation, but I found the short trailer I saw for _A Bug's Life_ to contain much more life, color, whimsy and invention than the entirety of this disappointing affair."
"zardoz-13","8","4","7","14 June 2008"," Even Adults Will Be Animated by ""Antz!""
","""Antz"" is the first computer animated feature from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Studio. Apparently, Spielberg and his studio partner Jeffrey Katzenberg wanted to beat their competitionWalt Disney and its ""Bug""by releasing ""Antz"" five months ahead of its original release date. Despite its predictable, anthropomorphic, B-movie plot, populated with obvious stereotypes, and indebted to several sci-fi films, ""Antz"" manages to enchant. Pacific Data Images' impressive 3-D animation; the witty, grown-up dialogue; the messages about conformity vs. individualism; and on-target voicing by a constellation of stars all make ""Antz"" an exhilarating experience. Not only does ""Antz"" emerge as an ingenious cartoon, but adults also can enjoy it without feeling insulted by its puny heroics. While the stimulating CGI special effects will flabbergast kiddies, the film's adult-oriented themes may boggle their wee minds. Happily, too, ""Antz"" dispenses with any Top-40 wannabe hits sung by the cast.<br/><br/>Indeed, the Todd Alcott and Chris & Paul Weitz screenplay covers familiar Disney ground. Work ant Z-4195 (Woody Allen, the cinematic master of the meshuganah comedy) complains about the conformist society where he toils long hours alongside millions of other proletarian ants in the excavation of a mega tunnel. Signs emblazoned with slogans such as 'Free time is for training,"" ""Let's Work,"" and ""We, Not You"" proliferate in a setting that resembles Fritz Lang's 1926 silent, sci-fi, German, masterpiece ""Metropolis."" Like typical Woody Allen heroes, such as Broadway Danny Rose and Alvy Singer, Z qualifies as an angst-addled neurotic who babbles with a nasal twang and spouts consistently cute one-liners. Perennial feelings of insignificance bug Z. He sums up his plight as a 'soil relocation engineer' to his ant therapist (Paul Mazurky's voice) in the film's first scene.<br/><br/>""I always feel uncomfortable around crowds. I have this fear of enclosed spaces. When you're the middle child in a family of five million, you don't get any attention. My father was basically a drone. I feel physically inadequate. My whole life, I've never been able to lift more than ten times my body weight,"" Z explains. Incredibly, Woody Allen didn't write ""Antz."" Co-directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson let him tailor the dialogue to fit his native vocal patterns. Insiders say the cast recorded their voices during individually taped sessions, and that the animators incorporated signature physical gestures into their animation. Nope, Z doesn't resemble Allen. In fact, Z favors a classic Spielberg character who loved to hitch a ride in the basket of a bicycle during a full moon.<br/><br/>Anyway, Z is a lowly worker ant with nothing except his paranoia to distinguish him. Z's friendly, female co-worker, Azteca (Jennifer Lopez of ""Enough""), tries to discourage Z from thinking such nonconformist nonsense. Z, however, refuses to accept his place as just another meaningless cog in a big machine. ""I'm supposed to do everything for the colony?"" Z gripes. ""And what about my needs?"" In the middle of the plot, the writers introduce the concept of an insect nirvana called Insectopia. In Insectopia, you can get anything that you want and you don't have to work for it! While Weaver and an ant are in the bar, they hear about an ant that has been to the fabled Insectopia. The truth that Z discovers about Insectopia adds to the mirth of ""Antz."" This entire conversation sounds like something that was edited out of the Humphrey Bogart classic ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre."" <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the subversive General Mandible (dubbed by a villainous Gene Hackman) has convinced the gullible queen ant (Anne Bancroft) that their sworn enemies, acid-spewing termites, pose a threat. Not only does the colony's future depend on the new mega tunnel, but the ants also can only ensure their survival with a preemptive strike against the termites. Can we say ""Starship Troopers?"" Actually, Mandible wants to wipe out his colony so that he can wed the queen ants' lovely daughter, Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), and the build his own ant empire.<br/><br/>At least, ""Antz"" has a villain that thinks big! Those termites are pretty scary, too. They resemble a souped-up version of the boss critter of the spiders in ""Starship Troopers"" The ugly fiends have hoses sticking out of their foreheads that spray acid. The clever staging of the assault on a decaying tree stump, the Termite HQ, and how Z manages to survive the suicidual battle is well-done. Adult critics that try to shield young children from reality may have a hard time dealing with the Danny Glover character whose decapitated head talks. Z finds Barbatus (Danny Glover of ""Lethal Weapon"") on a battlefield littered with hundreds of dead ants and termites. ""Don't follow orders all your life,"" screams the disembodied head to Z before it dies.<br/><br/>Anyhow, Bala balks at wedlock to the megalomaniacal Mandible. Slumming incognito in a nightspot, she spots Z standing alone at the bar and picks him up. They upset an army of ants sash-shaying on the dance floor to the strains of ""Guantanamera."" Bala and Z improvise their own jitterbug a la ""Pulp Fiction."" Chaos erupts into an old-fashioned bar room brawl out of a John Wayne western. Bala flees, but Z resolves to see her again. Switching places with muscle-headed, nice guy soldier ant pal, Weaver (splendidly voiced by Sylvester Stallone), Z gets to parade past the princess. When he learns that Weaver's company is shipping out on a suicide mission to destroy the Termites, Z's plans go awry. Meanwhile, Weaver has the time of his life in the tunnel romancing Azteca. Miraculously, Z survives Mandible's massacre. Surprising the evil general, Z returns to a warrior's welcome. Things go suddenly wrong for Z, and he tries to escape from Mandible. Inadvertently, Z kidnaps Bala, and they flee for Insectopia. Insectopia turns out to be a picnic area in Central Park, New York City. Eventually, Z exposes Mandible, wins the princess' hand in marriage after nearly getting squashed by a giant, bubble-gum encrusted sneaker!<br/><br/>""Antz"" is a funny, fast-moving hill of hilarity."

","Yes, the technology was mighty-mighty, the allusions came thick and fast... but I only laughed once and I don't even remember which joke that was at. I understood their jokes - I just didn't think they were funny. Plot too predictable and characters too formula. That's all I have to say."
"WED-2","1","12","30","23 July 1999"," A highly anticipated...flop
","I had entered the theater with an open mind upon the opening of DreamWorks' initial animated feature, ""Antz"".  Finally, I felt that there would be a perfect film for children.  However, before the film was over, I was in a state of wonder how a film for children could be so inappropriate.  Now, before you get ""antzy"" (sorry!), I'd like to note the entire toy collection of ""Antz"" figurines, clothing, action figures, and the like aimed at children under 7.  In addition, the commercials for the film (which showed a festive dance and bright picnic scenery) were continually aired during young children's programs such as cartoons on FOX, NBC, ABC, etc. where only an imbecile wouldn't know that kids were watching.  So naturally, any concerned parent would be skeptical over an MPAA rating of PG when the merchandise was aimed at a G audience.<br/><br/>The violence is quite appalling and the language pushes the PG rating.  I don't disapprove of animated movies for adults (think Japanese anime), but when films can literally claim bloody murder and receive a PG rating, I find it completely and absolutely horrifying.  When will film studios learn that a completely entertaining film can be created without profanity?  Within every scene, the absolutely vulgar and horrific cast screams out a four letter word.  Other family movies with PG ratings can produce quality work without uttering such pointless drivel such as ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Hook"", and ""Matilda"".  Compared to these traditional family films, ""Antz"" hardly measures up.  And this barely touches upon the movie's punctured plot.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that such a promising company as DreamWorks would stoop so low to collect the final dollar.  It's the parents which fork out the money for the film, most of which ADORE the violence and vulgarity...the perfect target.  Where DreamWorks may have produced quality family fare, they spit out another traditional movie flop without the heart and warmth needed to be entertaining for the ENTIRE family."
"B1rd","3","10","24","11 October 2007"," What the ....?
","What was this movie trying to be? It has a serious social/political subtext, but its too simplistic and naive of a message to support the whole movie as entertainment for adults. It's got action and goofiness for the kids, but it's a bit scary and dark for young ones. While the double-entendres will go over their heads, there are adult usages of words you won't want your grade schooler repeating. The animation is generally impressive but the characters' faces range from human-like (Weaver/Sly Stallone) to weird and alien-looking (Z/Woody Allen) with a limited range of emotion. The big name casting doesn't work at all. Woody Allen does the same shtick he's been doing for almost 40 years and it's just bizarre to hear him in an animated feature with a plot like this. (At least in his old TV cartoon his character looked like him, but that really didn't work well either.) Sharon Stone is wooden and old-sounding as the young princess. The other characters are shallow clichés of their particular voice-actor's typical movie role (except for Walken, who does a great job of not being one of his usual nutjobs). I guess it was all a novelty at the time. As mentioned in other comments, the story line is a mish-mosh of old plots from much better movies or books. The music is high quality but odd in places. The only humor in the movie is Woody's, so if you don't find his routine especially funny, this will be agony to sit through. Whatever the movie was trying to be, it doesn't work now. It does occur to me, though, that maybe its entertainment value is as a study on early mistakes made during the rebirth of full length animated films aimed at general audiences. Thank goodness Hollywood finally figured it out."

","I had little to no expectations for this film, and man will I say that I was absolutely delighted. Antz is a very amusing satire that holds well both as a animated adventure and a Woody Allen flick. The film is endlessly hilarious, with tons of funny dialogue, quotable lines, and truly heartfelt moments. It's almost ironic that a film with such small creatures can be so massively entertaining, but Antz is incredibly easy to watch, and one that keeps you at the edge of your seat waiting to find what is next. It's been over 20 years since the films release, but it's still a relevant satire for today, and an animated style and honesty that I wish were still portrayed in more animated films today. The film can be crass when it wants to, with plenty of swears and some adult humor that would not be in the film were it to be released today, but is part of what it makes it so grand. Antz is a surprisingly honest, refreshing animated comedy that is truly unique, even with its comparisons to bugs life. It's humor may not always land, but it does so more than not, and when it does it truly brings its all- without ever seeming like too much. It's a touching tale, that is equally romantic as it is inspiring and heartfelt, and may just earn a place as one of my favorite animated comedies ever.

"paul-nemecek","7","1","1","3 July 2018"," Debugging Antz
","Part of the fun of the movie Antz is that on works on many different levels and as several different stories. Children might enjoy it as simply a cute animated film (although the aftermath of the battle between the ants vs. the termites earned Antz a PG rating). At another level, Antz is the old girl-meet-boy from the wrong side of the tracks story). The film is also part adventure film with political intrigue and action. At yet another level, the film is an interesting political parable complete with sophisticated humor and witty dialogue.<br/><br/>Antz is about Ant Z, a neurotic worker ant in a colony of millions of ants. The movie opens with Ant Z lying on the psychiatrist's couch asking questions about the meaning of life, and the needs of the individual as opposed to the society as a whole. Fittingly, the voice, neuroses, and mannerisms of Ant Z are provided by Woody Allen. Sharon Stone provides the voice of Princess Bala, daughter of the queen of the ants. Princess Bala meets Z when she goes to a working-class bar. There is a cute dance sequence here complete with imitations of John Travolta and Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction.
 
The one part of the movie that could use some debugging is the political parable. There are some references to the class system that could have been written by Karl Marx. There are other times when Ant Z rallies the troops around the themes of individualism and autonomy. In short, the film is a bit unfocused in terms of its central theme, and as a result, the political parable is the least satisfying of the elements.<br/><br/>If we don't take this part too seriously, we can still enjoy the film. Additional voices are provided by Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Danny Glover, and Jennifer Lopez (too name a few). The computer-generated animation is excellent. The dialogue is witty and well-written with lots of tongue-in-cheek references to contemporary culture. For example, when Ant Z is in trouble, a chorus of Ants starts singing ""all we are saying, is give Z a chance."" All in all, not a bad summary evaluation for the film as a whole."
"pyrocitor","8","1","1","21 April 2016"," The 'Ant' is for 'Anti-authoritarian,' but the 'Z' is for 'Zippy'
","History will regard it as the film that famously butted mandibles with Disney's A Bug's Life for monopoly over the anthropomorphized bug market in 1998. And yes, Antz is fundamentally a product of its time - if not for its hip, 90s misspelling, then for the reason that no one would ever let Woody Allen within a hundred miles of a kids film again. Still, he's able to meld his neurotic, intellectual schlub persona well into this clever little tale. Antz may not be as heartwarming or beautiful as many of the decade's classics, but, appropriate for a film championing the snarky underdog, it's still easily fun and provocative enough to entertain and stand out, even against its insectoid competition. <br/><br/>Fittingly for a film sparring with Disney, Antz sneaks in subversive themes of individualism and Marxist anti-authoritarian revolt into a children's animation. But this script is far too snappy to ever get bogged down in misguided dogmatism, pumping out sly gag after gag to keep parents and kids alike engaged (if ""the war on termites"" isn't enough to win you over, try Dan Aykroyd's wasp's drolly pontificating on ""Eurotrash""). Directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson churn out a hugely fun adventure romp, which bustles along at a perfectly bouncy pace, pulling thunderous momentum from Harry Gregson-Williams' tremendous score. The deceptively detailed animation still holds up (check out how much Colonel Cutter's gaunt facial curvature looks like Christopher Walken), especially when playing with size perspective in the world above ground, turning a ride on the underside of a human's shoe into the most blood- curdling roller-coaster imaginable.<br/><br/>Still, if the high percentage of Woody Allen jokes wasn't already enough to tip the scales in favour of a slightly older audience (""I have something against drinking from the anus of another creature""), the intense content is sure to set off all but the hardiest young viewers. Not only do we watch Sylvester Stallone's cocky worker ant get beaten in an interrogation sequence - there's also the nightmarish termite massacre will. A flurry of stabbing and decapitation against the acid-spewing, behemoth enemies, it's a magnificent sci-fi battle for adults, but easily one of the most horrifying sequences ever to make its way into a kids movie.<br/><br/>Antz also marks one of the first animated features to play off celebrity voice casting, which unquestionably works in its favour. Apart from quality comedic work from Allen and Stallone playing off their established personas with gleeful aplomb, having a supporting cast chock full of actors like Jennifer Lopez, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Dan Aykroyd and Christopher Walken helps lend texture to otherwise largely thankless secondary roles. Gene Hackman's ferocious growl makes for a perfect adversary as disturbingly militaristic Mandible, and Sharon Stone's effete drawl butts heads perfectly with Allen's neurotic bluster, keeping their road trip pseudo-romance entertaining throughout. <br/><br/>Even if only regarded as A Bug's Life's sparky, snarky cousin, Antz is uniquely daring enough children's fare to stand the test of time. The humour still bristles, the adventure whips along, and there are enough sentimental grace notes amongst the film's self-assured, intellectual snark to ensure that adults and (slightly older) kids are enjoyably engaged throughout. And hey - how long have you been yearning for your average flick to contain the phrase ""Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor?"" Yeah, I thought so.<br/><br/>-8/10"

","Antz (1998): Dir: Eric Darnell, Tim Johnson / Voices: Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken: Entertaining computer generated film about an ant with high hopes. The ""z"" in the title regards individuality as a worker ant convinces a soldier ant to switch places so that he may experience adventure in the outside world but he is thrown into the midst of a termite war. Z emerges from hiding and is celebrated as a hero until his worker title is revealed. To avoid punishment he flees with the reluctant Princess. While typical, co-directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson highlight with excellent detail particularly during a picnic sequence where the Princess is concealed in bubblegum on the bottom of a shoe that clothes in upon Z. Z is voiced by Woody Allen complete with posturing and personality. Sharon Stone voices the Princess who is at first seen as a hostage until she realizes what Z is. Sylvester Stallone voices the good-hearted soldier ant who switched places with Z. Gene Hackman voices the villain and despite his talent the role is standard issue and too familiar. Christopher Walken appropriately voices a sniper ant doing the obvious. We know how this will end but it is the celebrity personalities that prevail.

","I watched this for the first time with my sister as part of our Dreamworks Movie Marathon. Though not even remotely comparable to Pixar's A Bug's Life in terms of quality, Antz is an enjoyable overall experience. The main character was a bit annoying, but at least he was different than I expected. His romantic counterpart was very intolerable, and this resulted in an extremely forced romance between two characters who had no reason to fall in love. <br/><br/>That all being said, the movie had teeth, and it was unafraid to kill off characters left and right. The main theme of non-conformity really beat you over the head throughout the film, and could have been a bit more subtle. This basic plot leads me to believe this film is directed at kids, but the innuendo and adult-jokes make me think otherwise. Not sure if it's a good kids movie since I'm not a kid anymore, but Antz is a pretty good film with some problems here and there. <br/><br/>I'll be reviewing every Dreamworks film after my sister and I watch it, so Antz is a good start."

"StevePulaski","8","1","1","15 February 2013"," A communist fable? That's not so far in left field...
","Antz is a notable film for three distinct reasons. One, it ushered in a whole new kind of animated film for children; dark, stylish, very adult, and usually appreciated by a certain type of child. This isn't necessarily the story believe would possess mainstream appeal by a public treated to the wonders of Toy Story and a previous slew of Disney films. Two, it bears a darker and more stark animation style that breaks free from the cuteness of other animated tales. And three, the explicit controversy that lead to this film's creation.<br/><br/>For the ""Cliff Notes"" version of the story, Jeffrey Katzenberg, an executive at Disney, departed the day Pixar/Disney head John Lasseter pitched the idea for A Bug's Life, a charming little computer animated feature centering around the rodents of your backyard. Not long after Katzenberg departed, he formed ""Dreamworks"" and his debut feature would be Antz, focusing, likewise, on an insect-drive society, released seven weeks before A Bug's Life. Lasseter was greatly disheartened by Katzenberg's move, which was easily the case of taking someone's great idea and using it against them. Which one became more well-known? At the time, I'd most likely say A Bug's Life, but both films have gone on to be sort of the forgotten creatures of two massive companies. Yet Antz is more than meets the eye in several regards.<br/><br/>We focus on an ant colony in New York City where ant Z-4195 (voiced by Woody Allen - whose character is also nicknamed ""Z"") is gridlocked in an oppressively totalitarian society where individualism is discouraged and conformity is king. As neurotic and somewhat inept he is, he hungers for the opportunity to express himself in a land dominated by conformists obeying the order of the ruling class. ""Z"" befriends Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), the daughter of the ruling queen ant, who takes a liking to his quirkiness, but recognizes he is merely a worker ant and not a noble soldier ant. To impress her, ""Z"" sneaks into the soldier march and is quickly taken for a ride to defend his ant colony. Yet he overlooks the fact that General Mandible (Gene Hackman) is purposely shipping out the loyal troops to die so he can formulate his own society filled with goon-like ants that talk with incredible power. The whole thing escalates into an integration of not only the plot of rebellion and survival, but romance and possessing a non-conformist attitude.<br/><br/>The voice acting will without a doubt turn off some people, but there are so many terrifically cast people in this film that sink into their roles fittingly. Woody Allen comfortably sinks into his role as a neurotic worker, Gene Hackman is brilliantly cast as the villain, Sharon Stone works as the princess, and Sylvester Stallone and Danny Glover exercise their roles to a pleasant extent.<br/><br/>Visually, as stated before, this is one of the darkest animated films I've seen - one of the very few not to be dominated by eye-popping, candy-coated colors while being soaked in a nice innocence that's easy to swallow. The message is strong and versatile; don't settle for conformity, but branch out and do what you want to do. Go against convention, do noble acts, do something that doesn't put you in a line occupied by faceless others. Some people have said Antz is a communist fable and I whole-heatedly agree. It shows in detail a society of shameless totalitarianism and exploits how it robs people (or ants in this case) of their individualistic qualities and personal traits.<br/><br/>Antz is primarily targeted towards the ten and up demographic, but I can see slightly younger kids appreciating this for its charming convention-breaking roots and its enigmatic presence it unleashes on its viewers. Dreamworks would later become known for implementing this kind of style, where it would ditch the younger crowd demographic in favor of the tweens and teens still cool enough to see animated films. Needless to say, with their immense success with the Shrek and Madagascar franchises, they've had quite the lucrative success. At the very least, this is a footnote in the world of animation, not just for its successful cast but for its darker themes and appearance that contrast it from the typical animated film.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft, and Dan Aykroyd. Directed by: Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson."

It's not just a movie for kids it's also for teens and adults.

Through his perseverance and love for the colony, he ends up exceeding even his own expectations.

","Toy Story opened up a whole new market for animation. It was a quantum leap forward and showed us the infinite possibilities of computer animation. After it put Pixar on the map, other studios were quick to jump on the bandwagon, with DreamWorks emerging as the first to go where only Pixar had gone before.<br/><br/>Pixar and DreamWorks are arguably the premier studios in this field. All the others vie for the same type of acceptance but have never wrested the crown from them. But when it comes to computer animation, Pixar have the edge over DreamWorks by a very wide margin. They manage an effortless blend of involving stories, characters we care deeply for, beautiful animation, and a rich vein of humour for adults as well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I'm not quite as excited when DreamWorks animated features hits cinemas. A lot of them wind up infected with a modern cynicism, as well as an annoying habit of filling them out with film references and product placement. But they're animated debut Antz is definitely one of they're best, and one I have no problem watching time and time again.<br/><br/>Its interesting that Antz was released the very same year as Pixar's A Bug's Life. There are uncanny similarities. They're both about a misfit worker ant at odds with the society they live in. A relationship between the hero of the film and an ant princess. And even a similar climax where the colony must learn to combine as a whole to save it from destruction.<br/><br/>Of the two films, Antz is better. It does much more with the conceit of an idealist out of step with the rest of his colony. Also, where the hero of A Bug's Life was rather too anonymous, Antz has a fabulous protagonist, Z.<br/><br/>Z has always felt like an outsider. He was the middle-child in a family of five million. He derives no satisfaction from his job. And he has a problem with following the unblinking, unquestioning work ethic of the ant colony. This is all revealed to us in the opening scene where Z is in therapy, running off a list of inadequacies to a counsellor.<br/><br/>The voice of Z comes from none other than Woody Allen. How DreamWorks ever managed to land him I'll never know, but it was a stroke of genius. This opening monologue is classic Allen and could easily set the stage for Manhattan or Annie Hall.<br/><br/>Z comes in the unmistakable ""world is against me"" neurotic vibe Allen's perfected over the past four decades. I've never liked Woody Allen the actor as much as I like Woody Allen the director, but he's perfectly at home here. He's not really stretching himself, nor is it any different from what he usually does in any of his own films, but he's the perfect choice for Z.<br/><br/>In fact Antz has a very interesting lineup - Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft, even Sylvester Stallone. Its even more interesting to discover how good they all are at voicework. You wonder why they've never attempted it before now.<br/><br/>Antz is a film that could never be made in the traditional hand drawn animation style. Not without compromising it. Toy Story could be done like that, because there was nothing in it that couldn't be accomplished the old fashioned way. But the computer animated medium allows Antz greater freedom. We see sweeping vistas of hundreds upon hundreds of ants, all performing individual tasks as far as the eye can see. You can imagine a hand drawn animator going blind trying to achieve the same thing.<br/><br/>One thing I especially liked about the film is the way it credibly depicts an ant colony. The animators have made an effort not to make them seem too warm and cuddly. They come in all the right colours, and the world they live in is a gritty and dirty one. Whereas A Bug's Life went the other way and bent over backwards to make them much more accessible to the kids in the audience.<br/><br/>Antz is not afraid to do things that might be considered shocking to an audience. The most striking setpiece in the film is when the ants go to war against they're mortal enemies, the termites. And its a nightmarish sequence. It comes out like a collision between the Battle of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan and the souped-up bug hunt of Starship Troopers. This type of carnage is something that never assailed the safer horizons of A Bug's Life.<br/><br/>Not only that, and unlike most kiddie films today, Antz will kill its characters, even the likable ones, with no chance of a return from the dead cliché. When the ants are nearly wiped out en masse at the climax, there is never any question in your mind that they're lives are in danger. You really wind up feeling for they're plight. There's also a level of casual swearing that quite surprised one. The film's PG certificate is well deserved.<br/><br/>One of the unpalatable things about animated fare nowadays, and DreamWorks is a particularly guilty offender is the way they play to a modern audience. Because Antz is they're first animated film, its not as overtook by product plugging and film referencing like DreamWorks' subsequent films. All you have to do is hold it up to Shark Tale and Shrek 2 to see what I mean. The scenes at Insectopia have a few intrusive brand names but never enough that they have the run of the film.<br/><br/>It all gets itself together for a thrilling climax, even if General Mandible doesn't get the end a villain of his stature deserves. But Antz is a real charmer with a smashing soundtrack. Antz fired the starters pistol between DreamWorks and Pixar, and while Pixar are normally a sure bet, this is the one time where DreamWorks outstripped Pixar in every possible way."

","Dreamworks Animation, who we all know for their commercially successful films, started out with this hilarious film called Antz.<br/><br/>Antz leading character is a working ant called Z, voiced by Woody Allen. Allen does excellent work at making Z a very optimistic and self-conscious character, a lot like the many characters he was written and directed himself as over years. Like Allen, Z is very optimistic about how he feels about his life.<br/><br/>The film starts with Z talking to a psychologist about how feels that he is just worthless. The film then transitions to Z feeling like he is worthless, but with attitude. We then meet Azteca, voiced by Jennifer Lopez. She is friends with Z but nothing like him. She feels like he needs to relax.<br/><br/>At the same time, we are introduced to two other key characters: General Mandible, voiced by Gene Hackman, and Princess Bala, voiced by Sharon Stone. Hackman is just pure excellence in making Mandible to be the sadistic general who wants to see his worker ants wiped out. Bala is a lot like Z in the sense that she is not happy with her life either.<br/><br/>Later, Z and Bala by chance meet up at a bar and dance together. When Bala leaves, she thinks that they will never see him again. Z asks for a favor from his friend Weaver, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. Z wants to switch places with Weaver, who is a soldier ant. After Z helps win a war against termites, he finds out about Mandible's mission to wipe out the workers. Z makes it his mission to have his colony break out of its totalitarian ways led by Mandible's tyrant power and to win over Bala's heart.<br/><br/>Another great voice performance is Colonel Cutter, voiced by Christopher Walken. Walken is great at being the guy who has to tolerate Mandible for so long until being fed up.<br/><br/>The animation is great at showing what life can be like for an individual ant in his culture.

Bala (Sharon Stone) is a rebellious princess who yearns for the spit and grit of the life of Joe Everyant.

In a desperate attempt to see his prospective lady-love, Z switches jobs with his muscular soldier ant friend, Weaver (Sylvester Stallone). Hilarity ensues, as Z's desperate attempts to romance the proud princess help him unearth the diabolical schemes being concocted by the bloodthirsty General Mandible (Gene Hackman). In the colony's darkest hour, Z might just turn out to be the hero they need.<br/><br/>This film is great and fun for all ages.

","Antz looked like quite an interesting premise, I was absolutely intrigued to see it. Unfortunately, I was bored stiff during this imaginative but near-unwatchable film.<br/><br/>The action hones straight in on Z-4195 (Woody Allen), a worker ant living a blue-collar existence among a colony of millions, who is none too happy with his lot in life. Possible escape comes in the form of the lovely Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), with whom he becomes smitten after an impromptu dance at a bar, only for a string of mishaps to occur in his attempts to impress her: ""Z"" becomes a war hero, a revolutionary, and finally kidnaps Bala, stranding the pair in the outside world. Meanwhile, it becomes increasingly clear that Bala's fianc, General Mandible (Gene Hackman), is one untrustworthy ant.<br/><br/>The story is original, but the idea of computer-generated war ants is used poorly. The actors are a major upside to Antz, Sylvester Stallone who plays `Z's war buddy is excellent for a change, and Woody Allen is amusingly choice as `Z.' The characters are plenty likeable and the direction is great, but Antz drags on for many large drinks of coke, and the story soon begins to lose track of where its going.<br/><br/>Antz isn't all that terrible, I guess it isn't my type of film.

","Once again showing that animated films often have better plots, more humour and far greater emotional pull Antz delivers very well. Brilliantly cast throughout Woody Allen especially shines as (What else) a neurotic, physically and aggressively diminutive misfit whose non-conformist attitude sets him against the engrained Ant culture of self-sacrifice and collectivity over the individual. Although the Marxist undertones are obvious they are well put and not too in-your-face. They also show animators desire to open up this market to adults as well as children. Funny, scary and absorbing this film pushes all the right buttons as it's perfectly timed 80 minutes elapse. One to watch, even without the kids."

","Antz, on it's own, would have been a good movie, if you enjoy Woody Allen's neurotic characters and self-depreciating one-liners.  When held up to the same standard as ""A Bug's Life"", however, it's looks like a cheap immitation.  I don't know how these movies spontaneously pop up -- like one year we get a pair of asteroid movies, the next, a pair of animated ant movies -- but ""Antz"" is worth seeing once.

","Who'd have expected an animated feature about ants that opens with a Woody Allen monologue expressing his ant angst? While kids will love the effects and there may be enough action to keep them awake, this is classic Woody down to his ant character's hand-wringing gestures. Adults will also be happy with the in-jokes supplied by Sylvester Stallone as a friendly Rambo ant, Dan Ackroyd and Jane Curtin as WASPs, and Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken playing their classic villain roles. The plot is a small step above the typical good guy vs. bad guy routine with social commentary that you can actually talk about with your kids afterwards.

Sadly, the fun and charm of an otherwise good movie would not be affected by replacing these words with less offensive phrases. I have heard that they included these words to get a PG rating and hopefully draw more adult attention. The real money is made by a kids' movie in repeat viewings, tape rental/sales, and merchandising (toys). I am going to make sure that my kids never see this movie again in a theater, we will NOT buy the tape, and my kids will never own ANY Antz merchandise. Dreamworks gambled for more $$$ by including inappropriate language, but I think they will lose in the long term. Pay attention, Disney!

","Antz, while appearing to be a cartoon, really is a movie geared towards adults rather than children.  Strangely enough, it is a story more out of the genre of Orwell or ""Brave New World"" than the Saturday morning cartoons for children.  This is Woody Allen vs. The System.  The laughs I heard from the audience were from adults; children were silent or asking explanations from nearby adults."

""A Bug's Life"" vs. ""Antz"", this is one of the ones I feel only a tie is fair. ""Antz"" is an amazing animated film for one reason above all: awesome voice cast. Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Danny Glover and Woody Allen, there's almost too much talent to bear. Also, there's so much subtle humor to appreciate. I originally saw the film ten years ago and laughed and now being an adult there's so much I missed. Only now do I get the adult-oriented jokes, truly making the movie timeless. And the film has a pretty good theme to it; the importance of individuality as opposed to the hordes of conformity.<br/><br/>""Antz"" is great."

An amazing film as far as Anmation goes, and is recommendable for everyone.  I might fear (though I honestly don't beleve) the action sequences between ants and termites are too violent, while adults who love Fellini and Allen films won't appreciate Allen in a film like this. But I don't care, because Allen adds a lot of good humor into the mix of mind-blowing animation and fun.  So watch it, and hopefully enjoy. A"

","I was impressed with all the big names that were in this film and figured that it just HAD to be at least marginally entertaining.  And I was right--it was sometimes marginally entertaining.  I just couldn't help thinking that this could have been a much better film by doing one of two things: making this completely a childrens' movie, or making it a ""grownup"" movie.  As it is, Antz wobbles back and forth and just doesn't do either job very well.<br/><br/>The animation just wasn't consistently good.  Sometimes the screen was filled with beautiful eye candy, and other times it was just a plain screen with an unmoving, undetailed head of an ant that looked like something from an old video game on my old computer.<br/><br/>The supposedly deep underlying social messages just didn't work for me.  I wasn't inspired by the emotional music and all the references to other movies just seemed to fall flat.  The film's big adventures didn't seem all that adventuresome or exciting.<br/><br/>If they wanted to make a dark comedy for adults, they marketed the film wrong, and definitely didn't put in very much dark comedy (although the potential was definitely there).  If they wanted to make a kids' movie that adults would enjoy, they somehow missed that mark as well...  Next time out I hope Dreamworks has a more coherent plan before they start ""filming""."

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","0","3 November 2016"," Too Smart for its Own Good...
","Great films often have one thing in common; the first minutes make you certain that you're going to encounter awesomeness many times. <br/><br/>And surprisingly, in the case of ""Antz"", I had that impression before the very first minute ended (not counting the opening credits). I should mention that Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors and storytellers, because when the opening shot showed a shadowy silhouette of what looked like a pre-2001 New York City and when I heard the voice of Woody Allen in voice-over, deep inside, I knew it was going to be a very special experience. And I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>So the shadows unveil tall grass looking down on an anthill where we can hear Z' whining to (guess what) his psychiatrist. His mother abandoned him, he never knew his father and he feels somewhat insignificant. Yes, we've heard that before, but the masterstroke is to have adapted Woody Allen's usual shtick for the ants' world. The anthill is designed to look like a vast and complex metropolis where one can easily develop deep feeling of rejections if he has a mother whose daily occupation consists on laying eggs. When the number of children is to be counted on millions, this is not your usual middle-child syndrome and Z elevates the Allenian existential crisis to its most hilarious heights.<br/><br/>And I admire Dreamworks for picking the most unlikely protagonist for not for any animated film, but their first one, their ""Toy Story"". And for its first hit, DreamWorks recreated a very convincing Orwellian society, a world where ants are conditioned from the start, checked at their birth and selected to be either soldiers or workers. Z is a worker, he doesn't like his job much, there's more exciting work than digging holes and demolishing rocks, but as a natural-born pacifist, he doesn't want to be a soldier either. In fact, Z only wishes he could have a choice, to be able to take his own decisions. If children wouldn't necessarily care for Woody Allen, Z's personal issues are handled in a way that can even appeal to a younger audience. If anything, ""Antz"" is like a kids' introduction to Woody Allen.<br/><br/>But let's not make it too centered on our lovable neurotic loser. As central as Z is, we also get to know his friends, a gentle solidly-built soldier voiced by Sylvester Stallone, a co-worker voiced by Jennifer Lopez, and at the top of the hierarchy, you have Princess Bala, voiced by Sharon Stone, her mother, the Queen, voiced by Anne Bancroft. Bala sounds like the typical Princess with a craving for freedom and self-accomplishment but actually, she's just curious to discover the outside world. She has no projects to cancel her marriage with General Mandible, the ambiguous Army Chief voiced by Gene Hackman, and whose right-hand man has the voice of Christopher Walken. You get it, this is a star-studded cast.<br/><br/>But the voices are never distracting because the roles fit the actors' personalities and watching ""Antz"", you never feel like watching an 'animated film' but a film driven by fully written characters, not archetypes. And this contributes to very powerful sequences, there's one involving a fierce battle against termites, and this is almost as if ""Saving Private Ryan"" was made into animation, and I admire that. I love how DreamWorks went as far as making a soldier (Danny Glover) die in the arms of Z and not make a cliché out of it. I often blamed DreamWorks for relying too much on pop-culture tropes and celebrities but this is one of these times where it drove the plot in a nuanced and efficient way.<br/><br/>And the more I let ""Antz"" play in my mind, the more I reconsider my opinion about Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"", which made it in the box-office top 10 in 1998, unlike ""Antz"". But when I watched the Pixar's film, I knew I liked it but something was missing, too many characters I said in my review, I guess I meant 'not enough characterization', in ""Antz"", you have characters with opposite motives and opinions that sometimes overlap, but from these contrasts, believable and gripping conflicts result, not to mention very funny interactions. I can see why DreamWorks producers were so bugged about ""A Bug's Life"", this is a case where the lesser film won. Or maybe we should try to see what went wrong with ""Antz"".<br/><br/>Maybe it's the look of the ""Antz"", too brownish, too geometrical, compared to the cuter rotund faces of Disney, or the fact that you can't really sell a film to the kids if the main voice is Woody Allen, or maybe the parents thought one ant-themed film for the year was enough. Maybe there were improvements to be made in the visuals' department and looking at the following movie ""Shrek"", you can tell DreamWorks adopted a more Disney-like style without abandoning their tongue-in-cheek and adult friendly humor. And as a matter of fact, I wonder if the Pixar animators didn't try to pull some 'Antz"" humor in their 2001 movie ""Monsters & Inc."" It's funny how the two rival studios can inspire one another.<br/><br/>So, if ""A Bug's Life"" is a good film, ""Antz"" is a great one, so great it made the last Top 10 from the late critic Gene Siskel. It's even greater because you could tell the writers spent a few time studying ants and adapted some scientific facts into the film, the way they form a giant ball, the decapitated hand still capable to talk, the soldiers vs. workers shift. They could also add some human political questionings and philosophical issues like individualism vs. collectivity, and even feature war and romance. The film's as multi-layered as its underground setting.<br/><br/>Or maybe that was the problem, it was just too smartly 'underground' for its own good."

","A lot of my friends saw this movie before me and they all said that it was a great movie so I decided that I wanted to see it as well. I finally managed to get around to seeing it after a couple of months with my brother, and my brother loved the movie; I thought that it was pretty good as well. It seems to be a computer animated and the animation is quite good. Antz is based in an ant nest and focuses on a worker ant named Zee (Woody Allen). Zee is a bit upset with his life because it seems to be meaningless, but all of this changes when the princess pays him a visit in the pub and dances with him. The princess isn't really all that interested, she just wants a bit of fun before she gets married to a creep who is the general (Gene Hackman). After this Zee is a changed ant and he wants to see the princess again, and the only way he can do this is by switching places with Weezer (Sylvester Stallone) who is a warrior ant. Unfortunately for Zee the ants are off to a war which they are not supposed to win, but Zee comes back alive and is made a hero only to fall foul of the General's plots. This is a very clever movie and has a go at a number of aspects of society including hyper-individualism and hyper-conformity. I guess the main message is that forced conformity does not work because it undermines the moral of those forced to conform, but neither does hyper-individualism because one person is never really capable of doing anything. Napolean did not conquer all of Europe by himself but with the support of the French nation. Neil Armstrong did not reach the moon by himself, but with the support of many other technicians. Though this film is very anti-conformity most of the way through, the realisation at the end is that we cannot save ourselves, we must ultimately rely upon somebody else. The other theme is that the weakest elements of society are not expendable. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12, each person with each gift plays a part to support the whole. Everybody has their role to play in society and we cannot simply eliminate them because we think them to be useless. In Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy an entire civilisation was wiped out because of dirty telephones namely because they got rid of all of their telephone sanitisers, thinking them to be useless. Same goes in this movie, the worker ants may seem useless in war, but without them there would be no colony. Antz is a very clever movie and it also makes me think that Dreamworks is directly challenging Disney with movies. They released Deep Impact in rival to Touchstone's (Disney) Armegeddon, and same with Antz competing with A Bug's Life, and now they are also going down the Animation road with films like Prince of Egypt, and Disney attempts to compete with them by releasing animations as well. Antz is still a good movie and well worth seeing."
"TheDoctorAnd","9","0","0","17 February 2011"," Definitely watch it.
","I first saw this film in 2004, if I remember correctly, and I still watch it today.<br/><br/>Antz is the story of an ant called ""Z"" (don't let it's pronouncing as ""Zee"" put you off), who dreams of a world outside of the dull life of the ant worker in a colony filled with millions of ants. He sets off for a place called ""Insectopia"", a place in which ""You can be your own ant"", and ""The streets are paved with food"", with the colony's Princess. There, this proves to be true. Their fun is slightly short lived, however, when Colonel Cutter finds Princess Bala, and forcibly takes her back to the colony with him. However, the Colony's General, Mandible, is planning to create a stronger colony, by washing away the workers, who he considers to be ""Weak"". Can Z get back to the Colony in time to save the workers, Princess Bala, and the Queen?<br/><br/>I've only given it 9/10 because I feel that the film was, if anything, too short. I don't think we saw enough of Insectopia in the film's 83 minute length (including the credits), and I think seeing a bit of the colony's past may have been nice, and perhaps a bit of the Princess's life in the palace would have been good. Possibly a few flashbacks to Z's past would have been nice too.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is funny, and I enjoy the sarcastic character of Z, voiced by Woody Allen, a lot. Quite a few quotable lines, as well as a heart warming story that proves that no-one is insignificant. Definitely one of these ""Why hasn't this film got a sequel?"" films."
"Perception_de_Ambiguity","9","0","0","1 June 2010"," It's still as poignant and funny as it was when I first saw it back in 1998
","Yes, Z basically is a slightly more child-friendly version of Woody Allen's movie persona and the film is Annie Hall with an action plot built around it, but it works, even though the way the movie started (you hear Woody Allen's voice from the off for a while before the animated ant he is voicing is revealed lying on his psychiatrist's couch) it initially was difficult for me to accept Woody's voice as the voice of this piece of animation which moves it's mouth in sync but - and of this I was convinced - is not Woody Allen. But this passed quickly and the symbiosis came to fruition. But it proves how problematic it can be to use the voice of such an iconic person for an animated character.<br/><br/>The weakest element of the movie certainly is the villain, who is the clichÃ© war mongering general who in this case doesn't even have a reasonable motive for his evil plans (he wants to drown the whole colony pretty much just because), which is made worse by the fact that he has the final say on all decisions in the colony, so the only one who can save the day is our Z, since everybody else would be negatively affected by the general's plans simply is clueless.<br/><br/>The computer animation still looks good, although the motions don't always look as realistic as we got used by now. But the design of the ants still looks as unusual as it did the first day in a weirdly creative way. It also proved unexpectedly influential, as can be witnessed on MTV in the shape of Tila Tequila, whose team of plastic surgeons owes a lot to DreamWorks' creative minds in the art department. Who could have ever foreseen such an impact of ANTZ back in 1998, right? Talking about DreamWorks, this movie feels much more like a Pixar movie to me, given how clever it is and how much potential entertainment value for grownups it offers.<br/><br/>Now I have spent the whole review on only listing all the things it doesn't do well and a few things it does well, while saying nothing about why it is as as important a movie as it is (apart from the surgeon influence). Well, unfortunately I have run all out of time now and the greatness that is ANTZ really is self-explanatory. Should you be ignorant to all the good things that it brings you certainly can't be helped and probably are blind and dumb or simply a Woody Allen hater, because ANTZ easily is one of the very best Woody Allen films - even without being a Woody Allen film.<br/><br/>I rate it 9 out of 10 ant allegories which show us the insignificance of an individual in a mindless worker ant producing society that encourages unproductive work, and the power an individual can have to change at least his own life if he takes a stand against the system (and has a good portion of luck on his side as well)."

","Okay, as almost everyone already knows, Antz is part of the film battle list including films of similar style and story released during the same year. IE Antz/A Bugs Life. I think both films are very good, but most would probably say A Bugs Life takes the cake. Yeah, that's only because Disney, one of the biggest film companies in the world was backing it, along with every other Pixar movie for that matter. I thought A Bugs Life was good, but was too much like a kids movie for me. I think personally Antz appealed to a wider audience. Maybe not for little kids, but a wider audience none the less. I guess it's the mild level of vulgarity in Dreamworks animated movies that I like. They are a little more lenient with swearing and such, and ""cruder"" humor. Where as Disney has a threshold on making sure all dialogue is pretty much censored. So, in my opinion Antz is the winner. Just as funny as A Bugs Life, and actually it was a little more ""real"".

In this movie the audience can see a Kingdoom, then an state in emergency, then a dictator and then a democracy... and all the tricks and strategies necessaries to win.

","This film is an exceptional piece of animation. Where as a Bug's Life uses cutesy soft textured animation, the style in Antz is much grittier. Not only is the animation different, but there is different quality of voice acting and casting for the roles. The likes of Stallone, Lopez and Allen are perfectly suited to their roles and deliver one of there most memorable performances. Without giving too much away there is a battle scene which has a Starship Troopers-esque goriness that accentuates the horrors and futility in their lives that they are constantly burdoned with. On a basic level, the film is exciting enough with a fantastic balance of humour and action for younger audiences. But the underlying subtext and social commentary on humans in a style that differs from the moralising of Disney, is what differentiates this with many other cartoons."

It also contains a similar classic love story of the underdog getting the girl that is completely out of his league. However what most impresses me is the story line of complex politics that exsist in modern society.  The ant hill that they lived in basically worked as a socialistic society.  Each ant was born into a class and they were never to stray from that class and they were always to do their work without question.  Then you have a high ranking officer trying to increase his power through military force. I just love the parallels this film has to the politics of the U.S.S.R. in its hayday.

Thousands of ants show us a typical ant hive with a strict class structure and little individual freedom. This colony with its ""Mega"" construction projects is much more believable than the bunch of ants shown in ""A bug's life"".

Some mild profanity and crude humor explains the film's PG rating but if that can be ignored, this ranks as a fine family oriented film.

Along with the colony princess - played by Sharon Stone, the two ants try to find out whether there's a better world outside the colony.

These are starting to be a real pain in Disney films and, from the trailers I've seen, it looks like we'll have to endure them in `Bug's Life'.<br/><br/>I didn't notice any bad language, but I suppose all this might prove is how constant exposure inures us to it.  Yes, there are some dark moments but, in the UK, Antz does have a Parental Guidance rating.<br/><br/>And, anyway, who says animated films have to be for kids?"

","Antz, from Dreamwork pictures, works on every level. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible and the expressions on the characters' faces brought a sense of absolute realism to the film. The political overtones would probably go over the heads of most young teens, but high school and above will love it. The voices were ""right on"" with special  performances by Woody Allen as ""Z"" a lovable ant who hates his life moving dirt from one place to another. Sharon Stone as Bala is love interest, Gene Hackman as General Mandible. Christopher Walken as Col. Cutter and Danny Glover as Barbados. This is a movie experience that you don't want to miss.

The individuality theme is well explored, and the fact that each character strongly resembles its voice provider is a clever touch.  Dreamworks have found a formula which seems set to turn 'Toontown on its head, and I believe that a spate of similar movies will follow.

","I have never seen such an amazing piece of animation in my life. Everything was so real and rich that at points you would swear that these were actual living creatures. The facial features, the range and flow of movement, everything! The dialouge was funny and energetic, Woody Allen was at his neurotic best and Christopher Walken's character almost seemed to be written for him. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was the fact that, for the tots the dialogue was a little too rich and sometimes a little too vulgar (just a few minor infractions). There was also a scene where the ants head out to attack the termites and a pretty violent and bloody battle ensues, I will admit it was awesome but. . . (pretty intense for animation war). Overall a love, revolution, good vs. evil story; great dialogue, but parents be prepared."

Well, Zee, actually - it is an American ant!<br/><br/>This film is not good because it has a thrilling storyline - it hasn't; Nor because it has a complex interwoven plot which keeps you on the edge of your seat right to the final credits - it hasn't;  Nor because it examines in ruthless detail and satirical probing, humankind in allegory - it doesn't. No, this film is good, because it is good.<br/><br/>Telling a familiar story,  the awakening within a person (ant) of something beyond the mundane and the search for utopia (insectopia in the film), combining excellent characterisations and truly awesome visual imagery courtesy of the ever present CGI industry, works a treat. Woody Allen, sans body, is perfect, as are each of the other voice characters.  This may be one of the best things Stallone has ever done. All the voices are superb, and without the distractions of the bodies, you really appreciate them for the first time.  This is a much, much better film than ""Small Soldiers"". Nearly 5-star but not quite.<br/><br/>There are no huge surprises; no real shocks (just one maybe); the good guys beat the bad guys; some movie and war clichÃ©s are paid tribute to along the way (including a battle scene pulled straight from ""Starship Troopers"") and the final scene is epic in its smallness.

Anyway, this gave it all a great sense of realism and made these cartoons look lifelike, greatly adding to the audience believing in what they were watching. Not necessarily aimed at kids, in fact, probably not at all, what with the ageing Woody Allen barely known to those under 15, he was a perfect example of himself as we all know and love him - and starring alongside Stallone and Stone, with Dan Akroyd, Christopher Walken and Danny Glover all adding to the A-List name-dropping. All well worth their parts. A highly amusing film, the first half being non-stop laughing and amazement at the animation - the only time I noticed that it was actually computer generated was the end flooding scene...but I've tried animating water, and what they did was incredible......completely recommended to any one who likes any of the actors, or to people who just want some light entertainment - the social commentary and class struggle was well covered, and I can't find any major faults that you'll complain about after seeing this film.

The movie seems to be both an endorsement and a condemnation of Communism. The working class revolts against the fascist monarchy, but then again, the revolution's leader, Z(Woody Allen), bemoans the abscence of free-will and individualism. There's even a visit to ""Insectopia"" that shows why the concept of ""communal living"" never survived the 60's. That's alot of Socio-political theorizing for a cartoon!

Antz makes baby Jesus cry!<br/><br/>Antz is a classic Woody Allen film, 'tis true, and I expect he had a bit of a hand in writing Z's script. The neat thing about the film, though, is that all of the characters are sterotypes of their voice actors. Imagine Stallone, Hackman or Walken as ants, and bingo!, that's how they are. Playing their perfect roles, they all do a sterling job, although Walken's character, Colonel Cutter, only has one real sinister 'Walkeny' scene, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Animation is really a liberating medium, and they took good advantage of it. Visually the film is superb; the grand caverns are amazing, and a traditionally difficult piece of animation, water, is done really well. I was impressed. The sound was great, with a fantastic score - and NO, this isn't a Disney film (it was made by Dreamworks SKG), so the ants do not sing, thank the stars.<br/><br/>All up, Dreamworks have made a fine animated comedy. It's not a film for kids - just because it's animated doesn't mean it has to be aimed at small children/christians; it's only a little less sophisticated than an ordinary Woody Allen film (whatever that means).

","There's no doubt that the technical advances in the film making business are downright amazing. The insects  in Antz (don't ya just lurve the spelling???) are completely computer generated by the Dream Works studio in association with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Speilberg. The industry has come a long long way since those few tortuous bits of bytes in Jurassic Park not all that many years ago. But sometimes we humans can get just a little bit too clever, or perhaps not smart enough, and Antz, although commendable, has neither the fantasy element needed for a good children's film, nor the realism needed for a decent adults flick. Antz is pretty entertaining, and visually it is every bit as stunning as Toy Story, although Antz is more sophisticated and  has a much darker look than the suburban Toy Story.  As you can imagine, much of the action in Antz takes place underground. Antz tells of an ant called Z (voiced by Woody Allen) who doesn't want to just be one of the crowd. He has an illicit romance with a princess ant (Sharon Stone) and they break the mould and come into conflict with the status quo. There are heaps of references to politics, movie genres, sexual angst and therapy, as you'd expect from a story  starring a Woody Allen type off character. But can an animated film effectively portray complicated emotions? Not so far it seems. The ants in Antz have faces that are almost human, but that then becomes disappointing, because so far the craft hasn't got any where near being able to really display the complexities of a human face.<br/><br/>We love faces. We spend our lives studying the extremely subtle messages a tiny tremor of an eyebrow or lip might portray; to such an extent that we often don't even consciously realise how subtle we are as observers. If film makers are going to step towards trying to depict real human faces on animated creatures, and not leave animated films where they have been so far; a film world where it is obvious that the creatures, the faces, and the personalities are only two dimensional and shallow, then they will continue to disappoint movie goers."

The animation is superb, excellent to say the least, and the characters are believable.<br/><br/>Unlike Disney films, this movie is realistic. We don't have a sporty, handsome, sure-of-themselves hero type, nor the fair damsel in distress that falls for him. The secondary characters don't take away the spotlight (Pocahontas, anyone?), plus the villains here aren't bumbling idiots that reveal their plans to everyone in the first half hour of the film like so many Disney-esque chars. seem to do quite often.<br/><br/>Once and for all, the dialogue is pretty good too. I remember sitting in the row, and when one of the characters swore, a mother behind me began talking about how this wasn't suitable for her eleven-year-old child. What are you bitching about? Yes, you heard me! I've gone to the elementary school and hear kids in like grade two swear up a streak! It seems that the only people concerned with the language in this film are the over-protective parents. Alright, I'm 15, so I haven't lost the touch that kids have, and I have a word for you parents: Your kids do use those words... not when you're there of course, but they do.<br/><br/>As well, the fight scene and others of violence were believable too. It was true... in Disney films, someone can get beat up, stabbed or even shot with an arrow, and do you see any blood? No, of course not. Well, the war scene in this had an eerie quality that actually made it look real. Everyone was on the edge of their seats that time.<br/><br/>Perhaps if people paid attention to the facts that the characters were good, the story plot was pretty well laid out and the animation was absolutely brilliant, instead of remembering the swearing and the fact that it wasn't Disney, then they would get the full impact of the show.<br/><br/>It was realistic, it was human... that's all that matters"

Not so this flick:  go see it for the tons of subtle visual puns and throwaway jokes that are constantly in the background.  The attention to detail is astounding:  in the bar scene, the aphids (antly analogue for beer bottles) are placed without fanfare on plant stems between each use, so that they might replenish their juices.  Don't take your children if they are very young: there's a scene of terrifying violence early in the movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I couldn't give a flying flip about language in a movie, for the most part, but the language in this movie bothered me:  it was clearly geared toward the rating.  To wit:  a blissed-out hippy fly says, ""this tastes like crap.""  Now, I know Spielberg has spent time around hippies; I know that he knows how they talk.  And let me tell you what, ""crap"" isn't the word a hippy would use there, any more than a mad New York executive would shout to his secretary, ""Sheila, get in here, gosh darn it!""

","I don't know where some of these people are from, but where I'm at kids know and use words like damn, hell, crap and bitching by the time they're seven or eight at least. That's how it was when I was growing up. If you don't want your kid hearing the language in this film, you better not let them go to school; I guarantee you they'll hear far worse language there. This film is not for little kids less than 5; it's PG for a reason, and not just the language. You should know that if it's rated PG, it's probably not meant for kids 5 years old or younger, so if you take kids that young to this film, you have only yourself to blame, not the studio or filmmakers.  Otherwise, if your kids are older than 5, don't let a few uptight people keep you and them from seeing a really good, really fun movie. I for one am glad someone was willing to make an animated film that satisfies both adults and kids. I hope DreamWorks keeps it up and puts out more films like this, and doesn't let their movies be ruined by trying to please everyone."

"Movie-12","6","0","0","12 October 1998"," Visually Satisfying but lacks interest. **1/2 out of ****
","I want to start my review of  ""Antz"" by asking an easy question: What does Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, Jennifer Lopez & Danny Glover have in common. No, not that they all live in Hollywood. Each and every one of them contributes their wonderful voice in this movie, which I may say, is the first animated movie from DreamWorks Studio, and benefits from the help of filmmaker Jeffrey Katzenberg, who earlier oversaw the renaissance in Disney animation, and Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>
I also wish to explain to you that even the biggest names in the movie business, which is what this movie contains, and the other pluses of the production do absolutely nothing for the film and minds well have been absent from it. Sure, my star rating was certainly boasted because of them, but in the end, the main and final flaw in this movie is the fact that the movie offers noting of interest to an audience. An ant's  life is the story presented here and quite frankly, I couldn't care less about an ant's life, really.<br/><br/>The ant who is magnified in ""Antz"" is voiced appropriately by Woody Allen, as a nautical insect who is named Z. He lives in the ground in a deep, dark colony as everyone else does, and has an important job in his colony; to work and obey orders given to him. And after many years of doing so, Z is starting to wonder why he has to, and why no one else wonders this, or what purpose does his mining server.<br/><br/>There is another main ant in this movie, Bala, voiced beautifully by Sharon Stone, whose job is to be the future monarch and lay millions of eggs 24 hours a day. She is not too fond of that idea, especially because there is no fun involved with her life. She sneaks out of confinement one day and managers to present herself to the nerdy looking Z and dance with him during a daily festival. But when Bala is caught, Z asks when they will be able to meet once again and she states ""Never.""<br/><br/>Z soon catches on that Bala is the princes and so onÂ… that there's about an upcoming soldier march to be presented in front of the royal family. So he asks his massively muscular ant friend, Barbatus (Stallone) who is a soldier to trade places with him for  that event. He says yes and lots of plot twist happen after the tuning point. I could bore (or excite) you with the pathetic story point for the next several paragraphs but I am not that mean, so I will stop there and let the imagination carry through.<br/><br/>
I loved the images of the movie. It is fully computer animated and tries to measure up to the magnificent ""Toy Story"" and ""Small Soldiers"" but doesn't come close to the visual pleasure. You see, those movies: 1) Offered something more than watching an urban insect's adventures, 2) had lots of brilliant colors. ""Antz"" gives us two colors; light brown for the ants' bodies, dark brown for the colonies' walls. There are some instances that prove me wrong but for the most part, the only visual enjoyment in this film comes half way thought.<br/><br/>I can't recommend ""Antz"" for the reason of it didn't do much for me. I give the film a marginal thumbs down because I am one-hundred percent sure that a large majority of an audience will enjoy this picture to the extreme. A one line summary of the movie in my point of view: ""Toy Story"" meets ""Starship Troopers"" from an ant's point of view."

But after a few minor projectionist glitches early on, I soon found myself engrossed into this film. Not only is the animation totally believable, and the attention to detail awe inspiring, but also the story kept us into the entire film.  I cannot recall any points where the film seemed to drag. Also, be aware that this is not a ""slap-on-you-knee"" comedy.  I would say that it is more of a satire. And, not that it is rated PG due to some language.

It wasn't just another kiddie-flick, the humour was surprisingly sophisticated. Woody Allen did what he does best: playing the neurotic ant, alongside Sylvester Stallone as a Rambo-esque ant, Sharon Stone as the princess of the colony and Christopher Walken as (duh!) the evil ant.

"Jerkle","10","0","0","8 October 1998"," The film was great, but is it for kids?
","First of all, I loved Antz.  Dreamworks and PDI have amazed me in their animated debut, and the story was great fun.  The script read like a more lighthearted version of one of Woody Allen's films, and being a fan of both Allen and animation, the combination entertained me to such a degree, I went and saw it again.  My only problem with it is that it seems to ignore the fact that kids are flocking to see animated films.  The swearing that the characters do (mind you, it is limited) shocked me simply because I was not expecting it from an animated film geared towards the G-rated audience. Also, some of the battle scenes were violent to the point of possibly frightening younger viewers.  However, if the audience is 10 or older, Antz is one of the most sophisticatedly hilarious films I have seen, animated or not, in a long time."
"Laurel-3","Null","0","0","7 October 1998"," Why do the characters look like their voice-over actors?
","I read in Entertainment Weekly a while back that when the animators first started this film, the character of Z looked ""too much"" like Woody Allen, and the animators had to change Z's look several times. They succeeded in their attempt--in the movie, Z doesn't look much like Allen. My question, however, is why do some of the other characters look like the actors that provide their voices? The ones that stand out the most are Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), Barbatus (Danny Glover) and Azteca (Jennifer Lopez). Of course Barbatus ""looks"" like a black man--how stereotypical. I'm not a big Jennifer Lopez follower, but I swear I'd recognize those lips anywhere... What happened to the creativity of animation? Isn't it more fun to ""figure out"" whose voice is bringing life to that animated character rather than having it ""shown"" to the audience? I know Sly's voice is pretty easy to identify, but so is Allen's--the creators obviously put some work into designing a unique ant look for his character, a look that made the movie more interesting to watch. Come on, guys--this is what you're paid for! Give us a creative look of an animated character, not just an ""cartoon"" Stallone!"
"niteman","10","0","0","7 October 1998"," Antz is a great kids movie for grown-ups.
","The refreshing thing about Dreamworks SKG is that they don't appear to care very much about how marketable their films are.  Heck, the guys are millionaires, right?  This summer, for example, they made an action movie with believable characters and not much action (Deep Impact, which compared to Armageddon was practically a Merchant Ivory film).  And now with Antz they turn the world of children's animation on its ear.  This is stuff that Disney would never dare: No songs (or catchy broadway soundtrack), no bright colors, no hip sidekicks, No over-the-top villain.  Antz is edgy, and much of the humor adult. The PG rating isn't fooling around, you'll find three damns, a 'hell,' and a 'bitching' in here, as well as lines like ""I'm sorry, but drinking from the anus of another creature isn't my cup of tea.""  And yet Antz succeeds as a children's movie in spite, or perhaps because of its willingness to jettison the pop-culture junk that permeated Disney's Hercules, as well as the preachiness that ruined Pocahontas.  The paint-by-numbers plotting of recent animated movies is all but gone, as well -- the villain's master plan isn't fully fleshed out until the end of the film, instead of telegraphed in the first five minutes.  Antz is something of an oddity as a children's movie because it feels so completely *new*, every idea fresh, every plot twist unexpected.  When was the last time you watched a kid's movie and weren't sure how it was going to end?  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Antz looks GREAT.  The characters look real, not merely computer generated, and the Ant's eye view of the world is entrancing and nearly flawless (occasionally, the backgrounds look too static, but that's a minor quibble).   All in all, Antz is a fine movie.  Very young children should not be taken to see it, however; they will miss the humor, might be bored by some of the chattier scenes, and will most certainly be frightened by a termite/ant battle scene early on (heck, it frightened ME.  Those termites were nasty).  But anyone over the age of ten will be entranced by Antz' vision.  This is a film to see more than once, simply to appreciate the wit lurking behind the scenes (For example, in the ant/termite battle, every soldier on either side is killed except one ant.  The ants have a victory parade, and one sign reads ""One - nothing.  We win.""  If that's not skewering satire, tell me what is).  Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"" will most certainly be more lively and bright than Antz, and more kid-friendly.  But it will also be safer, more predictable, and more clearly aimed at the bottom line (that is, selling toys and soundtracks).  Antz is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and will be fun for children and adults alike."

","This is one animated movie that is just too good and clever to be left to the kids, though they will certainly be entertained by the imaginative characterisations, exciting storyline, funny sequences and expressive music. But in addition to these basic merits, adults will also enjoy the way the main CGI-produced characters have been adjusted to the actors providing the voices, rather than the other way round. This applies especially, of course, to Z (Woody Allen) who embodies not only Allen's neurosis, but that awkward, questioning individuality that so often goes along with neurosis; and which is particularly awkward for a worker-ant, supposed to conform to the totalitarian norm with every fibre of its being. <br/><br/>With gentle-giant soldier-ant Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), autocratic General Mandible (Gene Hackman) and his smooth sidekick, Col Cutter (Christopher Walken), also, the personalities of the voicers - or at least of the human characters they often play - have been successfully incorporated into the animated figures. This aspect of the movie is perhaps not so marked with the female characters - the Queen (Ann Bancroft), Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) and Z's friend Azteca (Jennifer Lopez), which may be because actresses are less typecast in Hollywood movies than their male counterparts. <br/><br/>A dominant feature of the film is its strong political message in favour of individual liberty and freedom of choice, a message which carries more weight because it is delivered not by some super-hero, but by arch-nebish Z. Yet despite this theme of the individual, the climactic image of the film is one of teamwork, with the ants voluntarily combining their strength and agility to save themselves and each other, by forming a precarious tower of bodies supported by the strong-limbed and even stronger-hearted Weaver."

Z falls in love with Princess Bala who was supposed to marry General Mandible. Mandible hates Z and all the other ""worker ants"" and wants to kill all of them.

","""Antz"" is a thoroughly involving film, filled to the brim with lovingly constructed visuals and a number of clever plot twists.  If it contained nothing more than entertaining visuals and humorous characters, the film would be perfectly acceptable.  But the creators didn't rest on their laurels; surprisingly, ""Antz"" sneaks a fair amount of social commentary into its frames.  It's not hard to recognize ourselves and modern society in the movie, which is perhaps the reason the tale works so well: we all know people who act like the various inhabitants of the ant hill.<br/><br/>The intelligence of the screenplay was one of the biggest (and nicest) surprises for me.  In addition to the predictable (though admittedly well done) gags involving magnifying glasses and picnics, ""Antz"" depicts a level of religious satire uncommon in what's ostensibly a kids' movie.  Social satire also appears -- the story's biggest laugh comes when an insightful worker ant experiences a revelation: ""The workers control the means of production!"""

","The first computer-generated feature from Dreamworks is ambitious indeed. Featuring a cast of A-list actors right down to the smallest supporting roles, it's a story that works in most areas and falls a little flat in just a few sections.  It's a well-written story with an ending that is just a little too neat and tidy.  Another MINOR quibble I had was that, with so many famous voices, I was sometimes distracted from the story by trying to guess whose voice I was hearing.<br/><br/>Comparisons to Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"" are inevitable, with supporters and detractors on both sides.  ""Bugs"" seemed targeted more on kids, but had an overall slickness in story and execution that seems lacking in ""Antz."" ""Antz"" was a little more sophisticated in its humor and approach to realism, but a lot if it was dark.  Also, the visual style of the animation in ""Antz"" seemed to be trying a little too hard.  The makers utilized a system of animation where the faces of the characters were given actual muscle systems to mimic the movement of human faces.  While technically admirable, the overall effect made it look like real faces were plastered onto computer figures and manipulated digitally -- it didn't look awfully real.  Of course, neither did ""Bug's Life"", but ""Bugs"" was from beginning to end a cartoon; it did not aspire to anything more lofty.  ""Antz"" did and fell short.<br/><br/>But that's just me.

","I was one of many students who watched the videotape of ""Antz"" in Ms. Caracello's senior government class (what the hell does this have to do with government anyway?) and I actually enjoyed it! Probably one of the better films she has subjected the class to in a long time. For those who have not seen it, you're in for a treat. Antz is chalk full of comedy, terrific one-liners, and other subtle humor. The animation is semi-descent, flawless for the most part. The voices are also great. I loved Gene Hackman's portrayal of the evil leader, as well as Christopher Walken's portrayal of one of Hackman's foot soldiers. Although this is a somewhat predictable story, it does have its highlights, the ""Insectopia"" sub plot for example. Antz is probably more suitable for adults rather than kids.

","It seems to me that Antz is one of Hollywood's first attempts at making animation for adults on a grand scale.  For years other countries like Japan have understood that it is not the medium in which a film is created, but the story behind it that counts. Antz has taken that concept to the U.S. and I am very happy that they did.  <br/><br/>I have nothing against Disney animation.... as a matter of fact, I enjoy most of it, but Antz is definitely not a Disney film.  It is an adult film that children may enjoy.  It is aimed at the adult, but marketed for children.  Woody Allen was his typical neurotic self.  Sly Stallone played one of his best roles in years. And Christopher Walken was great as usual. Check it out if you get the chance.  <br/><br/>P.S. This movie may not be a great idea for extremely young children.  There are a few brutal war scenes which might scare a young child (the termite battle for those of you that have seen the movie).  You may want to view it before showing it to a child, just to make sure it isn't too violent for them."

Refreshingly, this was more sophisticated than most animated features, and I can only assume that adults may have enjoyed this more than the kids.  While it is lacking in zany humor and outrageous characters that are standard in many animated films, it still succeeds thanks to a more cerebral approach that includes more subtle comedy, as well as some surprisingly graphic (but effective) violence.

","While watching Antz, it is always tempting to compare it with the similarly themed and CGI-ed ""A Bug's Life"" from Disney.<br/><br/>In fact, doing so only detracts from both as, despite many thematic similarities, they are very different films. The Disney film is, as you would expect, the more saccharine and self-consciously humorous of the two. It scores over Antz by brimming with inventiveness, particularly the scenes where Flik is in the underworld. These scenes often reference latter day cartoons, including ""Hoppity Goes To Town"", and feature memorable scenes such as the Bloody Mary-drinking mosquito and the slug that forgot not to order salt with his burger. However, while a slight homage is made to the works of the 30s and 40s, the CGI on both these films is of the period and absolutely magnificent. Where this fails is in the fact that it is no longer groundbreaking, as it was when attempted with ""Toy Story"". To this end, Toy Story is spoofed during the truly inspired ""outtakes"" sequence at the climax.<br/><br/>Antz, however, is the story I awarded the highest marks (7 to A Bug's Life 6). A Bug's Life is a children's film which adults can enjoy, Antz is an adult film which children may not enjoy or even comprehend. It would be overstating it to say Antz has depth, but certainly a cartoon feature with themes and images of genocide, decapitated corpses and graphic physical violence is not the sort of thing you'd want to show your newly-borns. While the basic plot is the same - ant leaves colony in disgrace only to return in triumph - the basic motivation is different. In the Disney vehicle, Flik leaves with the urge to return. In Antz, Z (Woody Allen) WANTS to leave. In all this is mixed up an Orwellian parable and the nature of individualism and choice. Not exactly Tom and Jerry.<br/><br/>Woody Allen, while a fine comedian in his own films, is far better when out of context. He ALWAYS plays the neurotic Jewish New Yorker, but when that Jewish New Yorker is the chief villain in a James Bond movie (The only reason to watch Casino Royale) or an ant on a psychiatrist's couch bemoaning ""never being able to lift more than ten times my own bodyweight"", then it borders on genius. Antz also scores over its rival by having a smaller set of characters, with only (more or less) ants to make up the cast. No show-stealing fleas, ladybirds or caterpillars for this movie.<br/><br/>But where A Bug's Life had Kevin Spacey as a villainous grasshopper, the only real protagonist in Antz is the stifling lifestyle of conformity. It's the better film, but is it any wonder less people went to see it?"

","""Antz"" is an enjoyable, engaging contemporary fable that gracefully illuminates the value of group cooperation as well as personal individuality and integrity.  The voice casting is gleefully on target; you can't help but love a movie that includes both Woody Allen and Sylvester Stallone.  The computer animation is absolutely first-rate, drawing the viewer into the story rather than calling attention to itself; the individual characters voiced by Allen, Stallone, and Sharon Stone are especially effective.  In its heart of hearts, this is a Woody Allen picture--the situations, humor, and neuroses are all classic Allen.  The opening and closing panoramas make it clear that the movie itself knows that it's a Woody Allen picture.  The movie may be a bit too intense in places for extremely young children; one battle scene, featuring an assault upon the ants by monolithic termites, bears more than a passing resemblance to the ""bug attack"" sequences featured in last year's ""Starship Troopers.""  DreamWorks is to be especially commended for resisting the marketing temptation so eagerly embraced by Disney in ""A Bug's Life."""

","In my view, some of the best movies are those that show the viewer something from a never before seen world/existence.  This could be our world, just seen from a different perspective, or it could be an entirely new world, that we never even conceived could exist (like in one of my favorite films, ""Dark City"").  Antz falls into the first category.<br/><br/>The very first shot sets the tone of the film, when we see the shadowy outlines of what appear to be skyscrapers in the horizon, only to discover that they are merely blades of grass. After a terrific introduction to the lead character/ant Z, played by Woody Allen (in his best role to date that I have seen), the viewer is given a first look at the ant colony.  It is here that one sees the extremes to which the filmmakers have taken their technological advances.<br/><br/>The creators took something as simple as an ant hill, and created an awe-inspiring visual tour-de-force.  Many people argue that ""A Bugs Life"" was the superior film when it came out, but this opening shot tops anything you see in that film (not that that movie isn't fantastic as well).  The first half of Antz takes place inside of this world, with one exception (the termite war, which I'll go into later) but in the second half, the animators top themselves by taking Z and another ant, Princess Bala, out into our world.<br/><br/>It is here that the film becomes, in essence, a computer animated, and vastly superior remake of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."" Blades of grass tower over the ants, and drops of water can be fatal.  Eventually, they find themselves at a picnic (a fitting place for two ants to end up), and Z speaks one of my 2 favorite lines (I won't ruin it, but it involves the plastic wrapping around a sandwich).  Unfortunately, the biggest problem I had with the movie occurred during this, otherwise great scene.  Towering above the ants are various, giant forms of product placement, such as cans of Pepsi and Mountain Dew.  At this point, it feels like the movie has turned into a commercial.<br/><br/>The climax to this scene involves the two ants stuck by gum to the bottom of a shoe.  Z's line right before they are released from the gum is the other of my 2 favorite lines.  The delivery is hilarious.<br/><br/>In fact, the whole movie is hilarious.  As I stated earlier, there is a battle sequence between the ants and some termites (with the song ""The Ants Go Marching Home Again"" triumphantly playing in the background) that, as expected, was truly fantastic.  The final conversation during this scene, between Z and another ant played be Danny Glover, is very unexpected, but highly humorous.  It was a terrific way to end the most intense part of the film (for a kid's movie).<br/><br/>In short, this is not a film for everyone.  Many children will be bored, and I have talked to many people who did not have the same reaction I did. However, as far as I am concerned, this was one of the best films of 1998, and I was very upset when I found out it didn't get any Academy Award nominations.  But then again, many terrific films were ignored, while many mediocre films were heaped with nominations.<br/><br/>After seeing a movie like this, I can only imagine what ground-breaking films we have to look forward to.

The animation could be a tad more colorful (I preferred A BUG'S LIFE in this department), and the story bogged down at times.  However, it's nice to see an animated film trying for more than just mush, but actually try to say something, even if it wasn't quite sure what it was saying at times.  Also, casting Woody Allen as the voice of Z was a stroke of genius.  Like Robin Williams in ALADDIN, he makes it funny just by showing up.  The other actors doing voices were all good as well.  Finally, it was nice not to suffer through badly written songs for the movie, but hearing good songs, like ""I Can See Clearly Now"" and ""Almost Like Being in Love,"" being used."

","A previous reviewer erroneously commented that ""Antz"" was released a year after ""A Bug's Life""; I distinctly remember that it was released a month BEFORE the latter. Comparisons between the two may abound, and most people told me that the latter - which I've never seen - was better, but I'm content just knowing the former. As is well known, it portrays Z (Woody Allen) trying to come to terms with his life as a worker ant while also trying to develop a relationship with Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), and in the process uncovers a conspiracy. You read that right: a cartoon dealing with a conspiracy.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very neat movie. Aside from one clever idea after another (""...get in touch with my inner maggot...""), the cast is quite impressive: Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, and Sylvester Stallone, to name a few.

"rebeljenn","4","2","5","10 October 2005"," a good idea but overall failure
","Antz and A Bug's Life were both released in the same year, and both films competed with each other for an audience. Despite both films feature bugs as the heroes and the villains, the films are too different to really be compared. A Bug's Life is my personal favourite of the two, but it's not by much. It is simply a little more engaging. However, Antz uses a clever concept and focuses more on the world of the ant. The film can be enjoyed by adults and children, and like A Bug's Life, it is educational and entertaining.<br/><br/>Antz is a story of individualism, which is an unusual concept in the world of ants. In fact, it is a little bit like communism. Everyone works, but nothing brings out the individual. For the most part, all ants look and act the same... but our little ant clearly stands out. It is he who saves the day because of his individuality and his ability to think.<br/><br/>Although there are some good ideas and good story-telling behind this film, overall, it fails to really see it through and make a big impact. A Bug's Life was more entertaining and quickly paced, and it doesn't possess the sappy love story like Antz does. A Bug's Life also succeeds a little more with the family, whereas a lot of the story in Antz is just dull. I would recommend this film to children, but I would not bother recommending it to adults."

","We all know the drill about DreamWorks' Antz being compared to Pixars A Bug's Life. I think they both succeeded in their own ways. While A Bug's Life was more kid oriented, Antz offered much more adult material and cleverness. <br/><br/>Due to their similarities, I won't say that much about it, but briefly highlight what I think is good about Antz. <br/><br/>Antz has a voice cast of great actors, who add so much to the characters. Adults who have seen Woody Allen, Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken will recognize the immediately. It can be distracting at times, but it is admirable that Dreamworks' first feature managed such a great cast. <br/><br/>The different insects depicted in Antz are much more realistically rendered, given the fact that insects are different sizes. <br/><br/>It has a battle scene which is memorable and dark. Maybe scary to the youngest kids, but great. <br/><br/>The conflict of our main character Z is superior to the conflict in A Bug's Life. Z is a neurotic ant who doesn't feel special given the fact that every ant in the colony from birth is placed either as a soldier or a worker. Z wants something different, but the general ant is against all sorts of ""weakness"" and plots a cleansing of the weak ants and take over the colony. <br/><br/>While it is good, the villainous general could have been more threatening and memorable, but it is a minor thing. <br/><br/>Antz may lack the brightness and colours of A Bug's Life and could perhaps use a little more laughs, but it surely is worth watching."

","Woody Allen lends his distinctive voice and personality to the role of ""Z"", a lowly worker ant in an ant colony. He's become awfully tired of his inconspicuous, drab existence, and the idea of living only to follow orders. He becomes smitten with the colony's princess (voice of Sharon Stone), and in order to impress her, switches places with his soldier pal Weaver (voice of Sylvester Stallone), and inadvertently becomes a war hero. But what he really wants is to find a fabled ""Insectopia""; he must also expose the nefarious plan of a general named Mandible (voice of Gene Hackman).<br/><br/>Written by Chris & Paul Weitz, with Todd Alcott, this is a funny and clever animated comedy from Dreamworks and PDI, the company that hit it big with the ""Shrek"" series. It does have a message about the benefits of thinking and acting for oneself, but it wouldn't really be for the youngest of viewers in one's family. There is some mild intensity and language. It would indeed have the most resonance for Allen fans, although the whole cast is well utilized. Other celebrities voicing characters are Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin as a pair of wasps, Anne Bancroft as the Queen ant, Danny Glover as a soldier ant, Jennifer Lopez as a worker named Azteca, John Mahoney as an old barfly ant, Paul Mazursky as Z's psychologist, Christopher Walken as a loyal colonel, and Grant Shaud as a foreman.<br/><br/>There's enough slick animation, visual effects, and action sequences to make it all pretty fun, along with good music by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell. Some grandiose gags involve the comparative size of ants to humans, as Z and Bala discover a picnic spread. People are sure to love the character designs, and be amused by the philosophical exchange between a mosquito and a beetle.<br/><br/>Solid entertainment, overall.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","The first strength of this film is that it features Woody Allen in the principle role. The ant he plays delivers the self absorbed and fearful lines that Woody delivers in each of the films he is in. Here he plays an ant who is part of the collective. He realizes his only significance is a cog in the the machine that, for all practical purposes, reproduces itself but never evolves. He meets a female ant and the two have similar issues. There are all the expected pitfalls, and they make their respective ways toward a kind of utopia for crawly things. This is really quite delightful. I believe it came out close to the time ""A Bug's Life"" did."

","Z (Zee not Zed; he is American) is a worker ant who is fed up with his lot in life; he wants to be allowed to make some choices but that isn't the way life works in the ant colony. One day as he moans about things to his friend, a soldier ant Weaver, in a bar Princess Bala visits the incognito to see how the lower orders live. She ends up dancing with Z but his individual dancing style leads to trouble and she is rushed to safety; it is only then that Z learns who she was. Determined to see her again he swaps place with Weaver at a military review. He doesn't realise that the assembled soldiers are about to be sent on a certain death mission to attack a termite nest! Somehow he is the sole survivor. He returns to the colony a hero but he soon crosses paths the General Mandible, who has rather drastic plans for the colony. Z escapes with a somewhat unwilling Bala. Outside the colony they make their way to the fabled 'Insectopia'. On the way they face a variety of perils then just as things look good for them Bala is grabbed at taken back to Mandible. Z is determined to see her again and ultimately the two of them will have to save the colony from Mandible's evil plans.<br/><br/>1998 saw two animated films about an ant that didn't do what was expected of him and became a hero; this and Disney/Pixar's 'A Bug's Life'; while I slightly preferred the latter this is still a lot of fun and will probably appeal to older children a bit more. There is a greater sense of threat and the villain is more unpleasant. Mandible is clearly meant to be a Nazi with his plans to 'cleanse' the colony of its weaker members the very workers who built it. The battle against the termites features death and surprisingly for a PG rated film reminded me of a toned down version of the battle scenes in 'Starship Troopers'! There are some funny moments but this is more about the drama than comedy. The cast is almost entirely made up of actors who one wouldn't usually associate with animated films; notable Woody Allen, as Z; Sharon Stone, as Bala; Sylvester Stallone, as Weaver, and Gene Hackman, as General Mandible; they, along with the rest of the cast, do a fine job. The animation is pretty good given that it is almost twenty years old now. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of animated films."

","Antz was the second computer animated film after Toy Story as well as the first from Dreamworks. It is one of those controversial pictures for being very parallel to another movie--A Bug's Life. While A Bug's Life is a nicer family movie, Antz is an edgier ugly movie. After not watching this in nearly 17 years, I decided to check it out after seeing a list of movie copycats. I do not like CGI movies thinking they are clichéd, but Antz is definitely one of the few exceptions.<br/><br/>Take one look at Antz and it is evident that it is a edgier than A Bug's Life. But I was shocked to see just how insane it was. Thinking it was going to be a movie for 10-year-olds, there was brutal violence, alcohol abuse, and actual profanity. An ant is drinking at a bar and I thought it was a little bit odd for a kid movie, then Sylvester Stallone's character actually says ""bitchin'."" After he says that, I was suckered in and thirsting for more.<br/><br/>In Woody Allen's only animated role, he plays a little factory ant named Z who tries to find importance in his life. He falls in love with a Princess and switches place with his soldier friend (Stallone) in an upcoming battle with termites to impress her. Right away, the writing is witty and genius; easily the best writing I've heard in a movie like this, not because of any swearing. The battle is intense and creepy to some. Death is also played about pretty wild. A sole survivor, he returns and kidnaps the Princess. Her fiancé, General Mandible (Hackman) wants to destroy all factory workers, but Z's act of individualism sparks a revolution. Right after watching this, I saw Gene Siskel ranked it as the 7th best movie of 1998. I would also rank it 7th best of the year. It really is that good.<br/><br/>4/4"

It is pure magic for Dreamworks (who also did Shrek) to amaze us with such technology. It's not that Pixar is any better in computer animation, but the computer anime in Antz just dosen't live up to the astonishing animation of that of Pixar.<br/><br/>I have to say though, maybe Antz had better vocal talents and famous actors to voice there characters, while all A Bug's Life had was Kevin Spacey. I don't think that makes the film any worse or better, but it certainly had better vocal talents.<br/><br/>There isn't much to say about Antz, I enjoyed the film, but I had too high of expectations for it, and it let me down.

","Were it not for ""AntZ"" and ""Akira"", I would have completely given up on any kind of animated film.  Thankfully, though, these two movies have restored my faith in cartoondom as a viable way of telling a story.  I agree with pretty much all of the positive comments I've heard thus far, so I'll omit the repetitive yammering and refute the claims of the more negative commentary on ""AntZ"".<br/><br/>Bad language?  The movie was rated PG.  The MPAA doesn't rate these movies just for their own amusement, folks.  If you don't want your kids to hear profane language, keep your moviegoing limited strictly to ""G"" films. Otherwise, don't blame DreamWorks because your five-year-old's favorite new word is ""damn"".  It's not their fault.  It's yours.  Pay attention to the MPAA rating next time.<br/><br/>Sexism? I read a comment claiming that ""AntZ"" sucked on account of the fact that the ""ant social structure"" was poorly portrayed: the males outnumbered the females, and the males ran everything.  If we're going to gripe about realism here, why not address the concept of talking ants (English, no less) that swing picks and wear WWII-style army helmets?  I vaguely recall having owned an ant farm, and they never formed big wrecking balls out of their own bodies.  Hence, realism is not an issue.<br/><br/>It's boring?  Okay, I can understand how a child could get bored while watching this film.  However, taking into account the fact that's a PG film, most people should've known that right off the bat.  This is a more cerebral film.  A thinking adult with even a high school education should appreciate the social implications made in the movie, and a film buff should howl at the vast number of movie references made in ""AntZ"".  If that's too much to handle, stick to mindless drivel like ""Dumb & Dumber"".<br/><br/>Woody Allen?  Damn right, Woody Allen.  Who could POSSIBLY better portray a neurotic ant in a colony of millions who feels that he is insignificant than him?<br/><br/>An ""ugly"" film?  Absolutely.  Lots of dark browns makes a lot more sense than Disney's baby blue hexapod, wouldn't you agree? Once again, this is a PG film, which means that people should have clued into the fact that it's not a ""family"" movie.  Being, as it is, a more ""adult-oriented"" film, it doesn't have to be all sunshine and rainbows. Why animate it at all, you ask? Especially in computer graphics?  (a) Do YOU think you could sit and watch an hour and a half of live actors dressed up in stupid-looking ant costumes?  (b) Computer animation offers unprecedented visual detail.<br/><br/>This concludes my tirade.  You may now resume perusing the comments."

There are some pretty violent scenes, including one very disturbing death and several mildly disturbing deaths, as well as an interrogation which leaves one character bruised and slightly bloodied.  I was surprised to find these elements in a film that I had thought was intended for children, then I realized that it was rated PG. Does no one make kids films for kids anymore?

"coffeyaddict","1","5","25","6 January 2004"," Anti-feminist nonsense
","This story makes no sense.  The story of the anthill has been completely perverted to suit the gender expectations of Hollywood generally, and in particular that of Pixar, a division of Lucasfilm.  It's not especially surprising that Lucasfilm has all these gender hang-ups, it's just really annoying. 	Antz is a very traditional story.  The princess realizes the error of her ways, is threatened by the bad guy, is saved by the hero, and plays a small role in saving her people.  But the movie isn't about her, it's about the underdog.  He is the one who has an idea, leads the adventure, uncovers the evil plot, leads the ants to victory and saves the day.  Oh yeah, and he gets the girl. 	In a real anthill, there are no heroes.  The collective is the hero. Individuals can't do anything.  The anthill is a poor metaphor for the power of free will.  It is the Queen who holds the power, such that it is, in an anthill.  There are no generals, no husbands.  The female leads the entire community.  The worker ants are female, the soldiers are usually female. The male ants are the small drones or princes, whose sole job is to mate with a princess, and fly away with her to start a new colony.  There is no way for a male to seize power; this is unheard of in the insect kingdom. <br/><br/>	Why was the anthill even chosen for this story?  Any truth about the anthill is immediately dispensed with.  The communistic tenets of the collective are discredited.  The power of the female is also tossed out the window.  The only remaining fact in this movie is that an ant can lift many times its own bodyweight.  Any kid that sees this film is going to get a very poor idea of what goes on in an anthill. 	So would I recommend this movie for kids?  No.  It's one long cliché, first of all.  It's also anti-feminist and the animation style is already dated, and not for the better.  There is serious product placement in the form of Pepsi products.  Basically, I couldn't find any redeeming qualities lurking in the shadows of this lame movie.  Skip it and rent Chicken Run."

","A minor point:  in ant colonies, males exist only to mate with the queen, then are discarded.  By human standards, they are literally sex slaves in a female-dominated society.  As for the movie, I count a whopping three females in the cast.  The hero, of course, is male.  Technically, ""Antz"" is the most sexist movie ever, implying the most highly successful species on Earth is run and operated by males, when the exact opposite is true.  Its critique of ant social structure is likewise so badly thought out that I wonder if the creators are illiterate.<br/><br/>And why not?  All the detail in ""Antz"" went straight to computer graphics, even though the cinematography is second-rate.  The voice actors are unskilled, the characters cardboard (even the spunky princess and bumbling hero give that ""been there done that"" feel), the humor bland, and the plot idiotic.  It's possible Hollywood simply abhors admitting to children that female-dominated societies can be successful, but it's more likely that the creators were too stupid to know and too apathetic to care.<br/><br/>Why are Americans so uneager to show children quality material?  If you want a good children's film, try ""My Neigbor Totoro"".  No CG, but plenty of beautifully detailed art and elegantly simple themes.  If you want wow-wow computer graphics or social critiques, ""Ghost in the Shell"" offers oh so much more, albeit not for kids.  ""Antz"" is cash-cow Hollywood."

Antz may be derivative of other movies but it worked in introducing audiences with CG-animation in cinema outside of PIXAR's Toy Story.

","Antz is a film directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson. I decided not to watch or read anything regarding this film before watching the film. After finally watching it, I can say that I enjoyed the whole 87 minutes of this film.<br/><br/>Plot: Z, a worker ant decides to impersonate as a soldier ant just to impress the Princess Bala.<br/><br/>Story and direction: The film released at a time when CGI animation was just starting. This film is also famous because of its similarities with A BUG'S LIFE. But let me tell you these two films are poles apart in terms of content. This film mainly focuses on the issue of making your own choices rather than just doing the things just because someone told you to. This theme is very relevant in modern times and it has been very clearly justified in the film. There are many adult references in the film which also made it very different considering at the time animated films were aimed for the children. Also, the designs for the characters are amazing. The voice work was aptly chosen. Finally, the music of the film was great and was like sugar to the ears. What I did have a problem with was the animation itself. Three years before this we had a film like Toy Story which is considered as a landmark in terms of animated CGI films. The animation was not impressive with this one, but I laud the effort that the makers went to in order to make this film. <br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the first interaction between Bala and Z and then the dance in the scene thereafter. This scene caught on to my mind because this particular scene justifies the basic theme of the film of doing something different than others so that you can be unique. <br/><br/>Verdict: Although I won't say that this is one of the best animated films of all time, but I do say that this film deserves a watch. With 87 minutes as the runtime, I did feel entertained for the whole time. I never felt for a moment that the film even diverted my attention, which is a huge credit for any film.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."
"classicsoncall","7","1","3","29 May 2018"," ""Don't worry. I know almost exactly what I'm doing.""
","I'm always late to these animated features, and didn't realize that ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"" were released within a month or so of each other. If forced to choose between the two, I'd say ""A Bug's Life"" is the better of the two movies, but both films have a good message at their core. Where ""A Bug's Life"" instilled the value of hard work and persevering for a common cause, ""Antz"" appears more ideologically positioned as a statement of individualism versus conformity, and if one were to extend the argument, of free enterprise versus socialism. I don't want to get too heavy in reviewing what's nominally a kid's film, but if youngsters can derive the message of thinking for one's self instead of relying on group-think or surrendering their freedom to a self proclaimed, 'smarter' or 'stronger' authority, then the film will have done it's service. <br/><br/>The one thing I've always wondered about with animated pictures is why the film makers call on such heavy duty celebrity talent to make them. The voice actors here included Woody Allen, Dan Aykroyd, Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez, and Anne Bancroft. Anne Bancroft - really!! Except for Woody Allen, I didn't recognize any of the other voice characterizations, and wouldn't know who they were if I hadn't checked the film credits. My point I guess, is that for a kid's movie, what youngster is going to know or care about who's supplying the voices. I can't see how appealing to an adult audience with name actors has anything to do with telling an effective story. And guess what, the picture can be made a whole lot cheaper relying on regular folks with distinctive voices, I mean, there are plenty enough of them around. I've made the same criticism of films like the 'Mummy' series from the 1930's and 40's - why have a name actor like Lon Chaney Jr. portray a character wrapped entirely in yards of cloth? Couldn't anyone do it at half the price?"

When Antz came out, Disney/Pixar's ' A Bug's Life' also mad a splash on the screen. If memory serves well, A Bug's Life was released first (which was also a fine movie), but unfortunately spoiled some of the would-be movie-goers who thought this was a rip-off of A Bug's Life. Too bad, because it's not. It's just chance I guess that two films came out months apart from each other, both dealing with ants. <br/><br/> Anyway, the all star voices, or in this case more of a computerized cast alone, makes this film worth watching, much less the clever surroundings, animation, and plot. 3.5/5 stars--<br/><br/>JOHN ULMER<br/><br/>BTW: Notice one of many cameos by Dan Akyroyd!

","Three years after the first full computer animated feature film, Toy Story, came out, came this charming and witty family adventure. Basically Z (a fantastic Woody Allen) is insecure, and feels insignificant among the other millions of ants in the colony. Meanwhile, Princess Bala (sexy sounding Sharon Stone) has a similar situation with the thought of replacing her Queen mother (Anne Bancroft), with the dastardly General Mandible (Gene Hackman) as her husband. One day she decides to get out into the workers world, and this is when Z and her meet in the bar, and he immediately has an attraction for her. He is desperate to see her again, and when he hears of a troop of soldiers that will meet the Queen, he asks he soldier friend Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) to take his place (and vice versa). He didn't realise they were going to war with giant acid-spraying termites, but after surviving, and watching his brief soldier friend Barbatus (Danny Glover) die, he gets back and sees Bala again. But after some arguments with General Mandible, Z and Bala are thrown down the garbage shoot and thrown into the outside world. But instead of going back to the palace, Z is eager to find the place a Drunk Scout (John Mahoney) told him about, Insectopia (from seeing what to look out for). Meanwhile, the General and his sidekick (turning nice) Colonel Cutter (Christopher Walken) are not just searching for Bala, but getting the workers to finish breaking through the underground (secretly) to drown them with the lake above. Also starring Dan Aykroyd as Chip the Wasp, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez as Azteca the worker, and Jane Curtin as Muffy the wasp. A Bug's Life may have had more people at the cinema, but this one certainly has more appeal with stars, wittiness and lovable characters, great family fun. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Outstanding!"

","Worker ant Z has issues - he feels insignificant and that he doesn't make a difference - and he's right.  As a worker ant he dreams of meeting the beautiful Princess Bala.  When he swaps places with Weaver, his military friend he becomes a hero in the termite war and goes on a search with Bala for Insectopia.  But with Bala gone, Sinister General Mandible has plans to take over the colony and wipe out all but the strongest ants, can Z be a hero again?<br/><br/>I'm very much a Woody Allen fan, so straight away I'm a fan of this type of comedy.  The story is good for a child's comedy and it would stand up by itself.  The story is full of movie references (the `Starship Troopers' termite wars being the best), and is interesting enough to keep adults interested.  For children there are enough good visuals, action scenes and visual jokes to keep them happy.  But what really makes this film stand out is Allen's voice work.  He brings his style of humour to the film and is the perfect choice for the ant suffering from feelings of worthlessness and insignificance.  So many of the lines will go over the heads of children, but it is great to have this level of wit and humour in a kids film.<br/><br/>The other thing that makes this stand out is the depth of the cast - and the fact that they are all good.  Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, John Mahoney, J-Lo, Sharon Stone (who Allen gave her first role to), and Sylvester Stallone (this is much better than the other Stone/Stallone feature `the Specialist').  The two other main roles are really well cast. Hackman is perfect as General Mandible while Walken is really well cast as Cutter - it's easy to see him in the animation.<br/><br/>Overall this is an excellent film for adults and children.  A Bug's Life may be better for children because of it's brighter animation and greater reliance on visual humour, however Antz is by far the superior film."

A Bug's Life was conceived before Antz. Antz shows more harsh and communist themes. Even in post 9/11, they forgot to replace the Two Towers with these stinking replacements in a future edition! Antz is not recommended for everybody. Antz should have been made in the first place. Good thing A Bug's Life won the success. Flik is essentially much better than Z.

","Released in 1998 and produced by DreamWorks, ""Antz"" is an animated adventure/comedy about a colony of ants where one of the workers named Z (voiced by Woody Allen) feels insignificant in a system of rigid conformity. He meets Bala (Sharon Stone) and they escape the colony to find the mythical ""Insectopia,"" which might not be the paradise they anticipated. Meanwhile, arrogant General Mandible (Gene Hackman) seeks to liquidate the lowly worker ants once they finish a mega-tunnel.<br/><br/>This is a solid animated flick with many chuckles, but I found the opening act rather dull. The story really picks up when Z and Bala discover the outside world and the myriad hazards thereof. The end reveal of where the colony is located made me bust out laughing.<br/><br/>Part of the fun of animated movies is trying to place the voices of the characters. Hackman was easy to figure out, as are Sylvester Stallone and Christopher Walken. Other actors who contributed include: Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, John Mahoney and Jim Cummings. <br/><br/>How does ""Antz"" compare to Pixar's ""A Bug's Life,"" which was released about the same time in late 1998? Generally speaking, ""Antz"" is more adult-oriented and darker while ""A Bug's Life"" is more family-oriented and colorful.

The other characters were pretty one-dimensional. There was also some sexual remarks such as Z saying that the princess would no longer be a part of his ""erotic fantasies.""

","Like how Pixar started off strong with Toy Story, DreamWorks also has a film that cranked their engine up nicely, its called Antz. It is a film that not only has a great story, animation, and characters, but one that belongs with the legends of animated films. After this, DreamWorks would shortly become Disney's greatest competitor. And this would only be the first of many successes in DreamWorks' lineup. Now let talk about what made this so great. First the story is very realistic. And the way the ants work actually seem like what they would actually be. The ants all look different, making them all easily recognizable. And the animation although dated, looks impressive for a first time animated studio. I'd say the animation is on par with Toy Story. Of course no film is perfect. The negatives are that although the story is realistic it does have many similarities to A Bug's Life. I know the whole story involving Disney and Katzenburg but don't get me started on that. The film did come out before A Bug's Life meaning that maybe A Bug's Life is the least creative. So with that said, Antz is the more original film. There however isn't much else to gripe about and the animation is just a nitpick, in 1998 it does look very impressive. Luckily, unlike Don Bluth, Amblimation, and Fox Animation, DreamWorks managed to stay for a long time to come. Antz helped to kick off one of the best companies working today. Now to grade.

"sundaresh-a","1","0","7","18 May 2015"," Ants, Bee movie, Conspiracy theories and Aliens
","I was one to dismiss all conspiracy theorists as paranoid and their conspiracy theories themselves as unfounded eyewash, till seeing these two movies confirmed what I long suspected and deep down always expected. All said and done, a crow cannot sing like a cuckoo.<br/><br/>Ever come across an ant that made its own meal and not steal it or come across a bee that drank its own nectar. Ever seen a selfish bee or a selfless ant. The only bees I have seen that didn't make any honey were in Bee movie and the only ants I have seen that didn't help themselves but help others were in Antz. It is not for nothing that ants carry more than their own weight. The number one killers on land are African army ants whose war path one had better not cross when they go on a binge or feeding spree. Their scourge is on land what the feeding frenzy of shoal's of vicious fish is on water. On the other hand, all one needs to do to not be stung by a bee is to not disturb it. The Guinness records, Ripley's believe it or not, and such other shows featuring daring human feats are a testament to this fact. One who has to smoke the hive and/or invade it to evict the bee to steal its honey is certainly a thief. I have always maintained that the only one worthy of the silk is the worm that makes it. It is the only thing more precious and more priceless than the silk itself. The only one worthy of the honey is the bee which produces it. It is the only thing more precious than the honey itself. The only one worthy of the nest, is the bird which builds it. It is the only thing more precious than the nest itself. The only one worthy of the web is the spider which spins it. It is the only thing more sinister than the web itself. And here is the good news of the gospel. The only one worthy of the truth is the one who tells it. For being the humble steward and the servant of the truth, and for upholding it, that one is certainly more precious than the truth itself. One can never hope to better the standard by always lowering it, yet always going under it and always falling short of it.<br/><br/>Clearly, these movies are directed towards an innocent and infantile audience, readily trusting, easily impressionable, with tremendous grasping power. Do they need to be fed such a lopsided and perverted truth at this young age ? They will take it to heart and passionately consume it and eventually be consumed by it.<br/><br/>What is it, if not a conspiracy theory to suggest that one must not eat of the fruit of the tree of good and evil; that to discriminate between good and evil, between right and wrong, is in-fact not good but evil ? What is it if not a deep-seated conspiracy and lie to suggest that being good is neither important nor necessary nor required, to go to heaven, and the criteria for getting to heaven is to just believe in God, not even to believe in being, much less in actually being good ? What is it if not a conspiracy to suggest that God can forgive all the banalities and sins of the evil people and welcome them into his heaven, but cannot forgive the one sin of the good people of not believing in him ? <br/><br/>What was eden, if not a garden and I am sure that it was not a lawn, or a portico, or a terrace, or a hanging, or a bonsai, garden ? What did the Lord and the son refer to himself as, but the true-vine and refer to his father as, but the gardener ? In all my life I have never come across a dead vegetable or a live wire. I have never tasted junk and unhealthy food, or swallowed nutritious and healthy medicine. There are no such things. What is it if not an out and out seditious and subversive conspiracy theory to suggest that a little evil is good but a lot of good is evil; that a little poison makes it elixir and a lot of elixir makes it poison, upon which a malicious system of medicine is founded ? Just how much poison in solid food will actually make it better and not contaminate it. What if this contaminant was slyly introduced into the food product as a chemical preservative or as a false nutritive or as an additive of some sort, or into the food cycle itself as a chemical pesticide, or even artificial manure ? Does not a drop of poison in drink make the whole drink poisonous ? The dispersion is least in solids, more rapid in liquids, and a lot more pronounced in gases. What sort of poisonous gases emerge and emanate from the breath of smokers and from the exhaust fumes of vehicles ? That fossil fuel is not even good for the very machine and engine that it drives and will rapidly wear out that engine and deteriorate that contraption. BTW, if you are wondering, where did all this prodigious underground reserves of fuel come from and at the same time are also wondering what happened to all the Dinosaurs, now you know. The plain fact of the matter is that one can never have too much of what is good nor have too little of what is evil.<br/><br/>What is it, if not a conspiracy theory to project false values in movies, all of which glamorize and glorify the unjust and the evil, and denigrate the just and the good, these ones included ?<br/><br/>Does one have to scope and scout the universe to detect aliens ? Do they not dwell among us ?"

"Anonymous_Maxine","8","0","1","1 May 2008"," Smarter than A Bug's Life but not quite as fun.
","I always love a good animated film or TV show that can entertain both children and adults, like Toy Story or Shrek or The Simpsons, and while Antz is definitely aimed at pleasing both its older and younger audience members, there is something about it that is not quite as fun as its animated counterpart. There were numerous movies that were released seemingly in pairs around the same time as Antz and A Bug's Life were released, with one of them being better or more successful than the other, and it's clear to me that A Bug's Life is the superior film in this case. Antz, however, is certainly brilliantly written (like a lot of Woody Allen's best work), but unfortunately the film is not as versatile as I imagine was hoped.<br/><br/>Part of the problem may just be that Woody Allen is so recognizable. From the second Z starts talking Allen's neurotic, spectacled face jumps off the screen at you as if he were really there, waving his arms frantically. But his character is given great lines and there is certainly a lot of charming characters. I am reminded of some other ""animated"" films in which the characters look and act like the actors doing their voices, like The Polar Express or the recent and highly disappointing A Scanner Darkly. Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, and Danny Glover all star as their animated selves, and this is one of the movie's charms.<br/><br/>The story, however, and especially the message, is amazing in its importance and clever delivery. We are introduced to a colony of ants that all mindlessly go about their age-old jobs supporting the hive, when suddenly one of them breaches that line that separates humans from animals, he starts thinking for himself. He begins to lament that his own personal needs are overlooked completely as he does everything to support the colony. There is a charming scene where all of the ants are dancing at a cleverly designed insect bar, and while they all dance in an insect-like unison, Z decides he's had enough of the conformity and cuts loose on the dance floor. He immediately charms the beautiful (as beautiful as an insect can get, I guess) and engaged Princess Bala, who is immediately drawn to his sense of freedom and individuality. <br/><br/>There are a couple of militaristic ants, perfectly named General Mandible and Colonel Cutter and played by Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken, who are obsessed with the defense of the colony and want to divert all resources to the build up of the military. They even give the queen false reports of an impending invasion of the far superior termites in order to convince the queen that they must act before its too late.<br/><br/>Lately I have been learning a lot about Chinese history, and this is astonishing in the similarity to the way Mao Tse-tung deliberately inflated the possibility of an impending American invasion of China so that he could convince Stalin to give him the resources and expertise needed to build a nuclear bomb. Or the way he would commonly instigate action from Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang so that he could make a massacre look like self- defense. Thankfully, when it happens in Antz it is much less scary!<br/><br/>The movie is filled with stunning visual sequences, many of them brilliantly inspired by the real lives of ants, with others that are clearly wild, but fun, flights of fancy .The animation is incredible and the script is intelligent, although there is just a tiny bit of Allen's unique style of comedy that doesn't fit very smoothly into an animated film, particularly one aimed mostly at adults. In a lot of ways, however, it does work. When praised for laughing in the face of death, Z comments in true Woody Allen form, ""Actually I stand behind Death and make belittling comments at its back.""<br/><br/>There is a noted absence of cute showtoons and cloying romance in the movie, which even features a surprising amount of battle violence, a lot of which may very well put off some of the movie's youngest audience members. But it's also revealing about some of the unique physical characteristics of ants, like the one about how dismemberment may not quite kill them, but not the one about how it's almost literally impossible to drown ants. They can live for weeks underwater, but are given a human-like need for oxygen for the benefit of the plot.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is a fun romp into the world outside the colony, and our heroes are clearly unprepared. There are some clever and brilliant things that happen to Z and Princess Bala, like getting stuck in a piece of gum of the bottom of a shoe on their search for ""Insectopia,"" a picnic.<br/><br/>But the most important thing about the movie is the message. It's not about being yourself, but about not being the same as everyone else. After Z's brief military experience, he potently remembers a life-changing piece of advice given to him there.<br/><br/>""Don't follow orders for the rest of your life."""

","I can't say for sure how many times I've seen this film... and perhaps ""seen"" is the wrong term. I watched it a few times, and from then on, it became kind of ""background noise"". One belonging in a select group consisting of movies that I kinda-sorta like... but I cannot put upon myself to sit through all of, so I simply put it on to listen to while I do other things... and occasionally glance at. Some of these films I've seen too many times, some I just only really like scenes of... not sure which one this is. Possibly both. Anyway, having had it on as background noise for so long, I, again, couldn't fully agree with the idea of watching it. Not truly watching it. Not sitting down and concentrating on it. Still, I gathered enough to comment on the film as a whole. Something I realized was that the basic plot and the way it develops never truly stuck with me... something unusual for the background noise movies. Usually, that is only the case with movies I've watched once or twice and decided was just too bad to give one more chance... even as background noise. And even then, it's a seldom occurrence. But it's the case with this one. I simply can't recall it from one ""viewing"" to another. Something that truly surprised me upon this time(since I have far more politically and socially aware since the last time I watched it) was the message and how much of the film it really takes up. And I also kind of noticed... this is not a pleasant film. This is not for children. I kid you not, I can think of teenagers who would be frightened by the ideas put forth by this movie(mind you, rather ignorant and easily affected teenagers, but still). This is a movie that very strongly advertises individualism and opposes totalitarianism... views that I can only agree with this films opinion on, but here, they just seem painfully heavy-handedly presented here. Not much room for free thought(ironic, since that is the very thing the film advocates) about the subject. The plot is fair. The acting is nice, and the actors all play characters reminiscent of what they often, if not usually, play... which makes for some entertainment for those of us old enough to know them. Again, this is really not a family/children's film. The humor is decent enough... however, half of it is for those too young to see it, the other half is for those of us who are old enough to know everything it tells us and who will most likely find it too simple. The animation is dated, and has been pretty much(at the very least) since the film came out. The soundtrack is fair, with a few decent tunes. Doris Day performs the credits song, one so insipid and daft and yet annoyingly catchy, you find yourself humming it and being irritated at the discovery. All in all, there's just not anything to watch this film for... except for the admittedly good references to other frequent roles of the cast. I recommend this to big fans of the actors and virtually no one else. 6/10"
"gelman@attglobal.net","5","0","1","13 November 2005"," NOT for adults; TOLERABLE for adults with children
","Whoever originally spread the myth that ANTZ is a film that can be enjoyed by adults as well as children must have been an adult with children. And that much is true: If you've got kids under 10, this is good ""family entertainment."" It is a notch above almost anything Disney has ever produced, and it is not likely to cause the parents to wish immediately that they were somewhere else -- any place else. If, however, adults seeing it without children in tow are not likely to be impressed. The story line is typical of almost every feature length cartoon you've ever seen and a good many fairy tales: high born/low born romance, an arch-villain, heroine (and hero, in this case) tied metaphorically to the railroad tracks, creature solidarity, last minute rescue from disaster, comeuppance for the villain. The best thing that ANTZ has doing for it is Woody Allen's voice and an insect variation on his persona as a neurotic, love-struck little sh nook. Surprisingly (to me at least), I did not really recognize the voices of the other well-known stars who also spoke the dialog of other characters in this animated film. Without their faces and bodies, Sharon Stone, Anne Bancroft, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez and Christopher Walken could easily have been replaced by other actors, and I wouldn't have known the difference. If you've got kids the right age, this is a very tolerable film. If you're not watching it with little kids, watch something else."

","""Antz"" is one of those movies that perhaps won't stick with us forever, but is still memorable and thought-provoking. Despite how it was promoted, this is not a children's movie. First of all, the swearing is a little too much for a child, and there are some pretty graphic sequences. Secondly, though this is nothing against the movie, the themes are too deep for a child to truly comprehend. A better kid's film about insects is ""A Bug's Life"" (which is also a fantastic movie). The anti-communistic motives and themes of individuality are well presented, and the voice acting is superb (Allen as the puny Z presents a perfectly whiny voice, that fits his character to a tee.) The menacing General Mandibly and his henchman, Cutter, are perfectly crafted by their respective voice actors. The overall plot is also terrific, and for what was to be a children's film, the termite v. ant battle is spectacularly done- very exciting. The overall idea of a lowly worker becoming a leader of his people has been done many times, and ""Antz"" sticks with a tried and true notion. If you can see the true ideas behind the cutesy insect animation, you wont be disappointed with ""Antz."""

","This movie was wonderful. Yes, it looks great, has a great voice cast and great characters and a sweet love story, but next to all that this movie actually has something to say. When I sat down tonight to watch this on TV I expected to watch a funny, not so deep, easy movie, so I was surprised by the deeper meaning of it.<br/><br/>The story is about the ant Z, who is a worker in a colony. He is very depressed and has the feeling that there has to be more to life than his boring job. When he meets princess Bala in a bar he immediately falls head over heals in love with her. Because of this love he is switching with his friend Weaver a soldier, so he can meet the princess again. But things start to go wrong when he ends up in a heavy battle and returns from it as the only survivor and hero. The story goes on as Z ""accidently"" kidnaps Bala and together they have several adventures, before the spectacular end scene.<br/><br/>This movie is about choices, about equality, about standing up for what you believe in. The plan of the main villain, the general, has very obvious references to WW2 and Hitler. Also the references to 1984, the famous George Orwell novel, are very present. This movie has it all.<br/><br/>But Antz is also still a movie for kids. This is what makes this movie so great for everyone to watch. Small kids (but not to small I think) could enjoy this for the visuals, it's adventure and it's humor, while the parents could enjoy this movie on a deeper level.<br/><br/>All in all, I would highly recommend this movie for everybody above the age of eight."

","This animated film by Dreamworks is very funny and is fantastic! It has an all-star cast which includes Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Woody Allen, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, and Dan Akroyd! All of the actors play their characters well and it is something else how these actors bring such much life and personality to these wonderful characters! I thought it was amazing that Curtin and Akroyd was a couple again! The animation is really incredible and I was amazed by the termite wars and the ant army marching scenes! They are so cool! The color is really clean and crisp and not to mention very clear. The story is very good and each and every character has their own personality. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell is very good as well. If you love the cast mentioned above and animated films that are hilarious then I strongly recommend then you check out Ants today!"

Instead, I'd like to comment on the double pun (or perhaps just a triple meaning) within the title itself.<br/><br/>""Antz"" can be looked at in three ways: a cute misspelling of the plural of ""Ant""; a statement of the name of the protagonist, ""Ant Z""; and a description of how he felt about his place in society, ""Ant-z"" (antsy).<br/><br/>I don't know that the writers meant this, but it seems too improbable to be just a coincidence.

"lizziebeth-1","10","0","1","1 May 2003"," How to reorganize a Marxist superorganism from the inside. 9/10. Spoilers.
","Animation has become the last vestige of grand storytelling for filmmakers. In its rush to satisfy the growing legions of ADD-sufferers (dismissive audiences with short attention spans), live action may have lost the battle to take its time. Nothing is `real' to us anymore, especially not the `reality shows' that cheat and corrupt their way through the use-and-abuse of idiots hoping for their 15mins of fame. Frankly, this is what postmodernism really gets us.<br/><br/>Substance (mental infrastructure) is being missed. Even adults need substantive messages, but their suspicions over who's doing the telling have allowed them to reject everything, throwing  the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. That's postmodernism, the rejection of past perceptions. However, postmodernism has to insist that there IS no baby, and I have to argue that's going too far (it's one tiny step away from nihilism). So now I have a saying: Inclusivity is the baby--postmodernism is the bathwater.<br/><br/>The full deconstruction of everything society achieved in the past to start again from scratch, nihilism, is what General Mandible(Gene Hackman), the dictator of Antz(1998) wants to pursue, despite his ant-society's otherwise well-oiled albeit hierarchical (repressive) machine. Equating an ant colony with caste-system human societies now seems obvious; although ants have long been used as metaphors for human foibles/societal ills ever since the Greek slave Aesop won his freedom by entertaining nobles with his fables in the 6thC BC (A Bug's Life(1998) was developed from Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper).<br/><br/>Obviously, the strength of this `kids' film' lies in the story. As the directors say, their movie is about an ant world, it's not a dime-a-dozen story about some hero.<br/><br/>There's so much petty injustice in Antz society that, not surprisingly, they turn to a Marxist model (a hierarchy easily accommodating their pre-existing caste system). The worker-ants' cry of `It's the workers who control the means of production' now sounds like a Pythonesque pi**take of Karl Marx. The mantra is correct, but it's just so anachronistic!<br/><br/>Antz's canny political plot is related through a neurotic uber-individualist ant, Z(Woody Allen). Z and the plot so thoroughly cover the bases of an individualist manifesto that much of Woody's real-life career wind has been taken out of his sails. Antz(1998) single-handedly expresses most of Woody's lifelong concerns by giving him the platform to be his own purist. This may account for his subsequent career-lows Smalltime Crooks(2000) and Hollywood Ending(2002). In fact, Antz(1998) is a partial remake of Woody's Play It Again Sam(1972), and of It Happened One Night(1934) for the roadtrip segment.<br/><br/>Antz's `original' charm is undeniable. It's full of ironic/cutesy normalizations of rather terrifying ant-behaviour into our human sphere--eg the ants' regimented dancing, aphid-butt beers, flying insects representing higher social class, and insects that talk back after decapitation.<br/><br/>The funniest scene comes during Weaver(Sylvester Stallone)'s nervous midnight argument with Z: `Do you know how much trouble you can get into just for listening to someone trying to impersonate a soldier?!' -causing rubbernecking ants in the surrounding sleeping quarters to slam their heads back down.<br/><br/>I also loved Guantanamera, deconstructed as both uber-elevator-music, as well as a theme for Z's romantic interludes.<br/><br/>Mandible wouldn't be much of a threat if he didn't covet wars, so Antz doesn't look half bad as a war movie/ripoff of Starship Troopers(1997). The crucial depiction of Barbatus (a very tender Danny Glover) dying on the battlefield powerfully reminds us of the brutality of war. Barbatus became the most-liked character with child-age audiences (and me!).<br/><br/>Of course it's the generals who plan the wars, but it's the troops (or `troop')--and civilians in the middle--who get killed. Actually, harming civilians is necessarily more despicable, not only because soldiers have better protection, but because `collateral damage' makes logical justification for war that much more elusive. That's always been the case.<br/><br/>At best, war is conducted with smart bombs programmed by dumb intelligence. At worst, war is pointless man-made disaster, the outcomes of which then start off a new cycle of tit-for-tat on top of old, unsettled tit-for-tat. Warfare, except as a last resort, was opposed by no lesser a satirist than Francois Rabelais back in 1534 (Gargantua's speech). We don't need warfare, or their apologists, 500yrs later!<br/><br/>In Antz, Gen.`Man-Deeb-lay' sends his troops--those who are loyal to his queen instead of him--on a suicide mission. It's on this issue that I fault Darnell & Johnson, for never explaining what drove the General--he just seems to crave a colony without `incompetent' workers. Worse, we have no backstory for Col.Cutter(Christopher Walken)'s  `fearsome' reputation (he'd been redesigned from just an assassin sidekick to Mandible). All this leaves a lotta plot holes.<br/><br/>However, my favourite scene shows Gen.Mandible in a simply stunning piece of spindoctoring. Although we don't know what drives him (other than putated madness), we see he's an old hand at Orwellian doublespeak worthy of any Hitler/Stalin. It's frightening how speedily he turns a hostile crowd by augmenting and reinterpreting holes in their knowledge; highlighting how easy it is to brainwash people who aren't able to cross-check the information they're fed by their unimpeachable authorities.<br/><br/>Eric Darnell & Tim Johnson's technique of changing the story as new ideas arose from animators' improved techniques is probably responsible for this ant-world-movie being generally preferred to Disney's schmaltzier effort the same year (A Bug's Life). Although the 3yr-long revisions exhausted writers Todd Alcott + Chris & Paul Weitz, they allowed the story to incorporate homage touches to other movies, a practice well-established by PDI's Shrek(2001).<br/><br/>PDI's Antz(1998) also resurrects Stallone's comedy reputation after my beloved Oscar(1991). Stallone's ant soldier Weaver is a perfectly well-adjusted tough-as-nails softie. Weaver was given exactly the right amount of screentime for us to grow very fond of him, unlike J-Lo, who plays Azteca merely prototypically.<br/><br/>SPOILER:-------------------------------------------------------------- The proverbial happy ending rankles a bit for those of us who expected more philosophical debate; but the final message that all dictators must be resisted is good enough for anybody.(9/10)"

"kenobe","6","0","2","25 October 1998"," A humorous piece of Communist propaganda
","While it is a fairly humorous film, Antz relies too heavily on Woody Allen's magnificent talent. Although not written by Allen, his dialogue resembles that found in classics such as Annie Hall, etc. His sharp wit carries a movie that is otherwise lackluster and dull.<br/><br/>The movie, unfortunately, has a rather deficient plot. It is merely a poorly constructed communist diatribe masquerading as a fun, family film.<br/><br/>Allen's character, Z, is thrust into the role of Marxist leader after accidentally kidnapping the Queen's daughter, who is, for some reason, engaged to an ant general. The writers, while trying to create a realistic ant colony atmosphere, seem to have forgotton that queen ants' larva are fertilized by many male ants, and have no meaningful relationship with any one.<br/><br/>It is decided that Z is a great leader, because he refuses to accept his role as a worker. It seems that the ant rulers are horrible, oppressive autocrats who have enslaved the entire colony, imposing their will upon the voiceless workers. Phrases such as ""the workers control the means of production"" are uttered as the ant colony tries to expel the evil General.<br/><br/>Z repeatedly declares that is is essential for ants to be allowed to think individually, and that an ant's status ought not be determined at birth.<br/><br/>Eventually, of course, the workers triumph over the evil General, and a just society is supposely established. Ironically, they achieve their sovereignty by forming a large ladder, comprised of unidentifiably, generic ants. In the end we see the great ant colony, in which individuality is prized and freedom prevails. It is merely a faceless mass, an undistinct cluster of undifferentiable insects.<br/><br/>Woody Allen shines in this movie, but it is truly a one man (or one ant) show. Go for the humor, but do not expect anything more."
"Cntnuous","9","0","1","14 October 1998"," An animated Ayn Rand novel!
","An exceptional movie that reminds one of an Ayn Rand novel - especially Atlas Shrugged.  It's a story of the triumph of ""I"" over the collective ""we"".  The unlikely hero is an ant named Z who isn't particularly good at anything other than dreaming and thinking...on his own.<br/><br/>Philosophy aside, this movie should be well received by adults and children alike.  There's enough visual excitement to keep the kids in their seats and enough plot and dialogue to keep the adults interested.  Adults will be more prone to leave the film profoundly impacted, however.  The Libertarian party should take the opportunity to set up registration tables outside every theater playing Antz!<br/><br/>On a technical note, this film doesn't look to be nearly as advanced as Pixar's upcoming ""A Bug's Life"".  While Antz' achievements are still dazzling, they are no where near as sophisticated as what Pixar is putting out.  Antz is a lesson in the color brown, while A Bug's Life looks to be a rainbow of incredibly fine detail.  But, honestly, this doesn't matter a whole heck of a lot - people see movies for the story.  These excellent characters could have been hand-drawn stick figures and the film would have still played well."

"Covey-3","Null","0","1","23 May 2000"," The Antz are Back in Town
","In the wake of Toy Story, computer animation had a new path open to explore, the only problem was, making a film better than Toy Story. The charm of the characters and the simplicity of the story made it a film that could not only be enjoyed by children but by adults too. This is where Antz comes in. While Toy Story only existed on the one level that could be enjoyed by all, Antz exists on two levels, one level that can be enjoyed by children, aswell as a completely different level that can be enjoyed by adults. While only one of these levels may be universally transcendent, it does not take away from the overall enjoyment of this film.<br/><br/>On the first level is a simple story. Hitchcockian simplicity placing an ordinary character in an extraordinary situation, sees ordinary Ant worker Z foiling General Mandible's evil plans to take over the ant colony and getting the girl, Princess Bala. On a more adult level are the subtle movie references that range from the dance sequence inspired by Pulp Fiction, to the war sequence inspired by both Starship Troopers and The Killing Fields. Perhaps the best way to read this movie, however, is as a self referential gag fest about Woody Allen. As it is Allen who voices the main character Z, one can only assume that he knows that his character Z is an utter send up of his on and off screen persona. Any opening scene that borrows from Manhattan but is actually a decent from silhouetted grass stems into a psychiatrists room, where Z is telling his psychiatrist of how he feels inadequate and a nobody is totally sublime. The fact that the reply from the psychiatrist that he is a nobody also makes you wonder if this is more than just a cartoon and more of a social commentary on communism and capitalism. By the end of the film we realise that the capitalist ideal has won over the communist ideal first seen in the opening sequence where every ant knows its place and is working for the colony. This contrast between capitalism and communism continues as a motif throughout the film.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film contain all the elements that one desires on a film but Antz is different, combining the politics of war, the cross class love affair, the down and out looking for inspiration and a reason to carry on and most importantly, a story about humanity and the human condition. Beneath the surface of Antz lies the struggle of an ordinary Ant who wants something more and fights, albeit quite humorously, for his place and fights to be a better ant (read person). One touching scene has Z and his new friend Barbados meeting for a final time after the battle. Barbados, now being only a head, asks Z how bad it is. Touching and charming this is what the film is all about.<br/><br/>Another welcome idea in the film is the casting of two former A-list stars who have 0more or less become B-list stars, in the form of Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. Both give underestimated performances as Z's buddy Weaver and Princess Bala respectively. Gene Hackman mirrors his tights and ruthless performance in Crimson Tide as General Mandabal and Christopher Walken is also at his usual best as Cutter. It is however Woody Allen who makes this film his own. The send up of himself as the neurotic ant who is trying to find a better place and a better life until he realises that he already has it has a knowing warmth and charm to it. <br/><br/>Comparisons with Toy Story, A Bugs Life and even Toy Story 2 will always detract from just how good a film this is and in fact is probably the only criticism one can find with the film. Toy Story had the novelty of being the first, A Bugs Life had the plain simplicity of story and entertainment, Toy Story 2 had a previous fan base, already known characters and a better story than its predecessor. Antz however has everything, drawing together, aside from the familiarity of the sequel, all of the different elements that made the others good, aswell as adding a few elements to a fastly growing genre of digitally animated, clever, cartoons."

In a world where rich colorful 3-D animation surrounds the imagination, ANTZ is marvelous at this surrealistic reality. This may be the next step in animated movies. Nevertheless, the water bubble and the boy's gum-shoe are two reasons to go see this. The celebrity voices including Woody Allen and Sharon Stone add the sparkles, giving this the splendor of Hollywood magic. Unfortunately, young kids may not take ANTZ too seriously, and with the unexpected mild language and violence, they're better off watching TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE for some light-hearted fun. Your kids will be bored and sleepy-headed because this aims at a much older crowd, which took me by surprise. The brilliant wonder of computer animation should be attractive fun for virtually everyone, and until we notice the movie feeling so casual and hard-heavy, it's too far away from being a ""G""-rated show. It's not what it should be, and it lacks the magically spirited punch of Disney, but ANTZ is fine testimony in transforming hand-drawn art to polygons. The competition between this one and A BUG'S LIFE is going to be very stiff. Expect Disney / Pixar to win the title, or at least they have already. That film I'll comment on later."
