","If you listen to a lot of the comments on this site you will probably never want to see this movie and that would be a shame because it is probably one of the best movies of the last couple of years. The thing I like most about this movie is that it transports you back to that glorious time in 70's Venice and that's what a good movie does. Granted, if I were to dig deeper into the facts of the Zephyr team I probably wouldn't like the movie as much because it wouldn't be ""factual."" What I have come to find out is that most movies that are based on a true story always distort the facts but that is irrelevant. This is still a movie, not a documentary. The purpose here is to entertain. I remember Roger Ebert gave ""JFK"" a great review and Walter Konkrite ripped him for it saying the events depicted were not fact based. Ebert responded by saying that the movie captured the nation's collective fears, paranoia, and cynicism about the government since the assassination and that's what a movie is supposed to do. I love the use of music in this movie and how the character's all have to come to grips in their own ways with their new found stardom. The ending is also very emotional and almost poetic. Overall, a fun, nostalgic glimpse into some of the skater's lives and what they did for their sport."
"smurf_is_sxc","8","51","59","22 September 2006"," Lords Of Dogtown
","Although there has been much controversy about whether the movie has really portrayed 'Dogtown' and the z-boys accurately, i feel this is not even necessary. If you feel unsatisfied with what you have learnt about the z-boys and Dogtown go and watch Peralta's documentary Dogtown and Z-boys. Lords of Dogtown has the intention of entertainment and i personally exetremely enjoyed it. Lords of Dogtown tells the story of how a group of Venice street kids changed the face of skateboarding (and, to some degree, youth) culture in the mid- to late 1970s. The adolescent adopted the Zephyr Shop, a surf store run by Skip Engblom (Heath Ledger), as their home away from the own dysfunctional homes. Engblom recruited the best skaters for the Zephyr Team. Including: Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), responsible Stacy Peralta (John Robinson) and troubled bad-boy innovator Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch). With the introduction of urethane wheels (revolutionary for the boys skating style as now the wheels gripped, they could ""climb walls"")and the timely South Cal drought meaning swimming pools were to be emptied, giving the boys perfect locations to practice their gravity-defying maneuvers, Zephyr became the be-all-end-all of the skateboarding scene.<br/><br/>""Lords of Dogtown"" follows the rise and inevitable fall of the team, efficiently conveying the events with a flat accuracy that emphasizes history over character development. Director Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") does an outstanding job of re-creating the seedy '70s atmosphere so much so that you could be forgiven for assuming you were watching archival outtakes from ""Z-Boys."" Hardwicke really nails that sense of post-Vietnam, rejection of authority of SoCal.<br/><br/>Hardwicke also understands the thrilling nature of speed for these kids. She employs a point-of-view camera from a skateboard's wheel to convey the rush. Hardwicke's most important achievement, however, was how she portrayed that skating was indeed these boys life. You really could see how skating for character Jay Adams was an outlet for the psychological pain he was experiencing. Hardwicke was very devoted to her character's individual portrayals. She has 3 contrasting personalities of main characters and shows this also through camera techniques. Jay being the more kinesthetic, hard, ""go-go-go"" character has many hand held shots and the zoom is employed more, creating a rough, jerky portrayal. Stacey Peralta being the strangely responsible one with a job has straight on, clean cut shots. Tony Alva, however, our most competitive Z-boy by far is filmed often from below, giving him a larger than life presence. <br/><br/>The movie was composed exceptionally and not too 'Hollywood' ( that is focusing on unrealistic character relations and excruciatingly social-analytical). It moved just fast enough to stop you from being potentially bored by the many skating scenes if you did not fit that demographic. However, even there i felt Hardwicke handled this amazingly too. I have never thought in my life i would ever watch a skating movie but i simply adored this one. Character relations were conveyed so realistically. The boys relationships were almost to real, you could feel the unspoken tension between them as the Zephyr team starts to go their separate ways. Hardwicke shows that true, stereotypical male bonding, that is that their love of skateboarding in the end is what brings them together. <br/><br/>Featuring a great soundtrack - including much Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie and the classic Wish You Were Here, i gave this movie a real thumbs up."
"zephyrforever75","10","18","20","12 January 2009"," This film is NOT for everyone
","I will start out by saying that I really do love this movie, but I'm not here to rant and rave about it. This movie is fascinating to me because I do love the skate culture and seeing a movie about characters who started modern skating was, as I said, fascinating. However, I realize that most of the world doesn't think that. With that in mind, I will continue. This movie is not a documentary about skating!!! If you want a documentary then check out Dogtown and Z-Boys directed by a Z-boy himself. It is full of stories about how the Zephyr team came to be and the way life was in Venice Beach at the time. I personally love the documentary as well, but Lords of Dogtown is not meant to be a Hollywood representation of the documentary. If you are looking for that, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Lords of Dogtown is meant to be a story about the characters that fills in the gaps the documentary leaves about how these people felt, mainly Jay Adams, Stacy Peralta, and Tony Alva. The camera angles are not straightforward, the cinematography is rough, and its not a cookie cutter film. But that, in my opinion, is why it works so well. A lot of the Z-Boys themselves were on staff for this movie and helped to make it as authentic as it could be while still holding the attention of movie-goers. These guys were very impressed with the way the film was produced and, for the most part, were very pleased with how it represented the time. If you love skate culture then chances are you will fall in love with this movie like I did. Even my parents, who are definitely not into the skate culture or the 70's, still enjoyed this movie and were interested about the documentary afterwards. This movie definitely made me more interested in what skating was all about and I can't get enough about these guys now. I highly recommend this movie as well as Dogtown and Z-Boys."

","I grew up in California and this movie REALLY brought me back to the 70's and what was happening in the skateboard world. The actors were totally on mark with their portrayals of these guys and how things were back then in California at that time. I'm a girl and I was into skateboarding at that time. I saved my own money to buy my own boards. I even remember my mom came home one day and gave me an article from a magazine about Alva. I met him later in the 80's and he's a very down to earth guy. If you grew up in Cali at this time, you will LOVE this movie and if you didn't you will get the true idea of what it was like then. Awesome job guys on this film! A definite classic!"
"BeLyt","8","23","30","28 January 2008"," Good by Ledger
","This was a great movie on friendship in the '70's, and a look at how the sport of skateboarding took off. I'd wanted to see it for awhile, so with Heath Ledger's death, didn't hesitate anymore. I didn't recognize him as the surf shop owner Skip, for the first several scenes. I think he added poignancy to his role, as did others who, in the film, fought their way to who they are. Interesting to know this is based on lives of people still in the skateboarding business, including the man who started off Tony Hawks career. It's good to have work out there yet to see Heath Ledger's talent shine. I'd recommend this movie to people who like to observe people, even if you're neither a skateboarding fan or a Ledger fan."

","Prior to the Z Boys skateboarding team in the Dogtown part of Santa Monica it wasn't even considered a sport with most of the tricks being more related towards gymnastics. The Z Boys one of the first teams to use polyurethane wheels which allowed them to take their skateboarding to a whole other level then anyone else. They were able to make skateboarding into more of a fast paced and daredevil artform that it's today. Being able to stay on their boards on more types of terrain then ever before. They invented skating empty swimming pools which eventually lead to vert skating being invented. All of the skateboarders of the 1980's like Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi, Mike McGill, Lance Mountain and s on wouldn't have been able to do what they did if it wasn't for Stacy Peralta, Jay Adams and Tony Alva. They were truly the forefathers of modern skateboarding."
"kc1177","8","28","39","3 July 2006"," You'll appreciate the movie more if you watch Peralta's documentary Dogtown and Z-boys.
","It was the seventies Sam. Materialism was making a comeback. For poor kids this was a way out of the dead end they saw in their future, so many of them jumped at the chance for a corporate sponsor. Watch the documentary. These were real people. Most of the events happened in some fashion to the team members, but to make it a more cohesive story, Peralta put it into one year and focused on the three main characters for the movie. Put the Dogtown and Z-boys documentary on and watch for how well they all match the mannerisms of the real people they are portraying. They also had to be convincing skating and in some scenes surfing. Watch the movie again with Peralta and Alva's commentary running and you will see and hear how close they got it to the real life these guys had. How can you say Emile Hirsch is one dimensional? John Robinson does most of his own skating. Peralta himself doubles for the multiple 360s in the Delmar contest scene. The real Alva does some as well. I've never even skated, but I lived through the seventies and I thought it was like stepping back into the past. Very convincing. The only thing I would have done differently would be to develop Wentzle's character more-he is a hoot in the documentary."
"reneweddan","10","11","14","16 October 2010"," Enjoy it with an open mind
","I am not a fan of surfing or skateboarding (although learning to surf is on my bucket list), but I decided to watch this film due to some of the names on the cast list such as Emile Hirsch, Heath Ledger, and a small appearance by Jeremy Renner. (Heath Ledger... what talent!)<br/><br/>The film begins as a surfing movie, then transitions into skateboarding, but the execution is amazing. I hardly watch movies without checking the time left, due to my incessant need to know everything, yet I didn't feel inclined to do so during this film. What that means is that the film has a perfect flow, it will keep you interested throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>It's a fictionalized film of ""The Z-Boys"" and how they revolutionized the sport of skateboarding. The film has much to do with skateboarding, but the main scenes are coming-of-age related and it really shows the simplicity of life that we take advantage of. There's many things you can take from this film: from fame, fortune, and success to humbleness, health, and friendship.<br/><br/>I thought this film would be a somewhat decent, but I was so wrong, it is an inspirational and interesting piece of art. I highly recommend this film if you have an open mind. If you aren't moved by the end, then you aren't human."

","Stacey Peralta's documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" served as the springboard for ""Lords of Dogtown,"" a fictionalized account of extreme skateboarding's birth. Poor teenagers from Dogtown, an area of Venice Beach, CA, emerged from relative obscurity to become superstars and make skateboarding into a true counterculture.<br/><br/>This is director Catherine Hardwicke's second feature. I really wanted to like her first film, 2003's ""Thirteen,"" but like that effort ""Dogtown"" falls victim to some scattershot storytelling and poor direction.<br/><br/>Events happen with little explanation or background and characters do things that seem totally inconsistent with their past actions. The actors do what they can, but this ultimately seems like a textbook example of poor direction and screenplay resulting in a subpar product.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger, sporting fake teeth, scraggly hair and an everpresent cigarette, hams it up like an actor twice his age as Dogtown skateboard guru Skip Engblom. The main trio of teens, portrayed by Emile Hirsch, John Robinson and Victor Rasuk, are played as little more than caricatures, with no motivation for their performances. Michael Angronaro fares the best of all the actors, playing a doomed rich boy who longs to be part of the Dogtown culture.<br/><br/>It feels like there could have been a good dramatized feature made from this true story, but this is definitely not it. This deserved a director with a true knack for the visual and a screenplay devoid of clichés."
"static_addict","3","42","76","22 November 2005"," Lords of Dogpoop
","Okay, I rented this movie the other day in high hopes of seeing a good true story on the lives of the skateboard legends from Venice but I was wrong, very wrong. We will do this Sergio Leone style: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.<br/><br/>-----The Good------<br/><br/>-The cinematography is the best part about this film. This film has a documentary look and a very high contrast color tone. The camera is shaky and realistic looking. It makes this film seem more like a true story than the acting does.<br/><br/>-The skate boarding in this film was mostly done by the actual actors. It was fast and true to the 70s era of extreme skating.<br/><br/>-Heath Ledger. Undougtingly the best actor in this film. But he really reminded me of Jim Morrison more than anything else. Oh yeah, he was pretty much drunk the entire film.<br/><br/>------The Bad------ <br/><br/>-The Story. It seemed like this story of the Z-Boys really needed more dialog. Most of the film is them skateboarding, then pissing someone off, breaking car windows and then running off. This film did delve into their careers as professional skateboarders but did it in a lagging 107 minute running time, when this story could have been told in 80.<br/><br/>-The Acting. If you had seen director Catherine Hardwicke's last film ""Thirteen"" you would think that she knows how to push actors to their breaking point, but this film really lacks emotion and effort. The acting is as childish as watching a school play. I guess that the actors were cast for their skateboarding skills rather than their acting.<br/><br/>------The Ugly------ <br/><br/>-Rebecca De Mornay. *shutters*. What happened to that hot girl from ""Risky Business""? Maybe she got old. Or its the fact that she was suppose to be a crack head in this film, or it is because nobody cared.<br/><br/>-John Robinson. Playing Stacy Peralta looks like he needs some sort of toner on his cheeks. The whole way through the movie I was thinking, ""who smacked him in the face?"".<br/><br/>So there it is, my analysis on ""Lords of Dogtown"". If you want to see the true story of the Z-Boys, watch ""Dogtown and the Z-boys"". This movie was a shot and miss on all fronts."

","Being a skateboarder myself, this movie resonates with me very deeply. This was the movie that got me into skateboarding in the first place, so it holds a very special place in my life. <br/><br/>The movie is based on the real-life Zephyr Skateboard Team, consisted of skateboarders and surfers based in Venice, California during the 70's. Although the whole team is portrayed, the movie focuses on the lives of Stacy Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams - their troubled rise to fame, their relationships to each other, and the secondary aspects of their lives.<br/><br/>The movie is very well made, they managed to create a skateboarding movie that can appeal to both skateboarders and non-skaters, as there are enough skate scenes to catch the attention of the hardcore crowd, but the story in itself is good enough to hold the general public's attention. That it is a very good feat because it could have been a very goofy movie otherwise. Furthermore, the acting is generally good, the best performances in my opinion belonging to Emile Hirsch as Jay Adams and of course, Heath Ledger as Skip Engblom. Victor Rasuk as Tony Alva came across to me as a little bit forced. <br/><br/>The Soundtrack in this movie is great also.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good movie that appeals to everyone, and at the same time pays tribute to skateboarding's most iconic team. <br/><br/>Plot: 5/5 Acting: 4/5 Soundtrack: 5/5<br/><br/>Overall: 8/10"
"vertigo_14","3","73","153","30 July 2005"," Unnecessarily redundant: the legend askew. (spoilers)
","You have two ways of learning about the early history and transformation of skateboarding from kiddie fad to extreme commercial success. That is, through former Z-Boy Stacey Peralta's stylish documentary released in 2002, or through the 2005 fictionalized Hollywood mainstream feature inspired by the events (and directed by 'Thirteen' director Catherine Hardwicke and written by Peralta).<br/><br/>While I thoroughly enjoyed the former, I was quite disappointed with the latter. And, the argument that it can only be appreciated and understood by the most hardcore of skaters is completely stupid. You don't have to skate well (or at all) to enjoy a good skate movie. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, unlike Peralta's fantastic documentary, Dogtown and Z-Boys, this fictionalized ""legend"" paid little homage to the sport itself and the Zephyr team (beyond just Peralta, Alva, and Adams). Lords of Dogtown, without context and with such annoyingly abrupt and disoriented storytelling almost makes it like Stacey Peralta, Tony Alva, and Jay Adams invented skateboarding. Dogtown, the sacred skater tale turned mainstream, has been given a Hollywood polish, establishing a mythical celebration of personal arrogance rather than honest insight for the team and the sport. And that leaves little to distinguish it from other Hollywood productions. Instead, there was little focus on how these teenagers love of skating completely revolutionized the skateboarding in ways that relieved it of a tired 1960s paradigm and transforming and laying the foundation for primitive technology with the most intense performance (not to mention a substantial commercial success even to this day). This this legend is told slightly askew. <br/><br/>Above all else (and I believe this was due to legal problems), critical founders of the team as well as members of the team themselves were omitted entirely. You're just watching the Embloom, Adams, Alva, and Perlata show the whole time. Jeff Ho, cofounder of Zephyr surf shop, was absent. As were team riders Paul Constantineau, Nathan Pratt, and others seen in the documentary (although, I can see why Chris Cahill was out). Bob Biniak was a tremendous skater in his day. As was Shogo. Where were they? (Granted, Shogo has about a two-second scene).<br/><br/>Likewise, the events in the story appear to move too fast and in such a scattered manner, dwarfing their true impact on the changes that skateboarding would undergo. The viewer is never really given time to digest it, or actually, to appreciate what it was about the Z-boyz style of skating that was so important when reviewing the sport. The skateboarding contest was ridiculous and rather condescending, if not simply exaggerated. <br/><br/>Watching this movie was as though you watched the documentary and pulled pieces from it which were to be given greater anecdotal backstory such as Skip Embloom's obnoxious presence at the Del Mar contests, Jay Adam's wild nature (only they thought to reference this at unusual points of the film), or Sid, the young man who died of brain cancer who's Dog Bowl swimming pool sessions in the last moments of his life were credited for reuniting the Z-Boyz for a few last runs (although the documentary features more than just the same three skaters skating in these sessions). But like everything else, nothing was told in a way fully developed enough to give the viewer some sense of order, never mind some sense of appreciation of what the stories of Dogtown. The film actually tries to duplicates sections of the documentary, as well, including the soundtrack ('Old man look at my life...' plays when Jay scores poorly at what appears to be his last contest; Ted Nugent's 'Cat Scratch Fever' cues at the contest). What was the purpose for trying to duplicate what was already a finely crafted documentary? I can't help but to look at this as an exhaustive attempt to praise Alva, Adams, and Peralta, or the Dogtown in general because people could be satisfied with the documentary alone as well-made as it was. Instead, some have found an opportunity to cash in even further on the fact that now the mainstream not only knows the story, but now knows the name of those most recognized from the team (and Engbloom, but only because of Heath Ledger being cast in the film).<br/><br/>Aside from shoddy story telling, the acting wasn't great. Victor Rasauk was a miscast. Emille Hirsch never fully captures Jay Adams as the rambunctious pre-fame youngster and spent most of the film giving his trademark distant stares, regardless of mood changes. John Robinson did alright as Peralta, probably because Perlata himself was able to coach him. My biggest complaint with casting is that they should've hired actual skaters to play the parts rather than succumb to the marketing potential of the pre-teen crowd. (The names are obviously a draw, cashing in on the pret-teen girl market). Although, the skating sequences were nice enough to make you want to grab a board and go out and dig up old snake runs.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for a Dogtown tale because it is about skateboarding first and foremost, you would do best to capture the history in it's most stylish and honorable form in Peralta's documentary, Dogtown and Z-Boys."

","Having been dragged to this movie preview by my 9 year old skateboarding son, my expectations were low. This film was well done, and did not require a dramatic denouement. The biggest surprise was Heath Ledger, who casts off his pretty boy image and chews up the scenery. My 16 year old daughter is going to love it because of the boys, the board-boys will love it because it chronicles the history of the sport, and parents like me will be swept away by the soundtrack alone. I hope this film gets the attention it deserves. My husband had seen the trailer and warned me that I was in for snooze, but I was actually quite engaged the entire time. I am currently putting together a program in Seattle that will pair teen skaters with beginners in exchange for community service hours. Hopefully this film will reinvigorate the sport and draw more attention to the need for decent skate parks in the area."

","Lords of Dogtown was a great idea for a film. A true story involving a lesser known but potentially riveting aspect of recent American life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, someone bought into the Hollyweird hype and hired Catherine Hardwicke. Instead of a director, they got someone whose only directorial move is to constantly shake the camera.<br/><br/>Frankly, this is a great example of the state of current studio cinema that someone as incompetent as Hardwicke would get assignment after assignment.

","rating: 2 out of 4  Director: Catherine Hardwicke Cast: John Robinson, Emile Hirsch, Heath  Ledger, Victor Rasuk, Nikki Reed Screenplay: Stacy Peralta MPAA  Classification: PG-13 (drug and alcohol content, sexuality, violence,  language and reckless behavior-all involving teens)  The problem with Lords of Dogtown lies in its approach to the material.  Written by Stacy Peralta, one of the three ""lords"" mentioned in the  title, the film seems to want to tell a story about rebellion,  teenagers, and skateboarding, but this novel effort is eclipsed by box  office pressures of the Summer film release season. The big wigs at the  distributors don't want an art-house film on their hands during June,  they want high-profile adrenaline charged action that will pull  teenagers in by the droves. This pressure probably led to a neutering  of the original screenplay and the old snip-snip of explicit content  which would make the film R, instead of a profit-producing PG-13.  Consequently, Lords of Dogtown is a ""bleh""-quality sports film that  only brushes the surface of its potential.   Skip (Heath Ledger) is the king of Dogtown, which in reality is Venice,  California. It's the sixties, and surfing in California is a rapidly  growing fad. Skip owns Zephyr surf shop, dedicated to the philosophy of  allowing his workers to surf and work on their own hours and terms,  consequently leaving him with the bills piling up. An idea sparks when  new skateboard wheels arrive at his shop and open up the possibilities  of skateboarding becoming a sport, not a hobby for when the waves are  flat. He decides to start the Zephyr Skate Team. Hired for the team,  among others, are Jay (Emile Hirsch), Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), and Sid  (Michael Angarano). The only one with a smooth temper and a fair head  on his shoulders, Stacy (John Robinson), is also the only one left out  of the team. But this all changes when Zephyr attends their first Skate  competition. Amping up the tunes and transforming the gymnastic-like  sport into one of style, Team Zephyr lands Jay the bronze and Tony with  a potential gold had he not picked a fight with an opposing coach.  However, Stacy decides to show up without a team and ends up with the  silver, proving his talent to Skip. Now with Team Zephyr complete, Jay,  Tony, and Stacy take on the Skateboarding world and make their way to  the top. But when a reporter from ""Skateboarder Magazine"" does a cover  story on the boys everything changes.   What's so agonizing about Lords is all that it actually has going for  it. There's obviously great potential here, but the screenplay just  never pulls through. Most noticeably, the time period director  Catherine Hardwicke creates is nearly flawless. The soundtrack features  great tunes from the era of sixties hard rock, instead of a cop-out  rap/techno backdrop that haunts many of these period sports films  nowadays. The town of Venice is also stylishly re-created. The sets  achieve the mood of a laid-back surfer town with postage-stamp  developments of a suburbia from the fifties. I found it easy to sink  into Hardwicke's world of Dogtown and believe every inch of it.   Also impressive is Heath Ledger's performance. Even though the  screenplay never completes his story, as it does with the ""Lords"",  Ledger's character is the most convincing. Shaving his Australian  accent, Ledger holds a perfect drunken Californian drawl the entire  film. And of all the characters, his is the most dynamic. His character  isn't bound by the stereotypes the others are. He's pathetic,  motivating, rousing, obnoxious, rewarding, and lovable all at once.  He's essentially human. He's the sort of guy we all know. The guy we  aren't quite sure if we love or if we hate. If for nothing else, Lords  of Dogtown deserves a bit of recognition for Ledger's portrayal of  Skip.  But Skip aside, Lords' characters are flat. Their written as  one-dimensional stereotypes that never grow or react to their  environments. Also, none are all that likable. Even Stacy, the kind  one, is sometimes too kind and eventually ends up abandoning his roots  for fame and fortune. We're constantly being alienated from these  characters because the story never allows us to like or even relate to  them. They're kept the one-dimensional characters they started as, even  if their hair-dos may have changed.   How can a film about the sixties, rebellion, teenager-hood,  skateboarding, and revolution be rated PG-13? Since when was the  rebellious behavior of the sixties a tame subject? Lords of Dogtown  likes to believe it was. They try their best, they really do, but with  a PG-13 rating strapping it down, what chance did it really ever have?  Language is kept absent, sex is suggested but not witnessed, drugs and  alcohol are the same, and mostly, Lords skips around every aspect of  the sixties that made it what it's known for. This castration of  material makes the film disappointingly less believable. And with  one-dimensional characters and some poor acting on the parts of Tony,  Jay, and Stacy, Lords of Dogtown is little more than an afternoon  endeavor for only the most hardcore of skaters.   -Sam Osborn"

This movie has something for everyone: hot guys, hot girls, skateboarding, surfing, and one of the best soundtracks since Almost Famous. It's also a fun look at the 70s that, like Dazed and Confused before it, filled me with envy of my parents who got to enjoy their youth during that decade of awesome music and rebellious sentiments. I think anyone can find something to like about this movie whether it's the friendship theme, growing up, fame at a young age, the exciting soundtrack, the surfing, or the skateboarding.

I wanted to like it, but I was bored to tears, and left the movie before it ended. I also remember that my son who grew up in the 70's had skateboards that were much further advanced, so the time line on The Lords of Dogtown, seemed to be in the mid 60's, and not the 70's as the movie depicted<br/><br/>The clincher for me, was how a Producer of Art Linsons stature, could economize on the music. I wanted to hear the soundtrack of the time, but I found the music was very generic........ It's to bad, because I noticed that he worked with his son on this project, somehow the vision was not executed in a compelling manner......"
"blend_ashtey11","9","5","7","5 February 2010"," An entertaining film with a strong cast and a great direction
","When I first heard about this, I couldn't wait to see it, mainly because of Heath Ledger, as I wanted to see if he could pull it off, and do you know what? He does, and it's not surprising.<br/><br/>The film is based on the ''Z-Boys'' and how they revolutionized skateboarding in the 1970's.<br/><br/>Firstly, the acting is strong. Heath Ledger is mesmerising as ''Skip Engblom'' (the Z-Boy's mentor), who resembles Johnny Depp's ''Jack Sparrow''. Ledger plays the drunken and swaggering Engblom effectively, and is the most charismatic on screen. Ledger has stage presence and is the heart and soul of the film.<br/><br/>Meanwhile he is supported well by the array of young actors within the film. Actually, although not as great as Heath Ledger, Michael Angarano gives an energetic performance as ''Sid'' and later an emotional performance, which is bound to send tears to some.<br/><br/>The film is directed well by director Catherine Hardwicke, who later directed Twilight. With her directing and Stacey Peralta's writing the movie is an overall entertaining, funny yet emotional and energetic piece of film-making."
"christian123","4","8","13","31 July 2006"," A decent film with a few engaging scenes and characters.
","In the mid-70's, a group of teen surfers from Venice, California formed a skateboarding team known as the ""Z-Boyz"", turning a fad into a sport by introducing a number of wild surfing-influenced moves that had not been seen before. But the fame and fortune that came along with their newfound notoriety eventually leads to friction between the friends.<br/><br/>I don't really like skateboarding so I thought this film was going to be boring but it turned out to be enjoyable. The characters were realistic and the drama was intense. Also, the skateboarding scenes were pretty impressive even if a couple of them ran longer than they should have. The screenplay was pretty routine and predictable but it was still engaging. It was written by Stacy Peralta who just happens to be one of the characters in the movie. Unsurprisingly, Stacy Peralta was the nicest character in the film and he was also one of the best skaters in the film. I wonder if it really happened like this or if Peralta was just making himself look good. They should have asked all of the original ""Z-Boyz"" to pen the script even though there's a documentary on the same story.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was kind of slow and dull. It took awhile for things to get going. However, the second half picked up and it was a lot more exciting. The ending was really nice even if it was a little cheesy. It was my favorite part in the film since it was more than a little heartwarming. Catherine Hardwicke did a horrible job behind the camera. She moved the camera rapidly with quick editing and I guess she was trying to get a documentary feel to the film. It didn't work out very well. It was messy and it seemed like a desperate attempt for drama and excitement. Also, the dialog was exaggerated and annoying. I know skateboarders really do speak like that but only to a point. They really went overboard with it and it was very unnecessary.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good with Emile Hirsch giving the best performance. His character was the most developed and interesting one. He handled the role well and he should become a big star one day. Victor Rasuk was also pretty good as Tony though a little annoying. John Robinson was okay, a little dull though. Heath Ledger was pretty funny as Skip and his character was a good idol for the young skaters. Rebecca De Mornay gave a horrible performance that was completely fake and unbelievable. Michael Angarano played Sid and his performance was pretty good. It was sad to watch at times because of the illness Sid had and what it did to him. This is why I really liked the ending because it was just the boys skating with Sid watching them. The majority of the film was on the forgettable side but the ending was really touching. In the end, Lords of Dogtown is worth checking out for skater fans otherwise approach with caution.

","Director Catherine Hardwicke, who helped a few teenagers discover the versatility of the tongue in ""Thirteen"" (2003), takes an impressive cast and crew back to the year 1975. The ""Disco"" storm was crashing airwaves, but not at Venice Beach, California. There, the pre-punk ""Lords of Dogtown"" ramped up skateboarding ""to the extreme"" and made it a sport.<br/><br/>Opening with the familiar phrase, ""Inspired by a true story,"" this is a fictionalized film version of the superior documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" (2001) - which anyone interested in skateboarding as sport should see. Hardwicke's young ""Lords"" are Emile Hirsch (as Jay Adams), Victor Rasuk (as Tony Alva), and John Robinson (as Stacy Peralta). They are introduced in an excellent opening sequence, but the story doesn't get off the ground until about halfway through. We get a lot of documentary-styled scenes - which don't really do anything to improve upon ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" - before getting to know the three leading men. It might be interesting to see Mr. Peralta's original story idea, because much of this story seems whitewashed.<br/><br/>Crack a board, bro <br/><br/>The real drama herein arguably centers on Mr. Hirsch's character. The three actors are fine, but Hirsch is given the best material. As his sexy, sand-blasted mother, Rebecca De Mornay (as Philaine) helps. And, Hirsch gets to sing the ""Slinky"" theme song. Watch for a truly magical moment when, after losing a contest, Hirsch sails off the pier; photographed beautifully by Elliot Davis, it combines the thrills you experience surfing and skateboarding. Also on hand, in an stumbling and underwritten role, is wasted surfer Heath Ledger (as Skip Engblom). Better utilized is the role played by fellow traveler Michael Angarano (as Sid). He helps give the film an unexpected, uplifting ending by taking the three estranged ""Lords"" back to their roots.<br/><br/>****** Lords of Dogtown (6/3/05) Catherine Hardwicke ~ Emile Hirsch, Victor Rasuk, John Robinson, Heath Ledger"

","This film charts the rise of the legendary ""Z-Boys"" of California: Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), Stacy Peralta (John Robinson), and Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch). After they go to work for board designer Skip Engblom (Heath Ledger), they pioneer a new style of skateboarding that wins them lots of success and acclaim. Of course, as is often the case, this fame is not without some costs. Stacy (who wrote the screenplay) emerges as the most even-keeled of the trio, while Tony gets a fairly swelled head.<br/><br/>""Lords of Dogtown"" will surely resonate most for those people who came of age and forged their friendships in the 1970s, as well as all aficionados of the sport of skateboarding. For this viewer, it took a while to really grab hold, because it suffered from some excess. There's more footage than is really necessary of characters indulging in various forms of bad behaviour. Fortunately, as we actually see some humanity and humility from some of the principals, the story becomes more engaging. The hyperactive camera-work and quick cuts are distracting at first, but it's hard to argue with a soundtrack as cool as this one. There's one great rock song of the era after another. The moves performed by the actors' stunt doubles do provide some pretty good thrills.<br/><br/>The cast is fine and full of familiar faces: Rasuk, Robinson, and Hirsch are very well supported by Ledger, whose colourful performance is most welcome, and performers such as Rebecca De Mornay (always nice to see her in anything), Johnny Knoxville, William Mapother, Julio Oscar Mechoso, Nikki Reed, Pablo Schreiber, Elden Henson, Michael Angarano, Mitch Hedberg, America Ferrera, Sofia Vergara, Charles Napier, Bai Ling, Shea Whigham, Joel McHale, and Alexis Arquette. The real Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, and Jay Adams have cameos, as does Tony Hawk; Jeremy Renner appears unbilled.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent snapshot of the L.A. skateboarding and surfing scene throughout the 1970s, with text at the end telling us what became of the principals.<br/><br/>Peralta also directed the documentary feature ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"".<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","In the ""grand tradition"" of Michael Bay and McG, here is a new name to consider for the pantheon of directors without the slightest clue how to make a film: Catherine Hardwicke.<br/><br/>Ms. Hardwicke tries to hide that sad fact by hyping her lack of knowledge as a ""style"", but really, when has shaking the camera indiscriminately at everything in sight been a style? Rather watching one of her movies makes you cringe and wonder what happened to the art of movie making.<br/><br/>Lords of Dogtown follows in the footsteps of Thirteen in the exercise of fake ""documentary-style"" filming that a real documentarian would be ashamed of. Guess what, documentary filmmakers don't shake the camera at things.

","The Z-Boys were a group of Venice Beach teenagers who, in the 1970's, pioneered a whole new style of skateboarding that is still popular today and which earned the boys status as instant international celebrities (at least within the tightly circumscribed world of skating). In 2001, one of the original members of the group, Steve Peralta, wrote and directed a documentary on the boys entitled ""Dogtown and Z-Boys,"" which featured interviews with many of the original members of the group. Then, in 2005, a ""fictionalized"" version of the story came along, ""Lords of Dogtown,"" also written by Peralta, but this time directed by Catherine Hardwicke.<br/><br/>It's understandable that in her approach to the material Hardwicke would want to preserve as much as possible the roughhewn, documentary flavor of the original. Thus, virtually the entire movie has been shot on grainy film stock using a hand-held camera, which creates a sense of immediacy and spontaneity, and nicely approximates the look of the time period in which the story is set. The best scenes involve the boys performing harrowing, death-defying stunts, as they glide through and around pedestrians and vehicles along the traffic-clogged streets of their Southern California neighborhood. However, this impressionistic style also means that the narrative is often diffuse and unfocused, making it hard for us to distinguish one character from another and to know just who we should be concentrating on at any given moment. The ostensible protagonist seems to be Peralta himself, although it is roughly 45 minutes into the film's running time before even that simple fact becomes apparent. However, about halfway through the film, the dramatic elements finally begin to come together, we get to know some of the boys as individuals, and the movie ends on a genuinely touching note.<br/><br/>In the rare moments when the camera actually manages to settle down and an individual scene is allowed to play itself out, we begin to sense that some of the boys playing the skaters may actually have some real talent as actors (we can certainly see that they are damn fine skaters), and a few of them I suspect we will be hearing from again in the not too distant future. In a non-skating role, Heath Ledger plays a sort of mentor to the boys and the owner of the surf shop which served as the launching pad for the movement. Unfortunately, with his half-hearted attempt at mastering a slacker/stoner persona and accent, Ledger seems to be merely marking time in this film, counting down to that moment when he would stun the world with his soul-shattering performance in ""Brokeback Mountain."" Who could have foretold from his work here that he had THAT up his sleeve? ""Lords of Dogtown"" is moderately informative to those who know next to nothing about the history of skateboarding, but I imagine it is the true aficionado of the sport who will get the most enjoyment out of the movie"

","""Lords of Dogtown"" is a rollicking companion piece to Stacy Peralta's documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" about the very young men who transformed skateboarding into a commercial extreme sport.<br/><br/>Director Catherine Hardwicke has a marvelous, visual instinct for capturing the lightning in a bottle that is the energy of adolescence, as she demonstrated with teenage girls in ""Thirteen."" While the actors are actually a few years older than the founders of the movement, astoundingly, were, they explode with adolescent fidgeting on the screen that then channels hormonal and emotional frustrations into constant movement on first surfboards then skateboards.<br/><br/>This film fills in many of the gaps in their personal lives that were frustratingly missing from the documentary, with evident artistic license as some characters are composites. Some rough edges are left out or smoothed over to keep it from the usual sex, bad contracts and rock 'n' roll biographies.<br/><br/>I had no idea that suburban-sweet little Emile Hirsch from ""Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" and ""Imaginary Heroes"" was a Venice Beach sk8ter boy in his real life, albeit New School, so that he could so naturally embody the lithe, rebellious Jay Adams, who starts from and rolls to darker places than his cohorts.<br/><br/>Brought much more to the fore is Tony Alva's Chicano family and Victor Rasuk shows that as in ""Raising Victor Vargas"" he can passionately portray youthfulness and growing into maturity.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Peralta may be a bit self-serving in how he lets his almost too nice younger self be so sunnily portrayed by John Robinson as the very image of a Southern California beach boy, but an incongruously responsible one -- he actually wears a watch to get to a real job. We learn even less here about his background than any of the other kids.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger transforms himself into a stoner surfer Fagin, revealing better than the documentary the rise and collapse of the odd mentoring relationship the sponsor of the Zephyr Team created with boys who needed some kind of father figure in their lives.<br/><br/>The restless, jangly cinematography races after them like a helmet-cam from the opening shots, on land, sea and especially in empty swimming pools, soaking up their vibes and momentum with quick editing.<br/><br/>While this is more a clear-eyed cautionary ode to too-much too-fast adolescence than to testosterone, the women in their lives are given only a little more acknowledgment than in the documentary. Rebecca De Mornay, who started her career as a teen boy's lust object in ""Risky Business,"" ironically now plays Jay's unstable mom, but she is not drawn as substantively as the similar mom in ""Thirteen."" <br/><br/>Just as most rockers admit that they first slapped on a guitar to get chicks, this film is up front that the boys attracted groupies, and makes a half-hearted effort to personalize a couple of the young women for whom they compete, or maybe Nikki Reed is just miscast as Alva's sister. Even the concluding scroll about their futures, much more upbeat than in the documentary, leaves out their detritus of the women in their lives.<br/><br/>The re-created settings and production design of the notorious Pacific Ocean Park Pier well illustrate the class differences between these outlaw locals vs. beach blanket surfer movies and the owners of those prized pools.<br/><br/>The period music is mostly used just for atmosphere, from the opening riffs of Jimi Hendrix's guitar, but occasionally hits home with a character's mood, particularly Neil Young's ""Old Man"" and Rod Stewart's ""Maggie May."" The hair styles, clothes and make-up are also much better done, including the wigs, than most '70's period movies, though why cover up the countless bruises the cast suffered, as presumably in real life the guys must have been banged up besides the one incident shown.<br/><br/>Stay through all the credits to see clips of the real folks, including a sweet tribute to Jay as the font of the style."

Some fighting occurs in several scenes, as does some property damage.<br/><br/>Some of that material may be unsettling to some viewers, while various characters have varying degrees of bad attitudes. Various teens and others drink, some use drugs (and drug related comments are made) and some smoke. Finally, some tense family material is present in strained relationships between teens and parents or parent figures.<br/><br/>Should you still be concerned about the film's appropriateness for yourself or anyone else in your home, you may want to look more closely at our detailed listings for more specific information regarding the film's content.<br/><br/>For those prone to visually induced motion sickness, a great deal of the ""you are there,"" documentary style, hand-held camera footage will definitely affect some viewers."

","Because I work with Swedish subtitles I had the chance to see this movie a while ago. I liked it. Lords of Dogtown has a great cast such as Heath Ledger, Emile Hirsch, Victor Rasuk, John Robinson, Nikki Reed, Michael Angarano, Johnny Knoxville and Rebecca De Mornay among others.<br/><br/>In the mid 1970's, a group of teenage surfers from a tough neighborhood known as ""Dogtown"" in Venice, California pioneered a revolutionary new style of skateboarding. Riding the waves at the Pacific Ocean Park pier, the Z-Boys, known for their aggressive style and hard street attitude, combined the death-defying moves of surfing with the art of skateboarding and became overnight sensations and local legends. With empty pools as their canvas, the Z-Boys paved the way to what is now referred to as ""extreme sports,"" and created a lifestyle that spread infectiously to become a worldwide counterculture phenomenon. But all of this fame would take its toll on the friendships that they thought would last a lifetime as the sport that started out as an afternoon hobby turned into big business.<br/><br/>Everyone was good, especially Heath Legder. He stars as Skip, the Z-Boys' party-animal ringleader whose money-hungry ways tear the boys apart. The director Catherine Hardwicke was not the first in mind of making this movie, she took over after David Fincher decided to leave the project for another feature. She did a great job creating the life among skateboarders, surfers and party animals in the 70's California. It's about the Z-Boys. They made skateboarding an art form, infusing it with the death-defying grace of surfing. I think this movie is worth a 7/10."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","6","14","32","19 February 2006"," kind of loses its edge halfway through
","It's not that this is a bad movie, by any means. It's good, and the first half of the movie gets a 9 out of 10, for how fun, crazy, and just flat out cool it is. But after Johnny Knoxville appears (I'm not knocking him, the downhill motion begins after his appearance), this movie just falls apart.<br/><br/>Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch - The Emperor's Club, The Girl Next Door), Stacy Peralta (John Robinson - Elephant) and Tony Alva (Victor Rusak - Raising Victor Vargas) are all the hottest skateboarders in the early 1980's California, in an area known as Dogtown. This movie is an actual story account of Stacy Peralta's award winning documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys. We meet the skaters, and their skate shop owner/sponsor Skip (believe it or not, it's Oscar nominee Heath Ledger), and their buddy who tags along after them, but never could skate, Syd (Michael Angarano - Sky High), we watch the skaters have a blast just skating, breaking rules, throwing parties, having sex, you know...doing 80's things.<br/><br/>After the competitions end, and Johnny Knoxville appears and signs Tony away from Skip, the movie loses its edge, which sends it to the ground faster than a skater after a busted rail grind. The actors also seem to lose their grip. Hirsch's character becomes flatly moody and angry, and you never see anything else. It's hard to believe Robinson's Peralta, because after a while, he just doesn't seem like a skater from the 80's. I don't want to know what could have happened had the real Stacy Peralta not written this movie and not been there to help Robinson. Heath Ledger is probably the only consistent performer in the film, but he doesn't have a lot of screen time. His performance is the real treat of the movie, a complete 180 from what we're used to from him. Victor Rusak's Tony Alva seems to be okay, but once again, he is very one dimensional, and this goes for all the characters until a crucial turning point where we learn something tragic about another character (don't want to spoil it).<br/><br/>This movie had a lot of potential, but just didn't live up to it as much as I hoped. I really wanted this movie to succeed, because of my personal attachment to the world of skateboarding through my friends and brothers (I'm kind of like Syd, because I can't skate to save my life). As I've said before, this movie is excellent for the first 50 minutes to an hour, but just falls off the table after that. It's a good rent at best, but Stacy Peralta's writing saves it from being a total bomb. Godspeed to director Catherine Hardwicke on finding another job after this one, because without Peralta, this movie sinks like a stone. If you listen closely to the narration, you'll know that Sean Penn narrates it. I recommend this to teenagers and middle aged adults that were like the characters, because you could relate to them.<br/><br/>6/10 --spy"

","I have been awaiting the release of this film for a while. I was expecting some good surf and skate footage, some historical locations, and some good tunes. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The movie was way more than that. I was expecting a little sensationalism and flare, but this film didn't go that route. It really had a personal feel to it. The all-too-real emotions that go along with growing up with your buddies, the girls, and finding where you fit in this world really came through, I think. <br/><br/>I really can't wait to see it again. I love the soundtrack; it has great song selections from the era. And the feel of this film is cool. It almost feels like you're watching a movie from the period. They really captured a sense of the not-so-mainstream California beach culture.<br/><br/>Having been born and raised in California, this film touched a place deep in my heart. Anyone who has grown up this way will certainly identify with the movie.

It brings everything full circle. I think it says it all."

","I had the privilege to go to an advanced screening of this film in Seattle on April 6. Since it was my first advanced screening I may be biased (due to the fact it cost nothing for me.) This is my first review for an advanced screening, so it may be lacking in some respects. Please excuse this.<br/><br/>""The Lords of Dogtown"" us based on a group of rag-tag revolutionary skaters in the 1970s in Santa Monica, CA (aka Dogtown). Of the main group of skaters, I was only able to recognize the lead, Stacy, played by John Robinson of 2003's ""Elephant."" This group of skaters includes world famous skate champion Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), rich boy skater Sid, Michael Angarano, and problematic, Jay (Emile Hirsch.) The group of skaters, all teens at the time were once surfers who were introduced into the world of skateboarding via their older mentor(ish) friend, Skip, played by Heath Ledger. Skip creates the ""Zephyr's"" (Z boys) skateboarding team of his beachside surf shop. The Z Boys go around SoCal and go into competitions of skateboard and blow away the other competitors.<br/><br/>Each of the original ""Z Boys"" had their own cameo appearance in subtle locations throughout the film. Since most of the target audience, namely 13-21 year olds do not recognize these skaters, an there is a obvious newsreel cameo by Tony Hawk, playing an astronaut, (Who had more screen time than any other cameo, but who was, however, not a part of the Z Boys.) The possible 40-55 age group, who actually lived during this time, is only given teases of the original ""Z Boys"" Early in the film all of the characters are introduced as very similar, each with their own quirks and idiosyncrasies. Conveniently, the writer, Stacy Peralta, is the main character, which is the stand out of the group of friends, (He has a job, and responsibilities.) The movie does not really get interesting until the drought, Tony Alva devises a plan to use an empty pool as the skate locale. At this point in the film, his has been made and is presented in a manner for anyone to see that any city or private owned skate bowl was first derived from empty pools in Southern California.<br/><br/>The ""surfing world"" of the movie is shown with grainy, washed out images and looks to have used the same bleach bypass that Saving Private Ryan did. This part of the film gave the audience the impression that surfing was something to be washed out in their lives and to slowly fade away as their hobby/occupation of choice. The movie also employed, several times, the camera works of skateboarding videos, (Use of fish eye lenses and the ""man on the skateboard following people"" technique.) However, the use of these techniques is minimal and not consistent throughout the film. Some scenes we see it used on the streets, other times we see the streets, but no use of it at all. The beginning seemed to have a conflict of whether it was trying to be documentary/skate video like or Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the film chronicles the fame (and downfall for some) its characters, and their conflict between one another. The skaters start out as young, juvenile delinquents into famous, rich skaters. I expected this film to be as brainless as ""Grind,"" yet; I also expected something of quality given my previous viewing of ""The Dogtown and Z-Boys."" I was surprised that I was entertained and interested in the characters throughout the film.<br/><br/>The movie never feels like its leading up to a large climax, and the ""main event"" for the skaters never really feels like its important. It ends however on a good note, given all of the problems of each character. The movie was overall entertaining and gives an opportunity for current, young skaters to look into the past or even gasp talk to their parents about skateboarding in their day. When it ""Dogtown"" comes out on June 3rd, it will be the quintessential summer film, and may hopefully breathe new life into the excellent documentary it is connected with as well as the origin of modern skateboarding."
"deathbyphoto","7","12","31","3 June 2005"," A fun movie, not film
","When I first heard this film was being made, I was very excited because, despite being about 10 years too late, grew up inspired by the Z-Boys through the writings and photographs of C.R. Stecyk and Glen E. Friedman. Adams, Alva and Peralta are the three most important skateboarders ever. Heck... I have a Jay Adams tattoo portrait.<br/><br/>Then I had second thoughts fearing the Hollywood-ization of their story. I thought the drama of their tough lives in Venice would likely be glamorized and exploited with much of the truth unbelievably stretched. But I wasn't their to witness it, so I asked someone who was part of the Dogtown skate scene and friends with those the film is about, and he said that is exactly what the movie.<br/><br/>He also told me that if you're familiar with the true story or have even just seen the documentary (Dogtown & the Z-Boys), then the movie will just come off corny. But if you go into not expecting an intelligent film and just a fun movie, you may get just that. So I saw it today think it would be just that, and it was.<br/><br/>The skate scenes were all right, but excited me by striking up thoughts of the truth of it all. The aggressiveness of Ledger's portrayal of Skip Enblom seemed cheesy and over the top. The kids who played Peralta and Alva weren't terrible, too, but Emile Hirsch did a good job as Jay Adams. And I'm confused at who this Chino guy is. I'm guessing it's supposed to be Zephyr shop owner Jeff Ho who wouldn't have anything to do with the film.<br/><br/>It was funny to see cameos by Alva, Adams, Peralta, Skip and Bob Biniak. Tony Hawk's cameo was uncalled for. But overall, the film was enjoyable, especially by all everyone else in the theater, considering I was the only one above the age of 17 it seemed. And it's great to see the legend of these guys be spread to new generations, especially with skateboarding as popular than ever. I think all new skaters should recognize their roots.<br/><br/>I just hope people will make the effort to at least see the documentary and hopefully pick up Stecyk and Friedman's ""Dogtown - The Legend of the Z-Boys"" book and read all the original Skateboarder magazine stories and images. That can't be beat."

"film-critic","4","7","16","16 August 2007"," Lords of something, but perhaps not Dogtown
","Hardwicke, whom many of you remember as the brain child behind the fabulously gritty drama ""thirteen"", helms this project with the same gumption that she enlisted for her prior film. Using some of the same crew, same filming technique, and an over-hyped budget this film demonstrates that even the dirtiest of teen struggles can be glossed over to Hollywood standards. Egos aside, we are handed a Hardwicke special which includes (but is not limited to) shirtless tween hunks, a sense of invincibility over adults, a rockin' good soundtrack, a time frame that breaks all borders, and finally two actual stars that would be used to introduce an older audience that may not be familiar with teen main characters to pack theaters and make sure someone's child gets a college tuition. I am harsh with this film  again, why?  because this was supposed to be a group that was anti-establishment, anti-normality, anti-boundaries, yet seemed to fit well within this Hollywood box. I witnessed the innovators of a generation, sans Jay Adams, sell their souls for corporate glory. Sure, they may have wanted their story to be told for a new generation of skaters, but there could have been a better way to portray this creativity, struggle, and eventual breakdown of friendships. This was supposed to be like the grittier ""Stand by Me"", when instead it felt like Disney was an independent benefactor.<br/><br/>I thought Hardwicke's choice of cinematography, camera angle, and story placement seemed dated. She did this already in ""thirteen"", I wanted her to explore more boundaries, stronger moments, and really define herself as a director. Instead, I watched three times (two audio commentaries plague this disc) a director mimic their already golden film  even the choice of casting some of the same actors from ""thirteen"". After watching ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"", I was prepared to see a better side to their story. I wanted Hardwicke to take me places that Peralta's minimal budget couldn't. With Peralta writing the story, I didn't think he would allow anything to slip by. I was wrong. His choice to create small, more insignificant characters to help build credibility in our central three characters was pathetic. I wanted Peralta to interact with everyone from the Zephyr skate team, not just Jay, Tony, and himself. This was a collaborative effort from everyone, and not giving everyone their moment in the spotlight just seemed to make me grumpy. I loved hearing everyone's voice during the ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" film, and it hurt to just be focused on three while others were equally as successful. If this were the case, we should have had only one story  instead of trying to intermingle everything together. Stories were dropped, players were disrespected, and the true story became a muddled mess of semi-truth and Hollywood truth. Our actors did what they could, but were shaky as the main characters. John Robinson felt like he was back filming ""Elephant 2"", I just couldn't see him as any other character. Emile Hirsch was goofy, while I realized that Jay Adams was crazy (as we all know someone from our past like him), he just came off as arrogant and acting like he was a tormented teen. His scene on the burned pier with Heath was laughable at best. Victor, as Tony Alva, didn't carry the weight he was supposed to. He wasn't the best of the group, but he was the strongest, but Victor couldn't put any strength behind him. The three players did a decent job, but it was obvious from the opening scene that they weren't going to win awards for their portrayals.<br/><br/>I must compliment Hardwicke for her choice of Heath Ledger as Skip. From the documentary to the silver screen, Ledger did an amazing job of bringing this pivotal character to life. His voice, his mannerisms, his taut demeanor was exactly like watching the documentary. I loved it. It gave me faith that Heath could pull off The Joker in the upcoming ""Batman"" film. Alas, I cannot say the same for Rebecca De Mornay (who needs to do some independent work to get back into the business) and Johnny Knoxville. He is growing into an actor, but this was not the right character for him to tackle. Tony's financier needed to be meaner, pushier, and darker  none of which came from funnyman Knoxville. Everyone else involved seemed to hit their stride, as I enjoyed seeing some of my favorites playing cameo roles throughout the film. I must give credit to Hardwicke here as well for really bringing some (not all) of these guys into the project  I just wish she would have listened to them more when developing her style. She should have at least used all of them in the commentary, by just using Peralta and Alva, we knew who her favorites were. Where was Skip's side of the story? <br/><br/>Overall, I cannot say that this film compares in anyway, shape, or form to the documentary that Peralta created. I know that he wrote this film too, but it was obvious that one was written with the soul and the other was developed for the money. ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" spoke for itself, giving us a raw taste of what life was like back in the 70s on Venice Beach and in innovation that the surfers had for bringing a new style of sport into the limelight. I loved the music again, ""Maggie May"" near the end really struck a chord for me and developed Skip into this true player. I cannot suggest this film to friends because I will be devoting my time to suggesting the more impassioned ""Dogtown and Z-Boys""  especially the audio commentary  to them. I say watch the documentary, unless you like your stories with glossier endings.<br/><br/>Grade: ** ½ out of *****"

","I have been a skateboarder since the 70's. I lived through the rise of the Dogtown era. This movie details many of the events surrounding Dogtown crew and does so with nice accuracy for the skating, dress and attitude. What is does not do is expand on the emotions of the participants. How did they FEEL about all they were experiencing. The Documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys actually does a better job in this regard. Since there is little emotional engagement with the characters there is really no problem to work out in the third act. The movie seems to end abruptly. I think this movie is a decent effort overall however. Now that writer Stacy Peralta has this autobiographical movie out of his system I have high hopes that his next movie will be more focused on characters and their inner voice rather than showing all the events that made up an era."

","I did not have high hopes when I watched it as I don't even know how to skateboard. I watched it anyway, and it was a waste of my time.<br/><br/>Someone must have decided to make a skateboarding film by putting a lot of skateboard scenes together with a few talking scenes in between. As a result, the film seemed like an incoherent mix of scenes put together. There is a plot, which is all the actors do their own thing in the film. I do not feel for any of the characters in the film, and the film did not make me care about the characters either. The only redeeming feature of this film is that the skateboarding scenes are really cool, but I could have watched these scenes on a sports channel anyway. There is no cinematography, no character development and no substance. The film feels so empty."

Kathy (Nikki Reed) is Tony's sister.<br/><br/>This has the energy. It has the music. It has the rebel sensibility. It's a little disorganized. It's hard to know who's the lead at times. Director Catherine Hardwicke has left it very loose. Heath Ledger is eating up the scenes with his weird voice. Emile Hirsch is sort of the center. There are quite a few unknown actors here.

","Lords of Dogtown is a film about the legendary Z-Boys, who are credited with the creation of modern day skateboarding. The film chronicles the height of their success in the late 70's and their struggles in creating and rising to the top of a whole new industry. The story is terrific, written by one of the actual Z-Boys, but the way it was filmed was problematic. The beginning of the film is very choppy and confusing, honestly it's difficult to know who is who and what's going on until about the half way point of the film. The Z-Boys are the basis and stars of the film, but it's Heath Ledger who steals the show. He really had a gift for picking up on every mannerism and movement a person makes. People who know his character, Skip, say it's scary how much like him Ledger was. He was a truly gifted actor who would have been a legend. As for the film, it was interesting and a lot of information about a sport I always liked but never really thought much about. It's a bit confusing and shot in a weird style, but overall it really was pretty good."

","I recently re-watched this film in order to get the disgusting Scope mouthwash taste out of my mouth after recently checking out ""Mid 90s"". There are certain films that can be re-watched over and over for the things you missed the first time through. There are other films you watch to see if there were breadcrumbs leading up to the ""twist"" ending. Despite the ""spot the cameo of Tony Hawk"" moments, LODT is neither of those. It falls into the category of films built around the soul. All the critical reviews from 10+ years ago seem to have missed that point, expecting instead to see some great skate-narrative. This film instead gives a stream of events all connected to a spiritual center, and that is freedom.<br/><br/>It's in the surf shop, with the guys who abandon the board making to ride waves. It's in the driveway at night when Stacy is trying to make the team on his own. There is tragedy. There is triumph. There is even some comedy. The villian is, in true millennial form, profiteering corporations, and yet we secretly understand that the long term success that will or won't be had for the heroic doppelgangers of the actual bricklayers of modern skateboarding depends on money. And yet, despite all the money the sidekick Sid has, he can't buy himself a happy ending, nor does it look like he's so unhappy.<br/><br/>It sound like a lot of prosthletising, and yet it's just put in as a natural backdrop for realistic characters. Nobody feels like they have been politically engineered with a certain color skin or a certain sexual orientation to beat the audience with a stick over the head about. There are no pathetic lines about social justice, the environment, etc. And consequently as a work of storytelling, it's genuine, even if some people were disappointed by the lack of blow-by-blow in the history of skatboarding.<br/><br/>Also the cinematography is great. Someone in another review mentioned ""shaking camera"". I read that and wanted to tear my hair out. Because in the intervening 10 years, the idea of shaking the camera has come to mean jarring around the audience like they are in a washing machine spin cycle with a drunk cameraman. This film has some shake when it needs shake, and it has glide when it needs glide! The shots of the skating are great. You won't see anything like what is now common on X-games, but it's more or less period accurate tricks.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great film and has the perfect blend of vintage 70's window dressing and Gen-X gestalt."

","Lords of Dogtown (2005): Dir: Catherine Hardwicke / Cast: Emile Hirsch, Heath Ledger, Rebecca De Mornay, Johnny Knoxville, Nikki Reed: Set in the mid 1970's about a small group surfers and skaters. The film chronicles their true story rise to fame, those who refused, and those who were robbed of the success they deserved. It is realistically portrayed by director Catherine Hardwicke despite it being sometimes distracted or unfocused. The cast bring realism to characters who struggle with fame, upbringing and death. Emile Hirsch plays a skater who was rejected by locals yet gains success before being turned in the wrong direction. Heath Ledger steals scenes as a skateboard manufacturer who produces the team but despite all efforts he ends up watching them all depart to disappointments elsewhere. Interesting that Ledger is intelligent enough to remain true to himself and his work. Rebecca De Mornay plays a hippie mother on dope. Perhaps more screen time would have benefited. Johnny Knoxville is featured as someone out to steal a team promising fame and fortune. The role is straight forward but different for Knoxville. Nikki Reed is featured as a female romantic interest but thankfully the characters are written in a realistic manner in terms of their enthusiasm. Great skateboarding action and strong conviction of fame, success, betrayal, friendship, and the passion behind it all. Score: 9 / 10"

","This is a really great movie with a sad story of friends having a passion for skating but letting fame come in between them. In my opinion, this is a very underrated movie. The film included significant events that made skating what it is today, which is a bonus to me, especially since I skated a lot. I think the actors deserve much praise as well. To me, they made the movie seem not like movie at all, that Z skaters were just being filmed during their glory days, but I'm not in any way saying that the production was botched, just very good acting. After seeing the movie rating this movie 9 out 10 seemed right. If this film were become perfect it would need to be remastered for quality."

We would skate the biggest hill on our side of town and it was a challenge to make it all the way down. The music in this movie sets the tone for emotion. I thought Emile Hirsch was very good as Jay Adams in this film as the ""bad boy"" of the group. I think if you grew up in this time when skateboarding was becoming popular you would relate to it better. This movie was put together quite well and was very entertaining. This is definitely a good watch at least one time. I love the part of the film where they skate all the empty pools. How fun that would have been!"

It shows the rough times the boys go through as they try to figure out what's more important, friendship or fame.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger was quite the charmer, and I was a big fan of Emile Hirsch.

"xlopez1723","8","1","1","29 November 2011"," An amazing insight into the lives of the Z-Boys
","Warning!! Some spoilers!! This is a great movie that chronicles the start of the legendary Z-boys, and their rise from teenagers to skateboarding legends. This film comes off as a more stylized, and personal version of a documentary. You get high octane filming sequences in some parts, and in others you get a grasp of the emotional turmoil that these teenagers went through during this time period. From a technological standpoint this film accomplishes many great things.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great. There is this grainy high contrast view that you get of everything. It helps you immerse yourself into the diagesis. The high contrast makes it feel like its being shot by someone in that time period. The camera-work employed by Catherine Hardwicke can be sporadic during action scenes, as is her trademark with her movies. She uses many canted angles and dynamic shots. These work greatly with the action scenes, they help capture the motion of craziness that came from the lifestyle in the 1970's. When they bomb down Venice Hill, you watch the scene unfold from the point of view of the skateboard. It captures the speed and insanity of what they were doing at the time. <br/><br/>The angles and shots from the movie all evoke the feeling of you actually being there and watching the Z-boys rip. Each Z-Boy had his own aspirations and his own demons. Jay was the live in the moment boy of the three. He was all about speed and living the life. The camera-work exaggerates this by being sporadic and shaky whenever it is focused on him. You begin to understand how his life is destroying itself with how crazy the camera-work becomes for him. Stacy was the responsible one the three. He was the stable Z-Boy. He held down a job, and became a very successful man. The camera shots on him and controlled and medium shots to close ups. There aren't dynamics the way they exist for Jay because Stacy was composed. Tony Alva was on of the godfathers of skateboarding. He paved the way, and absolutely destroyed contests during his prime. He is the alpha male, the competitor. The camera exemplifies this by shooting a lot of low shots with Tony. This helps to give him a larger than life personality. Each Z-Boy was very different, but they were bound by their insatiable love for skateboarding. The cinematography was different for each Z-Boy, but it was brought together when they hit the streets on skateboards. <br/><br/>This is a great movie that gives a great view into the life of the Z-Boys. It shows their rise, the turmoil they faced, and it solidifies them as skateboarding Gods. Everyone will not enjoy this movie, but for skateboarding fans this movie is a glimpse into how it all began. It is an impeccable movie, and I highly recommend it for the average movie goer and skateboard enthusiast alike. It doesn't matter where you go as long as you remember where you started."

This movie is talking about a surf shop owner who started a skateboard team, which is a group of young talented skateboarders live in Dogtown in Santa Monica, California. Their style is so raw and wild. The way they skate is totally different than most of the people who skateboarding at that time. This group of skateboarders took the skateboarding culture to a whole another level and the world is trying to follow the way they skate. I think the most important thing that makes this movie good is Stacy Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams (which were the most famous skateboarder in the team) are involved in the movie and make everything so real.

I was in 7th grade math class when the buzz of Lords of Dogtown first came about. We were all about 13 at the time, and many of my classmates were in a huge rush to see it, and the ones who had would not stop raving about it. I missed the boat on catching this one in the theatre, and still to this day wish I would've had the theatre experience of this one. Truly one of the best movies I've ever watched or remembered. I'm not a skateboarder, but being a musician I can somewhat relate to the close knit skate community, just in a different sense. It followed really events for the time frame when the skate scene was just erupting onto the so cal area, and how the skaters are rushing to keep up with it and also make their mark. It follows their group troubles, friend and family troubles, adolescent troubles, all kinds of issues that are easy to relate or remember to all of us. If I was reading right, I also remember reading that this was based off of real skaters from the area at the time, which, if true, made this movie that much better. Also has a killer soundtrack.

It's fantastic seeing how some ""ordinary"" boys got the success following their passions and dreams without never giving up.
It's a lesson for everybody and they show that if you want something you have to go on until you'll get that.
Of course there's something more... the success can't come up overnight... they were training every single day until thei entered in the hall of fame.
This movie is for everyone... the lesson it teaches is how the life is, it doesn't matter the race, where you were born, the religion, or other... it's what you want and what you're willing to do to get that (in a legal way).
All the cast is great, the acting is astonishing... you feel yourself like you're with them.
The director is very good and I want to see more from her... I'm going to check out about other their movies as it's the first time I read her name.

","The only thing I came here to say after watching this movie repeatedly for a couple days is... the characters are a bunch of unkind, sassy, aloof bullies. I get that maybe that's what they are going for as it is kind of a rough town and therefore... but it's very tiresome, and the only one who didn't behave like an embittered child was the guy who played Stacy, he seemed like a sweet kid. The characters could be so much more than the sorta mean, goofy brat formula they all stick to. That alone makes the plot as weak and predictable as it is. But, I like the movie, because I find California in general fascinating, and it definitely takes you there. But I have a hard time liking the one-sided characters. Let me put it this way, almost EVERYONE in this movie is sort of an a-hole. It's hard to want to be a part of this group of, let me just say self-centered arrogant kids, I gave that up entirely by 8th grade. I like Hardwicke's Thirteen VERY much, but that was because there was a lot of emotion and substance to its plot, (and I love the California atmosphere throughout) and it was relatable. This movie isn't what I would call very relatable unless you're a skater or surfer with some kind of chip on your shoulder. But it is OK entertainment, and not too bad a movie. Nice to see Heath Ledger again. And it really brought to life how skating became as popular as it is, which was interesting."

","""Lords of Dogtown"" was a really great movie, it did a good job of telling the story of the Z-Boys and keeping the viewer interested in the movie. The acting was great and Heath Ledger was a good addition. As the movie progressed it got somewhat dry at portions, but picked back up. It was visually pleasing with great angles, and the whole look and demeanor of the characters really represented the movement of the time period. Overall I recommend this movie if you are a fan of skateboarding or biographical movies about popular culture figures. I rated 6 out of 10 just for the reason that there are portions of the movie that become slightly less interesting. Tony Hawk was a funny addition considering what he does. - Christian J."
"cherrybiossomgrl","9","6","21","30 October 2005"," An enjoyable movie for skaters and non-skaters alike.
","Most people probably think that they wouldn't enjoy this movie if they're not a skater - but this movie goes so beyond skateboarding that I think it's a shame it didn't do better than it did, and people won't give it a chance. It's a good idea to have seen ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" first, or at least have some knowledge about who these guys are, but this movie isn't just about the three ""lords"" of skateboarding - it's about friendship, brotherhood, breaking those bonds, and getting them back. It's about giving into greed, being there for your friends, and sticking to your roots - and the consequences of all those choices. While I'm not a skater myself, and find their partying a little out of control, it shines light on how life in late 70's California was for these young guys. Surprisingly, this movie was moving to me, and was sad when I saw the credits start to roll. This movie isn't for everyone, but if you have a minute interest in skateboarding and enjoy seeing people evolve, I highly recommend this movie."

","This is by far my favorite movie EVER. just the way these teens bond through stardom and the death of their friend, its moving. if anything this movie inspires many. when i saw this, i went out and bought a skateboard, and i learned how to skate. Jay Adams is definitely a hero of mine, along with the person who played him, Emile Hirsch. he portrays Jays attitude towards fame so well and victor did a great job showing how self centered and cocky tony got. they acted together brilliantly....a skateboarding classic, without a doubt. this movie is beyond unbelievable and i am so glad that stacy wrote it. and Catherine Hardwicke is a genius, and directed this beautifly and also thirteen which another one of my favorites."

","After several months of anticipation, I just saw this movie with my two sons. It was pretty much what I expected--overacting with some time line errors. Anyone who saw the documentary or grew up studying all the Skateboarder Magz from that era would know what I mean. Read Alva's 2nd Skateboarder interview (July 1978 issue) for the real account of how he got clocked in the eye. Also, Stacy was riding a Powell Peralta Brite Lite (just like mine!) in the Charlie's Angels scene, NOT one his G&S Warptail models (refer to Dogtown & Z-Boys). One more thing: I recall Alva stating in an interview that he is of Native American heritage, not Mexican (refer to Z-Boys.com). It seems to me that the producers were more about entertaining generations X,Y, &Z than trying to accurately depict history. Still, I enjoyed it a lot more than Star Wars IV."

Anyone who thought that this movie sucked because it didn't go into detail like the documentary and left a lot of stuff out TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT. I can see why they focused on these 3 skaters(Alva,Peralta,Adams)the way they did...ALva succeeded on his own terms...Peralta created his own legendary Skateboard Company that made a new generation of skaters famous...Tony Hawk being one of them...and the trials and tribulations of Adams...This movie made you care about these skaters where the Documentary focused on the sport itself.

","I understand why you might want to compare Lords of Dogtown to Peralta's documentary Dogtown and Z-boys, but I feel the need to point out that Lords of Dogtown is a movie, not a documentary. It's not the movie version of the documentary; it's simply a movie, and it should stand alone as one. That being said, I found it moving, artful, and entertaining. I grew up watching my brother's skateboard videos, and they never held my attention for long. I stumbled upon Lords of Dogtown while flipping through the channels and couldn't look away. The structure has been called too messy and abrupt, but that didn't bother me at all. It lent itself to the messy and abrupt turn of events in the lives of the boys, especially after their ""discovery."" The movie also took care to chronicle their emotional development while keeping its distance, which kept it from becoming sappy or contrived. The skateboarding clips were ""cool"" to me, and the acting was spectacular, especially Emile Hirsch. Heath Ledger was obviously asked to take his accent a little too far, but he was playing a pretty eccentric character. All in all, as a movie, it's fantastic."

Both of their characters are over the top, but dead on. Truth IS stranger than fiction folks.The pool skating scenes are awesome. I never was a fan of this sport until I saw this movie. This movie is based on a true story, and it is funny, sad, bold and heartbreaking.Many scenes were painstakingly recreated to take the audience back to the late 1970s. THe DelMar skate competition looked very realistic and captured the rowdiness and talent of the Z Boys. It reminded me of the Dead End Kids, with wheels."

The movie is based on a true story about the legendary z-boys. Jay Adams(Emile Hirsch), Stacy Peralta(John Robinson) and Tony Alva(Victor Rasuk) are very talented skaters and back at the 70, they changed the sport-world forever. I can't understand why the most of the people who seen this movie doesn't think it's great. Me and my friend (who I saw it with) laughed almost the whole movie. I loved the cool comments from ""Jay Adams"". And if you did not like it, then why comment it?

If you are expecting a serious movie but not really stern about the Dogtown and Z-boys, come see this. A thing that really broke my heart is at the end how Sid ends up having a tumor and dies. THis movie is basically about all of them at the beginning, Then Stacy, Then Jay, and Tony is has little ""crises'"" in between, but it feels like its more about Stacy Peralta, and Jay Adams. This movie's ""adult content"" Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought there was gonna be more ""smut"" and drugs and stuff but there wasn't I can only think of like three times where there like making and stuff.

"chas437","3","1","2","1 June 2019"," Just Mediocre
","In contrast to Peralta's superb 2001 documentary about the rise of skateboarding and the Zephyr team, this is an uninspired effort.<br/><br/>
This was an unnecessary project. The cast is mediocre to poor. This is Heath Ledger's worst role. Its also one of Catherine Hardwick's lesser directorial efforts. Its really not their fault. There is very little to work with here. Peralta wrote this poor screenplay, but I get the feeling he was getting pressure from above to make a lot of compromises.<br/><br/>
The end result is an aimless narrative that sells hip, cool and attitude. There's really no substance here. Its a shame."
"the_oak","8","1","2","11 October 2014"," Bad boys who were good on the bottom
","I was intrigued by the rawness of this movie. How the young boys lived for surfing, then turned to skate boarding when the new type of wheel was invented. It was touching to see how they struggled at home, how they found meaning in skating and in friend ship and having something together that was on the side of society. Then fame came, and I must say Jay, played by Emile Hirsch, was a bit intimidating. He didn't seem to give a damn, and I didn't like the way he stole Stacy's girlfriend, although I liked him better later in the movie, because he never gave in to fame and he never sold out. Late on in the movie we saw that things just turned out the way they had to, and that was comforting. In the end, the movie left me with a good feeling, even though one of them died from brain cancer. I really liked how Skip kept on making boards, but his shop being taken over by someone who knew how to run a business, and I liked the end scene, where the boys reunited in the empty swimming pool, grudges forgotten, just having a good time. It touched me, and I was left with a feeling that I had witnessed the birth of a new youth culture. We all know how trend setting it became and all that developed from it."
"imagiking","6","1","2","19 January 2011"," Lords of Dogtown: Sufficient
","The kind of person not even remotely enticed by the idea of a film about skateboarding, Lords of Dogtown was something I lazily opted to watch on television because of a name: Emile Hirsch in this case.<br/><br/>Exploring the shift in early-70s California from surfboards to skateboards, Lords of Dogtown follows primarily three young characters associated with the sport's beginnings. Recruited by local surf/skate shop owner Skip to his new team, the trio—along with others—begin to ascend the ranks and eventually find themselves besieged by offers from other, more financially appealing teams.<br/><br/>The opening credit sequence of Lords of Dogtown bears that most unfortunate of addendums: based on a true story. Such real life ensemble dramas are as rocky a territory as one can encounter in script terms, often only worthy of attention by those already interested in the subject matter. Such was my feeling as I began to watch this, the film focused, as you may well argue it should be, upon the skateboarding itself. Flittering glimpses of human drama are seen at various points: the splitting up of Jay's mother and her boyfriend; the relationship between Stacy and his girlfriend. These are mostly superfluous and perfunctory; surface skimming of something from which you feel the film could, and should, make more. This aside, the humour is plentiful, laughter making its presence felt regularly and appropriately. Be it the casual dismissiveness of Skip to his inner-ear-problem-besotted volunteer employee Sid, the scenes of manic teenage activity, or the athletic alacrity with which the characters throw themselves around the screen, the entertainment value is consistent for all. Problematic are the less friendly aspects of the team's wildness, such insignificant instances as their theft of an old man's hat and shouting vulgarities at nearby septuagenarians a deterrent factor in getting to like the characters. Nevertheless, they are at least partially endearing, their ascension an enjoyable spectacle. The film bears nothing of technical noteworthiness, save for some interesting shots from between the skateboard wheels as its respective riders take it for a test drive. An interesting concept, and one which perhaps might have benefited from some additional exploration. Hirsch's performance, it being my reason for sitting before the film, is amiable and solid, though undeniably outweighed by that of Ledger. An odd character is created between Ledger's drunken rants, meddlesome mischief, and disorganised handling of something which explodes beyond what he ever thought it might. Oddly handled to say the least, the performance elevates a background character to the foreground, bringing us to wonder what ever did become of Skip when the ending gives us—in rather frustrating text-over-still-image format we've seen so oft before—the future of these characters.<br/><br/>Despite portraying a subject in which I couldn't be less interested, Lords of Dogtown manages to keep things entertaining for most of its running time. Though it touches lightly upon a number of subjects without ever exploring any of them particularly deeply, the central and simple friendship story at its heart is sufficient to warrant its watching, being as it is more the kind of thing you watch when it happens to come on than one you actively seek out."

","I'm really sorry, but after reading the comment that was written by 'peterstrauss' I really felt like smashing my head against a wall just because it was written in such ignorance. True: it's not a movie the mass is used to see, but that's really not a reason to discard it as 'BAD'. Or however you Americans say it. It's merely a reason to open your eyes to see another level of movie making. Not every movie has to be a copy of another movie. And there are a lot of them around. Her other movie he commented on (Thirteen) isn't a bad movie. It just shows another world in movie making. Lords of Dogtown and Thirteen are beautiful movies and I really have respect for the way they were made. <br/><br/>And by the way, 'peterstrauss':<br/><br/>The camera moves and editing on both weren't choppy; they were meant to be like that. No movie is made with a director that doesn't know what he or she is doing! It's just the way people look at it and instantly make a opinion about it. While you think of it as choppy other peeps think of it as art. Making movies isn't about giving the big public what they want, it's about giving them something to think and (usually) learn about. <br/><br/>Well; excuse my bad English in some parts, but I really thought this had to be said. If movies were all alike there wouldn't be any reason anymore to watch and make them."
"lifehouse37","10","4","18","3 June 2005"," An Excellent Addition to the Documentary
","That whole deal from the unemployed critic is bogus. Don't listen to him. This movie was excellent and the points he touches on are complete crap. I think that creating the documentary into an actual feature film was a great idea. In my mind, it turned out excellent and did a stupendous job portraying the whole image of the z-boys. There may be some aspects that were not reached but it does not show through in this movie. Peralta did write the screenplay so it is kind of hard to argue with that. Touching on the whole camera work of this movie, I think it was wonderful. There was a wide variety of moving camera angles and more zoom like schemes. I really like the moving camera. It makes the action seem so much more realistic and in-your-face. It is really hard to film skateboarding while moving yourself (I know from experience) and the filmers in his movie did a satisfactory job of that. The set for this movie was remarkably realistic of it's era. The crew had to completely recreate The Zephyr Shop, P.O.P Pier and the streets of Venice in the seventies and if you watch the documentary or other footage from that area in that era and compare, you'll see near perfect results. I enjoyed that aspect. Also, the costume design and stuff is pretty accurate. The soundtrack for ""Lords"" was off the walls, with some good beats from the sixties and seventies. The skating was real enjoyable in this movie. Heck, Alva and Peralta were their own stunt doubles. The seventies is probably my favorite era of skateboarding and it was really cool being able to see it recreated on the silver screen. The documentary shows actual footage from then and I like how this movie was able to resurrect that style and skill. On a conclusive note, you really gotta get out and see ""Lords of Dogtown"". It was really amazing how well it turned out, especially having the pressure of following ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"", the documentary."

And once watched, you get the feeling that you're in the 70's. The movie and the director create a really good atmosphere for the movie.

It is the characteristics of the three main characters that standout, even if, they acting are not that good.<br/><br/>The story is entertaining but the way they friendship fell apart it is way way too brief and can be confusing. But the ending is pretty good but I'm not really sure if everyone will like it.

","Catherine Hardwicke totally had me with her film 13, and she's done it again with Dogtown. I am not a skate fan and I have not seen the documentary 30 times, but I loved this film for it's humor and characters. The 70's are so perfectly recreated through the music, the clothes, the locations, down to the particular way a barrette sits in a girl's hair- more accurate than even Virgin Suicides. The Boyz, the actors have amazing chemistry and their relationship with the slightly older skate shop owners is very true to life, how they admire them even though they act like brats most of the time. I was definitely crying at the end of the film because I was so moved by the relationships and the complexity of all that had gone on through their lives as they realized their destinies.<br/><br/>There were parts of the film which I felt moved a little slow, but overall I thought the pacing was great. The use of montage was very connected to the subject matter- although not overly stylized, somehow they had a very connected, very 70's feel. The music combined with beautifully shot and put together sequences of skating, living, progressing had a great motion that made me feel like I had been there, even though I was too young to remember anything from that era- a very special deja vu. <br/><br/>Lots of laughs, excellent character development and acting in Jay Adams and Skip, and some very nice supporting roles. A standout to me is the extremely lovable America Fererra, star of Real Women Have Curves, who plays a friend of Tony Alva's sister. Although she a very small yet adorable little part, Hardwicke manages to develop her character in a very subtle and unique way right through the end crawl of the film."

I know little to nothing about skateboarding. I have a skateboard, but I hardly use it.<br/><br/>That movie had a few unknown actors in it as the main characters. The real guys who these characters were based on appeared in the film too. I thought that was pretty cool. Also, you can never go wrong with Johnny Knoxville and Tony Hawk. Emille Hirsh did a pretty good job here too. I didn't think much of his performance in The Girl Next Door, but here he really shines. And, it's about time we see Rebecca De Mornay in movies again.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger was the biggest surprise to me. I didn't even recognize him until after the movie was over. I hadn't paid much attention to the beginning credits. Heath Ledger is definitely one of the best character actors for the new generation. I think he will definitely have a long career in acting.<br/><br/>Although the movie has some intense scenes, I would say that it is basically a feel good film. I hope the director isn't upset that I think that way about it :) Anyway, I give a thumbs up to ""Lords of Dogtown"""

","THIS IS A MOVIE! And a great one at that.<br/><br/>People have to stop comparing it to the doc, because they are very different things! If you compare this to the doc, then you have to compare every movie that was ever adapted to its original source material. It's one thing to list the differences, but it's crazy to tell people not to see a movie because of the differences. When was the last time you heard a critic (which can be anybody) say, ""...that film was nothing like the book. You should read the book instead."" If people really think like that, then they should treat each film the same.<br/><br/>You have to remember, THIS IS A MOVIE, based on reality. That means that some of it will be FICTION. With most films, people should be entertained. Ms. Hardwicke does a great job of entertaining the audience and staying true to the source material. Obviously, she can't cover every single skater that was introduced in the documentary, but she does give them a presence while dedicating the film to Dogtown's three most recognizable skaters.<br/><br/>People should give this movie a chance, and allow themselves to be taken on a fun ride. It's a cool film that isn't just for skateboarders (which I am not), just like ""RAGING BULL"" isn't just for boxers.<br/><br/>Allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised."
"Rushie","10","3","15","6 June 2005"," Movie is Great Emotional Behind-The-Scenes
","I am not writing this to pretend to be some kind of ""film"" critic, but just saw the movie and wanted to share my opinion with others who might not see it based on it's subject matter. I am from the Midwest, not real familiar with the ""skate scene"" in California at all. I ended up moving to California, marrying a former skater and have amassed a huge amount of knowledge regarding the time and scene and the huge cast of characters. <br/><br/>The documentary of Dogtown and Z Boys was really interesting but the movie was focusing on something that wasn't really covered in the documentary. The emotional situations that were occurring during that time, to see their friendships and how they prevailed with the stress and strain that immediate fame and fortune would or would not bring (in Jay's case). To see the emotional toll that the times took on these young people, and in Skip's case, not so young people. <br/><br/>I found it completely intriguing and couldn't wait for the movie to come out. Now I just can't wait for the DVD to see the extra features! I found it almost voyeuristic in that you were seeing what a piece of that life would have been like. I found that they did such a realistic job of putting it all together and making you feel as though you are watching those exact events take place. Amazingly fun and exciting and the only time I've been in a theater full of 6-15 yr olds and not heard a word uttered through the entire thing! <br/><br/>Great movie, great fun and definitely worth the price of admission and more!!"
"VinceRocca","10","3","15","4 June 2005"," Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar
","Heath Ledger's performance in Lords is not only Oscar worthy, but so far he deserves the win. Not since Johnny Deps performance as Captain Jack Sparrow has anyone deserved an Oscar more. Too bad those stuffed shirts at the academy probably won't recognize a skate flick for contention.<br/><br/>Lords of Dogtown is beautifully shot, (something that will probably also be overlooked because it's a skate movie). The movie is filled with an eccentric mix of interesting shots like after the pier burns down, to gritty documentary shots like the bowl riding.<br/><br/>The movie shows the real word of skating. Not the watered-down PG-ified version ESPN gives us. Lords shows the rebellious punk scene that skating was (and sometimes still is). At some points the movie hits uncomfortable lows that reminded me of past life moments I'd like to forget. It doesn't show an all around positive skate image, but that's because it's a Docudrama, and like most Documentaries or Docudramas there are parts we agree with, and parts we don't, but none-the-less as with any good movie we are entertained.<br/><br/>The closing credits list Stacy Peralta as a successful film maker. While he does have some credits to his name, if Lords were his only credit, he'd still be considered successful, because to pull this movie together alone shows lots of talent."
"jordyjordz","10","3","16","29 January 2006"," one of those movies you are glad you have watched
","I thought this movie was absolutely fantastic, in my personal opinion, anyone who thought differently must have either a.) fallen asleep through the whole movie or b.) doesn't have a functioning brain. For a movie based on a true story about skateboarding in the 70's, they could not have done it any better, the storyline, the filming itself was superb. One of the better movies i have seen in a long time. The special features on the DVD actually has a making of the movie, and it shows how the actors had to start of skateboarding from scratch because they are riding on boards that are basically a dead language and it also shows all the original people that the movie was based upon. It's well worth watching and u would be sorry if u missed out on hiring it or buying it."

","I love this film because it is a true story with roots deep and raw. The story is playful, heartbreaking, and inspiring. You should definitely go see it. The characters are well developed and Heath Ledger gives the most amazing performance. He is identical to the real Skip Engblom. The Z Boys are a cool, laid back group despite their fame and success. The Lords of Dogtown is one of the most meaningful films I have seen surface from the depths of Hollywood in a long time. I think it hits home for a lot of people. I definitely related to the story and felt inspired after leaving. I like it! I love it! It is fantastic! I can't recommend this movie enough."
"el_dirko","8","3","16","3 June 2005"," My opinion
","As a skateboarder myself I felt obligated to see the roots of my sport and to compare to my report on skateboarding. And to my surprise i was very pleased with this movie. I felt the movie was a great depiction of the story of Dogtown. It went right along with the information in my report as well. It is a well done movie showing how a couple of kids from California changed skateboarding. Leaveing nothing out, it shows about the lives of the boarders and it shows the personalities of the guys which explains the decisions they make.The actors do a great job in portraying the kids. Heath Ledger plays an excellent drunk man. I recommend this movie for anyone who skates so they can see what skating is really about and for anyone who just wants to see a good movie."
"Quinoa1984","6","2","9","6 November 2006"," passable enough for a easy-going afternoon, but less than outstanding entertainment
","Maybe I'm a little jaded from Lords of Dogtown following the documentary Dogtown & Z-Boys, and maybe my interest in the film is compounded by the fact that I'm not that heavy into skateboarders- even ones that can do some incredible things like the Z-Boys. But the film here, which has some moments of fine humor and edge and even a little drama, isn't something I would outright recommend unless you already know what you're getting into. For example, if you're the kind of person, male or female (though probably male as, for the most part, it is a male-dominated activity), that shops often at the VANS store, or own many Tony Hawk video games, this is the film event of the year. But for the casual observer of the sport, reactions may vary. The drama, of what is there, doesn't totally pick up mainly until the latter part of the film as the Z-Boys start to gain more notoriety with their shake-up of the skateboarding world. <br/><br/>From what I remember seeing, much of the film is set among guys- some very famous future skaters like Stacy (John Robinson) and Jay (Emile Hirsch, who does make an impression with his longish blonde hair and cool demeanor)- who hang out a lot, and try to one-up each other with their 'moves', mostly in swimming pools they sneak into and other grungy places in 1970s surf-side California. Some of these scenes are really funny; I particularly liked Heath Ledger (somewhat unrecognizable) as the head of a skater-shop named Skip. But a lot of this is also a bit aimless, even as it has a quasi-organizing principle. As a much stronger storytelling/visual stroke was in the documentary, director Catherine Hardwicke just tries to make it as 'docu-drama' as possible, with more attitude than real characterization, and sometimes scenes that come off TOO improvised, if that's possible. Not a bad film in the slightest, and if it's ever a pretty mellow day with some friends who are more into the high-stakes, big-game skater world than I, I'd watch it again. It's just that it doesn't necessarily work either as an affecting tale of a small revolution with the youth in the 70s."
"applid","8","3","17","31 December 2005"," A journey that goes beyond those on wheels
","I think the former commentator's comment on this film is unfair. The story told in this picture doesn't seem to reach up to carmex1391's expectations -- this is not a two hour skate video, and I think that rebuking a film purely on personal expectations is unfair. For those who'd prefer a documentary on the same subject, I suggest you watch Dogtown and Z-boys (2001) instead, directed by Stacy Peralta.<br/><br/>What I think, though, is that this is an excellent and powerful film celebrating the founders of modern skateboarding. Put into a motion picture drama, I enjoyed every minute of it, especially since it doesn't completely focus on skateboarding skills. It covers nearly every (professional) move the original characters made during the early years all the way up to when the group dissolved. The film includes aspects of surfing, skating, competitions, fame, love, greed, hate, visions, and even death. And as a plus, it has a really good soundtrack.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys boards, good music, fine directing and editing, and isn't afraid of experiencing potential emotional flashbacks.<br/><br/>/Joe"

It's about a group of kids in Venice California who just hang out and surf and skate. Their not rich snobs and they just chill and go to party's. Their hooked on surfing, skating, and supporting their families. The owner of their hangout shop starts a skate team and they go there and totally control the competition. There's fights and breakups , but the ending just brings them back together. The ending is really sad, but it ends up bringing the whole group back together.

Emile Hirsch as Jay Adams was enrapturing as he tried to keep up with the others and find his place in life. The competition between Alva and Peralta is for the most part almost subliminal and keeps your attention well.<br/><br/>The best part is the Boogie Nights-esquire rise and fall of the characters as they grow up and change.<br/><br/>This movie was a complete surprise for an unbeliever and and it can sure as hell surprise you too."

","I saw this movie by mistake, I was looking for Añpha Dog and ended up with this one instead but it was a very pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>I learned, through my many film-maniac years, that if a movie is ""based on a true story"" it means the names of actual people have been included in a very incredible -and I mean this literally- story, loosely based on their actual lives (or periods of it). They try the put the most important facts into one quick concocted story, no paying attention to the connecting items of the story. 'Lord of Dogtown' differs immensely from that, I cannot but praise it. Most movies need a narrator to express the feelings you can see in this story and through the boys' acting. The story is understood in its whole sense; from the boys desire to have fun to the actual need to accomplish something. <br/><br/>This movie can be recommended above all because of the story itself, whether or not it's the ACTUAL story."

","A great movie. Appreciated by even the people the movie is about, as evidenced by the fact that they were all in it. Everybody from Tony Alva to Skip Engblom has a part in this movie. The detail gone into was incredible, some of the Z-Boys are quoted as saying that walking onto the sets was like stepping back in time. The acting was good, and the skating was spectacular. Written in part by Stacy Peralta, the same filmmaker responsible for Dogtown and Z-Boys, this movie is historically accurate, wildly entertaining, and is incredible in the way that it seems to never get old. It's one of the few movies I can watch even though I've seen it fifty times. It gets the strongest recommendation I can offer, although I do suggest watching Dogtown and Z-Boys first. There's a lot of overlap in the movies, and knowing what you learn from Dogtown and Z-Boys makes Lords of Dogtown that much better."

","Why are there always these self proclaimed critics like the unemployed critic who strive to form everyone's opinion. No room is left for freedom of choice in making up one's own mind. IT'S AS IF THE CRITIC IS AN EXPERT ABOUT ANYTHING, WHICH IS SO FAR FROM THE THE TRUTH AS TO BE LUDICROUS. His/her opinion is just another breath of hot air which usually appeals to people who already think that way,not someone who is a freethinker. If the critic could just step back and hear how closed minded they sounded they would be shocked-that is if they were not so close minded. I can't believe the vitriolic attitude of the critic. I personally loved Thirteen for it's honest and realistic portrayal of teenagers. It broke new cinematic ground in form and content with it's innovative use of the camera and editing style. Take this and integrate it with a Cassevettes approach to acting and you truly have something unique and affecting-that is if you can look at a piece of work with a truly open mind. Perhaps this is something the unemployed critic could work on. As far as Lord's of Dogtown goes I see this as a continuation of Catherine Hardwicke's artistic explorations balanced with the commercial expectations of the studio world. Having seen the movie at it's premiere and witnessing the audience reaction i would say she was overwhelmingly successful. She is a highly talented and artful director with great respect for her actors and material. She does continue her explorations that she started with Thirteen and for me that is exactly what she should be doing. It's a positive direction and i for one hopes she takes it further. Lords of Dogtown is exciting and faithful to it's material. It is very ambitious and doesn't let up for second. It has all the energy that it can handle, breathing the essence of the young boys.The whole film taken in it's entirety is like one big skateboard ride hardly allowing you to catch your breath.Just think,this is what it must have been like for these young guys in the 70's trying to escape their ghetto and make something of themselves the only way the only way they knew how, with their talent.LORDS OF DOGTOWN IS NOT DOGTOWN AND THE Z BOYS.It is based on it and in some ways it is better. It's up to the moviegoer to make up their own minds, don't let people who obviously have their own agendas do it for you."

Tonight I am thumbing through my old Skateboarder magazines and I still have the Jay Allen interview at 15 as well as some Alva and Dog town articles. This movie really caught the rebellious feeling of the day as well as the pioneering spirit that these guys had. They were in the right place at the right time. If you are 38-50 and were a skater in the 70s, you will Definitely feel this movie and its sound track. I also love how Jay Allen goes punk (like I did).

"gradyharp","8","2","12","9 May 2006"," History as a Mood Piece
","There is not a whole lot of story to the cinematic adaptation of Stacy Peralta's memoir of his experience in the mid 1970s with the popularization of skateboarding. Nor is there a whole lot of character development in these teenagers addicted to skateboarding among other things. But what LORDS OF DOGTOWN is, is a spectacular cinematic excursion into the risks and exaltations of the sport of championship skateboarding: watching the thrills of these kids doing dangerous leaps, twists, airborne stunts in empty swimming pools is truly entertaining.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1975 when surfing was all the rage, especially in Venice, CA where one Skip (Heath Ledger) owns a surfboard shop. He befriends a scrappy bunch of teenagers who live their lives for skateboarding along Venice Beach and in private homes where empty swimming pools (this was the era of water conservation!) provide provocative arenas for their skills. The lead among them is Jay (Emile Hirsch) who is out to explore new challenges and when he and his confrères Stacy (John Robinson), Tony (Victor Rusak), and Sid (Michael Angarano) demonstrate the way skateboarding pleases crowds and girls, Skip cashes in on the enterprise by forming Zephyr, a club for championship skateboarding and enters his groupie into the competition circuit. As the boys gain fame they are tempted away from Skip into higher profile gigs and the group disintegrates only to reform after a tragedy befalls one of them.<br/><br/>The screenplay was written by Stacy Peralta (and that may explain why his role is a bit too goodie-two-shoes when compared to the antics of the other boys) and while there isn't a lot of dialogue of significance, there is a lot of communication very much in tune with the historic time of the action. Catherine Hardwicke has an amazing sense of the teenage attitude and vulnerability and keeps the story 'skating' with staggering momentum. The cast is uniformly fine: Heath Ledger shows he can be something other than the Hollywood leading man type and Emile Hirsch, Victor Rusak, and John Robinson are all on target with their roles. Newcomer Michael Angarano shows the promise in this film that resulted in his superb role in the current 'One Last Thing' - his screen presence is magnetic.<br/><br/>In all this is a recreation of a wild period of life in a bizarre era staged in a rickety old version of Venice, CA and it gives the viewer a slice of atmosphere that will likely not be re-created as well.

"jmitch77","8","2","12","28 January 2006"," Unrated much better than theatrical
","First and foremost this movie is much better while watching the unrated version rather than the theatrical version. The main cast includes, Heath Ledger(Skip), Emil Hersch(Jay), Viktor Rasuk(Tony) ,and John Robinson(Stacy). Cathrine Hardwicke directed lords and it Stacy Peralta(original Z boy and director) wrote the screenplay. This is a story version of some of the forefathers of modern skating. The z-boys revolutionized skateboarding with there aggressive style and attitude. Cathrine Hardwicke does a great job of taking maybe 10 years and combining them into 2 or 3. The unrated version of lords shows all the stuff that woulda help make it the movie it should have been. The dialogue is better to say the least. A couple of the major flaws in Lords is the fact that many years had to be crammed into a short few. You aren't able to delve as deep into some of the characters stories as you might like. In my case some of the other z boys stories. Stacy, Jay, and Tony are clearly the best and most exciting but it would be nice to know more about the others. The Stars of this movie were the killer soundtrack, Heath ledger, and Emil Hersch. The soundtrack had the sound of Venice California in the 70's and was a integral part of the movie. Heath was absolutely amazing as skip. His feeling as a drunk surfer with more things on his plate than he knew what to do with was perfect. He did enough to cement himself in the industry for at least another decade or two. Emil Hersch portrayed Jay Adams as most people could have wanted him to. You got more emotion and feeling from his eyes than from his dialect in some instances. He is a rising actor that will be a great actor of the future. Lords of Dogtown did enough to satisfy the skate crowd and the masses. The acting and soundtrack does enough to keep people watching."

","I mainly enjoyed this film due to standout performances by both Heath Ledger and Emile Hirsch. I'll admit that I haven't seen a whole bunch of Heath Ledger flicks (none of them ever looked that interesting to me) but based on what I've seen this film is a huge step forward for him. His character provided some of the most moving scenes in the film. The scene towards the end of the film where he's in the back of the shop shaping the board was particularly well executed. I also enjoyed the scene that he and Emile Hirsch shared in the pier. Which takes me right to my next point. Emile Hirsch was good in ""The Emporer's Club"" and he cracked me up in ""The Girl Next Door"" but this is the first film that I've really taken him seriously in. He really gets inside of his character and does a great job conveying the intensity of Jay Adams' determination not to sell out. The movie itself drags a bit in place but it's mainly well done and has a few visually affecting shots. That, combined with two great performances, makes it worth seeing."

The character of Jay Adams is amazing. I would have liked to know more about him. His three friends are Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta and Sid. Tony is this ego maniac and loves to show off. He is competitive and tries to beat anyone in his way. The movie goes on as Tony, Jay and Stacy split. Tony and Stacy go into competitive sporting, while Jay skates for the thrill and fun of it while trying to support him and his mother. There is a love triangle between Jay, Stacy and Tony's sister, Kathy. Kathy likes Stacy but Stacy is driven and ambitious, too serious for Kathy. Jay steps in and she goes wild for him. (I don't blame her.) In the end, Sid, who is a tag along to Jay, gets cancer. He has a tumor, which brings together these separate friends. Stacy, Tony, and Jay all come back for one last visit.<br/><br/>In the long run this movie was awesome. The Z-Boys were wonderfully portrayed.

"meger_7","7","2","14","10 June 2005"," Skating ecstasy
","Creating a feature film on radical sports like surfing and skateboarding is no easy task, which is why you see most of those filmmakers settle on documentaries. But, every now and then a filmmaker will get an idea and put it to a test as a feature film. That's what writer/director John Stockwell did with BLUE CRUSH a few years ago and I think I remember it fairing quite well. The harsh truth to movies like BLUE CRUSH and now LORDS OF DOGTOWN is there's simply not enough of them. Maybe if more feature films were made instead of documentaries in this genre, the quality would be better, but when all we have to compare it to is some extreme documentary with 'alternative' music, it's hard to look past the action and see the story taking place. And, I think that's what many critics will do with LORDS OF DOGTOWN, the new skating/surfing film by writer Stacy Peralta who also just happens to be one of the famed ""Z-Boys"" himself, the same group featured in the film.<br/><br/>The story in LORDS OF DOGTOWN is all about the Z-Boys, who were Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) and Stacy Peralta (John Robinson) and the mark they made on the sport of skateboarding. Starting out, the Z-Boys were just boys wanting to be surfers like the other locals in Venice, Calif., who had reigned in every piece of the sport. The leader and guy the Z-Boys looked up to was Skip Engblom (Heath Ledger), owner of the Zephyr surf shop where the whole gang hung out from time to time. It was the 70s and all they had then was pretty much surfing, but one day Skip was handed some new ""in-line"" skateboarding wheels to test out that would eventually turn his and the newly dubbed Z-Boys' world around. The next thing you know, the Z-Boys are turning crazy moves on their skateboards in drained swimming pools (or what they called a wave that never breaks) and competitions, starting a skating craze across the country. And, with this kind of success comes money, fame and girls, all of which that can test the very best of friendships. In the end, however, it was all about the skating, leaving a question of whether or not that was enough to keep the trio together? I'm not sure how closely the cast modeled the original Z-Boys, but with Stacy Peralta involved, I can only imagine he did his best. And really, the cast in this one was great, lead by none other than Heath Ledger, who I must say was impressive as Skip. Ledger, who played a convincing drunk the entire film, did not overpower the rest of the cast. If anything, he took a backseat, which is exactly what director Catherine Hardwicke wanted. The rest of the cast was chosen well and seemed to feed off each other quite nicely. The one-standout performance is my mind though was Emile Hirsch (THE GIRL NEXT DOOR), who in my mind had the toughest role to play in Jay Adams. Hirsch's character probably had the most talent, but chose a separate road without the fame and fortune. This created much emotion and struggles, played very nicely by Hirsch.<br/><br/>It almost goes without saying that the action and extreme camera-work was top notch in LORDS OF DOGTOWN. For anyone who has seen a surfing documentary, you already know how this camera-work plays out, but for those of you who haven't seen it before, get ready to be taken on a wild ride. Having already done the famed documentary DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS, I'm almost positive Stacey Peralta had a lot to say about how certain skating scenes should go. In fact, it was said that the real Tony Alva helped Peralta and Hardwicke choreograph several of the scenes, showing the young actors how the Z-Boys should skate and act.<br/><br/>But, it wasn't as much skating, as it was the balance of the story with it, which is where Harwicke shines. She has a way of bringing out as much emotion as possible, and it worked really well in this film. That balance only fueled the action taking place, leaving you to watch and wonder what extreme act would happen next. Many critics see this story as weak, but how powerful of a story do you need for a group of famous skaters? The pure drama of their lives is enough for me to enjoy and take in, which I believe is all Peralta wanted in the end.<br/><br/>LORDS OF DOGTOWN definitely isn't for everyone, but I would think anyone that has the least bit interest in surfing or skating will enjoy and appreciate the true essence of this story. It's hard not to love extreme skating and surfing, but when it's shot under the watchful eye of two of the Z-Boys themselves, it can't get much better than that. But, this movie was more than just a showcase for skating, it was a drama and I personally feel director Catherine Hardwicke (THIRTEEN) did an excellent job in showing the emotional struggles these so-called ""Z-Boys"" went through while revolutionizing the sport of skateboarding in the 70s.<br/><br/>B+"
"emswife","8","2","14","8 June 2005"," I think it was great except...
","The movie ""Lords of Dogtown"" was a create depiction of an era when surf met cement and egos abounded in a world where slackers ruled and having a job wasn't what anyone in their right mind wanted to do. It was the mid to late 70's and SoCal hip was in along with a bunch of scraggly no name kids who set the skateboarding world on it's ear.<br/><br/>Without Alva, Adams, Peralta, the rest of the Zephyr team and their mentors, Ho, Engblom and company, the world wouldn't even care about who Tony Hawk is... in fact, if it weren't for Stacy Peralta, Tony Hawk might have been a never was.<br/><br/>My only problem with this film is the character of Sid. Why was it necessary to make up this character from thin air? Yes, there was a rich kid with cancer who's dad drained to pool and turned it into the DogBowl but his name was Gino and he wasn't a member of the Z-boys. He was just a rich kid with a pool and a place for the crew to hang. With so much in the way of reality, I just don't get it. Why make up Sid? There weren't enough stories? I would like to have seen a little more about the rest of the team and a little less about a person who never existed.<br/><br/>Other than that, having watched and now owing the first Stacy Peralta effort that documents the scene called ""Dog Town and Z Boys"", I think this is a perfect companion piece. It is what it was then... when hangin' was really cool, music was honest and chicks were... well they could skate and look good and not be on a disco roller rink floor.<br/><br/>Bravo to this flick... but next time, stick with reality. It is always better than fiction!"

The guys are definitely hot and you don't even have to be a fan or know much about skateboarding and surfing to totally like and understand this movie! I really liked the characters of Stacy and Jay, and Heath Ledger amazed me, he did a really great job. It kept me entertained the entire time, and it wasn't any sort of downer, which is what i was afraid of. there wasn't a lot of emphasis on drugs or sex which is what can really ruin a movie for me.

","Rebecca De Mornay was very good in this movie about some skaters in Venice! I knew Stacey Peralta (not a Mexican) was a good skater, but not this good!! Rebecca De Mornay was the mother of the vato skater named Jay. I always thought Rebecca De Mornay's son was going to stick to skating but he didn't. He got involved in gangs for some silly reason. Rebecca De Mornay was sure swanky looking in this movie as the Crystal meth addicted mother of Jay. However, Rebecca De Mornay did deliver the goods.<br/><br/>The best scene was whew Tony hit that one guy in the face. Rebecca De Mornay was not in that scene.<br/><br/>I just hope that nobody decides to try and skate too much these days because it's just so dangerous when you try to do too many tricks.<br/><br/>Look out for cameos by Tony Falcon and Eddie Van Halan."

","A few months back I rented Stacy Paralta's acclaimed documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"". While I myself am not an avid skateboarder, my love of the cinema and for counter-culture led me directly to this work. I was immediately drawn into the world of skateboarding as created by Skip Engblom's motley crew of surfer/skaters.<br/><br/>That's the factual history of skateboarding and the Zephyr team.<br/><br/>For a dramatized and entertaining account, see what I have dubbed ""Stand By Me on acid"".<br/><br/>Strong performances from the leads and certain supporting players are the main highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger finally impresses me as the seemingly always wasted Skip. Emile Hirsch, breaking what could have been a type-cast career by playing a bad-ass was the stand-out as troubled Jay Adams. And Rebecca De Mornay stole most of the scenes she was in as Adams' even more troubled mom.<br/><br/>My only real negative critique of the film is that the direction lacked the necessary focus. There were times when it felt like I was listening to a 5 year old describe ""Crime and Punishment"". Catherine Hardwicke was not the right choice, though a decent enough one to not let this film completely fail. The cast and crew were able to make up for her lack of direction and then some.<br/><br/>Overall though, as film, I give it an 8 out of 10 and has placed 4th in my current list of the top 20 films of 2005 (behind 1-Sin City, 2-Kingdom of Heaven, 3-Crash)."

Although it is sugarcoated in Hollywood gloss, i thought it had enough honesty to be realistic. OK, i've never met the z-boyz but i thought that through the acting, i had a good enough feel to appreciate what the film was getting at, whatever that may have been. When watching it with three friends of mine, i asked them, okay so who's your favourite, and most people agreed with me on this order: jay (<3) skip, Sid, Stacy and then tony. i thought that jay did a really good job and had a lot of energy, that even when he didn't have lines,, he was still doing some weird twitch or movement that i think would have been true to the real jay. SKip, ah skip, ah heath, OK we all loved the talking. the slur and americanness was fabulous. there wasn't a trace of Aussie in him, and i often forgot it was heath, although brokeback mountain was great, and everybody loved 10 things i hate about you, i still feel like heath was outside of his element in this. As for the rest, the acting was all right, there were a few faulty mishaps where line delivery wasn't great, but otherwise, i actually found this movie really captivating, and yes, it made me want to pick up the skateboard thats been sitting in my room for ages and go outside, and make an ass of myself."
"eht5y","8","2","15","1 October 2005"," A Gnarly Nostalgia Trip
","'Lords of Dogtown' ain't 'Citizen Kane,' but it's a hell of a lot of fun--a gnarly nostalgia trip for aging skaters, and a relatable time-capsule for the current generation of asphalt wave riders.<br/><br/>After seeing Stacy Peralta's 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' documentary, it might be easy to write off 'Lords of Dogtown' as an unnecessary exercise, and it's certainly true that much of the 'history' of the Zephyr team and its impact on skateboarding's transition from a trivial novelty to a cultural phenomenon and an elite 'extreme' sport is glossed over in this film. But it's a mistake to compare the two: 'Lords of Dogtown' isn't meant to be a faithful history of the rise of skateboarding in Venice, but, rather, a narrative about three friends whose shared love of getting stoked on wheels and waves took them places they could never have imagined.<br/><br/>No doubt, the film has an air of hero worship. It's easy to see from the special features and director's commentary that, at heart, Catherine Hardwick is still a true-blue surf-and-skate Betty, and is still totally in love with the idealized image of skinny, shirtless, long-haired boys who party hard, raise hell, and ditch school to chase waves. 'Lords of Dogtown' is, more than anything else, another 'Endless Summer' or 'Big Wednesday,' made a little more thrilling by the fact that it's pretty much a true story.<br/><br/>What makes the film most appealing is watching the three leads going through familiar adolescent trials along with more personally difficult experiences. Tony Alva (Victor Raskub)--the sport's first great showman--is driven to prove himself by a fear of inadequacy largely driven by the prejudice he suffers as a Mexican-American. Peralta (John Robinson)--who went on to become one of the sport's most beloved stars and its most successful businessman (he is also the screenwriter for the film)--is drawn as the nice kid who is somewhat ostracized by his tougher, more defiant friends for such sins as wearing a watch, holding down a steady job, and occasionally attempting to get to school on time, but his real crisis is realizing how different he is from his friends and how much more pronounced those differences become as they grow older. But the film's heart is Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch), who may very well have been the most gifted of the three but whose emotional wounds and defiant spirit prevented him from taking advantage of the same opportunities that propelled Peralta and Alva to wealth and stardom. <br/><br/>The three young actors are mostly superb. Raskub is probably the weakest--he is given the least room to develop Alva as more than hotheaded, insecure, and ego-driven--but he's appealing and a lot of fun to watch, and he's persuasively athletic. Robinson is a bit of a blank slate (given that the real Stacy Peralta wrote the story, it's not surprising that his character seems more the observer than the participant), but he's a warm presence and the concern and empathy he feels for his friends is obvious. Emile Hirsch is the best, and has the most complex role. He carries it off well; his transformation from Z-boy to Chicano hoodlum seems abrupt, but that owes more to flaws in pacing and direction than to weakness in the performance. Indeed, the most obvious technical flaw of the film is its pacing--the passage of time is hard to mark; the transitions which take place in the boys' lives happen rather suddenly, and changes in their circumstances--the abandonment of the Zephyr team by its stars, Engblom's apparent decline into alcoholism, Peralta's and Alva's rise to stardom and Adams' retreat from it--all seem a little random and disorganized.<br/><br/>If there is any thematic flaw to the film, it may be that Hardwicke's affection for the by-gone heyday of the mid-'70s overwhelms some of the harsh realities of her story. But the film is redeemed by its worship of the cult of skating and wave riding. When the three friends regroup for pool sessions at the home of their old friend Sid (who seems to be the movie's source of comic relief until he is felled by a brain tumor and left confined to a wheel-chair), the common love and the freedom they share carving around the big blue bowl is absolutely persuasive. I haven't been on a board in ten years, but I felt my heart quicken as if I were back there again, with friends I've long-since lost touch with, caring about nothing more than the sheer joy of pulling off a killer trick or catching the fleeting sense of weightlessness getting vertical. The cinematography is occasionally a bit shaky, but the 'skate-cam' shots (which were done by Bones Brigade legend Lance Mountain) are sublime, and the superb soundtrack of classic rock keeps the adrenalin flowing. The biggest irony, of course, is that the moves being pulled off by the Z-boys which were so unbelievably radical back in 1975 are so basic today thanks to years of advances in technique and board, truck, and wheel technology that it's kind of funny watching people cheer for stuff that wouldn't raise an eyebrow at a modern skate competition. But comparing Tony Alva to Tony Hawk is like comparing Babe Ruth to Barry Bonds (except that Tony Hawk isn't a huge jerk).<br/><br/>Many have criticized this film for neglecting to include all of the original Z-boys in its story, but there are far too many of the original Dogtown old-schoolers making cameos in the film to think that it bothered them too much to see the story revolve around Alva, Adams, and Peralta (all three of whom have quick cameos--a few second-generation skaters are there as well, including Christian Hosoi and, of course, the great Tony Hawk in a hilariously self-effacing appearance)."

","I LOVED it-- especially how it came out at the end. I was incredibly involved in it by then, & all the characters were amazing as it developed. Even though I'm in North Cali now, I'm was born in Orange County hospital in '71 & spent hell of summers right there around Huntington Beach & Venice in the middle of it with all my uncles & cousins, the little girl of hippies & bikers & skaters & surfers.<br/><br/>The beginning was misleading-- as it looked like it was gonna be a Point Break macho unemotional action fantasy when the gang/locals/Vals crap was going on. I though they were going to get all that wrong & make it a stereotype, but later on, they got it very right & brought out those elements pretty much as they really were. All the actors really did a thorough job-- the young kids are gonna be great, & I didn't even recognize Heath Ledger he was so good at ""becoming"" his role. The cameos with the real characters was hilarious & very very cool. I was truly happy with the way the film went--it turned out to be very realistic, entertaining, sexy, & dramatic, & they obviously took hell of *beep* from real life events around Huntington Beach, Santa Monica, 12th & PCH & the Pacific Ocean Park pier up to the 80s through punk. There was plenty of violence & apathy around there then when all this started was developing, class warfare, asswhole rich ""coke head freaks"" from the affluent valley & poor lost hungry boys like that living in squats on the coast & fighting for fun, to feel alive, tearing up the town, raging against not having a place or purpose or future. It's not just a typical ""skaters' movie""-- it's a great movie regardless for exploring all that in a thoughtful non-stereotypical, non-judgmental way, & for getting at the fact that these young men had so much heart & love for each other despite the hard knocks & the demands of trying to deal with the problems that came along with the come up."
"atomeyes","7","2","15","8 June 2005"," A cool, fun movie without foul language
","I think some people take movies so seriously and expect to see an Academy Award contender each time they plunk down their 8 to 12 bucks. A movie can be entertaining, fun and a great time and not be considered high art. No, Lords of Dogtown won't be up for movie of the year, but that doesn't mean it won't deliver the goods. The movie is a step into 70s Venice/Santa Monica/Los Angeles during a time that was mostly filled with disco and bad clothes and drugs and thankfully, the movie is not. When you watch the movie, you're really there. It doesn't feel forced or fake and you're back in time without even noticing it until afterwords.<br/><br/>Some people have commented that the skate scenes aren't good. Well, this isn't Fuel TV, it's movie and the skate scenes to me aren't meant to be the centerpiece of the film, the characters are. The skate scenes are shot honestly and let's face it, really wild and insane skate moves weren't invented yet back then. I don't know what some people are expecting to see. <br/><br/>Heath Ledger is memorable as Skip Engblom and I gotta say Rebecca DeMornay still has a hot body. Her worn out face in the movie is courtesy of the makeup department. She's great! The stars of the film who are relative unknowns (good idea) do a fine job bringing the people they portray to life all those years ago and they even skate pretty damn good. Sure, they had stunt doubles, but thanks to the Tony Alva training camp those guys learned to skate pretty well and it shows. <br/><br/>If you want a little escape during the summer and enjoy watching movies about real people and events that really happened then you'll enjoy the movie. If you haven't been to L.A. and always wanted to visit, it's a nice little vacation and you'll learn a little bit of history behind the sport.<br/><br/>In the end, if you're open minded and like to have a good time and are not expecting the moon, you'll appreciate the movie for what it is, a little slice of the sun and fun in the 70s with a few guys who changed the world of skating forever without even meaning to do so."
"bv2k3","10","2","15","27 May 2005"," progression from documentary to feature film is excellent
","My college showed a prescreening tonight and I was thoroughly entertained. Written by one of the Z-Boys, it was like watching the documentary over again with real actors and better character development. The movie provided all the information about Dog Town and the graffiti culture that evolved there, but focused on the characters of Tony, Jay, and Stacey. Both the acting was superb and the skateboarding created that 70's surfer feel. On a spoiler note, I enjoyed how the movie ended with the three friends back skating together in the Dogbowl after there careers took them in various directions. However, while I understand it was a PG-13 movie, I think the movie lagged by craftily dodging around Jay's drug problems, that eventually landed him in jail. Anyways, it was still a terrific movie."
"marlonman5000","9","1","5","22 November 2006"," Great Film
","I honestly haven't a clue why people write a full page on why they thought the movie was bad. I own the unrated cut, and it really is a brilliant film.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to be biased, since I am very interested in the skateboarding culture, and its origins. When I look back everything was great; the acting, the spot-on story, and well the skateboarding. Some people said the acting was bad when it really wasn't. Heath Ledger playing Skip gave a breath-taking performance, and Skip himself even thought it was great portrayal of himself.<br/><br/>The Story follows the Z boys and their up and downs, and just their successes and failures.Emile gave a brilliant performance as Jay Adams; I was especially impressed with him. Same goes for Victor and John with their hanging out with the real people themselves to get to know them better. Another thing that makes the movie great is the legit skateboarding. The actors really busted their asses on learning how to skateboard on the boards from the 1970's. They barely needed a stunt double; they only used one when the director felt like it was too dangerous for them.<br/><br/>And of course, the director of the film was also brilliant. Catherine Hardwicke was a hell of a director. She really got into the whole thing. For example, when the guys were surfing, she would get in a wet suit, and directed from the water instead of a peer of some sort. Now that is dedication. Also, I loved the mind bobbling shots. It made you feel like you were skateboarding right besides those guys. They really went all out to get some skilled camera men who actually skateboarded to get the shots. Great photography.<br/><br/>Last, but not least just the story. The story is down-right amazing, and intriguing. At the end of the movie, it made you want to know more about them, and what happened to them after the end. I love movies like that. Hands down the story, the music, the direction, the acting, and just everything was very well done. If you want to go see a good movie that has great skateboarding action and is downright entertaining in every way; pick up Lords of Dogtown."

I guess it helps to be a skater at least at some point in your life, ICG wrote a great story on the making of the film, which I found very very interesting. I love Powell- Peratla Skateboards, grew up riding them.

The Z-boys relied on style to get good scores in their early competitions. There was some good action too, such as the fist fights. The movie also explained how the Z-boys went their ways.

There are definitely differences in the two, but Lords of Dogtown was not meant to be a copy of Dogtown and Z-Boys. I have heard people say that the story isn't exactly what happened. But does that really matter? Can't we appreciate that Peralta added in some twists and turns for his character, or love troubles? This movie is incredibly good.<br/><br/>But, it doesn't hurt to do some research on the Z-Boys or see Dogtown and Z-Boys as well as Lords of Dogtown.

"ctdoherty","7","1","7","14 May 2006"," Did you watch the movie?
","This movie is not Oscar material but after reading most of the reviews on here I wonder how many people actually watched it or knew anything about it. It seems that many have a grudge against the director right off the bat and that colored their commentary. Others are posting reviews that look like they're trying to imitate too many neighborhood free newspapers with a lot of Hollywood terminology but no substance. The oddest thing I found though was that most of the reviews refer to the 60s and the 80s?????? The movie makes it pretty damn clear that this takes place in the mid 70s (unless you're drunk and passed out in front of the screen). Maybe the only thing they saw of the movie was a screen capture of Skip's old Cadillac.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original documentary version of this yet and perhaps that's a good thing because I don't fall into the trap of ""it's not as good as the book"" or ""it's not as good as the original"" routine. I grew up in Germany reading Skateboarder magazines and seeing skateboarding turn from a fad (albeit a somewhat lame one) to an exciting sport when the technology and skills changed a lot around '75-'76. This movie doesn't attempt to explain that whole dynamic nor does it attempt to include everyone involved. A previous review brought up a good point that legalities and permissions probably had more to do with leaving some people out than anything else. It tells a fictionalized story based upon a few characters in Venice Beach and their transition from surfers to internationally famous skateboarders and nothing more.<br/><br/>I found it interesting because what we read about at the time in magazines seemed to be about Tony and Stacy (and certainly others) doing all kinds of revolutionary things in the skateboarding world. It wasn't until I watched this movie that I realized that a lot of what we were seeing in magazines was a microcosm of what was going on and what we had assumed everyone was doing in California (and possibly across the USA) was actually only a few kids that were getting some incredible press at the time. It's not a documentary about skateboarding. It's Hollywood and it has a touch of the differences in the characters and their relationships in it. All the main characters in the movie were actively involved in it (and had cameo parts) so I don't think there were any gross exaggerations or distortions of what the overall dynamic was, so aside from sour grapes about a director you don't like or the missing story of a couple of characters of that scene at the time, I think it still makes for an entertaining flick. There most certainly is a storyline where the characters start out together, move in divergent ways and, to a certain extent, come together in the end so I'm not sure where some comments regarding a complete lack of story come in.<br/><br/>As far as the acting is concerned, I'm also pretty curious about the reviews. Michael Angarano is noted as the newcomer in the crowd when he is probably the only one other than Heath Ledger that has had any real exposure before. While some reviewers laud Heath Ledger for his role, they also comment on how it is close to Val Kilmer's take on Jim Morrison or to Johnny Depp. Is that supposed to be a good thing that he reprises another actors role of another character? I saw it as pure Val Kilmer as either Jim Morrison or Doc Holliday and it took me a little while to be sure that it wasn't Val Kilmer while I was watching it. I wouldn't call that the best acting of the movie. I think the ""toothy"" acting of Heath Ledger was pretty scary at best. As for the skater characters, I think they all played their scripted roles pretty well. Stacy Peralta's character was pretty virginal but then again I don't think that he would write it in any more straight-laced than he was. Tony Alva was at least as big-headed as I remember reading about at the time. I was most intrigued by Jay Adams's (that should be ADAMS not ALLEN for the reviewer that was so familiar with the scene but forgot his name) character as he didn't get nearly as much exposure at the time and I think his story is more interesting than the rest, and at the end of the movie he is credited with being the ""seed"" of the movement and is also shown showing up the two ""superstars"" in the final pool sequence.<br/><br/>As someone who watches movies without having any preconceived notions about who is directing it, producing it, writing it, acting in it, etc., I really enjoyed it and after watching it once on Starz and then checking on IMDb.com to see who the actors were and also that most of the main characters had small parts in the movie, I watched it again when I saw it start again on another Starz sub-channel a half hour later."
"ray-280","10","1","8","14 August 2006"," Death of a Documentary and a pre-porn Nikki Reed
","That sums up the two things I took from this movie: 1. It ruined one of the best documentaries of all time (Dogtown and Z-Boys); and 2. Nikki Reed, now 18, could become the biggest porn star of all time if she chooses to go that route.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, #1 can't be undone, and #2 probably never will be done. That leaves very few positives from a movie that would have been tolerable without the documentary, but anyone who saw the precursor to this film would have a difficult time appreciating the good points of the story, and there were actually a few.<br/><br/>The real story of this film is how a group of brash, young skaters from Dogtown turned the world upside down by adapting surf moves to the pavement, giving birth to what would become extreme sports and the x-games. This is definitely a story worth telling, as it's not the only time a ""pod"" has yielded several individuals (in this case, Peralta, Alva and company) who take over an industry. It's happened before (such as with the British invasion in music in the 1960s), and it's happened since (such as with rap from the Bronx in the 1970s, or grunge rock from Seattle in the early 1990s). Whenever a ""pod"" explodes, it's noteworthy and historically relevant. The Z-boys were one such pod.<br/><br/>That said, the movie absolutely, positively, sucked. Which one was Heath Ledger? Oh yeah, Skip, the shop guru. None of the actors really stand out, the skating scenes sucked (I did better tricks on my ""Hang Ten"" skateboard as a kid than what I saw in the film), and Nikki Reed looking like she struck oil whenever she meets one of these badboys is about the only genuine performance, given the grown-up wild-child's penchant for sexual adventure. She definitely scorches the camera in this one, and according to IMDb.com, the ""thirteen"" star is now a barely-legal eighteen, though she was seventeen when this came out and probably sixteen when it was made.<br/><br/>If there's one story the film did tell, it's what it feels like to be normal among your friends and a total revolutionary to anyone watching you. Having experienced this somewhat myself (I was in a ""pod"" that changed a different world not long ago), I can relate to the main characters in the film, guys who just did what they loved doing, who never really cared about doing anything other than what they loved to do, but who in the process became a social phenomenon of historical importance. It's not like these kids thought they were doing anything other than skating in some empty pools, feeding off the wealthy like the parasites they were, on the fringes of the law, but living a life far more interesting than money could ever buy.<br/><br/>Memo to Nikki Reed: do porn. It's your calling."

","Lords of Dogtown [ Movie review ] Rating: 7.5/10 I have to admit, this movie surprised me. I expected a bunch of four letter words being spewed out by young rebels backed by a soundtrack of grunge/punk rock music. Wrong.<br/><br/>While this is not a script movie, the movie does succeed in developing interesting characters. The cinematography keeps you glued, and the soundtrack is wisely chosen and classic rock (Joe Walsh, Pink Floyd) all the way.<br/><br/>The Lords of Dogtown is about seven friends from Venice Beach, CA (the ""ghetto by the sea"") who all share the same love for skateboarding and surfing. It is a true story of the beginnings of the sport that started in the '70s and has now evolved into the ever popular ""X Games"".<br/><br/>Led by the brainstorming of their older, revered friend (and ultimate manager Skip), these reckless teens form a skateboarding team called the ""Zephyrs"". After training for two weeks, they enter contests across the country and begin building their legend. Their brash style steps on toes, but is a necessary ingredient in the evolution of their dangerous art form. While the lure of money and fame threatens a divisiveness amongst the team, the boys' friendship and camaraderie win out at the end.<br/><br/>Especially satisfying is to discover that the platforms used today for skateboarding competitions were born out of empty in-ground pools, left dry by a summer drought. The boys hop fences to skate in as many of these empty pools as they can find, improvising new moves on their newfound surface.<br/><br/>While the ""Lords of Dogtown"" is not for everyone (considering its' rebellious nature, profanity and drug use), I found the movie to be entertaining, engrossing and at times visually stunning.<br/><br/>Similar in style to: Point Break"
"darrin","4","1","10","25 May 2008"," ""Jack-Ass"" with a classic rock soundtrack! LOL!
","While fast-paced, this film was nothing more than ""Jack-Ass"" with a Classic Rock soundtrack! LOL! Therein lies the problem with making a film about skateboarding (like golf - I never understood the fascination with it) - 90% of the film has an endless stream of skateboard stunts. While the filmmaker tried to shed some light on their personal lives, the characters still came across as one-dimensional hooligans. The documentary, ""Dogtown & Z-boys"" was far more interesting. The filmmaker should have built an inner story, as was done in the film, ""Gleaming The Cube."" All in all: great music, great skateboard stunts, mediocre film."

","Lords of Dogtown is one of the best movies to come out of 2005. It has it's funny parts then its more dramatic meaningful parts, the two contrasts of the both make the film really enjoyable. If you love the whole surf/skateboard scene you will absolutely love it! Even if you aren't that keen on the surf/skateboard scene its still a movie to check out. Heath Ledger was wonderful, he portrayed his character Skip really well. And Emile Hirsch is in it, which is always a bonus! The on bad thing about the movie is the girls fashion! It is set in the 1970's so the fashions is old and very floral. Lords of Dogtown mostly appeals to teenagers, but anyone could enjoy it, except really religious people because there is a lot of underage drinking and drug use. But I loved the movie! So go see it!"
"mike-925","Null","1","12","9 June 2005"," Capturing Skateboarding and the Seventies with Heath Ledger and His Merry Men
","Lords is a high energy film that drags the audience speeding along with it, tracing the early history of skateboarding in Venice, California.<br/><br/>We follow the fortunes of four roughly 15 to 17 year old boys and some of their girlfriends along with an alcoholic skateboard entrepreneur named Skip.<br/><br/>The Lords start their day by boarding off the roofs of the run-down rentals of their parents, in Venice. They hook a ride on a city transit bus until the driver spots them in the rear view and starts fish-tailing to shake them off.<br/><br/>Which turns out to be no problem. Our heroes drop off the bus jag, and segue into a line of stalled traffic, weaving in and out of the car line-up at high speed, by turns, dazzling and angering assorted drivers. Later, the most daring of the Four performs the crazy trick of boarding right thru a red light at a dangerous intersection without being hit.<br/><br/>Skip badgers and cajoles the kids constantly. He exploits them to promote the skateboards he is manufacturing at his Zephyr surfing gear and skateboard store. We are at the dawn of the Skateboard craze and Skip is bent on becoming a millionaire early. Only, he drinks quite a bit and shows signs of being a burnt-out 35 year old hippie.<br/><br/>That is the MO of one of the kid's Moms too, played by Rebecca De Mornay, who is so gone she uses expressions like ""far out"" and ""man"" and ""can you dig it?"" Even her kids treat her like a whacked out hippie. There is a heavy subtext of abused kids with parents who've failed to grow up.<br/><br/>At one point, De Mornay's current ""old man"" is moving out, and asks her reluctant son to help him, cautioning him to put a blanket over an enormous clear garbage bag of marijuana before carrying it to his car, and offering his surf board as a guilty pay-off for abandoning him, a scene both appalling and amusing to the audience.<br/><br/>Skip keeps running his hand-to-mouth manufacturing enterprise, employing other whacked hippies like himself, only working when they need enough jack to make a connection. Its hard to keep a production schedule when your 'groovy' friends refuse to show up for work. I've just realized, looking at the cast on IMDb, that the cool but whacked Skip is Australian Heartthrob Heath Ledger. This part is so good and Ledger so good in it, he deserves an Oscar. I didn't recognize him in his granny seventies blonde long hair. Its his best work on screen.<br/><br/>The Lords are perplexed and demoralized by the growing showbiz that is starting to overtake boarding. They gradually have given up on Skip, and begun to quarrel. But before falling completely apart, they define a new stunt that quickly makes them the crowned heads of sidewalk surfing.<br/><br/>Los Angeles Area pool-owners are ordered to drain their pools. The Lords decide to practice new stunts in empty pools, stealing into backyards the instant the owners go to work. The audience watches as the surfers perform outrageous tricks in the pools. An article appears in Skateboarding, another in People. Suddenly our boys are stars!<br/><br/>Only not all of them like it. An evil presence has intruded into their idyllic childhoods. One of the Lords steals a girl from a more waspish Lord, who looks like he is one of the Hansens singing group. There's a lot of long blond summer surfing hair on these guys. Only one of them has dark hair. One Lord refuses to accept any of the offers. He turns skinhead and starts hanging out with a gang. The Waspish one gets an endorsement deal and starts touring for a board company. Another of the Lords wants all the marbles, and signs with a Hollywood type who travels with an entourage of hangers-on and cheap bimbos in a longish limousine.<br/><br/>The hapless Skip has lost his guys and his business. We see him hand crafting a surfboard in the back of someone Else's surfing store. A clerk from the retail side comes in and asks if he'll have a customer's board ready by the next day. Skip says yeah, sure. When they leave, Skip relaxes, lights a cig, reaches for his hidden bottle, turns on the radio, acts out a lip-synched Maggie Mae that would put Rod Stewart out of business, then quietly returns to work. The whole 45 second turn is the best thing in the movie.<br/><br/>The wonderful ease of the Lords and the culture they created is spoiled by Success. The Lords stop seeing one another until the dark-haired kid develops a brain tumor and the others, finding success is not what its cracked up to be, gather at his father's dry pool for a rendezvous. An American Graffitti-style Epilogue tells us who the Lords become when they finally grow up.<br/><br/>When the lights go up I'm surprised to find two pairs of girls the only audience viewing the film with me. Voila!, why didn't I see it? This is a chick flick, even a skin movie for girls, since there is quite a bit of bared male surface in it. In the lobby, I notice two of the girls are dressed totally in black, wearing the wool knit hats cool black guys now affect year around, and sporting chains that run from the belt loops of black pants to enormous truckers wallets in their back pockets. <br/><br/>Lords reminds me a little of the stylish Fast and the Furious of a few years ago, but its ten times better. I'm still trying to figure out those two girls."
"RoonyRockerandGOoc","8","1","12","8 June 2005"," Overall good movie
","This movie is more than a movie about rebellious teenagers growing up in the 70s, its a story of how uniqueness, individuality, and not caring what people think turned into something that influenced people for years to follow.<br/><br/>But I think they could have done a better job. I could have been made very true to the story instead of changing things so that the film would make more money.<br/><br/>For people who don't know the story of the Z-boyz, then you will enjoy this movie because it is a great movie. For people who know the story of the Z-boyz then this will still be a good movie but the documentary will be better to see the real guys in action.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good movie that is entertaining and factual but it still could have been made better."

","I was SO impressed by this movie. Some friends of mine went to the previews and raved about it. So when I saw it, i was amazed. It's about a group of guys from California who skateboard just for fun, but when they join a group, 2 become famous and 2 are left as regular guys who still have their normal problems, while they're ex-friends are out skateboarding for thousands of people. They're jealous of them for their success, but know they forgot the people who believed in them first. I loved the plot, the ending, and probably most the hot guys in it. Overall, i rate it a 10 and I definitely recommend you see it if you like surfing and/or skateboarding."
"swinters47","7","1","12","3 June 2005"," up and down
","This movie--and the documentary that preceded it--taught me a lot about the history of skateboarding but made me think about much more than that. On the surface, it tells the story of a group of young boys who created a unique skateboarding style in Venice Beach in the mid 1970s that went on to influence the whole world. But at its heart, this movie is a story about the American Dream, writ large across the concrete, urban face of the late twentieth century. It's about rising up from the bottom to the heights of glory and then coming back down to earth again. Much like a skateboard ride up and down the edge of an empty swimming pool.<br/><br/>While this movie is spottier on the history of the Dogtown skateboarding style than the earlier documentary, it does help the viewer out by focusing the story on the three main dogs from the ""legendary"" Zephyr skateboarding team: Tony Alva, Jay Adams and Stacey Peralta. It follows them as they serendipitously develop their own style of skateboarding in the schoolyards and backyards (and empty pools!) of their neighborhood, Dogtown, and then go on to revolutionize the world of skateboarding with it. And then it shows you how they struggle to deal with the trappings of their own success.<br/><br/>Since the story is based on actual events, the movie's ""plot"" doesn't follow the typical narrative structure of having everything lead up to a climax, or a happy ending, or what have you. So the viewer is mostly left with a portrait of the three main characters' distinct personalities, and their unique approaches to dealing with the events that are rapidly unfolding all around them. Which only seems appropriate, since skateboarding is a sport where the object of the game is to express your own personal style.<br/><br/>What's interesting about the way the story progresses is that it shows that each of the main characters' strengths is also a weakness--whether that be Alva's egotism, Adams' recklessness, or Peralta's reliability. Thankfully, the movie doesn't try to wrap up all those flaws neatly by making it seem like ""that's why they all needed each other"", or something obnoxiously happy like that. It's just the way they are. And they each have to live with the consequences, good and bad.<br/><br/>Another aspect of this movie that I like is the way that it captures the randomness and spontaneity of the small kernel of creative insight that led to a revolution. In that way it reminds you that there will always be something pure and right burning at the heart of whatever the characters decide to do with their lives. I think (or hope) that everybody has moments of clarity in their lives like that. Like the moment that you realized you were in love with the person you would eventually marry. Or the excitement you felt when you first discovered the work that would become your career. Those moments that you can always go back to when you can no longer see through the institutional build-up in your soul.<br/><br/>In that sense I feel like this is a movie with a universal message to tell. A message about how to synthesize the passion and freedom and creativity of youth with real life.<br/><br/>Good stuff."
"Robert_duder","8","1","13","6 February 2006"," The Ultimate skater/teenage angst film
","Lords of Dogtown is the skate movie of all skate movies. But beyond that it's a film about fame, friendship, talent, the seventies, and growing up. All the performances are really well done and for fans of skating you'll just love this film. It's done perfectly!! Veteran film maker Catherine Hardwicke captures the seventies brilliantly. The performances by the former hippy culture, the teens experiencing everything the seventies offered and the rebellion they felt. Also the director of the controversial film Thirteen, Hardwicke seems to have a real knack at perfectly capturing teenage feelings and rebellion and Lords of Dogtown shows her ability once again.<br/><br/>The big name attached to the film is Heath Ledger and his role is probably underplayed but brilliant nonetheless. I've always liked Ledger, he's one of my favorite young actors ever since 10 Things I Hate About You, and the Patriot. He's really shown his acting ability and is just now really getting acclaim for it with his Oscar nod for playing the gay cowboy in the powerhouse Brokeback Mountain. His performance in Lords of Dogtown is brilliant. He plays Skip, the enormously respected surfer, former hippie, alcoholic, and dreams of riches. He's rough and rugged and you kinda hate him but feel sorry for him too. It's a great performance if not a little small. The main characters in the film, the teenager skaters who make it big are played by John Robinson, Emile Hirsch, and Victor Rasuk. Now Emile Hirsch I came to know from another great little coming of age story...The Girl Next Door where he did a great job in the lead. His role in Lords of Dogtown is completely different...night and day from his previous role and he does a great job. His role as Jay is gritty and dark compared to previous roles. John Robinson as the much more innocent and emotionally strong Stacy also does a great job. He holds everyone together and is much more stable than the rest of them despite being kept out of the group for much of the time. Rasuk plays the star struck, loud, flashy T.A. (Tony Alva.) Driven by his father, and bent on being famous he's the first to go down the wrong path. All three of them can skate something wicked (if they did their own skating, it's unbelievable.) On top of that they have great roles and do a great job. You get drawn into their world as the story takes them from a small group of friends to being torn apart by their own ambitions and offers. Also noteworthy performances are from Michael Angarano who plays Sid. Sid is mostly just a tag along but he gets the benefit of playing terminally ill which for a good actor means a touching role. Also noteworthy is the very small role by Rebecca De Mornay who plays Hippy struggling single Mom Philaine. She does a great job playing something I've never seen her do before. As mentioned the role is small but well done.<br/><br/>A great story, with great skating and a really cool setting in the seventies captured brilliantly by the music and clothes and cars and the setting that started skateboarding into a phenomenon. I said to myself that if Tony Hawk didn't do a cameo it would be a disappointment and sure enough I spotted him!! I won't say where...I'll give you the fun of catching him. It's a great cameo. Definitely check this one out because it's well worth watching and a great film!! 8/10"

","*might contain some spoilers*** hey i saw this movie last week with my friend, just picked it up for kicks, since then i have watched it 4 times already. This movie is based on the true story of the Z boys, and it has it's time to shine in this movie. The acting is great, i think its a better idea to have real actors play the parts, instead of the pro skateboarders because it gives the movie a more real feeling and its more about their style than their skateboarding abilities. The thing that i liked most about this movie is that it actually happened, and this is how the Z boys lived. I think it's sad though when they break up and go different ways ( and when jay shaves his head!!!).I really thought this movie was so good because of the style of the movie. it wasn't supposed to be a big hit movie with well known actors. it was more about showing the life of 3 kids who took a chance and made history by doing something they love. and i think that is why most people didn't like the movie as much. they were thinking this was gonna be a huge hit movie. but that is why this movie is so good. it is a different style of writing and filming. i don't think they could have done it any better way. i will remember this movie for a long time. plus the soundtrack is incredible!!!**and credit to Emile Hirsch who played jay , the spark of the movie*."

","I really liked this movie a lot! Having already watched the documentary, for a long time I felt there was no point in watching the movie, but I was wrong. I waited for it to come out on DVD to watch it, and enjoyed it so much I watched it three days in a row, including ALL the special features. Which brings me to the point of why I'm commenting in the first place. I read quite a few of the other comments left on this movie, and found it interesting that there were so many negative comments & people stating that the documentary was so much better and the story was wrong, etc. These people must not have watched the DVD Special Features, or looked very much into the movie at all. Almost EVERY SINGLE member of the Z-Boys made cameos in the movie, and helped Director Catherine Hardwicke with details. Not only that, Tony Alva was one of the main people who taught the Actors in the movie how to skate! There were Z-Boys on set almost every day while filming. There is also footage of Jay Adams himself stating that he felt the documentary was not exactly a true depiction of him, and that Actor Emile Hirsch portrayed him very well in this movie. Not to mention the fact that Z-Boy Stacy Peralta was credited for writing the film. Maybe these are some things to think about. Just watch the movie, it's great!!"

","This was an excellent movie, if you're a skateboard enthusiast. I'm not sure how it is if you don't skate, because I'm the former, not the latter. Anyway this was a great film depicting the life of the Zephyr surfers/skaters. Heath Ledger did a great job with Skip Engblom, he reminded me a bit of Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean. The film was loosely based on a true story, because many of the dramatic events, were easily recognized as fictional, just to add emotion. Stacy Peralta did a good job writing this, but he seemed to make his character seem innocent, I'm not sure if that's how it really was or not. The filmmakers didn't show Jay Adams as much of a trouble maker, as described in the documentary. I was also left wondering through most of the film, when Jeff Ho was gonna show up, and it didn't seem he did. Craig Stecyck wasn't really portrayed either. I loved the cameos of the original Z-boys, like when the actual Jay Adams, says ""Hey Jay!"" to the fictional one in the movie. If you've seen the documentary you can see cameos littered throughout the movie. I thought the ending was a bit sudden, it seemed that way in the documentary too. Both the movie and documentary had their emotional parts prior to the ending, and both ended in the Dogbowl. Overall I thought this was a great5 movie."

","""Lords of Dogtown"" narrates the story of three California skateboard phenoms, who took skateboarding from a past time for surfers to a legitimate sport of its own during the late 70's. Based off the 2001 documentary ""Dogtown and Z Boys"" directed by one of the legendary Z Boys, Stacy Peralta, the film provides an intimate look at how the three friends went from teammates to bitter rivals, once corporate sponsorship took over the budding sport.<br/><br/>The film starts in 1976 Venice Beach, CA an area known as Dogtown to the locals, where three high school friends Tony Alva (Victor Raskuk), Stacy Peralta (John Robinson), and Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) are trying to break into an elite group of surfers lead by Zephyr surf shop owner Skip (Heath Ledger). Surfing quickly becomes an afterthought, however, when the boys acquire newly designed skateboard wheels, that allow them to same maneuverability on their skateboards as they have while surfing. Soon they're skating around town full time and sneaking into backyards to skate in drained pools, at the time Los Angeles was going through a water shortage crisis.<br/><br/>The only thing growing faster than their talent was the sport of skateboarding itself, and Skip puts together a Zephyr skateboarding team featuring the young trio. The three go on to dominate various skateboarding competitions and quickly became icons of the growing skateboard counterculture. Their success brings both money and trouble. Dissension between the older more surf-oriented members of the Zephyr label and young skaters brews, and corporate sponsors quickly lure Alva, Peralta, and Adams away. The Zephyr team breaks up and the three friends go from spending every day together to barely speaking.<br/><br/>Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, ""Lords of Dogtown"" compels its audience by putting them right in the middle of Dogtown skateboard culture. Using a lot of hand held camera, Hardwicke captures the fun and spontaneity of what it must have been like to be eighteen and spend every day skating, partying, and running from the cops. As a viewer, you understand why these slum kids are drawn to the skating lifestyle, so when innocence gives way to greed, the loss registers.<br/><br/>Hardwicke also avoids the normal Hollywood over-dramatization. She lets the story unfold naturally and never exploits side plot lines, like the dependence of Jay's mother on the money he makes, to create un-needed melodrama. ""Lords"" is a great story about how young talent and passion can fuel dreams, before more adult desires take over.<br/><br/>Three and a half out of four stars"

The sets were also recreated very nicely, giving the movie a good vibe. If you want the real story of the zboys get the documentary, the movie is very dramatic and overexagerates the characters. The movie had it's flaws, the characters aren't completely rounded and at times the transitions feel a little choppy. Despite it's downfalls, I still found the movie to be entertaining and able to evoke some emotion from the viewer.

","Lords of Dogtown is about 3 young skateboarders who grew up into professional skaters who have taken the sport to a whole new level. It is a movie that touches a lot on the history of Jay, Stacy, and Tony and also the experience and the thick and thin that those 3 youngsters faced during their walk to fame. A beautiful thing about the movie is that it shows how friendship transcends fame and fortune. The movie also stressed on their achievement and contribution to the sport, for instance, the maneuvers created by the boys (especially Jay Adams) and how they turned swimming pools into skateboarding rings. Besides that, the movie also showed how Skip, the owner of Zephyr skateboards signed the skaters and how Jay, Stacy and Tony first got notice by other companies and also how he failed in his business subsequently which he ended up producing surf boards for his rival. The movie had a rather sad and touching ending where the boys' childhood friend eventually died of brain cancer.<br/><br/>The music immaculately fits the movie and the actors gave a stellar performance despite the fact that they are still new to the scene. Heath Ledger did give a good performance but too bad he did not appear in most of the scenes. It was hard to identify him at first due to his shades and his character in the movie (Lol!). The information given about the what happened to the boys later after the ending was useful and very informative (to help prevent curiosity to viewers who don't know much about these skaters). This movie succeeds in thoroughly explaining every vivid events in the lives of these 3 skaters. I would give this movie a rating of 8 out of 10"

","I just watched this movie yesterday and I think its so good. I'm going to buy the DVD as soon as I can. I love skateboarding and thats mostly the reason why I love this movie so much. So many people think this movie sucks and thats cause they are not a big skateboarding fan, so if your really into skateboarding you have to watch this movie. There was nothing I didn't like about this movie, the storyline was good, the actors were great(and hot). Even if your not a skateboarding fan you can still watch this movie, I watched this with other people who are not a skateboarding fan and they still liked this movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10."

","I have just watched the special edition version of this film,and i must say being very impressed with the outcome. The only problem is the film really sells out the true skateboarding idea thats its for the surf man,not the money. I found the actors to be at time uncanny in looks true to the original Skateboarders. I really fail to see why go for a PG13 rating after all anyone who was around in the 1970's would be well past 13 by now,and the Skateboard tricks then are unlikely to impress today,so new skat-boarders of today,its not for you. It is clear Stacy has went to try and capture real footage from his last outing onto Hollywood Film,and this is done to great effect. I found myself after watching it once getting radical again.<br/><br/>It don't really matter that it wont win the Oscars,its good fun with some great vintage action,and some great one liners (Grey Beavers!!)<br/><br/>To recap,a real Skateboard film,with some great cameo moments,from the original skateboarders,and a quote to all from a BBC documentary at the time (1979) 'Skaterboarders don't die,they just roll a little slower'<br/><br/>Donald Suttie Dundee Scotland"

","This is a bad ass movie and any one who says other wise either hasn't seen it or likes to rent scifi channel movies and have no taste. The movie is a adrenaline rush, and the skate scenes are raw. The movie sticks to the truth with hardly any exaggeration about what happened. So don't bash something you know nothing about. Emile Hirsch did a great job of portraying Jay Adams with his attitude and intensity in skating and in life. I think that Catherine Hardwicke did a great job and has stepped up since thirteen. The fight scenes the sex scenes and definitely the skate scenes in this movie kicked ass and should be praised as one the great summer movies."

","Being a long time fan of the Dogtown culture I awaited this delicious piece of candy. Dogtown and Z-Boys is one story I never get tired of watching, reading, or looking at Stecyk's pictures. Also integral in this story is the music of the times; carefully chosen are the songs preferred by one and all. Impressive was the skating mastered by the actors, and equally impressive to me was the ability of Ms. Hardwicke to capture a cultural moment and the flavor of this beach town. There is one scene of ""Skip"" and ""Jay Adams"" mourning the end of an era that was so powerful you could literally feel them mourning the loss of that time. Don't let the fact you might be the oldest one in the theater deter you, this is not to be missed on the big screen."

","I'm giving this movie the highest rating in order to balance out the poor ones given here. Lords of Dogtown is fantastic. Easily the best movie I've seen all summer (year?). Heath Ledger gives an outstanding, award worthy performance. Example: I recognized him briefly in the beginning of the movie and then completely lost track of him until the movie was almost over. I kept thinking to myself, ""When does his character come back into the movie?"", not realizing I had been watching him the whole time. Totally unrecognizable.<br/><br/>Forget about the summer ""blockbusters"", which are nothing more than re-hashed car chases, explosions, and fancy special effects. Yawn. This film is about story, characters, and the thrill of doing something that no one else has done before. Go watch Lords of Dogtown!

","I enjoyed the movie ""Lords of Dogtown"" very much. I am very interested in learning about some of the skateboarding history. I thought the acting was pretty good and had a realistic approach to the events of the 1970's when it seems that skateboarding became popular. I would definitely encourage teenagers who are into skateboarding to see this film. I would however caution preteen viewers. The film does contain some alcohol and drug use by teenagers. It does not glorify the use, but it does depict things that teens may try that would not be in their best interests. Since this is based upon factual events, the film told how the main characters made out in life after their experiences as part of the Z-team. I think that was a fitting end to the film."

","I initially went to see this movie went to see this movie with my boyfriend because he all in all begged me to see it with him and a group of his friends.I went in expecting the same exact thing the documentary had which wasn't that interesting to me. But when the film began to unfold I couldn't stop watching! The fact that it really was a skating/surfing movie was one of the reasons we went to see it but in the end for me I was just amazed at how Tony,Jay,and Stacy's lives had all taken different turns. Not just that but I LOVED SID!! His role kind of made the movie for me in someways . I actually cried at the end when Tony,Jay,and Stacy all got back together to skate and see the dying Sid. Then when the little 'factoids' flashed across the screen saying that Sid had died I started to cry like a little child. Saying all that to say this Lords of Dogtown is more than a movie about Surfers and Skaters it is a great movie about getting out of the places you don't want to be and attaining your goals. Not to mention if you love skating or surfing some of the tricks in this movie are SiCk."
"jedigollum","10","1","14","14 June 2005"," The Lords of Dogtown: The Return of the Z-Boys
","I never had known of the Z-Boys, and this movie was a perfect explanation to see... Now all I need is DogTown and the Z-Boys and I'll be a happy girl.<br/><br/>It had everything someone like me could want - music and skating, plus of course all the basic, obvious things that was going to show up... sex, violence... But it did not just have that, you could see the emotional side to the characters.<br/><br/>Stacy Peralta (John Robinson) was probably the most well-behaved of the bunch, and even if many will argue that the real Stacy wrote himself like this purposely, it gives the story a commonly gentle character. I especially loved the way Stacy would act when he learned he was not a part of the team, so some great acting was done by John Robinson, but not only him. Emile did a great Jay Adams and Tony Alva turned out stunningly like the real Alva, with great emotion and such.<br/><br/>Sid, even if it is said that he never really existed, was such a sweet soft character who just wanted to be like them, and bringing the three main Z-Boys together in the end had to be one of my favorite parts - even if some would say it never happened. I was upset that Sid died, even if he was just a character, so more and more emotion appears.<br/><br/>The movie is, overall, a great movie. I know I will buy it on DVD to go with my other favorites. This movie has everything I think it needs: skating, music, some violence/swearing but also plenty emotion and action. The only thing you'd have to be able to stand is all the teens that go to visit it - I know I wasn't the only teenager there when I went."
"larry-411","10","1","15","30 September 2005"," A very pleasant surprise
","Lords Of Dogtown was a surprise. Not a huge one, since I had seen clips and knew a bit about the film and the ""plot."" It's based on a true story, so there are no big mysteries here. So like any film based on a true story, the key is in the storytelling. I always want to be pleasantly surprised. So when I already know what is going to happen, my attitude is ""go ahead, make my day."" <br/><br/>In no particular order, these were my pleasant surprises:<br/><br/>1) The soundtrack. Or should I say the music. If you are familiar with the music of the 70s, you'll hear one classic after another. It is virtually nonstop -- more like an extended music video than a film with music. There are very few moments in the film when there isn't music playing. And I don't mean a score -- there isn't a traditional one -- there are mostly songs, one great song after another. <br/><br/>Of course, if you have ever been to or seen any kind of extreme sports in person or on TV there is always rock blaring underneath. So the sound of the film is the sound of skateboarding itself. I can't imagine them having done it any other way. <br/><br/>And the moments without music are so dramatic in the absence of it. It is essentially opposite of how films are usually made. Instead of music punctuating poignant moments, here we have silence punctuating most of the poignant moments. It is very powerful. <br/><br/>2) The look. It is shot more like a documentary, with mostly handhelds and natural lighting. The outdoor scenes all have the look of a home video to some extent. You really get the feeling you are following them around with cameras. And most of the interiors are very softly lit in hues of blue and amber, so even then it doesn't feel like a typical movie. In most films, lighting more than anything dictates the ""movie"" look. Just like with the music, this takes the opposite approach. <br/><br/>If you appreciate the look of a film and cinematography, you'll really enjoy how this was done.<br/><br/>3) The performances. There are 3 main skaters. The one who is considered the ""father"" of modern skateboarding is Jay Adams, played by Emile Hirsch. This is so different a role than any he has ever played. He is scary in this. He is wild, crazy, mad, and the rebel of the bunch. I know that he wanted to stay in character throughout the filming and it's easy to see why. It is an incredible transformation and a shocking performance. He is stunning in this, physically as well as in his performance. <br/><br/>The next is Stacy Peralta, played by John Robinson. Stacy is the one who wrote the documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys,"" on which this was based. He wrote and directed the documentary. It was so successful that many wanted to see the ""story"" told. So he wrote this film. Since he wrote it, it is told from his perspective to some extent and so his character is the most sympathetic. <br/><br/>But that is perfect for Robinson, since the character is very similar to his character in Elephant. He is sweet, good-natured, kind, friendly, affectionate, and pretty. So if you liked his character in Elephant, you will love him here. <br/><br/>The 3rd is Tony Alva, played by Victor Rasuk. Like Jay, he is not necessarily a very likable character but it's not hard to imagine what it must be like to go from zero to hero.<br/><br/>But the most amazing performance, and the one that steals the movie, is from Heath Ledger as Skip, who runs the surf/skate shop where they meet and first organize as a team. He is essentially the one who guided their careers in the early days, and although I am not a big fan of Ledger and wasn't expecting much, I would even say it is an Oscar-worthy performance. Just blew me away. Breathtaking. <br/><br/>Again, it's hard to comment on the ""story"" or the ""sets"" since they are telling a true story. And they don't spoonfeed you the story -- it is told in bits and pieces and you sort of have to put them together yourself. They chose not to have a narrator, so there is no ""and this is the day we discovered swimming pools."" You just have to figure out the significance of the moments on your own. <br/><br/>So if you know nothing about the history of these guys or of modern skateboarding, you may be confused. They don't telegraph much. You find yourself looking back on scenes and saying ""oh, that's what that meant"" as opposed to going into a scene saying ""I know what's supposed to happen here."" The filmmakers assume going in that you know the story beforehand. So it might be good to read a bit about it if you aren't familiar with it. <br/><br/>This was a very difficult film to make since almost all the action involving the 3 stars is dangerous. They could not use doubles or stuntmen for everything or else they would have had very little to do. So they had to learn to skate. And there are a lot of stunts that they did themselves which would be amazing even if they were stuntmen, and in many cases they are not. These guys could have gotten themselves killed on this film. <br/><br/>Watch for Elden Henson (of Butterfly Effect), Rebecca DeMornay as Jay's (Emile's) mother, and Michael Angarano as Sid, another of the Z-Boys. He is adorable and a joy to watch. Watch for him -- he has a big career ahead of him."
"amkg87@yahoo.com","10","1","15","30 September 2005"," Lords of Dogtown Rocks!!!
","I feel that the directing of the film was excellent. It captured the feeling and the emotion behind the real story of the z-boys. As I discuss this movie with others, I often say how much I love it. But that is not enough to really say what I loved about it. When I think back on the film, there is not one scene that I would take out. And this is rare for me to feel this way about a film. I saw the movie twice in the same day, and not because I don't have a life, but because it was that good. I especially loved the soundtrack that accompanied the movie, I feel that music is extremely important when dealing with films because they can either make or break the movie. And I feel that it was done very well and I know this because now every time I hear one of the songs from the soundtrack on the radio, I think of the scene in which it played in the movie. So without it being distracting it added and almost made a lasting impression. As you can see, I could go on and on, but I will leave it at that and let the rest of ya'll watch the movie for yourselves to see whether or not you can agree."

","Catherine Hardwicke is 2 for 2 thus far in her directorial career, first with Thirteen and now with Lords Of Dogtown, a look at the pioneers of competitive skateboarding. John Robinson, Emile Hirsch, and Victor Rasuk are all strong in their lead roles (although Hirsch is a little too pretty to be a convincing tough guy), and Heath Ledger does a good job portraying burned up leader Skip--a guy who futilely tries to run an emerging cash cow with a stoner's philosophy. All of the actors are impressive skateboarders, and that adds to the raw realism the film conveys. Hardwicke does a good job showing how the sudden fame and fortune ultimately dissolves the friendships."
"n1witch","9","1","16","26 March 2006"," Lords of Dogtown gets my vote!!!!
","I really liked this movie and I don't know why your bashing it so much.<br/><br/>The plot is of the three main z-boys Stacey, Tony and Jay and some of the parts of there lives that happened, of course with a few Hollywood fiction points added.<br/><br/>The real people from this movie that are still alive and where involved say this is a terrific film and is like stepping back in time.<br/><br/>While some people believe the camera was shaky and disorientating if you look closer you will notice a lot of special filming technique's such as a lip stick camera and some shots are made to make you feel you are actually skating. Each character was also given a style of filming to their attitudes. Stacey is mostly shot straight on. Tony from an angle upwards and Jay from all over the place.<br/><br/>While I don't really skate and didn't think I would like a skating movie I loved it. It has a deep character based plot and startling settings and shots (think where Jay skates of the pier). The acting could have been a touch tighter but considering they were playing poor teens in the seventies there would have been slang and uneducated speech.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the reasons I Love this film so much is that I am a eighteen yr old who relates to the film, even though I wasn't around in the seventies."
"italianprncs0210","10","1","16","25 February 2006"," amazing movie
","To understand this movie, you have to have some experience skating or surfing, or at least have some appreciation for it. You also can't go into it thinking you're gonna hate it. I personally think it's an amazing movie, if you disregard some of the (according to the first comment) ""amateaur"" acting. It has a sort of young person feel and you have to be young or remember what it's like to be young to appreciate it. Someone also commented on the camera use, the camera use just makes it better. It gives it a more frenzied feel and gets you more into the movie, it makes you feel like you could be one of the characters. Take Baz Luhrman for example, who directed Moulin Rouge and the 1996 version of Romeo and Juliet. The camera literally goes all over the place, especially in Moulin Rouge, but it adds to the effect of the movie, it doesn't take away from it. Sure you can go watch the documentary if you want, and it will probably be more accurate and tell a closer story to what really happened, but this actually gives you a feel of what it would be like to live in Venice, California in 1970 and through the rest of their lives."

"Wuchakk","6","0","1","13 May 2019"," The birth of skateboard culture
","In the mid-70s, the accomplishments of the innovative Zephyr skateboarding team of Venice, California, are dramatized based on events chronicled in skater Stacy Peralta's documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" (2001). John Robinson plays Stacy, Emile Hirsch plays Jay and Victor Rasuk plays Tony (aka T.A.). Heath Ledger is on hand as Skip Zephyr while Rebecca De Mornay appears as a struggling mother.<br/><br/>While I suppose ""Lords of Dogtown"" (2005) is a sports flick, it's just as much a coming-of-age movie detailing growing-up on the bad side of Venice, aka Dogtown, the birthplace of America's skateboard culture, which influenced the world.<br/><br/>It reminded me of the dissolute environment depicted in ""River's Edge"" (1986) with elements of Jim Morrison's hedonistic misadventures from ""The Doors"" (1991), but combined with skateboard action, like skating in dry backyard pools and various competitions. It's a good movie with slightly amped-up events (so what else is new?), but somewhat hampered by a curiously dismal air with occasional dialogues that don't work. Maybe I found it slightly depressing because it reminded me of the glory & shame of my teen years. The 70's soundtrack is great, however.<br/><br/>The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area, including Venice Beach, Imperial Beach and Santa Monica.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-"
"StevePulaski","6","0","2","15 July 2012"," Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight...
","It's the early 1970's in Santa Monica, California. Long, sun-bleached hair, bad-boy mentalities, and lawless behavior were things that attracted the girls, and daredevils seemingly lurked around every street-corner, boasting a life of dysfunctional mishaps and isolation. It is when a skateboard-designer named Skip Engblom was given polyurethane wheels for his boards that allowed a skateboarder to have the ability to ""climb walls"" and defy gravity did he get the bold idea that him and his surfer friends could revolutionize the activity, thus implementing a whole new kind of skating.<br/><br/>The teens that pioneered this life were Skip (Heath Ledger), Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), Stacy Peralta (John Robinson), and Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch). What assisted in their discoveries and possibilities was the ongoing drought that plagued most of the California area during the time, forcing nearby residencies to drain their pools. This led to the discovery that empty pools could be used as a good source of ramps and tricks. I believe it is a tradition that skateparks today have something like this on-location. Not only did the boys find popularity with the ladies, but were attracted to the business side of skating, where it is no longer innocuous riding, but an activity of skill and recklessness that only few are willing to pursue head-on.<br/><br/>Lords of Dogtown explores this era in time, and pulls us along for a ride similar to what the protagonists in the film embarked on. The real Stacy Peralta penned the screenplay for the film and manages to give us a taste at what life was like during this time period.<br/><br/>The two immediate things to laud about the film are its use of cinematography and extremely well-crafted soundtrack. The cinematography combines a high-contrast color scheme, complimented with grainy, documentary-like sequences of skating providing the viewer with a seemingly authentic experience. A wide variety of shots are utilized and explored, and we even get a nice look under the boards to examine the wheels doing what they do. Furthermore, the shot-variety is topped off with heavy-metal rock songs taken from all over the grid, again, giving the viewer a rather accurate depiction of the time period. This is one of those movies where the music adds a lot to the tonal aspect of the experience, and it helps out more than impressions would believe.<br/><br/>We are given a cast of capable actors as well. Emile Hirsch, a talent still underrated and unsung to this day, gives a great performance as the reckless bad-boy, John Robinson, who I adored in Gus Van Sant's long forgotten Elephant, gives a performance of memorable status, and the same can be said for Victor Rasuk. Yet, the highlight here is inevitably Heath Ledger, giving a raw and realistic portrayal of a skateboarding prodigy. He was apparently drunk or under heavy substances during filming and I can say that this definitely helped the role - although it probably isn't recommended.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, who worked behind the camera for the excellent film, Thirteen, which centered around a good girl gone bad when she met an underprivileged friend at school. Nikki Reed, the supporting actress of that film, returns here in a rather underwritten role as one of the main love interests. Lords of Dogtown seems to have all the pieces here, but what it forgets is to build on the story lines of these kids and their friends. We get many sequences of hardcore skating, scenes of them running from police, and scenes of competition, but never do we get simple scenes of talking. Writer Stacy Peralta either figures that viewers have seen the documentary, Dogtown and Z-Boys, which serves as the pseudo-predecessor to this film or believes that teenagers and skaters aren't interested in healthy, descriptive monologues. Correct me if I'm wrong, for I'm not a skater, but aren't many skaters emphasizing that they are often misunderstood because of societal stereotypes and are repeatedly ostracized? Aren't they sometimes looked at as the scum and pariahs of their community? I believe that some monologues about acceptance and societal visions would've fit well in this film, yet, alas, there are very few.<br/><br/>As for Dogtown and Z-Boys, I've read numerous times online that in order to fully appreciate this film, one must watch that one beforehand. Having not seen that at this point, I can still say I got enough enjoyment out of the film to warrant amusement and interest, but not a recommendation. The film's a bit indulgent and neglects to offer as much depth and structure as one would assume, with this being written by a skater portrayed in the film. With that being said, if one were to seek out a fictionalized account of a skater's trouble with society and social differences after an unexpected accident occurs, one could watch Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park, which illustrates this theme very carefully. I have just reviewed one marginally passable film and one of respectable quality. The choice is yours...<br/><br/>Starring: Heath Ledger, Emile Hirsch, John Robinson, Victor Rasuk, Michael Angarano, Johnny Knoxville, and Nikki Reed. Directed by: Catherine Hardwicke."

","I recognised the title of the film, but I had no idea what the story was about, or that it is based on true events. Basically it is all about a group of brilliant young skateboarders, known as the Z-Boys, raised in the mean streets of Dogtown in Santa Monica, California. They are perfecting their techniques in empty swimming pools of unsuspecting suburban homeowners, pioneering a thrilling new sport and taking part in skateboard contests. Starring The Girl Next Door's Emile Hirsch as Jay Adams, Victor Rasuk as Tony Alva, John Robinson as Stacy Peralta, Michael Angarano as Sid, Nikki Reed as Kathy Alva, Heath Ledger as Skip, Rebecca De Mornay as Philaine, Johnny Knoxville as Topper Burks, Ugly Betty's America Ferrera as Thunder Monkey, the real Jay Adams as Party Guest, the real Tony Alva as Oregon Man at Party, Charles Napier as Nudie, the real Stacy Peralta as TV Director, Tony Hawk as Astronaut, Alexis Arquette as Tranny, and a special appearance by YouTube star Tillman the skateboarding bulldog.

"deepfreezevideo","6","0","1","5 March 2008"," A great film but major holes!
","I'd give this a rating of nine if Stacey had given respect to some more of the historical and influential figures in the lives of these guys. He was more than happy to use tons of Hal Jepsen's film footage in both the docco and in the movie but no he made no story representation of this zany surf film icon whatsoever, not even a veiled one, and the truth is, without Hal's exposure the legend of these guys would not be the same. Hal wasn't making these guys their cheeseburgers, he was making the very films that helped catapult them to fame and fortune.<br/><br/>Hal was pretty much the first person to document them on film, and thus his work served as a root from which this entire tree owes much of its growth.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other historical figures who were dissed as well, and I could go on and on but I realize that those who knew the scene and those who were there know already, so why waste time in this forum trying to educate others when they will either find out for themselves or won't really care.<br/><br/>The film was excellent, wonderfully made and very entertaining, and it had some of the gritty street feel in both the cinematography and in the storyline. I actually appreciated the disjointed feel because it matched the lives of these people.<br/><br/>But again, leaving out folks like Jep, Dittrich, Rolloff, Ganzer, Robbie Dick et al is like leaving out Pacific Ocean Park. NO SoCal surf or skate story is complete or right without homage to these gents because while Stacey and the boys were the skaters to be sure, it is both disingenuous and greasy to have left out the very people who championed them the hardest. I don't care if Peralta had personal feelings about Jep's drinking or other personal faults...the facts is still the facts, and Stacey should have done right by these old surf gangstas. <br/><br/>I was there, I worked with Hal, I met some of the Z-Boys and knew one or two and I therefore feel qualified to fill in the blanks that Stacey left out.<br/><br/>Thanks for listening."

We considered ourselves lucky when one of us came across a VHS tape, in poor visual quality, of skateboarding tricks and rides. So now with the doc's, games, dvds, and now this movie I think mainstream America is realizing that there may be more to skateboarding than just outsiders,four wheels and a board.

","Every time i see this movie it makes me want to do 2 things. One; get out my skate-board and hit the town. two; Admire heath Ledger's performance. Of all the characters Skip is by far the most memorable and believable. Ledger does some great work here. The way he walks, talks, and addresses to people is just brilliant. The bets bits in the movie are the ones he is in. Frankly i didn't give a damn about Stacy or whatever.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsh also deserves a special mention and Viktor Rasuk was able to do some great skate in such a small amount of time. johnny Knoxville is also convincing in his small role.<br/><br/>But the movie has to many flaws, the script is too predictable and there is a lack of surprise in almost every aspect approached by the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion it seems to me that the only reason we should remember this movie is by the amazing work Ledger does. I'm my opinion he will soon become one of the most respected actors. His work in this movie, Brokeback Mountain, Candy, Monsters Ball and even Casanova is excellent. God why did he do ""The Order""....<br/><br/>Best bit: The scene in the skat-board competition where ledger almost gets in a fight with the opposite team, and the whole party where Skip loses it.<br/><br/>Worst bit: The movie never develops any character so its only a scratch on the surface"

","This is a great movie for people who already know the true story but difficult to follow for those who don't. I also felt that it could have gone back just a little further to address how this group of skaters came together in the first place. However, the story lines away from skating were interesting and there are some great cameo performances including Mitch Hedberg's last. The soundtrack is great though it could have included a little of the punk influence that was part of this same scene. I liked the movie but it was hard to follow; there is a great documentary about this era in skating that I would suggest watching first."

Repeating lines from the movie, or even weeks after seeing the movie, still thinking about it. I loved the movie and would recommend anyone to check it out. Each character was interesting and different from the other. Had there own backgrounds and problems. I can't wait to buy the DVD so I can watch it over and over again.

"jpking-1","9","0","12","23 October 2005"," Lords of Dogtown
","by Chris Weseman.<br/><br/>The story is about three boys making their way from poor to rich. The story is a true story (with a little Hollywood put in it) and has action, drama, romance, and some comedy. Both parents and kids would enjoy this movie. For the kids there was the action and skateboarding and for the parents and adults there's the soundtrack and the 70's vibe that they can relate to.<br/><br/>Most of the action is the skateboarding, surfing, and fights that happened. The skateboard contests and the training have the most action. An example of the action is when they drain peoples' pools so they can skateboard and they have to run from the police.<br/><br/>There is a lot of drama in the movie. Most of it is just about their lives, going from poor dogs to the ""Z-Boys"". The main drama is when they all go their separate ways (Tony and Stacy join different skate teams and Jay joins a street gang). I won't give away the ending but I will just say they find out what the boys really want.<br/><br/>There is only a little bit of romance and comedy. The romance would have to be the couples and break ups. Stacy starts to date Tony's little sister, but he doesn't feel comfortable doing stuff with her in front of her brother and things start breaking apart for them. Then someone else comes in and he and Tony's sister start cheating on Stacy.<br/><br/>The one bit of comedy I can think of is was when Tony got ""patty-slapped"" by Skip at the fast food restaurant.<br/><br/>It was a really good movie and I liked it a lot. I think most people would like it."
"JoshtheGiant","8","0","12","22 October 2005"," Extremely and Surprisingly Fun
","Lords of Dogtown is a extremely fun picture, a pure blast of energy, every second is worth watching. And after saying all this I have to say I hate skateboarding with a passion. The film could have focused simply on the skateboarding, and would have been a cult classic for skateboarders between the ages of 12 and 15, but would be hated by anyone else. Instead it focuses on the characters making it interesting to everyone, and a great movie. The story is very good, it is about the guys who redefined skateboarding, making it more of a sport than a way to get from place to place, more like surfing. The screenplay has very good dialogue and characters, and is put together almost perfectly. The acting is genius, Emile Hirsch and Heath Ledger both should get Oscar nominations, everyone else is also good, but not as good. The direction is great, she has decided to shoot it all with a hand-held camera, and that was a perfect idea. The visual effects are very good, almost every part is good. A good film for everyone even adults."
"gmeluski","7","0","11","15 October 2005"," Entertaining
","My first thought upon seeing the movie was that it was very entertaining. The skate shots are fun and the story moves quickly.<br/><br/>A more experienced actor certainly could have brought more depth to Jay's character. The real man seems to have a lot going on inside his head, it would have been great to show that to a mainstream audience.<br/><br/>The makers of the film made no bones about this being a fictionalized version of the DogTown and Z-Boys story. Anyone who criticizes the film for missing certain factual aspects should ask a friend about DogTown and ZBoys. It's in the documentary section.<br/><br/>I never felt as though the story was being manipulated to make one of the three main skate rats cooler or better or more in the right than the other. I think the flimmakers tried to show three different aspects of the skating lifestyle. Peralta is the commercial skater, Alva is the rock star, and Adams is the hardcore badass. If they explored the dichotomy between the three a bit more, it would have been great, but there was a lot of ground to cover in the film. To boot, real life is never that obvious.<br/><br/>Respect to the fact that the filmmakers showed Peralta being punked without trying to justify his lack of aggression.<br/><br/>All in all, definitely worth watching. A more experienced crew of actors and filmmakers could have brought more depth to the story."

","well were do i start this is a movie about skaters + surfers contain some gnarly waves + good skate scenes . although this mainly focuses on Stacey Peralta (mainly because he wrote it)but it does contains some facts + not just made up stuff . i really liked it because it has a good story + some really fit people which is always a plus=) . basically its shows how skateboarding has changed + how not everyones stays the same + that fame + money can sidetrack people from the fun of skateboarding.it starts off with some people who are friends that surf but when the waves aren't fit to ride they skate. the local surf shop starts a team with them they all go to a freestyle competition all but Peralta who wasn't picked for the team. Stacey goes to the competition with no sponsor + wins because tony ( on the zephyr surf shop team ) would have won but he had a fight with the judge so Stacey scoops up first prize. after his good performance skip (head of zephyr team) decides to put him on the team. after a while their team becomes famous and local tycoon takes on tony (part of zephyr)and tony gets fame + money + deserts the team one by one something happens to all the team until only Stacey is left Stacey then goes on to be big . at the biggest competition yet Stacey + tony go head to head but Stacey wins in the end one of their friends from zephyr gets a brain tumour + they all realise that they shouldn't of forgot why they started skating but he ends up dieing."

"hungwellac","7","0","13","4 October 2005"," Headed out to rent Z-boys.
","I rented LODT and watched it last night. I was very pleased with it considering the minuscule time it spent in theaters. The people portrayed in this film were many of my idols as a teen. I still own my original Alva board with Tracker trikes and SIMS pure juice wheels. This film brought back many pleasant personal memories of team t-shirts, skate contests and ugly clothes.<br/><br/>Many of you who have not yet seen this film may watch it and see it as ""disjointed"". That is a valid opinion but IMHO is probably a deliberate thing rather than a mistake. One of the things that Dog Town brought to skating was a certain wildness. Most of us in the ""over 30"" bracket today can look back on our own lives as teens and see that we were disjointed, unorganized, or maybe even a little frantic. Maybe my on recollection of the events, shadowed by my own experiences of the time, fill in some of the rougher spots and hide the more glaring faults but I still found enough of a contiguous plot to satisfy.<br/><br/>I do agree that the invention of the ""Arial"" (getting air off the top of the pool or ramp) should have been emphasized a bit more. Maybe it was skimmed over deliberately because it was not a Peralta thing but more a Alva/Adams thing and Stacy helped make the movie. I do know that once those wheels left the ramp, no skate contest was ever the same again. For the rest of the time I skated actively (into the early 80's) the quality of your air was THE definition of how good a skater you were.<br/><br/>So I have given this movie a 7. If you are or were a skater you will like it a bit better but even if you don't know what a skateboard is, you should be able to appreciate some of the elements of this movie. As for me personally, I am off to rent Z-boys to do some comparisons of my own."

","This is a very entertaining movie which gives us entrée into a world that we haven't seen before in 1000 other films...With an excellent cast, including a near-Oscar caliber performance by Emile Hirsch as Jay Adams. The script doesn't go into a lot of depth into each of the skater's individual lives, but enough is suggested for the viewer to understand the background of Peralta, Adams and Alva. These three young actors do an amazing job, and the skating is integrated into the story and never feels like it goes on too long. Give this movie a chance, even if you're not into skate boarding at all, and if you are, it is an absolute MUST. Unrated version is just slightly bawdier in places, no nudity."

I came out that cinema feeling that i could be happy with what Hollywood hasn't trashed for instance i expected to see the actors pulling off super moves and be the best of friends forever and hold hands (you know the typical Hollywood glamorisation) but instead i was treated to almost the real Zephyr boys there characters at least doing there original moves and just generally being portrayed to a good standard. I will say though you can definitely see it was written by Stacie Paralta he gets quite a good lime-light in this. Somethings were exaggerated somethings were left out or added but generally i could have expected a lot worse from Hollywood. This film gets my vote."

","I think that the Lords of Dogtown was a wonderfully well put together movie. Everything from the opening scene the the ending was perfect. Hardawicke (director) captured that time period perfectly. I love that the opening shows the boys leaving their houses around 5 am to go surfing and how the older locals wouldn't let them. The movie captured the right essence.<br/><br/>Props to Emile Hirsch for acting better than I have ever seen him act. He was great in movies like The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, but he was even better in Dogtown. He captured who Jay Adams was at that time. The audience could feel the anger he felt inside..also the sadness that he carried. Emile gets two thumbs up from me! Another great actor in this was Heath Ledger as Skip. He had even the way the real Skip would walk and talk down. I was amazed at his performance. That is another two thumbs up from me.<br/><br/>All of the other actors in this did wonderful as well. I just feel that Heath and Emile did the best.<br/><br/>If you have ever seen the documentary ""Dogtown and the Z-boys"" this movie follows it perfectly, but in movie form. It is not just about skating, it has heart and feeling. It shows what money and fame can do to friendships. If you like this movie, I would recommend 'Almost Famous.' The last shot of them all skating in the pool is just perfect! Please, give this movie a chance!"

","I may be overrating this movie by a point- but I give it a 9 out of 10. Yes, I did like John Robinson, Victor Rasuk, and Emile Hirsch before seeing the movie- but I think even if I hadn't- this would still be one of my favourite movies! The movie, created by Stacy Peralta himself, tells the story (of course) with Stacy being the smart one, Jay being the ""bad-ass"", and Tony being the one with too much bravado. It's starts out with a very strong beginning, and picks up a lot of details about each character's life and how each of them live... the climax leaves you awaiting a very dramatic ending. *_* Sorry- but that doesn't happen. There's a twist in the end with a minor character's (Sid) sensitive hearing turning into brain cancer. That brings the characters back together, and the ending is a warm and mushy reunion. Not what I expected. I mean the movie was about two hours long they could've given the ending more thought.

","This was one of the best movies this year. I am a teenage girl and i admit that i originally went to see this movie to see Emile Hirsch who i thought was hot. Within the first half hour of watching it I was sucked into the story of the film and my friend and I no longer turned to look at each other with raised eyebrows when Emile(who plays Jay) came on the screen. The acting was very well done, with little known actors so that the characters seemed more real and there was little confusion at the beginning by holding them to their previous roles, since i had seen only one movie with one of them in it. Heath Ledgar even does a great job. He realistically played this role and left all his bomb movies and chick-flicks behind. When the movie ended everyone in the theater (sadly only about a dozen of us, though it was Monday about lunch time) just stayed in their seats. Everyone seemed to be as floored as me and my friend. The fact that it was a movie was forgotten, and we sat there to really soak in the story. The fact that footage of the real Lords of Dogtown were played during the credits had us staying even longer. Such a wonderfully done film that surprised me as it did many others. If you thought that the previews for this movie seemed a little weak, do not be fooled, it was a great movie. I actually loved it so much i went out and bought the soundtrack. My dad shortly afterwords took it and put it in the car to listen to since he grew up with all of the great music on the album. I highly recommend seeing this movie, and i am about to go see again in a couple days with some new friends to introduce them to a wonderful movie. Don't be put off by not liking skateboarding or surfing. I am unable to do either, and don't like watching it really but this movie is about so much more than just introducing skateboarding to the masses. It's about the feeling of the 70s and how a group of teenagers were given a change to live their life doing what they love and portraying the ideals of the time so well. Guys and girls will both love this movie, so will older people that grew up in the 70 and the teenagers of today."

","LORDS OF DOGTOWN (2005) *** John Robinson, Emile Hirsch,Victor Rasuk, Heath Ledger, Rebecca De Mornay, Michael Angarano, Nikki Reed, William Mapother, Julio Oscar Mechoso, Johnny Knoxville, America Ferrera, Elden Henson, Eddie Cahill, Sofia Vergara. (Dir: Catherine Hardwicke)<br/><br/>The Lords of Venice Beach<br/><br/>A few years back skateboarding legend Stacy Peralta chronicled his lifestyle and groundbreaking extreme sport with the awesome documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" showing the origins of the pastime from surfing to concrete daredevilry with deft aplomb. In Catherine Hardwicke's ballsy, feckless drama Peralta gets to requiem his co-horts by depicting his heady youth with all its splendor (and pitfalls).<br/><br/>Peralta  who wrote the screenplay  is depicted in his teens in the mid-70s by Robinson, a nice young kid whose shyness was belied by his gifted skateboarding skills and the enclave of those who excelled at it in the wanton exuberance of California's skate-rat Venice Beach where his pals, Jay Adams (Hirsch quickly becoming a Leonardo DiCaprio star-in-the making) and Tony Alva (Rasuk, the star of the indie hit ""Raising Victor Vargas"") attempted to make names for themselves among the surfing population including surfer enthusiast and entrepreneur Skip Engblom (Ledger getting in touch with his inner Val Kilmer with stony goofy perfection) whose skateboard shop, Zephyr, became a kind of haven for the local teens to hang between hanging ten.<br/><br/>Then one glorious day the kids are given new polyurethane wheels for their skateboards and with a few innovations make for some radical changes and discovering the empty pools of Southern California to be a perfect place to advance their athleticism to amateur (and later professional) competitions. <br/><br/>The film focuses on the three friends (and another one, Sid, a rich kid with an inner ear problem that ruins his chances to be great, played by Angarano) and their problems and dreams equally (Jay's mom  played nicely with ravaged beauty by De Mornay  is a stoner who is slowly downward spiraling their life to nowhere; Tony's tough yet loving father instilling some hard knocked life lessons; etc.) but mainly exhibits the adrenalizing joy the trio share when all they want is to surf air and live on summer vacation for the next 20 years.<br/><br/>As the years progress and the skateboard craze comes to a head the three buddies learn that getting what you want has its price. The crazily self-assured Alva is heading for a nasty fall when he goes into business with the pimpified nemesis of Skip's, huckster manager Topper Burks (humorously played by Knoxville as a first cousin to Kid Rock) promising him all sorts of glories and riches. Meanwhile the disillusioned Jay resorts to gangs and punk rock to exert his inner demons while Peralta becomes so mainstreamed that he even appears on ""Charlie's Angels"" (!)<br/><br/>Written by Peralta, the film hits home the lost youth the skaters faced and the pressures to maintain their thrill-seeking techniques while attempting to have a life is nicely balanced with the carefree, devil-may-care recklessness of growing up is all about: rebel against everything without losing everything; a truly tricky maneuver.<br/><br/>Filmed with a fluid, on-the-money vibe by Hardwicke (who helmed the indie hit ""Thirteen"")  a self-proclaimed surfing/skating enthusiast herself and gaining the gig after executive producer filmmaker David Fincher bailed on helmsing due to financial and stylistic disagreements on making the film a reality  achieves an entertaining, never dull biopic disguised as an extreme sports documentary that echoes Peralta's earlier work yet still shines thanks to her young, exuberant cast and excellent you-are-there cinematography by Elliot Davis. <br/><br/>For someone like yours truly who has no athletic skill or desire to try to break every bone in his body this film truly works on all levels of participating without actually breaking a sweat (or aforementioned skeletal part) and should thrill those who feel the same or inspire those who do not."
"Chris Knipp","8","0","13","4 June 2005"," Gnarly live
","Movies of this kind aren't usually this good. They tend to look cheesy and have corny plots that slink toward clichéd payoffs. ""Lords of Dogtown"" instead has compelling cinematography and staging, a dynamic, non-stop physicality, and consistently fine acting. In the end, don't expect profundity or perfection, but do look for the strong evocation of a lifestyle and an era. In the Seventies when skateboarding first exuded magic and became a maverick sport with stars, a whole school of wide angle photography grew up to do justice to their gravity-defying feats for skateboard magazines, and this film is shot with wide angle lenses to evoke that look and capture the feats appropriately.<br/><br/>Front and center there's a cast that delivers. As Skip, the gnarly, drunken surfboard shop owner who starts the Venice Zephyrs team on the path to skateboard greatness, Heath Ledger, out of chain mail and away from romantic lighting, is deep into his character and evidently having lots of fun. In fact it's clear everybody working on the picture had a ball. Emile Hirsch, playing badboy spark to the whole sport Jay Adams, shows again what a gifted actor he is: his pouting, sensuous performance is something to watch. John Robinson, the poster boy for Van Sant's Elephant, is Stacy Peralta, the straight-arrow of the trio of stars who emerge, whose real life counterpart wrote the film script and made the earlier documentary ""Dogtown and Z Boys."" With his gorgeous long straight blond hair, peaches-and-cream cheeks, and Colgate smile, he's a perfect skateboarding valedictorian and a commanding and deft physical presence in what is totally a movie about balls, individualism, and grace. Victor Rasuk, who starred in the lovely little coming of age film ""Raising Victor Vargas,"" rises to the very different task here of being the bold, commercial, flashy Mexican American Tony Alva, skateboarding's first world champion. As Jay's sad surf sister burnout mom, Rebecca de Mornay is brave and believable. Ledger and Hirsch walk away with the acting prizes but John Robinson and the other principals are striking presences. These strong, distinctive performances are part of an energetic ensemble piece with many minor unnamed characters seamlessly filling in the background.<br/><br/>In her debut Thirteen, director Catherine Hardwicke showed her ability to eavesdrop realistically on at-risk teenagers and their maturity-challenged parents. Dogtown isn't such a different milieu, but it's also a history of how skateboarding became popular and, for some, worth a lot of money.<br/><br/>Hardwicke famously did a literal headbanger in an empty swimming pool while directing the movie and was out for several minutes, scaring skateboarding crew members, who afterward declared, ""Now you're one of us."" ""Lords of Dogtown"" is a direct companion piece to Peralta's documentary, whose story it brings to vivid life. The decaying Venice pier looms over the early scenes. It's a kind of off limits surfing slum where the boys and their chicks dash to ride waves between pylons and rocks. They jump off a roof, stop traffic, and skateboard down to the ocean in the first high-kinetic shots with long Seventies surfboards in hand. Only Peralta, excluded from the Zephyrs at first for having a job, drives his own car. Their parents are alcoholic burnouts and they come from sleezy little surfside broken homes except for young Sid, a baby-faced poor little rich boy and ""maggot,"" the dedicated dogbody and punching bag at the surfboard shop, with an inner ear problem, a camp follower who turns into the ""family's"" beloved mascot and martyr.<br/><br/>Once they enter competitions with an earthy new style of skateboarding and athletic gifts that blow away the crowds and turn on the girls, one by one the Zephyr's stars are lured away from the ""family"" by well funded promoters. Jay rejected that path. One day Jay shaves off his bleach-blond tresses and becomes a punk. Ultimately he went to jail like later skateboard stars Mark Anthony 'Gator' Ragowski, who was documented in Helen Sickler's ""Rise and Fall of Gator,"" and the once dashing Christian Hosoi. Jay lures away Stacy's foxy Latina girlfriend in a stunning sequence of coy playfulness and sinuous movements: the dudes' physicality flows out of their derring-do on wheels into their moves with the girls.<br/><br/>There are accidents, beatings, triumphs, and a tragic death. Through it all Heath Ledger as Skip is a buzzing obligato, crazy, stoned, funny but also threatening. Another thread in the film is the raids on rich people's empty pools to skate them in long, flowing, interwoven infinity signs, till little lookouts yell ""pig"" or ""dog"" and they all flee, knocking down cops in their path. These bold dangerous runs, worth it for the thrill of the concrete curves and the challenge to explore new shapes, are a badge of the Z Boys' ""pirate"" outlaw identity and Tony Alva, a closing title declares, continues to raid pools today as an enduring star and amazing lifelong athlete.<br/><br/>I don't know if the actors do a lot of their own skateboarding but if they don't Hardwicke sure makes it look like they do. She also has a way of jumping into sequences already in progress, thus avoiding clumsy exposition, except for a few titles for landmark competitions. The movie escapes the stilted flavor of its genre and gets in a lot of real-sounding dialogue and facial expressions instead. The final sequence is a touching reunion that's both funny and sad."

","I just came from seeing this film. Even though I'm a mid-30s So Cal female, I must admit I knew nothing of the Z-boys and wouldn't have even thought of seeing this movie if the reviews weren't as positive as they are. I actually purchased the fabulous soundtrack first (all '70s era hard rock hits) and then saw the movie. It's wonderful. The look of the film is gritty and very realistic, including beautiful shots of surfers surfing in between the pylons of an old abandoned pier. The three teen-aged boys that form the heart of the story are given distinct personalities and are well developed. This is a coming of age story in many ways, but done realistically and without the lectures. The boys deal with their new found fame in different ways, which has consequences for their future lives. There's also a very emotional storyline involving the boys' fourth friend. The casting is superb. They're unknown to me, but I was caught up in their performances. Their youthful bravado and irreverence are infectious. Heath Ledger's character is a bit unsavory, but he disappears into the role. It was beautifully filmed, had fine direction, wonderful dialog, was fast paced, and had a kick-a$$ soundtrack. To sum it up, I never skateboarded in my life, but this movie makes me feel as if I missed something really cool."

For those who don't know, this film chronicles the rise of the legendary Zephyr skate team (Z-boys), a ragtag band of goofy, rebellious, but still likable kids who turn the skateboarding world on its head through their innovative new tricks, and by being the first to skate in empty pools. It's always seemed to me that someone else had probably come up with that idea already, but these guys were just the first ones to take credit for it. Whatever. It's funny how Stacy Peralta, who wrote this script, is the only person in the film who remains squeaky-clean and likable the entire time, and never develops any kind of ego or attitude problem. The soundtrack, which features the likes of David Bowie, T. Rex, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and other sweet 70's longhair rock, is fantastic. Too bad the best songs in the film (two Stooges songs and one by Funkadelic) aren't actually on the soundtrack CD. The only negative regarding the music is when some lame modern-day punk band actually appears in the film butchering ""Nervous Breakdown"", the best song by one of the punkest bands ever (that'd be Black Flag, for all you kids who aren't in the know). Still, I'd advise the younger kids of today to pick up the soundtrack. It would be really great if instead of looking like homeboys and listening sissy-ass boy bands posing as ""punk rock"" singing whiny songs about girls, kids today started growing their hair long, smoking tons of dope, and listening to Sabbath. Anyway, I'll end this awful review by recommending this film to anyone interested in skateboarding or pop culture history, and to kids with awful taste in music who need to be steered right. Not amazing, but I have seen much worse. This one's about a 6."

","My 40 something ex dragged me to this skater flick because he was a contemporary of these guys and by the time it was over I was raving about it. I too was a teen in the 70's and this movie is a master period piece...I will be waxing nostalgic for days to come! So many great cameos and the acting by the young cast is the most memorable I have seen in years. I would hope it becomes a cult classic. Emile Hirsch and Heath Ledger should definitely receive acting nods by Golden Globe if not Oscar. The acting across the board is really terrific.<br/><br/>But the coolest thing is the cinematography. Some of it is a little jumpy, but it really works for the most part. Moreover, though, is the authentic feel of the period, the location shots and the way Hardwicke captures LA and these amazing actors.<br/><br/>Definitely a summer must see...it is the story and the boys that pull you in...great."

","I've probably watched the Dogtown documentary (2002) at least 15 times. I wasn't expecting greatness from the feature film version, mainly because so much of the brilliance of the documentary comes from the raw charisma of the skaters themselves. Jay Adams and Tony Alva, in particular, are so intense that their personalities jump off the screen just in photographs. It's an amazing fact about the documentary that it tells their story mostly in still photos and still manages to capture their movement (both in the form of individual skating and as a collective cultural force).<br/><br/>The film Lords of Dogtown starts off a little shaky, with the actors seeming to be feeling out their roles with some awkward dialogue and stagy setups. But the movie started to win me over when I realized what a surprisingly decent job the actor Emile Hirsch was doing with the character of Jay Adams. This was the role that I thought would be impossible to fill-- Jay was the original, essential child of California in all his natural beauty, talent, and exceptionality. As one article in a skateboarding magazine put it, he has the ""crazy gleam"" in his eye that can't be replicated. When you see that gleam, you know you're dealing with someone whose craziness is genuine, not affected. And somehow Emile Hirsch pulls it off, with the perennially pursed lips and half-smile and cock-eyed hazel gaze and intense focus. He even got the voice right-- kind of breathy, quiet, slightly mocking, like it might equally be whispering a threat, a flirtation, or a wry piece of wisdom.<br/><br/>I loved the cameo by the real Jay Adams in the party scene at Jay's mom's house.<br/><br/>So the film went way beyond my expectations with Hirsch's performance. TA's representation, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. But Jay was the character they had to nail. So I give it an 8/10. Nice film, nice work. For really inspiring skate footage and thought-provoking interviews with the skaters themselves, check out the documentary."

","Just like ""A New Hope"", ""Lords of Dogtown"" is breathless and exhilarating and manages to be poignant in its conclusion. It takes a cadre of talented filmmakers to make a fictional feature film seem nearly as real as its documentary predecessor (which I saw during its theatrical run). I would like to refute the review of the ""Unemployed Critic"" who seems to carry a ""gravitas"" of his own and is NOT a filmmaker. The feminine touches added by director Catherine Hardwicke are a great counterpoint to Stacy Peralta's story and are not lost on the women in the audience. Not all movies are ""cinema"" - some of them are ""films"" and they bring some joy into your life. I believe this one will."
