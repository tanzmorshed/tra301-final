","It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see ""The English Patient"" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In ""Breaking And Entering"" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in ""The English Patient"", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a ""Minghellian"" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind."
"Nazi_Fighter_David","9","128","167","28 May 2001"," A masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse...
","'The English Patient' is a love story set in Europe as World War II ends... It is a wartime romance mystery epic, like 'Hiroshima, Mon Amour,' 'The Sweet Hereafter,' and 'After Life.' Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque, and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience...<br/><br/>This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'Casablanca' and 'Dr. Zhivago.' The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed... Told in flashback, it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse...<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, Count Laszlo de Almasy, a Hungarian cartographer of few words, who works for the British government, and is stationed in the North African desert...<br/><br/>Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies, taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy, and essentially left to die in peace, in an isolated monastery in Tuscany, under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine, and reads to him a book, considered his great treasure, and his one surviving possession...<br/><br/>Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories, wrapped up in his head, released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind...<br/><br/>Fiennes gives a haunted, pained performance, playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion... He makes us sympathize with the character in showing self-doubt and weakness... As a badly burned man, he has only cherished memories... His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes... He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman... He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love... His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture...<br/><br/>Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality... She is captivating as the married European woman, conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible... Their different world, despairing and hopeful, menacing and resilient, is simply beautiful... With intense passion and intelligence, this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife...<br/><br/>Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the French-Canadian nurse full of life and energy... This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold, kissing wounded soldiers, but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her...<br/><br/>Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent... He quickly becomes friend of the Count, yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery, his face reflected a peaceful fury...<br/><br/>William Dafoe plays a double-agent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm... He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda... This cunning Canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in Almasy's past... He believes the 'English patient' is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands, and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved...<br/><br/>Naveen Andrews is Hana's ardent lover He is a handsome Sikh, and an explosives expert with a dangerous job There's a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an eternity In this particular scene, the military sapper has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a bridge It's on a timer and he only has a few minutes left The scene cuts back and forth between his tense face, the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the bomb <br/><br/>All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in ""The English Patient."" John Seale's cinematography is breathtaking, and Gabriel Yared's majestic music is dreamy, and romantic This is a rich motion picture with ambition and style, a fever dream, lyrical and complex We are almost able to feel the heat of the desert, the pain of the burnings, the intimate flush of humanity that becomes the most haunting element of this epic love story..."

","I can understand why some people think this movie is boring. I think it appeals much more to people who are used to the pacing of classic books.<br/><br/>I'm sure many of those who hated it are much like a co-worker of mine who said ""Books? I haven't a book since I had to in high school."" I checked some of the names of the people who reviled this movie and sure enough it seems many of them think Armaggedon was an ""awesome"" movie and Chris Farley was a ""Comic genius"". And that's O.K. Taste is an individual thing.<br/><br/>My sensibilities tell me that the english patient is a very good movie that takes effort to appreciate. Much in this movie is very subtle. It is not a vacation for the brain.(Hey, sometimes the brain NEEDS a vacation, and stupid movies provide that!) Also, it is not a cynic's movie. It's about idealism, tragedy and regret. About how people can want the best but have it all fall apart because of bad choices, and have to go on with the regret of never being able to remedy the situation. Not so much a love story as a tragic one. So many people destroyed because of the selfishness of two people couldn't(wouldn't?) control themselves.<br/><br/>I would ask those who thought the movie boring to watch it again when you feel able to pay full attention to what's going on in the film and how different bits of dialogue dovetail into subtle suggestions of how the characters are feeling and thinking. This movie takes an investment of time, thought and emotion. If this investment is made, I think most people who watch it will feel rewarded."
"jhclues","10","208","280","29 July 2002"," A Magnificent Motion Picture
","In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set.  It's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances.  And thus is the situation in `The English Patient,' directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.<br/><br/>It's WWII; flying above the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. And though he survives the crash, he is severely burned.  To his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital.  But existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility.  Upon reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.<br/><br/>Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name.  Thought to be English, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient.  Slowly, however, under prompting from Hana, Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth).  And, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.<br/><br/>In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje.  The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's `Doctor Zhivago' and `Lawrence of Arabia'; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty.  Simply put, Minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a Monet come to life.  From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer.  In every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental.  Nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography.<br/><br/>If one had to choose a single word to describe the `essence' of this film, it would be `excellence.'  Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term `Oscar worthy.'  Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for `Shine'), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable.  Private and introspective, Almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him.  And it works.  Almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.<br/><br/>Kristen Scott Thomas, too, received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for `Fargo') for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her.  The reserve Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as Scott Thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect.  It's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion.  Understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by Kristin Scott Thomas.<br/><br/>Binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, Hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film.  Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine.  `The English Patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10."

","Sometimes I just don't get it with the ratings of the IMDb. I'm writing this review because I'm shocked to see this film at a 7.3 rating. This is so ridiculous. It is really hard to point out a film which is better told, better crafted, having a more deeply love-story and such a overall fascinating aura. I do understand that everything is a question of taste but this masterpiece is so full of beauty and drama that you simply can not rate it under 8. If you do not like it so much = 8 , if you like it = 9 and if you love it's pure beauty = 10 And now go and watch this movie. You wont regret it if you like romance and love story's and beautifully crafted films."
"mattymatt30","9","87","116","19 March 2004"," An epic tale of doomed love
","'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war.  The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas.<br/><br/>
  The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy  - the titular character.  The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers.     The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. If you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you."
"gordie02","9","105","143","20 January 2005"," as below
","I like this movie above all others. It is ""multi-layered""; there is so much to see and appreciate. Every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story-line, the plot and the characters. Faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in the sand storm where Catherine & El-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts. The other relationship between Hanna & El-masy is yet another ""layer"" of the movie which is totally enchanting (and heart-rending). A worthy winner of so many awards."
"labrang","9","106","146","8 November 2004"," a patience taking movie.. ;)
","as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions in between. I for one think that is a good sign. <br/><br/>I always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I never watched Titanic for instance, and am not planning to).<br/><br/>The English Patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are 'home' (Katherine), it shows how destructive love can be in a slow, strong and utterly painful way, it excites because of the extremely passionate affair, the pain of the one(s) who leave behind, how pointless one can feel to move on. <br/><br/>The photography is just stunning, not to mention the play of the actors. The pace is slow, but timely, and that does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth/development of the characters. To put this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multi-layeredness of this movie. People tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies... as if they are in a rush to get to work.. hey - get a life ! ;-) enjoy...<br/><br/>I give this movie 4.5 out of 5."
"inkblot11","10","98","138","7 March 2007"," One of the greatest achievements in all of cinema, peerlessly beautiful
","Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is horrifically burned from an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) tends to him, body and mind, for she fears, quite rightly, that he may be a very troubled soul. In the course of his care, the Count starts to tell Hana of his recent past. It seems he worked in a government capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine called it quits, leaving the Count desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, under heart-wrenching circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. Yet, the war is raging relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a tremendous film, based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully, each of them poignant beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions. As for Binoche, she richly deserved the Oscar that she was presented, as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The scenery is utterly gorgeous, as are the costumes, the direction, and the production. If you have missed out on viewing this film, rectify that soon, very soon. The English Patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in film for centuries to come."
"bob the moo","Null","99","143","26 February 2002"," Epic story that mixes lust with a mystery story  worthy stuff but a touch too slow
","Tuscany WW2.  Traumatised by the loss of anyone she cared for or loved, Canadian nurse Hana stays behind her unit with a dying patient, Count Laszlo de Almásy.  de Almásy is burnt all over and has lost his memory.  When a vengeful, mysterious thief arrives at their abandoned monastery with a past that seems to include de Almásy , and as Hana reads from his book, memories return regarding his past.  He relives his story of lust and love and the destructive force that forbidden passion unleashed upon his life.<br/><br/>This is quite a modern epic.  It has the running time of an epic, it has the gorgeous cinematography of an epic, it has the acting of an epic and it has a story of love (lust) against the backdrop of major events in history. Even though it changes or leaves out a significant amount of the original novel it still manages to be a great mix of passionate desire and mystery. The mystery of the story is represented by the thief Caravaggio who casts light on what he knows of de Almásy's past (as he sees it) while the love story is unfolded as it develops in a passionate affair between him and Katherine, a colleagues' wife.  The story is compelling enough to carry the long running time, at times the pace seems a little slow and when I saw it in my local multiplex there were some moments where large portions of the audience seemed to be shifting in their seats.<br/><br/>The love' of the story was interesting as it seems to be contrasted with Hana's relationship with Kip the bomb disposal expert.  While de Almásy's relationship with Katherine starts as lust and desire before growing into what seems to be love (or could be grief at the result of their affair), Hana's is portrayed as purer and more careful as she fears those she loves will die.  This difference helped me see that the film did want to show the destructive power of lust and affairs, however the fact that the central relationship was based more on lust than love took away from the emotional core of the story.<br/><br/>The acting is almost impeccable.  Fiennes is excellent even when he is lost behind an unrecognisable mask of burnt flesh.  Thomas is actually very good, I find she tends to be very wooden in some things but this type of very English character brings the best out of her.  Binoche is excellent as Hana and carries the heart of the film.  Dafoe is truly excellent - his element of the story is the mystery and he does it well.  He is a great actor and deserves to be in things this good.  The support cast include plenty of good actors including Colin Firth, Jurgen Prochnow and Naveem Andrews.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot - even though it's all a bit too picturesque to be real!  However the director can handle himself well with many different scenes - a tense bomb diffusal, a passionate love scene, a dangerous sand storm etc.  Overall the slow pace may frustrate some younger audiences but this is a really good film that draws it's values from classy sources."
"ackstasis","9","27","35","2 July 2007"," ""Every night I cut out my heart. But in the morning it was full again""
","Anthony Minghella's 'The English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards, the film owned the night, taking home nine awards from twelve nominations, the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of World War Two.<br/><br/>During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition, and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia, he is assumed to be an Allied soldier, and is simply referred to as ""the English patient."" After the war, in the mine-ridden hills of Italy, a kind nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who has apparently lost everybody close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time, she comes to learn more and more about her ""English patient,"" who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks, we learn of Almásy's former exploits in the Sahara desert, and his romantic liaison with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas).<br/><br/>It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film, blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Almásy's plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments, excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances from all the cast members.<br/><br/>A long-time favourite actor of mine, 'The English Patient' might just contain Ralph Fiennes' finest performance, and, considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener,' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character, but, as we slowly learn more about his past, his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. ""Ownership"" is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most, Almásy replies with ""Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me."" However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him, Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: ""I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine, which belong to me.""<br/><br/>Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for Almásy alone, she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and who suspects that it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb-diffuser in the British Army. However, due to her past history, Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death, particularly considering his very dangerous line of work.<br/><br/>At 160 minutes in length, 'The English Patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful, but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless, in every case, it is always better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all."

The character of the Count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed, the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted. The film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics all in one.

","TEP is like a long cool drink of water after crawling across the Sahara to classic film buffs who have been too long deprived of that certain cinematic magic!  Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly portrayed.  If you're looking for the film to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed.  Instead, it is an excellent ""companion"" to the book, and I think that is what Anthony Minghella intended.  Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; not to mention a brilliant actor.  Juliette Binoche is the posterchild for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm.  And, of course, I'll go see any film in which Kristin Scott Thomas is featured.  She simply must be THE best actress since the likes of Deborah Kerr.  So much was promised with this film, and so much is delivered!"
"lorraineesimpson","10","11","14","23 May 2015"," Perfection
","A grand, sweeping romance with more than a passing nod to the great epics like Lawrence of Arabia and Dr Zhivago, this is without doubt one of the best films of all time and deserved every one of it's 9 Oscars plus numerous other awards. <br/><br/>At the core of this film is the doomed love affair between Almasy and Katharine. Their relationship is totally believable, the dashingly handsome Fiennes and the luminously beautiful Kristen Scott Thomas have great on screen chemistry, perfectly conveying the exquisite pain and passion of falling in love with the wrong person. The sex scenes stay on the right side of erotic desire rather than the gratuitous groping which unfortunately tends to be the default position for movies nowadays. <br/><br/>The acting is universally excellent and the casting is flawless with everyone perfectly suited to their roles. Dafoe is a fine actor who has made some dire movies, but his role as David Caravaggio suits him perfectly. Colin Firth gives an understated and poignant performance as the slightly bumbling but desperately nice husband. Juliette Binoche, believable in every part she plays, gives a charmingly earthy performance as the caring nurse.<br/><br/>Wonderful cinematography produces a picture perfect backdrop bathed in a golden glow - the desert scenes in particular are a visual feast. Even the music is perfect.<br/><br/>It's rare for me to watch a film more than once - I've seen this one at least twenty times. I never tire of it and get something new from it every time I watch it."
"dead47548","10","17","24","9 January 2008"," An epic story of love.
","A passionate tale of determination and romance. Like with all of Minghella's work, every single character is so layered and complex. He takes time and devotion to give each character a sufficient amount of intricacy that we truly feel like we know these people and when one of them feels pain, we do as well. When one of them is joyous (the rain scene, for instance) our faces light up with glee.<br/><br/>There's Hana, the caring nurse who is too afraid of love to let anyone near her since right from the start the two closest people to her are destroyed by the war. Slowly her friendship with Almasy becomes stronger and stronger and it gives her the courage and determination to pursue a sexual relationship with Kip, who is also a very complex character. On the surface we see him as a kind man, who is very spiritual and loving. But near the end he realizes how isolated he is and the fact that he barely even knew his best friend whom he worked side by side with for years sends him into a complete breakdown. This leads to a very emotional scene, where Binoche really shines. Next up there is David Caravaggio, a spy who eventually gets captured and loses his thumbs while being tortured for information. He sets out on a vengeance to murder everyone connected to his capture, which leads him to Almasy, his final target. But being around Almasy and realizing the pain and suffering that he has been through leads him to look deep inside himself and realize that he doesn't need his revenge. He relieves himself of all this pain and anguish and in the end we see him with a bright grin, just happy to be alive, thumbs or not.<br/><br/>Katharine Clifton is a character very similar to those in the past, but she has an extra spark that makes her very unique. As her husband spends less and less attention to her, she becomes involved in a tumultuous love affair with Almasy which leads to some of the most beautifully romantic scenes ever brought to cinema. Minghella easily could have made her another whiny, confused housewife who just passed in and out of the film with no real connection the audience but he bestowed her with a certain grace and dignity which made us want her to have a happy ending and made us adore seeing her and Almasy enjoying each other's company. Even Geoffrey Clifton becomes a layered character when we learn that he isn't venturing off to do photographs, but is instead helping the army explore territory. So while he could have just been another ignorant husband to an adulterous wife, Minghella adds intricacy to him. And of course the entire story all revolves around Almasy, the man who would do anything, even sell out his country to the enemy, just to be with the woman he loved. A truly romantic and beautiful tale.<br/><br/>What I found very interesting, though, was how Minghella subtly displays the horrors and terrible effects that war has on the people that aren't even physically fighting it. Through Hana we see a woman who is permanently destroyed and almost unable to love due to the fact that this awful war took away everyone who became close to her. In Kip we see a man who is so blinded by his job and duty to his country that he never even takes the time to appreciate the man he considers his best friend. Caravaggio takes abuse after abuse, with unimaginable pain being inflicted on him as a result of the war. The Cliftons are a loving couple, who have no troubles whatsoever until the war starts and Geoffrey is off helping his country while Katharine becomes involved in an affair. But the most horrific effect of war is shown constantly through Almasy's story. All he wanted was love and companionship, but the war wouldn't allow him that. He only gets his love because of the war, and due to it's changing seriousness his love is ripped away from him and he falls into complete heartache. Then we see him reclaim this love, and he does whatever he can to save her life. But, as Binoche mentions early on the film, when war times come even your name means a great deal. We see this terribly through Almasy who is beaten, dragged away and arrested merely due to his name when all he was trying to do was save the woman he loved. Of course we see the effect of war physically through Almasy in the horrific burning of his entire body. This film shows no huge war scenes and terrible travesties that blow off limbs and open chest cavities, but it manages to send an anti-war message stronger than I've ever seen before. No physical battle is shown, whatsoever, yet it makes me absolutely detest war due to the effect that it has on those who aren't even directly involved.<br/><br/>As always for a Minghella work, the performances are absolutely brilliant. Fiennes, Binoche, Thomas and Dafoe deliver some of the best work of the decade. Simply through their eyes we can see all of the pain and emotion searing through them. The right actors were definitely cast in this one. We never hear them shout or break down into a ten minute fit of crying and throwing objects across the room, but we see all of their anguish and torture simply through their eyes and facial expressions. It's a beautifully subtle way of showing emotion and really helped make the film the brilliant masterpiece that it is. I highly doubt that any other cast could have pulled it off so seamlessly."

","Not in the top 250? Slow and broing?When I heard that this movie was ""slow and boring"" I thought I'd see for myself; so when I finally did last Saturday, there was not one moment when I was bored. The entire time I was watching, I just felt so...captivated and amazed at how amazing not only the story was but the acting was just perfect! I seriously do not understand why this is not in the top 250, it's one of the BEST romance movies, one of the best WWII movies, and a Best Picture win deserved 250%. All of the casting in this movie was just absolutely perfect, even if Fox would've preferred to cast ""well-known, American actors"" but they wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche or Willem Dafoe. Seeing Fiennes as this damaged, burn victim dying, and then seeing him before all of it shows how great and underrated of an actor he truly is, showing diversity right there but not only resting on the makeup. The story might seem like a ""typical love story"" but it's much more than that. Sure, there are tons of movies with this similar storyline, but the main reason this one stands out to me is because of how much passion is really told through it; how Almasy had to leave Katherine's body in the cave and let her die was the most heart-breaking scene from a movie that I'd seen in such a long time. A true masterpiece, even if it has been forgotten about now, this is a movie that I certainly will never forget, and Anthony Minghella, will never be forgotten either."

","I won't go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. That's fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it I believe...or you simply hate it. I don't want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very passionately about The English Patient, as well as millions of other people do. <br/><br/>The awards say it all. <br/><br/>I don't agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, I couldn't agree more.<br/><br/>9-Oscars. <br/><br/>41-wins.<br/><br/>37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. <br/><br/>From the director, Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, ""Elaine, I simply can't take my eyes off of it!"" In this instance, I don't agree with Elaine's response. But the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it's case beautifully. The cinematography,(John Seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, until now. Well, not entirely true I loved her performance in ""Sabrina"" Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, I'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! What can you say except, see this picture again. (*****)"
"TheUnknown837-1","8","14","20","26 May 2009"," despite a few flaws, ""The English Patient"" proves itself as an enthralling modern-day epic with that same sweeping sense that made movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia""
","One of the most charming and, for me at least, the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enthralling Best Picture-winner ""The English Patient"" is that, in the mid 90s, when Hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects, a film was created that brought back traces—very powerful traces—of the sweeping, wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) and ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). ""The English Patient"" contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"", based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like ""The Godfather: Part II"" (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been scarred for life by a plane crash, and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.<br/><br/>That's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.<br/><br/>To be blunt, ""The English Patient"" is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, how obsessive, how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories, such as Minghella's later ""Cold Mountain"" (2003), the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love, but still, because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of ""Vertigo"" (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other.<br/><br/>Performances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche, who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical, questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. And of course I can't leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers.<br/><br/>Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one, it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there, but in the film, it just seems a littledistracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside, ""The English Patient"" is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me, it was sort of like an insane mix up between ""Casablanca"" (1942) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence anybody needs."
"Susie-3","2","27","45","23 March 1999"," I don't get it.
","When I say I don't get it, I don't mean to imply that I didn't understand the movie.  What I don't get is why we are supposed to care about such unsympathetic, flat characters.  And I also don't get how this movie could possibly have won best picture; it is boring, overdone, and pretentious, and nice scenery does not make up for a lack of substance.  I did not care what happened to either Ralph Fiennes or Kristin Scott Thomas; neither one gave me any reason to care.  I agree with the comments that there is no indication that there was any real love here.  It looked like a case of raging hormones to me.  Are we given any reason why we should not despise KST for cheating on her husband over a prolonged period of time? No.  Are we given any reason why we should not despise Fiennes for sleeping with his best friend's wife over a prolonged period of time? No.  Are we given any reason why we should believe their relationship is based on anything more than lust? That scene at the Christmas dinner or whatever it was is a good example of how completely unlikable these characters were.  I did like the character played by Binoche, and I did care what happened to her and Andrews' character, but this relationship was barely touched on in the movie, though I understand it is more important in the book.  These characters were not despicable and showed more depth, and as far as I am concerned, they are the only reasons that this movie wasn't intolerable and completely without merit- other than the wonderful scenery, of course, which we are shown again and again and again.<br/><br/>I am not American (though I'm not sure if being Canadian is considered by many others to be more American-like or more European-like, or just different) and I am not male, and I don't see what these qualities have to do with anything anyway; a bad movie is a bad movie, and this was indeed a bad movie.  I don't need massive explosions or shoot-outs, nor do I need lots of sex (though this movie had plenty of that) in order to enjoy a movie.  I like a good story.  I prefer talking to action.  But none of this means anything if the characters are not likable.  Likewise, likable characters can make a bad movie passable.  In this case, Binoche's character keeps this movie from being downright horrible, instead bringing it up into the low end of mediocrity."

","I felt I must add a comment because it is simply beyond my comprehension why some people did not understand or like this film. This is one of the greatest stories about love and passion I have ever seen.One of my friends said that the beahvior of those two people was despicable. But,who are we to judge or despise them? Are any explanations given in Wuthering Heights for the case of mad passion Heatcliff and Catherine had for each other?(who were,BTW,played in one of the many on-screen adaptations of this exceptional novel,by the same outstanding actors Binoche & Fiennes).My friend also saw the count as a snobbish, cold, unlikable bastard. Those characters are not unlikable-the Count has never asked for anyone's sympathy or understanding.He had died long ago,along with his love, and is nothing but a human wreck,a shell containing broken bits & pieces of memories of a shattered life.And, the story is narrated by him, in many flash-backs & digressions, to match the structure of his memories.Everybody is concentrating only on the two parallel love stories inside the plot. But, they are just the means to deliver many themes,such as the question of nationality Vs. identity, love and its ability to overcome borders-the film is NOT about map-making! Count Almasy and Catherine are very complicated characters, and we are allowed to take but a glimpse inside of their intricate souls. I cannot help but feel attracted to them. His rather clear-minded,rational points of view of history, the world, life in general, are deeply shaken by the sudden passion for this intelligent, sensuous, married woman.You can see the change in him happening in front of your eyes-remember if you were surprised when he wanted to know the name of the base of a woman's neck in the middle of the fuss before having been forced to flight Cairo. Yes,they both may have done some despicable things,like lying, cheating etc. from an objective point of view. He has even helped the Germans by giving them the maps and thus broken his friend's heart.But, in his mind, where such abstractions like nationality & citizenship were not enough to define a person, a promise given to Catherine, that he would return to fetch her, has become his only purpose. Their love was so strong that has transcended time, place, every single of the many imposed boundaries of human civilization-like the sanctity of marriage, friendship, and transcended even death itself. And, then comes the greatest irony in this film:Almasy, a Hungarin count, a devoted servant of his majesty the Queen,an international bastard,captured in the desert by a British soldier, accused to be a German,helps the Germans by giving them the British maps, becomes, at the end, The English Patient-defined entirely by a nationality not his own. I could not help but feel sympathetic with this extraordinary character portrayed beautifully by Ralph Fiennes, even though I knew that the story was told completely from his point of view, and that he has let me see only a small portion of his rich inner world. I could go on for hours praising this film.All I wanted to say is that from its opening scene, with the lovely image of a brush painting something ,we cannot make out what at first, with that haunting melody of a beautiful androgynous voice lamenting a Hungarian lullaby in the background, to the breathtaking scenery, exceptional acting, outstanding directing-to the very end, is, to put it simply- PERFECT.

","This is a movie that divided audiences. A lot of people complained about how slow it was. (""Hurry up and die!"") The script is only 135 pages long, and much of that was left on the cutting room floor, yet the movie still runs for 150 minutes! <br/><br/>[ What's missing from the movie? Hana's fiancé makes several appearances in the script and it's sad when Hana learns he is dead. In the movie, she suddenly becomes depressed after somebody prattles on about ""Picton"", as if that meant something. Kip had a major story of his own, all cut from the movie. At one point in the movie he tells Hana he ""wants to be found."" That has a corollary in the script, but it was cut, leaving the line dangling. There's stuff about the sexuality of some of the other team members, almost all cut, but with a couple of tiny, unexplained moments left in the movie. ] <br/><br/>STORY <br/><br/>The scene is set by a reading from Herodotus (ancient Greek historian) of the story of Candaules, king of Lydia, and Gyges, a soldier. Candaules wants Gyges to be impressed by the beauty of his naked wife, so he sets up an opportunity for Gyges to spy on her when she undresses for bed. The nameless Queen learns of what happened and tells Gyges he must either submit to death for what he's done, or kill Candaules and take his place as King. Assassination follows, with the Queen and Gyges living together happily ever after. <br/><br/>When Geoffrey Clifton leaves his wife Katherine behind in the desert while he goes off adventuring, she comes close to dying in a sand storm. Almásy brings her through safely. Subsequently Katherine jumps into bed with Almásy, Geoffrey finds out and, consumed by jealousy tries to kill the three of them by crashing his plane into Almásy on the ground. He dies at once, Katherine dies some undefined time after, and Almásy much later.<br/><br/>TIME <br/><br/>The dates in the movie don't make much sense. They meet in the desert in 1938. Start the affair during that year and snatch a grubby bonk in a cupboard during the 1938 Xmas Party. The desert story ends after everyone goes home in May 1936, by command of the British Government. Almásy is supposed to be collected by Geoffrey in the plane and be taken out, except he tries to crash the plane into him instead. This must be May 1939. Almásy places the injured Katherine in a cave and heads off for help. He is arrested by the British Army, from whom he escapes, and is assisted by the German Army with fuel to fly another plane back to the cave. This suggests the military situation in North Africa of 1941 or 1942. The plane, with a perfectly preserved corpse in the front seat, is shot down by the Germans (date unknown). Almásy then appears as the Patient in an Allied Hospital train in 1944 in Italy. He lingers until after the European war ends in May 1945. <br/><br/>ROMANCE <br/><br/>This is, allegedly, a romantic movie. The ""romance"" consists of a married woman having an affair with a bloke she meets in the desert. The high point is the second time they're shown getting together, on her first wedding anniversary, while the cuckolded husband sits in a taxi outside the hotel waiting for her to reappear. He is aware of what is going on inside, but confines his response to sucking warm champagne out of a bottle. If that is ""romance"", I know I could live a long time without any, thank you so much. <br/><br/>BODICE RIPPER <br/><br/>At the high point of passion, Almásy rips Katherine's blouse open. He is rewarded with sight of a chest to match that of many adolescent males. As compensation, Kristin Scott Thomas provides a view of her pubic region as she decamps a bath. Sexy? No. This is followed by Almásy sewing the blouse together again, which is as close as the movie comes to unbridled excitement.<br/><br/>If you enjoy lingering views of desert sand, try LAWRENCE OF ARABIA."

","I am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense, such as that this film ""[proves] that when it is predestined, love will find a way.""  I begin in this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film, even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not ""prove"" anything, nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and ""The English Patient"" fails on both criteria.<br/><br/>I remember the studio's promotion of ""The English Patient"" very clearly: ""From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'"" it grandly announced.  An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word, ""producers,"" in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of ""The English Patient,"" so very inappropriately, with the truly great director, Milos Forman.  Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.<br/><br/>While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever.  Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar, the film bears little resemblance to the novel.<br/><br/>
Despite misgivings which began when I heard that shamelessly misleading promotion, I went to see this film in the theater.  As it began to unfold, I realized that the rendering of the novel's peculiar magic had failed, that the actors knew their words but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, dull, and unengaging.  The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje's novel and a completely still-born cinematic artifact of the worst description.<br/><br/>Those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like, ""sweeping,"" and ""grand,"" and ""hypnotic.""  Well, it is none of those.  In fact, not even Ondaatje's fine novel could be described as ""sweeping"" or ""grand.""  It could be described as ""magical"" and ""hypnotic"" -- yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver.  It is almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale, skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but that focused on the wrong characters.  He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them, as well.<br/><br/>Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the ""essence"" of it.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, driving, passionate love-affair to the viewer, but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable, perfunctory liaison between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers.  Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and overblown presentation.<br/><br/>The ""grand, sweeping, David-Lean-like"" qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean (""Dr. Zhivago"") is positively insulting to yet another great director.  Take, for example, the ""Patient's"" sandstorm scene, which is no doubt one wherein these ""grand, sweeping"" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grand -- it is not even convincing.  The subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm, which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, completely lacked either drama or emotion --in fact, because it was so patently weak, it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place.<br/><br/>This film failed.  It failed as a rendering of the novel, and it failed as a film.  It seems to have been the ""anointed Oscar vehicle"" of the year (joining such over-trumpeted filmic slosh as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" or ""Terms of Endearment"").  One can only thank God that even the hype-driven Acadamy<br/><br/>had the good sense to present the Best Actress award to Frances McDormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film, ""Fargo."" There was not a single performance in the execrable ""English Patient"" that was not either embarrassingly horrid over-acting (Willem Dafoe) or truly forgettable, mediocre acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas).<br/><br/>
Why this non-entity of a film retains a coven of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) devotees will remain a mystery.  Fortunately, the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently, and it will not, thankfully, have the strength ever to dig itself out."

","Winner of nine Oscars and a shelf full of other awards, The English Patient is an epic in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>                              Three years before making The Talented Mr Ripley, Anthony Minghella delivered a mesmerising drama of huge proportions for a mere $20million. It may lose a lot on the small screen but the script still packs something of a wallop and will leave many blubbing into their cushions. A great cast - Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe among them - provide more first class performances than you can shake a stick at and elegantly flesh out the tale of a hideously scarred central character, waiting for death. <br/><br/>                              The eclectic characters that come into contact with him are also nursing their own hurts and, thanks to an erratic narrative that flits between pre and post-World War Two, this tale unfolds so well, you may wish it would never end. <br/><br/>                              Fiennes delivers a measured performance as the eponymous, enigmatic character, Laszlo de Almasy; Scott Thomas is coolly elegant as his glacial lover, Katharine Clifton; while Juliette Binoche and Dafoe have rarely been better in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>
                              There are many memorable images, such as the opening painting of a stick figure superimposed over the shifting dunes of the desert, the Daffodil yellow biplane soaring over the mountains and Fiennes' scarred character carried through the rain at the end of the war. <br/><br/>                              An intelligent adult film which never takes itself as seriously as the David Lean movies of yesteryear.<br/><br/>
                              The scene where a character walks away during a movie screening is pure Brief Encounter - until they crack their head on scaffolding. It's touches such as this which make The English Patient all the more delicious a movie.<br/><br/>                              Although a bit of a bum-number, it definitely warrants the near-three hour running time.<br/><br/>                              It was a tough movie to get made given, as director Minghella says, that its star was burned beyond recognition in a bed, remembering things about Europe and the War, and it was to be directed by a film-maker who had never done anything on this scale before. But the cast was committed and, when the project appeared to have fallen through, never gave up. <br/><br/>                              Ralph Fiennes says: ""I did have complete faith that it would sort itself out. The script was so extraordinary and brilliant that I couldn't accept that it wouldn't be made at some point."" <br/><br/>                              Fiennes fell in love with the desert when they were filming in Tunisia. He found the hotel where they stayed, at an oasis in the south, dispiriting, but the desert itself was ""hypnotic, wonderful and very moving. It is sort of ironic that it becomes a set. It is bigger than a set and you come in and stake your claim and you are framing bits of a desert which is so enormous and infinite and an extraordinary place."" One of the problems with the production, aside from raising the budget, was shooting in the sand.<br/><br/>                              Every retake meant moving to a new location or resculpting the sand to make it look untouched by the size 10s of an international film crew. Minghella compared his problems to those of the late great David Lean whose epic, Lawrence of Arabia, this most resembles.<br/><br/>                              ""Lean would shoot and then go 40 kilometres to find an untouched spot,"" he remarked during production. ""It's no wonder he was found wandering in the desert.""<br/><br/>                              Minghella cut his teeth on Inspector Morse and it's rather nice to see none other than Kevin Whateley among the supporting cast.

","Well, to begin with, I liked the movie. It's rather long, and I had to switch it off and resume watching later, but I couldn't wait to resume. There are people saying how boring and stupid it is. It's true, to some extent: it lacks movement and tension, but before saying whether it's boring or not one should determine what genre it is. See, there are deserts but it's not Indiana Jones, there are planes, soldiers, nurses, but it's not a war movie. It's a romantic story, a love story, and everything: location, characters, time - fits this romantic pattern. We see exotic desert landscapes, Cairo, caves, sandstorms (on the one hand), and an Italian villa stuffed with mines (on the other), set before/during/right after WWII, - this would be an extraordinary situation. Now, characters. Explorers, a nurse, a sapper, a thief, German soldiers, spies... And the main hero is a Hungarian count, out in Africa making maps, moreover, a member of the Royal Geographical Society. Here are our extraordinary characters.<br/><br/>The point is that all this wouldn't drag a motion picture higher than 5 out of 10. It's then just a clear-cut example, nothing out of the ordinary. What makes this film very good (at least) is the acting. The performances are brilliant on the part of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. Besides, it's very beautifully shot. It's enjoyable, just like any romantic story should be. Although there's nothing really clever, or sophisticated, or globally important about it, but I wouldn't call it stupid.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's another curious thing about the movie. The love itself isn't shown here like anything sudden, unusual, something that breaks down settled, happy lives of the characters. It just happens, and that's all. To me it even seemed that those lives were broken even before the events described."

","I did give this film several shots. I just couldn't like it, but I really tried. The cinematography I enjoyed with all viewings, especially the scenes in which they flew over beautiful sand dunes. However, midway through the story it bogs down in this adulterous love affair between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. It picks ups slightly, but never really recovered. In both viewings, I wound up counting down the time left in the film. It's basically a woman's movie.<br/><br/>As a man, I enjoyed watching the beautiful Juliette Binoche, who plays a nurse who takes care of the burned Fiennes, whose scarred body, frankly, is interesting to view. Binoche has an affair with an Indian man and the highlight of that romance is when he hoists her aloft on a harness to see paintings high up on a church wall.<br/><br/>Fiennes, Thomas and Willem Dafoe all played unlikeable characters to me and didn't make the film worth giving it a third look. As I said, I tried.....and I was hardly alone. Of about a half-dozen friends I discussed this film with, I don't know one person who liked it. I was actually kinder towards it than most. Once again, we see an example of a modern-day movie that Academy Awards voted ""Picture Of the Year"" and most of the public disliked. The public, as usual, was a better judge."

He plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with Katherine Clifton,opens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affair.<br/><br/>The most heart-breaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt Katherine is carried by Almasy towards the Cave of Swimmers and she wears the thimble that he bought her.She says 'I always wore it.I always loved you' and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him.<br/><br/>Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the Oscar she won.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives."

Two hours and 42 minutes of hell. I made the mistake of seeing it in the theater. I kept the snack stand in business that night, as I was looking for excuses to take a break from the movie. One bag of Red Vines and a giant popcorn later, well, yes...the movie still sucked. You could hear the pretension in the theater when the beast ended: ""Wow! What a film.

","And my pity to all those out there who can't help but rave about this. It's quite clear that this film is either one you love or hate, but one point to make is that it does not depend on the person who watches it. Be it a child, an American, or someone from Europe, there's no such determination, which is as prejudiced as the people who commented earlier, as to ""why someone would or would not like it."" It really disgusts me when someone says you don't like a movie because you're ""American"" or that you ""did not understand it."" I understood this burnt piece of money dung of a movie really well; The thing I don't understand is why it is loved by so many people...<br/><br/>It seems whenever I ask someone why they liked this, I never get a reasonable answer. Just because this was a filmization from a (Michael Ondjante) romance novel does not neccesarily make it a good movie. A novel and a movie are two different things. I, personally, am not a fan of the ""lovers-broken-apart"" genre, but that is not why I loathed the tripe. I loathed this film simply because it was an overlong, over hyped, unsympathetic piece of grunge with no admiral protagonist. If it was based on a novel by Tom Wolfe, Clive Barker, or Anne Rice it would still make no difference to me whatsoever.<br/><br/>There was NO point to this crap. What was beautiful about it? The fact they filmed scenes of deserts? The fact it was about an amoral man who has an affair with his best friend's wife, get's burned up in a place crash and rambles to a nurse about what happened?  What most don't understand is just because a movie is about love and romance, does not make it good. Would you find this film beautiful if it was about two race sumpremacy people having an affair? There's a question you might want to answer. The whole idea of that plot nuance makes me grimace and puke.<br/><br/>There was no chemistry whatsoever, Ralph Fiennes looked about as wooden, stiff and emotionless as a horse in a pose of rigor mortis, Thomas looked as if she had consumed prozac when she was premenstrual. They were not beautiful, Fiennes was portrayed as an evil spy who sells out to the Nazis, and Thomas played a cold flaky woman committing adultery.<br/><br/>I was jealous of the people who sat next to me in the theater and got their money refunded just because they had known someone who worked in the theater. In that sense, yes. Otherwise, no. Well done, no.<br/><br/>The only other noticeable credit of the director (Anthony Minghella) was Truly Madly Deeply. I was scratching my head as to how and why such a big time magnate like Saul Zaentz would work with such a no-name. Unfortunately, I don't know why it is and how that happened. If I knew, I would be very rich.<br/><br/>When Zaentz entered the stage gloating at what the ignorance of the Academy did for him, I imagined that he would go home that night, snicker, and think how some people's stupidity could mean another person's benefit. If you did so many great films in the past, you're bound to be smart and feature a new project to the public without any complaints, right?<br/><br/>This movie has the relevance and value of a  watery bowel movement after it just came out of the toaster oven. It would have made no difference if the film was actually about that.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen it, avoid this movie at all costs. You'll be doing yourself a very big favor."

The central scenes in the abandoned church while the nurse takes care of the dying man are really fine. There is a wonderful stillness that is rare in western filmmaking. I'm sorry people are offended at the (obvious) immorality of some of the characters but I don't think anyone claims that these guys are heroic, only human. I guess I can relate better to humans than heroes.<br/><br/>If you didn't enjoy this movie last time, or haven't seen it yet then wait till it is on TV on a quiet afternoon or evening, put other things out of your mind, sit back and soak up this great movie. 10/10"

The first five minutes of this film are so hauntingly beautiful: the close-up of the painting of the black figure during the opening credits, the waves on the desert sand, and the plane being shot down and quickly catching on fire.  The person who made the comment about turning all the lights off and watching this film with someone you love is absolutely right.  I first saw this film when it was playing in theaters (1997).  I was able to see it again last week (I got the video) and I was as mesmerized by this film as I was when I first saw it.  It's a wonderful love story and visually, it's beyond stunning.

"TheLittleSongbird","9","9","15","12 April 2011"," Intensely moving and beautifully shot
","I personally have never understood the backlash The English Patient gets. I can understand why it might try someone's patience, as the pace is very slow and perhaps purposefully so and the film is very long at over two-and-a-half hours, but I do think it is unfair that there are those who consider one of the worst Best Picture winners(I personally think Crash, Cimarron, Braveheart and The Hurt Locker are worse, I have never understood the hate for Shakespeare in Love either as in my opinion that's better than the movie-Saving Private Ryan- that almost everyone says should have beat it). Fargo is a great film as well, whichever film won made no difference to me, as long as they are great movies which they are.<br/><br/>The English Patient may be a slow movie, with all the dates, character relationships and events unfolding at a purposefully leisurely pace, but it is also intensely moving, beautifully shot and compelling. The film looks stunning, the dessert scenes especially are reminiscent of the epic sweeping feel that Lawrence of Arabia had. The cinematography is incredibly beautiful, and the costumes and scenery are wonderfully lavish and evoke the period seamlessly. The English Patient has a truly haunting and heart-wrenching score, particularly in the end credits, complete with some fitting music choices. The film also has a poetic and thought-provoking script, a compelling story that conveys the characters' predicaments wonderfully complete with flashbacks that enhance rather than jar and superb direction by the late and very talented Anthony Minghella.<br/><br/>The English Patient has a strong emotional impact as well, the climatic sequence in particular moved me to tears that stayed long after the movie was over. The characters are richer and more complex than one might think, Almasy especially is very haunted and pained, and dealt with in an incredibly subtle way. The acting does perfect justice to these characters, Ralph Fiennes is absolutely brilliant in one of his best and more complex performances(I'd say only Schindler's List is better), and Kristen Scott Thomas shows a great chemistry with him, the scene where she is carried out of the cave by him is one of extreme pathos. Juliette Binoche is equally affecting, and Willem Dafoe and Kevin Whately are as strong as ever.<br/><br/>All in all, a moving and beautiful film, cinematically and emotionally. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Einsatzkommando-Monkey","1","21","42","12 January 2008"," Unbearable Saccharine Schlock
","Anthony Minghella's The English Patient (1996) shows us that Hollywood was capable beautiful pieces of art even before they started re-making classics circa 2000. Rather than refer to the director or the cast as separate entities, I would rather refer to them as a hideous amorphous blob known as ""krug103"", because as we all know, dehumanizing people is the best way to get them to shut up.<br/><br/>Based on (plot-wise) the mind-shattering post-modern poetic novel by Michael Ondaantje, the heart and soul of the author's work is raped and humiliated by the big screen until it cries for death. What we get, instead of a character study of deeply insightful, 10-dimensional characters, is a romanticized dick-fest of Ralph Fiennes and what's-her-face(whoever played The English Patient's love interest) hamming up the screen with their unimportant love story.<br/><br/>Some may consider it bad form to not even attempt to figure out the whore's name, but people who focus on the Patient and his affair, such as the director, are morons who completely missed the point of the novel. Another mistake the director made was turning Hana, Kip, and Caravaggio into 1-dimensional characters with absolutely no purpose in the movie but to listen to The Patient's story and make puppy-dog faces.<br/><br/>One would assume that after reading the poetic verses, and fully absorbing the bleak outlook of the novel, that the atmosphere would easily come to a creative director who would translate the dead atmosphere of the book to a visual journey into the psyches of those affected by the war, but instead we get a myopic excuse for a film that seems like the director had a creative writing class in high school taught by a complete idiot who photo-copies digest magazines in his spare time between marking perfects on assignments of people who he favours and watching lame sci-fi shows.<br/><br/>The utter carelessness and lack of attention towards the main themes of the novel, and the failure to present the deep characters and glorious atmosphere of the novel is so anger-inducing that i'm barely able to write a coherent review. It makes me reminisce about a creative writing teacher who would probably go to this movie and enjoy every moment of it because of its ability to adhere to the ""10 steps to directing a good movie"" crap that the establishment tries to feed people because they're too damn dumb to think beyond affairs, love and romance.<br/><br/>If I could rate this lower than a 1 I'd probably go into imaginary numbers or decimals.

","More than a decade after enduring this atrocity, I am still at a loss to determine what exactly compelled viewers (not to mention the Academy Awards) to lavish this uninspiring vapid mess with such over-the-top praise. There are so many things inherently wrong with the film that it becomes difficult to isolate which one of them is the most responsible for the film's implosion. Based on a popular novel - the reading of which would probably take less time than enduring the film - The English Patient centers on an mysterious count hideously disfigured by burns who victimizes his nurse (and the viewer) with the tale of ill-fated romance that left him physically and emotionally scarred. The film has its moments of beauty, but sweeping desert scenes are a dime a dozen in cinema and hardly earn this film's heralded descriptions of ""sweeping"" ""majestic"" and ""grand"". The film's two biggest problems are its length and its leads. The core story is relatively simple, but is so loaded up with pointless subplots and completely unnecessary extraneous characters that the film literally screeches to a halt shortly out of the starting gate. Willem Dafoe shows up late in the film to overact shamelessly and provide a narrative function that could just as easily have been satisfied by the nurse in a fraction of the time. Meanwhile, Colin Firth, whose character sets the film into motion as part of the central love triangle, is barely given a nod worth of screen time. Director Anthony Minghella seems to have no knowledge of the basics of pace, character development or how to emotionally involve his audience. A truly compelling romance requires that the central pairing crackle and draw the viewer into their emotions, whether the romance is illicit, young love or mature. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas are both singularly fine actors, but both share a similar acting style in that they are often restrained and emotionally aloof. The writing and dialog between them leaves the viewer unable to tell whether their characters are in love or merely in lust - but either way the actors generate zero chemistry between each other. Both come across as cold, selfish, uninteresting and emotionally inaccessible - leaving a glacial dead zone smack in the center of the film. To somewhat alleviate that, we get a romantic subplot between the nurse and a Sikh bomb expert that has a bit more emotion, but placing the emotional burden of the film on two supporting characters is highly unfair and completely ineffective. Juliette Binoche, as the nurse, acts pretty much like your standard super-model, leaving what little sympathy is generated to come from Naveen Andrews appealing work. By the time the film inexcusably limps towards its unforgivable third hour, most viewers will actually be rooting for the English Patient to do away with himself and regret that he had not done it a good 90 minutes earlier. Simply dreadful pretentious piffle."

","I, like seemingly most American males here, think this film is way overrated.  Yes, it had some great cinematography, which looked great on DVD.  But, for me, there wasn't one character (well, possibly Juliette Binoche) for whom I had even one lick of emotion.  I found there to be absolutely *no* chemistry between Fiennes & KST.  Fiennes sleepwalked throught virtually the entire thing.  Is 30 seconds of weeping supposed to make up for almost 3 hours of being utterly morose ? Also, the Defoe character was a complete red herring, placed in the movie simply to give Fiennes a reason to explain what happened.  Why was it necessary to show him getting is thumbs cut off ? Sure, I'm glad Juergen Prochnow got a paycheck, but he should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Yes, I think I ""get"" it.  The theme of losing things that one loves is pretty obvious, but for me, there are many other great, emotional dramas to see instead of this. Blue (w/ Binoche), Exotica, The Sweet Hereafter, From Here to Eternity, Double Life of Veronique all tower over TEP when it comes to emotional impact. Ugh."
"kira02bit","3","15","29","25 April 2006"," A romance as dry as the desert in which it is set
","First off, this movie is certainly one of the most beautifully shot that I have seen in a while. The desert vistas and gorgeous Italian scenery are beautiful to behold. Then again, there are far better films that provide these same elements.<br/><br/>Director Anthony Minghella puts together all of the elements which should have resulted in a haunting romantic spectacle, but someone forgot to strike the sparks required to set it ablaze. Nurse Juliette Binoche (whose bone structure contributes her performance) stays behind at a secluded abandoned monastery in the waning days of WW2 in order to care for enigmatic burn victim Ralph Fiennes, who slowly conveys his sad tale of illicit love, betrayal and tragedy which led to his current predicament.<br/><br/>There are a number of problems which plague the film. First, is its self-indulgent length. I have nothing against lengthy films or miniseries, so long as there is a suitable amount going on to require the length. Nearly every subordinate character is given some sort of clichÃ©d back story to enact in addition to the central romance - be it the nurse, her Sikh paramour who defuses bombs, or his friend. The film is already grossly overlong before Willem Dafoe (in a weak performance) shows up for no purpose whatsoever other than to introduce the concept that Fiennes may be a spy. The Dafoe character could have been easily excised and his function added to Binoche. Naturally, Dafoe's entire back story gets to be enacted in a series of tedious flashbacks. Ironically, no back story/flashbacks are reserved for Colin Firth, who is responsible for setting the climactic events into motion but previously is all but forgotten by the screenplay.<br/><br/>Where the film really fails is that it must be the most deadly romance in recent memory. Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas, as the married woman with whom he dallies, can be amazing actors singularly. However, they are both known for their cool, aloof reserved performances. You can certainly have a fine romance with two outgoing actors in the leads; you have a good shot with opposite-style actors (one vibrant, the other reserved), but casting two self-contained cool personalities at the center of a film that is trying to be a classy romance for the ages proves to be a disaster. They have all the appeal of being pelted in the face with cold wet sardines and even the inclusion of full-frontal nudity (courtesy of Scott-Thomas) fails to raise the heat level above a frozen tundra. Their total lack of chemistry is hardly helped by sporadically groan-inducing dialog like when Fiennes asserts lustily that ""I can still taste you."" This a not a romantic pairing to enlist your sympathy or set flight to your heart or imagination. The end result is a film that is a feast for the eyes, but starvation for the heart and soul."

","The most impressive aspect of The English Patient is its devotion to the emotions, turbulence and tragedy of the time, World War II. With the world turned upside down by a war and the end of Europe's royal class, viewers are taken on a visually stunning journey of love, betrayal, constant loss and the ever-so-slow passing of the central character, Count Laszlo de Almasy, brilliantly played by Ralph Fiennes. Many reviewers term this a ""reader's movie,"" and so it is. It's also a movie of the visual and musical arts, with scenes throughout the work stretching the bounds of fixed concepts. I often listen to the soundtrack by Gabriel Yared, with wide swaths of themes reveling in the adventures of archeologists in the Sahara and discoveries of Italian monastic art. Countering the classic themes are popular jazz and big band pieces from the 1930s and 40s, with de Almasy renowned for knowing the lyrics to every piece from the era. The characters throughout the story are classic, which weaves an enduring tableau of emotions, memories and the realization that as much as many view each era as different, there is always a sense of the retelling of stories, best stated with Casablanca's song, As Time Goes By. Lastly, there's a simple reason The English Patient earned nine Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Anthony Minghella: It's one of the best movies of all time. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

","The English Patient left me feeling complete, with no unanswered questions, or lingering emotions. This can be a good and bad thing, but with the nature of such a narrative (the flashbacks that make up the bulk of the picture) it is essentially an investigation, so indeed a visceral, but neat conclusion is fitting. <br/><br/>The film is beautifully acted by an as always masterful Ralph Fiennes, the astonishingly transient Juliette Binoche, and the surprisingly great Kristen Scott Thomas. On top of these three are a plethora of reasonably memorable support characters, including Willem Dafoe, among others less worthy of comment. <br/><br/>I found it to appear shot well enough, although there were some strange decisions with regards to camera-work that often puzzled, however. The haunting aesthetic of the Egyptian desert is an especially dominant presence, and I admired the way in which the filmmakers did not resort to constant 'sweeping establishing shots' to wow the audience. However, most of the scenes are simply constructed, and I do wish some more artistic decisions were made.<br/><br/>Critically, there were moments where the film left me frustrated. For example, Dafoe's sudden emergence as Carvaggio was bordering on absurd, and certainly towards the end of the piece, the present day sequences seemed almost cartoonish: a whole host of reliably diverse and colourful characters living in the ruins of an old mansion, sometimes making love, always ignoring the supposedly urgent matter of World War Two cascading around them.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, the relationship between Fiennes' character and Thomas' was thrilling, and the drama surrounding it was gripping to the same extent. This is pretty much the solid, believable core of an overall great romance/drama/war picture. The minutes just fly by."
"mssandlin","2","11","20","9 March 2001"," One of the most overrated romance movies of all time
","TEP is basically a passionate love story full of interesting and realistic characters which is never told.  The acting is good.  No one can deny that, but all the good acting in the world couldn't save this movie. There are essentially four stories going on at any time during the movie: the flashbacks of a dying man, his relationship with the woman who is caring for him, a nurse's attempt to love someone without them dying, and a man with no thumbs looking to get revenge for what happened to him.  There is just too much going on in this movie.  None of the stories are ever resolved very well.  It is almost as if the director was just getting into the movie when he realized that it was already over three hours long and tried to wrap everything up very quickly.  The only real romance in the film comes in the form of flashbacks to an almost comical affair between Ralf Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas.  The first love scene, which is supposed to be one of those angry/passionate sex scenes, ends up looking like a botched up rape. The nudity is almost tacky and lacks any artistic value.  Even the shots of the desert, which were really nice at first, got old after the first two and a half hours.  I rated it a two. Very Unimpressive."

Don´t misunderstand me, folks, I´ve got nothing against pure entertainment, sometimes I want to turn off my brain, too. To all those people who didn´t like this film: I suppose you had your problems with all those flashbacks, isn´t it? This a love story you should turn on your head to let the emotions work. It´s about how the war destroyed the love between the  people. Not to mention I really loved Gabriel Yared´s beautiful and epic score, John´s Seale´s great work as cameraman and of course all the actors, from Ralph Fiennes to Willem Dafoe.

"MrsRainbow","7","9","16","24 January 1999"," A rebuttal for the nay side
","OK. First I must make a couple of points clear. I am in America, I am male. I am, however, also a big fan of Ralph Fiennes. I even know that it's pronounced Rafe. And despite being an American male, my tastes do not run to the I am a caricature of the ultimate male so overwhelming with testosterone that I must blow up things every five minutes and then have passionate sex with multiple women type of movie. I like dramas, I like foreign films. I also read reams of literature. My favorite movies are probably Solyaris and Lawrence of Arabia, a film which many people have compared TEP to.<br/><br/>But I had problems with TEP. First off, comparing this to David Lean I believe to be absurd. Why? Because it has shots of the desert? There are no other possible comparisons in my view. Lawrence of Arabia was about a truly complex and interesting man, however glamorized he might be at times.<br/><br/>But TEP had no characters worth caring for. It reminds me of a book by Don Delillo called Underworld. It's been hailed as a great American novel, but when I read it, the writing and obvious ability to use language were impressive at times, but I was not drawn into the book at all. The characters were self-centered and one-dimensional. I wouldn't care if the New York art house types in the book died and were boiled in their oil paints.<br/><br/>I felt the same way about TEP. The characters were despicable. The tired immoralist in love with his ennui. Oh wow, I think I'll cry. I felt the film was pretentious and overbearing, another diseased child in the inbred line of film royalty, which was hailed as a masterpiece because the producers set out to make one and the critics told us that it was. As in Underworld, the ability to use the form well was evident, but form does not make a great film or novel.<br/><br/>So, needless to say, I was rooting for deaths all round when TEP approached its end, as I felt that I might then have gotten some value for my money. Though this will make some people scream at me, I must lump TEP in with the group of Titanic, Braveheart, Elizabeth, and all such pseudo-epics which attempt to overwhelm you with their passion, but really turn out to be banal and pompous, too aware of their own striving for grandeur."

The movie made little to no sense, drug on for what seemed like forever, and had characters whose subtle and cloyingly distant personalities engendered in me only the fervid hope that they would all suffer horrible deaths by the movie's end. If only I'd known that my wife, who'd suggested the movie and was sitting next to me in the theater, was praying for a natural disaster to cut the movie short, I could have avoided all the pain and just left before the pain became too intense to bear.

","The extramarital affair of two rich pompous and pretentious people who indulge in their own delights whilst others fulfil their duty to the war on the frontline, is the centre to this story. They are an utterly boring pair, especially the English patient himself, who proudly proclaims ""I do not bargain (with the local market merchants)"" in a disdainful tone. They are a construct always speaking as if they are reciting pretentious poetry. The historical chronicles of Herodotus are referred to by the pair repeatedly as if to remind the viewer that these people are oh so learned. When playing spin the bottle with others singing funny songs and having fun around a campfire, the female protagonist (the only woman in the company of about 5 men) recites a boring story of Gyges lusting for Candaules and her nakedness. That's when we first glimpse her narcissism and flirtatious personality.<br/><br/>The most preposterous part is when our poetic lovers are stranded in the desert due to a plane crash involving the grieving husband. As she is injured, and her husband lies dead, her besotted lover leaves her alone with a flashlight and her precious Herodotus in a cave in the middle of the desert and walks to get help. Yes, that's right. With an ankle fracture her fate is sealed when he leaves her alone, whilst he embarks on a 3 day journey through the desert to return with a car. He is unsuccessful (there is a war after all). After a substantial period of time, he returns to the cave. Her body would be either desiccated or bloated, yet she is shown as fresh as the moment he left her when he lifts her in his arms and puts her in a plane again. Taking off, he crashes again in the desert and is burned to near death, but taken by passing Arabs to a hospital (through the desert again). A nurse, abandons her duties to wounded soldiers to feed and administer morphine repeatedly to this one selfish man for a substantial period of time, and she is portrayed as an angel.<br/><br/>This movie sentimentalises and romanticises war. The love story is puerile and gross. I think lovers of cinematography might like it."

","I have had this film on my radar since it won the Oscar lo these many years. It is described as romantic drama and the sound of it turned me off. Now that I've seen it, I know why it was so highly thought of. Those who criticize it seem to have two axes to grind. It's too long and the characters are unlikeable. I never thought for a moment that the film was too long; I didn't even notice the length. As for the characters, they are what they are, incredibly complex. Throw people into the mess of war and they don't behave ""properly."" This is a movie about undying love and the reality of conflict. We continue to fight wars despite the toll they produce. Human beings aren't satisfied with being the chosen species, they have to go about taking that from others. I know this sounds simplistic. Of course, wars need to be fought, but the price is great. Yes the main characters are selfish and passionate and don't look back very well. People to cheat and divorce and act on baser instincts, but the movie lets us know why their motives are. Sometimes I think that people would like a cotton candy presentation of life. Well, that's not art. Art gets at the guts of what we are and presents it to us, even if we don't like it. I thought Fiennes character was at times a total ass. He took and didn't give back. He catalogued his life inside a copy of Herodotus, creating a scrapbook of his existence. There are also our peripheral characters. Kip and Hana who are also victims of war, and the Dafoe character who hasn't lost as much but is marked for life. Everyone grows, even in the faith of death, and the spirit lives on. This is one marvelous film."

I find I can respectfully disagree with someone about any film but this.  Some unreasonable part of me rejects as an idiot anyone who doesn't like this movie (painful when it involves family members, but there you are); obviously I'm not alone in this, as the Seinfeld episode makes clear: it is the kind of thing you break up with someone over (luckily my husband loved it, too). OK, this is a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.  It is the sheer artistic cohesiveness and depth of it. Every element is amazing: the screenplay (of a nearly impossible-to-follow novel), the directing, the acting, the cinematography, the score . . . nothing is as it seems, which is just the point. I never watch it without seeing some new detail which both echoes and elaborates on one of the many themes and images which are so intricately wound throughout.  It is that rarest of film achievement: a work of art.  I judge every subsequent film by how it compares to the overall achievement of The English Patient; no winners so far.  The critic for The New Yorker at the time of the film's release(not sure if it was David Denby or Anthony Lane) summed up my feeling exactly: a masterpiece."

The overall story is too thin to be worth the agonising slowness of the development. <br/><br/>This film could perhaps have made some impact as a slightly diverting short story. <br/><br/>I think the warning to the viewer comes in the occupation of the main character. He is a map maker mapping the Sahara Desert. This cannot be the most exciting of tasks for the main character to undertake. However it does rather set the scene for the remainder of the film. <br/><br/>No doubt there will be posts after this one singing the praises of the film and expressing how wrong those who disagree are.

Even though a vast majority of the film is in flashback mode as he lies in a bed dying, he will completely steal your heart once again as you see this movie unfold. I will not try to tackle the historical background of this film because that is just not me. This review is based on my feelings alone. Every time I see Fiennes in this film, I cry. He is just beautiful. He reluctantly begins a love affair with a gorgeous married woman in the desert. They soon become very involved with each other, hiding their affair from her husband (Colin Firth). The love scenes between the two in this film are so passionate and overwhelming that one must hold one's breath and watch several times to take the emotional ecstasy in. I also cry during the parts of the film when his nurse is taking care of him and ultimately over medicates him so he can die in peace. She is beautiful too. I believe she has great love for him and also for what he has lost. She is in love with the mystery of the man dying on his sick bed. The scene where Fiennes carries his lover out of the cave after she has passed is just devastating. He goes through a personal hell to try and save her only to find that she has expired after his return. This film is riveting during every second. I'm glad I didn't see this in a theater.

The desert hasn't looked so enchanting since 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Also, the costumes, sets and locations are all superb. If anything, it's a fantastic film to look at. The score is also amazing and never fails to move me to tears at certain moments (especially the climactic sequence). The script is brilliant as well. The film balances the multiple story lines and time periods perfectly, and never becomes confusing or crowded.<br/><br/>In addition to the visual/technical aspects, the acting is nearly perfect. Every actor gives a subtle performance filled with depth and history. The viewer can really feel their emotions, whether it be passionate lust or painful anguish. I couldn't really choose a favorite character as I ended up engrossed in all their lives equally enthralled.<br/><br/>It's a sweeping epic in the vein of old Hollywood (similar to Titanic's style), but ""The English Patient"" is much more mature and heartbreaking, in my opinion, with a certain kind of cinematic poetry that we don't see enough of. It's the kind of film where you feel like you're reading someone else's journal or diary, except, of course, on a much grander scale. I'd highly recommend reading the novel by Michael Ondaatje, as well. In fact, it's more comparable to reading a classic romance novel, with all their history and vivid descriptions. I once read someone call this film ""a reader's movie,"" and I agree. It's pacing is slow, but rewarding, and you find yourself so wrapped up in it by the end that you can't look away."

"secondtake","8","5","8","11 February 2010"," A highly romantic, layered, dramatic, beautiful experience...sometimes in excess?
","The English Patient (1996)<br/><br/>This pulls out every high drama romance issue known to men and women in love, and with great sophistication and beauty. It is set in that most dramatic of times, World War II, and in the most gorgeous of places, North Africa dripping in sand and sun, and Italy in the provinces outside of Florence. The leads are sophisticated and beautiful, too, so if you don't fall in love with the scenery, and don't get sucked in by the layered and heart wrenching plot, you'll come to love at least some of the characters, played by actors of substance, with intensity.<br/><br/>So what could go wrong? Some will say nothing. It did win seven (seven!) Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director (for the richly talented Anthony Minghella). Yet both times I saw it I was not quite absorbed. I don't think it is too long, especially, though it is long. Instead I think it is too perfect, which of course is double talk, to say that the flaw of a movie is that it is too perfect. But you can see, maybe, how a movie is just so poised and fluid and cinematically calculated it starts to feel ""knowing"" or somehow aware of its own perfection. Likewise with the plot, screenwritten by Minghella from a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is almost too packed with the worst and best kinds of scenes--abandoned lovers, lovers seeing lovers cheat on them, identities lost, memories told by candlelight, promises made and kept, or not kept, against the most grandiose odds and explosive circumstances. It's amazing stuff, and it begs for honesty, for some cracks in the glass. <br/><br/>Too much Tiffany and blood, not enough hesitation and error. Those things make for a different kind of perfection.<br/><br/>But then again, this is like finding the flaws in a Hitchcock film. They abound, and they might be interesting, but don't forget the whole, the parts that work, and work you over, and leave you breathless and crying if you let them. The English Patient rises above itself many times. Juliette Binoche is easily the most compelling character in her honesty, and Colin Firth gives a small but charmed performance. Ralph Fiennes is meant to have two different sides to his character (or three, if you include the bed-ridden version), and when he is sparkling and feisty he is alive on the screen. As a brooding, serious man he approaches wooden at times, though some women might disagree. The least known of the four or five main actors, Kristen Scott Thomas, is meant to be exactly what she is--an adventurous and gifted person who everyone likes but who is, at heart, making the most of being away from England, and this unromanticized presence is key. Finally there is Willem Dafoe, who plays that slightly exaggerated, quirky, creepy guy he can do so well.<br/><br/>And this of course, just brushes against the iceberg. Like The Talented Mr. Ripley (by the same director), this is a mammoth undertaking, hugely engrossing, but unlike Ripley, this one is at times ironically cold, playing with so many flashbacks its construction starts to intrude. But the movie is still worth seeing for what it pulls off best: high romance, great drama, and another version of true love on the screen."

Anyone who has a problem with it's length almost certainly has not read the book, and probably cannot read.

"shanfloyd","9","5","8","6 September 2005"," A thought-provoking story... rich in performances.
","The director Anthony Minghella must have had some immense passion for the original story, otherwise I believe he could not let this film grow such slowly emphasizing on every relevant detail. To wrap up the premise, it is definitely a love story, but it is much much more. The film features two stories of love... one is Count Almasy's passionate affair with his colleague's wife Katharine, shown in flashback; and the other, set in the story's present, is between Kip the Sikh bomb disposal expert and Hana the French-Canadian nurse who took care of Almasy after a deadly injury in WWII. While the central story revolves around Almasy's painful memories, it also contrasts his and Hana's experiences with love with a haunting style.<br/><br/>The character of Almasy gives a golden chance to any actor. His plane got shot down in the Sahara and he was taken to Italy severely burnt, injured, and crippled, with an acute memory loss. He was put to an abandoned house with Hana to take care of him. As Hana read some part from the book he possessed, his memories kept coming back to him... memories of a passionate yet futile relationship. And yet he was surely going to die, his only motivation to live was to get the memory of the that love's fate back. Ralph Fiennes gives perhaps his career-best performance as Almasy. He portrays Almasy as a glum yet romantic man who himself never thought his capability to love someone could be so deep. His take on the burnt-faced, crippled Almasy is equally fascinating. He certainly deserved his Academy nomination.<br/><br/>Hana is an extremely good natured woman, yet her own experiences with love had been also painful until she meets the Army bomb expert Kip Singh (played excellently by Naveen Andrews). She gets fascinated by his original romanticism and subsequently worries if he will also face the same fate as her previous lovers. Her relationship to Almasy is nothing extraordinary as such, but there remained a bond between them, formed by their choices and nature of love. Juliette Binoché won Oscar for this role and that sums up how she acted. She portrays Hana as one who's optimistic in the outside but bears a strange frustration and pain about love deep inside. Two contrasting scenes: one, when she plays at the yard in the evening and two, when she rides the bicycle up to the bridge to see if Kip's alright.<br/><br/>All the other actors were also great. Willem Dafoe gives a very realistic performance as the Canadian war victim with a hidden agenda. Kristin Scott Thomas perhaps, in my opinion, was not the best choice for the role of Katharine but what she did was magical. Colin Firth was also nice to watch as her husband.<br/><br/>As a director Minghella is definitely breathtaking. Instead of discussing his style, I would only mention some scenes from the movie which remained unforgettable. One, the sandstorm; two, the scene where Almasy first courts Katharine; three, the first verbal exchange between Almasy and Caravaggio; four, where Kip shows Hana the paintings at the church... I see I can go on and on. Minghella also brings out a magnificent screenplay with some memorable quotes.<br/><br/>The English Patient is a movie rich with every ingredient a serious film should have -- cinematography, original music, make-up, good script and of course, acting. Although it may seem a bit slow it is not boring, rather this slowness is one of its gifts."

","Sorry. Katharine and Almásy are two very self-absorbed people, their encounters are anything but romantic, and there is no compelling reason for them to seek each other out: Almásy is a surly jerk, and Clifton worships the ground Katharine walks on. She initially breaks with Almásy not because she loves her husband (notice how quickly she recovers after realizing she is a widow), but fears what will happen to her social standing.<br/><br/>As if being asked to root for these twits wasn't bad enough:<br/><br/>1) How did Almásy know that Katharine told Clifton she wanted to return to England?<br/><br/>2) Trying to get Madox to turn around, Almásy shoots the flare behind him. Despite Almásy's assurances to Katharine, it's a mystery how Madox manages to find them.<br/><br/>3) Caravaggio asks Almásy if he killed the Cliftons. But since he was told of the circumstances of Madox's death, he must have been briefed on them, too.<br/><br/>4) Assuming they found Clifton's plane, how did British Intelligence locate his body after Almásy buried it?<br/><br/>5) How could the Nomads find the thimble, but not Katharine?<br/><br/>6) Katharine and Almásy had hooked up by December 1938. Germany invaded Egypt in February 1941, but was driven out by November 1943. Almásy gives the Nazis the maps so he can get back to Katharine, gets shot down, then pops up in Italy in 1945?! Forget that we're supposed to buy that nobody suspected they were doing the nasty for over two years! Either Katharine was in the cave for two years (not likely), Almásy was cared for by the Nomads for two more years (even less likely), or Minghella screwed up the time line big time (a lot more likely.)<br/><br/>But what really drove me nuts was: <br/><br/>7) The British couldn't possibly have mistaken ""Almásy"" as German because Hungarian and German do not have a common ancestor. Ironically, English is a Germanic language.<br/><br/>I read that when Saul Zaentz bought the rights, he ""assured"" Michael Ondaatje: ""Don't worry, we'll f***-up your book.""

This is photography to marvel at, to revel in.  The desert is brought to life, in rich, vivid textures, in marvellous detail and astounding beauty.  Music to make your heart soar, to bring tears to your eyes.  The story is fantastic (though you have to read the book to appreciate all the nuances, particularly those around Hana, Kip and Caravaggio), an epic romantic tragedy that rivals (and indeed surpasses) the melodramas of yesteryear.  The actors are perfectly casted, utterly compelling and beliveable.  And with a script like that who could ask for more - 'what do you love, say everything.'  My favourite film, without a doubt."

Although some of the plot details and characters have been cut, it still does not detract from the overall greatness of the film. The English Patient fell, and falls, victim to the criticism of those who believe that it is either too sappy', too long' or all those Oscars mean it is just Hollywood trash being hawked to the public'. Well, it may be sappy, but it is beautiful also. And for those who argue it is too long (260mins) may just need to stop complaining. A film of this magnitude needs that amount of time to tell its story and to tell it well. And do it well it does!

Add to this the mandatory evil Nazis, some unnecessary action sequences, and a little bit of explicit violence - and you have your average, cliche World War II romance-adventure movie.<br/><br/>While flashbacks can be an effective device in telling a story, this movie simply overdoes it.

The mesmerizing soundtrack and the beautiful and evocative images bring an atmosphere so sugestive that you will fall in love in a moment. Let's be honest: what do we look for when we go to a theater to see a movie? One good story, the one we should have live, and some images to be remembered at the end of the day... or for a lifetime. I am by no means romantic, at least I dont go to cinema ""looking for a movie to cry with"", but believe me, the English Patient turns you into a state of sensibility that makes you realize the beauty of feelings, not only the happy ones, but the sad ones too. I mean, true great stories are the ones that contain a mix of feelings and facts (adventure, romanticism, sadness, action) that makes you breathe deeply and say that's life, and that's beautiful."

","This was Miramax's first great success and I think it can be argued that the film industry would be very different had this film not won Best Picture. There is a pretty straight line from it to Jackson's Lord of the Rings which had a massive influence. In any case it is wonderful film in its own right that is in some ways as ambitious as the aforementioned Jackson films. It too grapples with a largely unfilmable book that is dense, multifaceted and layered. And pulls it off with uncommon grace and skill.<br/><br/>The film, at its heart, is a mediation on loyalty and what it means to make a promise. (And to what you should tie your scared honor). Every one of the wonderful vivid characters is confronted with violating an oath and legal custom. Each is faced with a personal dilemma that connects to WW2 in some way. The way each fails or succeeds at this task provides poignancy to the story and the film is filled with a bittersweet energy that is heartbreaking. Almasy, especially, is a wonderful character caught in the snares of competing loyalties. That he ultimately fails his promise due to his name/national origin solidifies the film's anti-nationalism edge.<br/><br/>Apart from the utterly engrossing story, the film is marvel for its budget. I can't believe such a beautiful film was only made for 27 million dollars. It competes with the likes of Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur for the sheer spectacle of the film. The cinematography is wonderfully sensuous and moody. The film is quite slow moving (to the film's strength) but you get lost in the images because of Minghella's eye. The church scene with Hana-Kip especially is the height of romance.<br/><br/>This is what an epic should be."

Also let me say I'm not some art student, fan of art-house films or anything other than a normal movie goer so I don't really understand people using big words to review a film.<br/><br/>However I am happy to say that this is the best film of all time. I've watched a lot of films to the point where I've almost run out, I've worked my way through other peoples lists of 'best films of all time ever' and gave them a fair chance. But this film is fantastic! The reason why I like it is very soft I'm afraid, it's such a raw depiction of how real relationships happen. You become completely immersed in the unspoken desires of the core characters, you *will* the relationship to unfold and if something goes wrong you're screaming ""NNNNOAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHH"". You can imagine times that the same thing has happened to you but your life did/did not pan out like that.<br/><br/>Ralph Feinnes does what he does best, plays a reserved Englishman masking incredibly intense emotions as best he can.

"DesbUK","8","4","6","1 April 2008"," Anthony Minghella's most famous film is worth re-watching
","The unexpected death of the English film director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella in March 2008 prompted me to re-watch his greatest triumph on DVD again. It's a curious film which has as many detractors as admirers. 'The English Patient' was released in 1996 and won nine Oscars (including Best Director for Minghella) and six British Academy Awards (including Best Adapted Screenplay for Minghella).<br/><br/>Filmed on location in Italy and Tunisia, with a mostly British cast (Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, Colin Firth, Naveen Andrews, Julian Wadham, Kevin Whatley) plus the French Juliette Binoche and the American William Dafoe - 'The English Patient' confirms Minghella as the most literary and romantic of English filmmakers - his movies are considerably distanced from any kind of reality. Often compared to David Lean, this film mixes elements of 'Brief Encounter' (adultery accompanied by classical piano concertos) and 'Lawrence of Arabia' (a passion for the desert). John Seale's camera and Stuart Craig's quite remarkable production design conjure up two remote and distant worlds. The first is the North African deserts in 1938/39, where Count Almasy (Fiennes) and the English couple Geoffrey and Katherine Clifton (Firth and Thomas) are members of the International Sand Club, a group of explorers mapping the desert. Almasy begins an ill-fated affair with Clifton's wife.<br/><br/>In 1945, Almasy is the anonymous 'English patient', bed-ridden and disfigured by an air crash. He spends his days in an abandoned Italian monastery being cared for by a French Canadian nurse called Hana (Binoche). Also there is a morphine addicted allied spy called Carravagio (Dafoe) and two British Army bomb disposal men (Andrews and Whatley). The monastery gives a sense of an awkward end of World-War 2 meeting point of various races and nationalities: Eastern European, Canadian, Sikh and British.<br/><br/>But this description affords Minghella's screenplay a linear clarity which isn't there. We constantly cut between the North African and Cairo of 1938/39 and the Italy of 1945. The late 30s become a place of Almasy's memories, where he retreats to in his final frail dying days. The opening and closing shots of the film are both the same - Almasy's final flight in a bi-plane containing Katherine's body. Geoffrey - grief stricken by the knowledge of his wife's betrayal - tried to kill the three of them by crashing his bi-plane. Almasy had to leave the injured Katherine a desert cave whilst he walked across the desert for help. Eventually, all he can do is give the German army the maps of the desert in exchange for a bi-plane to go and rescue Katherine. She is, of course, long dead.<br/><br/>Best of all, Minghella brings consistently good performances from the entire cast. Twentieth Century Fox didn't want Kristin Scott Thomas for the Katherine role in The English Patient - they wanted Demi Moore. And without her, Fox withdrew from the film (it was eventually financed by Miramax). Minghella's loyalty to Scott Thomas was not only rewarded by her Oscar and BAFTA nominations, but by the fact it's impossible to imagine very many actresses conveying Katherine's luminous beauty and intelligence in the same way - it makes us understand why her husband Geoffrey (Colin Firth) would kill himself on becoming so engulfed with grief and jealousy on discovering her affair with Almasy. Is she England's most beautiful actress? There's an astonishing scene when we see her full frontal nude getting out of a bath - a thirty-something blonde just oozing sex and charm. It's hard not to feel saddened when she dies alone in the desert cave.<br/><br/>'The English Patient' is a complex novel and Minghella's adaptation of the book is a version of it. Give the same book to, say, Ronald Harwood or Christopher Hampton, and a very different adaptation might emerge. It's hard not to still admire Minghella's screen craft as a director, even when you're bored and confused by the leaps in time. He includes a gripping set-piece of Kip attempting to defuse a bomb beneath a bridge which threatens to be detonated by rumble of on-coming Allied tanks. He handles the period atmosphere quite magnificently, the atmosphere of worn and war-torn oldness in 1945, of stillness, space and heat in the monastery and desert, something which gives these characters a chance to speak, to be heard, to emote in their own space - all without distraction. The atmosphere so engulfs you that upon emerging from the viewing you feel you're emerging back into reality."

I was just expecting a decent story about how innocence is stolen by warfare and evil, and how two people are separated from such. I interpreted the opposite. The film was about two bad people, and how one big bad thing keeps them away from something they want. In film, you could cheer for the villains  when they're the protagonist, but when they're not interesting, it's quite difficult. On top of that, it was just an all around boring movie.

","I cannot believe this movie won best picture.  Yes, it has nice cinematography and the acting is good, but it was far too long (for what the telling of the story accomplished) and very, very boring.  I thought the story focused too much on the relationship between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas- a relationship I found myself not caring about at all, partly because Kristin Scott Thomas' character was not very likable- and not enough time on the relationship between Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews- characters I did like and was interested in.  Someone told me that in the novel, this relationship is stressed more than it is in the movie.  I don't know why, then, it was not really shown in the movie- if this was a matter of keeping the time down or if it was because they were unsure how the public would react to a multi-racial relationship, because for some reason there are still a lot of people out there that have problems with interracial relationships.  I really hope this wasn't the reason, because that would mean that not only did this movie suck, the creators also lacked integrity.  Anyway, like I said, the movie was too long, yet it seemed to do nothing with this time.  There were far too many shots where we apparently were supposed to gush at the scenery, time which could have been spent on, say, the relationship between Binoche and Andrews, or one making Kristin Scott Thomas' character seem less shallow.<br/><br/>I cannot understand how this movie got nominated for best picture, never mind how it won.  I don't remember every movie that came out in 1996, but the other nominated pictures were better by far, even if they were not amazing films themselves.  Jerry Maguire was not a spectacular film, but it was certainly better than The English Patient.  Hey, even Independence Day and The Rock were more deserving of Oscars, because they at least were not boring. Twister had nifty special effects, such that even with its nonexistent storyline, it was more entertaining. There are very few movies I have seen that are as boring as The English Patient.  The only reason I didn't leave is because I paid to see it, that and I kept expecting it to get better, because of its accolades.  Instead I wound up very disappointed. This movie reminded me of reading a textbook- tedious and hard to pay attention to, with only odd bits of interest.  If you're the kind of person who enjoys reading textbooks in your spare time, this movie is for you. If not, pass this one over for better works by these talented actors, such as Schindler's List, Quiz Show, or Four Weddings and a Funeral."

There are certain movies that makes you feel alive because you FEEL something: sometimes we forget what we are looking for, when we watch a film- we are looking for certain feelings to be created, for certain emotions to surface again. This film is all about this and more. Indeed is a slow paced movie, indeed the characters are not so great, but even the real life is not perfect, so let's put aside all this, and enjoy it with an open minded. Romance is something that appeals a lot to filmmakers, but again, few of them manage to capture it so nice on the screen. The actors were just amazing, the score is captivating and the cinematography reminds of Antonioni.

Lust equals love and it is the supreme value, even if it means other people get maimed and killed and tortured, not to mention just emotionally worked over. I mean, yeah it's nice that our anti-hero's lady-love didn't have to get a boob job to be considered desirable, but she was so morally repulsive that it ended up being a back-handed complement to the small-breasted women of the world.

They were loyal only to their own desires-Katherine heeding not her marriage vows (even though she is plagued with guilt)and the Count committing fornication and showing his obsession with 'K' at the dance party where it looks like he was seriously going to do some physical harm and threatened her for being with others. They both should have been buried in the sandstorm before their passions got out of control. Why glorify animal lust and call it love when they were only together for a short expedition. The adventures in the desert were much more interesting such as the Swimmer's Cave. Why was the druggie thrown into the mix as well? Is he the villain to fear the whole film? There was some interesting World War history with the mines and torture room but other than that I wish the Count's book was burned and I did not waste my time on this film. I'm sure Hana the nurse had a more interesting past instead of a map making guy who was burned all over. Hana commits murder at the end and then smiles at a little girl in the truck.

","Gorgeous cinematography and two beautiful actresses certainly give a movie a good start, but that's really all this movie has. Moreover, the lead actor, in what amounts to 2 roles (before and after the accident), plays an unattractive character, cold and monochromatic. In a somewhat pivotal scene, Laszlo stares at Katharine while he is dancing with her like an inexperienced young man who has read a book on how to dominate girls. Indeed, why Katharine would even look at Laszlo when she is married to the manifestly nicer and better looking Geoffrey, is the movie's biggest mystery. For the rest, although the movie is supposedly about World War II, there is almost no mention of politics, no mention at all of religion, nobody seems to have any place they have to be (in wartime, soldiers don't get to just hang around where they please), and the morals are suited to a rabbit hutch. Oh, and the Germans are brutal (how can you have a movie take place in the 1940s without a nice German torture scene?), the British are vulgar, and the Americans just plain stupid (the scene on the bridge). That this movie won 9 academy awards can only testify to the poverty of today's film industry."

Anyway, what defines me in the first place is not gender and continent but the fact that I've seen many films in my life - and I don't mean Hollywood fast food but European and alternative production, the so-called art film. Thus I can claim that what TEP intended (and failed), Lars Von Trier fully developed in Breaking the Waves.

","... I swear I must be.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where they show you then end at the beginning of the movie then (in this case) spend over 3 hours showing you how the characters got there. That tactic only works when the end teases you (this one doesn't), and the movie isn't so long that you are praying for people to die so the film will finally stop. I swear I just didn't care about any character by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Other comments: Willem Defoe's (a great actor in my opinion) character was odd, out of place, and never fully explained. My thought is that initially his role was much more prominent and when the first cut went 5 hours, they decided to trim his screen time. The result? His character adds nothing, causes too many questions and frustrates people like me who get irritated when characters swoop in and out of a film irrationally.<br/><br/>Re: costuming... Lovely and totally unrealistic. I got really tired of seeing people in perfectly-pressed Banana Republic linen after spending days in sand storms (don't even get me started on the perfect make up and hair).<br/><br/>Finally, plot basis: Is anyone else bothered by the fact that most current romantic movies are based on adultery? This one is no different. Now I am no prude, but I was having a REAL problem wishing for Finnes and Scott Thomas to get it on, because she is married. I don't care if her husband is an ass. I also found it improbable that her hubby would be so blantantly adulterous given the time era, and uncomfortable that she kept putting herself in improper situations (like travelling with another man).<br/><br/>All in all, it was a pretty flick, but in no way worthy of such an indulgent length, and certainly not of Best Picture status.<br/><br/>Postscript: Binoche is fantastic in this film and definitely the hightlight."

"max von meyerling","4","4","7","23 October 2014"," How did this junk win ten Oscars?
","Then there was THE English PATIENT. There had been a lot of partisan conflict pro and con over THE English PATIENT. It won no less than ten Oscars including Best Picture. Yet there were some who complained bitterly. There was an episode of Seinfeld where Elaine grows exasperated at her friends and colleagues mooning over the film to the point where her boss insists on taking her to see the film and while he sits there teary eyed she squirms in her seat and just shouts out ""Die already!""<br/><br/>Everyone is aghast at Elaine's reaction as they sit teary eyed, overwhelmed by the romance. But what is the romance? It's nothing more than our old friend infidelity, except here it's clothed in the veddy veddy colonial carryings on in Cairo and the western desert in the period before WW2. Falling in love by campfire light while reading Herodotus. Oh please. It reminds me of love scenes in movies where we're assured that it all takes place on 800 thread count sheets. It's making love. I always seem to hear the gravelly voice of Henry Miller saying, ""Don't you mean f**king?""<br/><br/>Of course the story is told in flashbacks. Now usually flashbacks are a narrative devise used to reveal the plot non-sequentially. But here the use of flashbacks is merely to draw out this basic story of infidelity and revenge for more than two hours. It's like one of those $500 hamburgers. It's got wagyu beef and truffles but it's still a hamburger.<br/><br/>If it were taking place in a Bronx tenement it would all be over in half an hour. It would be just another double murder/suicide. But with everybody downing gin and tonics at the club and a bit of the old scholars shuffle in colonial offices, it presents a certain retro romanticism (at least as far as furnishings and accessories go) which is beyond the experience of the audience but which they want to believe existed. I've been to these places and people are so bored that adultery is the rule rather than the exception. There's nothing else to do but to screw each other's wives and when that grows tiresome to have a bash at the local brothels. A steady flow of tourists is a bit too much to be hoped for.<br/><br/>Tits and ass with class Lenny Bruce would call it. This drawing things out reminds me of reality TV or the quiz programs which tease before they say the answer is right and we'll get to see something we're promised after some adverts. This is why Elaine became so frustrated.<br/><br/>Of course the action, while filled with incident, is patently absurd. First of all, it doesn't pass my Lady Bracknell test. One suicide by bi-plane can only be regarded as a misfortune. But two suicides by bi-plane suggests carelessness. Just a little gold flake on our burger.<br/><br/>Then there's the part where our hero walks three days through the desert to bring back some help for his love that he leaves battered and bleeding in a cave. He finally makes it to the British outpost. Somehow in between the first bi-plane suicide and our hero's arrival WW2 has broken out and instead of raising the alarm and getting help for his lady love, he is interned. The interment is done by a sergeant major. Now they may be the backbone of the British Army but they do not have the authority to arrest and intern people willy-nilly. If someone walked into town from the desert and there was anything suspicious about him, he would have to be debriefed by Intelligence, which would have meant he would have been interrogated by an officer. Once he met an officer they would have matched up friends in Cairo and help would be on the way.<br/><br/>The fact that he had a foreign name would have meant little because obviously he was a gentleman. There was a similar incident in WW I where a British spy was found in the Sinai with the name Meinertzhagen and he turned out to be a British Officer (see the incident in The Lighthorsemen). So, no British Sergeant Major was likely to assume the authority of an officer in interning a foreign gentleman whatever his name or nationality was.<br/><br/>But OK, lets move on.<br/><br/>When our hero is interred and escapes it's the first days of the war. The Afrika Korps arrived in early 1941. What had he been doing until then? He delivers his maps to them in exchange for a bi-plane that had previously been squirreled away. Hadn't he returned to the cave in the year and a half of freedom? So he too smashes into the desert with horrible burns. He is rescued and brought to a British medical unit.<br/><br/>Now this gets me. Instead of sending him on to an equipped hospital in Tobruk or Alexandria or Cairo even, they schlepp him through the loss of Tobruk, the victory at El Alamein, the landings in Sicily, the fight up the Italian boot to wind up in Florence (champagne for the burger?). He's a burn patient after all and they hold on to them moving him around from battle to battle for four years. Not sending him to a hospital. Seems a bit incredible. Seems insane.<br/><br/>Thus the other reason for the flashback structure–time makes no sense here. On the Wikipedia page for the novel it's categorized as ""meta fiction"". I know Borges was able to freeze a bullet in time to give a philosopher about to be executed time to finish his work. But that was exactly what the story was ""about"". Here time means nothing. It's just something to be dipped into to supply incident and drama. Its crudely manipulative, exposed by its distortion of any logic, by its deliberate defiance of verisimilitude."

The movie touches on the points of WWII that we don't always see, from Kip the demolitions expert to Hana the nurse (a well played role).

You don't have to like the English Patient and you don't have to think it is an important film, but if you think Die Hard is a better film (and that is what the IMDB votes say!) then there can be no hope for cinema. Not as an important art form at least.<br/><br/>The image of this film is of a stiff romantic talk-piece (partly the fault of the promotion people) but it is not, lots happens and there is no time when you can predict what is going to happen next. This is a three hour movie because it needs three hours to tell the story and get inside the many characters. <br/><br/>I wouldn't suggest that this film is perfect. The bomb disposal scenes are pure cod drama and plenty is borrowed from other people's movies - Out of Africa and the general works of David Lean kept springing to mind. I have no idea whether Binoche (here playing a nurse) can really act, because I have never actually seen her do any. She is reduced to looking on with care or looking wide eyed with wonder, maybe that is enough for some people?<br/><br/>
(Clearly it was for the Oscar people - she won the Best Supporting Actress award!)<br/><br/>Lead Fiennes manages to produce a performance of total paradox in managing to be both cold and romantic as well as conveying emotion through horrific burns make up. I am not so sure about the accent, but I am not sure what an Hungarian linguist sounds like when speaking English! Lover Kristin Scott-Thomas has less to do, but I loved her restraint: sexy and passionate while never throwing anything in your face.<br/><br/>The English Patient is one of those films you walk away from thinking ""I didn't know they still made films like that"", I hope that I can say it again some time soon, but I am not holding my breath."

","Beautiful, beautiful film.  Ralph Fiennes is absolutely incredible.  I didn't at first like Kristen Scott-Thomas' character as Katherine; not that she didn't act it well, but that I simply didn't approve of Katherine (Disrespected women who know how to sew? Didn't want to bargain?  Didn't understand what the Count meant when he said that he didn't want to be owned?  Was she a moron? What kind of woman could possibly say those things?).  But having seen the film over and over, now, I approve of Scott-Thomas' acting so much that I have excused the character of Katherine her weird modern flaws.  The movie dragged a bit in the parts with Dafoe. I thought the strange side-story of Binoche and her lover distracting against the possessive love story that would have been even more powerful if left in Fiennes' and Scott-Thomas' hands.  Binoche is lovely, it wasn't her fault. Overall, Ralph Fiennes carried this movie just as he has several of his films.  What a hit.  Fiennes steals my very breath, as always. 9/10<br/><br/>-Angel, TX"
"thechosen1","9","4","7","9 August 2002"," Excellent = Ralph Fiennes
","Now, here you have one of the best movies ever starring some of the best actors ever....Ralph Fiennes (brilliant, brilliant, brilliant), Willem Dafoe, Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche.  This movie was very touching and extremely well made.  It explores the characters to great depths and gradually unfolds each of their stories.  Every minute was worth watching and it definitely did not disappoint me in any aspect.  Also, it was one of the very few movies which had a very good ending.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes (as Laszlo De Almasy) was just pure brilliance (and as good looking as one can possibly get).  His performance was just amazing, considering that he is unable to move during most of the movie, so his expressions were absolutely incredible. He has deserved every Oscar nomination that he has got.  <br/><br/>Willem Dafoe (Caravaggio), as usual, gave a fine performance to an otherwise, dry character. The best thing about Dafoe is that he can make relatively dull characters actually have their presence felt in the movie. No doubt, one of Hollywood's greatest actors.  <br/><br/>Juliette Binoche (Hana), not only looked beautiful, she also showed that she is a superb actress.  Just her expressions in the interaction with Fiennes in the movie did her character complete justice.<br/><br/>I just love the way Kristin Scott Thomas (Katherine) plays her roles.  She just seems so natural to it all.  Her dialogue delivery and facial expressions were excellent.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.  10/10."

","I am slightly surprised by the overwhelming positive reviews given to this movie. I understand that the cinematography is good, acting is decent and overall the movie is OK, but Oscar for best movie, even before Fargo? Please!<br/><br/>My main gripe is that it seems like a glorified one night stand. I am not criticizing this movie from a moral standpoint. I have no issues with people sleeping around. What bothers me most is that there was absolutely no effort by the director to develop the main characters of Ralph Fiennes (RF) and Kristin Scott Thomas (KST). RF is a wooden, dis- respectful loner and KST is a bored housewife. They spend a couple of days in desert and start sleeping around. I understand this. It can happen. But they are madly in love? Really? Why? What was it in RF's character that made KST's character to fall for him completely? Except many of those love scenes, I can't point a single instance where I felt that there was something happening between the two. It just felt that director was focusing so much on passion (read numerous one night - day - afternoon stands) that it seemed nonsensical. <br/><br/>The only slightly likable character is that of Juliet Binoche as Hanna. Her acting is good. But she has been underutilized. And even in her case, her affection for the Sikh soldier (Naveen Andrews) seems so made up and fake.<br/><br/>Why do two people fall in love with each other and remain in love till the end? If you think that the English Patient will give any answers then look elsewhere. Its a huge disappointment."

","This film is very much like the Aviator. Not much explanation and not much else really. It is probably one of the slowest films you'll ever watch. You'll keep checking what the time is as you're going through it. It's a film almost completely devoid of entertainment, which should have been replaced with emotion (the sort you get a la Sean Penn), but alas not. What you get instead is a film which has a few moments of inspiration, but then descends back into the dusty hands of the scenic settings. A couple of the characters are likable, which is one of the good things that hold the whole thing together. However, our main couple - the Count and (flip, I can't remember her name) the American woman - are not at all likable. They come across as being shallow, vindictive little creatures and this would all be fine and dandy, but there's no reason to support why these people are like this. Much of their intimate acting is seriously hammed up and some moments are unintentionally laughable. The real heroes are Kip and Hana, though the scene in the church is a bit of pure cheese. They make a sweet couple and its reasonably saddening when they have to say goodbye. Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews should have got the congrats at the Oscars, but alas the Oscars has been a sham for many years (two words: Johnny Depp). The film also shows that Binoche should be the holder of the Fighting With Inanimate Objects award."

I guess Hollywood is trying to tell us, hey, if you get the serious hots for someone, it's okay to have an affair.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie with characters you can believe in and empathize with, watch ""Sling Blade"".

","Working with cinemas, I am constantly surprised at what the industry has approved. Every week she churns out another laughable/dull story, masquerading behind a facade of beautiful cinematography or some loud noises and spectacular explosions.<br/><br/>Of the latter variety, we find a list including such almost homo-erotic classics as Rambo, and the unforgiveable Under-Siege. The former would include 7 years in Tibet, Pearl Harbour. The English Patient unfortunately does little to stem the tide of s***e that drowns the public in an oppressive mediocrity. In fact it muscles in its posterior and seats its fat arse between these two muppets of Hollywood History.<br/><br/>Before discordance escalates about my review, I would like to say that despite being male, I do like some romantic films. The fact that it is a romance is not my problem. My problem is that this film is utterly rubbish.<br/><br/>If you don't want to know what happens then don't read the following -<br/><br/>
A burnt Hungarian guy hangs out with some nurse and has flashbacks about an affair he had. Then some guy without any thumbs shows up demanding a little screen-time.<br/><br/>The main protagonists in the flashbacks are unbearably self-centered and include a naive dumbass (Firth), a self-pitying slapper (Scott-Thomas) and an obsessive fool who seems more interested in owning a woman than loving one (Feinnes).<br/><br/>This film cuts in neither in a plot-driven nor Character-driven genre. Any political undertones were quickly shoved under the carpet to discourage too much thought.<br/><br/>So how come so many people like it? One word would be 'Cinematography'. Would anyone like this if it had a less beautiful setting?... say in Hull or Wolverhampton? I doubt it. Maybe the last 15 minutes were magnificent but I thought my arse had been punished enough. There is absolutely no excuse for the feats of willpower one has to endure in watching such an overblown and simply uneventful pass at a film."
"PresterJ","2","7","15","16 June 1999"," Such unfulfilled promise is a crime.
","Few flims have disappointed me so deeply as this one.  The cinematography is beautiful, and I honestly don't think I can count on my hands the number of films I have seen that were more visually stunnning. But the praise ends there.  The film promises a tragic romance, but delivers only stagnant plot movement, seemingly drawn out to prolong the background scenery, and flat, shallow characters with whom I did not find any sympathy.  Indeed, I found the love affair a tad repulsive, and the immorality of the characters does play some role in this.  The majority of my dissatisfaction, however, resides with my lack of interest in their lives: if the characters have emotion, the audience is not brought to share in that emotion.  I felt quite numb watching this movie, and that is a terrible mistake for a tragic work... tragedy relies on emotion and sympathy, both of which are absent here. The main symbolic thread of the story, the Count's memory and his book, suffers from the same malaise: if it were easier to care about his character, his memories would be very touching.  Unfortunately, the film does not do its job in executing this idea. In short, there are great possibilities in this film for an excellent overall work, but it seems that the story was neglected in favour of adding effort to the visual aesthetics.  Usually, films are revised to add new effects to an existing storyline... Sabrina comes to mind.  In this case, the director should be given a second chance to dazzle audiences with a stunning remake, to add emotion to the existing effects."

","Years ago, I saw an episode of SEINFELD in which Elaine described this movie as a colossal bore that seemed to go on forever (though less than 3 hours long, it did seem to go on for an eternity). I should have taken her advice and avoided this movie like the plague. The first tip-off that it would be a bore-fest was that it had won so many academy awards. In recent years, several amazingly dull films have been the recipient of arm loads of awards but were box office poison because the public couldn't stand them (another example of this would the the sterile LAST EMPEROR).<br/><br/>My wife and I were amazed at how much we disliked the film. The ""love"" affair between the leads was completely unbelievable and stupid. One minute, they hate each other and the next they are copulating like crazed weasels! And, to top this off, these were perhaps the ugliest stars ever seen naked on the screen. I kept wanting to shout ""put it BACK on--PLEASE"". In fact, they were such an unappealing couple that I strongly recommend parents send their teenagers to watch this film. The sight of their naked bodies is perhaps the strongest enticement towards abstinence known to mankind!<br/><br/>However, the ugliness of the film doesn't end there. Towards the end, in order to try to save his lover's life, the male lead makes a deal to help the Nazis....yes, Nazis!!! Who cares that they were trying to take over the world and liquidate a few million?! All his character cared about was his sweetie. Oh, and did I mention that along the way they ended up killing her husband? Nothing says romance like this film!!"

The only part that left any impression on me at all was the part which I couldn't bear to watch (the part about the ""fingers"").

","A flawed masterpiece wanna-be. David Lean is the past, long live Minghella. Or something like that. Or not. The movie's strong point is that it remains interesting in spite of its length, even though there are some moments of tedium around the middle. The fact that the movie isn't too dull makes up for its weaknesses.<br/><br/>The movie's weakest point is the casting of the doomed lovers. Scott Thomas and Fiennes have no chemistry going. He is as cold and distant as ever; he can't help it - that aloof English exterior is his trademark, whether he likes it or not. But the bigger problem is Thomas. She is far too unattractive to play the part, and when she takes her clothes off we are shocked to see that her body is in even worse shape than her face. She is a mess. A movie of such ambition and scope HAS to have a stunningly beautiful, charismatic leading lady, and a passionate, charismatic leading man. Just picture this movie with Gable and de Havilland. Or, since it's a 90s movie and the choice for such a film is slim, how about McGregor and Collette. Or Pitt andÂ… Oh, hell, almost ANY actress is better-looking than Thomas! I'll never understand why Minghella chose to show Thomas entirely nude, while we get only brief glimpses of the far better-looking (which isn't saying much), better built Binoche. The worst thing about it all is that Thomas is sold to the viewer as some kind of beauty. Well, you have to be gay, mad or blind to buy into that.<br/><br/>The story is well-constructed, but contains an incredibly stupid plot-device: the allies arresting Fiennes - who has a British accent - just because his name is unusual is very dumb and unconvincing, indeed. It wouldn't matter so much were it not crucial to the tragic outcome. Minghella had to think of a way why Fiennes would betray his country in order to save his girl, but he couldn't think of anything good so he came up with this nonsense. I also think that he overdid it with the predictable tragedies; it is okay to have one suicide in a movie, but two?? One guy kills himself after finding out about Fiennes's betrayal. The other guy, Firth, dives like a kamikaze pilot into Fiennes. It's all just a bit much. The same can be said of the surprising vertical-sex scene; I am used to Michael Douglas screwing his female co-stars on the wall or furniture, but to have non-horizontal sex of this kind in a wanna-be Lean movie is too much.<br/><br/>I don't understand why Thomas attacks Fiennes when she appears in his suite just before they bonk for the first(?) time. And I was not at all impressed by that scene where the Indian entertains Binoche with some rope-fresco-spotting nonsense: that kind of pretentious stuff is right out of one of those dull ""arty"" European movies."

After hearing about this film for months, and watching it steal the majority of that year's Academy Award, I was expecting something fantastic.  So, the entire movie while I watched one guy trying to get help and bring it back for his girl, I wondered how they got there.  To tell you the truth, I was bored out of my mind.  Not only is the plot slow-moving, the character development and larger purpose of the movie is vague at best.  The only thing that kept me watching through the entire excrutiating three hours was the suspense: what happened to these people?

Couldn't they kiss like normal human beings??<br/><br/>4) I never feel that Colin Firth is a jealous husband until the very end.<br/><br/>5) And the line ""You can't kill me. I died long ago."" didn't make sense to me. Wouldn't that mean his love for Katherine was nothing? He was dead during that relationship? Wow.

Maybe it wasn't commercial enough.<br/><br/>So don't waste practically 3 hours of your time with this movie. Not unless you want an almost 3 hour nap. If you want to see Fiennes as a cynical lover see ""The End of the Affair"". An excellent movie with all the good things about the ""The English Patient"" with an exception of the desert. If you want to see the REAL best movie of 1996 see ""Fargo"". And if you want to see a good movie directed by Anthony Minghella see ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (even though its adaptation was far from faithful to the book.)

"powermandan","10","3","5","27 January 2015"," An Underrated Masterpiece!
","The English Patient is a 1996 adaptation from the book of the same name that has a reputation as being too long, boring, overrated, and one of the worst movies to win so many Academy Awards including Best Picture and Director. I agree with some of these negative claims up to a certain extent, but the movie has redemption.<br/><br/>The English Patient is about a mysterious man (Fiennes) with no identity who is horribly burnt after a plain crash and is cared for by a french-Canadian nurse (Binoche). He reveals that he is Count Almasy and tells the story of his affair with married Katherine (Thomas) and their journeys in the Sahara desert and the surrounding corruption and betrayal.<br/><br/>I will agree that The English Patient is too long. 163 minutes is a bit of a stretch and causes there to be some boring moments. If twenty minutes of the movie was cut, the result would have been better. But the length does not make for anything bad. That is what people overstate. That is why the episode of Seinfeld when Elaine hated The English Patient was so funny. Dissing this movie just because it's a bit long and has dull moments is far-fetched. Like Lawrence of Arabia and The Searchers, The English Patient is full of glamorous and lovely shots of the sun-filled desert. If you find this movie boring, it is not bad to look away from. The flashback story of the patient's pre-burn days is the better half of the movie and is wondrous. The burn days for him aren't very wondrous, but are still worth seeing.<br/><br/>The English Patient won many awards, beating everybody's favourite, Fargo. Fargo is a true masterpiece, but The English Patient isn't that far behind it. I watched The English Patient twice; I enjoyed it the first time, but loved it the second. It was a major leap. Just why did The English Patient win Best Picture and Best Director? Simple: The English Patient has more to it. In fact, The English Patient was more deserving of its win for Best Director. Although the Coen brothers filmed Fargo to a very high degree, Anthony Minghella provides calibre filming, enchanting shots on location, beautiful costumes, haunting make-up, unbeatable sets, and glowing music. Fargo does not have all these. What Fargo does have may outweigh everything else in 1996, The English Patient offered more than any other movie in 1996.<br/><br/>4/4"

The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the ""good life"" from England.<br/><br/>All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples.<br/><br/>The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it.<br/><br/>Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England.<br/><br/>Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many.<br/><br/>This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people).<br/><br/>The good times are over, but ""The English Patient"" (1998) provides an important ""homage"" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world.<br/><br/>Nice work if you can get it! <br/><br/>------------------- <br/><br/>Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor.<br/><br/>Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com <br/><br/>Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen"

","Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count László de Almásy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the ""hero"" deliberately sells out the British — the West — to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason."
"jaredmobarak","9","3","5","26 October 2008"," For the heart is an organ of fire  The English Patient
","The titular English patient is Count Laszlo de Almásy who we are introduced to as his plane is shot down in a fiery crash, leaving his entire body badly burned. It appears as though he has lost his memory too, except for an uncanny ability to name every song he hears. Almásy loves to sing, as he is told throughout the film, in both his past and present, so this trick is not too out of place. He is on his last leg, the crash left him close to death, and eventually the military caravan he is apart of goes on while he and his nurse stay holed up in an abandoned Italian Villa. The nurse, Hana, has seen her own bits of tragedy during the war as her love was killed and then her best friend, seconds after talking to her, is blown up by a land mine. Everyone she loves seems to be perishing around her, so to get away with her patient is an appealing answer to the grief and anger bottled inside. The two are very alike, especially after we hear Almásy speaking of his wife, who we can only assume was the woman in the plane with him when it crashes. We won't know the truth until we delve into the dreamstate memories of his past, the years leading up to the point he is at now. His days as a mapmaker in Africa and the affairs and dealings he participates in once the war breaks.<br/><br/>There are a lot of timeline maneuvering, but it's always grounded through our lead character Almásy. Ralph Fiennes is either under burn victim prosthetics (the present) or shown whole in the desert (the past). The surrounding roles also help as we soon realize the instances with Kristen Scott Thomas delineate the past from those moments with Juliette Binoche's Hana, caring for our lead in Italy. The way Fiennes dreams all his flashbacks make it tough for we the audience to decide whether he has amnesia or is just faking it to try and forget the pastan idea set forth by Willem Dafoe's mysterious Caravaggio, a man that is not telling the complete truth, yet entrenching himself in the middle of the action. His past shows him in the deserts converting photographs into maps for the British army to use for the war that is brewing. It is a life of work amongst men and friends until a couple benefactors, one a photographer, come to visit. The arrival of Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton (Colin Firth and Scott Thomas respectively) turns the entire dynamic on its head. Fiennes' strict bachelor finds a woman who fascinates him. A strong, educated, and independent one that just might feel the same about him.<br/><br/>This is not just any affair, though, but instead one with dire consequences. Those that Almásy and Katharine touch will all be affected because of the war and the sides that are forming. What was once a world of equality and kinship, with multiple ethnicities and nationalities all teaming up on the cartology project, becomes one of enemies and allies on opposite ends of a harsh brutal battle. The reverberations from their trysts are felt for years to come as grudges stay held and alliances are made. Why does Almásy keep referring to a wife when we know he never has one? What relationship does Caravaggio truly hold with him, if any? Why are he and Katharine flying in territory that risked them getting shot down and killed? There are so many questions for which hinge on Almásy remembering his past. We want him to remember because we want to know what happened to bring him to where he is, alone and disfigured, only wanting one more day in the rain before he dies.<br/><br/>But it is not all about this journey. We also are treated to Binoche's Hana's evolution as a woman trying to survive a war that appears to kill everyone she holds dear. What was to be a retreat of isolation beside her patient becomes a boarding house for Dafoe's character as well as a team of bomb diffusers led by Naveen Andrews' Kip. Everyone's favorite Iraqi torturer from ""Lost"" was billed higher than Firth in an Oscar winning film back in 1996. Where has he been since? I don't know, but I'm glad he has returned to the scene because he shows again here that he deserves to be. An Indian Sikh, he becomes the person that could show Hana she is not cursed. He can be a love that won't go away, one to break her from the shell she has hidden herself behind. Theirs becomes a relationship that mirrors Almásy's own with Katharine, allowing his thoughts to dwell on that happy time and eventually let spill what really happened.<br/><br/>Six people's lives intertwine through over a decade in Europe and Africa, meeting accidentally and purposely with both large and small results. Each has a hand in the future of the other, whether they are aware of it or not. One move by any of them can be a life or death decision for the rest. As a result, this story could have become contrived to the point of absurdity in order to make it all happen. However, this fact is what makes the film so successful, because it never falls into that trap. The English Patient is natural and fluid throughout its lengthy duration with each coincidence and uncovered secret seeming to be as realistic as possible. I never once doubted the activities nor motives of any involved and while it may drag a bit around the hour and a half mark, the final 45 minutes or so make up for everything. Something can be said for the hidden truth being revealed after so much anticipation and buildup. Minghella took the novel and crafted a riveting piece of romantic drama, captivating its audience and delivering on every promise  absolutely."
"ajsb55","10","3","5","6 September 2008"," Beautiful Movie
","Anthony Minghella is one of my favorite directors. Cold Mountain, Talented Mr. Ripley all were great and there are some similar parts in all his movies. The English patient however is the best movie he has ever done. Its a beautiful movie. The script was great and the acting was phenomenal. This is one of the movies were Ralph Fiennes deserved to win the Oscar. The main theme song in this movie is very emotional and one of my favorite soundtracks.<br/><br/>Some people might call it long but you have to admire everything that is happening and really get into the movie to love it. I wish that they would make more movies like this. This is one of the few movies that have made it on my favorites list."
"JCfan-3","Null","3","5","18 June 1999"," Overrated, should have won at the Raspberry Jam Awards
","This is a bad, bad film. Minghella's previous film was a brilliant romantic comedy named Mr. Wonderful. Then he got pretentious and fell in love with the Oscars. This film is filled with Oscar Winner cliches, has no pace and no interest whatsoever. Not even the acting. If you wanna see the great Willem Dafoe, check out The Last Temptation of Christ, which is an absolute masterpiece and has a wonderful performance by Willem. But please, stay out from this film. Score: 2 out of 10 (at least it has good cinematography). Come to think of it, it does have its moments, so let's leave it to a 4 out of 10."
"SKG-2","10","3","5","29 March 1999"," Excellent film best of 1996
","Once again, it seems I must rise to defend yet another film from the most prevalent syndrome of the 90's; yes, the backlash syndrome.  No sooner does a film that is popular with critics, audiences, or both, than comes a knee-jerk instinct for someone to say, ""If other people like it, or love it, this must stink!""  I'm not denying there were people who honestly didn't like this, but if there's one trend I'd like to see disappear, it's the backlash syndrome.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought this film was terrific.  First, it looked stunning, and director Anthony Minghella gave each story a distinct look, from the browns and whites of the desert, and the past love affair between Almasy and Catherine, to the rainbow like colors of Italy, and the story of Hana taking care of the mysterious ""English Patient.""  As big a fan as I am of dialogue scenes, what I remember from this movie is some of the images, especially the scene with Hana looking at wall murals while going up and down on a rope line.  Second, he takes the story of the novel (which I liked) and makes it more accessible without losing the essentially elliptic tone.  So the two stories - Almasy and Catherine, Hana and Kip(and, essentially, ghosts) - come together without being sentimental.  Lastly, the performances.  Like their stories, Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche create two different women, one cool on the outside and passionate on the inside, the other vice versa.  Like one critic pointed out, it's like both are joined together in Almasy's mind, since they're two sides of the same coin.  And Ralph Fiennes continues his string of excellent performances, being caustic and remote while hiding a deep and smoldering love for Catherine, and then turning around and being fatalistic and witty to comfort Hana.  This was my favorite film of 1996, and it stands that way, no matter what the ""backlash"" crowd feels."

My advice to those who haven`t seen this movie yet: Forget everything what you have read, and heard about this picture and just go see it.<br/><br/>I won`t say anything about the storyline, except a for a few keywords; Love, Passion, Anger and Salvation. It`s a modern day Greek-tragedy dished up in a world war two setting, performed by beautiful people, in a breathtaking landscape."
"MicheBel","9","3","5","13 January 1999"," Separating the Men from the Boys
","This movie, almost more than any other, separates those who have a soul and can appreciate art from those who don't/can't. Usually, this falls along the lines of women loving it/men hating it. I'm not sure why this is exactly, but I've gotten into more fights over this movie.  I was swept up by the grandeur, the passion, the romantic settings. I believed it completely and loved nearly every moment of it. Many others snooze right through it. That, I don't understand at all. What no one can argue about is that it is visually stunning. Hey, I love Ralph (that's Rafe to you buddy) Fiennes, even in his burn casing thing. Juliette Binoche is luminous, rightly deserving of that Oscar (sit down, Lauren). Willem Dafoe is at his creepiest. What is not to like about this movie?"
"genius-15","Null","3","5","26 September 1999"," Yet Another Boring Experiment in Pseudointellectualism
","To be brief (unlike the movie) the english patient was hollow and uninteresting. The people who rave about it are just flattering themselves by pretending to be fine arts aficionados. Besides being too long (160 minutes), english patient is riddled with chronological inaccuracies (which is fine, but then why did the writers limit themselves with historical constraints if they weren't going to adhere to them?) and story gaps (even the most charlatan of filmgoers wouldn't dare claim to have understood most of the plot). Ralph Fiennes is not a talented actor, even his Schindler's List performance was lacking, but he somehow blends into this mediocre film. And the love scenes?? Please. Aside from a few cheap beaver shots of Kristin Scott Thomas, they were just recast versions of The Young and the Restless. I never tell people not to see a movie, no matter how bad it is, but don't be surprised if you find yourself checking your watch every two minutes when viewing this one."
"Colashwood","2","7","17","25 October 2003"," Sad mistake
","No offense meant, but except for Binoche and Scott Thomas, the film was - for me - a huge, sad and tasteless mistake. I was so bored by the whole thing that I kept on brooding about Fiennes' unrealistic make-up and the sheer ugliness of the Italian frescoes. These parodies of life's extremes - extreme beauty, extreme pain -  are as hapless as the film itself."

I really connected with her character's story but unfortunately Hana's story was only a sub-plot to the Count and Katherine's doomed love story.<br/><br/>I have to say, nothing surprised me about this film, doomed love and love triangles have been done before, a thousand times. I felt no sympathy for the Count or Katherine, at the end of the film I felt that they had gotten what they deserved. I think for someone to feel that way about a love story is a damning testament to the way a film is made, particularly this one. I ended up feeling more sorry for Katherine's husband (played admirably by Colin Firth) than for the Count or Katherine.<br/><br/>I'm a great fan of love stories and romance but this just didn't do anything for me. I didn't like the two leads at all and I certainly didn't connect with them. I found the sub-plots far more interesting than the main story line. Defoe, Firth and Binoche were great and I was far more compelled by them than by Fiennes or Scott Thomas.<br/><br/>In short I'd just like to say that once is enough to watch this film. I've only seen it once and I have to say, my time could have been better spent. Not a deserving Oscar winner by any stretch of the imagination."

It portrays life in WWII quite accurately, and the love story is amazing.  The love story made the movie so incredible.  I felt this interesting feeling, of passion or something.  It made me want to watch the movie over and over again.  Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors and the way they played their characters is amazing.

"tfrizzell","Null","4","8","25 June 2000"," An Old Time Epic Made in the Present
","What swept viewers off their feet about this film is the way it is made like so many other great epics of the golden age of Hollywood.  However, this film is so ambitious it nearly collapses under its own weight.  Anthony Minghella's tight direction and Juliette Binoche's Oscar-winning performance are the main factors that keep the film afloat.  The film takes place in 1944 but flashes back to the late 1930s and to a plane being shot down. The only survivor of the plane, a burned pilot only known as ""The English Patient"", tells his story to a French-Canadian nurse played by Binoche.  At times the flashbacks become tedious and Binoche saves the film on more than one occasion.  Ralph Fiennes probably has his best performance to date, but Kristin Scott Thomas's character never engrossed me the way the film makers had wished.  Willem Dafoe's quiet performance is almost as dynamic and dark as Fiennes's, in spite of his limited screen time.  This film won nine Oscars in 1996.  I cannot complain about this film winning the Best Picture but it will not likely survive the years as well as ""Fargo"", which was probably the best overall film from that year.  4.5 out of 5 stars."

But, hey--he looks like a model and has great sex so we are supposed to root for him! Yeah, it's beautiful to look at for a while, and the sound track is sort of cool in an exotic world-music ""see how Bohemian we are!"" sort of way. There is a scene near the end where they are swinging along in some sort of cave with a torch looking at great old frescoes. It has absolutely nothing to do with anything else in the movie, but no doubt it flatters the target audience--""We are artistic. We are sensitive.

"folsominc2","2","5","11","19 March 2008"," Are you Patient enough for this?
","OK, what was this story about again? I am afraid that I never read the book and frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies that I have ever tried to watch in a long time. I get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man with no thumbs. The film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world they all knew each other to come together.<br/><br/>After recently seeing the ""Pride and Prejudice"" movie with Colin Firth, I have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his, and bluntly, other than ""What a Girl Wants"" I am not finding much where he played in that was any good. I am definitely not saying that HE wasn't good. He is really one of the best actors I have seen in the modern day film, but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" is another perfect example of where the director, writer, and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture  literally. The entire movie seemed to be to showcase Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emoting that was a bore. Nothing is really explained and every one of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalyst evaluation! <br/><br/>Kristin Scott Thomas' character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and titillating other men other than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all his marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent  I guess; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows it all. The rest of the cast is cast (pun intended) to the four winds as the plot wanders on.<br/><br/>The subplot of the mental stability of the nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unsavory taste. But of course, the viewer is still reeling how in the world the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex the first time anyway. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no build-up. Just a slap, bam, thank you! <br/><br/>And isn't it romantic that Fiennes ended up a traitor helping the Germans by giving them maps to the desert? (sarcasm) <br/><br/>To describe this movie, I would have to simply say, ""How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet, adorable husband who loves you."" <br/><br/>The final unbelievable section of this plot is to fathom how anyone would choose Ralph Fiennes over Colin Firth. Firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents  in fact, when watching the movie, I thought it must have been one of his first. The scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two second clip that is worth seeing in the movie. At that, I have no interest in watching it again.<br/><br/>The best scene I liked was the plane crash where Firth is trying to take them all out. Too bad he missed! It would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film. Aerial desert scenes were pretty neat, though."

","If you are not into necrophilia that strange erotic passion for corpses, that has inspired better films, such as ""Psycho""- you may need the patience of a phlegmatic Englishman to enjoy ""The English Patient"", the never-ending motion picture by Anthony Minghella, writer-director who made an excellent debut with the wonderful and supernatural romantic comedy ""Truly Madly Deeply"", which not too many people saw, because somebody had the not so bright idea of calling it ""the intelligent version of 'Ghost'."" According to Aristotle's definition of drama, drama is action, and action is change: if someone changes in this movie, it is the jinxed Canadian nurse Hana (French actress Juliette Binoche), and this is the story of her exorcism. If this coming and going from scenes in the present to the recent past, has any sense between scenes taking place during the last days of Second World War, when Hana takes care of a burnt count (British actor Ralph Fiennes), and scenes of his past, in which we learn that he is a Hungarian archaeologist who discovered a cave with little drawings, that he wrote a book without adjectives, that he collaborated with Rommel and that he had an affair with a married English woman--, if this jumble has an end, it is to free Hana from her evil spell, haunted by death and bad luck. Hana's lover dies in the first reel, and her best friend, another nurse, is disposed of after a few minutes of projection, when she dies on a mined road in Italy. Hana decides to stay in an abandoned church with the count and a good amount of morphine, to wait until the count dies. In the meantime, he remembers, remembers, remembers and remembers, in one of the most repetitive and boring scheme of cinematic flashbacks in recent years, in a story overloaded with subplots, maps, recognition flights, spying, colonialism, drug addiction, panoramic views of Africa, and clothes, cars and planes from the 1940's, probably placed there for us to say ""Wow, great production design!"" or ""Great production values!"" This paraphernalia makes little else but divert the attention from Hana, the only character who goes through a true process of change. But the development is diffuse and distributed among too many flashbacks, and the film loses cohesion and focus. If the flashbacks are highlighted by the presence of British actress Kristin Scott Thomas as the attractive and interesting Katherine, the count's lover, unfortunately she dies too soon, when she spends too many days in the desert, in the cave with little drawings that her lover found. When the count finds her body, he lays by its side, cries and then, taking it in his arms, goes to the exterior and makes such a strange face, that one does not know if it should be taken as a great romantic scene, if it is because of the sun on his eyes or due to the decaying body's odor. All of this is supposed to be based on true facts, according to Sri Lanka writer Michael Ondaatje. I tell you, you really need English patience! While Hana, faithful to her death passion, falls in love with Kip (Anglo-Indian actor Naveen Andrews), a sikh expert in detecting mines, risking his life from day to day, all kinds of characters appear and disappear from the frame, as the ones played by American Willem Dafoe, German Jürgen Prochnow and Italian Nino Castelnuovo, in case you did not know this is an international super-production (that was advertised with an ""independent"" tag Independent from what?) Poor Ralph Fiennes, as the toasted count, spends much of his screen time under a latex mask, with convenient white veins that shine in night scenes. Although the movie has good intentions and fine scenes especially those related to the romance of the count and Katherine-, and in spite of the many Oscars it won (it was not a very good year in Hollywood), for your own good, you better make a trip to the nearest cemetery."

"TheMaster01","9","2","3","4 February 2015"," A Poetic Masterpiece
","Love in the present, Love in the past; ""The English Patient"" is a love story through and through, and one of the best I might add. In a year of tornadoes twisting, aliens arriving, schoolgirls screaming and Cuba Gooding Jr. creating catchphrases; The English Patient soared high as an epic that was definitely deserving of its win. I know that this is not an opinion which is universally agreed upon (Leigh's ""Secrets & Lies"" has a heavy following, as does the Coen's ""Fargo"") but 'The English Patient' has all of the ingredients of a gorgeous and enchanting epic, a film which deserves to be respected. <br/><br/>Based on the 1992 novel of the same name (written by Michael Ondaatje), the film dips back and forth between past and present with one man at the centre of it all: the English Patient. In the present he is a patient, badly burnt due to a plane crash and cared to by a young war nurse in an Old Italian Villa. These are the final days of the Second World War. Our protagonist (although it's initially difficult to tell) is portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, who after a stellar performance in Schindler's List, continued to push out another terrific role as Count Laszlo de Almasy. Fiennes is superb in the portrayal of a man whose history is a mystery, and whose current charred state has aided in turning him into a blank slate. Slowly, but surely, he begins to remember events from his past. It's a performance of great dynamics, intelligence and passion. <br/><br/>Caring for him is Hana, a twenty-something-year-old nurse played by Juliette Binoche, and she is someone to marvel at in this outstanding and affecting performance. Between finding love in a Sapper named Kip (Naveen Andrews) and tending to her English Patient (technically Hungarian by Birth), Binoche unveils the layers of a quiet yet complex character. An independent yet still frightened woman, Binoche is to die for. There is one other member that arrives at the Villa: David Caravaggio (cunningly portrayed by Willem Dafoe) a thief missing both of his thumbs, who initially is there to pinch a bit of morphine, before realising who the English Patient actually is <br/><br/>But as I said, this tale dips between past and present. I've discussed the present enough, so let's jump deeper into the tale. Set in the 1930's, Fiennes is no longer disfigured. He's a co-leader of an archaeological surveying expedition in the African Desert. It is in this time of the story where we meet Katherine and Geoffrey Clifton, a pair of Married British explorers. Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas in her best on-screen performance to date) is the catalyst that sets the story's love affair right off. ""She's Charming and she's read everything"". Count Almasy is mesmerized (for lack of a better word) by Katherine and descends into a love affair that has strong consequences upon both of them. Fiennes and Scott Thomas share some of the best on-screen chemistry in 90's cinema not only in their erotic and sumptuous love scenes, but also the moments when she is still in the presence of her husband George (a fine performance by Colin Firth). You could cut the romantic-friction with a blade. Of course, Firth begins to piece things together and trouble ensues. The relationship between these two contrasts nicely with that of Hana and Kip in the present timeline. One of gentle passion, against the heavy intensity of the affair.<br/><br/>The film is gorgeously shot by John Seale, who deservingly won the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Sand hadn't looked this good since ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and few films of its time could have managed to match the beauty and scope that Seale and director, Anthony Minghella had achieved. Just watch the opening scene as its focused beauty unfolds: Flying across the desert landscape, the shadow of a biplane, glides in and out of frame and the pull-back of the camera reveals a man and woman flying inside. This scene alone (aside from being beautifully shot) sets up the film's story, in the sense that, all of the films events seemingly lead up, and are a result of, what is viewed in this moment. The film will later go on to reveal who these figures are, and why this is significant. Minghella's non- linear timeline may confuse viewers at first, but don't for a moment think that he doesn't know what he is doing. As the plane is shot down, your curiosity and excitement will be awakened. <br/><br/>Aside from directing the film, Minghella also adapted Ondaatje's novel (not butchered, adapted). It's a story of War, Love, Passion, Sin; and told through a vivid and beautiful poetic structure. As said before, Minghella dives between past and present through the use of flashbacks beautifully, and hats off to Walter Murch's smooth editing, piecing these two strands together like a perfect puzzle. <br/><br/>So many points in this film are hard hitting and test the viewer emotionally. But having said that, it's not all tragic. Binoche shares numerous scenes with Naveen Andrews which, yes, ultimately comes to an inevitably sad end, but watch as the two of them swing around the roof of an old church, admiring the paintings to the sound of Gabriel Yared's poetic score. In the midst of tragedy, silver linings can still be found. A love that Hana thought died within her years ago has been rekindled. It's moments like this that restore one's faith in humanity, that make you smile during a film that has conveyed sorrow. That's powerful cinema if you ask me. <br/><br/>The English Patient is a beautiful film, it's the romantic epic that ""Gone with the Wind"" wishes it could be (that's right, I went there). The Ensemble cast is brilliant, and Minghella tells such a great story with a bold and fascinating vision. Screw the haters; ""The English Patient"" is one of the finest war-come-romance films ever made."

"aram81","7","1","1","10 June 2020"," Kristin Scott Thomas is a revelation; the film is beautiful and at times powerful but it's also overlong, overambitious and lacks heart
","The first time I watched this film it left a bitter taste in my mouth. But it made enough of an impression on me that I went back for a second viewing. Now having seen it for a second time, I have to say that I gained more of an appreciation for Anthony Minghella's work. While I still believe that the film is overlong, overambitious and is mostly an exercise of the mind rather than the heart, I would nevertheless recommend it for several reasons. First of all, even though the aforementioned shortcomings make for a film that is a bit tedious in parts and somewhat cold, the story is still a good one and there are powerful moments in this film that will stay with you. Furthermore, the production value and cinematography are spectacular. In short, this is one beautiful motion picture. Last but not least, is the performance of Kristin Scott Thomas. She plays Katharine Clifton with intelligence, strength and gravitas and in the process, steals the show. She is by far the highlight of the film. The English Patient is a dense and layered novel and even though Minghella did not fully succeed in translating the pages to the screen, he still made a respectable, albeit flawed motion picture."
"dr_clarke_2","9","1","1","6 June 2020"," Anthony Minghella's masterpiece
","The English Patient has variously been described as a war film and a romance; it is perhaps best described however as a tragedy. Adapted by writer and director Anthony Minghella from Michael Ondaatje's novel of the same name, it tells the story a mysterious disfigured man being nursed in an abandoned villa at the tail end of World War Two, and gradually unpicks his past and how he came to be injured.
The English Patient is a stately, elegant film, with a carefully written, elegant script. The characterisation is convincing, from the scarred and dying protagonist Almásy who recounts the doomed love affair that culminated in his in injuries, through his nurse Hana, to bomb disposal expert Kip and pretty much everyone else in the movie. The plot unfolds via a non-linear narrative that alternates between scenes set in the story's present and flashbacks as Hana and visiting Canadian Caravaggio gradually learn the truth about Almásy. The story's tragedy lies in the ill-fated love affair between charismatic but aloof explorer and archaeologist Almásy and the married Katharine Clifton, both characters the picture of upper class restraint in the face of growing mutual attraction. Their happiness proves all too brief, as Katherine's husband's pain and jealousy result in her death, and the same series of events eventually lead to Almásy
Interwoven with the story of Almásy and Katherine are other subplots, as we discover what happened to Caravaggio's absent thumbs, and as Hana falls in love with Kip. If there's a problem with The English Patient is that although all of the characters and their stories are compellingly written, the film is quite slow at times and the additional plot threads feel like padding. Nevertheless, the film is largely successful and the horrors of war provide a striking and often horribly well realised backdrop, with some truly unpleasant scenes such as Caravaggio having his thumbs cut off by sadistic Nazi torturers. The scene of Kip disarming the bomb in the pit is incredibly tense: just when it seems it will explode, he successfully renders it harmless, but the scene is juxtaposed with the subsequent death of Sergeant Hardy which is realistically out of the blue and meaningless.
Minghella's direction results in a handsome film, in no small part to the gorgeous location filming, which John Seale's cinematography exploits to full effect. Scenes such as the sandstorm and the German invasion are impressively staged, whilst the make-up used for the hideously wounded Almásy has aged well. The casting is perfect: Ralph Fiennes completely immerses himself in the role of Almásy, and Kristin Scott Thomas, Willem Dafoe, Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews are just as well cast, with strong support provided from the likes of Colin Firth and Kevin Whately. All of the actors give naturalistic performances, which make the tragic pattern of their lives all the more potent (notably, every character of note loses somebody dear to them, even those characters who get an otherwise happy ending). The ending, which sees Almásy convince Hana to commit euthanasia, is poignant rather than mawkish and that's partly due to the acting as well to Minghella's screenplay.
Walter Murch's careful editing is crucial to the success of the film's complex plot, and it is the fact that it reveals the answers to the questions posed by the screenplay a bit at a time that helps to drive the narrative and maintain the audience's interest. The English Patient could perhaps have been a little leaner and a little shorter, but as it stands its still a very impressive piece of work and arguably the highpoint of the late Minghella's well-respected career."

","As is so often the case, I'm very late in getting around to ""The English Patient"", in this case it's been a couple of decades. I recall the fanfare surrounding the movie when it was released, subsequently repeated when it was the winner of nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Told in a series of flashbacks, the story recounts the nature of an affair between Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) and the married Englishwoman Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Their passionate relationship ends in a double tragedy for both principals in a confluence of unrelated events, though it could be maintained just as Almasy stated in my summary line, that he was responsible for her death. One may argue the circumstances of Geoffrey Clinton's (Colin Firth) plane crash, though to my mind his attempt at murder/suicide failed only in the respect that his intended victim was the only one who survived. <br/><br/>I can readily understand the conflicted opinions other reviewers bring to the table here. It's a difficult thing to weigh the difference between an unfaithful spouse and an affair that arises out of true love. On that score, I tend to reserve my sympathies on the side of Katharine and Almasy. Yet the story line throws in a complicated betrayal on the part of The Count, who offered his services to the Nazis in order to return to his injured lover in the desert. In that regard, I do not absolve Almasy for the courage of his convictions, even when he rationalizes that ""thousands of people DID die, just different people"". <br/><br/>Evoking the grand sweep and epic proportions of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the film is a haunting tale of love endured under compromising circumstances that ends unsparingly for the characters and viewer alike. The performances of all the principals are noteworthy, with a special nod to Juliette Binoche in her role as Almasy's nurse as his intricate story unfolds. To be fair, the film requires some patience, as it's nearly three hour run time will test the resolve of uncommitted viewers, though many will find their forbearance well rewarded."

"eric262003","9","1","1","26 March 2018"," Powerhouse Love Story
","Many filmmakers had lost the true meaning of effective powerfully executed love stories delivered with passion and depth. Under the direction of Anthony Minghella, ""The English Patient"" has resurrected the romantic drama by not dependent on just the direction itself (though Minghella won the Oscar for Best Director) but the clever script by Minghella, undeniable performances with pitch-perfect dialogue, flawless camera work that has sweeping levels of erotica mixed with an emotional connectivity you don't see in a lot of in movies.<br/><br/>Sure it's grandeur in terms of melodramatic intentions, but it does a service to the movie as opposed to just rubbing it into our faces, which makes it effective instead of manipulative. Put in the rightful hands of writer/director Anthony Minghella based on the award-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, Minghella brings the romance between Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) and Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) to life so naturally, it feels like they are living the parts and not just memorizing their lines.<br/><br/>The opening scenes are set in World War II as we see a fighter plane from Great Britain being shot down in the deserts of North Africa. The pilot is a Hungarian Count named Laszlo Almasy (Fiennes) who survived the ordeal, but suffered terrible wounds. We meet Laszlo again in Italy in 1944, his wounds have healed up nicely, but happiness isn't going his way. He is terminally ill and has lapsed into memory loss. A weary Canadian nurse named Hana (Juliette Binoche) escorts Laszlo to a secluded peaceful church to live out his last days. While fueling his veins with morphine and reading volumes from his favourite author Herodotus, Hana is determined to regain Laszlo's memories back. They are not alone in this church as company started coming which includes a mysterious crippled soldier named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who's agenda remains esoteric and two bomb analysts that include British Sgt. Hardy (Kevin Whatley) and his Sikh assistant, Kip (Naveen Andrews) who falls in love with Hana.<br/><br/>The story is executed through a series of flashbacks used effectively, Laszlo starts to make progress in his memories, though Caravaggio believes that Laszlo is not an amnesiac, but just wants to forget what really happened. The story shifts between the present and the events that happened during the 1930's and 1940's when Laszlo was on a map-making mission while on assignment in the Sahara, that was where he meets Katherine Clifton (Scott-Thomas) who's husband (Colin Firth) is part of this initiative. This sets the bar for Laszlo and Katherine to fall head over heals with each other while in the midst of some serious Nazi ruthlessness.<br/><br/>If there was a red herring about ""The English Patient"" is that Laszlo's dying scenes are not as etched out as his flashback sequences. The romantic entanglements between Hana and Kip is way underdeveloped due mostly because they are not fleshed out characters. Therefore, the scenes in the present are really there for filler.<br/><br/>Performance wise Ralph Fiennes was excellent as Laszlo another film that Fiennes likes to challenge himself with and here he's put to the test in a very complex role as a strong, introverted type until the right woman comes along and sweeps him off his feet. Kristin Scott-Thomas shines as Laszlo's love interest as she conveys beauty along with just the right amount of poise and energy that Laszlo finds hard to resist.<br/><br/>Though her role was minimal, Juliette Binoche is still effective in her performance as Hana. William Dafoe adds just the right amount of intensity in his performance like he does in all his movies which he's pretty good at. Rounding out the notable supporting characters are Naveen Andrews as Kip, Colin Firth as Katherine's husband and Julian Wadham as Laszlo's friend Madox.<br/><br/>It's rare to find intelligent epic romantic tales play out so convincingly these days. The thoughts drawn out in this movie will likely have a lingering effect on the viewers once the credits roll. It's one of those films that hits you when you watch it and it hits you once the film ends. This film came right out by award season and rightfully so after spending eight months with bad to mediocre film. This film truly saves the day."
"videorama-759-859391","9","1","1","30 September 2017"," Even the unpatient may like this patient
","People have made jokes about this film, like me. I saw it for the first time last night, in it's entirety. This near two three quarter hour movie, is one you become more engrossed in, the longer you watch. One reason, is to find the catalyst, responsible for a plane that goes down, where survivor Fiennes (yeah, the reputable guy on airlines) a lone author who becomes involved in a fatal affair, that claims beauty, Kristin Scott Thomas, never looking sexier, here. He's working with an archaeologist team, from what I can see, in the wide spanning desert of Cairo, not a place you want to brake down in, Summer or fall, where it's headed by Firth, Kristin Scott's Thomas's husband. The fatal affair intensifies, as we go back and forth with a bed ridden, skinless, Fiennes who has practically lost his face, and other features, burnt beyond recognition (think the sloth victim in Se7en) where he's nursed by army sister, (Binoche, a wonderful actress) who has her eyes on someone else. She plays a quite damned, if a little reserved nurse, whose time and dedication to her patients, where I'm really talking Fiennes here, is much admired. Willem Dafoe plays a bit of a shadowy character, out for revenge against Fiennes, where I could piece the whole following scenario, as experiencing this love triangle in other films, but there's a little bit more to it, which I liked, Dafoe's reasons for his black woolen mitts. Here's a great film, with great actors and characters, especially the ambiguous one of Fiennes, which should be viewed, by those who haven't seen it, even 20 years after it's release. It's ending is sad and memorable, if bleak too, especially if you consider Fienne's fate. Great film, that will stay with you, after seeing it."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","1","16 October 2016"," Love as the existential antithesis of war...
","Adapted from Michael Ondaatje's novel, Anthony Minghella's ""English Patient"" belongs to a Hollywood tradition of war-epics sweeping several Oscars, including the so ""year-defining"" Best Picture, and condemned to inspire such questions as: why did this film win the Best picture over ""Fargo"" or ""Jerry Maguire""? Seriously, the only question that deserves to emerge is: does it matter?<br/><br/>This is a film that is as much about War as say, ""Jerry Maguire"" is about sports, war is incidental to the people's lives but their lives and their relationships are still the real thing. Remember that line from ""Casablanca"": ""it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" All the greatest war movies have contributed to discredit good old Rick; he has a point that on the big scale of war, the global outcome is what really matters but seriously, shouldn't we weep for the people who die on the screen because worse things happen off-screen? People die at war, it's the very essence of war, and if their sacrifice or death allows a few victories on the short term, well, we find the strength to accept the tragedies, but all the acceptance in the world can affect the emotional resonance one's death has on us.<br/><br/>Indeed, what is cinema if not a medium intended to make us care for what goes on, and primarily on the screen? ""Schindler's List"" is incredibly sad because of the innocent lives killed over the course of the Nazi's persecutions and executions, but the story is told in such a way that we're also glad for the survivors who, with the help of Schindler, managed to go through the hellish war. Inversely, in ""Saving Private Ryan"", while we're supposed to cheer for his survival, we can't get quite over the loss of all the soldiers who went looking for him. In war films, we care for people not for wars, if anything, wars teach about humanity more than any other genre and ""The English Patient"" is no exception. <br/><br/>One of the scene that haunted me the most was during a celebration of peace, everyone was chanting, drinking, dancing and cheering, glad to be finally back home and move forward, and then an explosion pooped the party the worst way. One of the officers hanged the British flag on a booby trap and died instantly. Now, this death had upset me more than any other one and the man wasn't even one of the main characters, but I found his death incredibly sad because it happened 'after' the war, as if the bombs should have been magically defused by the power of peace, as if it happened at a moment where no one was supposed to die anymore. It's the unpredictability of death that made it harder to accept, because all through the film, our minds were set to accept people dying. This one, by catching me off guard, revealed to me the essence of war: it makes death more acceptable.<br/><br/>But the power of love is that it can't make death acceptable whether in war or peace time. And in a way, ""The English Patient"" is about deaths that shouldn't have happened if it wasn't for that fateful global conflict. Many people populate the film, and they're never identified by their backgrounds but by the people they love in return, the people they care or cared for, the ones they befriended or been married to. The film is made of two intersected stories, it's about a mysterious aviator (Ralph Fiennes) whose plane has burnt during a secret mission, he is taken care in Italy by a Canadian nurse, Hana, played by Juliette Binoche, who uses a villa as an improvised little hospital. Several men join her, a Sikh bomb expert played by Naveen Andrews and a mysterious man (Willem Dafoe) who seems to have a personal record to settled with the 'English' patient. Their interactions, flashbacks provide enough to make us want more.<br/><br/>The main flashback though is told by the patient, from a time where he was a handsome Hungarian archaeologist, falling in loves with Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) the wife of his friend (Colin Firth). This is not a movie that romanticizes infidelity, their bonding is as a natural and inevitable process as war or a sandstorm, some things you just can't fight back and that seem as efficient in putting people together as separating them. The nurse Hana is also an illustration for this need of love, this is not the Florence Nightingale syndrome, but a need to find someone who can give as much as she gives, and if this person doesn't die in war, that would be enough. Binoche is such a naturally delicate and lovable actress, such a sweet and kind person that if someone like her ever lost the capability to love because of death, the tragedy would be worse than any death.<br/><br/>But that's the secret of ""The English Patient"", by inter-crossing these parallel love and friendship stories, people put their failures into perspective. Even in wars, people don't die completely, their body perish but not their memory, it is a very fitting coincidence that the pre-war period involves map-making, because maps are built on pre-existing territories, you can put any names on them, that doesn't make them exist more. So is love, the memory transcend the actual relationship, it exists as long as you live it, talk about it and let it exist through the memory of other people who'd outlive you. In the film, a solider wants to talk to a man from his town before going, that's what war is about, trying not to completely die. <br/><br/>And despite all the deaths that punctuate the story, at the end, Hana lets a beautiful smile illuminate her face, and it's all in the final revelation about the English Patient."

","The English Patient is proof that films should be judged on merit and content alone, rather than on how the public perceives them. I feel very much the same about this film as I do about How Green Was My Valley; audiences love to trash that film because it beat out Citizen Kane for Best Picture in 1941. Citizen Kane was an astounding movie; so much about knowledge about filmmaking was expressed through that film that directors still use today. Citizen Kane is often touted as the best movie of all time and constantly listed as prominent actor and director's favorite films, providing a source of inspiration. As good as Citizen Kane is, and I agree that it's phenomenal, so is How Green Was My Valley. I have exactly this same kinship to The English Patient. I have heard many people express disdain for this film for a variety of reasons, namely, though, for beating Fargo for best picture in 1996. I have yet to see Fargo, however, The English Patient starring Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, and Kristin Scott Thomas was a sensational film directed by Anthony Minghella, and more than deserving of every award it received from the Academy.<br/><br/>The English Patient opens in 1944 in war-torn Italy. Hanna (Juliette Binoche) is a nurse working in a mobile medical unit who truly puts her heart in her work, yet, unfortunately, watches many of the patients that she grows attached to succumb to their wounds. Traveling along the treacherous land heavily armed with explosives, Hanna volunteers to stay behind in an abandoned church to care for a dying Englishman, Count Laszlo de Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) badly burned, and partially amnesiac. It is just the two of them until a Canadian member of the Intelligence Service arrives. The Canadian, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), is certain he knows who the burned patient is and believes he has cooperated with the Germans. David believes the patient's amnesia is a farce, and rather that he is running from his past. After the accusation, the patient begins to open up about his past and reveal his struggles. A beautiful story of love amongst so much hate begins to unfold and the audience is fortunate enough to be along for the ride.<br/><br/>There are so many wonderful things about this film, I don't even know where to begin. The cinematography in this film is something to treasure. Beautiful shots of desert landscape make wonderful art for the audience to enjoy. The film is scored so subtly and beautifully you nearly forget there's a score until you hear the music at precisely the right time in the film. The storytelling in this film was also exceptionally well-done. I quite enjoy stories told largely through flashbacks. Witnessing the two parallel lives play out on screen was a great experience and added a lot of depth to the film; especially considering how well-done the director accomplished the feat. The pacing and character development were well-executed, keeping the audience engrossed through the final scene. With so many superb aspects of this film, it is a true disappointment that more people don't give The English Patient a viewing.<br/><br/>I reserve the final section of my reviews for audiences I would recommend this film to, but I don't know of anyone that wouldn't gain something from this film. The English Patient was such a remarkable film and doesn't get the credit it deserves so I would love for anyone to watch it at least once. I've plum run out of adjectives to describe how great of an experience this was. I was not expecting to get anything out of this film before I watched it and I am so glad to report that I couldn't have been more wrong. If you're not busy tonight, and you don't mind investing nearly 3 hours, do yourself a favor and watch The English Patient."

","The English Patient is a love story between two people who have no chemistry. The guy is brooding, offensive, socially inept. The gal is cheating on her husband.

","I figured that with a title as pedestrian as The English Patient, it has to be good, right? First off, I thought I was in WWI, not WWII, because they were using bi-planes. The first plane is a Stearman, an American aircraft used only state-side in WWII, for training purposes. <br/><br/>The proper plane to use, for two people, is the British Boulton-Paul Defiant, several of which are still flying. Later, a Dehavilland Tiger Moth (WWI-era) shows up. OK. Forget about the ill-chosen airplanes.<br/><br/>There is a woman in the front (observer) seat of the Stearman when it is hit and downed by German anti-aircraft fire. Who was she? I don't recall anyone mentioning her. OK, forget about the unknown lady who burns to death.<br/><br/>Speaking of burning to death, how did the pilot escape? If the fuel tank was in the front of the airplane, which it apparently was supposed-to-be (I'm not an expert on Stearmans), then he had about ten seconds, at 200 mph, before he is burned alive. Okay. He only suffered some burn to his face. The fire looked rather serious to me.<br/><br/>Next, we have the nurse in the back of a truck, riding alongside a jeep containing her friendly, cheery nurse friend. Her wonderful friend (maybe the only person in the film who we actually like) promptly hits a land-mine and she dies. Why? What purpose does this serve? How is this carnage part of the plot?<br/><br/>Why is the field hospital shelled (by the Germans?)? How does this contribute to our understanding of the story?<br/><br/>Excited yet? Me neither. After her fellow-nurse friend is killed, she decides to basically desert her post and derelict her duties by taking the afore-mentioned, facially-burned pilot to a church that appears abandoned to her. <br/><br/>She was wearing an army helmet (from WWI), so I assume she was an Army nurse. This is desertion. Honorable enough, if we are given a solid reason for her taking this risk and putting herself in such jeopardy for another individual human being. We are given no such reason.<br/><br/>She finds a king-sized bed for him, as well as mosquito netting, food, water and fuel and supplies to cook with. Not bad, for a place on the front lines of battle.<br/><br/>After that, this kooky guy shows up, (played by Willem DaFoe). Let me get this straight: He says he is in the same Canadian Military unit as some people who know her, he is just ""checking up"" on her, and that he ""lives"" nearby? He is also her neighbor in Montreal, Canada? Not very likely.<br/><br/>Once he gets inside the church where the burned guy is, he proceeds to insult the guy who is recovering, questioning his identity. WTF?<br/><br/>After the ""insult the handicapped guy"" scene, we are brought to a somewhat elegant get-together, where (mostly British?) people in formal attire are chatting about their stocks and shares. This is when I turned the movie off. This movie could have excelled had it been done by a small budget, independent, foreign (Italian or French) film maker and a screen-writer who knows how to create compelling and meaningful dialogue. This way, it could have adhered to the plot and intention of the novel."

","This movie has everything from heartbreaking romance and betrayal to mischievous desire and amusement. The cinematography is literally breathtaking. My favourite aspect of this film is how the segues were managed and implemented. The audio and visual overlapping from scene to scene is some of the best art I've witnessed. In my humble opinion, this movie is about the different levels of love and grief, plus the different facets of love and grief. Who can judge true love? How does one cope after the death of a loved one, both literal and emotional? It is also quite clearly a study in prejudice and how we judge a book by its cover more often than not. In the end, it's no wonder this film was given so many accolades. The screenplay adaptation, the direction, the cinematography and the depth of character shown in the lead roles, combined with a sweeping, haunting score make this a definite for my personal top 5 films of all time."
"Seikan","10","3","6","23 April 2006"," The Best Of All Best Picture Winners For Reasons Hidden In Their Poetic Triumphs...
","In a critical scene, as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lies in the Cave Of Swimmers, she writes something read aloud by Hana (Juliette Binoche) in which she proclaims that ""the light has gone out now, and I'm writing in the darkness..."" A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome The English Patient. With such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet, and a strength about the film that doesn't let up, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of World War II, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some independence in the form of Tuscany.<br/><br/>The English Patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful... beautiful final act, and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting, it's the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic even when Count Almásy, from the very start, proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character. Usually typecast as a villain, he shows tainted, but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill.<br/><br/>Many will criticize this film based on its so called ""glorification of adulterers"", but those who do know nothing. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the start) are spectacular, as the patient is the regretting man who suffers because of what he did, the evil that was once in him now absent, whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else. He wants this woman but he cannot have her, Fiennes brings the human-like qualities out of Almásy in a way absolutely NO OTHER actor could. There couldn't have been a better actor for the job.<br/><br/>So please, take these comments to heart, see the film, those who call it ""boring"" or ""despicable"" know nothing, and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view on the film, a view that they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably don't plan on correcting. The English Patient is the best of every film to have ever won the Best Picture Oscar, and for so many reasons, hidden in their poetic triumphs."

","The English Patient reminds me of a modern day ""Casablanca"" in that it accurately portrayed the intense personal conflicts of World War II.<br/><br/>I like the line ""I do this because I am a nurse.""<br/><br/>This is a great movie and reveals the absolute madness of war and the struggle for humanity during military conflicts.<br/><br/>I also liked the way the story weaved in and out between flashbacks and the present. <br/><br/>The beginning with the art drawn on a cave wall reminds me of the scene in ""American Beauty"" when the leaves were dancing on the street- very artistic and classy.<br/><br/>It is also very interesting to me that the concept of ""ownership"" in a relationship shifted from the theoretical to the practical, in that once lovers become emotionally attached to each other, they expect more from each other and need a feeling of belonging and being ""special."""
"philip_vanderveken","7","3","6","18 July 2005"," Not as perfect as I hoped it would be, but certainly enjoyable
","I don't really know why, but it has taken almost 10 years before I finally watched this movie. I guess this happened because I just didn't have the time for it, although I must admit that I didn't really want to make the time for it either. I'm a fan of war movies and I knew very well that this was one too, but the fact that it isn't one in the most strict sense of the word somewhat scared me off. But only a couple of days ago I saw a similar movie, ""The End of the Affair"", which was also situated in that time period, which didn't exactly show the war either and which also featured Ralph Fiennes. I really liked that movie a lot and for me that was enough reason to finally give this film a try.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" starts at the end of WWII when an unknown and dying man, who doesn't remember anything of what has happened to him or who he is, is treated in a military hospital for severe burning wounds. When his situation is somewhat stable, he and a lot of other patients are being moved by truck to another hospital. But when a car in the column of trucks drives on a mine, somewhere in the middle of the Italian countryside, the whole expeditions stops until the road is cleared from mines. The Canadian nurse who takes care of the unknown man, finds an empty and old monastery and decides that she will stay there with him until the man dies. She soon wins his confidence and that's how it almost immediately gets clear that the man knows a lot more about his past than what he wanted to admit to his interrogators. Through flash backs we get to know that he is an Hungarian who was employed by the Royal Geographical Society as a map maker in the 1930's. He had to chart the vast expanses of the Sahara Desert with several other prominent explorers. Gradually the riddles of the past are unraveled and his role in the war is getting more obvious...<br/><br/>Somehow I was a bit disappointed by this movie. It was far from bad, but it wasn't exactly what I hoped it would be. Somewhere I missed something in it, although I find it very hard to say what that exactly was. I guess the best way to describe this feeling is by saying that, because of the continuous switching between present and flash back, I wasn't completely sucked into the story this time. It broke all continuity in the story and that did bother me a bit too often. But don't get me wrong, this is still a movie that is far above average and worth watching for several reasons. One of those reasons is the acting. Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Kristin Scott Thomas,... They are all very fine actors who I liked in almost every movie that I watched them play in and this movie wasn't an exception to that rule. Perhaps they aren't very well known to the average viewer who only watches commercial Hollywood toppers, but people who also like more 'alternative' movies, will certainly know their names. But next to the fine acting, this movie also offers some great scenes and images. I like the way they shot the Sahara with its sand storms and sand dunes, but I also enjoyed the images of the Italian countryside. I truly believe that those images added a lot to the value of this movie and its story, which was also more than OK of course.<br/><br/>All in all this is a movie that may not be as perfect as I hoped it would be, but that still offered me a good time while watching it. I wouldn't recommend it to the people who only like war movies when there are some big fight scenes to be seen in it, because they will be very disappointed, but when you like a more alternative war movie so now and then, than this might be a good movie to watch. I give it a rating in between a 7/10 and a 7/5.10."

","Reading one reviewer's comments about not liking the English Patient, I feel I have to respond. This is my all-time favorite movie. But I admit it's a matter of taste. I think World War II is the most fascinating period of modern history. Great upheaval in all parts of the world. The three globally dominate political systems clashing in a conflict that reshaped the world into the one we live in today. Most World War II movies are about great clashes on the battlefields. But in this movie they are a mere backdrop to one of the most romantic tales ever told, in my opinion. I am an incredible romanticist, and you have to be to like this movie. It also helps that I am the product of parents whose lives were shaped by World War II. My father fought the Germans and spent years in one of their prisoner of war camps. World War II was the dominant theme in our household growing up. I believe the makers of this movie did a great job of capturing the scale of World War II without putting us through endless battle scenes, like Saving Private Ryan. But most of all they captured the torture of a burning romance torn asunder by forces these lovers could not control. Although the English Patient and Casablanca are very different films, the themes are similar."

","After browsing through numerous reviews from guys who wouldn't know a great movie if it came up and slapped them (and from reading their reviews I am guessing their idea of a perfect movie would be Gator Bait III) I feel compelled to put my two cents worth in on this film. The 1996 Oscars were important, in that for the following two years, the Academy ignored what should have won Best Picture in 97 and 98 - so the win by The English Patient was proof that Hollywood at that point could still recognize great film making when they saw it.<br/><br/>The movie had some of the best music, cinematography, and acting with sublime direction by Minghella that brought out the true essence of what Ondjaate was trying to convey in the novel. For people to complain that the film was overly long is ludicrous. Clocking in at just under 2hrs 45, this film is shorter than Harry Potter 1, Dances with Wolves, Titanic, and others, and in the time allotted on screen, it manages to evoke an emotional reaction from its audience that most other movies of its genre strive to do, but ultimately fail. <br/><br/>The evolution of the character arcs, especially Almasy and Katherine is incredible *SPOILER WARNING* culminating in him finally admitting his love for her as he carries her to the caves *SPOILER OVER* That scene ALWAYS makes me cry for some reason....Probably the sheer tragedy of the situation wherein they both know there is no future for them, but that the emotion and affection they both subconsciously knew was there was finally realized.<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant piece of film, and a movie that should be on any true movie lover's DVD shelf. Of course, if you're in the minority of the people on this board who don't like ""Chick Flicks"" or ""Long and boring movies"" then you should probably avoid this. If you, like myself, enjoy a masterfully directed piece of cinema that doesn't rely on heavy CGI, explosions, gunfire, foul language and frat parties, then if you haven't had a chance to see The English Patient, I would recommend renting a copy of the newly released Collector's Edition DVD and see what all the fuss is about."

But Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas are hardly less magnificent. The film gives proof of the potential aesthetic and emotional power at the disposal of contemporary film-makers, and it makes full use of it. The final quarter of an hour puts this film in the category of the greatest of all time...such is the sublimity of direction, editing, acting, music, structure...But is it the greatest film ever? Reservations have to be expressed; moral ones for instance; the lead characters are hardly admirable, even if they are eminently pitiable.

Anthony Minghella beautifully translates Michael Ondaatje's superb novel into an equally superb film. >From the opening credits ""The English Patient"" intrigues the viewer,as it reveals only what is necessary for each scene. The scant dialogue, and sweeping cinematography play beautifully off one another. Director Saul Zaentz gives marvelous direction. The cast performs brilliantly, giving each character a life force of his/her own. The chemistry is palpable and believable. With each subtle nuance life is breathed into the characters as they actually become multi-dimensional, real, flawed human beings. Upon viewing this film for the first time, I left the theater feeling as completely disoriented as if I had exited a time machine and found myself completely and utterly absorbed with the characters for months afterward."

","There are few films in existence that can take a viewer to such a vast wasteland of stupor and boredom, and then coax him to wander through the three hour long journey. Thank the good Lord I only had to watch it once because if I had to endure such a pointless plot for a second time, well I just don't think I could take it-let me elaborate. The English Patient begins with the amazing avion shots of a battered english Tiger Moth flying high over the rippling dunes of Africa. He's got some babe wrapped up in a parachute in the front seat(Tiger Moth's had a pilots seat in the rear.)Guess what happens next? Bam! He's shot out of the sky and burnt all up to a crisp. Right about then I said to myself,""Who cares?"" This pathetic story of a burnt up man lags for hours, each second you feel that there may be a point- a point that never comes! You find out that you dont even like the main characters and that you'd just as well have them die earlier in the movie. This movie sucked from start to finish and needless to say is one of my favorite movies of all time."

"ripplesofserenity","8","2","4","20 March 2010"," An epic of life, death, love, sensuality and war.
","The English Patient grabbed nine Oscars (including the Best Picture), along with three other nominations in 1997. Need I say more that this is a must watch. A word of caution this is not your regular movie; it is slow, steady, poetic and slightly on the classical side (if you get my drift).<br/><br/>The movie open with an aircraft shot down somewhere in Sahara Desert. The pilot, Count Laszlo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), survives with some serious burns and very little recollection of the past, and is rescued by a Bedouin. Turned over to the Canadian medical unit stationed in Italy, with nothing to go on (due to serious burns and amnesia) he is named ""English Patient"".<br/><br/>Hana (Juliette Binoche), a nurse in the unit takes care of him. Realizing that ""English Patient"" is slowly dying, Hana manages to persuade here superior to care for him alone in an abandoned villa, until he succumbs to inevitable.<br/><br/>It is not too late they are accompanied by- a mysterious, crippled war veteran named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who has a hidden agenda, and a pair of bomb experts, the British Sgt. Hardy (Kevin Whately) and his Sikh superior, Kip (Naveen Andrews).<br/><br/>The storyline swings to-and-fro between past and present, through dreams and waking flashbacks as Laszlo's memory slowly return. Constant flip-flops between late-'30s and early- '40s, reveal Laszlo to be a part of a British map-making effort of Sahara under the banner of Royal Geographical Society. It's then that he meets Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas), the wife of a fellow pilot (Colin Firth) who is helping with the project. Laszlo and Katharine fall for each other, and so to forbidden tale of love starts.<br/><br/>It sure throbs of melodrama; I would rather like to call it classical. In its defence, it is a well-crafted story brought to screen with great care by British playwright and director Anthony Minghella and based on the prize-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, that serves up the love of Almasy and Katharinein a way that is simultaneously epic and intimate.<br/><br/>The one flaw in The English Patient- The ""modern-day"" scenes with Almasy awaiting death aren't as nearly as involving as the flashback sequences. Characters of Hana and Kip aren't fully-realized, though they are on sideline, the scenes that take place in this time frame, some of which are quite lengthy, seem unwanted interruptions.<br/><br/>The English Patient is an epic of life, death, love, sensuality and war. It is heartbreakingly poetic, wonderfully directed, keen importance to detail, and contrast of pain and pleasure. It is a sort of love story that seem rare these days."

","I have heard an awful lot about 'The English Patient' and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what all the ballyhoo was about. What I found out was a cinematic delight and should, I repeat 'should' always be watched with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral zealot, I am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. As I remember correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who I quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got'. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. <br/><br/>I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film. I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. It's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. Its set in the world war II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war torn Italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended. Watch it with someone you truly love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! Why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence. <br/><br/>Anyway it deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director Anthony Minghella.It kind of brings back the romanticism in the David Lean genre of films.It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing folks."

I never do this in a movie unless it's really bad. I had brought some jelly beans in for a snack and before I fell asleep was combining different flavours together to make new flavours.That's how bored I was.As far as I can remember this won an Academy award.

"cbaumert","Null","2","4","26 June 2004"," Even with intelligent directing, a failed conversion
","After having read a novel focused so completely on imagery and sensory detail, my first reaction might also be to desperately desire to see it in a performance worthy of reality.  But it is folly to believe that the written version of 'The English Patient' can ever conceivably be adapted to film, that its characters can ever be personified, or that its emotional tension can ever be imitated.<br/><br/>Anthony Minghella and the film's production crew do a sufficient and even commendable job piecing together the skeletal necessities of the extramarital romance between Almasy and Katharine, and I was almost extremely impressed that all the novel's most poignant emotional moments and scenes defining the most important aspects of each character were included in this film adaptation; however, the literary work is so well written that it would be impossible to have a movie without them.  Even the medicine man in the desert encased in his jacket of glass bottles and ground peacock bone makes his necessary appearance, further proving that this film was produced solely for a bibliophile's wish to share the daydreams in his head.<br/><br/>'The English Patient' in book form is a study in the mind's capacity to appreciate the physical world around it; the mind of the film-going audience member can't participate in this study, as subtle emotional intensity and incredible imagery are force-fed to the audience and shackled to an immobile plot line.  Chronological sense and order is created out of a confused amalgamation of anecdotes and memories trapped inside the dying mind of the English patient, and causes some otherwise good acting performances to go to waste.<br/><br/>The worst tragedy of the creation of the film is the omission of much of the relationship between the Sikh and Hana, the young Canadian nurse in need of some humanity other than the grim realities of war.  The relationship does not begin with much fanfare, and ends with even less, the Sikh riding off with a neutral smile.  The film glosses over the Sikh's history as a sapper and leaves out any mention of the dropping of the atomic bomb, an event that further separates the Western from the Eastern world and causes Kip, the Sikh, to ride off and leave everything Western, his disarming equipment and his affection for Hana, behind in Italy.<br/><br/>Minghella directs his actors with flair and intelligence, but in the end, the film is really a bland, more structural version of Michael Ondaatje's book."

"vegan x","7","2","4","2 August 1999"," Mixed Sentiment
","For fans of a love story, The English Patient fits the bill. As a movie, it is masterfully crafted from all angles: the direction and cinematography are flawless, as are the performances of Fiennes, Thomas, Binoche and the rest of the cast. The relationship portrayed by Fiennes and Thomas is passionate and enthralling, and as a fan of Ralph Fiennes for some time, I must say that this is probably his most awe-inspiring showing yet.<br/><br/>What detracts from this film, unfortunately, is its lack of originality. The typical love story is thankfully elevated by the actors' performances, as well as a wonderfully inventive script. However, I feel that for such a long movie, more time should have been spent developing the main plot (namely, the trials and love of the young count) and less on subplots. Of particular note is the relationship between the nurse and Kip, which I found only confused the meaning of the original storyline.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say a well-performed and orchestrated love story, although I am glad that I did not spend $7.50 on it."
"tone-12","Null","2","4","2 March 1999"," Incoherent Story!
","I found this film boring and pretentious. The director is trying to con the viewer into believing that we are witnessing a ""great love story"". But it is a love story involving one-dimensional, cardboard cut-out characters acting within a plot that is totally incoherent and impossible to follow.<br/><br/>Some elements of the plot were just plain ridiculous. Why were they flying around in a civilian aircraft in the middle of the North African battle zone? And why was the English patient still being carted around Italy years after he was injured in North Africa? The film made no attempt to clarify these plot elements. Yet it still expected us to be moved by the ""great love story"". What a nerve!"
"Jodie-4","Null","2","4","23 February 1999"," A disappointment
","I entered this film expecting a work of genius, so perhaps one of the reasons I found it mediocre was that I had such high expectations of it. However, my problem with the film goes beyond its length, it relates more closely to the way the characters in the film were developed. Anyone who's read the book knows that ""The English Patient"" has little to do with the actual English patient, and more to do with Hana, the French Canadian nurse attempting to recuperate from the war. It is in her relationships with the people surrounding her that is the true heart of the story, but Hana's character was left sadly unexplored in this film. The importance of her relationship with Kip (and Kip's character) suffered most greatly in the translation from the page onto film, and it was a shame that the audience lost much of the original point of the story."

Almasy will do anything for the love of Katherine; borders, enemies - none of that is important - only the woman he loves. Is that moral? Is it honorable? Those questions pervade this movie.

"trojanrabbit97","8","2","4","11 March 2001"," Pleasantly Surprised
","My biggest film-buff friends didn't like this movie, so it took me nearly five years to get around to seeing it.  I'm very glad that I finally did see it.  Expert cinematography, carefully-handled subplots, and rock-solid acting make this film a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>The movie is slow, but I didn't find it boring.  This is basically a frame story told in flashbacks.  Be careful when watching this movie to note the dates of the various flashbacks, because they're not all in sequential order; however, I found that they were masterfully interwoven.<br/><br/>The primary love story didn't really pull at my heartstrings at first, but I frequently have to make an effort to set aside personal judgmentalism for a story about an adulterous relationship.  It's easier for me when the betrayed spouse is blatantly evil or a big jerk, like Lord Wessex of ""Shakespeare in Love"" (Poor Firth... his female's always falling for a Fiennes) or the Thief of ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover."" While Clifton may not have been a perfect husband, he genuinely loved his wife.  Near the end of the movie, when Almasy and Katherine go back to the cave, (I'm trying to avoid a spoiler here) is when their love story really seizes my heart.  It was around this point in the film that I began to realize what all the hype was about and see the genius of this film.  I think the last 30 to 45 minutes are the best part of the movie and well worth the wait. This film was definitely worthy of its 1996 Best Picture nomination.  Did it deserve to win?  I haven't seen its competitors recently enough to offer an informed opinion, but I don't think the '96 Oscars upset the order and balance of the universe."

","I've honestly tried to like Ondaatje's works; they seem like they'd make great reading, especially the one about Jesse James. But he's not to my taste, not at all. I'm not able to appreciate his greatness, and I'm sorry to be so limited.  Given that, it's not surprising that I wondered if Minghella could make much of ""The English Patient."" Did he ever! Yes, there are many fine, better than fine, acting performances (Naveen Andrews, especially), astonishing cinematography. But Minghella worked the alchemy here, made a lively story, cut away much from what was already a fairly short work, more a novella than a novel -- and created what seemed like a vast saga, spanning centuries -- crossing continents -- and gave us a story of forgiveness, of the terrors and wonders of both hate and love, but most typically -- a story of humanity transcending nationality, again and again. We may embrace across all sorts of borders, even hatred -- and better ourselves doing so. This embrace transcends time and death and culture. A master work."

","The first time I saw TEP was in a cold winter day in Quebec, and when I left the theater I felf I wanted to cry. Yes, because during 2 and half hours I was very far away from that city and submerged in a beautiful world of passions, tragedies and love. The English Patient became my favorite movie ever, because it took me to places in time and space in a way no movie had before. Every character in this movie is complex and human, they mirror life and how some events can change our life forever. What I like most of these movie is how elegantly made it is, and how technically perfect is too. I've seen this movie a good 20 times,and every time I see it I discover new things in it, different motivations for it's characters new small hidden sounds to make a scene perfect. I can say that the relationship between The Count and Katherine is a very despicable one, they are selfish and impulsive, but again that's what we, the public like the most: Big passions, irresistibles ones. I love this movie too because it's a nostalgic trip,everybody here wants to go back to their formal self. Hanna,The Count, Caravaggio, Kip even Katherine, and sometimes in real life there's is this need to go back, to be how we were before. Besides, the music is one of the most inspiring ones i've ever heard in a film, blending beautifully with extremely perfect shots of the desert and of The Villa. The acting is subtle and controlled, just with small gestures Kristin S. Thomas commands the scenes she's in. Since this movie I want to see every movie with her. I recommend this movie to everybody who has ever wanted to go back in time so badly that it hurts. The perfect movie for the real romantics."

","Not much point adding to the praise already heaped on this movie.  I've read through a number of critiques and it seems that many are of the same opinions about this glorious film.  I was surprised to see a few negative points made though.  Two of which I'd like to address.<br/><br/>'We disliked the film because I didnt like any of the characters' - or variations on this.  - This was an odd criticism I thought to make about a movie.  I don't think that I liked the main characters very much myself. Selfish people who pursued their passion at the expense of all others.  But for me, it was this that elevated the film to greatness since despite my feelings towards the lovers, I was still shattered by the ending.  I'm not sure you can criticise a movie because you don't like the characters portrayed within.  Seems a bit unfair.  This film just doesn't make any compromises to the modern taste.  The characters were honest ones, beautifully played and I didnt have to 'like' them.  <br/><br/>The second class of comments I reacted to here were along the lines of - 'It was boring and tedious - nothing happens'.  This is so much more a reflection of the reviewer than of the film that I'm quite glad to see these comments here.  There are certain items of intellectual equipment that you need to appreciate this film, and sadly not everyone has them.  Perhaps not everyone wants them of course (certainly not governments!).  99/100 films are made for the lowest common denominator - (with the money to go to the cinema that is!).  Every so often, you get a film that requires the audience to 'think' and to have attention spans of more than the length of a Cola add.<br/><br/>One of the greatest movies of all time."

"sanabuttniazi","10","0","0","22 May 2020"," One of my favourite films, will never understand the hate.
","The cinematography is gorgeous, every shot looks like a painting. The score is understated and haunting and Marta Sebestyen's rendition of Sezerelem is just beautiful. The script was very well written, it felt poetic yet very natural. The story is incredibly layered and subtle, I have watched it a number of times now and I always notice something new. The scenes and character arcs in North Africa and Italy parallel each other very well.
One common complaint I have heard about this film is that the characters are unlikeable. I didn't really think so. Almassy's surly persona feels like a front. He likes to imagine himself to be a rational and practical man, hence the whole writing papers without using any adjectives nonsense, but in reality he is hot headed, impulsive and passionate, and this aspect of himself comes out when he falls for a woman who is very similar in this regard. Their self absorption is ultimately their downfall. He feels like a much warmer person in the scenes in Italy, as though his ordeal has humbled him somewhat and taught him to pay more attention to those around him, he takes interest in Hannah's affairs in a way he neglected to when he was with the likes of Maddox.
Katherine's relationship with her husband is a complex one. She loves him as a friend and Almassy as a lover. ""Romantic Love and Platonic Love are quite different things"". She does not wish to hurt him, but as Clifton mentions in an obliviously triumphant way, she has basically settled for a man who she has always viewed as a friend and she ends up breaking his heart when she meets a man that she actually has feelings for. It's a good cautionary tale for ""nice guys"" who are desperate to get out of the friend zone. Clifton makes every attempt to put her on display and tempt fate by leaving her alone in the desert with Almassy, in spite of his protestations, so I can only feel so sorry for him, her wondering off was inevitable given the circumstances.
Another common complaint is that his switching allegiance to the Nazis, being justified by Love was dodgy. Put yourself in his shoes. Imagine the one person you care about in all the world is slowly dying a painful death in the middle of nowhere, you've been walking for days looking for help, when you finally find the ""good guys"" in the war, they treat you like dirt mock your name and arrest you and cart you away, and all the while your beloved is left to die, they've effectively murdered that person through their ignorance. Are you seriously telling me you'd be noble and put the war effort first if you'd been through all that? Most normal people are not that self sacrificing, almost everyone would do the same thing in the circumstances, especially if they were desperate and still thought that they had a chance of saving their loved one.
Most of the complaints levelled at this film are not in my opinion justified and are mostly the result of people not paying attention to the film.
And if you think that anything that's unabashedly romantic is soppy, then that's just your problem."

Over 2hrs 40min this epic slowly unfurls, revealing to us the intricate histories of a swath of characters expertly portrayed. The relationship between Thomas and Fiennes is intense, highly involved, and utterly believable. Juliette Binoche's crisp performance of Hana is layered with a youth and naivety. And the leering and shady Caravaggio was played by Dafoe lends an edge to the story that helps propel the narrative.<br/><br/>Rare is its that a movie succeeds in capturing a place, a time and the raw and untranslated emotions of such a diverse palate of characters. But it must be said, this is not a thrilling adventure movie, nor a electrifying tale of spies ladened with plot twists and turns, but a slow exploration of human character, and the relationships that grow between people, despite their surrounds and origins. War is present, but it's ever in the background, as much as the desert is, or the green hills above Florence, where Hana sets up her impromptu hospice.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is a wonder, maybe even witnessed here in the performance of his career as he plays what is ultimately two roles: the spirited and driven Almasy, at his prime and in his comfort in the solitary confines of North Africa, and the English Patient, withered and injured as he lays, accepting death and musing in his last hours of the love he once felt.<br/><br/>For fans of he book this movie pales in comparison, but that only goes to show the mastery of Ondaatje's writing. The characters appear as washed out versions of themselves, with the role of Hana proving to be most removed from her literary self. Soft changes to the history and build up of the story also prove subtle alterations to the relationship between characters.But that is not to take away from the wonder of this movie. Winner of 9 occurs and nominated for a further three, this is a film that will remain a classic in the years to come. A movie that is an utter joy to watch for the first time, and has that uncommon touch of magic that can be relived again and again over future viewings."

","Early in the film the subjects of adjectives comes up between the two people who begin the first romance in this film. The film then proceeds to demonstrate the many kinds of love a person may encounter. It matters not their wants, but what befalls them takes control. The adjectives mount up as their lives collide on courses they never dreamed of following. Romantic, lustful and enduring are some of the ""adjectives"" that engulf them . Intense joy, hate and pain are the emotions these passions bring out. Sometimes the price is high, but with no regrets.<br/><br/>The background is set just prior and through World War II. It is both a enemy and an ally to these lover's passions, but it has no strength against these passions. It enforces them.<br/><br/>I have not read the novel, but script is superb. The characters are strong and you will see them grow as they navigate the mania of their desires. I will defend the indulgence of adjectives because that is the theme of this film and of my review.<br/><br/>The script uses what is called flashbacks, but they seem more like dreams. The settings and the visual effects give these flashbacks this dreamlike quality.<br/><br/>The settings switch from the vast expanse of the deserts of North Africa to a darkened interior of an enclosed truck cab. Sometimes in bright sunlight and then in the firelight of candles and campfires.<br/><br/>The action is sharp and sudden. Not prolonged. It is meant to have an effect on the story and not be overwhelming. The performance of the cast is spot on.<br/><br/>I would suggest watching this more. I know I needed to, so I could absorb all the detail this film has to offer.<br/><br/>Enjoy"

","This winner of nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, is truly an epic. It stars Ralph Fiennes, Kristen Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, and Colin Firth. The plot centers around Fiennes's character, Count Laszlo, falling in love with a married woman, Katherine, played by Thomas. All of this story is told in flashbacks. An older, dying Count Laszlo is being cared for by a war nurse, played by Binoche, who gives a fine performance. Binoche gives the strongest performance of all, earning her an academy award. The script is emotional, touching, and emphasizes the connections between the characters involved. I loved the chemistry between Thomas and Fiennes, it is a wonderful love story to watch. Also, the connection that Hana and Laszlo share is something very special. Love is at the center of this entire film, and it will touch you in a deep way, or at least that's the experience I had with it. I suggest this very well made film to those who like epics. It is not the best film ever, but it is certainly a very good one. 8/10 for The English Patient."

","""The English Patient"" has long been transformed into one of the most classic films of romantic cinema, but it seems that the public has had little appreciation or patience for romantic movies, particularly if they are very long and slow. Based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje (which I have), its located in Italy at the end of World War II, telling the story of a military nurse being in a ruined house to assist an aviator who was terribly injured in a plane crash. So, this movie was intended for a public that wants to follow the story, savor all moments, follow the emotions of the characters. The script makes a good adaptation of the book. Scenarios and costumes have been thought through to detail and the period elements have been well recreated and are historically suitable. Visually, the film is excellent: great cinematography, with Italian and North African landscapes dazzling the audience. Ralph Fiennes was excellent in the lead role, achieving one of the most remarkable works of his career. Juliette Binoche was not as surprising as him, but she was well in her role. To be fair, the only problem in this film is the overly slow pace, making it overly sentimental in some scenes. I understand the idea and the intention behind, but everything has its limits and even honey can make you sick."

","Twenty years on this film shows no sign of aging, undoubtedly helped by its historical setting (as we know, nothing dates faster than clothing and interiors). I think it gets nearly everything right. The cast is magnificent, the narrative approach highly effective, the cinematography and direction outstanding. The script is so intelligent - much could be said about the multiple examples of symmetry and contrast, between individuals, present and past, circumstances etc. One reason all the cast deliver such terrific performances is that they are given wonderful material to work with, as characters they are all fully fleshed out and convincing. To me it bears comparison with the epics of David Lean. I only have two criticisms and neither amounts to much. One is that, OK, it is sentimental, but I don't find it excessively so. The later cave of swimmers scenes are so moving! I love them. The second criticism is that there are various implausibilities, like Fiennes being able to make his way from a train track in the middle of nowhere to the place where the plane is held. And I don't think the characters would bump into each other quite as much as they do. Minor quibbles when you think of the sweep and scale of the movie, the intelligence, the warmth of the relationships and the immaculate use of the African and Italian settings."

","The English Patient (1996): Dir: Anthony Minghella / Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willen Dafoe, Kristen Scott Thomas, Naveen Andrews: Beautiful photography and tremendous production accompany a story of the hardship we often inflict upon ourselves just as the title character is guilty of his own consequential pain. Ralph Fiennes is the English patient and he is heavily sedated in makeup to portray his injury. He was involved in a plane crash and is now under the care of a nurse played by Juliette Binoche. Through flashbacks we witness his affair with Kirsten Scott Thomas and their travels through a windy desert. Spellbinding plot with crucial developments at each flashback, as well as a romance blossoming in the present time. Director Anthony Minghella gradually reveals new information while creating one of his best films. Fiennes is convicting as he reflects on decisions that are answered in tragedy. Binoche is full of life as she connects and finds love in a man leaving Fiennes only to envy. She is romanced by a bomb disposal officer played passionately by Naveen Andrews. Thomas symbolizes the dangers of lust while Willem Dafoe appears as a reflection of torture and pain. This is a great film full of expression and stunning production.

","This movie is another romance with the background of World War II. But instead of being caged up in a single location, the story sets back and forth nicely between the past in Northern African desert, and the present story perspective of Italy. Though based on a not so exemplary premise of unfaithfulness the romance stirs up well enough, with the help of the alternating story flow. The mood is very nicely kept to a minimum tension. Despite being based on World War II, and having many opportunities which can have the mood rise up, the movie manages to keep out to a minimum by imploring anti-climaxes here and there. On the acting side, this movie presents us with one of the great works by Ralph Fiennes. Juliet Binoche, Willem Dafoe and Colin Firth also bring out high quality acting on their respective parts. This is truly a nice entertainment worth a watch for me."
"anthonyehler","8","0","0","3 June 2014"," Hearts of Fire
","English Patient<br/><br/>Hearts of Fire<br/><br/>Laszlo Almasy (Fiennes), Hungarian aristocrat and respected explorer is part of the International Sand Club before World War II. During a desert exploration, he meets Katherine (Scott-Thomas), a whole-hearted adventurer, and falls in love – even though she is married to Geoffrey (Firth), a British patriot. When we first see Almasy, he is badly burnt in a plane crash. A self-sacrificing French-Canadian nurse, Hana (Binoche) takes him to a war-shredded monastery to live out his last weeks. Hana is joined at the villa by Kip (Andrews), a Sikh bomb-disposal expert and a bitter ex-spy turned thief and addict called Caravaggio (Dafoe). The patient's story, told in flashbacks, forms the nucleus of this sweeping romance.<br/><br/>The English Patient is unusual in that both its main narrative and subplot are love stories informed by the displacement of war. The love affair between Almasy and Katherine is a classic triangle, a story of forbidden love against the tumult of changing history. Almasy says he doesn't like to possessed, but soon he is possessed by his need for Katherine: he becomes jealous, violent, mad. He says the heart is 'an organ of fire' – and he is consumed by a fire out of control. And Geoffrey's act of desperation is a catalyst for the film's final tragedy.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Hana's love affair with Kip is far more naturalistic, tender and explorative. It explores beauty and trust. Ultimately, it is about healing, and cultures coming together. Whereas Almasy is betrayed by his Hungarian past by the suspicious English, Hana and Kip are examples of the hope for a multi-cultural world after the war. It is an idealistic statement to be sure, but a powerful one nonetheless.<br/><br/>The script very cleverly brings Hana into Almasy's storyline by giving Katherine's poignant last letter to Almasy a voice, and giving her the power to release the burnt Almasy from his suffering. <br/><br/>Hana is a wonderfully empathetic hinge between the two stories, between past and present. In this regard, she is probably the most important character in the film.<br/><br/>Director Anthony Minghella has infused every frame of the movie with light and dark, colour and shadow. The stark gold of the North African desert is juxtaposed against the soft dappled green-and-blue summer of Italy. <br/><br/>Two scenes stand out: Almasy and the team exploring the Cave of Swimmers against Hana and Kip exploring the Italian church. Both illuminate something hidden, hitherto unseen, mysterious and beautiful. Both become exquisite and lavish metaphors for the human condition. The light plays a part in delineating the two love stories. In the ACT II climax, Katherine is left alone in a cave with dying torch light as Almasy is dragged through a dark tunnel, a captive in a British Jeep: so symbolic of death.<br/><br/>The film explores many themes on many levels. One that is the most powerful is the idea of personal history against landscape, biography, war – between one man's memory and another's idea of truth, romantic myth and appalling reality. <br/><br/>Almasy's book is by Herodotus, the father of history. The idea of storytelling is a powerful thread through the film: from the campfire stories in the desert, to the folk song, to the letters and notes we find inside his well-worn book. In the end, Hana – the most hopeful, kind and idealistic character – carries this book and this part of history into the future."

As far as we could tell, it was another case of using some historical event as the context for a love story (around the time when we saw it, ""Titanic"" was in the theaters, so that was eating at us a little). The story has Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse, helping surplice crash victim Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) in North Africa during WWII. Also with them is a man named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe).<br/><br/>Granted, ""The English Patient"" wasn't an awful movie. It did look at WWII and how that was affecting various people. But the whole thing seemed a little overblown; the scene that really caught my eye was when Hana took a bath in the fountain.

Also, it is probably the most sordid movie I can ever remember seeing.<br/><br/>However, this movie WAS well-made (in a technical sense).

Sure, it's well-made, but it's not very original. Artists have to fight hard for romances to be original, and this movie just didn't fight hard enough. The characters, while well-portrayed, aren't the kind you remember for the rest of your life. It's the kind of movie you rent and enjoy for a time or two. For movie makers and storywriters, it can also give you some general (but not specific) inspiration. But then you move on, and this movie is forgotten.<br/><br/>My suggestion? See above.

","This is just Catch-22 with romance and gorgeous scenery. Like Yossarian, Almasy sees the great sacred cow of World War Two as simply an intrusion on his individual happiness and a threat to his personal well being.<br/><br/>When Caravaggio tells Almasy that thousands of people had died because he helped the Germans, Almasy replies ""thousands of other people would have died if I hadn't."" Whether the deaths were Allied or Axis is morally neutral to him, compared to his need to recover the body of his dead lover. We are meant to sympathize with his romantic loyalty and political indifference.<br/><br/>Almasy is presented as an exile without country or politics, whose only homeland is his pocket Herodotus. (The historical Almasy was actually a Hungarian officer serving in the Luftwaffe and assigned to Rommel's headquarters, but that's just dramatic license.) Katherine is an instinctive Little Englander who longs to leave Egypt for a garden in Dorsetshire; she loves neither her husband nor the imperial project in which he is deeply involved. The romance between Hana and Kip is equally anti-political. She is a French Canadian, he a Sikh, both members of subject peoples serving a British Empire in which they have no stake, and they drop out of the war to make a private space for themselves.<br/><br/>English Patient is the anti-Casablanca. It's perspective is that the problems of two little people are the only thing that amounts to a hill of beans in this crazy world, and that the intrusions of history, politics and war are simply a curse. E.M. Forester wrote that if he had to choose between betraying his friend and betraying his country, he hoped he'd have the guts to betray his country. The movie says ""Amen."""

","Not only judging from the numerous Oscar awards (which I experienced to be sometimes misleading earlier) but also from the emphatic praises of some independent critics, I placed high expectations on this movie: It promised to present an intense, epic story on the a historical background of world war II, a story that centers around a passionate love, touching the viewer with the depth of a tragic romance. <br/><br/>But what a disappointment! The movie is flawed in so many ways. The slow pace that is criticized by a lot of viewers is not part of the problem itself. It would have been appropriate for this kind of story if the script writer and the director had explored the characters and their motivations more deeply and more convincingly. Unfortunately the movie remains on the surface. Moreover,the way that many elements of the plot come in makes them unbelievable, as if they were constructed only to support the overall story line.<br/><br/>The worst of all is - from my point of view - that the movie is unable to present the central romance between Laszlo and Katharine as anything deeper than an affair which is based on simple erotic attraction only. If it were meant in this way, I had no problem with it: Affairs that remain on this level are probably frequent in reality. However this movie tries hard to convince us of more. And it fails miserably.<br/><br/>It looks as if the film makers took some ingredients to produce a romantic atmosphere (diaries, candle lights, sunsets etc.) from an average TV soap, mixed everything together and hoped to come out with a romance in this simple way. <br/><br/>Proceeding in this way, the potential of the story for many highly dramatic moments was thrown away. There is at least one scene that would have made me cry in the context of a true drama. However watching ""The English Patient"" my mind was mostly dominated by the fact that everything I saw was only acting and a bit too obviously contrived.<br/><br/>If the script had been better, other flaws of the movie were not so important: Although much of the story presents to us people that come together at the end of a war and, during the flashbacks, we are are supposed to see people that have spent many days on an expedition in the sandy desert, everybody looks neat and clean. A convoy of new cars with soldiers in new clothes drives along the road. Badly injured soldiers seem as if they came not from the battle field, but directly from the hairdresser. Artificial light is used too often for the sake of an evenly illuminated, but unnatural picture.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is much overrated. However, it is not unwatchable or insultingly stupid. In spite of the aforementioned flaws, I enjoyed it still enough to give it 6 out of 10 stars."

Hana, who is deeply hurting from losing a loved one (friends and lovers seem to die around her, making her feel cursed)sets up shop in a villa and cares for the mysterious patient. The patient, Count Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), is actually holding a lot of secrets, including an affair with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas), whose husband (Colin Firth) works for the war effort. Almasy's and Katherine's affair starts a spark that slowing begins to destroy everything and everyone around them. It happens so gradually that no one sees it until it's too late.<br/><br/>In the course of the movie, lives change. Hana begins a relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) while at the villa, while a mysterious man named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) is having conversations with the patient...who know exactly who he is and what secrets he is holding.<br/><br/>The film is a beauty to behold. The colors, the scenery, the acting, is very beautiful. The film will have you in tears (especially the end), so please have tissues in hand."

","One of the best Oscar 'Best Pictures' of recent times. This is a film that is best appreciated at the theatre. The small screen cannot do justice to the cinematography. The film really consists of two stories. The main story is told in flashback as the English Patient spends the last few days of the war (and his life) in a bombed out Italian villa. This is the story of the affair between Count Laszlo de Almásy (Fiennes) and Katharine Clifton (Scott Thomas). There is certainly chemistry between the leads and Katharine isn't the usual one dimensional Hollywood female role. <br/><br/>The other story between Hanna (Binoche) and Kip Singh is certainly not as convincing. Willem Dafoe is the glue between the stories who wants to find out whether the English Patient is Almásy. Sorry to harp on, but the real star of the film is the cinematographer and if this didn't win that award from the Academy I'd be amazed."

Now I have not read the book, and I am sure that the success of the film is due partly to the book. But the visual input and the creation of moods bring out the beauty and the tragedy of the story marvellously. I thought that with the demise of David Lean the days of big movies that could haunt the viewer days or weeks afterwards were over; but thanks to Anthony Minghella, we can look forward to glory days ahead.<br/><br/>One cannot talk about The English Patient without talking about Gabriel Yared's beautiful score. Again I am reminded of Lean's Doctor Zhivago that owed much to Maurice Jarre's score. Minghella really knows what to concentrate on to get the maximum effect on the viewer.<br/><br/>The final message, however goes beyond a tragic love story. The futility of war, hollowness of personal enmity, and the beauty of love are all drilled in with quiet vigour. After all, nine Oscars are not too much for such a masterpiece.

Yes, they do still make them like they used to, and this is what they look like.  Undeniably beautiful to look at, this eliptical story of a tragic love triangle set amidst the deserts of Africa in WWII, sucked in viewers and critics alike, and swept us away into a wonderful world where romantic epics were literary, smart, and everybody spoke with an accent.  Even if you find the central love story between Fiennes and Thomas and bit too ""British,"" you can't help but be compelled by Binoche's lovesick nurse who becomes determined to get to the heart of the mystery surrounding her dying patient.  Oh, and there are so many great scenes...the opening shot of the plane flying over the dunes, Binoche playing the piano in the bombed out building, the trapped in the jeep during the sandstorm scenario, the discovery of the cave drawings.

","Anthony Minghella adapts Michael Ondaatje's novel to create a film that nears perfection.  Minghella's screenplay is a masterpiece which separates The English Patient from the many solid but uninspired historical dramas of late.  Fortunately, the script is complemented by the virtuosic performances of Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Juliette Binoche and the stunning cinematography of John Seale.  Many moviegoers (and many critics) seem unable to grasp the complexity and subtlety of the film, which follows two time lines and examines history from a decidedly postmodern, non-Americano-centric position. Although the film has already enjoyed considerable critical acclaim, I believe the wider world (even Americans) will soon catch up with the vision of this film, and The English Patient will be established as one of the great movies of all time."

"annonefrog","10","2","5","4 January 2000"," Beautiful but painful
","I absolutely loved this film although I found it very emotionally draining. I thought that Anthony Minghella's script and its structure were excellent especially considering the complexity of the original novel.  In the end I realise that not everyone can appreciate a film but I feel that a lot of people did not fully grasp the complexity of this story.  So many films now are made without containing any kind of depth or worthwhile story and although they are often very entertaining, it was refreshing to watch a film which did not insult its audience's intelligence and simply told a story without feeling the need to include token special effects.  I also have to say that I gain something from and understand something more about this film every time I watch it, due to the strength of its story.  It is true that this film is extremely sad but I found that it acted as a catharsis.  It has also been accused of immorality but in my opinion it is naive to think that love is always warm and happy.  The destructive, overpowering nature of the relationship between the Count and Katharine was exactly what fascinated me so much in this film and what continues to reduce me to tears every time I watch it.  Finally it is a very beautiful film to watch due to the cinematography  and the music is amazing and perfectly fits the film.  If didn't fully appreciate this film the first time try and watch it again - it gets better with each viewing."
"Rommel","10","2","5","21 December 1999"," A masterpiece
","The first thing that struck me about this movie was the beautiful depiction of the love story between Katherine and Almazy. In most love movies, the main characters seem to fall in love simply because they are in the same movie and their love is usually depicted by them running laughing somewhere outside. In TEP the 2 main characters are characterized with a lot of depth to their personalities so it is easy to see why they are attracted to each other. Furthermore the dialogue between them is simply sparkling with intelligence.<br/><br/>The plot is very logically structured. At first viewing I was a bit put off by the tragic ending, but on further viewings I realized that the ending was perfectly integrated with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Of course the cinematography is absolutely beautiful as well as the accompanying music.<br/><br/>Many commenters complain about the acting being ""wooden"". I find it hard to understand that we are talking about the same movie. I have very rarely seen a movie where the personalities of the characters were so well depicted.<br/><br/>There are lots of fine details that will keep you thinking about the movie. One of my favorite scenes is the campfire in the desert where the explorers take turns performing. Katherine is very well contrasted to her dull husband who just sings a silly song about bananas, whereas she tells a greek myth, where her husband and Almazy are metaphorized.<br/><br/>A perfect 10 in my opinion."

But the story was totally out of some writer's imagination, loosely based on true events in pre-WWII Africa. When it got to the point that Count Almasy traded maps of northern Africa to the Germans for an airplane to recover his lover's corpse, I just sat there saying, ""Sheesh...he was a () traitor!"" over and over to myself in near disbelief. He didn't have much hero status to begin with, but that totally killed it for me. Then in the special features, we are told by a history professor that the real Count was actually on Rommel's staff.

"nakshirwany","10","2","6","16 August 2005"," Review of ""The English Patient""
","Michael Ondaatje's novel (of the same name and on which the movie is based) is not the most visual of books. It is an obtuse story, yet haunting in detail, mesmerizing in its depth. Minghella brings it to the screen perfectly capturing its entire emotional content. I recall gripping the armrest of my seat almost from that drifting opening image of a biplane flying over the sensuous ripples of desert sand interspersed with shots of a hand painstakingly drawing primitive human figures with a calligraphist's brush. I was hooked and knew in those moments that this was going to be a special treat.<br/><br/>The movie's story is not convoluted. Nevertheless, it appears veiled. The many layers of narrative are initially hidden and are then gently and beautifully revealed. This narrational unfolding could be the re-assembling of the tortured memory of its central protagonist, Count Almasy (possibly Ralph Fiennes finest portrayal), a badly burnt, dying young man who is being cared for by a French-Canadian Allied nurse, Hana (wonderfully nuanced performance by that elegant French actress, Juliette Binoche). He lies in a large bed that seems to accentuate his frail and damaged body. This is a makeshift nursing station in an abandoned Italian monastery put together by Hana. She has volunteered to separate from her medical unit because her charge is too ill to travel further. Who is her patient? Is he English? We don't initially know. Between the Count's morphine induced ramblings and some clarity afforded by the mysterious Carvaggio (very effective turn by Willem Dafoe) who descends on this desolate pair, we begin to learn Almasy's identity and the pieces begin to fall into place. An epic tale unfolds, some from the patient's faltering memory and others from the accusative probings of Carvaggio. It is an epic tale of an obsessive forbidden romance between Almasy and Katherine Clifton, the unfulfilled wife of his Royal Geographic Expedition colleague. We are never sure of where all this takes place. It must be the Middle Eastern desert. But exactly where? Even though we are geographically lost, we know the approximate temporal position of the story. World War II is waging. Somewhere in the expanse of a great desert, perhaps in North Africa, archaeologists (Almasy being one of them) hunt for something. That something is never central to the narrative. How Almasy meets Katherine and is engulfed and convulsed by his intense attraction to her, is. They meet, they love and just as they happen to touch the highest bliss of consummation, a torrent of events deeply incises their union.<br/><br/>It is compelling to think that this movie is a metaphor for something. It is full of so many exquisite images and so many literary underpinnings. I believe that it is like a Greek tragedy, crushing in it's impact, embodying a deep sense of where it unfolds. In this case the irony of a Hungarian nobleman, mistaken for being English because his accent is British. The irony that he is cared for a young woman growing to love his pain, his command of facts, his quotations from Herodutus, his notes scribbled on wrinkled inserts in books that allude to his affair that is so intense that she is envious of it. In some ways, the movie is about two romances. The first is the intense physical one that resides in the English Patients memory. The second is what transpires between her and her dying patient, grotesquely burnt and unrecognizable. In that sense, The English Patient is a metaphor for how war can tear away innocence and replace it with a weary wisdom, soon to vanish"
"zcorvin","10","2","6","23 May 2005"," It is not for everybody
","Excellent movie, but not for everybody. It is interesting to see what other viewers think of it and it surprises me how many people can't understand The English Patient. I am not talking about those who mix up the characters or have absolutely no knowledge about love or passion. I will not list what the film is all about or how you should perceive it, but I recommend to watch it maybe twice and things might get clearer. As I said, it takes a few things to fully understand it. If you are not familiar with the WWII destiny dramas nor tasted the tragic that love can brings sometimes, don't waste your time watching this movie... You might end up posting unfair reviews.

The breath taking cinematography, the haunting musical score, and the fine acting by Juliet Binoche, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Ralph Fiennes makes this an extraordinary film. However, the real credit for this masterpiece has to go to the Director and screenplay writer Anthony Minghela.  I read the book later, and found it to be horrible (I have had that experience with another Booker prize winner too). It is amazing that a movie based on that book could be that beautiful. It flows between the past and present with ease, and it is completely seamless. Although very long, I was never bored.  I have watched it several times since, and enjoyed it each time."

The nuances in what exactly is going on in the characters' heads are subtle, and the way in which Binoche and Fiennes intereact is mesmerizing, as well, of course, as Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas's exploits as the adulterous couple.  The build-up to the affair is well done, with foreshadowing such as the campfire myth.  The cinematography is drop-dead gorgeous, obviously.  For me there just isn't anything to complain about in this film, which is saying a lot giving how critical I am of films.  For those of you who are bored by the film, I suggest you stick to either action flicks or romantic comedies...something tells me you have trouble focusing on anything that requires any thought.  And for those of you shrug this movie off as just another drama receiving too many accolades, I suggest you watch the film again.  If you're paying attention to it, there are lots of subtle shifts in the characters' interactions/mannerisms that you might not catch if you don't realize what's going on.

"great_sphinx_42","6","2","6","10 June 1999"," Pretty But Passionless
","There is oh so much to like about this movie. Visually, it's stunning. The performances are all good, and I like most of the actors okay. The music by Gabriel Yared (one of my favorite film composers) is wonderful. In the technical aspects, it's great. My best friend, who is European, absolutely loves it. But when I watched her ""The English Patient"" video, I had a hard time caring. Frankly, I was bored. It's okay to have unlikable characters in a movie, and sometimes even have them be your protagonists, and if they happen to be star-crossed lovers-hey, even better. That's sort of unique, or at least not as cliched as most other romantic relationships in film. But I just couldn't really care about what became of these people, not because they were ""immoral"" but because they were boring. I keep on thinking maybe I should watch it again and see if it grows on me. Some movies are like that. As for the Academy Awards, well, this movie is done very well. But it sort of makes me sad to think that a pretty, passionless picture like this is considered the best that was done in an entire year. When you assemble the makings of a great film and then execute it in bloodless fashion, something like ""The English Patient"" will emerge-a movie that is somehow less than the sum of its parts."

","First time I watched this movie, I guess it was 1997, and I watched it 7-8 times more afterwards, I read the book... I highlighted many paragraphes in the book, I listened to the soundtrack thousands of times. Being a woman and a movie fan, I watch many ""romantic"" movies both new and oldies. This one was and still is my ""favourite"". So many things to remember from this movie only if you still have feelings and only if you can see what is beyond words...<br/><br/>""Half my days I can not bear not to touch you. The rest of the time I feel it doesn't matter if I ever see you again. It isn't the morality, It is how much you can bear.""<br/><br/>""I just want you to know. I don't miss you yet."" His face awful to her, trying to smile. Her head sweeps away from him and hits the side of the gatepost. He see it hurt her, notices the wince. But they have separated already into themselves now, the walls up at her insistence. Her jerk, her pain, is accidental, is intentional. Her hand is near her temple. ""You will."" she says.<br/><br/>How does this happen? To fall in love and be dissambled. I was in her arms.I had pushed the sleeve of her shirt up to the shoulder so I could see her vaccination scar. I love this, I said. This plae aureole on her arm. I see the instrument scratch and then punch the serum within her and then release itself, free of her skin, years ago, when she was nine years old, in a school gymnasium. ....<br/><br/>""Seas move away, why not lovers? The harbours of Ephesus, the rivers of Heraclitus dissappear and are replaced by estuaries of silt. The wife of Candaules becomes the wife of Gyges. Libraries burn. What had our relationship been?

Remember the last words of Catherine Clifton ""All I desired was to walk upon such a world with no maps""... <br/><br/>Everything is different than it seems, it even plays games with words in the sense of adjectives only if you can get it.

","Cinematically beautiful, well paced and superbly acted drama that kept me well engaged throughout. Despite this though, I was a touch underwhelmed due to the reputation this has as an Oscar-winning tearjerker. What holds this film back from greatness is the lack of likeability of the lead character. Don't get me wrong, Ralph Fiennes is on incredible form with the script he's given, but am I the only one that can't quite get behind a character that so blatantly and unscrupulously makes a play on a married woman? I was rooting more for Colin Firth to take him out with the duster than for the romantic leads to 'live happily ever after'. I just can't shed any tears for the woes of a pair of romantic leads that are so boldly engaging in adultery. That so many people have done I think speaks more about the decline in moral standards in society than anything else.<br/><br/>Wonderfully made picture, but the questionable morality holds it back from true greatness. The production code used to get stick back in the golden age, but it was there to make sure pictures were made to deliver the right messages."

","Shame that the Binoche character was not more in the character of a 1930's Canadian from Montreal as most Montrealers of the era did not speak English at all and if they did, it was with a distinct French- Canadian accent. Binoche speaks French and it would have been a breeze to allow her to do it even if it was only a French accent minus the Canadian touch. Willem Dafoe could also have done a Montreal accent and why David, (English) and Carraviggio, Italian ? <br/><br/>Where all those flashbacks really necessary? Maybe it was the producer's intent to require multiple viewings in order to get the whole story. <br/><br/>How could anyone actually have considered Demi Moore in the K part?

"Aly200","6","1","2","2 February 2017"," Exquisite Cinematography, Well Acted, but Overly Sentimental and Unnecessarily Long
","Winner of 9 Oscars and in my honest opinion one of the most overrated films in cinematic history. This should not take away from the fact that the film does beautiful locations with some stellar acting by its all star cast all under the keen directorial eye of Anthony Minghella.<br/><br/>Told mostly through flashbacks, the film based on the bestselling novel tells the tragic tale of a mysterious Hungarian Count and his love affair with a married Englishwoman in World War II Africa. The ""patient"" of the title is the Count telling his tale to the French Canadian nurse who is caring for him after a terrible accident that horrifically burned him, and also a Canadian Army Officer who is investigating the Count as part of an Intelligence operation. <br/><br/>The film boasts an all star cast giving some career-best performances. Playng the title ""English Patient"" (in his 2nd Oscar nominated role) is the wonderfully talented Ralph Fiennes as Count Almasy, a man supposedly of Hungarian nobility but whose past is so mysterious that we never learn who Almasy really is or where he came from. Fiennes is charming, brooding at times and eloquent in the role and makes the mystery surrounding his character even more compelling despite the unanswered questions about his past. Fiennes does display a formidable chemistry with costar Kristin Scott- Thomas who plays the married woman who is the object of his affections along with some minutely interesting (yet sadly wasted for all the flashbacks) scenes with fellow actors Juliette Binoche who plays his nurse and Willem Dafoe as the officer who is looking into Almasy's background. <br/><br/>Juliette Binoche won the film's only acting Oscar for her work as French- Canadian nurse Hanna who cares for the injured Count. The actress is subtle, soft-spoken and articulate mixed with naivety towards the dangers of the world she is living after a brutal international conflict. Hanna is still intelligent as she cares for those around her such as her patient, Officer David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who is looking into her patient's past but trusts him to protect them from harm, and particularly in her relationship with Kip, a British-Indian officer stationed near the villa where Hanna and her patient are sequestered. We don't learn about Hanna's background prior to the war and its aftermath, but what we see from Binoche's portrayal Hanna is the center of the present-day narrative as she connects with those around her.<br/><br/>Rounding out the other two key roles are Willem Dafoe as David Caravvagio, the officer seeking out Almasy, and Kristin Scott-Thomas as Katharine Cifton, the woman whom Almasy loved. As Caravvagio, Dafoe is a smaller character than than those of Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche and Kristin Scott-Thomas (despite receiving third billing), but the character has a connection that does matter to the narrative. Fiennes's Almasy was reputed to be a spy for the Axis Powers (which we and David never learn the actual truth) and his actions lead to a horrific consequence for Caravvagio; Caravaggio is tortured and loses some digits in one of the most harrowing scenes of the film (just hearing actor Willem Dafoe's screams and barely seeing the torture unfold made me have to cover my eyes and almost scream out myself). The tension is palpable between Caravvagio and Almasy in the present as Dafoe portrays a quiet desire for revenge for the wrong inflicted on him, but also a developing sympathy for the injured shell of a man before him in addition to the protective and caring nature that David displays towards young Hanna (it is clear that he probably harbored romantic feelings for Hanna) as she hides in the villa with her patient. Actress Kristin Scott-Thomas embodies the typical proper Englishwoman as Katharine Clifton; obedient, soft-spoken, well dressed and kemped but an intelligent woman. Katharine begins the film as a loyal wife to her husband (Colin Firth) who it seems would never be an adulteress, but when she begins to spend more time with Count Almasy, Katharine starts to question where her heart truly lies. She attempts to live both ways, but must make a choice when she fears that her husband will discover her affair with Almasy. The ultimate decision she makes ends up with a steep price for both her and her lover by the film's end.<br/><br/>The locations are stunning throughout the film as the narrative juxtaposes from war-torn Africa to the ravaged countryside of Italy in the present. The sets are confined for the Italian locales as we are isolated with the small ragtag group of Hanna, Count Almasy, David Caravaggio and Kip with his fellow officers who patrol the perimeter to protect the other three. Contrasting the isolation is the vast scope of the African deserts and crowded villages where we see many peoples from soldiers, townsfolk, some of the central and minor characters but also so much empty space once we are traveling the desert near the end of the flashback narrative. The vastness again evokes an isolating feeling.<br/><br/>The film's run-time is egregiously long and plodding which is the most irritating factor of the film other than the schmaltzy romance. Sitting through nearly three hours of a love story is excruciating even with the great cinematography and good acting. This boredom might evoke memories of a classic sitcom episode where a TV character openly expressed her dismay at sitting through multiple viewings of this film. I can relate because I get so bored that I have to keep myself busy to keep from falling asleep.<br/><br/>A stunning masterpiece of filmmaking despite its minor flaws."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","2","7 March 2015"," Excellent film in terms of drama and romance
","The almost three-hour-long ""The English Patient"" was the big winner at the 1997 Academy Awards scoring wins in no less than nine categories (maybe a bit too much even if I liked the film) despite coming short in Screenplay, Lead Actor and Lead Actress. However, the stunning Juliette Binoche surprisingly defeated Lauren Bacall in the supporting actress category. The film is almost 20 years old now and has aged pretty nicely. It's still a very good movie. Even if it plays during times of war, this is really just the setting. There are no long scenes of significant battles. It is much more about the (love) relationships of the central characters during these difficult times. Admittedly, the impact of war on these is very crucial.<br/><br/>In flashbacks we find out about Ralph Fiennes' character's fate while in the now, it is all about Juliette Binoche's character. That is also why her classification as a supporting character is slightly odd in the face of Scott Thomas playing a lead character. The movie has quite a few very dramatic and tense scenes. The highlight is probably the defusing of the big bomb by the Binoche's character's love interest in this movie. Edge-of-seat stuff with the loud noise approaching and I really wondered is he gonna survive it or is a catastrophe about to happen. Watch for yourself. Willem Dafoe was as good as always and he played once again a character where you can never be sure if he is good or bad and of course it is, as always with him, no clean black or white, but something in-between. All about shades. His questioning was also one of the most dramatic scenes of the film and almost physically painful to watch. There is also a parallel between his fate and the fate of Fiennes' character. Both are questioned and suspected of working for enemy forces, but while Dafoe's character fears his own death, Fiennes' character only fears the death of Kristin Scott Thomas' character.<br/><br/>This film was a breakthrough for many of the actors involved: Firth (unlikeable for once), Binoche and Fiennes to mention only a few, but also for many of the crew members who won Oscars for their work here. This movie is also quite an achievement in terms of technical aspects. Visually, it is great to watch and the sound work is effective as well. It is really difficult to pick a favorite scene, but as I mentioned some of the dramatically effective scenes already, I also want to name the church scene with Binoche and Naveen Andrews. Very very beautiful and so harmonic. Quite a joy to watch.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this movie directed and written by Anthony Minghella based on the novel by Michael Ondaatje. It has great emotional impact. Maybe, it is the film that comes closest to a description as a modern ""Lawrence of Arabia""."
"g-bodyl","9","1","2","27 March 2014"," Bold, Masterful Epic!
","The English Patient is a tale of doomed love and one that brings Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago to mind. Director Anthony Mingella must have drawn inspiration from David Lean because there are so many Lean-like features in the film including an exact eye for detail. This is a sweeping and ambitious film that any lover of film will enjoy. It may be a tad too long and perhaps saccharine at certain points, but this film screams epic at you.<br/><br/>Minghella's film starts off during the end of World War Two and after a plane crashes, this nurse named Hana cares for the mortally wounded Count Almasy who tells his story. While in Egypt, he falls in love with this woman named Katharine Clifton who is not happy with her husband. These two begin an affair which may lead to some harsh consequences.<br/><br/>This film is well-acted and has some career-best performances worth of many accolades. Ralph Fiennes is essentially playing two people in one body and while not a career-best, it ranks up there in his top-five performances. Juliette Binoche is very good as Hana whom the war has taken a toll on. Kristen Scott Thomas does a good job at seducing the Count. Also, I must mention Willem Dafoe because he does a good job as the guy who is out to seek revenge against the Count.<br/><br/>Overall, The English Patient is an ambitious project that is just a step away from perfection. I thought at times the romance wasn't as credible and seemed a little fake. But other than that, this film soars high. it has many stunning sequences, including the sandstorm scene. A very masterful film both technically and story-wise. A very David Lean-like film and that is a compliment. I rate this film 9/10."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","2","2 September 2012"," A good old fashioned epic!
","It's perhaps easier to simply make fun of this movie but it's in my opinion ridicules to call this a bad movie as well. Yes, it's all a bit drawn out at times, making this movie feel overlong and overall pointless but it's all actually being very consistent with the style of film-making and the approach they were going for with this movie.<br/><br/>Basically this movie is being like an old fashioned epic, with grand looking landscapes and a bigger than life story, or in this case love story, in which everything moves slowly but steadily. As often is the case with this type of movies, it's hard to get into at first, since it doesn't really become apparent, right from the start on already, which direction the story will be heading at. But once things are starting to take form and it becomes more clear what the story is going for, it becomes an engaging movie, as also truly was the case with this movie.<br/><br/>I really loved it how things slowly started to take shape within this movie. It also made it more apparent what an actual good and original story this movie has in it. It's not being too complicated either, which makes this movie all the more engaging to watch. No, this really is far from being pretentious genre movie, though it still has some pretentious tendencies in it, especially when it comes down to its acting and characters.<br/><br/>Let me just say I wasn't too fond of all the performances in this movie and that goes for Ralph Fiennes' as well. He actually somewhat annoyed me, which is something that Fiennes had never achieved before, at least not with me. I truly think he is one of the best living and still working actors around but in this movie he went for an approach I just didn't liked very well. <br/><br/>But really, it might also be very well due to his character and the writing of the movie that I couldn't really appreciate his performance. His character, in my opinion, isn't being likable enough and the love story he gets himself involved in also isn't exactly my idea of a romantic one. Nothing cute about a love story that involves infidelity and it prevented me from rooting for its main characters and for them to end up being together.<br/><br/>But OK, I get it. Love just happens sometime, no matter what the place or the circumstances are. And then again, the love story in this movie was never meant to be a happy or careless one, in which everything works out peachy perfect. And that's actually what saved it and made this movie work for me, once I started to realize all of that. It also definitely makes this an original romantic movie, also since the romance itself is often hard to find in the movie. Please don't mistake this movie for a chick-flick, or something like that, since the movie and its story have far more to offer and often goes for a far from typical romantic approach with things.<br/><br/>There are also plenty of other things happening in this movie. It doesn't just follow 2 main characters but it has a wide variety of characters in it, each with their own thing going on. It gives the movie plenty of welcome distractions and often helps to give the movie and some of its themes more depth as well. It's also a nice touch that the movie is basically following 2 plot lines, one set in the 'present' and one in the past, all linked together by its main character, played by Ralph Fiennes. This also helps to give the movie some variety and helps to keep the story moving and it's being a good way for the movie to have some mystery and surprises in it as well.<br/><br/>Just as good as any other genre movie from the earlier days of the genre, in my opinion!<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"georgioskarpouzas","7","1","2","3 March 2010"," a complex herodotian story of love and war
","I have watched this movie when it was first released in my country without having formed a clear picture of it's action and plot but being impressed by it's visual imagery and the names of the actors present. Recently I read the book and afterwards watched the movie again. This time I acquired a much clearer view of both the film and the book.<br/><br/>There are many things to comment in such a complex movie but what I found the most interesting is that it tells a story(or rather stories) of people of different backgrounds and races while war forms the unifying thread of the narrative. In this sense it is very much a history as Herodotus would have conceived it-Herodotus who is mentioned as the favourite writer of the central hero. Also one of his most famous novellas is narrated in the film by the heroine Catherine, a rather lecherous story, told by a heroine about to commit adultery.<br/><br/>This is a film about the consuming human passions:sexual love, war, the yearning to explore the unknown, revenge. It is an eminently humanistic film depicting humans with their characteristic frailties(warts and all as the English say)but never in a cheap or demeaning manner.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes gives a fine performance as Count Almasy, both as a rush young-to middle-aged man and as the deformed crippled patient. He is an explorer, adulterer, adventurer and someone forced by circumstances to take sides(the wrong-that is the one who lost) in war, in which he had no personal interest.<br/><br/>Christin Scott Thomas is perfect as the vain, classy, intelligent and ultimately unlucky British lady whose fate become intermingled with that of Almasy because of mutual lust.She also has some fine erotic scenes within the logic of a mainstream movie.<br/><br/>Juliette Binoche gives an understated performance of the compassionate nurse who caters for the deformed and sick Almasy.Her likable physique renders a likable character.<br/><br/>Naveen Andrews is credible as the Sikh sapper of the British army who falls in love with the nurse although his character, military training, ideological convictions are much curtailed in the movie compared with the details devoted to them in the book.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe has the style and face to play the cunning and controversial character of David Caravaggio, a former thief enlisted to the allied cause.<br/><br/>Collin Firth has the appearance and acumen of British gentleman in Africa and bears with stiff upper lip the suspicions of his wife's infidelity until his jealousy overcomes him leading him to suicidal actions.<br/><br/>Some other minor characters people this multi layered movie, having flat characteristics opposed to the ambiguities and moral ambivalence of the main personae.<br/><br/>The desert and the colonial metropolis of Cairo are presented in an inspiring manner while Italy at the end of world war two is portrayed with minimalist simplicity.<br/><br/>It is a good movie about the perennial passions of the human soul played on the vast canvas of the Libyan desert and the Italian peninsula as interesting and charming human beings are entrapped in a conjecture that overcomes them. The device of the flashback is also more appropriate and comprehensible in the movie than in the book on which it is based."
"kashpunj","7","1","2","9 July 2007"," good performances, story a bit dry and slow
","When this film first came out, I remember it being a phenomenon, especially with women. Literally, there were women who watched it a dozen times in theatres. For some reason, I never watched it until this year and I must say that I found myself underwhelmed by certain aspects of the movie. Though the movie is solid and above average, I can't imagine why the committee decided to give it NINE Oscars. <br/><br/>On the whole, the movie does deserve heaps of praise for the cinematography and overall direction. The vistas of North Africa and Tuscan Italy of the WWII era are wonderfully captured. In addition, the performances of Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, and Willem Dafoe are standout. However, the movie lags and moves SLOWLY. I watched this with my family and we almost popped the DVD out after the first half hour. However, once the story gets going it will rarely let go. Also, if you are anathema to movies about the power and tragedy of love (aka chick flick material) then steer clear, it will not convince you otherwise about the genre. Some of the dialogue made me cringe and question if some of the scenes were adapted ideally from the book.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is still solid and most people will find something to like here. If you're patient with ""The English Patient"", a rollicking love story and adventure is in store."
"Bola","Null","1","2","26 December 1998"," Cannot be better
","I love this movie mostly because of the sophistication of the portrayal of the characters and the expression of the love between Katharine and Almasy. This is of course attributed to Michael Ondaatje. But, Anthony Minghella did do a great job in translating all these into the movie while having reconstructed the whole story. The movie does provide a more coherent version though the time zones jump as frequently as that of the original do. In comparison, the shift of the focus and the alteration made to the relationship between Hana and Kip do no harm to the movie at all. On the contrary, it helps to balance the tragic hard feeling of the main story by leaving the delightful free love relationship an open end, and a hope of sort. This bring a little perkiness to the movie. And, it makes a contrast by showing another kind of sadness and helplessness of living separaion. It is interesting and enjoyable to look for the hidden meanings too. For example, the book of the English patient is seen by me as a symbol of love of Almasy to Katharine. There are a lot else to talk about. Also, the cinematograhpy is amazing. Particulary, I can hardly forget how  I was stunned by the shot right at the beginning, which changes the swimming men being drawn on the paper into the ridges of a desert. And, Ralph is never handsome by  my standard but he just attracts me by exactly showing the unique disposition of a man of rationality with a fire deep in his heart. Last but not the least, the music itself is beautiful  and it works just as well when being played as the soundtrack. By the way, I think the value of art of the movie should not be undermined or determined by the moral decisions made by the characters. It is fairer to treat the ethical issues brought up from the movies separately. It is a pity to be not able to appreciate the movie."

","Seeing this in the theater over ten years ago I remember thinking that I missed an important subplot. My belief was that I'd overlooked something that justified the adultery, the Count's actions, Carragio's pursuit, etc. I believed that knowing what had evaded me would have created dramatic tension as well as making me see the main characters in a better light than I'd witnessed in my ""uninformed"" viewing.<br/><br/>Watching the DVD over a decade later, I have exonerated myself. The scenery is breathtaking, the acting first class and the dialog witty. But despite TEP's length, what you see is what you get; i.e., there are no important details or consideration behind the curtain. The Count is, at face, a cold, arrogant and selfish SOB. But beneath the surface he is really a cold, arrogant and selfish SOB. Pardon the sarcasm.<br/><br/>Trim TEP down to about 110 minutes and you've a good film.

"sbox","4","3","14","9 August 1999"," Beautiful Film Destroyed by Banal Characters
","It's hard to give a rot for this film.  Consider the characters and their actions.  First, the ""love affair"" is suspect.  The torrid affair borders more on infatuation and selfish indulgence, punctuated by a bizarre scene in the midst of a Red Cross, Christmas dinner for soldiers.  Such offensive behavior barely bothers the paramours as they so dimly illuminate later on, ""we are the real countries.""<br/><br/>Perhaps this belief is why Fienes' character was adroit at treason. Numbskulls are supposed to believe that Count Laszlo was forced to deal with the Germans in order to keep his promise with his gal (the real country). Not so fast.  He had his chance with the British first.  Not only did he seal his own fate by extremely strange behavior, we never get to see him commit treason with the Germans.  We are just told about it.  I posit that scenes with the Count selling out the British for a plane would properly trash his character.<br/><br/>The Count's love interest is an educated yet indifferent figure.   She marries a lifelong friend and suffers (shazam) an indifferent marriage. She reads poetry well and states her views.  This is nice window dressing but no more.  Despite cheating on a husband she doesn't love and surviving his murder- suicide attempt, she remains stoic to the end.  Barf!  Plane crashes hurt, especially the ones you don't walk away from.  She didn't.  Her lover, the Count had to carry her a long way, while  she labored through dignified comments ad nauseum.<br/><br/>And what about that husband of hers?  Despite the fact that he gets weird and attempts to kill the love triangle (literally), we don't see him devolve into suicidal depression, it just happens.<br/><br/>Now on to the other characters which reside years after the tragedy of the love triangle.  First we tackle the Indian Army officer.  His initial entry into the film is accompanied by his no nonsense style in which he makes it clear he is not interested in the English Patient's nurse.  He changes his mind in a nice scene in which he lays out a candle trail to his heart. This really worked.  Unfortunately, by the end of the film, it all ends up, ""wham bam, thank you ma'am.""  Of course they will always have their church in which he gave her an art lesson.  This really makes no sense to me except to validate one night stands as legitimate love affairs.<br/><br/>The nurse herself is the most disappointing character.  She is distraught after seeing a friend die.  This triggers something within her that demands that she take a hiatus from the war to care for the English Patient.  She works really hard and does well for him while contending with various interlopers.  The really frightening scene is how she emotionally euthanizes her ward upon his request.  She would never have done this at the outset. However, after learning about his situation, she wisely decides that he is better off dead.  I'm sure utilitarians are satisfied by these events.  As for me, I'm appalled.<br/><br/>The only benevolent character seems to be the man sans thumbs.  His dark search which doesn't involve redemption actually receives it.  He is a triumphant figure who trades in darkness for good.  However, this man's limited involvement in the film isn't enough to balance the rest.<br/><br/>A summation of this film is to compare it to a trashy drugstore novel. The characters wear pretty clothes, engage in ""forbidden"" sex, and suffer tragic ends.  Romance fulfilled."
"ScoopIrish","6","2","8","11 December 2004"," Guys, stay away from this one...
","I can admire a film for being well crafted, and certainly The English Patient is a beautifully shot and well directed movie. However, the plot plods along slower than a geriatric retiree with arthritis in both knees. Why some women think that this is such a romantic tale is a mystery to me -- my confusion must result from a limitation of owning ""Y"" chromosomes. The lesson I took away from the movie was: if you cheat on your husband, you'll die alone in a cold dark cave. When I shared this insight with my wife, she looked at me in horror and said, exasperated, ""You obviously didn't get it."" Too true, and precisely my point. This movie isn't about romance -- it's heavy orchestral atmosphere and pointless tragedy pretending to be romantic. Romances have a hero, and no one -- repeat, no one -- acts heroic in this story. When I left the theatre, I kept wondering: what the heck was the point of that? In short, if you're a man -- unless you have super-extraordinary emotional sensitivity -- you'll be bored out of your mind while watching The English Patient. If you get dragged in to see this movie, bring a lot of patience -- pun intended."
"martin-intercultural","8","1","3","27 December 2017"," Good film, slightly overrated
","I watched this film 20+ years after its original release. I did have some apprehensions - e.g. I thought it was ""about the war""; and I knew for a fact it was very long.
Overall, it has aged well. To my relief, the plot is not so much about the war, but rather about civilian people swept up in the war. 
Was the movie too long? It was. Not necessarily boring or dragged out sort of long, mind you. But I do think the tale could have been told just as powerfully in 90 minutes as it was in 162: The man with no face - use him to frame the story; lose the rest. Punjabi guy searching for landmines and/or washing his hair? I am all for a good interracial romp, onscreen and off, but really -- what did he add to the story? Cut. The Willem Dafoe character? Cut. 
Lastly, and not to be a complete heretic: I love French cinema, and I can see how the part-Slavic La Binoche may have been a revelation to 90s US audiences, what with her Deneuve-esque power of projection coupled with a Bette Davis-style ability to ""do nothing"" in the face of great turmoil. Personally I found her role in this film to be one of a glorified narrator, whose presence could have been confined to under ten minutes. And not only that. In truth, some of her zany but wholesome antics, midway through, set in the ruins of the bombed-out cloister, actually brought to mind the words ""Nokia. Connecting People"". Sorry; they did. 
Ultimately, all of the above contributes little to, and greatly pales in comparison with, the main story, acted out solidly by Ralph Fiennes and rivetingly, refreshingly yet timelessly by Kristin Scott Thomas. This is where the wow factor is; we didn't need the distractions which only served to bloat this saga to nearly three hours in length."

","I completely agree with other comments here: hopelessly romantic, filmed in a similar pace to the original writing, wonderful panoramic scenes, nice romantic theme throughout and steeped in steeped in pseudo-historical reference. But ultimately a cinematic disaster with so many mistakes, technical and cinematic errors, which is why it is often a bye-word for disaster amongst cinema lecturers and students. And still it won 9 Oscars, including: -Best Picture Saul Zaentz -Best Director Anthony Minghella (before cutting off Caravaggio's fingers, one of the German officers asks in German ""what about the Geneva Convention?"" which is curious considering that the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners wasn't signed until 1949 and came into effect in 1950) -Best Cinematography John Seale (despite crew or equipment or shadows of same being visible in almost every filmed scene) -Best Art Direction-Set Decoration Stuart Craig Stephenie McMillan (US flags in 1942 would not have 50 stars but 48) -Best Costume Design Ann Roth (despite US soldiers wearing Russian WWII army helmets and 3 German officers wearing conflicting badges and rank insignia (one being a Waffen SS officer, none of whom served in North Africa)<br/><br/>-Best Sound Walter Murch Mark Berger David Parker Christopher Newman (despite thunder incorrectly and unnaturally added to a sequence of a thunderstorm, and the flash, bang and shock-wave of an exploding bomb being experienced simultaneously at a distance) -Best Film Editing Walter Murch (Despite 3 scenes being sequenced incorrectly in the final movie)<br/><br/>One must ask why Ondaatje/Minghela were so sadistic? An apparently injured (terminally) pilot is found with horrific burns in North Africa (Libya?)) and is carried by road to Egypt where he is put on a hospital ship and transported to Sicily and proceeds to follow the front line up through Italy until a Canadian nursing officer takes it upon herself to leave the convoy to save the patient any discomfort etc etc WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO simply place the patient on board the hospital ship in Tobruk or one of the many functional Allied ports in North Africa and send him directly back to Britain (as they thought he was English)...seems a little mean to the poor guy? The scriptwriter should have known that Ethiopia is not, as Katherine observed, in North Africa...tsk tsk!

But Dafoe does the part well, coming off as nasty and jealous. Which, really, suits him rather well.

At the beginning of the movie we see Almásy crash with a plane what leads to burnings all over his body. Almásy temporary loses his memory and is taken care of by the Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) with whom he shares his returning memories.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, The English Patient is not just about this romance. It also makes us aware of the problems of failed communication and of seeing the world only as hostile nationalities.<br/><br/>The movie's cast, which combines famous names like Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Juliette Binoche, Colin Forth or Willem Dafoe, is sublime. <br/><br/>Fiennes and Scott-Thomas share absolutely great chemistry. Scott-Thomas shows wonderful passion and eroticism, especially with her eyes and Fiennes gives probably one of his most memorable performances. Juliette Binoche is like the emotional center of the movie. She gives a warm, joyous, but also fragile performance that is wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>The performances as well as the epic shots, a brilliant score and a passionate screenplay turn this movie in one of today's epic masterpieces which shouldn't only been watched because of its romantic love story but also because of its important historical background."

He is cared for by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse, who set out to care for the man in an abandoned monastery in rural Italy. The two develop a bond and he slowly regains his memory where he was a geographer in Egypt, making maps of the desert. He remembers having an affair with Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) who was married to his best friend Geoffrey (Colin Firth). The affair was the reason for why he was injured. As well as the memories and the story in North Africa, Hana starts to have a relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh Indian engineer who was in the British Army. But she struggles to truly led herself go. The other person at the monastery is David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian Intelligence Operative from Italian descent. He had his thumps cut off by the Germans and he blames The English Patient for what happened.<br/><br/>The English Patient is an actor's film. Many of the actors were nominated for Oscars and other awards, Juliette Binoche even won on for best Supporting Actress. All the actors offered great performance, Ralph Fiennes, William Dafoe and Kristin Scott Thomas are all top talents and I personally thought Naveen Andrews was also very good. The film was also able to blend the flash-backs and present time effective, allowing the audience to follow the plots easily enough. He is a well structured film, with solid writing and direction. The direction is solid. They are some good scenes with some tension and the mystery is reviled slowly. They is wonderful cinematography. But is the film worthy of Oscars for best film and best director? Doubtful in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you like romantic films such as Titanic you should enjoy the English Patient."
"denis888","7","1","3","22 September 2007"," Intense Drama In The Times Of War
","The English Patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise. I say, most, because this movie, albeit very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers some drawbacks. First and foremost, why, oh why are the modern films so long? This one lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the film were an hour shorter, that would serve it only good. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is still very good. It is a deep, insightful treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is a smashing superb actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for everything only to save the life of his lover. He is great, even though half the time he is a deformed cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot with her excellent play and the love story plot with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all enormous and all very strong. And then there is desert of Egypt, then there is deep, cloudless sky, green groves of Italy. The nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. War is here, too. It is obvious, terrible, and bloody. Then, there are corpses, horrible gory bodies, then nude bodies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. So much of a splendid actors' work, so much of realism, so much of brutality that war brings. This is not a film for relaxation. It makes you think."

"johnny-m","Null","1","3","19 December 2003"," In Search for Poetry
","It is rare when a filmmaker manages to shine in his first features, especially after 20 years of continuous work in television. Well, Anthony Minghella is such a case: an artist to discover the boundaries of poetry only when reaching complete maturity. And what an artist! ""Truly Madly Deeply"" (1991) and ""Mr. Wonderful"" (1993) where respectable pieces, that established him as a craftsman in the field; but it wasn't until ""The English Patient"" (1996) that we got to see the godlike creative power of the man who later gave us ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999) and ""Cold Mountain"" (2003).<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" is veritable poetic art, and, as with poetry, it opens delicately and invites you to share the experience of a lifetime, quietly, so you could hear Gabriel Yared's harmonious tunes in the process. Hana (Juliette Binoche) a Canadian nurse, lost in the deserted minefields of World War II Italy, is in search for life and scope. As in Ondaatja's novel, she gradually starts to rediscover reality once she is put in the care of an amnesiac Count Laszlo Almásy (Ralph Fiennes). Neither Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews), her new found lover, nor David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), her countryman, manage to fulfil her soul's need. None, but Almásy and his stories about the Egyptian deserts, about the winds of Sahara, and more importantly his own story: `And the story, well, there's this Hungarian count. He's a wanderer. He's a fool. And for years he's on some kind of a quest for... who knows what. And then one day, he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman. A harpy, who beats him, and hits him, he becomes her slave, and he sews her clothes, and worships'  Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). A truly moving relationship unfolds, which reduces to a blubbering mess even the most cold-hearted among us.<br/><br/>Binoche, in her Oscar-winning role, is so simple and real, which makes Hana's breakdown even more tragic. Scott Thomas, in her best performance, is just beautiful in the entire sense of the word: sensual, talented, ignorant, and so passionately in love. And then Fiennes captures exquisitely the sheer complexity of the English patient, the vastness of Herodotus's poetry of the desert.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" is a definite must-see for any serious filmgoer. It is a rare case when art managed to transcend the boundaries of this world, and mainly because it was a film made out of love for beauty. The production has run out of the budget before the film was finished, which meant that the actors, the director, most of the crew, left with empty pockets, received only the catharsis of creation, hoping of a smashing success. There was no alternative, but superlatives at all levels."

"quixoboy","Null","1","3","12 September 2003"," Wow!
","I JUST finished watching this film about an hour ago, and - not surprisingly - a lot of the images, music, and performances still remain etched in my brain...It will probably end up that way for a long time, as this film actually holds a rather special significance for me: in my experience this was the first motion picture that familiarized me with and got me interested in watching the annual Academy Awards telecast! I can vividly remember all the near-unanimous critical praise this epic masterpiece had been receiving back in 1996, for everything from its direction to its screenplay to its passionate exchanges; I also remember the truckload of Oscars that was bestowed upon it the following year as well. Viewing the film now, for the first time, it is quite simple to see why this film managed to appeal to the critical masses. ""The English Patient"" truly is one of those films that has ""everything"" (i.e. action, adventure, romance, etc.) in my opinion. It is an impressively told, and superbly adapted film version of the Michael Ondaatje novel (which, incidentally, I had just finished reading a few weeks prior). Obviously it is not a totally flawless work when it comes to interpreting the order of some scenes (although it comes pretty darn close at times) - yet I still have a phenomenal amount of respect and admiration for all the cast and crew involved to translate this seemingly difficult-to-translate novel into a movie. Believe me. Those like me who have read the novel will probably agree that it couldn't be easy to film something like this - much less film it WELL.<br/><br/>If there's anything however that's really worthy of singling out to congratulate endlessly, for me it would have to be the unbelievably brilliant casting. Whoever put such a rich and talented group of actors together (all of whom were pitch-perfect for the roles) should be given a lot of credit, because these people pulled it off to shocking perfection! For me they were all very well reflective of the general way I imagined the characters in the novel (although you could say that I knew a lot about the film and its actors far before I even read the novel, but that's besides the point). They were engaging, they were beautiful, they were radiant...the ideal cast for such an old-fashioned, uplifting award-sweeping romance as this one. I loved it!<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" is a dazzling, fine work of art that more than deserved its staggering number of Oscar wins (including the Best Picture of 1996!), and I highly recommend it.

","I Love the Internet Movie Database, it's the best site for movie freaks like me. I also love to read comments of my favorite movies; I'm very objective in that matter, everyone is free to say his own opinion. And in the comments of  movies like Star Wars, A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Alien, Titanic, Citizen Kane (some of my favourite movies) I've read some likable comments and some disgusting points of view, but I accepted their opinion. But When I got to read The English Patient (Which, if you read my name at the title of this comment you'll see how fan I am) comments I couldn't stand it anymore, I have to make you all understand why this movie deserves NINE Oscars. This goes out especially to the people out there that sympathizes with Elaine (from Seinfeld) opinion of this movie. When 2001 hit the theaters in 1968, many people hated it, they said it was boring and too long. Ok, it didn't win nine oscars but its considered the best science fiction film of all time; its funny the fact that it was a boxoffice success because of the hippies who loved the coloured psychedelic journey. What I mean by this is that when you see a movie first of all you gotta know previously what kind of movie you are going to see. If is a movie like Independence Day or Twister you should expect explosion, great SFX, cool dialogues, and an acceptable running time. But if you´re going to see a movie named TEP, 2001, The Godfather, The Thin Red Line, you got to have a open mind about the whole context of it.  That´s why I can see almost every kind of movie they´re showing, except musicals (I hate musicals).<br/><br/>The English Patient opens with a beautiful image of a brush painting a figure we don´t know what it is yet. A woman's voice begins to sing---Szerelem, szerelem, she cries in a haunting lament for her loved one. After the credits we realized the figure is a man swimming (we´ll see where that comes from later). Then we change our view to THE DESERT seen from the air. An ocean of dunes (remember the swimmer) for mile after mile. The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black and makes the dunes look like bodies pressed against each other. An old AIRPLANE is flying over the Sahara, there is a woman who appears to be asleep, behind her the pilot , a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet. He is singing, too, but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's plaintive voice.<br/><br/>This are the first images of TEP and believe me it captures my attention simply because of its beauty; maybe because I love the desert. I own this movie on DVD and every frame of the cinematography is worth pausing and admiring. TEP is a movie about mature and intellectual people who are caught up in a time of barbarians who only think about making history by obtaining power over the world. The team of International Explorers are only thinking about making history by contributing with proofs of ancient civilization. They don´t care about countries, or frontiers. You have to be very observant in a movie like this. Watch every frame, it doesn´t matter who long does it last on screen, in a movie like this is not there just because of a bad editing. Think about Hana for a moment, she´s the most naive character in the movie ""I don´t know about anything"" she say to TEP when he´s talking about Herodotus, but despite of this she´s the most sympathetic character in the film. Catherine and Count Almasy are the main love story, they are intelligent and passionate characters. She´s married to a clown and sees in Almasy a mysterious man who talks many languages (but doesn´t like to talk), knows many cultures, doesn´t have a home, has got a beautiful handwriting, wrotes poems and its passionate about beauty and art, and if that wasn´t enough he´s handsome; what more do you want?. Many people just sees those two like a lustful couple who have no really interest in the other but in sex. That´s an easy answer for somebody who don´t understand them. When they met they have a discussion about an essay Almasy wrote, there they have their first chemistry shock. When they are telling stories in front of the fire everybody male (except Almasy) is telling a funny and shallow story, but when Catherine´s turn is up she impresses everybody (especially Almasy) by telling a story from Herodotus about a king named Candaules (who is a metaphor of Clifton) who is too proud of his wife and he´s showing her to a subject naked and by that shaming her.  Almasy is mighty attracted to her and that´s why he doesn´t want her to stay when Clifton leaves for an errand, and that´s why he´s rude why her whenever she tries to talk to him or give him the paintings of the swimmers from the credits. This is not an ordinary couple, this is a mature couple of two adults who feel an enourmus attraction and by that betrays everything they know by being together, although she (being a woman) has more integrity at betrayal and leaves him because she knows that´ll never work. I don´t know about you but I have 21 years old and I´ve been in those situations when you are so attracted to a girl, and also is she but cannot be together because she is already taken and cannot betray the man that she loves (or once loved for that matter). The Ending is what I call total climax. There is our Count Almasy running in the desert to save the woman he loves, and maybe he´s thinking that if he does they can be together, and believe it or not they die together (metaphorically). Honestly, If I was going to die of love, I hope it´ll be like that. I´m not going to tell the whole meaning of every part of the movie, I will leave it here. I hope it makes you think more about movies and especially this one. Why if any of you people didn´t like ""2001, The Thin Red Line, and The English Patient"" think it won so many Awards?, you just have to look further deep. You cannot expect to be told everything in the script or in the images (although they have)."

","This film is indeed the best film I have ever seen, pushing the Star Wars trilogy off of the top spot, and the cast is nothing short of fantastic, save one: Juliette Binoche. Why on earth was she cast for this role? I know it's unfair to compare film & novel, but wouldn't it have been possible to make her character just a LITTLE bit more downcast? Binoche is an actress whose radiance just cannot be turned off it seems which make it look that she's generally very happy with the situation she's in with just the odd bit of feeling a little down (like when she finds out her boyfriend's been shot to bits & when she sees Jan being blown to pieces). Not very believable. Thank goodness Fiennes, Scott Thomas and Dafoe make up for it all with their BRILLIANT performances for which they should all have received Oscars. I still think Ralph and Krisitin would have won if they had been American instead of British.<br/><br/>Such beautiful colours, such moving music and a perfect script as well (with a STORY! Wow! VERY un-90s). Really, there's little wrong with this film, it's just a shame about Binoche."

I have to say that the grandeur of John Seale's Oscar winning pictures were breathtaking from beginning to end. The story is well told although there are a few unlikely events. Ralph Fiennes' character being arrogant and pompous, it seems a bit improbable that Kristin Scott Thomas' character should fall for him so quickly. She, however, is to die for.

The English Patient inexplicably won just that many.  This is justifiably enraging, but take the rage out on the academy not the film. The English Patient is a terrific film, reminiscent of the old epic Hollywood films.  It easily deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.  It is a beautiful and emotional film, with acting rarely seen on the big screen. Many may find it slow, but I for one find it fascinating.<br/><br/>Sadly, this film gets lumped together with other dominating films like Titanic and Shakespeare in Love.  None of these films deserved as many awards as they got, but that should not take away from the films.  Of the three, TEP is easily the best.  Forget the awards and enjoy.  9 out of 10.

","THE ENGLISH PATIENT was eagerly anticipated when I rented the video. It had just won nine Academy Awards and I knew I was in for something special.<br/><br/>WRONG. In the past, moviemakers used flashback techniques in a way that was not confusing. You always knew you were watching a flashback. Not so in The English Patient. In fact, you seldom know whether you are in the past or present, the blurring of the time span is so confusing. No wonder several commentators have said they had to watch it a second or third time to sort out the pieces of this gigantic puzzle. I can endure no such punishment.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is brilliant and so are the performances--they can't be faulted. But to spend three hours waiting for all of the loose ends to come together for an unspectacular climax is just too much. What I resent most about the film is the irritating story structure which makes viewing it a sheer test of patience and endurance.<br/><br/>Not a film I'm ever likely to view again!

","Loosely based on Michael Ondaajte's book, Anthony Minghella's rendition of this war-time love story combines themes of love, betrayal, patriotism, morality, faith, and mortality.  With a much deserved Best Picture Oscar, the movie is beautifully filmed, the plot intricately and masterfully laid out, and is accompanied by a masterpiece of a score.  Repeat viewings are required for this movie as the plot can be at first difficult to understand. Indeed, it wasn't until the second and third times I saw it, that I truly grasped how intricately layered it was with themes about humanity.  A rich and deeply absorbing movie, it is both emotionally captivating and intellectually satisfying.  Don't be put off by it's long running time. It's well worth it.

","""I wanted to meet the man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives."" This is what Katherine Clifton tells Almasy on their first meeting. Without sounding too rapturous, I have to say that adjectives fall short of describing the beauty and magnificence of this movie! Lately we've had quite a few movies which have been touted by the media and the various awards alike as great, but which have not seemed so on viewing after all... This is one movie which deserved all the encomium and awards it received. As a matter of fact, I think it was a case of oversight on the part of the jury to not hand over the Best Acting Oscars to Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes. <br/><br/>                Extra-marital affairs have been the subject of quite a few books and movies(Fiennes, coincidentally is in 'The End of the Affair' which deals with the same subject), but what makes this movie an exception is the vivid way in which the story unfolds. The opening shot, of the plane gliding over the desert is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful I've seen. The two parallel stories, Hana and Almasy's stay in the dilapidated house and the flashback of Almasy's meeting and affair with Katherine blend effortlessly, culminating into a truly inspiring end. Both these parallel pieces are accentuated by great acting, not only by the leads, but by the supporting actors like Naveen Andrews, Willem Dafoe and Colin Firth. Colin Firth, incidentally, in his huge repertoire of movies has never looked as good as he does in this movie! Not even when he played Mr. Darcy in 'Pride and Prejudice'! Juliette Binoche renders with subtlety and grace the character of Hana who evolves emotionally through her interaction with Almasy, Kip and Caravaggio. She deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar hands down...Even though I have great respect for Lauren Bacall(nominated in the same category for 'The Mirror Has Two Faces' and a favorite for the Oscar), I'm glad for once the jury gave the Oscar to someone who truly deserved it.<br/><br/>
	I think the show-stealer, apart from the great cinematography is Ralph Fiennes! He gives an incredibly moving and sympathetic performance, both as the lover who loses the one he most loves and as the invalid whose only hope is a union with Katherine after death. With Binoche, he's the one who moves the story forward, doing justice not only to his character but also doing credit to his drop-dead good looks! This is the kind of movie which should go into cinematic history as one of the Best ever. It's time we stop considering just 'Casablanca' or 'Gone With The Wind' as the yardstick for great film-making or acting, 'The English Patient' is a modern classic...and Anthony Minghella, a real genius! One only hopes that the kind of greatness displayed in this movie can be seen in many more contemporary movies..."

Yes, the music and the cinematography were mesmerizing - I haven't seen the equal since Apocalypse Now.  But such beauty could not sustain my interest for 3 hours.  The movie spent most of its time fantasizing and romanticizing about adultery and treason, which was bad enough.  But maybe this was just a reflection of our society and its morals and ideals (or lack thereof) as they exist today.  Interesting how the downward spiral of our society can be seen in the so-called ""masterpieces"" coming out of Hollywood.

Almacy's own air crash, caused by German flak, follows not long after.

Whilst doing that, more of this man's background information is released to the sweet American nurse(Juliette Binoche in her Oscar winning role) and a stranger(Willem Dafoe) who claims that this man ruined his life.<br/><br/>The English Patient is a beautiful film with so many great qualities, even if it does go on for too long.

It's rich in poetry, colour and emotions. Yared's scintillating score and Seale's dazzling cinematography really capture the poetic essence of the scenes. Even though 'The English Patient' is a long epic film, it flows at a smooth and fluid pace. Minghella knows how to tell a story of epic proportions. In addition, he has internationally cast some of the finest actors. Ralph Fiennes is excellent in his subtle portrayal of Count Lazlo. Kirsten Scott Thomas is incredibly radiant, sensual and charming. She burns the screen with her appearance. While Juliette Binoche, who is equally amazing, beautifully shines like a candle in the dark. Willem Defoe is superb as the double agent turned tough avenger with a human heart. Colin Firth is outstanding as Katherine's pained husband as he speaks volumes with little word. Naveen Andrews is terrific and more than holds his own with his more experienced cast members. Minghella made one of the finest films of the genre and it belongs among my all time favourites. He has taken the ingredients required to make such a film and creates something that becomes a unique cinematic experience for the viewer. It is a film that can be analyzed in depth but no matter how many words I use, it won't be enough to describe the beauty of 'The English Patient'."

But equally, it traces the erratic and unexpected efforts of the different characters to find small interludes of peace in the shattering and unhinging progress of the war as it moves incomprehensibly towards a conclusion.<br/><br/>In writing the book, the author came to the story much as the viewer comes to the film. A little confused and not quite understanding what is going on. At all stages of the film, things happen which are unexpected and sudden, but whose effect is predictable and far-reaching.<br/><br/>But this cannot be the life of the author himself - because he was not born until after the war, of which he writes, was over.<br/><br/>And somehow this is the feeling that the film conveys. Rather like recollections from an actual childhood, which later come into focus the film takes us on an incredible journey which is overshadowed by the awakening recollections of the troubled individual from which it takes its title.<br/><br/>This a great film that takes us into a dangerous, unbalanced world where ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances struggle to make sense of their shattered lives and to find something familiar in their unfamliar surroundings."

","A viewer needs more than patience to sit through this tripe. The story is confused, the structure chaotic, the makeup ridiculous, and the photography poor.<br/><br/>An early scene in a troop-train appears to have no connection with anything that follows, except that it introduces a nurse, who is unidentifiable when she turns up shortly afterwards, because of the fact that (like many of the other characters) she is first shown some distance from the camera, in poor lighting. The identity-obscuring army dress doesn't help.<br/><br/>This ignorance of the basics of film-making is again evident when Kristin Scott-Thomas and Colin Firth appear. We see them near a plane some distance away, then when they come closer they are back-lit so that the viewer can't see their faces.<br/><br/>As I hadn't read the novel, it took me half the movie to realize that I was watching a series of flashbacks rather than, as I thought, mere switches of location. Part of the reason for this was that I was unable to identify the actor playing the English patient. The makeup was so extreme that the part could just as well have been played by Lon Chaney Junior or Boris Karloff. <br/><br/>A similar problem was evident in the scenes showing the pilot and his passenger. Presumably nobody on the makeup team had ever seen a dead body. Believe me, corpses do not look as if they have just come out of a beauty salon!<br/><br/>The plane was supposedly flying in a straight line, yet the position of the sun in several shots indicated that it was flying in various different directions.<br/><br/>To sum up, this movie was mess. Why it was praised by the critics is one of life's mysteries."

","I remember getting ready to watch this Best Picture Winner with a lot of doubts. The reason is because a while back they did an episode of 'Seinfeld' where Elaine is forced to go see this movie with her boss Peterman, and she almost dies of boredom. That being established, you can see how much skepticism I had towards this movie without even watching it. My mother, who had viewed the movie about two years earlier, kept telling me how great it was. So, I decided to suck it up and watch the film. I was kind of glad I did, but at the same time not so glad. 'The English Patient' is a great motion picture, but just like the 'Seinfeld' episode said it had the tendency to put you right to sleep.<br/><br/>First of all, the film is 162 minutes (2 hrs., 42 mins.) long. It didn't go by fast, in fact it felt like over three hours. However, as bored as I was with 'The English Patient' at times there was no use denying it was a great film. The cinematography and direction were beautiful, the dialogue was solid, the costume design and makeup were spot-on, and the acting was incredible with four strong performances from Ralph Fiennes, Kristen Scott Thomas, Naveen Andrews and the brilliant Willem Dafoe, and an absolutely extraordinary performance from Ms. Juliette Binoche which rightfully earned her an Academy Award in the 1997 Oscar ceremonies.<br/><br/>If you suck it up and decide to see 'The English Patient', I think you'll be able to greatly appreciate it. It moves slow, but the film is filled with such beauty and excellent qualities that in a way it doesn't matter. In other words, 'The English Patient' is a film you watch once and only once just to see how wonderful a motion picture it is. I would definitely NOT recommend watching it more than once, in fear it may result in a deep coma for the viewer. Grade: B+"

I adored the flashbacks, which was timely, and unrushed. Like good wine not to be gulped down quickly. Marvelous direction. I was a little disappointed in the relationship between Hana and Kip, not quite understanding what his standoffish manner at the end was all about.

I'm not saying the movie is bad, but its flaws are what I've pointed out above, and if a film has a good cast and acting but lasts much too much, loses most of its charm. Similar examples include Magnolia or Gandhi, being the latter one I haven't seen nor I think I ever will. Not that I am fond of shallow stuff, but I don't like seeing films that could be used as a cure for insomnia, either.

Their scenes before they *ahem* consummated their attraction for one another had less of flirtation and discovery, and more of two dogs in heat sniffing around each other.<br/><br/>It's telling that I have a window open with the cast listing so I could see what Laszlo's and Katharine's names were, because I just plain couldn't remember them.

"Mr Lombardo","5","1","4","9 May 1999"," Just a distant memory
","The one word that springs to mind in describing this film is 'indifferent'. It is beautiful to look at, just like Scott-Thomas, but also like Scott-Thomas at its centre it seems a cold-hearted passionless affair. Perhaps the main reason for this is that the grandiose love story is told through a series of flashbacks as the Fiennes character 'regains' his memory.  Minghella has opted to tell the story through memories, trying to induce the romantic notion of a timeless love by setting it in another land and another time.  We never actually meet Katharine Clifton, the aim of this probably being to create a woman unflawed by reality - a fantasy that exists only in our dreams.  The only purpose of the 'present day'  story seems to be to offset the flashbacks as ethereal and other-worldly.  This is where the problem lies - the flashbacks do come off as distant memories,  the sort of memories that bring a sad smile to your face as you remember something special but doomed but without reliving any of the strong feelings associated with the events themselves!  The photography and the music are exceptional but Minghella comes across as a David Lean wannabe. Everything about this film is understatement, and this was never a characteristic that could be associated with Lean or the classic cinema The English Patient aspires to be.  To just write off this film would be wrong - it does have many appreciable qualities, but a rip-roaring romance it is not.  Not that it was ever intended to be, but perhaps it should have been."

This movie gives hope to those who thought that the classic movies of the past were gone forever.  The movie is beautiful.  The actors are first rate.  I felt their passion.  Their heartbreak.  This is one of those rare movies that touches, not only your heart, but your soul, as well.  I now own the movie, and no matter how many times I see it, I can't help but cry.  There are a few scenes at end, that you will carry with after the movie is over.  I can't recommend this movie enough.  It is a must see for anyone who has ever loved.  Ralph Fiennes is one of those rare actors who convince you that he is his character, and not just reading lines from a script.  In fact, the entire cast makes you feel as if you are reading a personal memoir.  By the end of this film, you feel as if you have known these characters your entire life.

","Juliet Binoche will break your heart...and then return the pieces in a more beautiful whole. Her radiant performance as Hanna is simply the single greatest female performance of our time. She is asked to sustain human interest and a sense of both sadness and wonder. Her face does it all, and more. As the film flickers to her final goodbyes...the heart stops. You don't want the war, the sadness, the terror to end. Because with it will go the inspiration of a nurse who fought so hard to keep others alive, but had those closest to her die. She is the same nurse who commits the ultimate act of kindness despite her training and vows. Juliet's Oscar is a shining moment for Academy voters in recent years. They got it oh-so-right."

Kristin Scott Thomas is very attractive and always looked so fresh looking with beautiful clothes in this movie. I love Ralph Fiennes. He is such an attractive with those piercing, outstanding eyes. Juliette Binoche is very likeable in her part as the sympathetic nurse.  Keep a few hankies handy. I would like to have seen some extras on the DVD, such as a bit about the making of the movie, interviews, etc. but there were no extras.

","Previous comments have questioned the Academy's choice in this film, given its imdb rating and mediocre showing at the box office. But wasn't that the point. This movie was an adult themed, classically acted movie which was aimed at liberal, middleclass people between 25 and 40. This is a difficult demographic to attract successfully. The Academy is supposed to choose a film for its merit, not its popularity! Otherwise the whole thing becomes defunct. Also I think it has to be acknowledged that success and merit are not necessarily the same thing.<br/><br/>I am certainly not trying to contradict the other viewers opinions, I just think that they need clarification. 'The English Patient' was not 'Titanic', it didn't come stamed with blockbuster all over it. As to its IMDB rating, the film was one of the least seen Oscar winners in years, due to the reasons outlined above, therefore its mean average is lightely to be lower, although it is above the ordinary. Also as a forethought, this movie did better abroad than in the US, in Europe it was phenomenal due to Binoche, in the UK Fiennes and Scott-Thomas. Other popular European movies have low ratings because the majority of vistors to this site are english speaking and from the US<br/><br/>What Im saying is that it is wrong to categorise this, or any other movie, within the confines of any other, that is quite different to comparison.

The performances are wonderful, and the way the story weaves in and out from past to present, and from character to character, is amazing. In my case, the riches of this film weren't revealed on a single viewing, but I had to see it again years later. It's kind of like classical music, where you don't like it at first but after hearing it for awhile you appreciate the complexities of it and you start to appreciate your favorite pieces. Juliette Binoche is delightful, she seems so natural and relaxed that it's impossible to imagine that she is aware of a camera in the room filming her. And I think Ralph Fiennes's acting style suits this film perfectly; he's cold and distant through much of the movie, until the heart-wrenching ending when he returns to the cave. Anyone who doesn't cry when Hana is reading Katharine's dying words to the count must have a heart of stone."

It had some basic elements that were the same on both movies, such as strong character development and a romance in the context of war.<br/><br/>However, I felt rather bored viewing this movie as compared to Cold Mountain. I think Cold Mountain had far more interesting characters than this one, and I never felt board watching through it as this one. However, it had an excellent ending to the story, and overall it was an excellent story - just the pace was too slow and difficult to connect with the story. Perhaps it would resonate better with someone who was alive during, or just after that era (which to me is in the same boat as the civil war) since most of the positive reviews are from older audiences."

Having watched the film twice since then, however, I have come to appreciate the poetic dialogue as well as the amazing cinematography and score.<br/><br/>For me, Hana was the most sympathetic character in the film, marvelously portrayed by Juliette Binoche.  Her spontaneity, beauty, and passion illuminate the screen like no other actress today in such films as ""Bleu"" and ""Damage"".  During ""The English Patient"", she is the character I weep for as everyone she loves is tragically taken from her and yet, she still musters the courage to persevere.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those films that is too complex to comprehend in one viewing.  Because of this, I sincerely understand why many think it is overwrought and pretentious.  Therefore, I am reserved in recommending it to everyone.  The film is similar to ""The Piano"", another film that critics loved but that many viewers disliked for the same above-listed reasons. For those who do have the patience, however, a lush romantic story (with heart-warming quotations you will not soon forget), is a wonderful reward."

","Alot has been written here representing the opposing points of view on this film, with the more pro and pedantic expounding on the more subtle and enigmatic details behind the<br/><br/>canvas of the story.  Although I wasn't bored out of my skull while watching The English Patient, I will say most of the people who loved it and registered their comments here are perhaps of the type who feel cinema is trite unless emotionally isolated, performed by actors of the stage and produced in Europe.   We saw this happen previously when Howard's End won all the awards for being a smartly acted, beautifully detailed, and ultimately yawn inspiring experience.  The English Patient is much better, even entertaining in parts, but alas is nothing more than an expensive looking coffee table film everyone has to see and love when they fancy themselves intellectually enlightened  in the matter of high brow entertainment.  If you are not absolutely enamored with Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas you will not care to hang on to their every word in order to explore the depth of their love affair.  The most interesting character is the Nurse portrayed by Juliette Binoche, and it is through her screen time we find what meanings are more apparent, especially when she frees both her patient and herself from their respective physical and emotional tortures and leaves the monastery accepting of the risks and sacrifices love demands in order to know it.  An immaculate and interesting film...but in the end too unwilling to let the audience in."

","as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions in between. I for one think that is a good sign. <br/><br/>I always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I never watched Titanic for instance, and am not planning to).<br/><br/>The English Patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are 'home' (Katherine), it shows how destructive love can be in a slow, strong and utterly painful way, it excites because of the extremely passionate affair, the pain of the one(s) who leave behind, how pointless one can feel to move on. <br/><br/>The photography is just stunning, not to mention the play of the actors. The pace is slow, but timely, and that does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth/development of the characters. To put this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multi-layeredness of this movie. People tend to have difficulties with the pace of movies... as if they are in a rush to get to work.. hey - get a life ! ;-) enjoy...<br/><br/>one of the reviewers down here who doesn't like the movie a single bit says ""He [main character] is a map maker mapping the Sahara Desert."" well, the thing is, he isn't... it is kinda pointless to burn a movie to the ground if you can't get these simple facts straight.. <br/><br/>I give this movie 4.5 out of 5."

","Remember the Seinfeld episode wherein Elaine Benes proclaimed how lousy and slow this movie was? (""Why don't you just diiieee!"") Well, that was enough to prevent me from seeing ""The English Patient,"" until recently, that is. I finally decided to kick back and watch the film to see for myself if it was as bad as Elaine said it was (or as good as so many others contended).<br/><br/>First of all, the film isn't nearly as long as rumored; it's only two hours and twenty minutes (not including the end credits). Compare that to, say, ""Titanic"" which is almost an hour longer or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" which is an hour and a half longer.<br/><br/>Secondly, as long as one is psychologically prepared to see a drama/adventure flick and not an action film, the story sustains interest quite well. Some sequences are slow, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Needless to say, if you're a big fan of ""Armageddon"" -- essentially a two and a half hour trailer with its never-ending quick (and irritating) edits -- you will not like this flick.<br/><br/>One might criticize the ignoble and unfaithful character of the lead players. While this is understandable, I don't feel the movie justifies or glorifies their actions -- it's simply a story about REAL people with REAL flaws who make REAL mistakes (just like you and me) and must suffer the consequences. And suffer they do. Besides, there are some highly likable and noble characters in the cast, like Kip and Hana.<br/><br/>In light of the criticism of how long and boring this flick is, I was delighted to discover quite a few scenes filled with suspense, action and high-adventure. For example, the plane crash scene (the second one), the desert storm sequence, the bomb-about-to-explode episode and the fight-to-the-death in the train scene, just to name a few.<br/><br/>As many reviewers note, the desert cinematography is marvelous; in fact, the movie is worth seeing for this alone.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: ""The English Patient"" has elements of ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and ""A Passage to India;"" if you're a fan of the style, pace and realism of these movies then ""The English Patient"" is for you.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

","I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. <br/><br/>Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance.<br/><br/>There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'.<br/><br/>I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996).<br/><br/>The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. <br/><br/>The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more.<br/><br/>Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat.

","This movie based on the novel (1992) by Michael Ondaatje is undoubtedly one of the greatest dramas in the history of cinema. This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count László Almásy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fiancé in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called: The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack."

","Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was.<br/><br/>Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, ""the Father of History"". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep.<br/><br/>That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions.<br/><br/>Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. <br/><br/>The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish."

The story is very slow but based on performances it manages to somehow keep your interest level high. It is a love story but not in a normal sense. All the love parts are shown in flashbacks and what we see actually is the aftermath.<br/><br/>PROS: The beauty of the film no doubt lies in its editing pattern, but there were too many characters and all were properly analyzed. It never looked like they were focusing too much on the lead cast. Parallel to the main story we have a nurse who is struggling in different incidents in the present time and for the refreshing feelings we have the flashbacks in which I say Ralph fiennes is looking too cool. The film is a mix of a couple of stories with the main story holding all of them tightly. In all the film was not at all a waste of time.<br/><br/>CONS: Only thing that can come into mind after watching it is about the length.

","Once every five or ten years there is produced an epic, historical romantic tragedy, a movie of incredible beauty and emotional magnitude that tends to make a sweep at the Oscars, usually deserved. The late 80s and early 90s had been suspiciously devoid of any such movie. And then, all of sudden, a bunch of them came along at once. The English Patient sees such a grand romance with the elusive themes and complex structuring more often encountered in the art house.<br/><br/>It is not, however, dull or pretentious, possessing a directness and humanity that makes us feel somehow involved. Director Anthony Minghella does not attempt to dazzle us with any form of technical wizardry. His style is simple, thoughtful, with few camera movements. At certain times he places us right within the action, such as at the beginning of the first flashback, where the camera occupies the space of an imaginary extra person as the team discuss their expedition (this is a trick classic master Frank Capra also used, by the way). At other times, particularly in the 1945 scenes at the monastery, his camera looks down upon things, but the sense at these times is not one of cold detachment, but one of giving the characters some space and freedom at moments of high emotion, as when they bring the bedridden Count out in the rain.<br/><br/>The English Patient has practically an ensemble cast, with players of many different temperaments contributing something, and no-one quite seeming to be in a lead role. Although she won her awards as a supporting actress, Juliette Binoche provides perhaps the strongest presence throughout the movie. Her character is bereaved several times, and it's admirable how she manages to make the emotion seem genuine even in repetition. Together with Naveen Andrews and Kevin Whately she forms a warm, likable trio that viewers are instantly able to connect with. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas, the lovers of the primary story, are a sharp contrast. While both are physically very beautiful, there is a stiffness and formality about them both which, despite some wonderful efforts (Fiennes's drunk act is priceless), they never quite break out of enough to make their passion seem truly alive.<br/><br/>But perhaps this is part of the point. The English Patient is after all a picture of shifting tones. The scenes of 1945 depict a time for healing, mourning and rebuilding, and as such the only times where real human feeling is allowed to flow. Perhaps it is right that the dead romance of the past should be portrayed with a loftiness as of some ancient legend. Thinking in these terms, it becomes possible to see the movie for its all-round care in construction – the deeply-composed shots within the monastery that look like Vermeer paintings; the Walter Murch editing that seems cut together for harmonies of sound as much as image – a design in which even the style of acting performances is keyed into the dual storytelling. This is a picture in which the artiness and metaphor of highbrow filmmaking meet the grandeur and sentiment of the mainstream, to overwhelming effect."

","The quotation from Joyce's Stephen Dedalus came to mind while watching this movie about a handful of people living through the nightmare of World War II. The drama in this movie arises from the conflict between the personal and the political, between mass movement driven by global forces and the deeply personal matters of love, sex, friendship, and loyalty. While The English Patient is epic in scope, the story never wanders from its focus on this handful of individuals--a testimony to skillful writing and direction.<br/><br/>As often happens, sex and romantic love are subversive forces. In a scene in which a gathering of British troops celebrate Christmas and sing Silent Night and God Save the Queen, only one thin wall separates their piety from the passionate and adulterous lovemaking of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas.<br/><br/>The things that matter in politics and history are seen as labels. Ralph Fiennes plays a Hungarian count (though one who seemingly knows every American pop song ever written) yet is identified as ""the English patient."" Eventually the English come to believe he is German and imprison him. When he escapes and encounters German forces, he gives them his maps (thereby enabling them to infiltrate the British in Cairo and eventually attack them) out of desperation to save his lover. His loyalty to her is all that matters to him. Ultimately he is shot by Germans who think he is English.<br/><br/>It is a marvelous film, beautifully acted, written, directed, and photographed."
"Bolesroor","Null","0","4","25 February 2011"," Why Novels Should Be Read
","A good movie based on a novel should have the benefit of a clear back-story, and should be condensed down from the rich, layered characters and events that are the hallmark of great writing.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" has none of this. It's the kitchen-sink of motion pictures: every single plot line and detail from the novel seems to have made it to the screen, and it's unwieldy in size and over-reaching in scope.<br/><br/>Director Anthony Minghella seems to believe that he is telling a story of epic, Biblical proportions, which of course only serves to make the story LESS meaningful instead of more so. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas (who is luminous, and the best thing about the movie) play completely unsympathetic characters... whereas a great love story will make you want to know the couple this affair makes you want to get away from these people as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>What drives these two together? It wasn't circumstance, or destiny, or the insanity of war, it was lust in the dust- adultery for adultery's sake. Their relationship ""difficulties"" then become very difficult to care about. Willem Dafoe shows up in a plot line that goes absolutely nowhere, and Juliette Binoche is Hana, the saintly nurse who feels the need- out of all the thousands of soldiers she's treated- to personally attend to this char-broiled buffoon, for reasons entirely unknown.<br/><br/>It was about an hour and-a-half into the film that Indian minesweeper Kip ties Hana into a harness, arming her with a lit flare to illuminate the paintings on the walls as he lifts her high into the air. This was ridiculous, completely out of a place, and an insult to an audience that had already surrendered WAY too much of their time. I've also never seen a movie with more manipulative sound editing... effects are over-exaggerated and inappropriately loud, and the songs feel like a cheap device to elicit emotion.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" is an example of why novels are condensed and shortened for filming, why certain characters and plot lines are cut, why the story is simplified. This is a movie made to win awards, not to entertain audiences.<br/><br/>GRADE: C-"

From David's unfortunate fate in the torture room to Clifton's death wish vengefulness to Katherine's ultimate fate, the movie really drew me in. And Ralph Fiennes proves yet again he is one of the best actors working today, and likely one of the best in cinematic history. I try not to use hyperbole, but I think it's justified here. <br/><br/>The movie evoked memories of a number of great films, movies like Lawrence of Arabia and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It too achieved the epicness we often associate with them.

Anyone who had a slightly different name or a slightly surprising or uncommon attitude was at once considered as a spy unworthy of any trust. This created myriads or even legions of misunderstandings and human errors along with cruelty, barbaric acts, violence, etc. The only interest of this film is the technical brilliance in the use of flashbacks that only happen in the head of this English patient who plays the loss of his memory to protect himself against his own name and his own ascendants. Yet his survival is not possible and the nurse who is looking after him is little by little led to being convinced by him that she has to overdose him with morphine, which she does. The sentimental elements along the way for the nurse or the Sikh bomb and mine technician are there only to provide a present time line onto which the flashbacks can be woven and attached.

Sturdy in support is Kristin Scott Thomas, as Katherine Clifton, the passionate lover who stirs the Count's emotions to life. Juliette Binoche gives an Academy Award winning performance as Hana, the Canadian army nurse who cares for the critically injured Almasy as he gradually recalls the past. Ever reliable Willem Dafoe is Canadian undercover agent Moose, who blames the Count for a wrong he suffered during the war. Cast also includes Jurgen Prochnow, Colin Firth and Naveen Andrews.<br/><br/>The only disappointing part of this film is the shaky plot and lack of characterisation. Minghella's screenplay is never strong, nor is it important enough to be an epic. The characters are poorly developed and hard to empathise with. Not enough background is supplied to explain their actions and reactions. And another thing, I am getting tired of passionate love affairs that involve infidelity. Why is it that nearly all of cinema's great lovers are adulterous? Don't married couples love with vigour? Not according to the movies apparently. In ""The English Patient"", the lover is portrayed as the hero, and the husband as an obsessive, boring old sop. And that is just one of two affairs in the film. Add to that a plug for euthanasia, and immorality just is not in it. Hardly the picture of the year, though it does look like and epic.<br/><br/>Sunday, June 8, 1997 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema"

","Why does Count Laszlo De Almásy love so deeply with Katharine Clifton.It is very confusing. Is it because she is beautiful, or is it because she tells a funny story, or is it because he has been away from other women for too long? He knows for sure she has been married, but still falls love with her. This process cannot be stopped ,of course.We cannot condemn their love, but we shall consider about this.Why does he say it is the love without boundary?It is the hope.Actually,the boundary exists. In his inner heart,marriage is the boundary,nationality is the boundary. He is a German, but she is English.In the war,your nationality is important. He hates war and that's why he goes to Cario , the desert, as a person without nationality to find what interests him.The boundary keeps their love back, but in a larger sense, it deeps their love.The boundary is recorded in his book,which represents his heart and memory.At last ,the love of boundary vanishes,because she is dead and he is skin-burned.When the boundary is gone,his mind is full of bitterness.So sometimes, people feel good in love because their love has boundary.<br/><br/>I am touched by this movie,most because their love with boundary."
"cokramer","7","0","1","27 March 2007"," Not About Love Per Se
","The book is better than the film mostly because of the writer Ondatje's prose. Before I saw this film, someone who had seen it, told me the love depicted in this film isn't real. After seeing this film, I can see how her suspension of disbelief in this regard could've been distracting to other movie-goers as well. Frankly, some of the intense displays of love were laughable and seem to be on the edge of parody. But by the end, everyone should realize this is a big message piece of art. It is not specifically about love at all, it uses ""love"" to dialectically reveal the human divide or the arbitrary borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred. It is about misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us. The critical scene for the real theme of this movie is when the hero or antihero's pleas for help for his stranded lover in the desert is ignored and disregarded for the reasons shown in that scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, the hope epitomized in the interracial relationship between Binoche's recovering character and the Indian minesweeper (echoed in the Sikh's buddy-buddy relationship with his white coworker who ends up dying nonsensically) and the forgiveness epitomized in the Caravaggio character's first hunt and then forcing out of what he thinks will be the hero's confessions for his war ""crimes"" (betrayal of country). I think the film could've been made even better than it is. I don't know if a more realistic portrayal of the circumstances of love would've made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree this film is not about realistic romantic love, as the people behind this piece of art or film imply in an early scene when the eventual lovers first meet. The hero talks about how a new car, broken-down car, fast car, etc. (I'm paraphrasing) is still just a car no matter what adjective you put in front of it. She replies but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different kinds of love. This is ironic because this film is really about the one love all humans should want which is the love of (or for) peace (not materialistic things which are usually the real reasons for wars, epitomized in something most of us want such as ""cars"", let's say). Otherwise, we may be left stranded to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall art/drawings of swimmers, suggesting that the seas and life-supporting waters which were once there have all but disappeared. I believe ""The English Patient"" won the Oscar because of these big messages not specifically for its depiction of romantic love. Awards tend to go that way. The relationship of the hero and heroine was necessary to draw the audience in, unfortunately this view of love may be antiquated in the age of divorce and so many singles who can't seem to get together on so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythic love are hard to get into, even in daydreams, which film love has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The film may fall short of what people expect but a 7 out of 10 movie worth seeing, regardless."
"Hancock_the_Superb","8","0","1","24 December 2006"," Homage to old-school epic film making a la David Lean
","In World War II, a badly burned amnesiac known only as ""The English Patient"" is found in the African desert and is transported to Italy, where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers generally meet unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian soldier-of-fortune who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to settle.<br/><br/>Through flashbacks we learn the story of the Patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the late '30s, falls in with a group of British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton leaves them on government business, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, resulting in an affair that, naturally, has a less-than-happy ending.<br/><br/>If one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line (such as, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy?), then you can appreciate ""The English Patient"" as a throwback to the intelligent, layered, sweeping epics of David Lean in the '60s. Much more than ""Titanic"" or other epic romances of late, this movie puts one in mind of ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" - an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop. You shouldn't expect a war film, though there are some striking (if all-too-brief) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow) in particular).<br/><br/>The movie is very ambiguous, in regards to pretty much everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go for love? As critics of the movie are fast to point out, Almasy is, on the surface, a far-from-likable character - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the Germans, causing the death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and actually killing a British soldier who has him under arrest at one point. The fact that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is kind of the point - he's in love with Katharine, and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to country (or anything else for that matter) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates ""Ownership. Being owned."" The two engage in a rather bold love affair (shagging within ear shot of hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it's clear that Katharine is more drawn to the mysterious, exciting Almasy than the comparatively boring Geoffrey.<br/><br/>The 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely believable, and I feel the film could have done without it. But those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film, so I won't complain too much.<br/><br/>Like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes, strategically placed posters, and military presence. We do not need to dwell on the fact that it's 1938 in Cairo, but it's helpful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert cinematography by John Seale are absolutely gorgeous; the sand dunes, sand storms, and haunting caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's score is haunting and atmospheric.<br/><br/>The acting is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious, complex, and haunted. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the female explorer looking for adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes early on that he's no competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does nice work as Caravaggio, the shifty, hunted thief-turned-spy driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (and a similar character too): very brief, but more memorable then some of the major characters. Some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unremarkable. Kevin Whately, as Kip's ill-fated partner, does what he can with a rather smallish role.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"" is not a perfect movie by any means, but the vituperative attacks on it by much of the movie-going public are not deserved at all. Maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the Leans and Kubricks, or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand. Complex to fault, brilliantly directed and shot, ""The English Patient"" is a wonderful modern-day epic.<br/><br/>8/10"

","There have been several comments already on the site focusing on the ""prestige"" feel of the film - and there is a lot of heavy-weight talent on show: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to the magnificently rendered design and scoring, to the masterly direction. No wonder that Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for ""Evita"" at that year's Oscars began ""Well, thank God that ""The English Patient"" had no songs in it."" Writing of Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. It is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for Best Actor (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's hugely well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in ""Howard's End"" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of ""goodness"" involving, so Binoche's win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy. Her performance in this terrific film is a thing of beauty."

","After the recent death of Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Anthony Minghella (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Cold Mountain), it was right that this award winning film should be shown on TV, and I watched. Basically it is is World War II, and Count Laszlo De Almásy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fienes) is found near a plane crash in the Sahara desert with a hideously burnt face, but he has no memory of who he is, where he comes from, or any past. Hana (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Juliette Binoche) is the nurse helping him, and as more and more of his possessions are shown to him, he begins to remember who he is, and the love he once had. This is when we go into flashbacks to see Laszlo living his life not as an English man, he is minor Hungarian, but anyway, we see his growing love affair with Katharine (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kristin Scott Thomas), wife of Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth). Back in the present, there are some subplot stories, for example, the growing friendship, or more, with Hana and bomb disposal expert Kip (Naveen Andrews), and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who knows Laszlo from past experience. Towards the end, Geoffrey discovered the affair, and purposely crashed his plane in the desert, with Katharine in the back, and Laszlo saw this, and takes her to a cave, finding out that she is going to die (broken ribs). He promised to being back help, but the English take him prisoner, so he surrenders to some Germans by giving them some maps, and he gets their plane, and of course, he was too late to save her. In the present day, he dies of natural causes. A very good story, with a lot of thought provoking moments of war, love and survival. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Gabriel Yared, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Juliette Binoche was number 88, and Ralph Fiennes number 83 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Fiennes was also number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 56 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 60 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 15 on The 50 Greatest British Films.

","The sheer beauty of contrasts in lighting, all through the movie makes this movie a delight for the eye. The use of morning and afternoon sun, and dim lights is awesome. The framing itself deserves an Oscar, it's just pure beauty and blends well with the story. It sets the mood for the dialogue. A visual masterpiece in my humble opinion. Turn offs: the time warps sometimes disturb the flow, and a woman sleeping around. Overall, the story is good, dialogues above average, although not excellent. I personally think you'll remember this movie more by what you see than what you hear. Very well worth the time spent watching. Binoche saves the day in that movie, as others mentioned already, but on a visual point of view, many other experts also did a wonderful job. The music is plain so-so, no soundtrack to be expected ever from that one (rather cheesy if you ask me), music not up to par with the rest of the movie.

","Although the movie is well made, I'm not particularly fond of it.  When Juliette Binoche and Colin Firth are around we assist to the best scenes of the film, as they are both absolutely excellent, and truly Juliette Binoche holds the movie on her shoulders. I guess Ralph Fiennes is good too in a certain way, but I find he lacks subtlety and is often cold ( he doesn't have the delicacy of Colin Firth); he really is at his best when he has a lot of make-up and he cannot rely on his looks.<br/><br/>The photography is beautiful and I guess in a general way it deserved its Oscars (mostly because the other movies in contention where not very good either). But one of the major problem is the love story - which unfortunately is the plot line - between the count and Mrs Clifton.  It may appeal to some, but to me it's completely histrionic that she willfully leaves Colin Firth for Ralph Fiennes'character! Maybe I should read the novel to see how Goeffrey is described, but the way Colin Firth plays it, Mrs Clifton is a fool to walk on him.  Could it be possible that Colin Firth was miscast because he was too charming for the part? Surely, in the script, Goeffrey's character is not enough developped, but to me there is no real valuable reason why she needs to cheat on him, because she is not in love with the count, what ever happens between them is torrid sex! It's mostly a physical fling which is not justified to me.  Personnaly I would prefer a husband who could sing with humor in front of a bunch of people than  the guy who wonders all movie long how to call the little hole in the woman's neck!<br/><br/>I give it 6/10 because there are way too many scenes between the count and Mrs Clifton that don't make any sense to me and because the story in itself has not touched me enough.

","For some reason I remember seeing a lot of ads for this movie when it first came out, and though at the time of its release I failed to see it, I was always curious as to what it was.  Now I can't even remember what the other best picture nominees were that year, but in recent years I've begun to lose faith in the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, what with Shakespeare in Love, Gladiator, and A Beautiful Mind all winning.  I guess I wanted to see if The English Patient fit more with those movies, or if it was really deserving of the award, of all of its awards, like Schindler's List.<br/><br/>Usually I'm skeptical of romances--being a guy, I guess I can kind of see why.  One of the movie's I enjoy watching most with my friends is Commando, so you can see why a romance would not fit with the macho stereotype in which I locate myself.  There have been some good romances, to be sure.  I think the last really great romance I saw was Leaving Las Vegas, but that's too much of a downer.<br/><br/>Overall, The English Patient is a good movie, by some standards I would say it is a very good movie.  There are a lot of elements that come together to make it very enjoyable to watch.  For instance, the cinematography of the Egyptian desert is breathtaking, especially when the Ralph Fiennes character has to walk back to Cairo to save Katharine. Another element I found very affecting was the music--again look at the aforementioned scene.  Also, the Willem Dafoe character is very good--any character that sets out to get revenge but is not corrupted by it is a pretty good character.  All of these things make it nice to watch, but I can't say that it makes it a truly great movie.<br/><br/>For one thing, there are perhaps too many romances.  I can deal with one, but for Hannah to be continually plagued with ill-fated romances is asking too much from the audience--we've already got one to focus on.  Although, I think I was more convinced by the romance between her and the Indian bomb expert than by the Ralph Fiennes-Kristin Scott Thomas romance.  For the latter, it is hard for me to understand, and again this may be because I'm a guy, but the man Katharine is already married to is not a bad guy, not a bad guy at all.  And instead of him, she's attracted to the reclusive Ralph Fiennes, who becomes jealous of her and makes of fool of himself.  Am I supposed to feel sorry for her.  She's the one who left the good guy for the idiot--although the idiot does end up really loving her very deeply.<br/><br/>I guess it's a pretty good movie, but see for yourself.  It's just hard to get into a romance when its one that comes at the expense of a nice guy."

","Anthony Minghella's adaption of Michael Ondaatje's book scooped a hatful of Oscars in 1997 and attracted criticism for being `Oscar-friendly' and `conventional'. However, when film-making is as elegant and beautiful as this it is hard to argue.<br/><br/>All the performances are terrific but the stand-out is Fiennes' cold leading man driven to extraordinary lengths by his passion for Kristin Scott-Thomas. I found Minghella's narrative more cohesive than the book, but if it misses out anywhere, it is in the book's brilliant insights into the psyche of a bomb-defuser, which isn't really explored in the film.<br/><br/>Overall a rewarding watch for the discerning film fan. 8/10."

(i dont much trust the academy when it handles out loads of oscars, the debacles of titanic & gladiator spring to mind). i expected a pompous over-blown epic with little feel. how wrong, how wrong i was!!<br/><br/>the english patient is one of the most beautiful movies ive seen in a long time. the story unravels beautifully in layers, admittedly it is a bit slow, but the director has built up the atmosphere wonderfully. each and every character is well etched and totally totally believable. what a pleasant surprise in todays plastic hollywood!!<br/><br/>the acting is simply terrific, if i had to pick one person for an oscar from the movie, i would have chosen kirsten scott thomas, who ofcourse did not win it - frances mcdromand did for fargo - touch and go ... i would have gone with kirsten.<br/><br/>having said that, theres nothing to be taken away from any of the magnificient actors here - ralph fiennes, juliette binoche & naveen andrews & willem dafoe are all terrific. theres enough about the story in the other reviews, so i wont go into it.<br/><br/>the movie is truly magnificent, splendorous and worthy of the many oscars it won, especialy considering its competition. a grand romantic epic, in the lines of casablanca - a memorable movie whose only fault is its length<br/><br/>a splendid 9!!"
"hernan_amado","Null","0","1","23 September 2001"," A great Masterpiece
","I just can't say how incredible this movie is. This is one of the favorite movies I've ever seen. This movie won 9 academy awards, which are really well-deserved. I never thought it was going to be so incredible. When I watched it. I thought it was going to be boring or just lacking of interest, but not. I wasn't right. The performances in this movie were excellent. Hanna (Juliette Binoche) an academy award winner for best supporting actress. She was great as a nurse who took care of a very ill patient, in this case ""The English Patient, Almasy"" (Ralph Fiennes) who got an academy award for best actor in a leading role. I will always remind of the English patient Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) telling about his life and about his love after the first and second world war. The scenery was stunning as well. the desert in which the story took place was wonderful, the photography was flashy as well as the costumes. Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) an actress nominee for best leading actress in this movie, was great as well. She truly acted very well as Almasy's love and Axon´s wife. It wasn't based on a true story. However it really made me think of it as true, since the first and the second war actually happened. The most impressive part was as a person cut Caravaggio's thumbs off because he thought he was a spy person at that time. Another impressive part was as Katherine's husband died in a plane accident in which they were both in. Axon (Katherine's husband) flew up in anger because he found out about Katherine being in love with his best friend (The English patient. Lamasy). The plane crashed because of his wrath. When Lamasy saw Katherine very harmed. He left her in a cave and promised her to call doctors to heal her as soon as possible. He walked through the desert for three days without drinking anything. He finally calls the doctors with a lot of difficulty because some police thought he was german. But as he gets back to the cave where Katherine is. He realizes that she is dead. The English patient it means Lamasy reminds of it and also reminds of the accident he had with Katherine after taking her in a plane. Unfortunately the plane crashed too and Almasy burned his face and got very hurt. He remembers it with a lot of pain. He tells the nurse (juliete Binoche) about everything and finally past away. Hanna left for Florence to live with Caravaggio where she expects to be happy and meet her love again. it's really worthwhile. Don't miss it at all."

","I am not one to complain about movies.  In fact, I watch slow movies more often than not, but this movie is, quite frankly, somewhat ludicrous.  If you have yet to waste your time watching this Oscar movie--just proof that the award means nothing in the greater scheme of quality movies--I recommend that you try not to expect the obvious, yet drawn-out, scene around every corner.  Maybe this will allow you to enjoy it.  After seeing so many movies over the years, this film offered little to nothing.  If you like the film...Never mind.  I do not know what I could say to show you the light.  I did not offer one of the typical polarized votes found on IMDb, but the movie is not what so many people have said it is."
"JuguAbraham","7","0","3","14 September 2001"," Superb in some departments, below average in others
","After viewing a 9 Oscar winner, you begin to wonder how Hollywood thinks and rates a movie. <br/><br/>There are some aspects of this film where the Oscar was richly deserving: the intelligent editing, good music, good photography, a rich bouncy performance by Juliet Binoche, who was even better in ""Chocolat."" The opening sequences were absolutely breathtaking--was it a single shot? or beautifully edited to look like a single shot?   <br/><br/>How in the world this movie was rated better than ""Fargo"" the other film in competition, in other departments, I cannot comprehend. Does ""love"" for a woman mean more than giving war secrets to the enemy? Does marital betrayal get condoned? It is amazing that Hollywood sometimes chooses to reward subjects than filmmaking: ""Gandhi"" is an example. Here filmmaking gets appreciated but the content is rarely analyzed.<br/><br/>As for performances Naveen Andrews as Kip was striking; so was Kristin Scott Thomas (who gave a better performance in Polanski's ""Bitter Moon""). Both never won awards in this film.<br/><br/>In short this is a good movie in several departments--with lackluster direction and a not-so-uplifting subject."

","Hauntingly romantic flick by Anthony Minghella covers the late 1930s through to 1944. Two forbidden lovers with tragic endings. An all-round cast with poetic script and breath-taking landscapes are what make this a beautiful piece of art. Ralph Fiennes shines as the love-lorn Count Almasy and Juliette Binoche is charming as the innocent Canadian nurse Hana. Fine performances from Kristin Scott Thomas, Naveen Andrews, William Dafoe and Colin Firth. A must-see!"
"pbhowmick","Null","0","1","20 March 2001"," Strikingly beautiful love story with world war II in the back drop
","The reason why this film is so mesmerising is that it combines so many elements of a good story. There are 2 love stories, a spy plot, the platonic relationship between a nurse and a dying patient, revenge subplot, war time pathos and all these are enhanced by the beautiful landscape of the arabian desert. Any one of them could be stretched to make a movie. So when you get all of them together, its like a 7-course dinner, overtly sumptious and satisfying. The main plot is of the adulterous relationship between Ralphs Fiennes, an officer in the Royal Exploration Service during the colonial days, and Kristin Scott Thomas, his friend's wife. The subplot consists of another love story beween Juilet Bench, a nurse and Naveen Andrews, a Sikh minesweeper in the British Army. Though the 2 love stories are in different times, both of them unfold together as the film progresses. The main plot is brought out through flashbacks of the english patient, Ralph himself. The 3rd element which works in parallel is the relationship between Juliet and Ralph. Juliet who loses her dear one whenever she goes too close to them, struggles to keep her patient alive. There's one more subplot of Willem Dafeo's revenge, but that doesn't add to the story much. The film is beautifully shot. Its a visual treat for anyone who likes exotic landscapes. The acting, direction and background score are all good, but its the combination of these elements that has a synergetic effect to make this film so wonderful to watch. So I feel this film deserved the Oscar for best film, but the best actor and actress I'm sure went to someone more deserving."
"Figtree","Null","0","1","4 March 2001"," A great film, but better on big screen
","The English Patient has been one of my favorite films since it came out back in 1996.  I saw it twice while it was still in the theaters, and didn't watch it again until about a month ago on video.  I still loved it this time, but the intensity of seeing it the first couple of times was no longer there.  It is such a visually stunning film of large scope that it really needs the big screen to bring that out.<br/><br/>Despite some comments here that this film seemed overly long, it didn't seem that way to me.  It is romantic, and is devastatingly beautiful.  The acting is believable and quite intense.  It isn't recommended for those who are looking for a pleasantly light film to while away the afternoon or evening."

Since Iam Egyptian I have to say this comment Egypt's were not like this in the thirtys Ido think it was an impression taken from other movies which covered Egypt during this period which I think they should have depended on Egyptian's movies better which covered this period or even shot at that time.

","The English Patient will divide the film fans, some will hate it, some will love it. I think it's a super picture, very artistic. <br/><br/>The story, well, hmmm, there isn't a strong narrative or focus to the picture, it's kinda weird, some parts of the film do not have the meat, it seemed a bit inconsistent. The film is not about story telling, it's artistic directing, pieces of film put together. Sometimes the film lacks the cohesion, not always perfectly binding.<br/><br/>It's a tough film for me to review, but I assure you, if you are interested in film-making, one must study this picture.<br/><br/>The film is about love, deceit and adventure, I can't pin it down to one category.<br/><br/>The performances are superb.<br/><br/>The technical standard of the picture is extremely high, very reminiscent of David Lean. The photography is stunning, beautifully composed shots.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film even though it has a few problems in the narrative and character definition, I love it!!!

"C_Kivi","Null","0","2","17 October 1998"," Could have been much better
","The directing was poor.  Fiennes was strong, but the make-up severely detracted from the power of his performance.  He looked stupid, almost like Freddy Kruger.  They shouldn't have made the burns so bad, maybe on just part of his face.  Or if its crucial that he is unrecognizable, put him behind a curtain, or have a cloth over his face, this would make things more mysterious, as was the premise of the movie.  Fiennes has such a good voice, that they could easily pull that off and it would have been a much better movie, sometimes technology is worse.  The musical score deserved an Oscar, but it was never used.  The dramatic scenes in the cave and on the train seemed stale because there was no music riding your emotions.  Best of all in movie was the only one not nominated for an Oscar, Willem Defoe.  As Caravaggio, the spy whose thumbs were cut off, he brought the story back down to earth and let you know that Count Amasi sold out on the allies and a lot of people were hurt as a result.  His performance was outstanding."
"Pelagia","7","0","2","20 June 2000"," Beyond ""Emotion""...
","This is a film that makes a clear effort to present some sort of ""Casablanca for the nineties"".  It borrows the setting of the North African desert in the late 30's, a point on the distant fringe of a landscape beginning to taste the wrath of Nazi Germany.  Also apparent is the forbidden attraction between a single, unattached man and a married, respectable woman.<br/><br/>If there is any reason why so many movies, ranging from every genre, have been set in WWII, it is found somewhere in the metaphor of the outside turmoil, devastation, death, heartbreak, etc. in the grand scheme of the war as a reflection, or rather, an allusion to the same happenings occurring the the private personal lives of the characters.<br/><br/>Now, this is all good and well if you are searching hard to create some sort of mood, but it was all to certain that the filmmakers relied just too heavily on the atmosphere of the setting, letting it drive the plot instead of having the film focus on the personal lives of the characters.<br/><br/>The overall effect of the film is that is seems just too calculated, it reaches into a familiar routine that you may notice in many of the so called ""tear-jerker"" movies.  A horrible death here, a shocking suicide there, a forbidden this, an unabashedly sexual that.  And so on.  Watching the film, I felt bombarded by these various tricks and tactics that are used to make me ""feel"", to ""get emotionally involved"".<br/><br/>Of course, I am human, and consequentially I will fall prey to this and feel ""touched"" at various points in the film.  But nonetheless the film lacks that certain, indescribable something that defines the great classic films, including 'Casablanca'.  It is some sort of spontaneity in the acting, something uplifting, a performance, perhaps even one line, that sums up the world into the vision of the characters, that makes us believe in them. Something real.  Something that produces more than just ""emotion"", but rather wonder (a word that needs no quotation marks).<br/><br/>Isn't that what real romance is about?"
