"Kitsfi","8","212","252","28 September 2018"," Keanu gets pissed and shoots people in the face for 101 minutes*
","John Wick has a very simple, maybe even laughable plot. It is a typical guy takes his revenge movie. It can be easily summarized as ""Keanu gets pissed and shoots people in the face for 101 minutes"" but the thing is you actually can see it is really Keanu who is doing it. Instead of shaky cameras and dozens of superfast cuts, you can see kick-ass long takes which are amazingly choreographed. Since this is their first film, the director duo has a few problems with storytelling but I am glad that they made me realize how much I miss watching an action movie and actually see what's going on."

","It's hard to find anything bad to say about John Wick. The action is beautifully choreographed, the setup is surprisingly emotional for an action flick, and Keanu.... What more is there to say? If you love action or even just like it you will be in for the ride of your life."
"lnvicta","8","432","592","6 May 2015"," Kinetic, concise, and stylish; John Wick kicks ass.
","The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.<br/><br/>As an action movie buff, all I wanted to see in this movie is some inventive action sequences, and I was not disappointed. Every single action sequence in this movie is fast-paced, beautifully shot, fluid, intense, and you never have trouble understanding what's going on. The direction of this film is fantastic, as is the writing. There's no melodramatic soapy story lines - everything is straight and to the point, and the point is to get to the action. Not one moment in this movie is boring. The short dialogue is effective from getting to action sequence A to sequence B without any confusion as to any character's motive. It's all laid out in front of you - all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the insanity happening on screen.<br/><br/>Remember when Live Free or Die Hard came out and people were upset that John McClane only fired pistols throughout the entire movie? I like a little versatility when it comes to action heroes, and evidently so do the writers. John Wick wrecks face with pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, knives, even mano-a-mano; the man can do anything. The difference between John Wick and other modern action movies (Die Hard 5 and Taken 3 for instance) is that you actually believe John Wick is killable. He's not some invincible superhero like Bruce Willis was in Die Hard 5, having his car crash and flip like a hundred times and the second it stops he gets out without a scratch and starts running. No, John Wick takes a beating in this film. Numerous times in fact. But most of the time he's kicking ass and taking names, and instead of acting as some unstoppable killing machine, he just seems like a guy who's an expert in his field. He used to be a hit-man after all.<br/><br/>John Wick is a blast to watch. Really, it's just a mindlessly fun action movie. It has large-scale shootouts, CQC sequences, and a classic hero-villain hand-to-hand confrontation at the end. The only negative I can say about the movie is that the villains aren't anything to write home about. They're Russian mobsters which we've seen a million times, and their leader isn't given enough to work with as far as character goes. Willam DaFoe has a brief but important role though as Wick's former colleague. <br/><br/>Regardless, John Wick is all about the action and it goes above and beyond in every respect. It's a breath of fresh air after all the poor sequels we've been getting, and thankfully John Wick has the potential to be the next great action franchise. An absolute must-watch for action fans."
"CountJonnie","7","318","449","17 January 2015"," Story: 3 minutes; Entertainment: 101 minutes.
","It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies. Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren't present here.<br/><br/>Nothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending.<br/><br/>And for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>If you're tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call."
"ivo-cobra8","10","159","234","19 November 2015"," The best action revenge film of all time from 2014 so far!
","John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!<br/><br/>Old school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I've ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I've never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don't know what the body count is, but it's gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don't see that that often in films. It's got an all star cast of cameo/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that ""Mayhem"" Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. ) <br/><br/>I Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team's covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven't seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie! <br/><br/>The last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy's death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded. He wasn't a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded. Keanu Reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in Knock Knock (2015) I only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first was.<br/><br/>When sadistic young thugs senselessly attack John Wick (Keanu Reeves)-a brilliantly lethal ex-assassin-they have no idea they've messed with the wrong guy. With New York City as his bullet-riddled playground, Wick embarks on a merciless rampage, hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend That is the main plot the rating I am giving this movie is a 10/10 because It deserves it."

","Keanu Reeve is John Wick. He's a deadly and unstoppable hit-man, and it shows. ""John Wick"" is short and to the point, but so much fun. At 1 hour and 36 minutes running time, there is never a dull moment in what may be one of the best action films of the year. <br/><br/>The film starts off quickly and never stops. It doesn't spend too much time on the backstory or development of Wick's life, yet it still succeeds so well in building up his character. Within the first 20 minutes, John Wick is called out of retirement when three robbers break into his home, steal his car, and kill his dog. Even before the action begins though, the film builds up so much suspense and gravity into who this ""John Wick"" is, resulting in a satisfying and exhilarating moment when his enemies realize he's back in the game. <br/><br/>While the plot may be simple and straightforward, it works sufficiently in setting up a situation where the rest of the greatness can happen - stylized and awesome fight sequences where John Wick goes through dozens and dozens of kills. Seeing this in digital IMAX really helped boost the mood of the film; the intense sound design and visuals, the slick fighting and choreography on screen. There's this one scene in the film where John Wick assaults his way through a club, and all those elements combined make it an absolutely incredible sequence to witness. <br/><br/>Besides John Wick and his fighting, the film does set up a very interesting world, thanks to all the other little details and characters it brings in. There is an organized system of those on the other side of the law, operating and exchanging ""gold coins"" while staying at bases such as ""The Continental"" hotel; this definitely allows room for sequels and spin-offs. <br/><br/>Still, Keanu Reeves is the star of the show, and this is the best I have seen him in quite awhile. Again, the story is straightforward and audiences know what emotional journey to expect, but Keanu displays a good amount of range in his portrayal of Wick that is still nice to see. Just like his character states, I'm thinking he's back. ""John Wick"" is an awesome and enjoyable action flick that I would recommend. RATING: [8/10]"
"Voeim","7","155","247","11 November 2014"," Manly action film
","Lesson learned: don't get on retired legendary hit-man John Wick's bad side. In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick's style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn't have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him. <br/><br/>If you're planning on seeing John Wick because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines, then you're going to be disappointed. If you are looking for raw well- choreographed action and machismo, then look no further. House Greyjoy's Alfie Allen stands out as villainous Russian mafia brat Iosef Tarasov, and Michael Nyqvist (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) plays Viggo, his mob boss father. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed John Wick as a pure action film. It doesn't have a storyline like The Matrix or Speed, but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action. This movie is manly and primitive, and proves that at the age of 50, Keanu Reeves can still mix it up as an action star."
"trublu215","9","629","1063","20 October 2014"," The coolest action film you'll see all year
","At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well."
"potablepictureshow","9","281","470","19 December 2014"," Keanu Brings a quiet believability to this action throwback
","John Wick had been out awhile and at first I had little interest in seeing it as, for me, Keanu Reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is. However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.<br/><br/>The movie had two ex-stunt men (one of which was Keanu Reeves' former stunt double) helming this film. This resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen. Also familiarity with Reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star. This left the film's action scenes clean, realistic, to the point, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>If I was going to break down the film's format, well it is of the ""semi-generic Punisher type, ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses"" type variety. It was 75% Japanese yakuza film, 20% Film Noir, and 5% video game. One stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus. At first I thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then I realized it was a choice made for the film. Normally this would annoy me slightly, and I suppose still did, as I am a big fan of depth of field, miseâ€“enâ€“scÃ¨nes set ups (Citizen Kane is one of my favorite films). I came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of Eastern influences, in this case it was reminiscent of Zen ink and brush compositions, where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effect.<br/><br/>While Keanu sold the action pieces well, he wasn't asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range, which is just what the film required. He was pretty much perfect for this part if I had been for some reason been asked to recast this film, I would be hard pressed to find a better fit. This would have been right up Jason Statham's alley, however there is nothing more he could have added to it. There was something quietly instance about Reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with. Statham will always remind me of the character he played in Snatch, which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating. Rather, if I had my choice of an alternative, I would delve further into the Japanese gangster genre and extract Chow Yun-fat. Reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker. Chow Yun-fat would have been ten years older, but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the 'business'.<br/><br/>Speaking of performances, this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise. One of these performances that I was not overly fond of was that of Alfie Allen. You probably know him as the dickless Theon Greyjoy. He worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable, however I was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to. This brings me to another flaw of the film. Many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the John Wick challenge. A spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself, an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded John Wick killing stroke.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action. This easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014. Judged as just a movie, it is simple in story structure, but what it does it does very well.<br/><br/>Blarv Score out of 10: 8.8"
"James_De_Bello","8","174","289","23 January 2015"," 8/10
","The only word that keeps coming back to mind when reviewing this movie is: exhilarating. The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!<br/><br/>First and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, ""John Wick"" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn't, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn't shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you're rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single f***ing kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn't enough, ""John Wick"" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Despite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn't original, stylish or innovative enough to say: ""we've seen this plot before, but not quite done this way"". Yes it has its brilliance, but it is kind of cheesy, even if in a good way, and predictable. It doesn't rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straight-forwardness. It does have some stakes, but all in all there isn't really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkable.<br/><br/>Obviously, that is not what it's aiming for and because of that I could recommend this movie to anybody, just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater!"
"IceSkateUpHill","10","446","783","22 October 2014"," Smoothest action film to come around in a long time
","John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare."

","Based on the reviews I read in here, I was expecting much more from this movie. Yes the movie is action packed, but very much over done. Certainly not a quality movie by any means, with a weak story line. It was like being in an action game where the lead had unlimited lives....he is invincible no matter how many times he is shot! There are assumptions that we will understand the rules of the ""committee"", but these are never explained and we are left with very few answers the end. In light of the over the top and often excessive violence and killings, I must say Keanu Reeves' performance is the only highlight of the film. Overall however, a very weak story with unnecessary and excessive violence, and a plot that is more suited for a PlayStation game."

","John Wick is one of those few movies a year that seemed like it would be absolutely terrible, but when you finally sit down and watch it, turns out to be incredible. Not only is it one of the most fun films of the year, but it's so much different than the action films we have today. It doesn't try to be inventive or over-the-top, it just plays to it's strengths.<br/><br/>I have never been a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. Even in The Matrix, which is a great film, his acting falls pretty flat to me. He hasn't showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen. But as John Wick, he's perfect. The role doesn't call for anything more than just being a likable bada**. Wick is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort. He finally feels like he get's closure with his wife and then it's all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with. He goes on an absolute killing rampage. To say the body count adds up is an understatement. Wick goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him, but it's not exactly easy for him. Being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty, well Wick is definitely that. That's one of the many things I appreciated about this film. It never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger. Sure he effortlessly kills plenty, but he also struggles with a few as well.<br/><br/>Killing a cute little dog would tick off anyone, so I don't blame the character for being mad, but I'm not sure there needed to be this many deaths. There are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of Wick. At times, it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film. But I really loved all of John's interactions with people from his past. They all seem to be as surprised that Wick is killing again, as we are that this film turned out to be good. I thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in Wick's apartment, go. Alfie Allen plays the main villain, and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of Game of Thrones. He's constantly under-appreciated and so he wants to prove himself, but ends up doing something terribly stupid. It was also nice to see Bridget Regan from Agent Carter briefly pop up.<br/><br/>But besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high, the film is just awesome. The 'Drive' sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride. Keanu Reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles. Just don't try and do too much.<br/><br/>+Stunts & action <br/><br/>+Score/soundtrack <br/><br/>+Reeves makes it believable<br/><br/>+Villains aren't stupid <br/><br/>-Body count <br/><br/>-Weak script <br/><br/>8.4/10"

Yet, armed burglars get inside his house and take him by surprise without any resistance from him.<br/><br/>But wait, he is a ghost, a shadow-man ... yet when he doesn't have a gun, he might as well put on a t-shirt that says 'piÃ±ata' because even lamers are beating the crap out of him all the time.<br/><br/>But wait, he is fast, he is ruthless and he is on a revenge mission ... yet rivals keep slipping out of his hands, he can't shoot anything unless the target somehow presents itself two feet from his pistol and he needs to be continually rescued by his only true friend who ""our hero"" doesn't give a damn about.<br/><br/>I think what failed this movie, for me, was the script.

","Wow what a great surprise this was. I was told by a friend this was good but it's been awhile since I liked a Keanu movie so I was hesitant to try it. Retired hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) loses his wife to cancer. After her funeral he receives a puppy she left him. A few days later some thugs, led by the son of a Russian gangster John used to work for, break into John's house. They beat him up, take the keys to his beloved car, and kill the puppy. They did this not knowing who he was; they just wanted the car. Now John Wick is out for revenge and the Russian gangster is trying to save his son's life by sending killers after John.<br/><br/>Keanu's great here. Glad to see him doing something watchable again. Willem Dafoe, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick lead a good supporting cast. Michael Nyqvist was made to play villains. Even Adrianne Palicki was good. Oh and hey the beat-up guy from the Allstate commercials is in this. The stuff with the hotel for assassins and the way they all know each other was pretty funny. About the only problem I had with it was the unrealistic scene where the bad guy finally gets the upper hand on the 'hero' and doesn't kill him. This sort of thing is common in movies but it's always unbelievable and reminds me of the old James Bond villains. This is easily the best action movie this year. Possibly the best straight action movie since the first Taken. English-speaking action movies, that is. It doesn't reinvent the genre or anything but it's entertaining."

","I know it is too late to warn you not to go see this movie. But still, I am writing this review to express my disappointment, and to say I have no idea why this movie can be rate 7+ here. There must be something wrong.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Keanu. And I do not mind action movie with simple plot, as long as it looks cool. Nevertheless, I was brought down big time. <br/><br/>The plot is unbelievably ridiculous. It will leave you amazed, wondering if whether someone pro-read the script before they made it a movie. No twist, no surprise, no character development, nothing thrilling or exciting whatsoever. It is utter boredom. I felt intelligently insulted, to be honest. <br/><br/>And the action does not look cool either. Seriously, if you expect something like, let's say, Taken, you will be massively disappointed. John Wick does not really fight. He shots randomly, move randomly, and grunts, and moans. Nothing else. Everything cool about him is what you heard the others say before the fighting starts.<br/><br/>I hope this review can actually reach someone, and help to stop them from wasting their time watching this movie.

"mbor1800","2","256","504","31 October 2014"," It does not feel like action film but more like a comedy
","First of all, there are obviously two versions of this movie, as reviews sway from ""top notch"" straight to ""low bottom"", deadly missing the golden average. I watched the second version. The movie ""John Wick"" exploits the idea of bad Russians, and how they are put in place by a retired hit-man (John Wick). The plot is extremely straightforward and would be easily fit for a video- or a computer game without any changes. There are no intriguing twists or any interesting supporting characters. Humour is absent completely, but for one small joke. Plenty of music, which has good tempo but a bit loud, as if movie-makers tried to compensate for bland taste with high decibels. <br/><br/>The mobsters are very well portrayed as degenerate half-wits with very basic vocabulary, making one to think that they really should be put in prison for mentally-challenged rather than brutally shot-up, quite frequently right in their silly heads. Speaking of which â€“ shooting scenes are reasonably well orchestrated, but when it comes to hand combat, for some reason characters would forget karate, jiu-jitsu, kung-fu etc., and instead resort to classic wrestling which looks comical to me. All-in-all, I caught myself looking at the watch anticipating when the digits 23.00.oo appear. That's how interesting this movie was. And I do not understand why Keanu Reeves walked into this one. <br/><br/>********************FUTHER TEXT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*******************<br/><br/>Just one thing â€“ all killers/assassins in the state of New York know each other very well. The do not hide under false names in some forsaken motels/bungalows. No. They live large and, judging by John Wick, for years have been re-elected as local hit-man of the year. They also have this secret hide-out that happens to be a luxury hotel with all the perks, except a swimming pool on the roof-top (coming next year?). And they use this secret currency in a form of special coins (goodbye US dollar) that are so unique that no one can churn out a thousand of them per hour using basic stamping machinery and ruin their fragile assassin economy. Yeah. On top of everything police, FBI, CIA, and even NSA (now without Mr. Snowden, but still running strong) have no idea what is going on under their noses in the middle of New York. This was the moment the movie turned from bad action into bad comedy for me."

","This is one of those movies that makes you get out of the theater and you want to kick someone. It's full of action, no excessive drama, no background history asides from the fact that everyone has to be scared of John Wick just by pronouncing his name just like ""The Boogieman"". <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, no expressions, no feelings, just a couple of lines and shooting a lot of bullets, very precisely by the way, the real acting is on the hands of Willem Dafoe (sort of). Alfie Allen is kind of on the same role as the one in Game Of Throne, sorry but I have to say it, I watched him and can't stand thinking about how he's useless here too.<br/><br/>For an action movie I really like this one... and I'm thinking who's better John Wick or maybe Bryan Mills?"

I would've just put 3 shots into his head. john's friend violated the code by helping him when he said he's gonna kill him and he was ratted out by a female assassin, but that earned her death, wtf? what did she do wrong? john's friend violated the code, why can't he be ratted out? I don't even know why the directed bother to give the bad guys a chance, why don't they just bring back neo and keanu can just off them all with his mind and the movie will be 5 seconds long. oh by the way, keanu can't act, i can grab any random people on the street, and chances are they'll be at least as good."

"theedeepwood6","9","30","53","23 February 2015"," Surprised!
","2014 has not been the best year for movies. There are many movies like this one, shoot em up type of things. The expendables was one of them, and from the previous 2 films, this one did not excite. All 3 of them in my opinion are terrible. Many of these types of movies are terrible, with the plot being too cliché or unable to make sense with, or it is too unrealistic. This movie was much different.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer I was happy to see Keanu Reeves back, for he had not come out with many things since the Matrix. Then I realized what the movie consisted of and my emotions changed quick. I went to the theater hoping it was at least better than the expendables or any other movie that is like that, but it was entirely different. The plot i admit was cliché, and the fact that John Wick could kill that many people and survive is a little ridiculous, but the movie is very enjoyable! The actions scenes are amazing and very fun to watch. Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, and this is probably going to be a reboot to his career. He does not disappoint in this movie, in fact, this is in my opinion his best acted movie. If this movie didn't have good acting in it it would not be as good. There are some flaws to the movie as in any other, but I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year. <br/><br/>This film is rated R, and for a reason. There are an occasional F bomb, and no sexual themes in it. The movie is rated R for violence. There is some blood spray when people are being shot, or from being beaten. There are also some mature thematic material in the movie involving the death of his wife due to I believe is cancer or some other disease, and the brutal murdering of his dog that was given to him by his wife. Now take note that the movie revolves around the dog and john getting revenge on the people who killed it. I would strongly recommend not showing this movie to anyone under the age of 14.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is excellent. It doesn't take much thinking to watch, but definitely excites. If you love movies, GET IT ON BLURAY. 9/10"
"vizkty","9","49","92","19 January 2015"," Good movie, worth a watch
","Interesting action movie. What i really liked about it is that lack or normal exaggerations in the movie continuity. John does NOT shoot 100 bullets from a handgun without reloading, he does NOT fight for 20 minutes with the bad guy at the end and he does NOT have superhuman powers (like flying through windows, dodge bullets or fall from 50 meters without repercussions). Yes, it's a bit brutal (90% of the guys get shot in the head), but it's exactly what i would expect in real life if a person like Wick would really exist and would go rogue. Besides that, some clichés, some cars miraculously exploding (i think the only thing which was really amateurish made in the script) and the normal lack of story in a bang-bang-shoot-don't-look movie. But, at least Wick goes after the bad guys for killing his dog, not the woman he loved (like in most of the others). <br/><br/>Overall, 9/10 to watch, 4/10 to watch again."

","John Wick disappointed on several levels. I probably had too high expectations, but the ""one-man-army/revenge"" concept has been done so many times before and done much better than this. The movie is rather boring - no real story here, and the characters aren't very interesting. The action scenes are mediocre and too much ""over the top"". The whole thing just gets really tedious after a while.<br/><br/>The revenge concept needs to generate sympathy from the viewer, and we need to be interested in seeing the revenge getting carried out. This movie didn't manage to do any of that for me. I was surprised to read quite a bit of positive reviews of John Wick, and a metascore of 68 was also surprising. I'm normally in line with at least the IMDb score, but this time I can't find much in this movie that warrants more than a 4.0 rating."

I have seen so many films that just don't capture the viewers eye, this movie keeps the viewer glued to the screen in till the end. It also ends of a cliffhanger which I always find is best. <br/><br/>Keanu was a great choice for this role, he plays a hit-man with ease, but there is always a little spark which he puts into his acting which makes him stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>All in all 9 out of 10.

"dramafreak42","8","23","40","27 February 2015"," Hard Hitting Action
","Whether or not you are going to enjoy this movie depends entirely on what it is you hope to get out of it. I fear for many it has been over-hyped, or just the high rating on the page leads folks to expect more than the movie is actually trying to sell. What it's selling is extremely well done action, and if you're content with just that then it will deliver in spades.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays the retired super-hit-man John Wick. He's pulled back into the world he left behind when the arrogant and ignorant son of a mob boss roughs him up for kicks (it's a little more personal than that, but I don't want to spoil it.) This sends John on a rampage through an underground world of mafia figures and hired killers. It really is that simple.<br/><br/>While the plot is as bare bones as it gets, there's a surprisingly deep world being built. It's a world in which there is a hotel specifically set up for hired killers to whole up in while they're on the job. It's a world where a body clean up crew is just a phone call away. It's a stylized world to be sure, but it's an intriguing one as well. It also helps that it's populated by some recognizable faces. Just the casting of folks like Ian McShane, Willem Dafoe, and John Leguizamo turns what are fairly thin characters into something that works. Many of the actors bring a certain caliber just by their presence that makes this world work.<br/><br/>But really, you're here for the action. And it's stellar. Firstly there are wonderfully long takes, no rapid cut trickery here. You know exactly what's going on and where everything is. And I personally LOVE the fighting style that John uses. While he appears to be a decent shot, his tactic is to get in close and then pump his target full of bullets. It's actually been a long standing pet peeve of mine that in so many action movies, the bad guys (especially henchmen) go down with a single bullet to some unspecified part of the body. John Wick is a professional, and he takes no chances. Even one of the innumerable body guards is going to get three shots to the gut and two to the head, just so John can be certain that he doesn't have to deal with that person again. It's fast, it's efficient and it's thrilling.<br/><br/>The film loses a little big of steam towards the end. The natural climax of the film happens with about 20 minutes left to go, and the final action scene isn't as thrilling or as poignant as it wants to be. That said it's not a deal breaker, and the action scenes that come before the climax more than make it worth going through the slightly weaker ending."

","I got to go to a press screening last night! The movie is brilliantly paced, with fantastic (nonshaky cam) action that all feels fresh, new, innovative and unique. Had the theater gasping through each action set piece. the main character despite his unique skill set is very relatable. Keanu was at the top of his game and the director used Keanu's strengths and didn't bring up any weaknesses. Also Don't WATCH any more than the first trailer because I thought it spoiled a major part of the first act MINOR SPOILER ALERT (but was mentioned in the trailer so it shouldn't be a spoiler) the fate of his dog is revealed and would be better not knowing it going into the first act of the film. The supporting cast was great, except whenever i saw the State Farm guy (Mayhem), it took me out of the movie a little bit. But the film brings me right back in! I can't wait to see this again! It doesn't necessarily need to be seen in theaters but any movie is better in the theaters. The most surprising thing about the movie is how funny it is. i found myself grinning and laughing along with the rest of the theater throughout. Yet it doesn't drown out the Intense Drama that is the sturdy shell holding the movie together smoothly. The world that was set up was done perfectly and even though i don't want a sequel i would definitely see one either set in same universe or continuing the story arch from this movie. However the movie does stand on its own two feet as one that has a conclusive ending. The only flaw i found leaving the movie was that the dialogue at the end was a bit muffled. but this was a test screening so i'm sure that will be fixed by the time the movie is released. So for that i give this movie a 9.5/10 and recommend this to pretty much anyone with a like of action movies (yes even if you're female you will still enjoy this movie at least for the first 2 acts)"
"aunggebi","7","31","57","30 January 2015"," Nice to see Keanu again.
","It is B level action movie. You can easily remind of other movies like this. Equillibrium, District 13, The transpoter and many other action movies with handsome, heroic guy. <br/><br/>Keanu fights usually with guns in this movie. But it brings more body action into the shooting scenes, so it becomes more stylish. Great to watch it at home, not boring at all, if you don't expect something like 007 series with Daniel Craig or Born series. Keanu kept his face and body almost perfect, so he is still handsome and fit, good enough for the film like this. But the enemies have less impression. They are fine but not new, bit similar to villains from 90's action movies. I recommend this movie if you are looking for something easy and fun, and you've already watched every other great action movies like Born Ultimatium or 007 Casino Royal."
"Rob_Taylor","7","24","43","25 January 2015"," Mindless, enjoyable, violence...
","I think part of the reason that I enjoyed this movie so much was that yesterday I watched Taken 3. That action movie was such a steaming pile of ineptitude that it makes John Wick look like Shakespeare in comparison.<br/><br/>John Wick has its faults. Believability being the obvious one. But it believes in itself just enough to carry it off and not descend into farce, though it skirts that point very closely at times.<br/><br/>One of the big draws for me here was the fight choreography. Plenty of thought went in to the extended action sequences and there was some imaginative use of the surroundings. Add to the fact that the shots are held long enough to let you see what is going on and the action is thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>There is plenty of violence and plenty of blood. Though not overly graphic or gratuitous, it doesn't shy away from it either. There are bodies, and blood, galore after every shoot out.<br/><br/>It is difficult to describe the level of the action here, but the thing it most closely reminded me of was the ""gun kata"" motif from Equilibrium. If you liked that movie, then the general flow from one target to the next that Wick performs here will be immediately familiar.<br/><br/>Story-wise, it is a simple revenge tale and the reasons for the warpath mentality of Wick are spelled out in the first twenty minutes or so. After that it is all action, pretty much.<br/><br/>If the action had been done badly (a la the aforementioned Taken 3) or the fights hadn't been interesting, then this would have been a tedious bore-fest. But thankfully, all is well in that department and, as a result, the movie is enjoyable. Repeat viewing... maybe not so much. But I can think of many worse movies to sit through a second time.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Imaginative fight scenes elevate this above many similar action movies. Simple plot and larger than life characters. Well worth a watch and can probably be considered as Hollywood's answer to movies like The Raid."

","Keanu Reeves gives us the best b-action flick in the longest. <br/><br/>Don't even know the last time I saw a movie like this on the big screen (feels like a Straight-to -Video type of film). Reeves plays John, a grieving widower who days after burying his ill wife gets carjacked by Russians who kill his dog( a gift from his dying wife). This was the event that spark what would be ninety mins of non stop mindless action. <br/><br/>Ironically, Reeves does a great acting performance as a man focus on nothing but vengeance, and he gets it with the best gun play and violence the western cinema could possibly give us, but I expected noting less from the actor who directed The man of Tai Chi just a year ago. His love of Asian action films is reflected in this picture. Keanu is no Chow Young Fat, but he's an impressive runner up with this film.<br/><br/>The movie had a similar quality to Denzel Washington's The Equalizer, but since Ted Theodore Logan does not have the acting chops of the great Denzil, the movie has to rely on choreographic style, something that Keanu has been good at since The Matrix. The action flowed like Neo was Fred Astaire<br/><br/>It was an action spectacular, filled with guns, fights, car chases, hot girls (like Adrianne Palicki as a hot girl with a Gun) .

","If you took this movie back in time 30 years, it would still be a bad movie. There are two story lines here; my review of the movie and how this movie got a 7.9 IMDb rating.<br/><br/>First the movie. There was a early moment in the theater when I thought maybe this is all a gag, a clever gag. Kinda like those mini feature spots reminding you to turn off your cell phone. They do a nice job on some of those in theater messages. Perhaps this will evolve into a Djangoesque tongue in cheek graphic novel. All this critical analysis language doesn't belong any where near John Wick. On location the actors must have looked at each other and said...really? Or maybe, my agent said we are supposed to shoot a movie today. Any movie fan with an eye for action movies will notice the poor fight scenes. I counted 6 identical fight moves straight out of the 70s cop shows on TV where somebody is flipped over using one arm and a throw. Every fight scene was the same fight. Movie audiences have evolved quite a bit since the 70s. John Wick is predictable, it's heartless, it's painfully slow with no shortage of terribly awkward dialog. I am done throwing fancy words at this mess.<br/><br/>Now the rating. I have relied on IMDb for solid reviews for many years now. For the most part I have agreed with their rating, I could argue a half point here and there but 4-6 points? My guess is the John Wick studio has found a way to game this system. Crazy idea, right? To me it's more plausible than the plot line of the movie. Somebody at IMDb should look into this because it would be our loss if this gets out of hand."
"cwroan","1","70","149","18 January 2015"," It was the opposite of enjoyment watching this movie
","I have watched probably close to a thousand movies in my time. Hardly ever have I seen one in which a major Hollywood actor has had to endure such a poorly produced crime drama as John Wick.<br/><br/>It is a shame that an actor with the potential of Keanu Reeves has to work in such a meaningless film. I sure hope he does not go the way of Nicolas Cage, whose last good movie was made in 2003 (Matchstick Men). My fears though of a career collapse are slowly but surely being realized with Keanu as this makes a two-for-two terrible movies list (47 Ronin was in the category of WTF). I will have to watch Generation Um... and Man of Tai Chi to see what calibre of production Reeves has been partnered with of his last four films.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, John Wick is a totally un-enjoyable movie not only because the plot line is yet another US State Department propaganda piece using Russians as the bad guys but because the audience is not given the tools to sympathize for any character, both ""bad"" and ""good"" alike.<br/><br/>The aftertaste of John Wick is a dark, dreary monolithic crime drama revenge movie that elicits zero compassion, respect or other noble feelings and imparts not one lesson of humanity to the audience. It does its job though of leaving a dark impression of Russians and a vaguely justified negative thought-impression of that particular strain of people."

","So disgusting is this piece of filth that after one hour of perpetual killings, many of them graphic and sadistic, I simply had to leave the room and get some fresh air. I then immediately destroyed the DVD as a public service.<br/><br/>The makers of this material should be arrested and imprisoned for corrupting society. And anyone who actually enjoys watching this ordure should immediately seek mental health advice. What plot there is can only be described as infantile and absurd. The film is simply a vehicle for promoting video games where the player searches out black hooded figures to exterminate them.<br/><br/>We are expected to believe that a trained hit-man is woken at night by his puppy only to be hijacked by three (naturally) Russian mafia gangsters who beat him up, steal his treasured car and kill his dog.<br/><br/>This same man then kills literally hundreds of security guards and other hit men who come at him one by one in a morbid procession of death. Night club revelers carry on regardless as security men are gunned down in their midst. Other security guards have their throats cut whilst seemingly standing there helplessly waiting for death.<br/><br/>The concept that all these security men all have partners, mothers and families does not deter the hero. We are encouraged to think that any scale of revenge is permissible under all circumstances and to all proportions even though most of these murdered guards didn't actually do anything against him.<br/><br/>The only merit of this film is that it represents perfectly the mentality of American culture; namely that if a cell of terrorists kill a few thousand Americans we are entitled to launch decades or war thereafter, bring tens of millions of innocent Muslim civilians into endless suffering and destroy the entire culture of the Middle East.

"MovieSonic","9","26","50","14 January 2015"," Kill All The Things
","Keanu Reeves always comes back with a little gem but this one is his best film in ages.<br/><br/>It's a pure Kill Film, nothing more and nothing less. Keanu, as John Wick, has the only two things he has left in this world taken from him at a time when he has nothing left to live for and so, entirely understandably, he decides to take revenge. Keanu then proceeds to kill a significant amount of people.<br/><br/>Here's what I liked about John Wick: clearly, whoever was in charge, really loves film and/or knows exactly how to improve upon every mediocre revenge film out there. The clichéd bits seemed almost deliberate like a teacher showing his or her film students how to make a tired and overdone scene interesting and unique.<br/><br/>I won't expand too much on this point other than to say that there is something engaging about every scene no matter how often it has been done before.<br/><br/>What I really want to talk about is the fight scenes. This is the first time since the Bourne films that I feel someone has done something different and unique with fight choreography. All the fights seemed to be filmed in one take and without stunt doubles. There was one extended fight scene in particular in the middle which was stunning. I genuinely can't think of another actor who would have pulled off Keanu's character and choreography as well as he did.<br/><br/>During the inevitable 'sit-down' with the bad guy and his men, they missed an opportunity to mirror a previous scene with a 'captured' female assassin, nevertheless; Keanu gets an opportunity to really let go and bring some much needed emotion to his character. I thought he could have gone further and this could have been more poignant but he delivered the scene really well.<br/><br/>I think it's time to officially acknowledge a new genre of film: the kill film. I wouldn't label it as action because I expect action films to include action as part of the main story not the other way around. If you want to watch a good revenge/kill film, this is definitely the one.<br/><br/>9/10"

"ReluctantPhilistine","8","19","35","22 November 2014"," The Return of the Action Flick
","There is a scene in ""John Wick"" – the new shoot-em-up starring Keanu Reeves – in which the hero is about to be ""interrogated"" by the bad guys in true Jack Bauer fashion. Viggo Tarasov, the sinister Russian crime boss and Wick's former employer - played by Michael Nyqvist - takes the moment to sermonize. ""People don't change,"" he says to Wick. ""Times do."" <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves used to be one of the biggest stars in Hollywood following the success of The Matrix, but afterwards, he never recaptured that superstar persona, despite his attempts at kitschy roles like the ones he played in ""47 Ronin"" or ""Constantine."" <br/><br/>But Viggo was right, people don't change, and this film signals Keanu Reeves' return to the role of ass-kicking leading man that we first experienced in ""Speed"" and loved in ""The Matrix,"" and time has tempered him into a stronger and grittier action-star than he was 15 years ago. <br/><br/>Reeves' character John Wick is one that we all know, the veteran hit man who is reluctantly pulled back into his past life to bloodily take revenge on all those who've wronged him. This film is essentially an assassin film with a fresh coat of paint. But although it's been done to death, I never had a chance to get bored, as the gripping pace and beautiful cinematography will keep you invested.<br/><br/>John's wife dies early-on, but from cancer, not bullets. Wick is initially a grieving husband, and Reeves' emotionless stare is actually put to good use. The only company he keeps is a small puppy – his wife's last gift to him. When Russian criminals follow him home one day to steal his car – a sleek 69' Mustang – the dog is viciously silenced as Wick lay stunned on the ground.<br/><br/>The men were members of the Russian crime syndicate, led by Viggo's hot-headed son Iosef (Alfie Allen), thinking Wick an ordinary man. But he was actually a hit man for Viggo before he retired, and was so successful that he was nicknamed ""Baba Yaga"" or The Boogeyman, the storybook embodiment of vengeance that punishes those who misbehave. <br/><br/>Like the storybook character, Wick is an unstoppable force of nature, and the film follows him from gunfight to gunfight, chasing Iosef and gunning down subordinates while the Russians try to escape.<br/><br/>This is an astonishing film for a directorial debut. David Leich and Chad Stahelski are both prolific stunt men – and they know how to film an action scene. The choreography strikes just the right balance between acrobatics and brutality, with scenes that smacked of 2006's ""Casino Royale,"" when the dapper Bond was re-invigorated with the frenetic energy of an action hero. <br/><br/>The film may appeal more to that side of you that claps and squeals excitedly at explosions and loud noises, but there is enough character and personality here to justify a brief excursion into the land of campy blockbusters. <br/><br/>Wick's mentor Marcus is played by a grizzled Willem Dafoe, and the owner of the Continental Hotel – an establishment that caters specifically to hit men – is played by Ian McShane. Even John Leguizamo puts in an intense yet brief performance as Aureilo, the owner of a chop-shop where the Russians take Wick's car. <br/><br/>Everyone works for the Russians, so when Wick returns to the biz to exact his revenge, everyone knows him and continually ask him if he's back. It's funny, and the running dialogue refers to not only John Wick, but also to Reeves. <br/><br/>And it must be said that whatever the film lacks in depth, it makes up for in coolness.<br/><br/>Wick drives not just one sexy muscle car, but three. He alternates between wearing the ""Rebel without a Cause"" leather/T-shirt combo and the tailored suits of a professional killer. The music also alternates between groovy guitar riffs with rock overtones to deafening dance music with pounding pace-setting percussion. And the fisticuffs on display will have home viewers pausing and rewinding often to catch every crunch, twist, and snap. This is a film to be seen in IMAX. <br/><br/>Late in the film, Wick escapes one hair-raising situation with a shower of bullets and attitude (spoilers I know), and is once again asked by a former associate if he's back in the game, while he stands, covered in gore and glory. ""Yeah,"" he says. ""I'm thinking I'm back.""<br/><br/>Well Mr. Reeves, I think so too. Welcome back."

The story is silly, but the action is continuous as Wick is pursued throughout by men and women with bad intentions. He is a karate expert and is also skilled with a variety of knives and firearms which are quite useful to our hero. His background is sketchy and never really explained but one must just suspend belief and just take the ride as if on a roller coaster. Willem Defoe shows up to fill out a decent cast with Reaves carrying most of the load, as he is in almost every scene. It looks good and the New York locations are a good choice. A final 7.5/10."

In fact, Liam Neeson in ""Take a Commuter Cold Walk All Night In The Tombstones"" moves faster. The John Wick fight scenes are like watching a senior fumble around with another old man while said old man barely makes an attempt to fight back. Some scenes the thugs actually pause before throwing a blow just so Keanu Reeves can catch up and block it.

"dmhughes-448-695102","9","21","42","13 November 2014"," Welcome Back Keanu Reeves!
","It's actually hard to remember the last time when Keanu Reeves was in a truly noteworthy, memorable, and quotable film, despite him being one of my favorite actors. 47 Ronin (2013), aside from being a notorious box office bomb, was completely forgettable; Generation Um (2012) was a mess; The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) was an unnecessary remake, and Man of Tai Chi (2013), despite being a solid and well-made directorial debut from Reeves, didn't leave much of a lasting impression.<br/><br/>However, I've always felt that Reeves would eventually make another film that was worth the price of admission, and not just a cursory glance and rental in a video store. Thankfully, Reeves has made a fantastic return to his old, action-movie roots with John Wick (2014), a film that seems to have been designed specifically for fans of Reeves, and after finding out about how the film has performed better than expected at the box office, I can only hope that this film will help Reeves get back into the spotlight. He's definitely earned it as he is in one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>The actual plot of the film is incredibly simplistic, which in this case is a good thing. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a retired hit man who has recently lost his wife, Helen (briefly played by Bridget Moynahan) to a disease (that is not clarified). Wick finds out that his wife left him a puppy, named Daisy, but before Wick can attempt to move on with his life, Russian mobster Iosef (played by Theon Greyjoy actor Alfie Allen) and his thugs break into Wick's home, mug him, steal his '69 Mustang, and then kill Daisy. John Wick then grabs his old guns and returns to the violent (also sophisticated, old-fashioned, and honorable) mob world that he had once escaped in order to find Iosef and exact his terrible vengeance. <br/><br/>I must admit I think this is easily the best performance Reeves has given since The Matrix sequels came out back in 2003. John Wick is a man of few words, but his expressions and actions (mostly violent) more than make up for it, which really works in Reeves' favor (dialogue has never been his best attribute, and I'm looking at you Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)). Wick is by no means a hero; every character Wick runs into remarks about his terrible and legendary past, and I quickly realized that Wick was simply the best bad man in a world of terrible characters. Reeves clearly gave his all in this film, as in every action scene I could tell his career decision to perform a majority of his own stunts pays off; I never saw Keanu Reeves taking down bad guys in this film, I always saw John Wick, and it was a performance that truly felt real.<br/><br/>Reeves may be the star of the show, but he also has an impressive ensemble cast helping him out. Michael Nyqvist (of the Swedish The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy fame) is excellent as Viggo Tarasov, the leader of the New York Russian mob, Wick's former employer, and Iosef's father. You can tell that Viggo is the sort of man who is willing to place the life of his family (no matter how idiotic) over his former friendship with Wick, which creates an intriguing conflict. Alfie Allen plays another greedy, foolish character, which has become a well played, but too familiar archetype. William Dafoe and Adrianne Palicki, have solid bits as Marcus and Perkins, close associates/enemies of Wick, and John Leguizamo and Ian McShane have memorable but important cameos as Aurelio and Winston. <br/><br/>What impressed me the most about this film, besides the excellent action, slick and stylish choreography, a diverse and cool soundtrack, and great performances, was the world that Wick inhabits. It is revealed that Wick is a former member of the Continental, a society of hit men/assassins who reside in a fancy hotel, and live by a strict code of honor, chivalry, and rules, and if these rules are broken, there can be severe consequences. It was really creative, and I found it to be a world that could be expanded upon in future (fingers crossed) installments.<br/><br/>John Wick is an action film that arrived at a time when a film of this caliber is so desperately needed. First, it managed to bring Keanu Reeves back into the spotlight; second, it's an old fashioned action film that still managed to feel fresh; and finally, it's a film that I could tell had a lot of heart and effort in it. I truly hope that Reeves' efforts will result in a sequel or similar film, and a resurgence of interest in actor who played The One. Overall, John Wick is a blast, and is a must-see for any fan of the action genre.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 9/10"

","I got a couple recommendations to see this movie from friends and heard online that it was great. Huge disappointment I am legitimately annoyed that I watched that, at times it was so cringe worthy, I wanted to look away.<br/><br/>The plot is very shallow. There is little character development and the action movie clichés are off the radar. Its like a pre-teen action movie enthusiast wrote this and no one critiqued it. My favorite part was John Leguizamo's scene, but its all downhill from there.<br/><br/>I thought maybe Keanu wrote and directed this himself since he is so adept at shooting guns in real life, and maybe he wanted to show it off. Also since you would have to be so full of yourself to even do this movie. But the firefights were boring and as you can imagine, gun handling prowess is not exactly entertaining.<br/><br/>The thing is, straight from the beginning you can tell its bad, but you say, well maybe it will get better. There is nothing original about the badassness being displayed, it is painfully contrived. I am gonna have to draw up an action movie script myself to see if maybe being original is hard at this point just to try to justify the staleness of this movie.<br/><br/>The whole boogeyman thing was corny, and Keanu did not do anything we haven't already seen a million times before. And how about when he was taking a shower and all you see is the Pillsbury dough-boy and you expect me to believe he is the deadliest killer alive? I would have liked to have seen a more cerebral assassin style of rampage mode movie. Do not recommend, I would recommend Wanted over this its got a better stylized action."

","I didn't know what to expect out of this movie. When I saw the trailer, I wasn't really impressed. Nothing about it really caught my attention. But then I started hearing things about John Wick, very good things, and ratings for it were high. That's what really caught my attention for it.<br/><br/>John Wick is a former hit-man who retired from his profession when he found a woman he loved. When his wife dies suddenly, John wishes to grieve alone until a few days later when he realizes his wife left behind one final gift for him; a puppy. After a minor altercation leads to an even bigger one when thugs decide to break in, steal his car, and kill his dog, John Wick decides that retirement would have to wait until his revenge is fulfilled.<br/><br/>What makes John Wick different from other shoot em' up movies is that we're provided with details of John's former life, including old partners and a hotel front which leads the audience eager to wonder the many tales that can be told about John Wick. The movie is fast paced, never really a dull moment, and it always keeps you wondering what he's going to do next and how. Also, his style. John Wick loves using the double tap to his advantage.<br/><br/>What else can I say? John Wick is an amazing movie and I can't wait to see what the sequel(s) will provide for us."

Keanu didn't even prepare well for the movie. His body lacked the necessary muscles for such a super strong bad ass. Yet, he was hit so many times thrown off floors and he just gets up and continues fighting like it was nothing. <br/><br/>I gave it 4 our of 10 because the action sequences were kinda slick. Totally unrealistic though, but still cool. And even still, the action sequences are repetitive without much change as the film progresses. <br/><br/>Long story short, this movie has no plot, no logic, no hype, abrupt transitions, and a super hero with a white pasty body."

Even if i swallow the fact that Mr. Wick is doing impossible things during the entire film, the story about an ex hit-man that goes back in business for revenge is so thin, that it could have been told in 10 minutes instead of two hours. All the movie shows is a thousand ways how to kill someone, nothing else basically. Although nicely filmed, it's a big pointless yawn in the end. Keanu Reeves does his acting job much much better in the Matrix, and The action parts there are much more enjoyable. Waste your time on something with brains behind it. This lacks it completely."

","I had an opportunity to see this movie at an early release showing, and I passed it up. Once I saw the film, I could've kicked myself for missing it. This is a relatively straight forward action film, that spends just the right amount of time setting up the main character. Then, the movie kicks into high gear, and it doesn't let up until the end. Believe the hype on this one, it is a gem of an action film. The fight sequences are well-choreographed, and this can't be emphasized enough, filmed cleanly with no shaky cam. <br/><br/>Keanu gets a lot of flack for being a somewhat wooden actor. Maybe this is true, but it suits him well in this film. He's supposed to be some truly fearful man, so when he decides to tell you why he is on this quest for vengeance, you better listen. The nightclub scene is iconic, and he owns it. The rest of the action is solid, but not much can hold a candle to that scene. The film loses a beat in the last act, but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the film. <br/><br/>On a somewhat personal level, the opening scenes establishing John's relationship with his wife, when he receives her final gift, and when he finally tells Viggo why he is on this mission of vengeance, along with the absolutely excellent action combine to make a movie that is well above the average. One of my favorite movies of 2014."

"ZChrisJ1995","7","24","50","10 November 2014"," A solid return to form for Keanu Reeves, and a rare standout action flick
","After a recent barrage of rather forgettable action films, it's refreshing to see that 'John Wick' provides excellently-choreographed, energized fight sequences as well as elaborate chase scenes, in addition to a likable protagonist who you can easily root for. <br/><br/>In essence a revenge flick, 'John Wick' details the titular ex-hit-man's mission to hunt down the people that stole his car and killed his dog, the latter being a final gift from his deceased wife. As it turns out, the people he's pursuing are related to his former employer. <br/><br/>I'm not the hugest fan of Keanu Reeves as an actor, but he nails the role of John. It's largely a physical performance, with John being a seemingly introverted, rarely talkative individual. This sympathetic, almost vulnerable side is juxtapositioned effortlessly with the brutal, merciless part of him that reawakens on his quest for vengeance. A great return to form for someone who hasn't really had a decent role since 'The Matrix Trilogy' or 'A Scanner Darkly'. <br/><br/>A lot of the other cast members, such as Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo, as well as a surprisingly large amount of people who have worked on HBO programs, receive very limited screen time considering their impressive portfolios. Nevertheless, they are all still able to maintain a hefty screen presence. <br/><br/>Being directed by a stunt choreographer, it doesn't really come as a surprise that 'John Wick' has some ridiculously well-made shootouts and car chases. A highlight is John's rampage through a nightclub, gunning down countless dozens of thugs in his pursuit of his dog's killer. As opposed to a lot of the uninspired, uninventive cinematic action releases of recent years, 'John Wick's' set-pieces maintain a highly fluid and energetic quality.<br/><br/>The film itself has an interesting portrayal of the complex criminal underworld that lies right on the brink of normal society, a world that John is forced to return to. Everyone appears to know each other (John included), from 'waste disposers' to bartenders to hotel guests. It comes across as an unorthodox (yet welcome) hybrid of Guy Ritchie and David Lynch tropes. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'John Wick' is a standout production in a list of otherwise banal recent action films, aided by its excellently-crafted actions scene, and a solid protagonist in the form of Keanu Reeve's John."

","You'll regret!<br/><br/>Was this a video game turned into a movie? Whom ever said Keanu reeves could carry and action movie alone LIED This movie has some major plot holes, along with some serious bad acting. *********************Warning spoiler******************************* It all starts with the same guys whom harass him at a gastation, breaks into he's home kick he's ass, kills he's dog and steals he's car. You never get to know how they found him, without knowing that john wicker is the guy you don't mess with. Even though he's car is apparently legendary,since what I assume is the best car chopper in town, won't touch it cause he knows who it belongs to.<br/><br/>Another thing that struck me odd is, since when did the Russian mob do home invasion, just to steal a classic car to chop. To me that seem kind of petty for a organized crime syndicate<br/><br/>John is suppose to be a professional hit man, the best of the best, cream of the crop. Yet he get he's ass kicked by a couple of thugs, wastes a lot of ammo by shooting people 5-6 times. He can't even take out 5-6 guys with a machine gun, and a 30 round clip. Not even when he has the element of surprise on he's side <br/><br/>And the hand to hand combat is mostly bad. He got no style, no class, no elegance over it. I almost feel I'm watching American ninja all over again, were hand to hand fighting mostly consisted,of judo throws,wide punches and a few simple locking techniques.That's how bad this movie is. <br/><br/>Every bad guy in the Russian mob seem to knows martial arts, cause 90% of them get into hand to hand fights with him. Most of the times he act like a rank amateur, instead of the super professional everyone is so scared of, that they start shaking in their pants whenever someone just mentioning he's name <br/><br/>I really wish they'd give these types of roles to Jason Statham, he's better at playing these types of bad to he bone roles. Keanu reeves are better suited for something else, like playing stoner in Bill & Ted Best part of the entire movie, is when the scene when the head honcho of the Russian mob finds out over the phone,what he's son has done"
"ISlapGoats","2","12","22","8 April 2016"," Generic and predictable movie
","This will be a short review because I already wasted enough time watching this drivel. I could have watched it while flying a stunt plane through the Grand Canyon and not missed a single character or plot development - because there really weren't any. Everything played out in such a predictable and formalistic fashion that I was beginning to think it was double bluff. <br/><br/>So what were the redeeming features? It certainly wasn't the acting and I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan. Perhaps he failed to connect to the character the same way I did. I couldn't really fault the fight scenes, they were pretty well choreographed.<br/><br/>Looking at the IMDb message boards a common defense seems to be that the movie shouldn't be taken too seriously in order to be enjoyed but there's no evidence that John Wick is in any way trying to be a tongue-in-cheek parody or intentionally cliché. Telling people not to take a poor joke too seriously doesn't magically make it a better joke.<br/><br/>John Wick's character is talked up to be one of the cleverest and toughest men in the world but it's evident that he's actually just one of the luckiest. I've seen storm troopers hit more targets than his enemies and there were a few occasions where his lack of basic precaution left him needing to be saved by his old pal Willem Defoe. <br/><br/>A good example of incompetence came from one of John Wick's old 'hard man' pals when he had handcuffed a deadly assassin to a chair in such a way that all she had to do was stand up to be detached from the chair. I can't help notice these little things in films and each one adds strain to the suspension of disbelief, which in this movie, ultimately broke it and left me wanting the movie to end as bad as Wick wanted to avenge his dog."

","Awful. But I'm happy to concede that there are plenty of folks out there who want to escape with just the kind of strong feelings this work will conjour.<br/><br/>It's just a pity it had to happen in my living room, and the people to blame for that are the Western European censors, who presumably are working to definite guidelines in rating this film suitable for medium-sized teenagers to watch. Why is this? Why is this gratuitous violence, that has no redeeming features at all, certainly no artistic merit, rated suitable to stream into living rooms full of ordinary young people? I can perhaps understand a 15 rating in a cinema, because the well-run cinemas I know are not lax enough to allow smaller adolescents in to this, but to rate this a 15 for home use is to confuse it with gentle, memorable and even great works that don't get a 12 for one difficult scene or one awkward adult plot line. This, though is R for every scene, even the one or two where Reeves just drives.<br/><br/>I do understand why people want to make films like this. There is money in them. I do occasionally watch them myself, although I didn't make it all the way through this one, because the plot was so flimsy it just got blown away along with the first wave of carnage, and you knew there would be no more story after, what: 20 minutes? (does that amount to a spoiler, telling you that there's nothing to spoil?) I limped on and dipped in and out after that, so at least I'm confident that I'm being fair.<br/><br/>If there is any idea that arises (difficult to credit, really) it is this. People do things to us that instil strong feelings of revenge. But we cross the line if we allow ourselves to act instinctively in response. The message I would urge upon both the film-maker and his audience: he shouldn't have allowed himself to succumb and actually make the nasty little film, and you should have ignored his plea to help him recoup his investment. The alternative is nothing but dead puppies, some of them human."

Since when the police keeps complete silence on murders and accidents? At least question him! One more vital notice: Who is John Wick! I watched 40 min and I still don't know him. Is he CIA agent? Police agent? What!!! Why everyone in the movie knows him?

But no instead now this former hit-man gets all of his old weapons ready, the boss decides to send loads of assassins to kill the hit-man (already this is just really stupid) and it becomes some kind of boring boring revenge movie with the point of the revenge being stupid and one of the most easily avoidable and irrational reasons to go on a killing spree of any revenge move, where the hit-man is killing generic henchman after generic henchman who are sent in waves and really stupid, just there to die.

I just remained asking ""where is the d**n story?""<br/><br/>What you get presented with in this movie is a - up until the end still - flat character, who is taking revenge for the loss of his dog shortly after the death of his wife, who also gifted him the dog. So this John is described as a professional with amazing focus and at the same time with great inner rage, why he ends up going for his revenge no matter the consequences. But the movie doesn't succeed in delivering this believable character combining both these extremes. He sometimes is forgiving and other times scrupulous. It doesn't add up... It rather gave me the impression, that he is ""nice"" to people, so they can come again later and make the movie longer. But so is it on the other side with the ""bad"" guys, too. Why are they sometimes ""nice""? I couldn't understand.<br/><br/>If you though look from the prospective of the storytelling, it makes sense. It delivers more movie-time! There are a couple of scenes, where it became very obvious, that whatever was going on was for the single reason of prolonging the (rather non-existent) story.<br/><br/>What remains most prominent of all this watching time is seeing many head-shots of faces, you can't really make out enough to have some kind of emotional response, other than the excitement of the fighting itself.<br/><br/>I liked the music though.

"Kmark1293","8","25","53","26 October 2014"," Keanu Reeves is back in an action flick done right.
","Personally, I am not really a big fan of the clichéd revenge plot, especially when its applied to big Hollywood action movies. However, as soon as the positive buzz about John Wick started to come around, I started to become more curious about checking it out in theaters. It felt weird seeing great reviews out of a revenge story at first, but in the end, it turned out to be a pretty good action thrill ride.<br/><br/>John Wick takes the plot of a hit-man coming out of retirement to duke out justice on those who dare to mess with the things he loved and turns it into a fairly unique story. Sure, there are certain clichés and a delivery of cheesy lines at times, but the movie manages to not take itself seriously and makes those aspects work. Although it may a paper thin plot to begin with, its serviceable enough to introduce our characters and jumps straight into the action.<br/><br/>The acting throughout is also serviceable enough for the type of action-driven story the movie was going for. Keanu Reeves may not be the greatest actor in the world and I can probably name 10 other actors that are worse than him, he somehow manages to put on a good performance. Its his best work of acting since The Matrix and I believe Reeves was meant to be an action star along the lines of Schwarzenegger and Statham. As for the rest of the cast including Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, William Dafoe, and Dean Winters, lets just say that they do a solid job portraying their given characters. They aren't really bad by any means, its just the main focus is on John Wick since he is the title of the film.<br/><br/>In terms of technical aspects, its pretty much the strongest part about the movie. The lighting gives the film a very dark and gritty feel throughout its run-time and its certain shading of blue colors also adds to the film's bleak environment. Every camera shot is smooth and steady and they keep a tight focus on showcasing the fast paced action on screen. Speaking of action scenes, they are also executed brilliantly through excellent choreography and great editing, all without having to resort to unnecessary shaky cam.<br/><br/>John Wick is one of the best American action flicks to come out in quite some time. It may not be on the same level as The Raid 2, it still come in pretty close in terms of high octane action. Its simple story and characters give you something to work off of and its adrenaline fueled action sequences will have you on the edge of you seat and wanting more when its all over. If you are the type of person who craves this crazy level of vengeance and violence, then you owe to yourself to go and check out John Wick. Definitely worth a recommendation."

","Terrible film! Typical mass-produced garbage regurgitated from the same mass-produced garbage from the past. There is nothing original here and was made for 15 yr old boy's that need a hit of violence. Why take the grueling time to write a story when you have another plot you can build on from 25 years ago? With modern movies, everything goes into marketing; this is the new art form. The commercials, the distribution, the target audience, are all far more the focus than the actual content of the film - all in the name of profit. This movie definitely shows Keanu Reeves inability to act at all. The plot was like water and of course very predictable. They really build up his character, then when the fight sequences begin it's like watching something that they did back in the 70's. The movie ""The Drop"" with Tom Hardy is the same movie really, however 100 times better. Tom Hardy is incredible and has just begun to shine as an actor in film - so I recommend that film over this for sure. This movie is a complete waste of time and I don't normally write reviews, but really had to for this one."

"Black_Circle","5","2","2","31 January 2020"," Man shoots baddies
","This film was clearly written for 13-15 year old boys that watch wrestling and follow a bunch of gun pages on Instagram. Im actually surprised it wasn't written by those very same people to be honest, judging by the script.<br/><br/>Script - awful.
Acting - awful.
Character development - non existent (and not the good kind like in The Raid whereby that aspect actually helps us get to the action sooner and lets us understand the world its set in as we go along, keeping us on our toes).
Score - something from an edgy 15 year old boys iPod.
Plot - something that same edgy 15 year old wrote on the bus ride home from school that took him 7 minutes.<br/><br/>I know this film is set up to be an action film. I know that the lack of character development and world building is intentional and I know that the tone is supposed to represent some sort of fun video game.....it doesn't work. If you are over the age of 15, that is.<br/><br/>Im amazed at how low peoples standards are for films. it seems that most people just don't care about good film making. Most people just want to pop a film on, watch some stuff happen, not think too much about it and move on. Thats fine (if not slightly immature and insulting to the art form) but there is a very clear difference between you enjoying a film and that film being a 10/10. Of course this sort of stuff is subjective but the fact that you liked a film doesn't mean it is objectively a good film. Just because Keanu Reeves does some spinny stuff and drives a cool car, doesn't actually mean that there is any substance to what's going on. They might as well have named this film Evil Russian Shooty Man or something, it really wouldn't have made any difference and people would still have give it a ridiculous rating. 7.4....really?<br/><br/>Firstly there are other films that do exactly what this film does, only better and more entertaining. The Raid is a good example, as previously mentioned. I heard a lot of hype surrounding this film for a while and one of the things people liked most was that the fight choreography included legitimate martial arts techniques....Nope. Sorry, not the case. I heard that jiu jitsu was featured in this film, which is actually the only reason I watched it to begin with. I saw one Kimura...and a bad one at that, and I saw an arm bar...again, a bad one. That was it. Would the film be any different without those two things? nope.<br/><br/>Shooty gun man is invincible. Thats the video game vibe thing they were going for I guess. Completely saps any tension from any scene and takes away from the severity of the plot. They also over exposed a lot of scenes which I guess is again, another attempt to create the video game vibe thingy. There are seriously better examples of that kind of thing done on Youtube. Even Kung Fury managed to get the tone right for what it was. This just made me question if that was intentional or just bad editing.<br/><br/>Terrible comic relief which they just throw in there every now and again. Doesn't add to anything and only makes you question the writing choices. Like, does every cop know who John Wick is? or was it just coincidentally that one cop that showed up at his door that one time? am I supposed to think about that? I guess not because it is never mentioned again or explained ever so move on. Why do the police not arrest this guy? is he just so much of a badass that they don't even bother? does he work for them sometimes? do laws not exist in this world but for some reason cops still exist? was that just a friend of his that isn't really a cop and just likes to wear that uniform? who knows, its never explained. Oh well it really doesn't matter and affects nothing in any way whatsoever...move on.<br/><br/>Evil Russians are clearly not Russian at all. And judging by how blatant they conduct their business I guess cops really don't exist in this world because no one is arrested or confronted by them at all. They just walk around with guns and stuff and no one seems to care. Fair enough I don't care at this point just show me some cool shooty gun man stuff.<br/><br/>No time for that because we now have to go to ""the continental"". A hotel for criminals to hang out and party....how, why....what!? its the most ridiculous thing ever honestly. No criminal business is to be conducted in this hotel by the way, unless of course you're bribed into it, just because...I dunno, its never explained.
Shooty gun man doesn't care for this rule and goes mental with his spinny shooty gun stuff and then we're greeted to more comic relief from the hotel receptionist. Hilarious stuff 10/10 comedy, this stuff is better than monty python. I mean seriously the guy just acts like everything is normal when clearly things are not normal. You just cant write this stuff absolute comedy gold 10/10 mate.<br/><br/>Girl is bribed to kill shooty gun man and decides that its a good time as shoots gun man is just laying on the bed fully clothed in a suit like a mannequin someone knocked over, stiff as a board. They wrestle, he has a hard time beating her even though he's supposed to be the killer of all killers or something like that. She puts a poor kimura grip on him which he gets out of immediately and throws her through a random pane of glass thats just in the middle of the room for no reason. He had no problem shooting 35 people directly in the face just 7 minutes ago but for some reason allows her to live. Because she's a girl? who knows its never explained.<br/><br/>Willem Defoe is also in this film. I honestly don't know his characters name or his relationship with Shooty gun man but at some point he's hired to kill shooty gun man but its later revealed that he's actually a good guy and was just helping him all along?...I think. He kills a couple guys around shooty gun man, sure. Ok. But what about the scene where the girl tried to kill him? You could've killed her without even waking him up. why shoot an inch away from his head? to wake him up to warn him?....just shoot the girl. Oh well it doesn't matter and its never explained or brought up ever again so don't think about it I guess.<br/><br/>Theres also the over exaggeration of shooty gun mans skills. He's spoken about as if he's the grim reaper or something and often referred to as ""the boogeyman"" or ""the guy you send to kill the bogeyman"" this line in particular is loved by fans of this average at best film and I honestly couldn't think of a more cringe way to describe someone. He shoots guns...thats his skill. He's good at it, don't get me wrong I appreciate a bit of spinny shooty stuff as much as anyone else but thats his skill. He's not a ghost and he's not the bogeyman and you don't need to add cheesy flash cards to the screen every time this is said. Especially when at multiple points during the film he was in a position to be killed by the bad guys but they just chose not to...even though the whole point of the film is to kill him...?<br/><br/>Even the Son of Evil Russian boss man doesn't know who he is and him and three of his idiot friends manage to break into his house undetected and beat the crap out of him. Easily could have killed him there and we're only 5 minutes into the film at this point. Why does every one know who shooty gun man is except from son of evil Russian boss man? don't know its never explained, don't think about it. Even Mr evil Russian Boss man himself has an opportunity to kill him at one point but instead decides to tie him to a chair, talk to him and walk away. Why? there is literally no motive whatsoever for keeping him alive. Its never explained so don't think about it. And people are really bigging this film up for having villains that aren't just dumb cliches...really?<br/><br/>Even im thinking ""its just a dog"" at this point. Why did it take you a couple days to get angry about the dog? you were there when it happened....you're the guy you send to kill the bogeyman....they didn't even have any weapons....what even is this film? An anecdote about killing 3 guys with a pencil is just not enough to hang the entire plot on, its just not.<br/><br/>This film is the definition of style over substance. Some people are going to love it and others will likely not if they care about good film making or story telling in any way. Ultimately I applaud the director duo on making a film they were clearly passionate about. Say what you what about this film (and trust me there is a lot to say) but you can't knock their ambition. 2 retired stunt men making a film about stunts actually does add to the charm of it and its clearly not just some soul-less product pumped out by Hollywood's plot regurgitating ass like we're used to 99% of the time. So well done there. Clearly some effort was made, especially in the fight choreography and editing. Im very glad they actually allowed us to see the action instead of cutting every 0.4 seconds to make the action seem even more intense. All of the best action films have long, one cut fight scenes that actually showcase the actors abilities. Keanu Reeves was a good choice for shooty gun man and played his part well considering the script gave him almost nothing to work with. You can see that it was actually him doing those scenes and you have to admire that on some level even if you're like me and didn't parictually enjoy the film as a whole.<br/><br/>I'd love to give this a higher rating. Maybe I'll revisit one day and appreciate it a little more now that I know what to expect...and what not to expect.<br/><br/>If spinny shooty gun man ghost killer bogeyman guy sounds appealing then give it a go you'll probably enjoy it. Beer and friends will help I'd imagine.<br/><br/>Alternatively you could just watch The Raid and save yourself 101 minutes of your life.<br/><br/>5/10 and thats generous."

","The film John Wick"" has well deserved my straight one-star-rating: for the fantastic looks of Keanu Reeves and the absolutely cool music.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the story line is not at all carrying the whole length of the film: An alighted former order killer who started into a normal life again, is just mourning about the death of his beloved wife when he is being attacked by the brutal and greedy son of a former opponent. The nasty guy and his friends not just stole his nice car but also killed his cute little dog. Now he is seeking for revenge. <br/><br/>The whole story is told in the first quarter of an hour and the remaining film is focusing on the merciless seeking for revenge.<br/><br/>Not too much surprising content: A lot of clichés, black and white characters, not even the dialogues are too bright either. Funny impressions just arise from the absurd exaggeration in violent scenes.<br/><br/>A certain amount of dullness and murderous frenzy is very helpful to enjoy the amount of blood squirting out of heads and chests during almost the whole film.<br/><br/>Mr. Wick knows no mercy and there's no satisfaction until the last one is dead. Unfortunately that takes incredibly long: You will inevitably get bored of it although there are some minor variations in the killing methods presented. <br/><br/>Don't trust the average rating of this film: it's possible that the ratings are provided by some enthusiastic violence and / or car lovers and / or numb heads among those who are switching their brains off as soon as the film starts. <br/><br/>All you disappointed viewers: Why don't you share your opinion to balance this completely inappropriate good rating for this film???"

I enjoy action films, but they should have some sense of reality and character development. John Wick has neither. Gratuitous violence on 100+ (I lost count) bad guys who are seemingly just waiting to be dispatched by John. No attempt at creative engagement of the bad guys. Just show up at a particular location and start shooting. Shoot 20 or more bad guys at a nightclub, on the dance floor, while people keep dancing?? Give me a break. More like a video game than an engrossing, entertaining movie. I kept waiting for my countdown counter to reach zero, which seemed to take forever. An hour and 40 minutes totally wasted.

","This movie was so bad that I decided to leave a review for the first time ever. So many things wrong with this...<br/><br/>1. John Wick has serious communication issues. Basically the movie glorifies this guy who think it's okay to kill hundred while putting the public in danger because someone killed his dog and took his car.<br/><br/>2. John Wick suppose to be a dangerous man. Well, his security system is bad. People apparently can just waltz into his house in the middle of the night unnoticed. Plus, I'm not convinced that unskilled thugs can just waltz into some ex-hit-man's house and kick his face in. Supposedly these ex-hit-man sleep lightly and carries something heavy at all times...<br/><br/>3. Why do all the brainless thugs just walk into John Wick ""circle of violence"" with their guns drawn pointing down so they can get their face kicked in? Who does that? 4. Right, he doesn't miss anyone except when he tries to shoot at Iosef? That's a naked Iosef running around without shoes. Maybe John Wick is gay and wants some fine piece of Greyjoy for himself.<br/><br/>5. Who the heck are these people and their stupid rules? Oh, no shooting at the continental or else we'll round you up with 4 guys all shooting at you standing in the middle. I was hoping they'd miss and shoot each other.<br/><br/>6. John Wick never got his car back? And got a Dodge instead? John is okay with this? I'd keep on shooting until I get my freaking Mustang Boss back just to keep the story line consistent/less cramped with poo.<br/><br/>7. The question is, ""Can Keanu Reeves sleep at night knowing how bad this movie is""? Wait, these people don't care. When you, as an audience, hold the bar so low you have only yourself to blame for bad movies.<br/><br/>8. How is Marcus(Willam Dafoe's character) always at the right place at the right time? And how the heck would Viggo know that Marcus betrayed him when Viggo doesn't know anything most of the time? 9. Was it necessary for John Wick to take the stab from Viggo so he can break Viggo's arm and counter-stab? Wait, it is necessary. I was hoping they would both die from this stupid nonsense.<br/><br/>This movie glorifies violence over senseless crap. The dog's live is worth more then the thugs went after John Wick. This movie is perfect for people who over simplify the world and want to resolve ""issues"" with over-the-top violence. The action will keep you mind occupied but at the cost of having to accept twisted logic.<br/><br/>The thing is, I don't think John Wick ever wanted to retire and was hoping something like this would happen. Remember, this is the guy that doesn't really have job or hobby and likes to drive his car on some airport tarmac for fun while he feel sad for himself. Maybe that's why he let those thugs kick his face in in his own home. He needed a reason to go back to the only life he knew. I'll bet he was awkward as poo trying to live a ""normal"" life with the wife. Can you imagine how terrible it'd be trying to live with an ex-hit-man who has communication issues? Who knows, maybe the wife faked her own death so she can leave him since I don't think an ex-hit-man with communication issues can just casually breakup or divorce.<br/><br/>What a dysfunctional piece of crap."

","This was a good awful movie. I have no idea how this movie has a stellar rating and hype. It was the most clichéd action shooter movie. The plot follows the narrative of old first person video games. The whole plot can be summarized in a single sentence: 'Bang Bang, kill kill, you kill my dog, I kill your family' that is it. Movie is nothing but poorly choreographed gunfights. A teenager can write a better plot. All the elements in this movie are so clichéd. An over the top invincible hero who is able to kill hundreds of guys efficiently. A female assassin whom he spares, typical mafia boss antagonist, a completely predictable plot. This may amuse you if you're a 15 year old, otherwise please avoid it."

","It is impossible to write a spoiler for this movie because it is completely predictable. Just read the storyline - the movie doesn't take you anywhere else. Yet another movie where the only driving force is revenge. I wonder if most movie goers find hate and revenge to be acceptable motivations in one's live. I don't think one can blame the actors to make the same facial expression throughout the entire move - I rather think that the story doesn't have characters but rather figures like in a chess game that you move from here to there and that can perform only a single type of movement. But for those who like it loud with a lot of 'bangs' perhaps it is good relaxation and to take emotional revenge on one's boring job and unbearable boss..."

"CowherPowerForever","9","24","56","28 October 2014"," People Keep Asking If I'm Back. Yeah, I'm Thinking I'm Back.
","Keanu Reeves is back and better than ever. After a long drought on bad quality films, Reeves aimed to get back into the good graces of audiences by making this completely over the top action film. While the story is pretty generic, the action and the directing is simply top notch. If you want intense action scenes that are simply amazing R rated fun, mixed in with some fabulous acting, then you are looking in the right direction. This is my review of John Wick.<br/><br/>The film was written by Derek Kolstad and this is only his third writing credit. His prior two movies were both direct to home video action films. I have watched both of those movies he wrote(One in the Chamber and The Package). Having already watched some of his efforts in the past, I knew story wise this wasn't going to be perfect. However, the story is good cheesy fun. Reeves character(John Wick) has a tough life with the recent passing of his wife. She leaves him this sweet little dog as a gift to remember her to grieve with someone. One afternoon Wick is at a gas station and these thugs start up a conversation about his sweet 1969 Ford Mustang. The one thug ask Wick how much he wants for the car, only to reply that it is not for sale. They of course aren't happy, so they break into his house at night to kill the dog and rough him up. They of course have no idea who this person at the gas station was. This starts the chain of events that leads Wick back into the game. While the underlying story is cheesy, it is sweet fun for this genre of films. While Kolstad's effort won't net him any awards, it should make his name more popular as the characters and the set up for the action is simply amazing. I give his effort on this film a big thumbs up.<br/><br/>The film was directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Neither of these two have ever directed a film before. They have both worked as stunt coordinators. Reading into that before you go see the movie could sound some alarms, but they shot this film perfectly in my opinion. The action scenes are fast and very intense. The hand to hand combat is stellar work, and with no shaky cam action, the audience can really savor each moment in the bigger action scenes. While there is some downtime in the film, the acting plugs those holes. Keanu Reeves headlines a fabulous cast that also includes Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, and Ian McShane. The acting as I just said was top level in this film. Having so many acting legends in this one film is great because action movies do have downtime where characters need to drive the film. While there is some downtime earlier in the film, the amazing acting more than makes up for it. The first outing for these two is none other than something perfectly done. This is a fun action film that hardcore fans of the genre will love to watch. The R rating also helps as there is a great deal of blood and other over the top moments that you can't get away with on a PG-13 film. This was a fantastic effort and I cannot wait to see their projects in the future.<br/><br/>Joel J. Richard scored the film with some original music from Tyler Bates. Both have worked on bigger action films, so they know how to add a great deal of depth to a score. I really enjoy the score in this film. The bigger action scenes have some great pieces as the action is moving along. There is never really a moment when I was underwhelmed by the score. I love a great score and this is certainly one of the better scores from 2014. Both Richard and Bates get a big thumbs up in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one thrilling joy ride. The action is fast paced, with some downtime that fills in perfectly with some great acting. The actions scenes are shot perfectly and the hand to hand combat is very intense. My only real complaint is some of the downtime tends to drag on a bit, but it doesn't hurt the film all that much. Fans of the 1980s action genre will love this film. Those on the fence, well jump on over. This is a great film to see and it is worth every penny.<br/><br/>I also want to talk about the IMAX version as that is the version I watched. The IMAX version adds a tremendous amount of quality sounds, which in turn adds to the fantastic score. The picture level of course is certainly not there as the film was not shot using IMAX cameras. If you can view the IMAX version on a discount showing that would be the best bet. Otherwise, I don't really think it was worth the extra price of admittance.<br/><br/>9/10"

Linguistically, don't expect higher than a fifth grade level vocabulary or language skills. And the emotion? One note. No depth. Things blow up...quite well in fact. Beautiful, gorgeous, growling muscle cars grace the screen and upstage the actors driving them. Wonder if the count worked on them? And the dramatic cinematography earn this flick 5 stars.

","I'm glad so many people like this movie because I figure SOMEBODY has got to like this movie. A little dull. Many skilled actors given sh*t to work with. Lots of action to forget the real world, but so sterile. Like, I've never seen gun violence so repercussion-free in my entire life, just fire a bullet into the air, no problem. I would say my major complaint is that the movie is not exciting- despite a lot of gore and gun violence ( which is good, it works for me ) it all so obviously happens in a slick fake world that there's no sense of danger for any character. If anyone dies it's glamorized and therefore less real, even the double taps to the face, stylized and melodramatic."
"billygoat1071","7","20","46","30 October 2014"," Seeking for Flavor
","If Death Wish is a revenge for a murdered wife or Taken a revenge for a kidnapped daughter, then John Wick takes vengeance over a death of a dog and a stolen car. At glance, people might find it quite silly, but the movie touches no irony within that plight, it simply just pictures a desperate man with nothing left to lose. However, it still displays a strange mix of tones: it introduces the story as some sort of a serious tragedy, and then we discover that this world turns out to be surrounded with a punchline of him having a normal reputation of killing people. The combination of gritty revenge thriller and tongue-in-cheek world of assassins is fine, but how the film connects them can be a little uneven, but once the guns appear, the fun is presented perfectly. It just lives up to what it is meant to be. There isn't anything big, neither mind blowing. John Wick is as straightforward as any fine revenge movie must be, plus an odd brightening flavor.<br/><br/>Despite of setting up with a bleaker drama, John Wick actually builds a cooler mythology of its own. Sure, Wick basically has a legend of being the most lethal hit-man his enemies will ever face, that also defines to the characters who personally know him. Example is a cop who just found him wacked a few bad guys and still lets him go, because he is ""John Wick!"" It's his thing! Everyone else in this world also has their own backstories, there must be some richer stories behind them, but in the end, that's just the movie giving this typical revenge flick some personality, and it indeed helps, keeping the experience from being stale.<br/><br/>The plot never compromises with any twists, it just slow burns to the point until the anti-hero finds his target. This slow burn can be a little dragging, it introduces too much exposition that most of it turn out not going to matter in the end, they are probably designed to build more tension. The movie is better when it's finally on the action. The film biggest credit here is the camera work. There is not a shot that misses some sort of violence. Every gunshot and fist has to present the consequence on screen which manifests his boiling anger. And even without the fights, there are still some slick, stunning sights to see around. Predictably, Keanu Reeves must be the only one who is taking this silliness seriously, which makes sense since his character is the only one who is in real pain in this fancy mission. That vast seriousness just perfectly suits at depicting Wick's desperation and madness, also his fighting hits even harder compared to those days in The Matrix. But the show stealer here is Michael Nyqvist who brings the joy in his nutty yet menacing performance as the villain.<br/><br/>John Wick sometimes feels like there is a larger world meant to be explored or a deeper theme to be considered, but the film has priorities of following the classic roots of the revenge genre. It's not so bad since it makes for an easy viewing through its fine looking action scenes, but it also leaves a lot of potential hanging. But if you are only here for Keanu Reeves back in action, then this movie totally sells, in fact that is what we are all here for anyway. Still, we might have thought of some possibilities if the movie was more ambitious, but then most of us won't think it matters. It's already stunningly crafted, if not original or special. Just sit right in for a straightforward show of violent gunfights."
"juan-hb","4","3","4","16 May 2020"," A disaster from beginning to end
","The movie has two directors but the producers might have as well hired no one and save their wages. I am really sorry for Keanu, he's one of the coolest actors around and I can only imagine he was either misguided or did it for the pay check.
This movie is not better than the average low budget, low quality Steven Seagull run of the mill movie. Inverosimil script, bad direction, bad actors, bad soundtrack, bad everything.
Keanu looks like he's playing a video game from beginning to end shooting right left and centre killing dozens of guys. Even the soundtrack is more fitting of a video game.
So I'm very disappointed, I was expecting much better after all the publicity and promotion. The cinematic value of this movie is next to zero."

","Pathetic, fun, not so much.<br/><br/>I watched John Wick for the first time yesterday and decided to do an analysis<br/><br/>John Wick is a legendary retired assassin who deals with suffering after losing the great love of his life. When a gangster breaks into his home, kills his dog and steals his car, he is forced to return to active duty and begins his revenge.<br/><br/>To begin with, the plot of the film, which had everything to be great, did not please me as it should, until it starts potentially well, but then it gets lost, unfortunately. Besides, the script is very predictable and basically everything that happens next is boring and loses a lot of logic (does that mean John was a famous and skilled killer who was also part of a mafia? Oh, man ...<br/><br/>However, the most impressive thing is the violence of the film, which some found for free, and I even agree with that a little. There came a time when it was very tiring throughout the film. Unfortunately, the film apparently chose to leverage that point.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the film is not entirely ignored, the fighting choreographies are very good, to say the least, and are merely watchable today, but not enough to make up for what should have been the film's strong point: the story .<br/><br/>Well, I don't know if I'm going to check the other two sequences, because it probably must be more of the same: a skilled killer with cold-blooded killing and blood spurting everywhere ...<br/><br/>I regret the laziness of writing this text, but it is my first analysis of a film."

"Java_Joe","8","3","4","6 August 2019"," Keanu is back.
","Keanu Reeves has been called a lot of things but a good actor with range is not necessarily one of them. Don't get me wrong, I like him as an actor but he has a very narrow range in the roles he can accept. Either he plays the big, dumb doofus or he plays the loner of few words in those movies he can truly shine. And this has been shown time and time again. His dramatic roles? They tend to come off flat and stale. His attempts at accents? They tend to be terrible in every sense. But movies like ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", the first Matrix movie or this one and you can see what he's really capable of.<br/><br/>John Wick is the story of a hit man who's left that life behind. He wanted out but things force him back into it and he does not go happily. He's described as a man of focus, commitment and singular will. He never fails a job. He never gives up. And he once killed three men in a bar with a pencil. He's that much of a badass. We catch glimpses of another world where assassins get contracts, where there's hotels and services that cater to these people and where everything is paid for using gold coins. It truly gives the feeling that this is a fully fleshed out universe with history, a code of conduct and it's something happening just under our noses without us knowing.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a work of art. Whereas in a lot of action movies there's a lot of shaky cam work and quick cuts to hide the lack of skill of the actor, this one goes the opposite way and shows everything. There are long shots of John Wick doing his thing. There's fight choreography that is just beautiful to behold in it's brutality and execution. Keanu trained for this and it shows.<br/><br/>When you get down to it, it's a revenge flick but one the likes of which you probably have never seen before. It's Keanu at his best and with luck he will continue to make movies like this in the future."

"cadillac20","8","19","44","23 October 2014"," Very Solid Action Film With A Great Turn By An Awesome Cast
","John Wick was a pleasant surprise when it showed up in trailer form a little over a month ago. Coming out of nowhere, this indie action pic with a fresh director and great cast wowed a lot of people, and for good reason. It boasted the promise of excellent action, with Keanu Reeves returning to form as the badass lead. And a badass he is. John Wick is the kind of action film we don't get these days, and the director clearly knows what he is doing in delivering a truly excellent action film.<br/><br/>First things first, John Wick isn't going to win any big awards. It doesn't really do anything new, even in terms of innovative action. None of the characters are fresh and the story isn't really that original. But none of that matters because it's so stylishly crafted, the acting, direction, and writing so smooth, and the world so well designed, that any action junkie can get behind this slick, heavily stylized, action packed romp. After a flashforward, the film details the current state of John Wick's life. His wife has passed away and he is obviously taking it very hard. After her death, he receives one last gift from his wife, a puppy to help him keep from being alone. But it isn't long before he loses both his prized car and his last precious gift from his wife. With this taken from him, we find Wick falling back into his old life of assassination and violence. See, John Wick was once part of a world of criminals, assassins, and killers. And, according to the primary antagonist, he was the one who was hired to kill the boogey man.<br/><br/>And it is here where the film picks up. Where those first quiet moments in the film were somewhat slow and dreary, from the moment John Wick becomes the victim of crime to the very end of the film, it's almost non-stop action. The biggest challenge the film had was setting up Keanu to meet the legend he is described in as the film. But I can completely reassure you that Keanu is a complete badass here. While he still is not the fine, domineering actor you might find in other recently christened killers like Liam Neeson, he has the skills necessary to prove that you don't mess with John Wick. Whether it's playing up the role of a superman, capable of tackling a younger, equally talented killer while suffering a severe injury, or taking on a dozen men, all armed, in a matter of a few minutes, Keanu doesn't need to rage, pull out a booming voice, or make speeches filled with slightly ambiguous threats. All he has to do is flip you over his back and put two in your head with ease. If you don't believe Keanu is the feared killer he's trumped up to be at first, you will by the end of the film.<br/><br/>What helps pull this off are the thankful decisions of first time directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. As stuntmen, they clearly know their action. They eschew the typical, modern style of action of close ups and quick cuts in favor of nice, long medium and wide shots minus the quick cutting. This offers us practical action scenes and puts trust in the actors skills. Keanu has certainly proved himself capable physically, with his time spent in the Matrix and more recently Man of Tai Chi and Ronin 47. The directors allow him to use his skills to deliver action that never feels fake or trumped up. It's authentic and completely badass. Supporting him are an array of actors, including Wilem Defoe as an old friend in the business, Adrienne Palicki as a fellow assassin given an assignment to take John out, and Michael Nyquist and Alfie Allen as father and son gangsters, the latter of which who is the perpetrator of the crimes against Wick. Nyquist is especially good, a villain that isn't completely evil, and even a bit likable, who we're immediately introduced to as someone who doesn't necessarily want to do what he knows he has to do. He's entertaining in the role and makes for a criminal that, under different circumstances, might have actually been an ally to Wick. <br/><br/>Action films of the guns and martial arts variety have kind of gone by the wayside in the past few years, with few theatrical releases and most being VOD. But John Wick is a welcome addition to a legacy of great cinema action. For any action junkie, John Wick is an absolute must and I can only hope that this isn't the last time we'll see this Wick."

","If you are going in with a expectation of being surprised by complex plot lines and twist you will find yourself being disappointed. <br/><br/>Go to see a well composed action movie with nice effects and creative ideas on how to kill a man then you are in for a treat. <br/><br/>The pictures are filtered to set the scene of a sinister city of sin, which helps move the film along. <br/><br/>Cutting down the actions scene would help the plot reach the full potential, alas the director seems set on cramming in a maximum of killing scenes that may not all compliment the story.<br/><br/>All in all you will be entertained 80% of the movie, which I would say is quite good for the genre."

","This movie is a disgrace to the action cinema world. Though the actors portray characters well, the death of a small puppy is truly horrifying. How dare this producer allow a puppy to get beaten. I did not happen to see a ""No animals were harmed in the making of this movie"" caption and so, I assume, this director has allowed the death of a small animal. As a prominent vegan activist I would like to sue this movie and everyone included. I eat a plant based vegan diet and have for 12 years. I only get a little hungry sometimes and get a small Baconater meal at Wendy's, but besides that I am completely vegan 4/7 days of the week. I hate this movie. Basset hounds don't deserve this cruelty."
"IronBallsM","Null","19","45","25 October 2014"," Huge Disappointment To Be Honest
","I have to say given the hype, I was quite disappointed in this effort. I expected way more story and at least some intrigue. Instead, the film is an hour and a half of Keanu running around slickly shooting various different people in the head. He's angry that they killed his dog (his only chance at acceptance and peace after the death of his wife) and goes around dispatching everyone who gets in his way with head shot after head shot. That's it. Honest to God, THAT is the entire film and it's not even a spoiler because the trailer tells us as much. There's no other plot and nothing to any supporting character whatsoever. The kill action is, again, slick but nothing rises above cut video game type sequences. At least it does make a viewer stop and ponder why all the action movies we grew up watching don't factor in close range gun shots to the head more often."
"a_sad_cow","10","16","37","30 October 2014"," Outstanding action
","If you don't like action movies, don't bother. However, if you do like action movies, this is a must.<br/><br/>This movie fixes everything they screwed up in Jack Reacher. I'm quite proud of Hollywood on this count. If you liked Jack Reacher, you'll love John Wick. If you didn't like Jack Reacher but still like action movies, you will like this.<br/><br/>This movie belongs in the greats for male character development, right up there with Crank and Riddick, but somewhere below Army of Darkness, Gladiator, Rambo, and Die Hard. I know it's been a while since Keanu Reeves has done something good (thinking Matrix Reloaded), but he has seriously redeemed himself here."
"BrentHankins","7","16","37","24 October 2014"," A stylish, original revenge thriller with some truly great action.
","Despite starring in some undeniably iconic roles early in his career, Keanu Reeves has struggled to maintain any sort of momentum, with every critically acclaimed performance or box office success followed by a string of disappointing and underwhelming projects. But thanks to his former stunt double Chad Stahelski, Reeves once again finds himself headlining a solid action flick that has plenty of buzz around it.<br/><br/>Despondent over the death of his wife, retired assassin John Wick (Reeves) spends his days moping around his house, with a beagle puppy as his only companion. The dog arrived on his doorstep shortly after his wife's funeral, a final gift so that John wouldn't have to carry on alone. But an untimely run-in with Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the son of a local Russian mobster, results in the theft of John's 1969 Ford Mustang and the death of his puppy, leaving John with nothing to love - and nothing to lose.<br/><br/>Yes, that's a ridiculous segue, but it also perfectly conveys the tone of John Wick. The premise is unapologetically silly, but Reeves approaches the material with such fervor that we quickly forget about his motivations. It doesn't matter that Wick is singlehandedly disassembling the infrastructure of the Russian crime syndicate because of a dog - what matters is how much fun the film is having while he does it. Wick stalks from scene to scene with the precision of The Terminator, scarcely wasting a single movement as he dispatches bad guys in impressive numbers, with equally impressive methods. <br/><br/>Surrounding the nearly non-stop action is an interesting mix of supporting characters, including Ian McShane as the owner of a hotel for assassins, whose roles dictate that no business be conducted on the premises, and Willem Dafoe as Wick's mentor, Marcus, himself an expert sharpshooter. And we can't forget Adrianne Palicki, a fellow contract killer out to collect the $2 million bounty placed on Wick's head by Tarasov's father, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), who also happens to be Wick's former employer.<br/><br/>Stahelski, who first doubled for Reeves on The Matrix before moving on to several other films with the actor, including Constantine, Man of Tai Chi and both Matrix sequels, has teamed up with longtime collaborator David Leitch for John Wick, a stylish revenge thriller that heralds the arrival of a bold new voice. While Stahelski is credited as the director due to DGA regulations, this is very much a team effort, as Stahelski and Leitch have channeled their decades of experience as stunt coordinators and second unit directors into a remarkably original film that boasts some of the best action sequences in recent memory.<br/><br/>While John Wick certainly isn't a perfect film - the script is paper-thin in more than a few places, and Reeves has a handful of laughably poor dialogue deliveries - it never stops having fun. This is a film that refuses to take itself seriously, opting instead to just strap in, buckle up and enjoy the ride. And as long as audiences can follow suit, rather than searching for some deeper meaning, they should find themselves pleased with the results.<br/><br/>-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com"

Except as the old lady in the Nationwide commercial laments - This is NOT how it works !! This is not how any of this works !!

","John Wick is an instant classic action film. It doesn't have a crazy plot that makes it easy to get lost its just basic. You don't have to wait long for the action to begin and when it starts it goes pretty much right through to the end. I really hope that this is the beginning of a franchise because it certainly looks that way. I hope this film gets some attention because I didn't hear much talk about it and its run in the theater went by fairly quietly (although it did make 50 million bucks of profit). It also great to see Keanu Reeves find a role that seems to spark a comeback for him. Keanu has been a huge action star for over 20 years and its nice to see him back on top. John Wick may become one of his significant roles in the future."
"bravesfanc","7","9","19","4 February 2015"," An action film to enjoy
","An ex-assassin loses his wife to cancer, her last gift to him is probably the worlds cutest dog. This lasts for maybe a day or two as a couple young punks break into his home, kill his dog and steal his car. Turns out the guys who did this too him is the son of his former boss. Now you learn throughout the movie that John Wick is known by just about everyone in town. So why this kid didn't know who he was is dumb but its what makes the story take off.<br/><br/>John Wick is an action film that you need to just sit back, watch and enjoy. Don't nitpick at the little things. Such as the dialogue being a little bit corny, or the many cliché's that occur. This movie has fantastic gun fight choreography. In my opinion, its in the top 10 for gun fights. I also liked the world they created. The world of contract killers was different from what I had seen in the past.<br/><br/>The good guy is a likable character and you feel for him. You also despise the bad guys especially the son. Bottom line, its a good time and if you like action films, I highly recommend it."

","John Wick is a topnotch, taut, wildly entertaining action flick. It is stripped down, precise, and slick. Wick has style akin to Michael Mann's Collateral but trims some of the philosophical edge off. There are multiple uses of well-timed awkward humor even. You might laugh, you might cry, but you will be entertained, and isn't that what we want? Maximus Decimus Meridius knew it, so he told the Romans in Gladiator.<br/><br/>John Wick is the best assassin out for vengeance film I've seen since Lee Jeong-beom's The Man From Nowhere, released in 2010 and available on Netfilx streaming service now, I highly recommend it. The film begins with John falling out of the driver's seat of an SUV badly wounded and bleeding from his abdomen, it looks as though it is the end. We then travel back to a time when this man had peace and harmony in his life until his wife died from a terminal disease. As a parting gift he receives one day from a delivery service a beagle pup. John is able to grieve and heal his spirit taking care of this new fella' in his life. One day he is filling his bad ass 1969 Boss Mustang up as some young cocky Russian man offers to buy it, John declines and drives away. The Russian doesn't take no for an answer.<br/><br/>In a night raid at John's home the gangsters get the better of him and kill the puppy in the process but not Mr. Wick. This is their death sentence. John comes out of retirement and systematically works his way through these mafia thugs as an art form. As Christopher Walken speaks of his friend Creasy in Man On Fire; ""A man can be an artist in anything, Creasey's art is death."" John Wick is an artist of death, everything he picks up is a weapon, but especially guns. Director John Woo may be credited with inventing his so-called 'bullet ballet', but John Wick wields guns the way the fabled samurai handled their katana. You could call it Gun Fu, but not the unreal type seen in Equilibrium.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves really gets a chance to let lose in this and I loved it. By the time he says the line ""I'm thinking I'm back!"" you'll want to stand up and cheer. He gets to use some of the Kung Fu he's been adept at since The Matrix along with the gunplay, and even some good driving stunts where he is clearly the one driving and not a stunt driver. Willem Dafoe who is one of my favorite actors has a good supporting role as a fellow hit-man who's known John a long time. The Russian mafia kingpin is played by Mikael Nyqvist, who was Mikael Blomkvist in the Swedish film adaptations of Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy (known here as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). He is menacing and understandably angry with his son for bringing John's wrath upon them.<br/><br/>If you like no apologies action films this is for you. There's even the obligatory, exclusive-techno-nightclub shootout scene through a crowded dance floor. If you're still reading you should stop and get to your local cinema to see Mr. Wick in fine lethal form."

","Being a long time fan of action movies, i watched this based on the positive reviews.<br/><br/>If you are not in your teens, don't be fooled. Don't waste your time. Want a good Keanu action movie? Go watch The Matrix, even if it's your 100th viewing, it's still a lot better than this.<br/><br/>I read in a lot of reviews that this is an action movie, so you don't have to expect it to have a great story or some crazy plot twist. I believe that this is exactly the point!!! Maybe you are right, a great plot it is not necessary (Pacific Rim was pretty enjoyable even with a really simplistic plot), but what is necessary is internal coherence. And this movie, has many have noted has absolutely zero. Everyone seems to basing their actions on stupidity. Your enemy has killed like 40 or 50 of your men? Let's capture him and keep him alive! Someone came to kill you in the middle of the night? Her name is near yours in the ending credits, so let's capture her and keep her alive!<br/><br/>Bottom line is, if you show a world of ruthless killers, let them at least be ruthless!<br/><br/>so if you are considering looking at this... watch something else. Or play a video game, you will find more fun and a better plot.<br/><br/>Ps: I gave it 2 star only for the tattooed bartender! I think i'm in love! :D"

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","5","9","8 February 2019"," Non-stop action movie about a new kick-ass action hero on his mission of vengeance
","Yes I love John Wick to death it is a Non-stop action, I am a huge Keanu Reeves fan I love his movies. But John Wick from 2014 is one of my personal favorite action films of all time. It is bad-ass fast paced action revenge movie about a new kick-ass action hero one man army type. Directed was by Chad Stahelski and David Leitch who both did well job done. The story, the action, the gun blaze action is all in here. Explosions heavy automatic weapons who are used well.<br/><br/>The only thing I did not like are the characters not all, but some of the characters I did not like in here and I did not care for. One of the reasons is why I have enjoy the sequel much more it was more creative and passed than the original John Wick. The was made for 20 million budget in 2014 and made 40 million in the US. Keanu Reeves, Adrianne Palicki, John Leguizamo, Willem Dafoe and Michael Nyqvist R.I.P. did a good job playing their characters.<br/><br/>A retired assassin seeks vengeance against a mobster's son and his cronies for stealing his car and killing his puppy, a final gift from his deceased wife.<br/><br/>This is a revenge film about retired professional lethal assassin who retired years ago with honor for his wife. He made impossible job for Russian Gangster to get out. His wife died by a disease after the funeral John received a present a beautiful puppy from his wife. When sadistic young Russian thugs senselessly attack John Wick and kill his puppy and the last hope of redemption. John bury his puppy and armed him self like an one man army as Schwarzenegger Commando and goes after bad guys like a pure bad-ass he is. He kills all hit-mans who try to take him out until he get's the mobster son.<br/><br/>One of the best bad-ass action films of all time since 2014 the same time come out The Equalizer with Denzel Washington and that movie sucked I hated it. It was major disappointment John Wick proved it was no major disappointment but it was major improvement or lack of actions today. This movie was old school action with no shaky cam. So creativity in which in the movie is seen The Continental for members of the city's underworld. It is frequented by many hit-men and notorious murderers who live by code and rules in this hotel, if they break those rules, they die on horrible way and they are revoked. That is what I mean we see a world with assassins members who live in The Continental Hotel.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves become new kick-ass action hero on his own mission of vengeance. I am a huge Keanu Reeves fan I love this movie to death, I love Keanu's performance and also Keanu does not want the movie become a spin off or series. This movie should have three movies so that trilogy will end well. I support Keanu Reeves so much from The Matrix movies, Speed, Constantine, Street Kings and John Wick both of the films I love those movies to death.<br/><br/>Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins was great villain as lethal assassin who was hired by Viggo Tarasov to kill John Wick that is one of the reasons why I love this film to death. The fight between Ms. Perkins and John Wick is bad-ass I love it. I love Ms. Perkins to death I love, love, love and admire Adrianne Palicki so much.<br/><br/>John Leguizamo had a little role in the movie but I like him and Willem Dafoe plays a lot of characters villains such a Green Goblin / Norman Osborn in Spider-Man and John Geiger in Speed 2: Cruise Control. Most memorable to me is Sgt. Elias in Platoon (1986) who plays a good guy and in this movie he plays Marcus a retired assassin and a friend of John Wick who saves John Wicks life.<br/><br/>I love the beautiful songs played in the movie Killing Strangers by Marilyn Manson feat Tyler Bates, In My Mind - M86 ft. Susie Q, Think by Kaleida, Who You Talkin' to Man? by Ciscandra Nostalghia it has beautiful songs in the movie I love. The movie has tons of action , multiple explosions and tons of bullets fired. The film wouldn't be an action movie without some action there is plenty of it. You see a lot of car chases and cars flying over cliff stunt-man is crazy driven a car in the movie.<br/><br/>John Wick is about entertaining action about a world of assassins who lives by the rules of The Continental is all about the action and it goes above and beyond in every respect. John Wick has the potential to be the next great action franchise. This is my personal favorite action film I would defiantly put between The Terminator and the Rambo movies. The original John Wick movie is a creative action revenge movie that goes beyond the limits. I wish we would get action movies like this more. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc in my collection."

","I don't think most of the people who write bad reviews on this movie seem to grasp the fact that he's been retired for a couple years so when it comes to fighting he's not as good as he used to be. Second the reason Viggo's son doesn't know about wick is because he's young and all the other gangsters have been around a lot longer than him, plus everyone thought wick was retired so why would they tell the son about a retired guy? Lastly in my opinion an action movie would be quite boring if the protagonist won every single fight perfectly without so much as a scratch. Overall in my opinion it was a great movie.

The film may not be perfect or Great but it is a fun action packed film that Never gets boring. The acting was good from everyone and I liked the John Wick character despite the fact that he used to be a hit man. John was just a very cool character he's a character you will route for while watching this movie I know I did. This film has no major problems in my opinion.the only negative thing I can say about the film is the story was not great or original but who cares about originality when a film is this action packed!. This is one of the most action packed films I've seen all year!.it was just as good as captain America the winter soldier.<br/><br/>The story to John Wick is pretty simple it's about a retired hit man who loses his wife and he is so miserable after losing her that he wants to leave his old life behind. John Wick tries to leave behind his old life and just be a normal guy and he receives a gift from someone which turns out to be a puppy and his wife wanted him to have it when she passed away,it was her final gift to him. John Wick bonds with the puppy and grows to really like it but one night a group of gangsters break into his house and kill his dog and beat him up then they steal his car and get away.<br/><br/>The next day the boy tells his dad what he did and his Dad figures out who the person is and tells his son that he messed with the wrong man!.we find out the boys dad is actually a gangster too and he knows a lot of dangerous people including John wick. I love the dialogue he spoke.(its not what you did son it's WHO you did it to.) That nobody.that nobody is John Wick!.Nobody messes with John Wick!. The son says I'm not afraid of John Wick.The Dad says you should Be.then the boy says who is he the bogeyman?.The dad says he's not the bogeyman he's the man you send to kill the bogeyman!.I thought that was really funny dialogue and I laughed at that.<br/><br/>The film has touches of dark humour in it which I liked but the best thing about this film is the Badass over the top action!. John Wick basically goes after the same men that attacked him and killed his dog,he's angry and he wants vengeance and he takes his vengeance and beats up and kills dozens of gangsters. Without a doubt John Wick is one of the coolest gangster revenge films I've ever seen.the fight scenes were well choreographed and the directing and editing were also good and the film has a good idea about a motel for hit men which I thought was funny. <br/><br/>In all honesty John Wick is more of a serious film and not a funny one but I noticed small bits of Dark humour in it. One of the best scenes in the movie is when John Wick shoots and beats up dozens of people in the night club!. John Wick just blows his way past all of them! Like a killing machine! and he keeps going until he gets to the boy that killed his dog. The story may sound ridiculous but it's not,it actually WORKS in this film because of the seriousness of the situation. John Wick also has fun lines of dialogue like people keep on asking me if I'm back well yeah I'm thinking I'm back!. <br/><br/>John Wick knows how to fight and he is a Badass killing machine in this movie! And I wanted him to get his revenge on the gangsters that ruined his life. John Wick was a brutal character but he's also a character you want to see kick ass and get revenge because the bad guys deserve it. Basically the John wick character snaps and goes on a massacre. It was obvious that losing his wife was hard enough for him but when he lost his dog too it sent him over the edge which is why he did what he did. To sum things up the film has good fight scenes and good gun fights. There is never a boring moment in this film it's pacing is great it was always moving and it was a blast to watch.it is a very Entertaining Badass Action Film!."
"CinemaClown","Null","11","26","28 November 2014"," Welcome Back, Mr. Reeves! Welcome Back!
","Absolutely remorseless, purely unadulterated & downright violent from start to finish, John Wick is possibly the most stylishly crafted, feverishly paced, seamlessly executed, intensely entertaining & immensely satisfying action flick to come out from Hollywood after a very long time which, apart from marking a welcome return to action for Keanu Reeves, also triumphs as one of the biggest cinematic surprises of the year, not to mention the coolest by far.<br/><br/>Very refined in its visual presentation, taking a no-holds-barred approach with its content & providing heavy doses of pulse-pounding entertainment that many viewers will want to revisit again n again, John Wick is amongst the most impressive looking motion pictures of the year that takes its simple premise to an unexpected high, thanks to its kinetic direction, breathtaking action, neat cinematography, slick editing & a magnificent lead performance from Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of its titular character who used to be an ultimate assassin but retired to take care of his dying wife. Losing her to cancer, he receives a posthumous gift from her in the form of a puppy, with whom he eventually connects. Things are set in motion when few Russian thugs invade his home to steal his car but also end up beating him & killing his dog. And so the ex-hit-man comes out of his retirement to unleash carnage on the gangsters who took everything away from him.<br/><br/>Produced & directed by the first time filmmakers in Chad Stahelski & David Leitch, who until now had worked in the film industry as stunt coordinators, John Wick marks a stunning directional debut for both of them & is a spectacular start to their filmmaking careers. And Derek Kolstad's screenplay doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise or introducing its characters & gets right down on business from the start by telling just enough about Wick to get the plot moving.<br/><br/>Technically, there is a lot to admire about John Wick as the film exhibits an otherworldly setting for a revenge thriller that makes minimal use of elements not relevant to the plot. Camera-work makes its mark in the close-combat sequences for it provides a clear view of the carnage & isn't ruined by excessive editing or shaky cam. Editing paces the story with vicious velocity while its cool soundtrack further enhances the experience by remaining in tone with the film's events.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the film features a capable cast in Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo & others, amongst which both Reeves & Dafoe end up impressing the most. With a character that's tailor-made for his talent & combined with his magnetic screen presence, Reeves delivers a swashbuckling performance & easily steals the show. Dafoe follows him close & despite his short role, manages to leave his mark.<br/><br/>Yet the best thing about John Wick remains its action sequences that are stupendously carried out. With its debutant directors already well-versed in the field of action choreography & stunt work, the two manage to add new freshness to the combat sequences by nicely blending its gunplay with grounded martial arts to single-handedly elevate John Wick into the league of cinema's finest action entertainers to come out in recent years.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, John Wick is a smart, sophisticated & incredibly well-polished cinema that nicely balances its high-octane action & finely enacted drama to succeed as a potent, kinetic & relentless entertainer. Helmed by two new directors who understand what great action is about, boasting a script that knows where to draw the line & spearheaded by Keanu Reeves' badass performance, John Wick is an instant classic that comes as a must for every action film fanatic out there.<br/><br/>Welcome back, Mr. Reeves! Welcome back!"

","The movie was one Kick-Ass movie, I recommend it to everyone! (SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>The special effects were off the chart (still had to close my eyes for a fair amount of the head shots). On top of that, the wrestling maneuvers and the focused shots were a thing of beauty - EXCELLENT choreography. Damn it, Keanu you just keep getting better and better. Lolol<br/><br/>Watching the Mustang fly was just beautiful - I pray he got to keep her - WOW! Beautiful '69. The SS Camero, isn't my favorite by a long shot - clunky tanks, but if you got to go out on manhunt maneuvers, you might as well as have one of the toughest, civilian tanks with you - especially if it had the positraction. :) The last car, a gift from the hotel, was a blank slate - both in it's lack of detail, and my knowledge of new cars. Fortunately, I saw one on the way home and it ended up being a Dodge Challenger. Blew me away and it was a real crime to see it get pushed over the side of the dock. The car was just a thing of beauty.<br/><br/>The plot was unassuming, romantic and sentimental and perfectly in line with the main character - an assassin who bought his way out of a nightmare shitty world into of normalcy for the Ultimate Meaning of Life - Love. If you spent most of your life with your emotions completely cut off, what would you do to keep that emotional connection alive? Cut out the maggot promoters of that worthless life, and regain the emotional connection that helps you live? ""Hell, Yeah.""<br/><br/>In this case, a gang of old-school Russian pigs, not unlike some I've met in the past, but thankfully rarely exists today. Since the John Wick story is a case of self-protection and a commitment to family emotional ties, it fit perfectly with our Texan philosophy. A woman would do well to have such a man as the John Wick character to protect the one gift she gave him - Love. The death of the long-haired vixen and the manhunt of the sniveling Ruski, was just icing on the cake. Bottom-feeders, self-promoters and stealers of lives - well, enough said.<br/><br/>Get out there and see this movie. You will love it ! ! !"
"goods116","6","13","32","2 November 2014"," Monotonous and tedious, this movie is way overrated
","This movie was watchable, but seriously an 8? Again, I find these ratings are given out of context, meaning that it's not being compared to other movies. The plot is basically a hit man is wronged and kills everyone in the mob gang who wronged him. That's basically it. How many times can we watch Keanu Reeves kill someone with a gun? The idea that 40 gunmen can't stop him is also ridiculous. Why didn't they post two snipers in that club who would shoot him as soon as he entered. Really, no one other human, no matter how many, can hit this man with a gun? It all gets super repetitive and ridiculous. By the end it was just boring. Yes, good acting, good filming, etc. it get's all that, and the ""world"" they created was OK, the only reason it gets a 6 not a 4 or 5. Really, skip this one."

","I'm done marginalizing film tastes in terms of gender<br/><br/>is originally how I began this review.<br/><br/>Yet it's the antithesis of my gut response to John Wick:<br/><br/>""Highly recommend for mainly male moviegoers,"" my heart mentions as the credits roll.<br/><br/>The cranium cogs start whirling.<br/><br/>""Isn't that rhetoric unproductive? Shouldn't we discourage that type of thinking?"" my intellectual side fires back.<br/><br/>Thus prompting the rough introduction.<br/><br/>While reviewing J. Wick on The Screen Rant Underground, two of the hosts offer a counterargument in mentioning their wives' dislike. One goes so far as to say she 'hated it.'<br/><br/>(Side Note: The words 'hate' and 'boring' are the two most overused descriptors in the English language.)<br/><br/>'Violence' and 'Romance' occupy the extremities of the gender Venn diagram.<br/><br/>Men prefer fighting; women prefer feeling. Simple as that, folks.<br/><br/>""It's a social construct! The best movies lie in the diagram's center! To mention the pattern is to perpetuate it!"" the brain chimes in.<br/><br/>The inescapable reality is: The paradigm exists.<br/><br/>Whether I like it or not.<br/><br/>To put an untidy bow on my point: Isn't it stilted claiming a movie is excellent (better than great), but for male audiences only? Doesn't that imply John Wick is terrible, if viewed by a female audience?<br/><br/>Surely there are women who enjoy gun-fu. Shouldn't they feel insulted by the suggestion?<br/><br/>Anyhow; you catch my drift.<br/><br/>Here's my Top Five Movies with the Protagonist's Full Name as the Title –<br/><br/>1. Donnie Darko 2. Annie Hall 3. Forrest Gump 4. Happy Gilmore 5. Billy Madison<br/><br/>John Wick is similar to Denzel Washington's character from last month's The Equalizer.<br/><br/>Both protagonists are similar to Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher, who is also an ex-CIA agent.<br/><br/>Say what you will about his surfing abilities in Point Break, Keanu Reeves is terrific as the leading hombre.<br/><br/>Keanu's John's less virtuous, and less lady-magnet than Tom's Jack, but they both can drive in reverse like champions.<br/><br/>Which marks the first of three lessons I learned from J.W. about firearms.<br/><br/>Lesson 1) If you must drive at enemy gunfire, do so in reverse.<br/><br/>Keanu's acting is great. Soft-spoken and pragmatic; sympathy sits with him quite nicely.<br/><br/>Plus he does all his own fighting and stunts.<br/><br/>In the hand-to-hand combat; the viewer can tell he's absorbing all the blows. He falls off a balcony!<br/><br/>Keanu's just terrific.<br/><br/>The action scenes are phenomenal.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire film, the epic fight sequences rival the best in cinematic history.<br/><br/>The gunplay is realistic and grounded. You've never seen such concrete shootouts.<br/><br/>Lesson 2) Due to recoil, hand-held assault rifles can only be fired in bursts.<br/><br/>Wick manages to dispatch a number of thugs in an organic fashion.<br/><br/>It especially illustrates the possibilities for less cutting, and more believable action in the film industry.<br/><br/>Lesson 3) Those who wield a pistol at the ready (like a cop entering the home of a serial killer) live longest.<br/><br/>The stuntwork is absolutely spectacular; far too much fiddling with convention to mention.<br/><br/>During an explosion, there is an actual stuntman in the foreground nearby the exploding material.<br/><br/>He catches fire! It's awesome!<br/><br/>Who doesn't love John Leguizamo? Talk about reliable.<br/><br/>Alfie Allen catches critical heat for playing a similar role on Game of Thrones, which is unnecessary. He does a fine job for what he's cast as.<br/><br/>Good to see WCW's Kevin Nash playing a small part.<br/><br/>Ian McShane is terrific as always. Somebody's not paying him enough.<br/><br/>Willem DeFoe plays a man who serves vegetable puree rather than booze at a meeting of criminal wits. Yet another shiny bullet on DeFoe's lengthy list.<br/><br/>Adrianne Palicki plays a solid murderess.<br/><br/>Ironically enough, the only time I was 'taken out of' the movie is during footage of her stunt double.<br/><br/>Finally, the off-type villain is performed excellently by Michael Nyqvist.<br/><br/>John Wick may be the poster-child for breaking cliché; which is shaping up to be the number one theme for cinema 2014.<br/><br/>Catch it in IMAX while it's still in theaters.<br/><br/>There's no stinger after the credits roll.<br/><br/>But hey. I'd be down for a sequel."

The directors of the film David Leitch and Chad Stahelski both do a excellent and fantastic job of directing this movie and I found out that these two are actually stunt men. The villain was good, the action scenes were shot perfectly. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie felt a bit cliché for me. You know in every action movie that the main hero is facing off the main bad guy and they shouting out one liners at each other, you know what I mean and that to me felt like the writer's got lazy half way through.<br/><br/>John Wick has to be the biggest surprise for me with it's intelligent writing and nail biting action scenes."
"zardoz-13","8","12","29","4 November 2014"," Wicked!!!
","Never kill an action hero's dog! All hell breaks loose in the sadomasochistic, R-rated, revenge-thriller ""John Wick"" because the malevolent villains not only steal our hero's 'to die for' vintage 1969 Mustang, but they also murder his dog. Had these unsavory felons had contented themselves with the Mustang, they might have survived the ordeal. Watching the ferociously violent ""John Wick"" rekindled memories of director Antoine Fuqua's conspiracy theory thriller ""Shooter"" (2007) where the villains made the fatal mistake of killing Mark Wahlberg's dog. Bob Lee Swagger, the Wahlberg hero in ""Shooter,"" cleaned everybody's clock after he buried his dog. Basically, Keanu Reeves does the same thing to the heartless hooligans who slew his adorable puppy. ""John Wick"" pits our resilient hero against the malignant Russian mafia infesting New York City like a cancer; much like Denzel Washington did in ""The Equalizer."" Most of the ruffians who died in ""The Equalizer"" perished off-screen, and we were shown their twisted bodies sprawled like blood-stained laundry after the fact. Unlike Denzel's sympathetic, good-guy vigilante, Keanu Reeves is cast as a retired Russian hit-man who exterminates everybody in sight without a qualm. Along the way, our hero has his nose bloodied, his ribs kicked in, and stitches sewn up in his stomach. ""Matrix"" stuntman turned film director Chad Stahelski has taken scenarist Derek Kolstad's formulaic, B-movie screenplay and fashioned it into a cynical, rapid-fire, actioneer with the double-digit body count of Asian director John Woo's classic ""Hard Boiled."" If you haven't heard of John Woo, then ""John Wick"" is comparable to the two Gareth Evans' hard-knuckled, non-stop thrillers ""The Raid"" (2012) and ""The Raid 2"" (2014). Kolstad's larger-than-life script recalls venerable genre classics like the Lee Marvin shoot'em up ""Point Blank"" (1967) and the hard-as-nails Mel Gibson movie ""Payback"" (1999). A lone gunman in both ""Point Blank"" and ""Payback"" wipes out the mob in a metropolitan city. If you cannot tolerate seeing dozens of gunmen getting riddled with bullets, you should skip ""John Wick."" After a string of forgettable, half-baked thrillers and fantasies, including ""The Day The Earth Stood Still,"" ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,"" ""Man of Tai Chi,"" and ""47 Ronin,"" Reeves appears to have recovered his poise with this high body count, pistol opera.<br/><br/>The hard-bitten Keanu Reeves title character hung up his hardware after he fell in love with Helen (Bridget Moynahan of ""Battle Los Angeles""), an angel in disguise who saved him from a life of crime. Unfortunately, she succumbed to a fatal illness and died at the hospital with John at her bedside. Before she passed away, Helen has the presence of mind to write a farewell card to her husband and attach it to a pet taxi containing a cute, floppy-eared puppy. Our dry-eyed hero weeps at the memory of his long, lost wife and prepares a place at the foot of his bed for Daisy. One day while Wick is fueling up his Mustang with gasoline, a carload of rude Russians cruise in to the convenience store. One of the Russians, Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen of ""Atonement""), admires Wick's ride and asks him how much he would sell it for. ""It's not for sale,"" Wick replies without a second thought. When Iosef mutters in Russian that everything has a price, Wick rebuts him in Russian that his Mustang is not for sale. Later that evening, after he has gone to bed alone, Wick awakes as Daisy starts barking and scampers off the bed and downstairs. No sooner has Wick followed Daisy to investigate the disturbance in his sleek, ultra-modern house than he is knocked down and violently beaten up. The three thieves confiscate his car keys, and Iosef kills poor Daisy. Later, Iosef and his accomplices careen into an automobile chop shop run by Aureilo (John Leguizamo of ""Carlito's Way"") for new papers and a VIN number. Areola refuses to accommodate them. He goes so far as to punch Iosef in the face. Iosef's father Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist of ""London Voodoo"") offers his son a drink and then slams his fist into Iosef's stomach so his son vomits on the floor. Viggo tells Isoef that Isoef has made a fatal mistake. Viggo explains that John Wick consolidated Viggo's empire before Wick retired. Viggo witnessed Wick kill three ruffians in a bar with nothing but a pencil. Unfortunately, we don't see Wick repeat this rather astonishing act. Nevertheless, Wick is a crack shot with any kind of gun and drives a car like a racer. Immediately, Viggo hires the next best hit-man alive, Marcus (William Dafoe of ""The Boondock Saints""), but sets up the contract on a first-come/first-sell basis for anybody. Like I said earlier, all Hell breaks loose, and everybody relies on the same clean-up crew to mop up the blood, bodies, and broken glass.<br/><br/>Naturally, ""John Wick"" is barely believable. This is a slam-bang, shoot'em up done with a straight face and a cast of familiar faces dodging bullets in New York City. Everybody wears body armor and packs extra pistols. When John Wick shoots an adversary, he puts at least three slugs in each adversary with a coup de grace to the head. Sure, blood splashes from these wounds, but it isn't gratuitous like ""Saving Private Ryan."" Stahelski stages everything as if he were directing a Spaghetti western. Bodies spin, topple, and stagger. Here and there, Stahelski slips in a surprise or two because John Wick may be indestructible, but the Russian mobsters aren't totally asinine. ""John Wick"" isn't strictly about guys with guns. Actress Adrianne Palicki shows that gals can be just as lethal with firearms, too. British tough guy Ian McShane of ""Deadwood"" fame makes a memorable appearance as the owner of an off-limits nightclub motel who doesn't cater to killers killing killers on his premises. Although it isn't wholly original and is often predictable, ""John Wick"" qualifies as a sizzling saga with slimy villains and lots of kinetic, bullet-piercing action."

","When disease takes the wife of former contract killer John Wick, he can find no respite apart from a dog, gifted to him by his wife so that he will have something to focus his love on, to prevent him from slipping back into his former dark ways. A chance encounter with a Russian thug sees Wick's connection to this life severed, and he sets out for vengeance – a path that will take him up against the most powerful criminal gang in the city.<br/><br/>Although it does start with a satisfyingly meaty emotional base, this film is one long action sequence of impossible acts and violence (with Wick seemingly looking to get extra XP from headshots). There is of course a limit to the appeal of this, but it is hard not to enjoy the mindless dark heart of this whole film, as it relentlessly drives forward with little thought of external logic, instead selling itself hard and fast throughout. Mostly this approach works; with minimal set-up it is not long before the violence begins in earnest, and it is solidly and stylishly done throughout, with slick design and satisfying set-pieces. The style does help because, with Wick being pretty much the Terminator, it is not always easy to feel any tension from peril, so instead we get the tension from the relentlessness and the speed of movement.<br/><br/>Reeves is a good lead for this, since it does essentially require him to be emotionless and enigmatic – both of which he can pull off. He is surrounded by familiar faces, all of whom feel like maybe they were wasted by being in the film for only short times each, but all of which give the film a sense of quality – and everyone does produce something even if they only have one or two scenes (also fun for fans of The Wire to see the couple of faces showing up). All told, this is not the reinvention of action movies (as some have said) but it just a reminder of how they should be done well – enough emotional grit for us to care, and then good solid relentless action the rest of the way. It is nonsense, as so much of this genre is, but it is visceral, tough, dark, and really quite fun."

At the end it was soo bad I had to skip the part where he had to kill the boss. Why would I continue watching this garbage I already knew he will kill the boss and all blah blah blah.The director really wanter rain and go it but he really wanted the 2 guys wounded to be wasted and look at each other like any big action and he got it but he had to find a way to injure John Wick and could not find a way so John guy himself so he can be down on the ground with the boss looking at each other .This was the funniest moment ever.I did not watch the entire fight I skip to that part and was curious how John Got hurt by that old boss so I had to watch that joke again so yeaa ok John Hurt himself.LOL I really hopped John Wick to be my new 3 part favorite movie but I will never watch the other 2 parts.Sorry, this is a plain dumb movie.ahahah what was this?some kind of new comedy LOL"
"barberoux-15943","2","4","7","11 July 2017"," Disturbing
","Here's the story. A local moronic tough guy, and his cohorts, break into a guy's house and steal his car and kill his puppy. The guy gathers up all of his weapons and goes out to public venues and slaughters people for revenge. How often have we heard this story? Of course in real life the venues are shopping malls, schools or clubs and the perpetrator is usually portrayed as a troubled, loner. John Wick in this movie is a hero who killed a bunch of bad guys with precise placement of bullets. Of course in real life the bullets are sprayed helter-skelter, by a sideways held gun, and often kill innocent bystanders or children. The fact that bullets, when they miss the intended target, don't dissipate into thin air seems to be lost to many people. There are innocent people slaughtered daily due to perceived social slights and minor insults resolved with gun violence and this movie glorifies widespread killing. Obviously I found this movie disturbing. I can see a movie like this and be disturbed by the message but others, maybe of marginal mental capacities, ingest the message as righteous behavior. A recent local road rage incident was in the news where a high school graduate was shot in the head over lane merging jockeying. And this movie, promoting vigilante gun violence, was praised by critics. What the hell is wrong with this country?"
"peterp-450-298716","7","7","15","13 February 2015"," Action,action,action,action and a bit more action !
","""John will come for you and you will do nothing, because you can't do nothing."" <br/><br/>Do you hate complicated films where your brains hurt while trying to keep up with the story ?Do you start to drool spontaneously when watching endless violent action scenes? You answered twice ""Yes Sir""? Well,then ""John Wick"" is cut out for you.Because the story is simple in a way that even your goldfish can follow it easily and it it contains a concatenation of rough,cruel liquidations.I never thought that stealing a Ford Mustang and wringing the neck of a puppy could result in a never-seen,raging revenge.John Wick thought otherwise. This retired former hit-man leaves a bloody trail in New York,after they steal his car and kill his dog,donated by his deceased wife.The fact that this is committed by the son of his former boss,who's from the Russian mob, doesn't impress him.Instantly he demolishes his basement floor.Years ago,he buried his whole arsenal of weapons and other adult toys there,just to forget his past and change gear in his new life.<br/><br/>Digging up Keanu Reeves again,certainly wasn't a bad idea.The man has a natural talent for portraying an icy cool killer.His emotionless visage is perfect for the role.And the less dialogs in a film,the better.It's not the dialogs, he has to struggle through,that gives him the appearance of a cold-blooded assassin,but his stoic calmness and the expressionless gaze does.He demonstrated this already in ""The Matrix"" and also in ""47 Ronin"" (wrongly considered by many as a pulp film).If you want to keep track of the number of victims,you should purchase a large oversize abacus.I enjoy a straightforward action film,with not to much frills and where the emphasis lies on mindless brawling and shooting.It shouldn't be serious all the time.Although after a while I felt kind of impassive about it and sank deeper into my cozy seat to watch it with such an infinite look.I compared it with a ride on a wildly popular, matchless roller-coaster.During your first ride,you feel the adrenaline rushing through your body and you rush back to the entrance full of enthusiasm just to experience that indescribable feeling once again.During the tenth drive you're sitting in it very relaxed,looking around in search for the next challenge. That's ""John Wick"" in a nutshell.A flashy roller-coaster ride that starts fiery and impressive,but as the journey takes longer,the euphoria fades away slowly.<br/><br/>In terms of genre, it's ultimately of the same level as ""The Equalizer"". Only the latter contained a bit more story, I thought. In ""John Wick"" you have a stolen car and a dead dog on the one hand, and on the other hand an increasing number of corpses. That's it. And yet it's pure enjoyment witnessing the flashy action and shown coolness. Chad Stahelski, a former stuntman (interesting fact: he was the one who played Neo in ""The Matrix"" during dangerous scenes), doesn't beat around the bush and creates a series of precisely choreographed fight sequences. Without much effort he succeeds in giving Reeves the reputation of a Boogeyman. But as Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) remarks it himself: ""John is not exactly ""The Boogeyman"". He's the one you sent to kill the 'Boogeyman."". And this top assassin moves in a swirling way to eliminate his enemies with a well-aimed shot. His shooting technique is slightly off-track and looks somewhat forced. But that doesn't keep him from transforming the place where he appears, into an outright shooting gallery.<br/><br/>There were some pretty surreal scenes which impressed the imagination. Like the ""Continental"" hotel, the professional cleaning team and the reputation of John Wick in itself and his cult status hovering around him as an aura. ""The Continental Hotel"" could serve as a scenic design in a future Batman movie, which bathes in a real cartoon atmosphere. It's a famous meeting point for notorious assassins, with its own monetary system, an unnaturally friendly desk clerk that meets with all the needs of the guests and a resident physician who can be called for when guests return reasonable damaged after taking care of their ""business"". There is only one golden rule which is mercilessly punished after being violated. It's prohibited to arrange matters in the hotel itself.<br/><br/>For most of the supporting acts you can safely say that there's a total lack of character development. Most are no more than a shadow in this film, who come momentarily into view and then they're mercilessly being slaughtered. But it seems as if they are suffering from anemia, because despite the continuous aggression, there is very little blood splattered around. So only Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen (Iosef) and Willem Dafoe remain. Michael Nyqvist wasn't very convincing as Viggo and was at the times too theatrical. Alfie Allen played the well-known roll as the conceited, imagining-himself-being-untouchable son of a criminal who as he starts to realize what predator is hunting him, needs a larger size Pampers. Not that very original. And Willem Dafoe tries, but gets little screenplay to play himself into the spotlight. So Reeves is the only one to steal the show. And he does that with panache and style. Once he slips into that measured black suit and swings a duffel bag full of toys for adults in it, over his shoulder, he walks confidently towards you while the camera zooms in. And then you can brace yourself. Magnificent.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" isn't exactly of a high level in cinematic terms but does meet the requirements of the targeted audience. A pure action movie full of spectacle. Unfortunately, there are rumors that the sequel ""John Wick"" is planned already. I admire Reeves that he's still capable to portray a character as Wick at his age of 50. He can take that kind of personage to a next level, but I'm afraid that this sequel will be a weak carbon copy from the original.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be"
"moviexclusive","7","14","36","22 October 2014"," Keanu Reeves proves he is still on top of the game
","Keanu Reeves shot to superstardom in Speed and that was a stunning two decades ago. Five years after crashing a bus through LA, he reaffirmed his star status in the then groundbreaking sci-fi action flick, The Matrix. Since then, the actor of mixed ancestry has dabbled in a number of high-profile projects and indie titles, produced an acclaimed documentary and directed his very first feature. But he has yet found a role that ranked alongside Jack Traven and Neo.<br/><br/>All thanks to stunt coordinators and performers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (founders of action outfit, 87Eleven), Reeves has finally found a character that redefined his flagging career. Forgive his almost soulless appearance in 47 Ronin, you want a badass Keanu Reeves action vehicle, you have it in John Wick. The script by the little known Derek Kolstad reeks of minimalism. It's purely a lazy action movie, one that frankly never pushes beyond the boundary. Yet somehow it works under the hands of Leitch and Stahelski and the casting of our leading man.<br/><br/>With hardly a lull, Reeves plays a mysterious ex-assassin, a man so powerful at his craft that people jitters at the mere mention of his name. However, Wick decides to retire after his wife fell sick and after the death of his beloved partner, devoted his time to care for his pet dog – the last gift given by his late wife. Unfortunately, the son of a Russian mobster, Iosef (Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones) punctuates Wick's quiet life after he took a fancy to Wick's Ford Mustang. Isoef ambushed Wick at his home in the middle of the night, took his muscle car and gasp killed his dog! The ruthless act trigger the anger back in Wick and what follows is the ultimate revenge against those who are hired to stop him from killing Iosef and the target himself. <br/><br/>The movie is structured predictably that you already knew what's coming. To its credit, John Wick is never pretentious, it served to entertain and it accomplished its goal with much ease in the end. Leitch and Stahelski are such old-timers in the stunt field that most of the action seen in Wick is both beautifully and brutally executed. Men are often stabbed, kicked, disabled and shot in the face and to the talented production designers, the numerous action sequences actually took place in a number of different locations such as a disco club, parking lot and hotel room just to give it a little variety. The raw bloody gunplay reminisces one of early John Woo movies and it's definitely a visual feast. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela (Max Payne, A Good Day to Die Hard) provides the movie with a chilling moody feel at the same time, keeping his lenses glued to the ground forsaking the usage of crappy shaky cams.<br/><br/>Just when you thought Kolstad's storytelling is so uneventful, he manages to throw in surprises after surprises. Besides, the laugh- out-loud sardonic humour, the world of thugs, assassins in John Wick is much more than mere clichéd tough Russian mobsters, a promising setup for more sequels to come. Killers stayed in a luxurious hotel and they trade using only gold coins. A specialized crew is hired to clean up crime scenes and disposing the bodies. There are rules to abide with and everyone in this world comes with a price.<br/><br/>Besides Reeves doing his tough guy routine and should I add he is damn good at it, Bridget Moynahan (I, Robot) also has a small role as Wick's wife seen in a brief flashback montage. Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist (Ghost Protocol) plays the movie's main villain, Iosef's mobster daddy and he plays it uber-cool. Everyone's favourite character actors Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane play a fellow assassin and a mysterious hotel's owner respectively.<br/><br/>When it comes to voting for a stylish action packed movie for 2014, John Wick easily wins hands down. If you missed Denzel Washington hunting down Russian thugs in The Equalizer, then don't miss Keanu Reeves hunting down Russian thugs. It's just as crazy but with a dog in the latter, I declared John Wick the winner. Who can resist a cute puppy with Bambi eyes?"
"A_Different_Drummer","7","8","18","14 January 2015"," I think a DVD of this film comes with your AARP membership...
","On one level, a kind of cartoony action film for fans of KR.<br/><br/>On a deeper level, the films asks profound questions about valuable skills lost to society when competent people retire.<br/><br/>On an historical level this film may be an unintended tribute to director Michael Winner, who died the year it was in production.<br/><br/>This was exactly and precisely the sort of film that Winner specialized in, back in the glory days. Would have starred Charles Bronson (again, sadly, no longer with us).<br/><br/>Haters begone. If JCVD and Segal can keep churning out muck at a age when they should be in rocking chairs, let's give good old KR a little rope .. and then wait to see who he hangs with it."
"Robert_duder","8","11","27","17 November 2014"," Throw back action that was a ton of fun
","I went into John Wick nearly completely blind. I am certain I did not see a single trailer for it. I knew it had Keanu Reeves and I knew it was about a man out for vengeance when his dog is killed. It sounded almost silly but I expected there would be more to it and there was. Actually there is a whole lot of back story here and a million different directions this could go in if they chose to franchise it. Its a dark, twisted, violent, martial arts, action film that was often brilliantly choreographed and reminded me of perhaps a Luc Besson film or John Woo (only good...I'm not a Woo fan.) Its not quite an 80's action throwback but more of a 90's action throwback. Fans of The Matrix will rejoice in this return to that style of film for Reeves. The story is actually very good and you very quickly begin to understand just how dangerous John Wick is. Essentially you start the film knowing nothing about him but you quickly understand a little about his past and the world he ran in and how dangerous he is. One of the best things about John Wick is the world the film makers bother to create behind the story going on. You have a mysterious underground organization of hit men and women, a club that is a ""safe zone"" and a network of killers that rub elbows together. All of that collides into this blood bath and its insanely fun to watch.<br/><br/>I can't honestly say I've see Keanu Reeves in anything I was impressed with since Constantine. I feel like he often forgets what people love to see him in and that has always been action. This returns him to full form and he doesn't miss a beat. I don't know how much of his own stunts and fighting he does but he kicks some serious a$$ and looks great doing it. I would watch this film a second time just to catch some of the more intense moments. Alfie Allen is fantastic as the whiny privileged son of a mobster who crosses John Wick. You actually ache to watch Allen get destroyed and he's perfectly irritating in all the right ways. In order to make sure the story has a proper villain we have Michael Nyqvist as his father. He definitely has an air of villainy to him and he's the perfect adversary to Wick. You can just feel the history between the two characters. Willem Dafoe is fantastic in a small role as a fellow assassin. We know that he and Reeves also have history and we don't know what and we never really find out but we know there is a relationship there. Dean Winters is the perfect number one henchman and his role is perfectly used and placed, Adrianne Palicki is actually amazing as a seriously deranged female assassin (she could stand to have a whole movie on her alone), and honourable mentions to Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, and John Leguizamo in cameo roles that are really terrific. No matter how big or small a role in this film is, I thought they did a great job at establishing this world John Wick exists in and the circles he once ran in and with. I want more!! That is the best compliment I can give.<br/><br/>Now this is director Chad Stahelski's first directorial credit. This usually means a film reeks of inexperience. However, if you look at the sheer number of films that Stahelski has worked on in stunts and assistant directing and producing, you will see that he has been building an incredible resume of experience and John Wick proves that. He has a style that is near perfect this revenge type of martial arts film. I cringed, I nearly cried, I cheered, I veered, I didn't want it to end. Its not a critically brilliant film but its nearly perfectly entertaining. The story is a little predictable in the idea that a hit-man leaves the business because he falls in love only to be drawn back in when something terrible happens. That's not a new concept although his anger being triggered by the death of a puppy is a new angle. Action fans take note because if you haven't seen John Wick you are missing out!! This is a return to greatness for Reeves and I could easily watch this again and may even add it to my collection. It holds nothing back and lives up to its ""R"" Rated which is also unusual nowadays. Because of this film I anxiously await to see what Stahelski does next. 8.5/10"
"Matt_Layden","8","9","21","17 January 2015"," Please see this movie.
","John Wick is an interesting film that came and went before our eyes. Yet those who did decide to give it a chance, seem to love it very much. It's 'Certified Fresh' on Rottentomatoes and has a 7.5 rating on IMDb as of right now. Impressive for a film that is basically one shoot out after the next....after the next....after the next.<br/><br/>An ex hit-man comes out of retirement after he's attacked by three thugs in his home. This attack leaves him beaten, without a car and a dead dog, which was given to him by his recently deceased wife. Big mistake. Once these guys tries to sell the muscle car to a garage that strips parts, the owner seems to instantly recognize it. The man asks, who's car this is. Who cares? The young spoiled brat replies. I can tell you one thing, we beat his ass to get it, and his stupid dog too. Bam, punched in the face. The kid goes crying to his mob boss of a father, who then calls up that mechanic. Did you punch my son in the face? Yes sir, I did. Why, he asked. Well sir, because he stole John Wick's car...and killed his dog. <br/><br/>Oh crap.<br/><br/>This sets up the film, the classic revenge tale. Nothing really new here. We've seen dozens of films where the retired killer has to come out of retirement to revenge the death of a loved one. This time it happens to be a canine. The dog is adorably cute and my wife was in tears...TEARS I TELL YOU, when they killed the poor pup. About one scene before it happened, she says to me, ""Are they going to kill the dog?"" Terrified of the answer that I would not give her. Well, yes, they did. She instantly wanted John Wick to kill EVERYONE. So I guess when a dog gets it, you instantly want those responsible dead. Funny, I feel the same way. When people die on film, no big deal, but when an animal dies, all hell breaks lose. <br/><br/>After that is out of the way, John Wick suits up to take out those who have wronged him. It just happens to be the son of his former boss. So when the boss finds out, he knows he's in trouble. So now he has to get to Wick before Wick gets to them. Thus, the body count piles up. It piles up in a finely tuned operatic fashion, as the action sequences are some of the best in the last few years. Wick uses his guns with precision. Shot to the chest, then to the head. It's robotic. One man against a dozen? Fair fight.<br/><br/>To say the action in John Wick is stylized in an understatement. This is one of the best action films in years. Chad Stahelski, a stunt coordinator, makes his directing debut here. So he knows his way around a fight, being responsible for such films as the Expendables, The Wolverine, Tron: Legacy, and many many more. I like this new trend of giving people from different departments a chance at the directing chair. See what they can bring to the table. The man clearly knows his stuff, so give him a script to shoot and see what he can achieve. He nails it here. One impressive sequence has Wick going into a club, with multiple levels and rooms and takes out the bad guys one by one. First silently, then when all hell breaks lose, with calm and ease. Bottom line: This is one FUN film.<br/><br/>Reeves never impresses with his acting ability. It's kind of a running gag with people that he cannot act his way out of a paper bag. One scene here has him actually showing some emotion, which is when he reads the letter from his wife after receiving the dog. The rest of the film is how bad ass can Reeves look while taking out dozens of people. The answer, really bad ass. Familiar faces show up, such as Willem Dafoe, as another assassin. Adrianne Palicki as a beautiful....well...assassin. Michael Nyqvist, from the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series, plays the Russian Mobster, whose son, Alfie Allen aka Theon Greyjoy, gets him into this mess. As if we needed another reason to hate Theon. Finally Ian McShane as a friendly face in a crowd of so few. <br/><br/>The world created in John Wick is interesting to me. These assassins have gold coins that get them into these places that only the secret society of assassins can access. There are hidden clubs, hotel rooms, etc. How can all these assassins and hit-men be in a club and not want to shoot each other. Well, there seem to be certain rules. Don't break them, or there might be consequences. <br/><br/>Those club scenes are really fun. Jonathan Sela, the DOP, bathes the film is icy blues and nice neon lighting for those club scenes. Giving it a heightened look and feel. Everything about the film feels smooth as ice, just like John Wick. The directing style reflects the lead character. Aggressive when it needs to be, but calm and collected most of the time. When I say aggressive, boy do I mean aggressive. Wick acts like a man with nothing to lose, no fear. He will walk right into the lions den to get the job done. <br/><br/>John Wick is one of the biggest surprises of 2014 for me. While some might call it a no brainer repetitive action film I call it high class action fun. FUN is the key word here. Watching John Wick dispose of those bodies was fun. Seeing this society of people who all know each other was fun. Seeing Keanu Reeves back in the limelight doing what he does best? You called it...fun."
"StebbsUK","8","9","21","17 January 2015"," Slick, stylish action film which is worthy of its high rating
","Like many people I rely on IMDb ratings and reviews to make decisions about films I have heard little about. When I came to look at John Wick I was interested due to its overall rating of 7.5, but became rather concerned about the negative reviews from other users. I became convinced that the film had been wrongly rated and that the negative reviews were an honest description of faults many found with the film. However, there was such huge discrepancy between the comments being left that I decided to read the Rotten Tomatoes review - which gives the film an 83 and a very solid review. So, I decided Id give the film a try and make my own decisions - man am I glad I did!<br/><br/>John Wick is a slick, stylish action film which brings the protagonist out of retirement and returns him to the criminal world where he was once feared as an ultimate hit man. Everything about the film, from Keanu Reeves acting to car chases and gunfights is slick and thoroughly enjoyable. The script and storyline is relatively simple and you do need to read between the lines at points to understand fully. We are launched into a criminal world that has rules and a safe hotel where people like John Wick can stay, gain information, get rid of bodies, get patched up by a doctor and are safe to stay thanks to the owners rules that no hits are ever to be carried out on site. The owner is played by Ian McShane and the hotel manager by Lance Reddick - both giving superb cameo performances which help create the criminal world shown to us in this film.<br/><br/>The direction, photography and style of, what is essentially a simple revenge film, is fantastic and makes the film highly enjoyable. Yes, there are a few niggles, but the usual ones you find in action films - missing a target early on so that John Wick has reason to kill more people in his search for him. Also there appears to be the worst Police force in the world operating in this city as they never turn up, despite gang war breaking out on the streets and people walking around with assault rifles. The only police officer we meet turns a blind eye to John Wick's actions, so perhaps we are supposed to believe the other cops are doing the same. Other than that though, I completely disagree with all the points being made in the negative reviews posted by other users - I thought the fight scenes were exciting and quite visceral. As for the script - this was simple and minimalistic and at times perhaps you need to read between the lines a bits (maybe the negative reviewers were unable to do so?). For me the dialogue was perfect, fitted in with the style of the film and lines were delivered well by all the actors.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a really fun revenge story with slick action scenes and good acting from all involved. If you're looking for a simple revenge story which is a lot of fun, then I definitely recommend you watch John Wick. Don't rely on the negative reviews some have posted, but make up your own opinion and, like me, I think you will find John Wick to be worthy of praise and seen as, probably, the best action film of 2014."
"billypilgrim23","2","9","21","15 January 2015"," Cliché, boring, seen it before.
","Keanu Reeves is a super-hit-man, who has retired but is forced back for one more job etc etc etc. It sounds familiar because it is exactly like the other countless cliché action movies you have ever seen.<br/><br/>There is exactly nothing original in this movie. He is the best hit-man ever, retires, then his wife dies and some Russian gangster kills his dog so now he has to avenge the dog, killing an entire army of gangsters and eventually the boss. Along the way he gets the help of an old friend in the business who is killed by the boss blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Reeves does his usual thing where he acts exactly the same as in every other Reeves-movie. Seriously, this guy has no range at all.<br/><br/>The boss is the most incompetent gangster-boss in history, has an obnoxious spoiled son who screws everything up etc. <br/><br/>Boring, done a million times, every cliché in the book is used to create a generic, dime a dozen action movie.<br/><br/>Only worth it if you're new here. 3/10"
"sastorytellerfilms","10","9","21","14 January 2015"," Resets the Standard for Action Films
","Keanu Reeves is back and better than ever in this smart revenge movie. Unlike most of the reviews and over analysis, we all really need to remember the point of an action movie. The point is the word action. If it was anything else or more than exciting all the way through it would be drama or suspense. John Wick is the ultimate stop to find fearless and badass. Reeves gives us an action hero that surpasses most typical A or B action films. Astounding gun play and choreography, John Wick falls nothing short of amazing and fantastic. Great cinematography and directing. This movie along with Taken sets a standard for any other action movie in the future. Go see it if you love action and fun revenge films."
"RIK-22","8","10","24","16 January 2015"," Best action movie since Raid 2 and about 10 years before that.
","Of course the plot is nothing new, it's your usual revenge story. However the delivery of this well-trodden path is told in such a quirky, interesting and stylish manner, it makes all the difference.<br/><br/>First off, the camera work and fights scene are superb. Please any director making Bourne, James Bond or the awful Inception, keep the bloody camera on and at a distance. This stupid jumping, cutting every 2 nanoseconds with a camera 5 centimeters from the nose of the actor, is awful. It ruins any action movie.<br/><br/>We know the story is cliché, so the director presents the story in a very chic and interesting way, which doesn't leave you bored. There is also this tongue-in-cheek criminal world with its own rules and quirks, which adds to the interest.<br/><br/>I notice from other reviews there is a lot of focus on the revenue story, being boring and routine. There are almost no original plots these days, most stories are based around a simple plot of love or revenge. This is no different, but what elevates it above so many other actions films is the style, pacing and brilliant fighting scenes. It doesn't dwell on the obvious, it treats the viewer with some intelligence.<br/><br/>There is very little unnecessary obvious join-the-dots dialog. Everything is keep lean, fast and minimal. It doesn't hide the inevitable story, it embraces and celebrates it.<br/><br/>Before someone accuses me of being someone with no film experience, I am in my 40's and have seen way too many movies, I find nearly everything predictable and dull. This one was a very pleasant surprise in a sea of mediocrity."
"JohnRayPeterson","8","10","24","15 January 2015"," A new action character to follow
","In his directorial debut (sort of- it's a collaborative effort) Chad Stahelski shows his skills. He had the experience for just this sort of action movie and delivered the goods.<br/><br/>The script contained just the right amount of background play to set in motion the Taken, Rambo style 'you picked the wrong guy to f@ck with' adventure. Wick is a retired legendary hit man whose love for a good woman had rescued him from the dark side, that is until the dumb- ass son of a Russian mobster robbed his car and killed the only reminder of Wick's cherished wife.<br/><br/>After 47 Ronin, I was eager to see Keanu in this type of adventure. Now admittedly the cast of this movie with the likes of Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Adrianne Palicki, John Leguizamo and Ian McShane gives it panache if I may say so.<br/><br/>The only lovable character was the puppy, a gift from his late wife, received the day of the funeral. As another IMDb reviewer said, if someone killed my puppy under such circumstances... I'd go Boogeyman too; but who has skills like Wick.<br/><br/>There is much collateral damage in this movie and the body-count is in the neighbourhood of 80 (78 according to one source and 84, another).<br/><br/>On the downside, I thought Wick's resilience to gunshot wounds and knife injuries (one self inflicted, but that's complicated to explain) was a bit of a stretch.<br/><br/>Saw several good action movies in 2014 and this late October one was entertaining, if of course you like the genre; I like most all genres.<br/><br/>On a final note: Avoid hotels by the name of 'Continental'!"

There could seriously be a spin off TV series set at the Continental Hotel, the most intriguing and provocative character in the movie. The entire time I watched this film I kept thinking to myself...""I LOVE THIS HOTEL!"" Russian mobsters and gangsters and bathhouses. Tons of hand to hand and basic bad assery set in an underground world where everyone is on the same page and keeps the status quo maintained flawlessly. Filmed and stylized in comic book modus operandi. A total freaking blast and just a good way to blow off steam. I smell cult classic! And Keanu...what a freaking phenomenal action star."
"mitodruroy","8","10","24","15 November 2014"," Keanu Reeves has starred in a good movie after a long time
","Keanu Reeves is back in form as "" John Wick "" and how. Keanu must have been waiting for a long time to play a role like this. Both John Wick's wife and the dog she had gifted him, get killed and he sets out to avenge their deaths. The movie is approximately an hour and a half long and comprises of some insane action sequences coupled with some amazing background music. And Keanu justifies playing a role like this all the more because his name is synonymous with "" The Matrix Trilogy"" and ""Speed"". Ever since the Matrix movies released I've always wanted Keanu to play meaningful action-oriented roles. Unfortunately he hadn't managed to bag such roles until he signed for this movie.<br/><br/>Keanu's looks in this movie have been planned in accordance with the nature of his character and the trying times his character is shown to be going through.<br/><br/>Also, another plus point of this movie is that the villains look menacing. In an 'out-an-out' action thriller like this, it's imperative that the villains look their parts and each and every one of them have played their parts to perfection. Willem Dafoe does a fantastic job as Marcus.<br/><br/>So Keanu Reeves has been a part of a good movie after a long hiatus. Whch is why people should go to the nearest theater and watch this movie as soon as possible."
"ellisalter-555-779511","10","10","24","26 October 2014"," Excellent Adventure
","This is the perfect middle-aged progression of the ass-whipping genre. We've still got it! We can still kick booty! The movie doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, and delivers everything it is supposed to; graphically violent, but hey, its gangsters getting offed, so the heart strings stay intact while the pulse-pounding action ensues. The fight scenes were well executed, unique, so the predictability didn't matter. One does find oneself saying, ""Really? Get another car and dog"". I would have changed the dog explanation, instead of ""it gave me hope"", which didn't make sense, something about it being the last gift from beyond the grave of his beloved wife to remind him of her wishes for his future, thus a personal reminder of walking away from dirt like Ioseph, which would have been a better segue for Viggo's speech. The gas station scene could have made it a little clearer Wick was tenuously hanging onto inexplicable aggressions after losing his wife prematurely, later made clear when we discover the truth of his occupation. Gripping fingers white on the steering wheel? It also needed some explanation why Wick only had a beagle puppy for an alarm system, unlikely for a former hit man. Former, not ex. Ioseph might have explained when Viggo is chastising him for riling the Boogeyman, ""That explains why his security system was so good; we almost didn't get in"". One line. Then show Wick disarming it before the big home invasion. So many intriguing touches like the ""dinner reservations"", the gold coins, the Carlton, and Ian McShane running it. Although I don't think he should have called John ""Jonathan"", totally different name unless they spelled it Jon Wick. Great to see Keanu Reeves in a movie that he was perfect for and in. Totally believable in the roll. Like many attractive men, his looks have evolved into ""distinguished"", and more awesome to watch on the big screen. He has that star charisma that never fades and it's too bad we don't see more of him. Almost no role was a throw-away: John Luguizamo; perfect, Willem Defoe; spot-on, Michael Nyqvist; riveting. Really well cast all of it, although Dean Winters' role seemed strangely superfluous. And, of course, we wanted Wick to get his car back! Maybe when the hotel manager slid car keys across the counter and said it was a gift, Keanu recognizes his Mustang keys, slides them back and says, ""Hang onto that for me, I'll take what I came in"". Definitely buying this when it comes out on DVD."
"The-Sarkologist","9","5","10","19 May 2017"," The Killed His Dog
","All I can say is woah, absolutely brilliant. I never expected a hit man movie to be this awesome. In fact I am surprised that I completely missed this movie and the only reason that I decided to watch it was because the poster for the sequel was just awesome. Okay, maybe one shouldn't judge a movie by its poster, but unfortunately I happen to be one of those people that get completely suckered in by a really cool poster. However after watching this film I'm not really all that convinced that the sequel is going to be anywhere near as awesome as this film I have to admit that I have always been attracted to 'Hitman movies' though as it turns out pretty much every hit-man movie that I have watched has ended up being little more than rubbish. That is until I saw this movie which left me absolutely gobsmacked. Almost every aspect of this movie was brilliant that it pretty much grabbed me right from the beginning and dragged me in right until the end. That is one amazing thing about this film, and that was that it ended really, really well, and even had quite a number of interesting twists in it that left me breathless.<br/><br/>John Wick is a hit-man, though he has since got out of the game. However his wife dies of cancer but her parting gift is a little puppy dog. One day, a couple of days after her funeral, this guy decides he wants his car so he breaks into his house, kills his dog, and steals the car. Well, it turns out to be a really big mistake. Mind you, this kid happens to be the son of the head of the Russian mafia, but that doesn't phase John Wick one bit because he used to work for the Russian mafia, and he was really, really good at what he did. This is why the Russian mafia attempts, and fails abysmally, and getting rid of him first.<br/><br/>One of the really cool things about this film is that within a short space of time it creates this world in which John Wick inhabits, and it is a world where things don't always go according to plan. It is a world of shifting alliances, and friendships that allow people to control their destiny. Even though Wick is the protagonist, he doesn't kill all of the antagonists because this world that has been created actually does a really, really good job of dealing with these problems in a realistic manner. Further, not everybody dies, which also adds to the awesomeness of the film.<br/><br/>This is an action movie, pure and simply. Honestly, I really don't know why anybody would have expected anything along the lines of The Godfather – it was never meant to be as such. It is its own film set in its own world with its own laws. It is a film where you can walk through the streets of New York with a machine gun, and a world where the police, who know who you are, will turn a blind eye to what is in effect a mass murder. In the end it is one awesome wild wide and if you love a good old fashioned action film then you will simply not be disappointed – especially since it comes down to the fact that they killed his dog."

","Yeah, corny title for a review of a very not corny movie. I knew going in that it was going to be a solid frame of gratuitous violent action, and I was not disappointed. I've re-watched this movie a number of times and I love it every single time. <br/><br/>I hate the dog killing scene (as I have dogs of my own) but root for him the entire time he takes his violent vengeance (as is completely justified and should anyone ever harm one of my dogs, they should expect similar response from me ;) ) but it honestly makes the plot so much more. It actually engenders an emotional investment from the audience, as they cheer on John in his quest to avenge his fallen pet.<br/><br/>The best part though, is the fact that Keaneau Reeves actually understands what he is doing and it shows. That little bit of authenticity (there's video of him training for this on YouTube, and he does it every bit as well as the pros do) just takes this movie up and over the edge to awesome!!<br/><br/>There's not a lot to think about here, but when you just want a nice chill evening with no deep thoughts, this movie will definitely work, and it won't put you to sleep."

","Exciting on the edge of your seat enthralled entertainment throughout. The action was very hard hitting and has you jumping with tension. A very unexpected great film, I sat down expecting another typical 'shoot em up' film, but I was very taken in with the first 10 minutes, (the cute beagle story line did help) 'Keanu Reeves' although quietly reserved plays a convincing fearful hit-man assassin! For those of you who love a good 'shoot em up' thrill ride from start to finish, this is the film for you! For the action category i would say this is the best film I've seen this year, still early I know, but this will take some beating, it even beats any action films from 2014 in my opinion. I also thought that the Soundtrack was excellent and worked very well with the action scenes it almost felt like I was playing a First person shoot em up; with my headphones on. The film style had a 'Luc besson' feel to it, in particular 'kiss of the Dragon', and had a touch of 'Taken' Chad Stahelski, David Leitch is a new director to me however i will be keeping an eye on his next work! 9/10 very impressed! <br/><br/>JKemp"

","The whole movie is so condensed, no non-sense. You couldn't see the long-winded plot. Just intense action, serious gun-fight and head splattering shots painted in mosaic. Keanu Reeves had definitely paid a large amount of time in training with the use of CQC(closed quarter combat) and IPSC shooting. With that much of training in his hand, all the action scenes became so realistic, it made you believe that Keanu Reeves was the retired killer, always finish killing with headshot, smallest movement to achieve the goal. The discreet and precision of john wick reminded me of the video game : metal gear solid. If it would going to produce a movie edition. Keanu Reeves should definitely earn a place in casting. It was a good fast-paced and action movie."
"Rendanlovell","7","10","25","4 November 2014"," Glad to have you back Keanu.
","John Wick follows Keanu Reeves a retired hit man who's wife pasted away. He receives a dog as a final gift from her. On his second day with the dog he encounters thugs who want his car. He tells them no and wakes up later that night only to be beaten senseless, his dog killed and his car stolen. And he wants revenge.<br/><br/>Everyone knows that Keanu Reeves doesn't have the best acting range. But when a roll is prefect for him he shines. And this is exactly what happens in John Wick. The film tiptoes the fine line between being ridiculous and over the top. As much killing as Keanu does is basically to get revenge for his dog. Which is borderline stupid but Reeves really sells it. Totally investing in his character and motives. Another notable actor here is William Defoe. While I thought his character was underused he wasn't underwritten and that was a nice little thing.<br/><br/>The world that this film creates is intriguing and brutal. As reeves travels through the criminal underworld various phrases and items are used that are totally foreign even though this is set in New York City. Characters presumably know what they mean and don't bother explaining them to you. This is for the best. Being in the dark on the little things that make the world what it is, is gripping. It makes the world feel like it's been inhabited for a long time and that sets the film apart from the majority of action flicks. As lush as the world is, shoddy camera work struggles at bringing it to life on screen. The focus seemed to be forgotten in a large number of shots. Some shots don't even seem to be focused. The action scenes look great and are void of the annoying blur but in between these tense action sequences the camera work seems amateur at best. Maybe it was just the Theater I was In I don't know. Another problem for the movie was it's ending. Well I'd go as far as to say the entire 3rd act. *SPOILERS* Not much of a spoiler as we all knew Reeves would have his revenge. But after he takes his vengeance the movie limps on for at least another half hour. Attempting to tie up loose ends was a bad call here. It feels like the film climax and then says oh crap we forgot about him! And tries to deal with that and it goes through this 3 or 4 times. This is silly to say with an hour forty minute run time but the last half hour just feel unnecessary and overlong.<br/><br/>Overall John Wick delivers on super cool action, a surprising level of emotional, and a world that feels real. John wick is a fine piece of cinema."
"nick-sultana","9","10","25","2 November 2014"," Revenge gets wicked, bad-ass and returns in top form
","Revenge driven films have always been a top notch example of action and/or horror films, consisting of a storyline where a main character undergoes a dramatic, traumatic and yet sometimes violent ordeal against a person or a group of attackers that leave the victim left for dead and loss of a loved one, only to have survived and is now driven for justice and set on taking down the attackers with vengeance. John Wick is one of those films and not only has that formula but it does give it a fresh take with a well-written script, polished performances and well staged action sequences.<br/><br/>Directed by stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski (alongside David Leitch) in their first directed feature film, they both know how to handle an action flick in terms of direction, pace, realism and quality. They indeed use the best out of the well written script from Derek Kolstad, who ensures that not only is the action present and moving the story along but the character development and pace are taken seriously for the audience to follow and connect. Story goes that John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves, who is indeed back in top form not since Constantine) is a retired hit-man who is grief of his recently deceased wife and is coping with the gift of a dog from her to help John with the pain and loneliness. Whist out for a drive in his 69' Mustang, he comes across Losef (played by Alfie Allen from TV's Game of Thrones) and his mates who offer to buy his precious ride but John declines and sets off his way. But soon after, Losef and co invade his home and brutally beat him, kill his dog and steal his ride. Having survived, John sets out on vengeance on Losef, but when he discovers his background history to his past employer (Michael Nyqvist in bad guy form again), the war between two sides erupts into revenge that only one will live.<br/><br/>The action sequences as mentioned are in top polished presentation, consisting of fast kinetic fist fights and shootouts. The use of practical stunt work is in favor rather than use CGI for the impossible and the results from its director are clear from experience. One of the best sequences of the film is the club house, where John attempts to kill Losef and his protectors by single handily taking them on one-by-one. The character of John in particular is ruthless and deadly throughout the film and Reeves pulls this off with ease, it looks like a mix of the latest James Bond (Daniel Craig), a dash of Jason Bourne from the Bourne films and Bryan Mills from Taken all rolled into the one character. But there is emotion with him, as you see in the first half hour of his fall from peace and again it lacks with most revenge driven films.<br/><br/>The villain is the opposite but the cunningness, determination and will to stop John is indeed there, and the magic of Nyqvist brings this to the screen (he was the main villain in Mission Impossible 4, but he is much used better in this film). The supporting cast includes the talents of William Dafoe, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Adrianne Palicki and Dean Winters to name a few and they all do give the film justice.<br/><br/>John Wick is a surprising return to the 'Revenge' genre and it has indeed suppressed what The Expendables 3 should have been (not to say that it bad) but in terms of story, action, character and presentation it's indeed worth the ticket price to see it and I highly recommend it for action fans of Taken, Faster and Dead Man Down."

Screenplay is fluent, storytelling fashion was on point. john wick is willing to do what he has to, to get what he wants.John Wick is a violent dance of bullet and blood that reflects all the years of experience of it's director as a stunt man and stunt coordinator. The gun battles are what's really good. But I give John Wick a 10 out of 10 its a pretty good movie and I recommend anyone to go see it."
"BeneCumb","8","9","22","22 January 2015"," Stylish (over-)sophistication
","I have always regarded Keanu Reeves a great actor, but some of his choices/opportunities have been bizarre - mildly speaking. Fortunately, John Wick puts Reeves back on track again - he is the real ""filler"" in this movie, there are a few short scenes without his presence, and quite often he is the only personality visible on screen. True, one can find similarities with his character in e.g. Matrix and A Scanner Darkly, and the plot has several flaws and airy-fairy moments, but all this is presented in a stylish and witty manner, with both multiple angles and endings. Reeves/Wick is a gloomy and firm man, his deeds are certain and final, yet dog- and wife-related scenes are nice and touching. And the locality of Hotel Continental is unconventional.<br/><br/>Apart from Reeves, there are many other distinctive performances as well, practically all who have verbal roles. Michael Nyqvist (as Viggo Tarasov) is a due antagonist to Reeves; rather frequently, there is no proper confrontation because the ""bad guy"" is more versatile/fascinating than the ""good guy"" (or vice versa).<br/><br/>All in all, the movie in question is no Tarantino, but yet a good entertaining action with pleasant performances."

","Keanu Reeves is back, HELL YEAH!!<br/><br/>John Wick is a movie about, well, John Wick, a normal guy whose wife recently died and her dying gift to him was a dog. Theon the d**k less a**hole from Game of thrones was being his usual d**k self in this movie and decides to kill John wick's dog and steal his sweet ass mustang. Little did he know that John wick wasn't just some normal guy. And we get our revenge action movie. You don't kill someone's dog and steal their ride, you just don't. <br/><br/>While many people might find the plot stupid or something, let me tell you, there is a lot more to it than a simple revenge tale. The movie knows what it is and executes it perfectly. But underneath all that revenge, there is some really cool world building going on. There are these rules, managements, neutral zones etc, which push John Wick from being just a simple brainless revenge movie. I hope they make sequels to it as there is A LOT of potential for this become an awesome franchise. <br/><br/>Coming back to Keanu Reeves, HOLY S***, he was awesome in this movie. Being a Keanu Reeves fan, it is so great to see him finally get a role where he can shine again. The dude kills it as John Wick. He is cool, he is sleek and he is a total Bada**. Hell, he might give Liam Neeson and Matt Damon a run for their money. :p You appreciate him even more knowing that he did 90% of the stunts in this movie. Because of that, the action scenes consisted of long takes instead of the usual quick cuts we see in Hollywood movies and made the action SO MUCH BETTER. Couple that with good cinematography, slick and sleek directing and pumping soundtrack, and you get yourself an awesome RARE action movie. <br/><br/>Another thing this movie did well was that even though John Wick is shown to be one of the best or THE BEST in his work, he is not invincible or immortal, at the end, he is a human. Many similar movies forget this point and make their heroes way TOO good that it takes you out of the experience. <br/><br/>I really really hope this movie does well enough on the box office that we get a sequel from the same team. Highly recommended if you are looking for an action movie or are a Keanu Reeves fan. <br/><br/>8.5/10"

","I saw this movie with my son early last December. I'm not a Keanu Reeves fanatic, I just like very good movies and he starred in this on. So my son recommended we see it and I agreed, but I did not know what to expect. I do know Keanu has made the best movies of his career, when he moved away from Hollywood main production companies. This film, I think, brought it all! It is about a man, not a good man. A man with quite an evil past, and has put that past behind him. So now it is just him and his Dog. Then it begins, I mean really begins. It opens into some of the best action scenes I have seen in years and they are not flash filler, they really work! This movie moves you from sorrow to anger to wanting revenge! Such a great movie, I had to buy it for my personal collection. So I recommend at least renting it. There is graphic violence because of the nature and lifestyle career of the characters, so no young people recommended!"

","The directorial debut of Chad Stahelski, former stuntman of Keanu Reeves, is everything a fan of the genre, for a long time, has been expecting. With a beautiful choreographed violence, with very well made clichés and presenting a small new world of empathic criminals, creditors of dangerous deadly skills, John Wick is the name that everyone should know. <br/><br/>Called to be the best action film of 2014, John Wick is a violent dance of bullet and blood that reflects all the years of experience of it's director as a stunt man and stunt coordinator. Each armed combat we have the opportunity to enjoy is wonderfully imagined, well polished and sublimely executed by a Reeves, that finally, is back, and apparently with a name that could have the title of legend. Filling the 101 minutes of pleasant clichés, Derek Kolstad delivers a script with a new and unique underworld, made out of rules that must be obeyed and a moral code that can be broken if the price is right. With a simple plot, good humor and a Keanu Reeves back to his days of anti-hero chosen by chance, John Wick is a possible franchise that should continue with its beautifully made clichés, that should exaggerate their camera movements and that should fill with cameos every table of that little new world. <br/><br/>John Wick: 8/10."

","This movie doesn't take itself seriously and that is exactly how a viewer should approach it. Keanu Reeves can act no matter what some people say. I can't picture any other actor in this role, that's how good he is. My only complaint is there aren't enough explosions. The plot is silly but that's the point. It almost seems as if Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it. One gets that Tarantino vibe while watching. It's a perfect action movie with a few laughs thrown in between. John Wick is one bad-ass dude that you don't want to cross and he doesn't leave things unresolved. Eat popcorn, shut down your brain and you'll have a great time."

","Wow. I really loved this movie. The action was well shot, the acting was spot on for this kind of movie and the nonchalant humor was simply brilliant and pushed this movie beyond my expectations. I might be over overpraising this film, but in the last few years action films have been horrible. This is mostly due to those terrible Liam Neeson disposable action movies. John Wick on the other hand felt like an old school action film with a wry self awareness that worked without parodying action films. <br/><br/>While Keanu Reeves often gets labeled as a bad actor, I've always enjoyed seeing him on screen. I think this is because he has a natural warmth and likability that arguably transcends his talents. They actually play on it in John Wick, for example he kills a lot of people in this film and yet everyone still likes John Wick, even the cops turn the other cheek because he is just so damn likable. I think that also goes for the film as whole, its the kind of film that we probably shouldn't like but we can't help ourselves. <br/><br/>I think this one might even be remembered as an action classic in a few years.

","I was really in-between 7 and 8, as a score for the movie. To be honest, this is a relative rating for me. I have rated better movies with less, but this movie, in relation to others of the genre is simply awesome! <br/><br/>To attempt to break down the logic of the movie a bit... The reasons why Keanu goes after this pathetic excuse of a son are not logical. Any reasonable person would expect him to accept the mobster's offer and get the car back and a new dog. Well, guess what! If he had done what was reasonable, we would not have a movie in the end! What happens after that is actually against all logic and it's what I love about the movie. He goes into impossible situations, just to survive and some more! In my mind, he could be a Tarantino character this guy. I assume that no one would complain then. <br/><br/>Overall, his character, the situations and the discussions in the movie, seem to me like reading a comic or graphic novel of some kind. His face, his way of moving, everything, generated still images of a comic book in my mind. This is what I loved about the movie and this special flavor in the end made me love it. It was watching a movie and reading a good graphic novel all in one. <br/><br/>The acting from the father-crime lord is from my point of view, exemplary for any type of movie and of course I loved the addition as the receptionist of the guy from Fringe TV Series (I am really bad with names!). The ending is satisfactory for me although I would have liked more (a) a slower death for the son and (b) a quicker death for the mobster father, since he gave him all this crap in the movie. <br/><br/>Overall a nice way to spend your evening if you are not up for a really mind-puzzling movie. Keanu Reeves was really good for the first time after quite some movies."

","John Wick is easily Keanu''s best film since the original (and only good film in the franchise) matrix. The action slowly builds along with the tension as Wick seeks revenge for the murder of his dog and the theft of his beloved car (great scene in the garage when the thieves turn up with Wicks' stolen car and Leguizamo realises who's car it is and what is coming next). The bad guys get no sympathy as carnage ensues and Reeves is great as the relentlessly cold killer. This film is the taken sequel that has never happened! Nyqvist gets to play a heartless bad guy and mafioso style boss who's son is the primary goal of Wick's revenge. I disagree with those who say there is no story to this film (some of the same people liked speed which is, and always has been, simply awful!) and I think the characters are reasonably well thought out and the acting good for a film of this genre.

","In today's day it is as hard to make a good action movie as it is to break box office records. Thrillers may be based on tried and tested formulate, but that is the reason why to bring something new and refreshing becomes harder and harder in this genre. 'John Wick' is a tale of revenge, a man with a violent past who is brought back to the life he left behind when he is brutally attacked and his dog is killed. The plot works because it doesn't try anything new, in fact it takes you back several decades to Lee Marvin in 'Point Blank'. Keanu Reeves's character of 'John Wick' is a throwback to Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson and every other bad ass who doesn't bother to say much but shoots instead. This in itself is refreshing, just a simple action thriller with no over-complicated storyline and ingenious twist. This movie is quite different to the other great tale of revenge released at the same time; 'The Equalizer', mainly because Keanu Reeves is a much different actor to Denzel Washington. John Wick is for the lovers of hard action and no frills!"

Now, if you traded the wife for a car and the children for a car, you would be spot on.<br/><br/>It did seem a bit silly that all of this was over a, and I quote, ""f**king dog*. So much so that every time someone said ""f**king dog"" I found it funny.<br/><br/>All of that aside, this movie is action packed almost from the start to the very end. Aspects of it were silly and unbelievable but that's in keeping with the nature of this genre of movie. I mean Mr Wick is shot, stabbed with a broken bottle, punched and beaten and survives pretty much unharmed, managing to get to a Dr at the Hit-man Hotel (aka the Continental) - but when he purposely stabs himself at the end, he almost kills himself in the process.<br/><br/>In spite of all of that, I actually really enjoyed it even if it was a bit silly. Today's action movies almost seem to be far too constructed and effects ridden, this is good old dirty beat em up action - simplistic it may be, but thoroughly enjoyable still."

","That basically was the primary thought echoing through my mind during the end credits. Seriously... EVERYBODY has to be so damn tough... EVERYBODY has to revenge bloody EVERYTHING... I'm talking about the bad guys here... Not to give anything away, but they REALLY set you up fully to expect and enjoy the revenge that has truly been earned by these fools.<br/><br/>Sorry to go off like that, but although necessary and ultimately entertaining, it is still SO bloody frustrating from a strictly intellectual point of view, that these stubborn Evil @ssholes Never EVER know when to quit! GEEZ... Well, clearly giving it a rating of '8', I really did like the film. Most entertaining. VERY reminiscent of the minimalist Clint Eastwood 'Man with No Name' films. But, brought up to date.<br/><br/>The story is simple and with so many reviews, there is no need to go into it more here; but watching the film I got the strong impression almost like I was watching a video game. And, I mean that in a good way. The action was SO smooth and choreographed. This is STRICTLY Revenge / Action entertainment people; and VERY good entertainment at that if you enjoy revenge tales. But, don't expect Mamet or Shakespeare here; that is just not the point of this film.<br/><br/>That's basically it; I don't know why I am writing a review when there are nearly 500 already (normally I don't) but, since I had such a frigg'n BLAST watching this, I just wanted to weigh in as saying that it is LOTS of fun and very well done. Keanu is absolutely perfect for it, despite your opinion of him. If you like a good, Action / Revenge Thriller, then you probably will really enjoy this. It's not overly deep or over the top violence wise. It just does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it beautifully..."

","This is an incredible action film. I was surprised by how enjoyable it is. It has heart wrenching moments, amazing fighting, great music, incredible cinematography and editing, spectacular acting, and among most cliche action movies, this was the most realistic. Also, the element of an ""assassin society"" is incredibly interesting and makes the film not only more meaningful, but makes the sequels more meaningful too. If it was a trilogy of the same revenge story with new villains, it would get boring. However, with the addition of an overarching element, things are more interesting.
Also, the film scores extra points for Willem Dafoe, David Patrick Kelly, and music by Marilyn Manson."

","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) the other super crime fighter from New Jersey, the one without a mop, retired from being a hitman for the Russian mafia. When the undisciplined son (Alfie Allen) of the mafia steals John Wick's car and kills his puppy, this sets off Wick for some over-the-top revenge that includes the entire Russian mafia in New Jersey.<br/><br/>The film is action driven with moments of humor and dark humor, some unintentional. For instance, the mere mention of Wick's name makes men tremble, reminding me of the South Park Keanu Reeves running gag. Personally I would have loved it if they just left the name at Keanu Reeves. Yes, he once killed three men at a bar with a pencil, again a running story/gag in hitman films. John Wick is not the boogie man but ""the man you hire to kill the boogie man.""<br/><br/>There were some ""safe zones"" in New Jersey, places where mafia people can't kill each other. This was a bit weird and awkward as was the soundtrack during the first major fight which was like listening to someone trying to play metal grindhouse with drums which stutter start and stop. It worked better in subsequent scenes, but not the first one. It was also odd that someone could get the drop on John which started this whole thing off, and that John would sleep with his curtains open, after all he did kill three men with a pencil. Imagine if he had a ballpoint.<br/><br/>For those who like over-the-top action films with the improbable and impossible, plus some humor, this is it.<br/><br/>F-bomb. No sex or nudity."

","The reason this review is like 5 years late is because my friend recently suggested we go see the the third instalment of the series, as the first two are so epic. I was like really?? He was like, yeah, oh my god, you gotta see John Wick! So now I have seen John Wick...<br/><br/>Ok, the film starts off quite well. Immediately you sense a high standard in terms of production. Slick camera work, innovative editing, stunning lighting. Also the plot starts okay, we are introduced to John, seemingly normal decent guy, living a normal life with his puppy, mourning the loss of his recently deceased wife. Whilst minding his own business on a road trip, a few 'Russian' thugs like the look of his car and try to buy it off him. He rejects the offer, and drives away. Russian thugs really want this car, so they presumably follow him to his home. They then confront poor John in the middle of the night. Beat the crap out of him, and inexplicably kill his pet puppy in the process. Note that in this scene John comes across as quite vulnerable and practically defenceless against these thugs. If the thugs had of wanted to kill him, they really could have done. Instead they knock him out and leave with his car. John is left broken, and utterly distraught that his adored puppy has been taken from him. He wants revenge, and at this point we all want him to get revenge! But how is he going to go about? This man is no fighter, he can't physically take these thugs on, we've seen that all ready. He's gonna have to devise a plan, and he's gonna have to be brave. This could be good, my friend was right. WRONG..<br/><br/>It turns out that John Wick is a super killer assassin. An invincible, unstoppable killing machine. They messed with the wrong guy! It also turns out that the rest of this film is steaming pile of cow pat...<br/><br/>Queue John Wick killing hundreds and hundreds of practically innocent men in pursuit of his revenge. Okay I think amongst it all he does get the three original thugs, but you could miss it, seeing as he kills so many. And that is it, thats all this film is. Yes it's slick, hence not giving it 1 star, but it is shockingly immature.<br/><br/>One last gripe, (equally as stupid as the fact that at the start of the film JW had his 'Steven Seagal' mode switched off), is how films think its only cool for 'heroes' to kill men. At one point in this dribble, a female assassin is going all out to kill John, as he has a two million $ bounty on his head. This woman, a professional assassin, and very dangerous will stop at nothing until John is dead, it is likely that she has killed many before. In a fight, John over powers her, and decides not to finish her off as she is a woman, despite the fact that she is only going to come back and try and kill him again. In contrast John kills many men that he really does not have too. Most not even posing a threat and had nothing to do with the killing of his puppy. In fact this female assassin goes on to kill one of John friends! But oh no, he can't kill a woman, thats not cool right??<br/><br/>Wow. Not a big shock but I won't be watching the sequel or the third instalment. My friend and many others seem to lap up this garbage..."

"andrewtiu-27196","10","3","5","5 October 2018"," John Wick: The New Standard For Action Movies Today
","First of all, I just have to say that, a lot of the action movies I've watched are filled with cliche, sometimes unrealistic and over the top and especially predictable in life-or-death scenarios, but John Wick is different in my opinion. And that's why I liked this film. Plot-wise, there isn't really much, after all, it's just John Wick going after and taking revenge on people who have disturbed his peaceful life by stealing his car and killing the dog his late wife gave to him. The real gemstone, shine, and luster of this film is none other than the cinematography. The action scenes were all very well shot. They bring a sense of awe and surprise at its execution and deliverance. Everything is all stable (no shaky cam this time, yay!), fluid, paced well with no dragged out elements, and they did it in such a way that still lets you understand what is going on. You don't need to wonder to yourself what is happening. It isn't like a lot of action movies these days that use shaky cam a lot, dragged out, and shot with lots of cuts, to the point you don't understand what's happening and gets boring really quick. Moreover, everything is still kept realistic, as the action never forgets reloading and proper stance, as well as attention to detail from everything I've gathered. Here it is, y'all, the movie that has very well-shot action scenes that you don't need to wonder to yourself what is going on. So sit back and enjoy the fun!<br/><br/> I have mentioned earlier in this review that a lot of action movies I watched are filled with a lot of cliche, and sometimes very over the top, predictable, and unrealistic when it comes to life and death situations. Seriously, I've seen this happen a lot. I'm no stranger to it. So you may be wondering, how exactly did John Wick defy our expectations (even mine) of an action movie, especially given these regular aforementioned flaws that we regularly see in action movies? Well, first and foremost, one common thing I noticed with action movies then again is how they may come off as unrealistic and over the top, especially when it comes to predictability. However, John Wick is different from this as stated earlier. He is not an unkillable person like we always think with main characters in action movies. Take Fast and Furious 8 for example. That movie may have been a fun watch for me, but it came off to me as too over the top, and sometime through I realized they weren't gonna die and that something would happen that would save them in the end, in some unrealistic way. John Wick in contrast gets hit and beaten up many times, and even gets captured and even almost killed at times. It is with this that you start to believe in the stakes of this film, that in his quest, you actually worry about him and think, ""He's been through a beating a lot, I wonder how this is gonna play out."" You also may be thinking at this point, how exactly? He seems to kill tons with ease, so doesn't that make it a tad bit over the top like you said? Well, let me tell you this. If you remember the one scene where Viggo Tarasov chastises his naive, arrogant, and bratty son Iosef for starting a war with Wick, it is stated that he is a former hitman who used to work for the Russian Mafia, notable for clearing many missions deemed difficult for the average hitman, even one that Viggo acknowledged as being impossible before John Wick parted ways with them, thus earning the nickname ""The Boogeyman"". This manages to shed a different light on this argument as Wick is presented as being an expert in his field, who, with the level of skill he has, presents himself as a literal one-man army, that can take down people with ease. That adds a logical foundation to how he does what he does. He is presented with a BACKGROUND, instead of something illogical that many would deem hard to believe. <br/><br/> To end, if you want to see an action movie that will undoubtedly defy your expectations, John Wick is a must-see. It wastes no time getting down to business, does not drag things out to the point it gets boring, has extremely well-done action scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat with palms sweating, and to top it all off, has a very intense tone and atmosphere all throughout that makes you feel every single thing this movie has to offer. You absolutely cannot miss out on this. If you haven't seen it yet, go and see it now! I promise you will not be disappointed."

","Not since The Transporter had I seen an action movie containing ALL the clichés of the genre. But while The Transporter laughs at them, the action scenes are both fun and great, and each new cliché introduced only serves to reinforce the joke, John Wick transports you to this state of mind where you're already guessing what's going to happen afterwards but you are hoping that it really really does not, mixed with a fascination at realizing that yes, it actually happens. I cannot understand how it can anything like the scores it has. The script is terribly bad. Action scenes are _mostly_ OK, but inconsistencies in the story and bad lines ruin them."
"mounirrmaged","8","3","5","14 August 2017"," A fresh take on action movies that's simplistic and badass
","John Wick is the directorial debut of film maker Chad Stahelski, and features a triumphant return for Keanu Reeves as John Wick. The plot is a simple revenge story, but by no means generic. John Wick is a retired hit-man, who misses his wife. One day, he receives a dog as a gift. But all goes downhill when a Russian gang steal his car and kill his dog. It turns then into a cat and mouse chase. <br/><br/>So as described, the film isn't exactly super complex, or emotionally driven (though it does give us enough to sympathize with the main character, and give us also enough to be invested), but it is obvious from the very start that film doesn't try to be so. It instead gives you well choreographed action sequences.<br/><br/>Surprisingly though, John Wick is a compelling character to get behind, thanks to a tight script and a passionate performance by Keanu Reeves. the film could have benefited had the musical score been added, adding more subtlety and nuance, for example, when he receives the dog and reads the letter, the scene could have been more powerful without the voice over and the music. <br/><br/>Now let's talk about the action. This has to be one of the best directed action set pieces in the genre. The camera work is very graceful and stylistic, allowing us to witness the entire action scenes, knowing when to cut and when to give us the full picture. It's something that's not common in modern action films, and for that, the action is glorious, The key to this is because the camera is focused. There is no stupid shaky camera, or unnecessary cut edits. It just lets the scenes naturally flow. The cinematography is also brilliant and visually gorgeous, giving a scene of hostile and loneliness, as well as a violent, dead environment. It is easily the best aspect of the film, and the reason why John Wick is such a good movie. Overall, the film is fantastic and i would recommend it to any action movie fan."

","I had several friends tell me this was a great movie so I went into it with above average expectations. Sadly I was disappointed. I enjoy movies where the main characters are bigger than life, but this was just one big disappointment for me. There was no brains to the movie. The main character's mode of operation didn't have the slightest hint of realism. The fight scenes were well choreographed, but highly improbable and quite cliché. If you want action movies with a brain I highly recommend The Professional (Leon), Bourne Identity, or The Usual Suspects. If you want an action movie with a better story and more entertainment watch The Boondock Saints. If you're just looking for a highly stylized action movie, here is some basic entertainment for you."

Other than that I say that GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE!!! movie starts like this..... The movie's setup is almost comical in its simplicity. Reeves plays the hero of the title, a legendarily immortal (almost Keyser Söze-like) hit-man who retired from the profession five years earlier when he fell in love. But his wife has just passed away, and some hot- headed Russian gangster (Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen) has foolishly interrupted his grieving by stealing his 1969 Ford Mustang, beating the snot out of him, and killing his dog. And you just don't mess with a man's dog. John Wick is back in business. Decked out in a natty black three-piece suit and a scruffy beard, Wick is a classic man of few words. He's Clint Eastwood minus the cheroot and the spaghetti. I'd be surprised if he speaks more than a dozen lines in the film. But when he opens his mouth, you can be damn sure he means what he says. His is the language of high-caliber bursts of lead and acrobatic fists-of-fury beat-downs."

Music selection also made various scenes more enjoyable. Just a well groomed picture with a load energy and smart dialog. You will not be disappointed. I think one of the most enjoyable scenes was just a phone conservation between a mafia boss and one of his employees. The boss asked his employee why he struck his son. The employee responses because your son stold John Wick's car and killed his dog. The silence and the the response of oh and the look on the mafia boss's face let you know the carnage that was about to take place."
"Al_The_Strange","8","9","23","30 November 2014"," John Wick Review
","If it's one thing action movies can teach us, it's that you don't mess with people who have nothing left to lose. John Wick hinges on the simple premise of a retired hit-man who plows through the Russian mafia and leaves a mile-long body trail, all because they killed his puppy. And stole his ride. Somebody has to pay! As silly this may sound, the film plays it all with a straight face, and it works because there is a good amount of heart to the setup. In the opening scenes, we see that this is more than the story of a man, his car, and his dog; it's the story of a loss and betrayal. Once the appropriate pathos is established, John Wick rises as the tough and skilled action hero we can root for. It doesn't take long for the butt-kicking to commence, but once it does, it's densely-packed, fast-paced, relentlessly-brutal, and very well-executed. Whether shooting, punching, stabbing, or running bad guys over, it is quite a rush to watch Wick descend into the criminal underworld and find payback.<br/><br/>As exciting and stylish as the film is, what really keeps it from falling into mediocrity is the title character. The film successfully evokes sympathy for Wick - the man who lost his wife, before losing everything else - and it provides a solid reasoning for why we should care about whether or not Wick succeeds. As the film goes on, Wick's journey takes him through a bizarre criminal world with its own set of rules, codes, and even currency. It turns out that it's a world Wick is already familiar with, and he has a history with most of the minor characters that pop up. Thus, the film unearths stark themes of how the past, present, and future are entwined.<br/><br/>This film is well-shot, with great-looking photography and editing. It is especially refreshing that the action scenes are solid and steady, with no fast-cutting or camera shake. I also think the color schemes and nighttime cityscapes lend the film a dark and grimy type of neo-noir appeal. Acting is fine for what it is; you may not think much of Keanu Reeves, but this film is proof that the man can act. His portrayal of John Wick is quite spot-on. And he can kick a lot of butt very impressively. Writing is not the best, but it gets the job done. This production has pretty good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music choices, and the music score, feature really heavy beats and hard rock cues, and I found it awesome that way.<br/><br/>John Wick, much like A Bittersweet Life, is a dark crime movie with lots of action, but also a lot of emotional backing behind its characters. It's a simple story that's told well and features plenty of satisfying setpieces. Recommended for at least one viewing.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)"
"DareDevilKid","8","9","23","21 November 2014"," Keanu Reeves Goes Ballistic in this Bloody, Slick, Stylish, Cool Action Film
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.8/5 stars<br/><br/>""John Wick"" is a rousing action thriller of the sort rarely encountered in theaters these days. The once popular genre, which was headlined by the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger during its heyday, has been a dying breed during the past two decades. Occasionally, a movie like ""The Raid: Redemption"" (or its bigger, better sequel, ""The Raid 2: Berandal"") comes along to satisfy fans with a penchant for R-rated violence, but the growing desire for PG- 13 action and the emergence of computer generated imaging has rendered old-school brutality obsolete. Then along comes unlikely candidate, Keanu Reeves, to ignite the flame once again. For those who crave no-holds barred action, this may be among the best the genre has to offer.<br/><br/>On paper, the film is generic as generic gets: John Wick's (Keanu Reeves) wife dies of an unnamed disease (Bridget Moynahan plays the role, such as it is), and her final act on this world is to arrange for a beagle puppy to be sent to him. This is a beautiful, lifesaving act, and it lasts for two days, until a vile, boorish Russian named Iosef (Alfie Allen) wants to buy Wick's beautiful muscle car, and Wick isn't selling. So Iosef and his thug buddies break into Wick's home, steal his car, beat him bloody, and in a moment of pique, kill the dog. And it is this, which he later describes as the theft of the last hope he had in the whole world, that pushes him into a blood rage. John Wick, you see, is a retired assassin. And Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), the Russian mobster who used to be Wick's employer. And those are all the ingredients we need in a film about revenge, a cool action hero, and all-out-war against the Russian mafia.<br/><br/>There isn't much of a plot, but that's often the case with revenge- based tales. Movies of this sort aren't about narrative depth, they're about taking a hero through an increasingly difficult series of bad guys until he comes face-to-face with the Big Boss. ""John Wick's"" greatest strength is its relentless momentum. The film doesn't have a lot of down time. It offers occasional breaks, including some amusing scenes that take place in a hotel where guests aren't allowed to ""talk business."" (Breaking that rule, it turns out, can have serious consequences.) For the most part, however, ""John Wick"" knows what it is and is unapologetic about it. This is a kick-butt action film with no pretensions of being anything else. There is a short dialogue about karma and God but it's neither deep nor long.<br/><br/>Reeves is in many ways a perfect choice for the lead. When the movie begins, Wick is in a deep funk following the death of his wife. His emotions have been shut down and remain thus for most of the film as he goes about his work. Reeves has never displayed much range; his screen presence has always been his strongest asset and it's in abundant evidence here. Wick is more of a force of nature than a fully realized character. Reeves has sufficient backstory to make him sympathetic but, thankfully, his past is murky. In fact, ""John Wick"" presents the best platform to showcase Reeves' enigmatic screen presence - there are vividly choreographed fights, a suave black suit for the hero, and no greater moral purchase on our rooting interest than that he's Keanu Reeves, and the bad guys killed his dog.<br/><br/>The film was co-directed by former stuntmen/coordinators Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (DGA rules mandate that Stahelski be given sole official credit). They show a good understanding of how to frame a fight and never resort to the kind of rapid-fire cutting that reduces an action scene into visual confetti. The six or seven big action scenes feature a sleek, chic gusto and the shoot-outs are brutal and shot in longish takes rather than chopping them into short frames. The few one-on-one fights are well choreographed, and are neither overtly short nor do they drag on forever. There's a fantastic car chase scene too, and fortunately it doesn't look derivative from erstwhile action films and is constricted within the right time frame. Leitch and Stahelski may not be on the short list to direct the next Jane Austen adaptation. but they know their stuff when it comes to action films, and that's all that matters.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" is the kind of ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of. Reeves, always a nimble action presence, delivers the goods and then some. Chad Stahelski - Keanu's former stunt double - and David Leitch - Brad Pitt's former stunt double - direct with a flair for movement and framing that slams you right into the fights, stabbings, and shoot-outs. From home invasion to a hotel for assassins, the stage is set for all hell to break loose, and that it does. Moral nourishment is not on the menu, but some memorable one-liners are. Juicy supporting performances from Michael Nyqvist and Alfie Allen, and terrific cameos from Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, and Ian McShane are ample compensation in the acting department. The kick of ""Wick"" is not to be denied. It's as close to a pure adrenaline rush as you're likely to find at the moment. What else does an action movie need? Action movies are about movement, and ""John Wick"" pursues that goal with remorseless verve.<br/><br/>The film is also wickedly funny, with a dry wit and upended expectations not only about the character himself but the underground world that sucks hims back in. ""John WicK"" is a carnivorous thriller that wonderfully displays the immeasurable depth of one man's thirst for retribution. Stylish, thrilling, and giddily kinetic, John Wick serves as a satisfying return to action for Keanu Reeves, and what looks like could be the first of an immensely entertaining franchise."

","Most films have been really disappointing for me lately. I've maybe come across 3 or 4 good ones in the last few years...the films of late have just been missing something, don't know how to exactly put it. This film HAS it. I thought to myself...'Oh great, another shoot em up revenge type movie', and it is that but it's all in how the movie is made. Keanu Reeves does a very good job and was a good choice to play the character of John Wick. There is lots of originality to be found in the movie and that is what gives it the ump! This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again without ever getting bored at all. Go see it in the theaters and you will not be disappointed, trust me. This is one of those that is best when seen on the big screen in big sound."
"mitchell5954","9","9","23","29 October 2014"," Modern Action Classic!
","John Wick is easily the best action film since Skyfall. I might even like this more than Skyfall actually. This is better than any of the Expendables films, even Expendables 2. John Wick is a badass revenge flick that knows what it is and goes all-out with it. This film doesn't try to be something it isn't or be overly complicated to try to appease a certain audience. This film is really what the film Machete should've been. Machete was advertised as an awesome revenge film that brought back classic action films, but it really wasn't. It tried to be deep and relevant with constant preaching about the border and it really detracted from what the film initially was supposed to be and it was very boring and quite disappointing. This film knows what it is and it is really refreshing. Keanu Reeves brings his A-game, as does all the side cast. The action is great and well-choreographed. The villain is badass and humorous at the same time.<br/><br/>The story is simple and straight forward. John Wick is a former Hit-man but has been out of the game for five years. The film starts with his wife sadly dying and there is a funeral. Then he finds a dog on his doorstep which was his wife's final gift to him. Shortly after all that these mobsters start screwing with him. One of them is the son of the main villain, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), who John once worked for. Eventually the beat him up and kill his dog, which was a huge mistake. John then snaps and goes on a killing spree to get these guys back.<br/><br/>The character, John Wick, is definitely a badass you don't want to screw with. He doesn't talk much and he doesn't need to. He lets his actions speak for him and he's merciless. He doesn't screw around at all. He reminds be a lot of Liam Neeson in Taken. This film has a very similar feel to Taken. For example, I like how it's basically John Wick verses everybody for the most part. Dafoe helps him out a bit but it's mainly John by himself wasting an army of mobsters just like it was Liam Neeson by himself wiping-out a ton of bad guys with no mercy or hesitation. There is no pointless love-interest, goofy sidekick, or stupid comic relief characters put it. It's just John Wick by himself which is how it should be. However I like this film more than Taken for a couple reasons that I'll get to.<br/><br/>What's particularly cool about Wick is just the amount of build-up and praise he gets by everyone in the film including the main villain. What I like is that all the characters in this film seem to know each other particularly John himself. Everyone in this film respects John Wick and/or fears him which makes all the more badass. This shows that Keanu Reeves is great if given the right role. Many people trash him but I never found him a bad actor.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this film awesome is its side characters. William Dafoe has a smaller role as John's old friend and fellow Hit-man. Dafoe is always awesome in any role he's in. You can put him in a lame Goblin costume straight from the set of Power Rangers and he'll come out awesome. The rest of the cast is equally memorable. The side characters don't get much time but they make the most of what little they have to do and all of them have presence.<br/><br/>The villain, Viggo, is also quite strong. I like that him hand Wick know each other, have worked together before, and that Viggo has a respect for John and is even quite scared of him. The way he describes John in the beginning and his constant uneasiness when he finds out he's back I find quite funny and awesome at the same time. He could've just been a nothing villain that was basically just a punching bag for Wick, but he has some pretty badass moments and has a presence to him. This is the reason I like this film more than Taken. In Taken the side characters weren't very strong and neither were the villains but that is not the case here.<br/><br/>The action is great as I said earlier. The fights are well-choreographed and there is hardly any shaky-cam. It's R-rated so they go all-out and it gets bloody. The film looks great and has an atmosphere to it. The length is just right for the film this is. If it was any longer it would've felt padded-out as some action film of late have.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick is a new modern action classic. It is definitely worth checking-out if you're into action films."

","John Wick is a triumphant return to action cinema for Keanu Reeves. I won't say any more than this or mention the other films in his career but I saw it this morning and had a great time. Reeves is brilliant in this film, which is about an infamous retired hit-man (one-man killing machine) who plunges back into the underworld in the pursuit of revenge. If you've seen the trailer the story is as simple as it appears: a pretext is to give Keanu the opportunity to be entertaining-as-hell as a gun-wielding bone-crunching badass. Luckily the magic works and a cheesy, tongue-in-cheek, actioner becomes a breathless explosion of Russian-hit men and mobsters. Yes, Russians are back on the menu. Why is this entertaining? Because it's Keanu, and he's back. No offense to Arnold but we all know who's cooler. The movie is superficial adrenaline-fueled fun and has the style and skill to keep you involved in the mayhem. Personally, I thought that there was just the right amount of everything. It doesn't avoid cheesiness but it doesn't matter when you're here to have fun. I'd like to make the point that the Russians portrayed in this film are purely fictional representations of mafia-members and I hold a deep respect for the dignity and integrity of the true Russian people."

","I walked out of the theater feeling great. I felt like it was worth the money and time. In fact, it is the best movie of 2014 for me, personally. I had wished for characters in the past to be more FULL of human emotions and act out on those emotions because that is what makes me connect to a character. I want to despise villains, and I got to do that. I wanted to sit through the whole movie without checking the time on my led lit watch. I did. This is a complete movie and doesn't leave much to ponder about the what ifs. The story rolls quite quickly which is great because sometimes I wish I had a remote control to press forward when I watch some movies. All characters are great. The plot is great. The script is amazing. The cinematography, oh my oh my! Also the soundtrack is actually perfect!!! <br/><br/>All reviews are subjective, however, if you think you are a little like me then this movie will leave you entertained! Great flick!<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves must make more movies like this one!!!!!<br/><br/>#JohnWick"

"erwinpeeters","8","8","20","13 January 2015"," Way way over the top... and i love it!!
","Let me start by saying this movie is not for everyone, it has a lot of violence and the story is very thin.<br/><br/>So why do i love it do you say? I grew up with the over the top movies of the 80's like Commando,Rambo and so on. I loved those when i was young, if i watch them now i can't make it further then 10 minutes but John Wick took me back to those times.<br/><br/>In recent years a lot of directors tried to make a movie like this and failed simply because they took themselves too seriously. John Wick just is what it is, a very violent movie without any pretense to being more. The direction is great, the production is great, the acting is good. It takes me back to the movies of my youth.<br/><br/>Of course this is isn't the best movie ever made, Michael Nyqvist shouldn't be in a Hollywood production in my opinion and what i don't like of the modern movies is the very obvious CGI wounds and blood, it is just not good and very distracting.<br/><br/>But i give this movie a solid 8, i really enjoyed it, don't expect too much just relax and watch it"
"tangojazz","10","8","20","30 November 2014"," If Satan ruled the world...the most vicious action movie, ever.
","It's Keanu Reeves greatest movie, ever! I can't believe how many people Keanu (John Wick) killed in this movie! Maybe 80 or more, I lost count. And over a dog! Yes, Keanu as the Anti-Christ, the most evil out of the evil, a destroying hell's angel, a veritable force of nature! Never have I enjoyed cheering on the bad guy (John Wick) so much. And it's also how he did it! Sometimes shooting the 80 or so bad guys each two or three times in the head and chest (John Wick had a lot of ammunition). I have not seen this much raw, explosive action in a long time. ""John Wick"" felt like an amped up version of the Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies like ""Commando"" or ""Raw Deal"" but even more so! This has to be the most nastiest, nihilistic, existentialist, insane, outrageous, ironic, comedic, repellent and vicious action movie ever made! Guns, guns or more guns. It might make you throw up! And unbelievably, it might also make you laugh! There's also some great acting in this movie, by the way, from people like Willem DaFoe and Ian McShane.This also has to be the most Anti- Russian movie America has ever made. Russians left and right are being killed by the bushel full! So go see ""John Wick"" now, if you've got the stomach for it. And treat your pets with kindness, or John Wick will hear about it! Finally, what would John Wick do to Batman?"

"pachl","7","8","20","24 October 2014"," A rebirth for Keanu Reeves as an actor
","Let's be blunt: film snobs, along with many regular movie-going fans, think that Keanu Reeves' acting is, to put it mildly, a bit wooden. For those who thought he was a mediocre actor at best should see John Wick. It's proof Reeves has drastically improved as an actor.<br/><br/>I read a ""professional"" review in which the film critic still lambasted Reeves' ""robotic demeanor"". That is absolute nonsense. I was so intrigued when I saw the trailer for this movie. Immediately it struck me that Keavu Reeves seemed to absolutely own this role. But that was just short outtakes. Could he really be that good in the whole movie?<br/><br/>Easy answer: yes.<br/><br/>John Wick is a revenge thriller. He's emotionally wounded from the untimely death of his wife from some undisclosed illness. The son of a Russian crime boss makes the tragic mistake of attacking John Wick and killing his dog. We have no idea up to this point that John Wick is legendary as a killer. Ruthless and skilled, everyone fears him.<br/><br/>No apology is sufficient for what was done to him so he embarks on a mission to kill the crime boss' son. As always happens in movies of this genre, John Wick is always outnumbered by ten to one, and yet he kills everyone in his path to revenge and keeps moving forward.<br/><br/>Although at the end there was some dopiness to the plot, Keanu Reeves was stellar. He was focused, not wooden. He was dynamic, not robotic.<br/><br/>We've seen a younger Keanu Reeves do comedy. He had some great successes. We saw him in Dracula, and wish we hadn't. We've seen him in near-misses like A Walk In The Clouds, that failed in no way due to him (he was excellent) but in cheap, sappy plot points that tried to bring an emotional closure.<br/><br/>Now we see him clearly back in the game. I would love to see Keanu Reeves do something risky now; maybe take a chance on a comedy. It's clear he is up to it. His reputation as an actor should greatly improve after this rock solid performance."
"crownofsprats","1","7","17","2 March 2017"," Not even Nick Cage could have saved this
","Firstly, I love action! Kung Fu, Gun Fu, car chases, swordfighting, sieges and battles, wholesale destruction of cities and planets - bring it! And it doesn't have to be artsy, brainy, historically accurate, or close to the source material. It just has to keep me entertained from start to finish. <br/><br/>In the entire running time of John Wick, there was only about twenty seconds of anything resembling entertainment. Keanu shoots up a (fake) Orthodox church in one scene. At another point, Dafoe is trying to unscrew his silencer and has to lick his fingers because it's hot. That, I thought, was the best scene in the film.<br/><br/>The rest is an unimaginative, humorless slog through clichés and tropes that got worn out almost two decades ago. A bunch of high- priced assassins dressed like professional card and yo-yo illusionists from Vegas? (The assassins are supposed to abide by a thing - it's like rules, or a code, or...what's that word? Oh yeah - creed.) Flashy cars going really fast, making sharp turns, and getting smashed up? (Whatever happened to car explosions, cheapskates?) Sleazy-suited euro-trash gangsters from some unspecified eastern European country? (Are these guys supposed to be Russian or something? Because they were terrible at it.) A trashy, throbbing nightclub where they party at? Yep, all there - presented like we're supposed to know all about this kind of stuff but still be all excited and into it like it's the first time we've seen it. The worst of both worlds! The dialogue is C- grade at best, but without the charm of over-the-top one-liners and hammy acting. Terrible pacing! We barely made it halfway through the film before we decided to start watching this like Trump watches movies - aka fast forwarding to all the gun battles and car chases.<br/><br/>And you'd think with nothing else going for it, they would have just made the violence the centerpiece of the film! When the eventual outcome is the same (bad guys get killed), you can at least get creative with how that happens! Shoot 'Em Up and Hardcore Henry tried very hard to be innovative in that regard, and it paid off. But in this film, literally 90% of the people die from a shot to the head. Maybe there's some half-hearted gun fu, and an occasional goon gets his from a stab wound or a broken neck. A goon or two gets tossed through a big window. But otherwise it's just headshots. John Wick - or rather, the director - must have played a lot of FPS games online in his formative years. And it shows: I would honestly have rather watched two hours of someone doing that, instead of wasting my time on this film.<br/><br/>Bottom line: avoid at all costs! Makes the guy who directed Jack Reacher look like Orson Wells. Anyone who rates this highly is either a paid shill or simply a philistine who knows nothing about films - not even mindless action. (At the time of writing, this is rated above 7, with over 300,000 votes...so take reviews and ratings with a huge grain of salt, if you don't already.) A sad, wasted opportunity to cast Nick Cage as Wick, and maybe salvage a star or two."

"imabean","9","7","17","17 January 2015"," I've never seen a more human meat-eating super assassin until John Wick.
","The film begins with John Wick stumbling from a badly-damaged SUV and falling to the ground, clutching his bleeding gut. With bloody fingertips he begins playing a video on his smartphone of he and his wife at the beach, in much better times.<br/><br/>We then flash back to Wick visiting his terminally-ill wife at the hospital to say his farewell, before telling the doctor to discontinue life support.<br/><br/>After the funeral, Wick receives an unexpected delivery, a puppy, along with a heartfelt note from his late wife, hoping that he will embrace this dog as a companion to remind him of her.<br/><br/>He goes for a drive, with the puppy (a beagle named Daisy) as his copilot. He stops for gas, whereupon a BMW full of Russian mobsters pulls up (one, the son of the local Russian mob boss, played by Game Of Thrones actor Alfie Allen). He takes a special interest in Wick's classic Ford Mustang, and takes offense to Wick rebuking his desire to buy the car.<br/><br/>As you might expect, the Russians invade Wick's home. They beat Wick senseless, and kill the puppy in front of him. He cradles the dead puppy in his arms, Wick's last and precious link to his beloved wife in the world, ignites the fires of vengeance in Wick which leads him to go on an all-out rampage against the Russians. This hearkens back in my mind to Will Smith's character in ""I Am Legend"", where his loyal German shepherd, Samantha, is about to turn, but he strangles it to death before that can happen. Samantha represents Will's character's daughter; Daisy represents Wick's departed wife.<br/><br/>From here, Keanu Reeves' kung fu skills garnered from the days of The Matrix rise up and reveal the super assassin lying beneath this otherwise mild-mannered widower. Keanu Reeves plays the role as a very elegant, methodical, deadly killer.<br/><br/>It's worth mentioning that the hotel Wick visits, The Continental, is an interesting and classy hangout for elements of the criminal underworld. Wick seeks a room at this hotel as his safe haven and as the proprietor states, ""no business may be incurred on these premises without *heavy* penalties"". <br/><br/>The end of the story shows the mob in shambles. As Wick, severely injured, finds his way into a veterinary clinic for supplies to staunch his wounds, he hears a puppy cry out. The clipboard attached to its kennel reveals it's to be euthanized the next day.<br/><br/>The final scenes show Wick walking out, a pit bull puppy on a leash accompanying him. One of the best action flicks I've seen, it has made its way into my top list of films."

"vistheindian","7","7","17","23 November 2014"," The one is back!
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a highly skilled ex-hit-man who receives a puppy from his dying wife to help him grieve. Things only get worse when a spoiled son of a crime boss steals John's car and murders his puppy. Now he must return to the criminal world he had left years ago to avenge all that he has lost. You have heard and seen this type of plot countless times, there are no surprises here, you will predict everything. But is it fun? Oh yes it is. Keanu owns his role and is a complete badass. So despite the unoriginality of the plot, John Wick is filled with some of the most original gunfights I've seen in a long time. Overall this movie is an entertaining pop-corn action flick that is well worth your time.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I think most would agree that Keanu Reeves is no thespian when it comes to his acting talents. So even though he has been in some terrible movies lately I still find to be a likable actor. I just want him to return to his glory days of being Neo, and John Wick seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to do that, so I was more than I excited to see it.<br/><br/>Let's be real here, this movie could have come off very cheesy judging by its premise. However, Keanu through his action persona sold me on this seemingly odd world and character as being real and actually quite cool. You can see Reeves wholeheartedly dedicating himself to his role that you can't help but cheer him on for every brain splattering headshot (strange thing to cheer I know, but you'll know what I mean). Most importantly, this is an action film that actually shows the action. From what I can remember there was not a single shaky cam, every gun fight is brilliantly shot (pun intended) beginning to end. I also loved how precise the movements were, John Wick would always land a headshot and if he can't then he would shoot another part of the body to get an aim at the head. Just plain awesomeness.<br/><br/>John Wick is not without its problems. As I mentioned before the plot is largely unoriginal, so whenever there are no fights the movie is not as engaging. Also I was quite underwhelmed by the climatic end. The rest of the movie had a great build in tension but the finale felt rushed, and left more to be desired. One of the positives of John Wick is the rich criminal underworld. It is filled with colorful characters and has very interesting ways in which it functions. There is a sense of mutual respect amongst the people in that world. I just wish we got to explore more of that world because I found it to be so intriguing and unique. I am sure they will if there ever is a sequel, which I do think this movie deserves.<br/><br/>In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching John Wick. Yes it has some flaws, but I was able look past them to appreciate it for what it is.

","I grew up watching movies with alpha males doing what alpha males do. whether it was the 60's with John Wayne, Lee Marvin, Sean Connery and Steve Mcqueen. The 70's with Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Roger Moore, Gene Hackman and Burt Reynolds. Or the 80's with Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stalone, Steven Segal, Arnold Scwarzeneggar, Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson and Van Damn. Something happened in the 90's with regards to the action genre, and Keanu Reeves was the only actor from that time forward who ever seemed to keep the tradition going, I liked Speed, the Matrix better and John Wick best of all. Reeves like all the names I mentioned get's guff for not being a ""Serious Actor"". My retort..who cares? While hold overs from early years like Willis, Segal, Gibson Van Damn and stalone continued making descent action flicks after the 90's. Reeves is the only actor I can think who basically came on the scene in the 90's who stayed true to his roots and is single handily keeping this genre alive. <br/><br/>John Wick is a dark film that reminds me of Blade Runner, Dark City, and From Hell with regards to production, only the lens filter used in this movie was so dark it almost becomes distracting. (this is not the only recent film I can think of that has this problem) Aside from this one technical problem, the movie was perfect. While not as gritty as Able Ferrera's Fear City or as comic book as The Payback from the 90's it seems to meet in the middle of these two films somewhere. The action scenes are some of the best ever put to film, the soundtrack animates the movie as much as the fight sequences, and it has absolutely Zero political correctness factor to it which is so refreshing. I liked this movie a lot. Long love the man of action."
"stevenrotherforth","10","4","8","1 March 2017"," Now this is how you make an action movie!
","John Wick<br/><br/>A good action movie is a rare thing these days. Stallone, Arnie and all the heroes of old have become... well just that ...Old! Instead we have watered down action stars who rely on shaky cam to hide their lack of ability. Keanu Reeves however has always been a strong performer within this genre. A star who's action credentials go under the radar despite being in some of the best of all time. The Matrix, Speed, Point Break and Johnny Mnemonic. No wait forget the last one that was rubbish! So when a little movie by the name of John Wick turned up on our cinemas door step this was a nice surprise for action fans. Watching a geriatric Steven Seagal nearly putting his back out to get our action fix was becoming a little strained. Or watching Jean Claude and Dolph mumble through rehashes of movies they'd done before. Universal Soldier 14 anyone? John Wick is rather refreshing. This is a simple movie. Nasty men steal nice mans Ford Mustang and kill his puppy. Turns out nice man is an ex super assassin and his wife has just died! Time to get not so nice. Talk about picking on the wrong guy! The fella from Game of Thrones, the one who gets his wedding tackle cut off (Alfie Allen) is to blame for doing John Wick wrong. His crime boss father points out in one of the films many great scenes, ""John Wick is the man you send to kill the boogeyman and you just killed his dog!"" Absolutely brilliant! The way in which the myth of John Wick is created is truly fascinating. A story about a bar room and a pencil is wonderfully realised on screen helping give the titular character an air of invincibility. I think this film works so well because we care for John and understand what he's going through. We feel his pain. He's lost his wife. He's lost the very thing that guides him. A love that rescued and steered him away from his violent past. Keanu Reeves gives a stellar performance here. We feel the emotion ooze out of the screen. We see him descend back into his old ways. All he wants to do is grieve and the bad guys take that from him. Watching the scene with the dying puppy is one that will pull at the heart strings and fuel a violent anger in you, one you probably didn't know you had. John Wick has some interesting depth too despite being a simple film in terms of formula. The assassins world in which John is from is one of code and honour. There are rules. A world that is stylised on screen and one that could be expanded on when a sequel inevitably arrives. But what is an action movie without good action? Something that JW delivers big time. Every punch, kick and exploding head is delivered with a level of professionalism that just isn't seen very often in this genre anymore. As I mentioned before directors usually now rely on shaky cam or obscure camera angles to hide the fact that the lead actor just isn't up to it. Here we have wide angles where we can see the action played out to full potential. A visual feast for the action movie aficionado. Not over done or overly repetitive. Keanu Reeves is very good at his craft. Particularly when his craft requires him to kick ass on screen. People have criticised his acting ability but for me he is one of the best when it comes to action. He does most of the stunt work himself. Sure there are probably better martial artists out there or guys with bigger muscles but Reeves is a more all round package. Along with some colourful cinematography and ear popping sound, this is what we want from an action movie. I for one look forward to seeing him return but please don't harm anymore dogs. I don't think I could take it."
"glop1993","10","4","8","11 January 2017"," A Flurry of Fun
","Disclaimer: I love this movie. It's basically the best one ever made. I'm not usually this positive when it comes to evaluating film, but I believe that this particular one deserves all the acclaim and more.<br/><br/>The thing that stands out most has to be the action sequences. They are unlike most found in modern cinema with long, uninterrupted takes and beautiful choreography that really lend themselves to the realistic, bone-crunching feel of the film. Although the complexity of plotting left something to be desired, the filmmakers more than made up for it by building a rich, creative, history-laden world around their characters.<br/><br/>The Action: The superb action in this movie can be directly attributed to the co-directors and their star. Both directors have been performing and coordinating big-budget film stunts for years. Chad Stahelski even doubled for Keanu Reeves in several films. Reeves's stunt background and dedication to learning his character's gunplay and martial arts styles helped bring his scenes to life in a way that would not be possible with other performers. Because of the crew's skills in the art of choreography, less cuts were needed during fight scenes which afforded them a more immersive feel.<br/><br/>The Music: I have never been one to get too worked up, or bogged down, by the soundtrack of any given movie. Here, however, I found myself enthralled in its effectiveness. The gentle tune ""In My Mind"" by M86 and Susie Q really stood out by paradoxically fitting perfectly into the hot tub club scene. On the other end, Marilyn Manson's ""Killing Strangers"" provided a jolting assault of the rock variety to wake me back up for the next action sequence.<br/><br/>The Supporting Players: Numerous interesting characters populate this original world. The performances that stand out the most come courtesy of John Leguizamo and Lance Reddick. Their introductions pulled me right into their specific areas of the criminal underworld without feeling too overbearing. Though neither muggs the screen for more than ten minutes, their impacts are felt immediately and leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>The Continental: As well-executed as John Wick is, I don't think it gets nearly enough credit for its creativity. The best use of this aspect can be seen inside the hit-man hotel, The Continental. This establishment primarily hosts assassins and other underworld types to be waited on by a staff providing world-class service to its patrons unlike any other. Most importantly, the hotel pulled me in leaving me wanting to know more about the history of this world to which we had just been introduced.<br/><br/>The Plot: My biggest gripe with the movie has to be that the plot wears quite thin at times. Having scanned countless other reviews before writing my own, I know that this is not an unpopular opinion. It's really just a classic tale of revenge where the protagonist pursues the antagonist until somebody gives in. The reason John Wick does not suffer for its overly simplistic plot is that it stimulates the viewer in other ways like a good-old-fashioned sense of humor. It never takes itself too seriously.<br/><br/>I can't image that they'll come anywhere near matching the magic of John Wick with its sequel, but I'm excited for Chapter 2 all the same. As long as they expand upon the interesting underground lore presented in the first movie while preserving the high quality action scenes, I have no doubt that Chapter 2 will satisfy my need for more John Wick."

","I think porn movies have more logically structured plot than this, and better acting. Keanu Reeves is playing Keanu Reeves. The other guys seem to be either slacking on the scene or a zombie-like walking around waste material.<br/><br/>The only thing that seems nice is the scenery composition and camera work, but you get so bored after the first half-hour that the only thing that keeps you going is the thought ""could it get any dumber?"" And it does - the cheesy ending definitely puts a comma until next sequel. <br/><br/>Good thing we were watching this at a friend's house, otherwise there would be PTSD symptoms of money well wasted.

"PlanetJoe","6","4","8","7 February 2016"," Who needs a plot?! lets shoot things for two hours.
","With such good reviews for this nonsense it only shows the dumbification of movie audiences nowadays. No need for plot, no need for characters, no need for a story. Let's just make a crazy revenge for a stolen car and dead dog. Where it begins with the protagonist randomly runs into the antagonist at a gas station. From there just have the protagonist shoot out at an army of people who attack him one by one. When the antagonist finally catches the protagonist they have to have a conversation before leaving the protagonist to be killed by two guys who try to kill him with a bag over his head. And of course after the protagonist gets out of that situation there's more shooting where one guy kills dozens of other guys who attack only one or two at a time and of course ends with the last two fist fighting in the rain. Really? A construction site with rain? Running out of ammo and finishing it with a fist fight. If thats not a throw-up-in-your- mouth clichÃ© I don't know what is. It's a stylish nonsense with wall to wall clichÃ©s and oh so predictable. It was like watching someone play a visually good video game where the player selected super easy mode just for the shoot out fun. What frustrated me the most is that it got so many good reviews. Is this what film audiences are made of nowadays? Really? Film is doomed if this is what the viewers will lure Hollywood to manufacture to satisfy the dumb audience who don't care for plot, character, storyline etc. just lots of shooting and you're happy. Sad."
"gokeymichael","10","4","8","29 June 2015"," Big Fan of John Wick
","I am a big fan of Keanu Reeves, have been for three decades. I don't care about critics of his acting ability or style. His style is unique and that's what separates him from other actors. Over the years he has been put in a certain mold, the mold of the quiet weird guy. Neo or Klaatu from The Day the Earth Stood Still, that type. Think of Tom Ludlow from Street Kings. That would be as close to John Wick as you can get as far as comparisons. But John Wick is much more bad-ass. He is a retired hit-man who has found love for the first time. The description on IMDb describes what happens so this stuff is not a spoiler. He loses his wife and you can tell that it was devastating. After her funeral he receives a pet carrier at his door and signs for it. It is a puppy. Cute as hell! It is a gift from his wife, a last gift in order for him to grieve with someone and not alone. You can tell he falls in love with the dog. Between that and the fact that it was a gift from his dead wife, it makes the dog that much more important. When a mob bosses son, (Alfie Allen), and his crew decide they want Wicks 69' Mustang, sweet car indeed, they break in and catch him off guard. He is retired. They beat him senseless and then kill the dog. Bad move. They should have killed Wick, but they don't know who is. But his father does. Viggo, the Russian mob boss and former employer of John Wick. He then has to explain to his disappointment of a son that he just killed the dog of the man that is not the boogeyman, but he is the guy you call to kill the boogeyman. From there things go from bad to worse for all involved. A lot of death. A lot of blood, gunfire, hand to hand fighting. Car chases, explosions and slimy hit-men and women out for a bounty. There is also a hotel that is specifically designed for the shady world that John Wick and other hit-men live in. Pretty cool. Keanu is at his best in this movie, not just physically, but emotionally. Yes, his character is quiet just like you would expect from Keanu. But once he gets going, he is one scary dude. Cold as ice. Great acting by all involved and great story. Just a wonderful movie all around. I don't care how many movies they make in this genre, as long as they all stand up to John Wick."
"claudio_carvalho","7","6","14","1 March 2015"," Don't Mess with Mr. John Wick
","A man called John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is grieving the loss of his beloved wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) that has recently deceased from an illness. He goes to her funeral and receives the condolences from his old friend Marcus (Willem Dafoe). Out of the blue, John receives a special delivery at home with the last gift from his wife, a cute dog that becomes his pride and joy. John goes to the gas station in his Mustang 1967 and the Russian Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) asks the price he wants for his car. John tells that it is not for sale and returns home. During the night, Iosef, who is the son of the powerful Russian mobster Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), breaks in his house with other gangsters and steals his car, beat John and kills his dog. Soon Iosef learns that John Wick was the unbeatable hit man Boogey Man that worked for his father and he should have never messed with him. Now, John Wick has lost everything he had and he wants the head of Iosef and he is back. But Viggo decides to protect his son at any cost and will pay the price. <br/><br/>""John Wick"" is one of the best action thrillers that have been recently produced by the industry, with a great story of arrogance and payback. Keanu Reeves is sensational in the role of a hit man that returns to his previous life to seek revenge against the man that took everything he had to support his grieve. It is cool to see the code of honor of killers and mobsters and how John Wick kills his enemies. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""De Volta ao Jogo"" (""Back to the Game"")"

","Before I start, I feel I have to state that John Wick is more than just another Popcorn Movie. Its stunning choreography, seamless switching-up of fighting styles and without a doubt; its cast, are impeccable. Reminiscent of other revenge thrillers such as 'Taken,' and 'The Man from nowhere;' John Wick enthrals the audience with it's visuals while keeping you connected with it's personal performances. Keanu Reeves was born to play the part of John Wick; the nice, quiet guy with a big dark secret. If you're looking for a movie you need to watch twice to fully grasp it's countless layers and subplots; go watch Memento, or Donnie Darko. If you're looking for a movie you want to watch twice because you have to show your buddy what a bada** Keanu Reeves' is; then look no further. John Wick is as manly as a steak dinner washed down with a 6-pack of PBR. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and cannot wait for John Wick 2."
"quinn-cunniff","9","5","11","26 July 2015"," Amazing Action
","John Wick: a movie that I watched this past Friday, and as I said, it's the better equalizer. Keanu reeves really kills it in his role as John wick, and it is actually perfect how his character is made. He is like the headshot king, but because of retirement he is just rusty enough where he has a chance of dying. Like superman vs ironman, still effective, but can die with enough force. The lead up to his character is amazing, and the mobsters describing him make John wick sound like Dirty Harry and Jason Bourne in one. An amazing movie, quick yet badass kills, and I'm not saying any to spoil the movie, but just general amazement throughout. I'm just sad that this film will probably get forgotten. So people, tell your friends that John wick is an 8.5.If you guys want more in depth reviews, please be sure to check me out, Quinn C with the James Bond emblem, on YouTube.

"HelenMary","8","5","11","9 July 2015"," Astonishingly good. Stunning cinema.
","Reeves is back to his Point Break, Speed, Matrix action-best. Wick a violent, visceral fast-paced high kill-rate film with a vintage slick and eminently cool feel to it. Reeves owns the screen, and reveals a physicality which belies his age. He throws himself around and is believable as the suave professional 'mechanic' anti-hero.<br/><br/>The story - I'll admit - is a little far-fetched if you take it too seriously, the bad guys are a little hammy and one-dimensional but Reeves brings a grace and gravitas to the role of Wick which shows off just how good he is. The martial arts are unusual, original and superbly choreographed and, like Jackie Chan, Wick uses anything to hand and is more fragile and realistic than most action anti-heroes, he is breakable and you believe he might just not make it. Cute puppy scenes, cuter puppy and Keanu scenes - is there anything better than a scene with a handsome man and a gorgeous puppy? The brutal scenes with the dog - Daisy - will upset some but bear with the film. It's quietness and lack of complex dialogue works well with Reeves and the story, there is a calm about him which is a juxtaposition to what he does for a living, is capable of, and this is depicted rather well with the unusual punky/rock soundtrack.<br/><br/>Watch it. Probably a favourite for boys everywhere, martial arts fans, Keanu fans and definitely ladies that like guys with guns and an easy power that makes your knees wobble. It is a stunningly shot film... an old school feel, slick, and dark and totally entertaining."
"alindsay-al","10","5","11","12 April 2015"," An epic action film that may go down as one of the best ever
","With it finally getting a UK release I finally got a chance to see the much hyped John wick and my goodness did this film deliver. The premise of this film sees an ex hit man who has lost everything going after the men who took it all away from him. Now I have never been a huge keannu Reeves fan but I gotta say he fits this role perfectly. He was a badass who dished out allot of headshots on villains but also you connected with his character because you believed in what he was doing and in his motivations. The villain is the bad guy from mission impossible ghost protocol and he wasn't really that memorable in that film. But he is fantastic in this film he is a multi layered villain that provides a good adversary for John wick and you buy that he could do some of the terrible things that he does in the film. Willem Dafoe is in the film and even though his role isn't that large he is great in it and makes you care about his character as well as John wick. Adrianne pallicki is one of my favourite actresses to watch at the moment and she was great in this film. She was deadly, sexy and evil which made her an awesome character in this film. The only negative was the bad guys son was really annoying and yes I get that because he is meant to be but it felt over the top. If you had described the story to somebody before seeing this film they would tell you that it couldn't work. But it just does in this film the premise is so simple that it works and you really want John wick to succeed in his mission. The script is surprisingly really good and it actually had more humour then I expected which is surprising because the trailer made it seem like complete darkness. The style of this film is phenomenal, I have never seen a person hit more headshots in a film then John wick and the action scenes are great and a reminder of what good action films can be. Also what is great is the world building in this film with unique ideas given to this film that I think they can really build on in future films which I hope there is. Overall John wick is fantastic and is one of the best action films I have ever seen."
"ajdbarros","2","5","11","21 March 2015"," Every famous actor has to pay his bills
","In the wake of Matrix, Reaves is Wick, still The One. Bad ass feared by all falls in love and retires. Just to come back to action to avenge the death of a ... dog? This may be the only creative idea in the whole movie. The rest is just brainless shooting. Our all powerful hero doesn't have any specific strategy for his revenge, just shooting a lot with a range of different weapons. The cast is full with known faces. But given the script did not cost much in terms of imagination, we could have had, at least, one fat-lipped big-boobed barely-clothed character to make things a bit more fun. And the end? Well, not that surprising given the fact that put all the killing in motion. My advice? Avoid this at all cost. If you miss Reaves kicking ass, go see Matrix I again."

","FINALLY. What seems like 30 movies I've seen with Keanu, he's impressed me.<br/><br/>John Wick is anything but original and yetit's thoroughly entertaining and just my type of bad guy/revenge flick. Not since 1999's Payback have I been this pleased. It's one of those movies I just finished and want to see all over again.<br/><br/>Through and through, 90% of this has been done before, but since Keanu finally stood up and acted and since it takes no prisoners with its brutality and shameless acts of gun violence, it's one for the books. <br/><br/>John Wick's the stereotypical badass retiree who's pulled back in on a whim and hell, everyone better watch their back. Reminding me a lot of both Payback and Eastern Promises, not to mention every single ""One- last-job-before-or-after-retirement"" plot, John Wick seems to separate itself with a Keanu you finally root for.<br/><br/>Literally, there's not much to say but to enjoy the enormously action packed ride of John, his past, his presence and how many bullets it takes to provide vengeance. It's a pity this didn't make more at the box-office. I could see this on repeat and not get bored.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Make your life complete with a double-punch/double- feature of this and Payback. (NOT the director's sh|t take of Payback. Just the original theatrical release.) Both are similar and will be having you root for the bad guy."

","Keanu Reeves is absolutely solid, as is everyone else. The action scenes are among the best I've ever seen. Stylised, but realistic. John Wick, the character, is insanely good and insanely tough, but not in an effortless way. That makes it seem more real.<br/><br/>The grittiness of the action scenes also adds to them.<br/><br/>Choreography is brilliant, cinematography is beautiful. These action scenes have a clear ""flow"", i.e. don't degenerate into a collection of fast moving extreme close-ups. The storytelling may be simple, but extremely well done in a visual way. All exposition scenes are visual and most contain little or no dialogue. <br/><br/>So I liked this one!"

I enjoyed every minute of it!Sure the plot seems a lot like a classic case of ""ex super ultra assassin being a one man army"" but it is well structured and never leaves you bored. The atmosphere is good and gives the feeling of a city that is governed by a crime syndicate. Acting is quite good compared to other recent action movies I saw lately. I hope Keanu Reeves continues to star in more good movies because he was quite unseen during the last decade or so with very few exceptions.

The acting was done well too. There were a few familiar faces from the small screen(HBO) as well. All of the characters were convincing and believable. John Wick(Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who is forced to come back to work to find the people who took everything from him. Like I said, it's simple but it's good.

","Saw it only after checking the IMDb-score, and that I regret. One of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. I didn't really expect much from Keanu Reeves, to familiar with his minimalistic vocabulary, but after The Matrix you really hope for another sudden flash of geniality, don't you? This wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>Storyline: Sucks. Straight forward from initial offense until final revenge. Could have ended several times before that, but that would have made the movie 25 minutes instead of 100. Which perhaps wouldn't be that bad... Some details are also completely lacking all sense of logic which is terribly annoying, but convenient for Mr Wick. <br/><br/>Action: Without any variation what so ever. Running and shooting at everyone with a red or cerise shirt under his jacket, being lucky that even when there's 20 opponents all of them wait for one another to try his luck killing Mr Wick. That makes it one clean kill after the other. Some exploding cars, a small fire, but otherwise just gunshots from close distance. Hundreds of them.<br/><br/>John Wick: For the first 20 minutes I nearly thought it could be a decent action movie. A heartbroken man that doesn't seem so heartbroken. More chronically depressed. He stays in that mode the rest of the film, and there's actually nothing cool about Mr Wick. No style or surprising skills. Just walking around shooting at everything, hardly speaking.<br/><br/>Music: Terrible and annoying. Rap, metal or whatever, that doesn't fit at all. <br/><br/>End: Unbelievably uncool and unrealistic. The ending climax/revenge is also totally without excitement or ""goal""-feeling. Just passes by.<br/><br/>PUNCHLINE: Don't waste your time on this movie. See something else. Even grab a movie you just saw that you liked. My girlfriend was actually getting rather depressed and annoyed after half the movie, and stayed in that mode for the rest of it (apart from a few laughs out of frustration from how unrealistic or uncool some scenes actually where). She didn't even mention how it ended but immediately left the sofa and started brushing her teeth in anger. Now, three days later she's forgiven me for dragging the movie into our home, as I promised her it would leave us with the trash bag, and that she could choose the next 10 movies we'll see together. That's pretty much all you need to know."

The plot went nowhere and the logic was totally missing. I heard that the producers of the Matrix were involved and hoped that the same darkness and depth would smolder in this movie but it just went on and on as if the viewer knew more than it revealed. The writers seemed to be in a video game state of mind as they went through the sequences. I waited to see the hook or revelation in the middle of this where nothing was done by mistake. Instead, it seems everything was random and coincidental which makes no sense. The bad guys just happen to encounter a well know retired assassin? I wish they would have a do over and have some depth and storyline added to this visual flop. I had rented a B movie as the opening act of my date night with my lovely wife and had this movie as the main feature presentation. The roles should have been reversed.

We should stop asking Hollywood to come up with original ideas, because when they do, this is the result. 101 minutes of cliched action that checks all of the boxes - retired hit-man coming out of retirement, a boy and his dog, the perfect wife who is conveniently dead, stolen cars, Russian mobsters, a spoiled son who doesn't have half the restraint and judgment of dad precisely because dad spoiled him, and lots of blood.

"moviesnbooze","4","2","3","27 May 2019"," Really disappointing for the most part - Maybe skip this and watch the Raid: Redemption (2011)
","Based off of critical and audience receptions alike, I hoped that John Wick would be the saving grace that the action genre needs in this day and age. I hoped that this would be the needle in the haystack of the newest additions to the Expendables, Die Hard, and Transformers franchises. I was expecting intense, fast-paced choreography, an intimidating villain, relatable motive, and stakes that actually felt like they held some weight to them. By the end of the film, my disappointment was immeasurable, and my day was ruined.<br/><br/>There's very little about this film that impressed me at all. Keanu did a fine job, but I was expecting a bit more, considering everyone regards him as a God now. The choreography was almost impressive, but I found that it was insanely slow, unexciting, and pales in comparison to something like the Raid. I was never bored. The dog was cute.<br/><br/>Part of what makes some of my favorite action films so special is that the audience is always on the edge of their seat, because at any moment, any of the on-screen characters could succumb to the lingering tension that's constantly in the air and actually die.<br/><br/>Stakes are one of the most essential aspects in an action film, yet this one lacks any. Because of the lack of tension, the action scenes suffer immensely. Not only are we constantly told that John Wick is invincible and can't be stopped, but we're shown this as well. We never see a hint of injury to him until the end of the second act, and even then, it feels completely unnatural and forced.<br/><br/>John Wick has next-to-nothing going for it in its story, which consists of three important plot-points: the villain, his wife, and his former buddy, Marcus. I'll go down the line and see how much each doesn't work<br/><br/>The villain is a hilarious clichÃ© that never feels intimidating in the slightest. From the moment we see our antagonist, we pretty much know exactly how the plot's going to play out all the way to the unsatisfying finale.<br/><br/>His wife's role had lots of potential to be an impactful and emotional beat in the film to be a reminder of why John is doing what he's doing, but she feels less like an organic character and purely like words on a script to get the story going where it needs to go. To give the audience a grip of how much she means to John, we are given exactly one montage and one video shown on a cellphone.<br/><br/>His friend, Marcus, has both problems mentioned above. Not only is his story extremely predictable, but you could hardly call him a character. You really couldn't care less whether he were to live or die. He is given a couple moments to shine in what is supposed to be tense, but comes off extremely goofy and laughable.<br/><br/>I might look like a goof nitpicking the story in an action movie, but when the action scenes don't work for me at all, what more am I left with?<br/><br/>There are a couple technical complaints such as ugly cinematography and bland music choices but nothing nearly as bad as everything else aforementioned.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this. I really did.
When's the last time we've had a great action trilogy? I want it so bad, but this disappointing entry makes me a lot less excited to watch the sequels."

(Cue the inevitable killing spree on said premises)<br/><br/>There's really nothing else to this film. It is laughable, with so many plot holes, but I can't stop watching a film once I've started so I ploughed through. Now I'm going to have to watch two sequels for closure.<br/><br/>If you like mundane gunfights and people being thrown over shoulders then shot in the head........this film is for you."

","I knew I wanted to see this movie one day, but after hearing so many recommendations, knowing it was a surprise box office hit, and obviously it spawned an equally successful sequel, I could not resist it. Basically John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has lost his wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) following her terminal illness, to cope with her death, he receives a Beagle puppy named Daisy, as per her instructions. John bonds with the dog, they spend the day driving in his vintage 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1, at a gas station he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters, their leader Iosef Tarasov (Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen) insists on buying his car, John refuses to sell it. The mobsters follow John home that night, knock him unconscious, steal his car, and kill Daisy. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop run by Aurelio (John Leguizamo), he recognises the car, upon learning that he stole it from John Wick, he punches Iosef and throws him out. John visits Aurelio, who tells him Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Michael Nyqvist), the head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York City. Viggo, finding out about Iosef's actions, beats and berates him, he tells him John Wick was his best assassin, nicknamed ""Baba Yaga"" (or the ""boogeyman""). When John wanted to retire and marry, Viggo gave him an ""impossible task"", implied to involve multiple assassinations, John succeeded, establishing the Tarasov syndicate. Viggo calls John to stop him seeking revenge, he silently refuses, so Viggo sends a twelve-man squad to kill him, but John kills them, and has the bodies professionally removed by Charlie (Commando's David Patrick Kelly) and his team. Viggo is unsurprised and puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, personally offering a contract to John's mentor Marcus (Willem Dafoe), meanwhile John stays at the Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no ""business"" on its premises. John learns from the Continental's owner Winston (Ian McShane), that Iosef is being protected at Viggo's nightclub the Red Circle, John kills his way to Iosef, but henchman Kirill (Daniel Bernhardt) ambushes John, allowing Iosef to escape. John tends to his injuries at the Continental, there assassin and his former acquaintance Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) sneaks into his room to kill him, but Marcus alerted him, he subdues Perkins and forces her to reveal where Viggo's front is, she knocks Perkins unconscious and leaves her with fellow assassin Harry (Clarke Peters) for punishment, but she breaks free and kills him. Little Russia church serves as Viggo's front, John travels there, destroys the hoard of money and blackmail material, Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking he could leave his old life behind, before John can be killed, Marcus intervenes again, John frees himself, kills Kirill and confronts Viggo, at gunpoint he reveals Iosef's location. John travels to Iosef's ""safe house"" and kills him, while Perkins tells Viggo that John and Marcus have been in contact, Viggo has Marcus tortured at his home, before he is executed, Viggo calls John to report this, and plans to have Perkins ambush him, but Perkins is called to see Winston, she is executed fro breaking the Continental's rules. Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo plans to escape by helicopter, John races to the harbour, killing the remaining henchmen, John and Viggo engage in a fistfight on the dock, John disarms Viggo pulling out a knife, then kills him. In the end, John is wounded, he stops at a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound, and he takes a pit bull puppy who was supposed to be euthanized, John and the dog walk home on the boardwalk where he had his last date with Helen. Also starring Dean Winters as Avi, Omer Barnea as Gregori and Toby Leonard Moore as Victor. Reeves proves a fantastic choice as the former hit-man that will not be messed with, it is a simple revenge plot as a man seeks retribution for those who stole his car and killed his dog, but the fast-paced editing, escalating body count and over-the-top death and fight sequences are highly skillful and well choreographed, the violence adds to the entertainment, it feels like something fresh, a fantastic action thriller. Very good!"

","Go see this film, don't miss it! Aside from Keanu's brilliant performance in this film, I also need to mention Michael Nyqvist and Willem Dafoe. This is an enthralling and gripping thrill ride of a movie, that builds to such a crescendo that you won't even know whats hit you when it finally does. It's slick, witty and powerful. There's a message hidden in all the action and drama this movie delivers. A message that will likely stay with you long after the movie is over. Keanu hasn't been better than this since the Matrix. Here you see Keanu really deliver on all levels. Michael Nyqvist is masterful and brings everything he needs to and then some in his portrayal of Viggo Tarasov, I don't think Viggo could have been played any better, seriously. And Willem Dafoe really knocks it out of the park as Marcus. Honorable mention to Alfie Allen in his portrayal of Iosef Tarasov as he really did great work in his performance here. The riveting feeling of the film, is has all we often hope for in a film like this and we're reminded again that is what we ideally crave. I do say, go see this in Imax, I think it's work the extra to do so."
"abouhelier-r","10","8","21","30 October 2014"," John Wick
","An ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him. <br/><br/>John Wick is a new action movie starring Keanu Reeves, directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Since a little while I'm a huge fan of Keanu Reeves and I watched many of his interviews; he really seems to be a very cool and down to earth gentleman. I've heard and read many positive things about John Wick. It's one of the best action movie of the year and possibly Keanu Reeves' best performance since a long time. It doesn't arcane back to the 80's action movies ,actually it's an excellent 2014 action movie, no nostalgia required. Firstly, this film blew my mind and Keanu Reeves gives a lot of himself which is such a great thing to see. He is the perfect actor for the lead role. Everything he does is cool: driving, fighting, shooting and even speaking. All those things in general are what an action hero has to do in a good action movie. He is bad ass but also as he's retired for a certain time it makes him rusty enough to produce an interesting and tensional movie. Plus, John Wick is a slick looking movie, with fantastic action scenes and most importantly and surprisingly great dialogue scenes as well. The main villain of the movie starring Michael Nyqvist (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Millennium) is absolutely terrific, Russians seems to always be the bad guys. In fact all the acting on this film is really good. I think it's actually Keanu Reeves' best film since The Matrix. Mainly because this film requires a lot of an actor, it's fantastic to see him properly doing the action scenes. He knows how to sell action; but I'm not only talking about physical work, he also has some very emotional scenes which involved a lot of anger and despair; he does a very great job with all of them. The screenplay is good, it's not only a revenge/ killing movie. There been a lot of action world creation, you learn a lot about these underworld war criminal. I completely understand why the hero goes on this bloody path. I have a dog. If anyone hurts my dog for any reason I'll do John Wick on them. Plus, the Club scene is the best scene of the whole movie, it reminds me of a club scene in Collateral which is crazy good action. However, the only flaw I could see in this film is the end; as my mum would say: the end seems a little bit forced up and a little bit put together really fast. That's it. Finally, John Wick also sets up ideas of sequel (not being forced like in The Maze Runner). You are able to see the character's evolution and the potential for a franchise along the movie. John Wick's the nicest guy ever just don't screw with him. <br/><br/>Overall John Wick has incredible shoot out sequences, it's anon-stop action movie that actually has a clever script, a really awesome hero, a great villain (a few great villains actually). It does everything an action movie is supposed to do, it understands what its doing and does it extremely well. Go see this film!"
"sniffynixon-33443","5","1","1","6 January 2020"," Mediocre action move.
","Basically this film consists of two hours of Keanu Reeves stylishly shooting people in the head. With a minimal plot devoid of tension this stylish action starts to become tediously predictable as the bodies with headshots start to mount up."
"kikoydaba3","6","1","1","1 November 2019"," 101 minutes of Keanu Reeves laying out henchmen after henchmen in a revenge thriller
","John Wick stacks the body count in a wickedly fun revenge thriller starring Keanu Reeves about a retired assassin drawn back to a previous life of murder and violence after a vicious break-in and theft led by a Russian mobster's son. Despite a thin script, 101 minutes of gratuitous violence ultimately pays off due to sheer spectacle, some stylish direction, and incredible action set pieces.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves has never been known as an actor with a wide range but instead limited to certain roles that show little emotion. As a character, John Wick is perfectly suited for Reeves. Characterized as an unassuming quiet, grieving widower, Wick is actually a no-nonsense former assassin in retirement after finding love. Coupled with director Chad Stahelski, a veteran stuntman and coordinator, and Reeves' history of playing badass male leads, this is the film to take Keanu Reeves back to previous career highs not seen since The Matrix trilogy and which would go on to launch a successful and critically well-received franchise. Reeves owns the role of Wick. The casting couldn't be more perfect.<br/><br/>Primarily, John Wick is centered on loss and revenge. Wick is out for blood against the people who took away everything important in his life. As an exploration of the aforementioned themes, the film only goes skin-deep, failing to dig deeper into the character's persona and background. Majority of Wick's history is shown through flashbacks and subtle dialogue. While the script leaves a lot to be desired, the character interactions aren't preachy, grounding the film on an emotional and human level. More importantly, Wick does not really grow as a character. He's not placed in a situation that questions his motives allowing room for him to grow.<br/><br/>The film takes its themes seriously, but perhaps intentionally, it's also a satire on the futility and value of masculinity. Characters within the film present this dual approach of tackling a subject matter common in Hollywood cinema. Iosef Tarasov, played by Alfie Allen, embraces hypermasculinity with his arrogant, selfish and entitled personality being the son of Russian Mobster Viggo Tarasov, played by Michael Nyqvist. John Wick is the exact opposite with a laid back attitude. Iosef initiates the plot of the film when he and his group conducted a vicious burglary that beat Wick, ransacked his home, killed his dog left behind by his deceased wife, and stole his treasured car. Unknowingly to him, Wick formerly works for his father and is nicknamed ""Baba Yaga"", Russian for ""Boogeyman."" As Wick hunts down Iosef, the opposite occurs between the characters as Iosef's toxic hypermasculinity is exposed as fraudulent when faced with an actual credible threat. Wick finds again the machismo he once discarded.<br/><br/>Themes of loyalty, word of honor and brotherhood are also present. Marcus, played by Willem Dafoe, is Wick's mentor and friend. Hired by Viggo to kill Wick, he broke the contract when another assassin, Ms. Perkins, comes in and vies for the prize, probably also out of mutual respect. He is tortured then murdered when Viggo learns of his betrayal. Ms. Perkins is killed for breaking The Continental's policy of no ""business"" transaction within hotel grounds. Lastly, Viggo is killed by Wick by protecting his son. In the criminal underworld, death is the ultimate fate.<br/><br/>John Wick's strengths are its direction and fight scenes. For lovers of neo-noir, Spaghetti Westerns and Hong Kong martial arts cinema, Chad Stahelski has great command, specifically in the cinematography department, in paying homages to his film's influences bringing a unique testosterone-charged modern twist of the genres. The score is also great from Tyler Bates, containing a mix of techno and rock music.<br/><br/>The sequel has lots of potentials that the first has failed to tackle. Put a heavier emphasis on character development, not just lip-service dialogue. Here's to hoping it exceeds the first.<br/><br/>6/10"

","""John Wick"" one of the best action movies I have ever seen. That's it, that could be all I said and it would be enough. I mean really, this movie is so great, when it ended I was searching for something that wasn't right and I really struggled to find a scene or moment I didn't enjoy.<br/><br/>Let's get the minuscule negatives I have with
this masterpiece out of the way. For one I didn't enjoy the last scene and thought it was forced. I also didn't really like what led to the 3rd act of the film and thought it was one of those things that had to happen to continue the movie. That's it. That's all the negative points I have to say about this movie because frankly, the rest is awesome.<br/><br/>Keane Reeves is amazing in this movie and so is everyone else, but his role in this cannot be understated, he gave it his all and it shows. The action is at points orgasmic and has such fluidity to it I found myself jaw-dropped at points.<br/><br/>The story is also pretty good, making us totally understand why John Wick decides to do what he does and while it's not revolutionary, it doesn't need to be because, in the end, this is an action movie with some of the greatest action I have ever ever seen, incredibly interesting characters and dynamics, superb comedy at points and that's all I wanted.<br/><br/>Basically flawless!<br/><br/>A"

Keanu Reeves is a treasure and this movie is amazing! Watch it. You won't be sorry."
"Koma-Mo","9","1","1","24 September 2019"," An original action flick that takes you for an awesome ride.
","The bait and switch that occurs here is fantastic. You start off watching John Wick mourning the death of his wife and rediscovers the meaning of life when he receives a puppy. When things hit the fan, you start to understand that there is more to the protagonist and immediately enter this bloodbath massacre with this complete badass. The plot is simple and yet you clearly understand the motivation and that this is one guy who you don't want to mess with. It's painful to see what happens, but the clear motivation is enough for even us to be onboard and cheering for this awesome character to kill some baddies.<br/><br/>Keanu doesn't get a lot of lines, but I thought he worked perfectly well here being such a tyrant with all of the stunt work and action scenes that he had done for this film. Which leads to one of the best things I can say and that is the action. Everything from the cinematography to the choreography, everything was shot in such detail, making this action flick so stylish and fun to watch. There were plenty of times where I reacted out loud just on how brutal or amazing a certain kill was. Based on the motivation of the character, watching him get his revenge is so satisfying, making this stand out from the more recent revenge flicks we have been getting. With so much memorable moments, it is hard to recall which was the most entertaining or which part of the film I had enjoyed the most. Every single moment brings in that necessary punch and not overstaying its welcome by showing too much action.<br/><br/>What this film gets right is building its world. You enter this world of assassins and rather than having long expositions that explain what goes around there, you are given enough glimpses and hints of the lore that has you intrigued and wanting to know more. The characters are all suave and each have their own characteristics, making this revenge flick all the more interesting. Everyone from the owner Winston, to even a few assassins that John Wick interacts with has such personality to them, making them quite memorable, despite the amount of screentime they have.<br/><br/>Even with its sequels, this film is still so fun to watch and its rewatchable. Definitely recommend this for anyone who loves action."

This is close-range, brutally effective, 'tier one operator'-level stuff. You can tell Reeves dedicated himself to this role with vigor and the results are spectacular.<br/><br/>The story is lean and slightly cliche as are the one-note Russian villains, but when the gun play and stunts are is this good, who cares. I could never buy Keanu Reeves in the role of a bad ass (the Matrix) but his his performance in John Wick is very satisfying and really sells the idea that this guy could kill everyone in the room with a pencil if need be.<br/><br/>If you love action, do yourself a favor and watch this film.

John Wick lives by a code very similar to the Bushido or a medieval knight. This movie is about honour and keeping your word no matter what the consequences may be. It's also about honouring the memory of those who have departed. It's almost like a fantasy world that exists beneath the normal world where the criminals work with their own currency, their own kingdoms and laws. In this universe the criminal underworld live by a very strict code of rules that if you break them you will die.

","For an action movie, it was so quiet. Sure, there was music and some talking but mostly the fighting and everything was so quiet. I liked it, but I'm not used to fighting scenes being built that way.
There was very little explanation for the story or the background or any character. We are just put into this world without any explanation what is happening or who anyone is. However, it is pretty easy to understand the chain and who is with or against John.
It was a good action movie with a lot of good actors.
Also, Michael Nyqvist is a great actor, but his Swedish accent is so prominent here. If you want to sound like a Swede speaking English, that is who you should sound like.
I liked that Keanu did his own fight scenes. Made it feel more badass that he puts in so much time for the fighting.
One thing, there were so many times they could have shot him, but instead of a clean shot they did the Bond villain thing over and over. Also, Wick can shoot several people while running and tumbling over things, but not a whiny manchild in a towel? That's the difficult one?"

It has some creative use of color, and good cinematography, but what holds it down for me is only a few cliches, over exposition, and under developed characters. It could be more creative, with a movie like this you can do anything that fits the excitement, but some things are very basic, like the exposition, some times it does a great job at the ""show don't tell rule"", then right after has the characters talking about John Wick's back story instead of just showing us, like I would prefer.

John Wick is a very focused character and if you get on his bad side you will know that you've made a mistake.<br/><br/>John Wick is very powerful, but he also isn't invincible.

","Bit of prep work ahead of seeing John Wick 3 here.<br/><br/>John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired hitman is forced back into that life when he's beaten, his car is stolen and his dog is killed by Iosef (Alfie Allen) the son of a Russia Crime boss (Michael Nyqvist). So begins Wick's act of supreme revenge as he uses his very specific skill set to track down and kill all of the crime syndicate.<br/><br/>Seeing it again, I was surprised at how much time ""John Wick"" gave to establishing the character and world before unleashing him. It's probably 25 minutes or so before the action really starts, which is helpful as those 25 minutes are really the building blocks that the three films have been based on. It does go some way to establishing the world of ""John Wick"" too, with glimpses of The Continental and establishing the rules of the universe that will become more important in the sequels.<br/><br/>Acting is not good, as you might imagine, though Reeves has somehow found a way to legitimise his one note deadpan style for Wick. The story is a basic revenge thriller but that's not really why we're here. We are here for glorious visceral expertly choreographed violence that has proved a stark contrast to the CGI heavy or edited within an inch of their lives action films that have been prevalent in the last few years. Though it's only a return really, to how films used to be made, particularly in the ""Hong Kong"" style, the fact it's been away for a while does make it feel like ""John Wick"" is special and unique."

The one man vs. the world is a great plot and is executed wonderfully. The backstory of John is mysterious and is revealed throughout the film. He's a wonderful retired guy and it is super entertaining to see his relationship with others. The antagonists are more like drones run by a leader as opposed to people. A great part of this movie is the cinematography, especially how it works in tandem with the choreography of the fight scenes.

I honestly would've agreed with my friend, but ""John Wick"" received amazing reviews when it came out, and I ended up seeing it opening weekend, and I was absolutely blown away. Yes, the film has a rather simplistic plot, but the world that it crafts is so much deeper than what you see onscreen (and that world is further elaborated on in ""John Wick Chapter 2"").

This movie's fight scenes differ from majority of the action sequences I have watched in different movies in both the editing and sound used during those scenes. The movie also does a great job the set making as the movie creates different scenes which match the ""vibe"" of each scene such as in the nightclubs, hotels, etc.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I would say that John Wick defies my expectations as an action film as the movie not only focuses on the amazing action scenes and showing John Wick's proficiency, but it also effectively builds the story around John Wick and the world that he lives in. As in the movie they also have different rules such as ""no killing on continental grounds"" and the presence of a hotel or place for assassins to stay and they even have their own currency which after watching many action movies, I did not come to expect an action movie to spend time where they introduce and show that John Wick and the world he lives in is complex and big."

","John Wick is a well made movie with good acting, visual effects, and sound design.

The movie's action scenes were well made, and the actors chosen to fit these roles performed well in these scenes. This, combined with well done visual effects and sound design, kept the audience on the edge of their seats. But despite this, the concept the plot is based of is quite shallow. Though the writers gave it more background and motive in an attempt to expound on the concept, their efforts are unable to fully mask its flaws in the plot.<br/><br/>For me, this movie was able to differentiate itself from most of the other action films that I have watched. What made the movie stick out for me was its ability to take a generally predictable plot formula and expound on it. Although storyline is not the movie's strongest points, thee film's writers were able to mask the concept and change the sequence ""formula"" to make it less predictable and more interesting."

","John Wick is a revenge drama which offers little along the lines of a story and and an excess of action. The story which starts off as interesting loses your attention almost as instantly. A retired hitman (or so they call him) single-handedly outmanoeuvres a flock of gangsters, including their boss.<br/><br/>Performances: Keanu Reeves as the titular character carries the burden of almost everything that happens in the rather short run of 101 minutes of the movie. Alfie Allen (hey there, Reek!), Adrianne Palicki and Ian McShane are decent in portraying their characters. Michael Nyqvist shines as the baddie boss.<br/><br/>Overall verdict: John Wick is another one of those stereotypical action movies, the only difference being that there is way too much action and gravity-defying stunts stuffed into it.

","""John Wick"" is an excellent action entertainer. However, it's not only that ; it is also very dark, intense , violent in an enjoyable way, and its action coordination is sharp and engaging. Keanu Reeves will always be remembered as the iconic ""John Wick"" ; similar to Sylvester Stallone's iconic characters of ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo"", and Arnorld's iconic ""Terminator"" role.<br/><br/>The basic story revolves around a former Hit-man named John Wick (Reeves), who is also known as ""The Boogey-Man"". When the son of a sophisticated gangster steals his car and kills his dog (the only remaining connection to Wick's recently deceased wife), John gets back to his ""killer"" mode to take revenge. Keanu Reeves is simply outstanding, menacing, and totally convincing as the dangerous hit-man. His devilishly-heroic style in this movie has set a new benchmark for the future aspiring action heroes.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well planned and perfectly executed by Keanu Reeves. Each action sequence is a feast for lovers of this genre. The direction is effective ; a dark and intense atmosphere has elevated the deadly nature of the criminal world shown in the movie. In conclusion, it is one of the best intense action thriller movies ever made."
"secondtake","6","11","32","24 November 2014"," Non stop monotony--beautifully filmed but a linear plot
","John Wick (2014)<br/><br/>I thought the weak point of this movie would be Keanu Reeves, since he's not the best actor in town. But instead it was the monotony of the killing, on and on, all at the same pace, with hardly a break.<br/><br/>I'm not complaining about violence here—that's what this kind of revenge movie is all about. Reeves plays a guy who used to be a trained assassin, one of the best, and he has to come out of retirement (you'll see why in the first ten minutes). And he is now after some of the people he once worked for, so they are formidable foes, and cruel.<br/><br/>But that's about it. The process of getting even takes up the rest of the movie, and there are the necessary clubs and warehouses, the muscle car antics and the flipping and diving while shooting your guns with perfect accuracy. Mostly there is just shooting and fighting and fighting and shooting. <br/><br/>So, how to make a movie that has this one-liner idea work? With psychology, cleverness, surprise, and even failure sometimes. You won't see any of that here. You also won't see humor. By luck, the preview for my showing (in a theater) was ""Die Hard,"" and what a reminder of a terrific action movie, where one guy has to kill a whole slew of enemies. But there it's funny, there are constant twists and turns, and you actually care about the hero.<br/><br/>That's another problem here: you care about Mr. Wick because he was wronged at the start, but he's not a sympathetic person. You just don't really worry about him. I suppose you know he won't die right away, so you are ""on his side"" more or less, but not with much investment. In a weird way, some of the villains were more compelling than Wick—the main bad guy is a terrific Michael Nyqvist (who is always really good), and Willem Dafoe plays a terrific small, key part.<br/><br/>I might have left a movie this straight forward if it weren't for one thing—it's photographed well. The camera, light, and generally the editing, are all elegant and almost pretty, in a good way. The sets are filmed in a logical way that moves you through the spaces through the eye of the camera with confidence and dark beauty. Good stuff, and it had my eyes glued.<br/><br/>Now give the thing something more and glue the rest of me."

There were stirring hand to hand combat scenes and verbal responses to the death scenes as I sat in my chair feeling the adrenaline throbbing in my insides. As for the performances, the acting was satisfying enough for an action flick, except for Willem Dafoe he was excellent, but c'mon he's always excellent. <br/><br/>The action sequences were handled very nicely every shot was sharp and precise unlike recent action films that use shaky cam techniques, where you can't even identify whose fighting who. Which makes this a very refreshing action film, and highly satisfying for any one who wants Neo back on the big screen. I would highly recommend this film for any action lovers or any Keanu Reeves fan *(and Willem Dafoe). Hands down best 2014 Action flick and a successful resurrection for Kenau's career."

He hasn't been in a decent, big release film for some time now, and here, he proves he still has it. Screen presence that is, not acting chops.<br/><br/>Plus its one of those films that just doesn't try too hard to be anything other than it is, a revenge thriller, plain and simple. What is clever is that it's not just the dog Wick is peeved about, it's the fact that this was the last thing his wife gave him, and for Wick, the dog signified ease of the grieving process, and her legacy would sort of continue every time he looked in the puppy's eyes.<br/><br/>If your a huge dog lover, be prepared to be upset, that's all I'm saying on that matter, but rest assured, the punishment fits the crime, over and over, and over again.<br/><br/>Its a very slick affair, the action is effortlessly cool, and the nightclub scene, is one of the highlights of the whole movie.<br/><br/>At times,the movie reminded me of 'Wanted', especially when it was set in the strange hotel for hit men, and then other times, it reminded me of 'Crank' because of its bizarre characters, and bonkers narrative.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Reeves, here's the movie you've been waiting for side that awful rave in Zion, for others, its a visual feast, all style over substance, with some great support from the likes of McShane, Dafoe, and even Alfie Allen.<br/><br/>Its Most Excellent, and never once Bogus..."

The cop just acknowledges the dead bodies on the floor and just walk off. Wick hardly shows a bruise after some horrific punches thrown his way. Wast of money and waist of time. That's two hours I'll never get back.<br/><br/>Kanue Reeves in John Wick is a poor attempt to get some Jason Bourne money. Next....."

","John Wick: In the 90's and early 2000's, any action movie with Keanu Reeves was a must--see movie for all. In the past eight years or so, Keanu Reeves practically went off the map and no one knew if he was still acting anymore. Then, he suddenly decides to pick up where he left off and return to action. ""Everyone's been asking me if I'm back, yeah I'm thinking I'm back- John Wick."" With the plot of John Wick somewhat laughably mimicking the career of Keanu Reeves, we cannot help but enjoy the thrilling ride of seeing a solid action film.<br/><br/>I do not usually give the plot of the film but I feel it is appropriate for this one. John Wick, a once great hit man, comes out of retirement from his peaceful quiet life to track down the men who took everything he had, showing he has not lost his touch at what he does. With the exception of trying to enact revenge on people who wrecked his life, that plot sounds a lot like Keanu Reeves's career. That is why I thought he was perfect for the role and why the role was perfect for him. <br/><br/>I would have given this movie a higher rating if it was not for the fact that I have seen this type of movie many times before. In fact, John Wick reminded me a lot of a movie I saw a month ago called The Equalizer which has an extreme number of similarities with John Wick. If it was the first time I ever saw a movie with this plot, it would be one of my favorite films. Sadly, it is not the case and I never was really surprised with the direction the movie went.<br/><br/>Enough about that, time to get on to why I still liked the movie. The main reason the movie is very enjoyable is because it accomplished what it wanted as solid action film. It did not try to do more or get overly complicated in it's own plot leaving the audience lost. It was clear-cut and direct, what many films are not successful achieving. There is no one is better to achieve it than Keanu Reeves. I am not sure if the script was written with Keanu Reeves in mind or if it was just cast perfectly. Whatever the case may be, the intimidating, quiet, resourceful guy pretty much describes Keanu Reeve's bread and butter role. The rest of the cast did their job accordingly, but Keanu Reeves definitely shines in his return to action films. <br/><br/>If you are in a theater where they are showing both John Wick and The Equalizer, flip a coin and you will enjoy both of them equally. Still, I recommend you see John Wick at some point while it is still in theaters. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

","Gritty, stylish and fast paced action film with very overused revenge/back from retirement plot. But you don't even notice the paper thin plot because of the strong characters and well directed action scenes. There were not a single dull moment in this hour and half long film. It was very good that writer/director didn't waste much time on the John Wick character's back story. We got to see the glimpse of his life and that was all the viewer needed. The mystery behind John Wick only grows when we see the first reactions of some other characters, when they learn that he has been attacked. It wasn't only John Wick's character that actually evolved without much development. Every talking scene we learned to know the players more and more, but just enough to keep them mysterious and keep us still interested. It's something that is missing in most of the newer action films. Real powerful acting work. It was real pleasure to see Keanu back at his top form. And kudos to the screenwriter who managed to write Russian dialog that actually sounded little bit like Russian, not just some pointless gibberish. And of course the actors, who managed to speak it understandably."

","So after his dog and wife die, and after his car is stolen John Wick(Keanu reeves) gets angry, comes out of retirement, and spends the whole movie killing mobsters with action music in the background...This movie was non-stop action, almost literally...it was a great movie and lots of big name actors would did a tremendous job. Best action film probably in the last 5 years...not the best movie all round, but for pure action, this takes top grades. Probably my favourite Keanu movie, even better than The Matrix. This movie has a few twists but it is very predictable. Which doesn't matter because its how he gets from start to finish that is worth the ride, not the story."

","John Wick is my kind of action movie. It's simple, strait to the point, and builds a truly unique crime world while not taking itself too seriously. It's just fun. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a quiet man who has given up his career of an assassin to care for his dying wife. The film opens up with her funeral and wake. What disease did she die from? It never says, but it doesn't matter. What does matter, is that John Wick is hurting from his loss and we can clearly see this. As a last gift before her death, his wife gets him a puppy to help deal with the grief. The movie does a terrific job of building a believable love for the dog in a short period of time. After showing interest in John Wicks car, young gangsters break in to Johns house, beat him up, kill the dog, and steal his car. Big mistake. After this, the movie never stops. It is wall-to-wall action, and it is good. <br/><br/>The performances are solid all around. Willem Defoe is great as John wicks old friend, Marcus. And Michael Nyqvist is particularly entertaining as the leader of the crime world. But it is Keanu Reeves we come to see. This man has not lost his edge. From what I've gathered from other people's opinions, you either love Keanu or hate him. I like him. They don't give him too much dialogue here, but that's a good thing. Keanu plays a hardened killer very well and his actions speak far louder then words. Apparently, he did 90% of his own stunts for this film. And for the amount of stunts here, that's damn impressive. I liked that the film builds up how much of a badass John Wick is by telling us how much he is feared in the crime world. They call him the boogeyman for pete sake.<br/><br/>Lets talk about the setting. The filmmakers have done an excellent job of building a crime world that is colorful with stylish neon lights but dark and seedy all at the same time. I particularly like how everyone involved in this world pays with gold coins. It was a cool touch to let the audience know who is inside and who isn't. <br/><br/>My gripes. I felt the ending to be a little lack luster after such a terrific ride. But I guess it left me wanting more. Also, some of the lines seem a bit out of place in a cheesy way. But all in all this is a great action film with a star that was in desperate need of a win. Keanu defiantly won with this one."
"destroyerwod","8","8","22","4 November 2014"," Old school badassery at its best
","This movie truly feel like returning back in time, but with today's technology and style. It had a mix of Commando for the ""one man army"" set-up but without the one liners and corny style. Keanu Reeves/John Wick definitely succeed at being both a bad-ass character, but somebody that you truly feel for.<br/><br/>I was reading other reviews and one point that stand out also to me is even tough the movie is fast to start, there ain't too much build up, you still care a lot for that man. When the dog is kill, despite the short time he spent with it, i still felt his pain and grief. The guy had nothing left beside a dog and a car, and they took it from him.<br/><br/>So yeah this movie is just pure old school greatness, like you don't see many these days. There is even a small role for Bloodsport's Daniel Bernhardt which was also in The Matrix Reloaded, and there first fight is extremely satisfying.<br/><br/>The movie include lots of gunfights, a fair amount of hand to hand combat, some car chases scene, and pretty much everything you expect from an action movie, its really a great time."

","Enter the world of mob hit men, John Wick was the greatest the Russian mob ever had as a hired asset, dubbed not as the Boogeyman, but as the one they call to kill the Boogeyman. John then retires after finding a girl and marrying. Recently losing his wife to an illness, John receives her final gift, a dog he named Daisy, so that he can continue on loving something. One day, Iosef, the Russia mob's crown prince who don't know the mob's history, attacked John, killing Daisy and taking John's '69 Boss Mustang, after John previously denied his offer to buy the car. The Russian mob kingpin Viggo, Iosef's father, tried to negotiate with John, only for john to hang up the phone on him. John easily snuff out the hit men Victor sends at him. Viggo hires Marcus, John's old friend to kill John. Meanwhile John goes to stay at the Continental hotel, which is actually a neutral place where hit men don't kill each other. He meets old acquaintances there; Perkins and Winston, who informs him of Iosef's location. John storms the place, killing many henchmen, but Iosef slips away. <br/><br/>When John returns to the Continental, Marcus has a clean shot opportunity at him, but he shoots a warning shot as Perkins storms into the room. John neutralizes her, extracts some info and leaves her to another 'hotel guest'. John goes and burns Viggo's money stash but then he gets caught. As Viggo leaves John for his two henchmen to kill, Marcus snipes one of them and John takes care of the other. He then storms at Viggo but he lets Viggo live after he tells him Iosef's location. John storms the place and quickly kills Iosef. Viggo doesn't stand still and has Perkins kill Marcus for not killing John when he had the chance. The Continental's 'management' goes to Marcus's place and execute Perkins for breaking the Continental's rule. They also inform John of Viggo's location. John storms the place, impeding Viggo's run. John and Viggo have a final fight where John intentionally lets himself get stabbed by Viggo only to lock his arm, retake the knife and jam it to Viggo's neck. John then gets another dog from a dog shelter.<br/><br/>Okay, I admit the story feels like a lame choice for a movie. For me personally, it even gets to feel like a guilty pleasure. There's no real invention at the story; a hard boiled killer going out his retirement to exact revenge. There's really nothing new added to this movie. It's even so very predictable in how the story unravels itself. All the elements of a classic ninety-minute revenge action movie is there; the cause, the conflict, the hunt, and the target escaping once or twice before the final showdown.<br/><br/>Yet I find that this movie really knows what other elements to maximize to compensate for the mediocre story. It nicely grasp the dramatization of the revenge cause as a sad story but also simultaneously as funny. I really like the screenplay and dialog emphasize this on the way Aurelio explains his story and Viggo's reaction early on. The dialog on that part is a superb piece that cracked my laugh. But then it gets back to serious as we see John stroking the dead Daisy's head.<br/><br/>The action is also a strong point in this movie, possibly even it's strongest point. Unlike typical action movies, this movie doesn't offer realistic tactical firefights as the most of the shootings happen in up and close point blank range. There's also less of beautifully choreographed martial arts trade of moves as the fights quickly turn into ground grappling moves which is the most realistic choice to go in the real world. Instead at times the character John Wick presents us with quite a combination of gun shooting and fighting, making him look like he's doing a hard and stylish action of 'gun dance'.<br/><br/>The acting is just a decent overall work for me. Keanu Reeves did great in portraying the calm hit man exacting his revenge. Michael Nyqvist did quite well in portraying a balance of all the aspects of Viggo's character; the ruthlessness and also the cowardice. Having Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo also did the movie a great favor, although I think that they deserve even more significant parts.<br/><br/>John Wick (2014) really deserves an 8 out of 10 score for me. A recommendation is definitely a yes. Although without any unique thing to offer in the story department, this movie can sure make up for it at the action side, and making the early irony something fun to watch."

","'JOHN WICK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Shoot-'em-up action flick starring Keanu Reeves as an ex-hit-man who comes out of retirement to avenge his dead dog. It was directed by first time feature filmmakers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (former stuntmen and fight coordinators) and written by Derek Kolstad. The film also stars Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe. It's a pretty cool and stylized action flick that's also a great comeback for Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>Reeves plays John Wick; a former hit-man who retired when his wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), became deathly ill with cancer. As he's grieving he receives a posthumous gift from her, in the form of a puppy named Daisy. It's explained, through a letter from Helen, that she wanted John to have the dog to help him cope with her passing. John quickly becomes attached to Daisy; so when Russian gang members break into his house and kill the dog, as well as steal his '69 Mustang, John decides to come out of retirement to get revenge. Nyqvist plays the father of one of the gang members, as well as John's former employer.<br/><br/>John Wick is about as much of a badass action hero character as I've seen in a film and Reeves is great in the role. I think Reeves has gotten much better, as an actor, overtime; probably especially because his career took a pretty big downward turn recently. It's great to see him back in action and cooler than ever. I think filmmakers will do a lot more with this character as well, he's already a part of the video game 'Payday 2', and a film franchise seems very likely. The movie is also a great showcase for Leitch and Stahelski, as directors, and I can't wait to see more from them too.

","This is a great action movie. People are saying the script is sub par, but tell me a true action movie that has a stellar script. The lack of dialog goes along with a lack of back story. John Wick is the ""Boogeyman"" and no one knows a lot of information about the ""boogeyman"". The lack of back story (which hopefully may come out in a sequel)lets your mind run a little wild. Mr. Wick was tasked to commit an impossible assassination to get out of the assassin's lifestyle. You never learn what or how they were completed, but you learn John Wick is an indomitable man and completes his task with a force of sheer will. If you want a move thick on dialog and low on action rent ""The Notebook"".<br/><br/>People complain he never misses but 90% of the time he shoots someone in the head they are laying on the ground or holding a wounded limb. I think this is acceptable. He is a seasoned hit man, but I know from experience that accuracy with a firearm is a tarnish-able skill. If he had not fired a gun in five years he would have a little bit of a relearning curve.<br/><br/>Overall a great movie that I will own and will take its place beside the first ""Matrix"" movie."

","OK, I'm biased. I'm big on Keanu. No homo. But j/king aside, John Wick is the movie that proves Reeves is still in the game. Ironically, the titular character is doing just what it's titular leading actor is supposedly doing; coming back and staying current. You only have to watch the movie 15 minutes to catch the tongue in cheek remarks thrown out ad nauseam to this.<br/><br/>Keanu is all over this movie. I don't know how he manages to stay in-shape after 50; it's clearly himself doing most of the stunt work. He might just have the fountain of youth shoved somewhere in his body. (He is The One after all...) It's still good ol' stone face Keanu. Not as hammy as Keanu from Constantine, or as cold as Keanu from DtESS, but somewhere in between. The guy is all about subtlety and jest. He is forward, without being forward. I like it.<br/><br/>Willem *ucking Dafoe!!! Is there any role this cat cannot play?! Seriously, you had me at Dafoe. I think Dafoe is competing with Freeman and Jackson for most utilized supporting actor in Hollywood. He's NEVER a main, always some BAMF supporting cast member. And as always, he's just too good not to love. Even in Fault in Our Stars, he was a lovable crass cynic, but in this movie, he's one of the characters who you just know is a true badass. Keanu ALWAYS picks characters who are loners, yet somehow attracts the guardian angel types, or people who just want him to win. This time around, Dafoe is Wick's guardian angel.<br/><br/>Alfie Allen and Michael Nyqvist are the true breakout actors in this film. Allen, as we all know from Game of Thrones, is easy to hate, but hard to love. He plays this role much as he does in GoT by being the prick mob boss's spoiled brat son who has a penchant for not thinking two seconds ahead. And the mob boss, Nyqvist, is probably the best representation of a smarmy yet sophisticated Russian Don since... well he's probably the first really well adapted Russian mob boss we've ever seen! Jack Reacher went up against the Russian's, and I know there's some in Person of Interest, but Nyqvist's Viggo Tarasov has the swagger, brains, and even compassion to stay fresh and noteworthy, well after the film's ended. He's even got this breadth about him, a foreboding barrel chested strength that you don't see a lot of these days, good casting choice! Both actors played their respective wells true to form.<br/><br/>I'd like to say more about other actors/characters in the movie, but it would honestly contain spoilers. You don't have to even watch the trailer to find out that this is a straight shoot 'em up, true to the core. The freaking dog dies, how much you wanna bet others will too...<br/><br/>Read other reviews if you want to find out about plots, subplots and pacing. John Wick stays fresh and thrilling the entire way through! The stunt work's amazing, the acting is slightly campy yet engaging, the premise is simple, and the movie's a blast!"
"aharmas","10","8","22","26 October 2014"," Action: Plain and Simple
","This is a welcome surprise. Who would have thought Keanu could play such a cool character with that much conviction? He does a perfect job here, displaying the right attitude and making sure every shot hits its target. It's all very simple. He's a grieving widower, and one arrogant and spoiled jerk comes and messes with him. By doing so, Wick is forced out of retirement because someone has decided to ruin his late wife's legacy.<br/><br/>It might look like a silly vendetta to a few, but this is the type of film where there's not much need for emotional speeches and long flashbacks. It's pretty much understood this man is capable of delivering the goods while working, but he appreciated what an alternate lifestyle offered and regrets losing it. Spending a few years in retirement hasn't dulled his skills. As he hunts his prey, we see his exchanges with a few of the people in his previous world, and it's obvious that he occupied a special place there. He commands respect and is well liked/respected. He knows how to follow the rules, express his gratitude to those who help him, and ironically, he is well, a good guy in the middle of this netherworld.<br/><br/>After the break-in in Wick's house, it becomes clear, he won't stop until he gets what he wants. In a perfectly cast part, we enjoy every step he takes seeking retribution. Yes, there's plenty of violence, but it's o.k. to see the good guy get even. He's not immortal or invulnerable. He gets pretty beat up a couple of times, but courtesy of a clever script, he manages to pull through, with the help of a couple of friends, and a very interesting deal near the end.<br/><br/>It appears all is properly resolved by the end, buy we can only hope there's more of this quiet hero in the future. This has been a good year for this type of characters, and I'm surprised audiences have not quite responded. They're the ones missing on the some of the best thrillers of the year. Just go in, don't think too much, and enjoy."

Of course you shouldn't expect some deep thought provoking movie. This is action. It's like an action movie from the 80s or 90s - done better than any of them.<br/><br/>Some things are done so amazing that I think are likely attributed to David Leitch and/or Chad Stahelski. Perhaps it's their stunt background that's really made them understand how these fights should look, and how people actually handle injury and gunshots that's severely lacking in most movies. There is no people taking a shot to the chest, flying back 50 feet, and croaking. There are not people standing around taking their turns on John Wick. Nope, people are double taped. Everyone is finished off with a shot to the heart or chest. John Wick is taking on multiple people at a time with them attacking him like you'd expect. This may offend some, but I'd say this movie makes even legendary movies like Ip Man look BAD. Yet, at the same time, John Wick seems completely human, as he should. There is this perfect balance of him just appearing to be the really good assassin that he is, without seeming to have super powers.<br/><br/>The only reason it's not a 10/10 are a few shortcomings: Michael Nyqvist's acting falls short on occasion, in my opinion (and yes, Keanu's acting in this moving is actually really fantastic). I find it a little odd that John Wick isn't more often looking back over his shoulder to make sure there isn't something there(but the choreography gets more right than just about any movie I've seen). The skip-to-end opening scene that so many movies do now days is also here. Sometimes those are good, but in this case it was really pointless. The exposition goes by great, and they really should have gotten right to that and skipped that."

After watching the movie I had to check who director and writter are, well, why wasn't I surprised. Director Chad Stahelski came from a kick-boxing background; he entered the film field as a stunt performer. I believe that's why movie was nominated for ""Best Stunts"", and unfairly won ""Best Action Movie"" award. You remember how fake the the fight scenes in ""Iron Fist"" series were? Well, Keanu Reeves is even worse. Writer Derek Kolstad's IQ is below average, dry and stupid dialogues ruined the whole movie. Towards the end of the movie Keanu Reeves kills dozens of gangster and survives, but at the beginning of movie 3 gangsters came in his house in the night and beat the s**t out of him, kills his puppy and still his car.

","Generally, I'm very cautious about watching action movies because of their predictability and the 'you-know-the-end-before-it-even-ended' syndrome and for sure John Wick didn't deceive in that aspect. This is one of the reasons why I would generally pick films that would be the least predictable as possible since anyways this is inevitable.<br/><br/>While to me the overall story actually made some sense even though you could actually tell what the ending would look like halfway through, the general feeling that you get at the end when you've watched everything and been left to your own self and where Mr. Wick is as invincible as it gets killing people without ever getting touched -; I mean certain scenes really do not make no sense whatsoever, especially the one with the car where there are like 10 dudes shooting with automatic weapons and Mr. Wick would be gliding around gracefully without taking a single bullet. I mean this was really pushed way too far in terms of trying to have the spectator believe in this guy's supernatural abilities as a simple human being or whatever they were trying to do.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me a lot of 'Walker Texas Ranger' which was also a complete joke of a series.<br/><br/>I know this is a movie and that it doesn't necessarily need to represent reality but this 'invincibility' thing knowing that Wick wasn't initially introduced as some sort of superhuman really doesn't make any sense. There's a huge gap between Mr. Wick being a simple human and invincibility that the movie crossed which is hardly justifiable from a rational standpoint."
"ginocox-206-336968","9","7","19","15 January 2015"," John Wick easily trounces The Equalizer
","""John Wick"" has a lot in common with ""The Equalizer"" (2013). Both feature a former highly skilled assassin who has retired to live in quiet solitude but who is compelled to use his deadly skills again when a Russian mobster commits a despicable act of violence. Denzel Washington is generally considered the better actor and brings a sense of gravitas to his role. However, Keanu Reeves brings more a sense of melancholy and reluctance to his role, which was sadly lacking in TE. Washington looks bigger, stronger and more physically imposing, but never displays any particular skill at martial arts. The fights in TE are shot in semi-darkness and edited with a lot of quick cuts, so Washington's character never seems truly credible as the tough fighter he is supposed to be. In contrast, the fight scenes in JW are masterfully choreographed. One can not only see, but follow the action. Reeves comes across as a much more credible action hero, skilled with guns, knives and his bare hands. The Russian mobsters are much more menacing, evil and capable in TE than in JW, where they are adequate, but less memorable. These gangsters are three-dimensional characters with flaws, foibles and idiosyncrasies that make them more realistic and even a little likable. They also have conflicting agendas, whereas the gangsters in TE are more narrowly focused and unwavering. JW also has a much better production design. The color palate, costumes and cinematography blow TE away. Neither film is perfect. JW starts off a bit slowly attempting to bolster motivations that don't need bolstering. But once it begins, maintains a steady action pace. Between the two, JW is much more enjoyable and Reeves is a better action hero than Washington. JW doesn't have quite the panache or complexity of ""Django Unchained,"" ""Rock 'n' Rolla,"" ""Smokin' Aces"" or the underrated ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" but it's a solid effort by all involved."

The acting is okay but when the action starts you don't care about this anymore. Most of the action scenes are really cool and some of the gun fighting scenes are just awesome! For a Hollywood movie its actually quite realistic, you can see Keanu's training for The Matrix is still in his muscles. The main plot is not that special but some side plots are really nice. Humor was a big part of the movie much to my surprise, the entire room was laughing quite a few times.<br/><br/>For a one-guy-kills-all-the-bad-guys movie this was really good and that's why I'm rating it 7/10."

"davideo-2","4","4","9","16 March 2016"," Unremarakble, DVD bargain bin standard action flick
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>After the tragic death of his wife, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is given a dog as a parting gift from her, in order that he won't return to his former life of violence and mayhem. However, a run in with gangster's son Iosef (Alfie Allen) results in his home being invaded, and his pet being brutally murdered. This sets the fire raging in John's heart again, and before long, he returns to the streets to enact brutal revenge. However, Iosef's father is Viggo (Michael Nvquist), a Russian mob boss and his former employer.<br/><br/>It's remarkable that, while far better actors have descended into a DVD bargain bin hellhole from which there seems no return, Keanu Reeves would still appear to have the star power to headline a Hollywood action film. He could be comfortably settled into that world quite nicely now, but here he is in this fairly well received action film. Quite hard to fathom why, really, when what we have is a fairly standard, join the dots piece of work, with unexciting action scenes that are too sped up and hyper kinetic to make any impact.<br/><br/>While Reeves broods, and does the action hero typeset that he's so suited to, singer Lily Allen's brother Alfie appears as the despicable young villain, and the likes of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo are drafted in as support. Its appeal seemingly lies in its simplicity, with what seems to be a deliberately straightforward, uncomplicated plot that takes you from A to B pretty easily. It does this pretty competently, but rather than be an admirably simple bit of fun, it's just a piecemeal, ineffective affair that washes over you like rain. **"
"Horst_In_Translation","8","4","9","27 February 2016"," The man who kills the Boogeyman
","There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad's script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.<br/><br/>I was very pleased with Reeves performance here. He is a man in his 50s now and I guess with age came a certain masculinity that works very well in this film here. Willem Dafoe is fun as always. Adrianne Palicki nicely plays a cold-blooded femme fatale. Lance Redick is a lot of fun with his professional take on Wick being a guest in his hotel. Alfie Allen is the real antagonist at times, but his character's age and and inexperience really cost him that perspective. Instead his character's father develops into the main enemy to John Wick, even if both apparently still have a lot of respect for the other and Nyqvist's character really only has to pay for his offspring's sins and Wick seems to understand that he wants to protect his son, even if he opposes this idea. People who complain that such a way of revenge may be way too much for a dead dog and stolen car have not understand a thing about the main character here. He is a testosterone-filled hit man, who has not acted rationally for years and will not do so either if somebody destroys the only link left between him and his beloved wife. That's why it is not an unrealistic film. I also liked that they did not choose to include a new love interest for the main character as it would have been really contradictory in terms of him mourning for his wife. They can do that in the sequel perhaps. Choosing the path of an assassin to avoid a 99% male cast was the right way to go.<br/><br/>There are a couple moments that did not seem in a way that I'd have expected from Wick, usually these when he shows mercy for his greatest enemies, also the scene in the end. Yes he does respect Tarasov Sr. but after killing Dafoe's character is it really appropriate that he threw his gun away? I am not sure about that. I guess I'd have preferred an ending like the final boss battle from ""Taken"". And the dog scene at the end? Oh well, this is maybe one of the few areas when the film attempts to be something more than it should with the emotional significance that felt really only included for the sake of it. But there really isn't anything wrong with these 100 minutes. I enjoyed the watch a lot and this is even more impressive as action films can rarely stay memorable to me. Highly recommended, an extremely positive surprise how well it worked against all odds. I very much hope the second one will be equally strong."
"petra_ste","7","4","9","3 September 2015"," Keanu's dog day
","Although I will never forgive Keanu Reeves for ruining Coppola's Dracula with a legendary terrible performance, he is not an inherently bad actor. Like a well-honed tool , Keanu is fine if put in the right place; if misplaced (say, as a 19th century upper-class Englishman), he is disastrous. <br/><br/>Here Keanu is ideally cast as titular assassin John Wick; the part exploits his wiry physicality and doesn't stretch his limited range, requiring him to project deadly efficiency as he slaughters Russian mobsters who killed his dog. The latter may sound stupid but it's actually the smartest decision in the movie, as it places the story firmly in comic book territory, which fits the hyper-stylized violence seen here. <br/><br/>The script also features a few clever touches, like golden coins used as currency for special services in the criminal underworld (such as corpse disposal) or a hotel known as a truce zone for killers; again, an appropriate comic book feel.<br/><br/>Director Stahelski uses his experience as stunt coordinator to craft energetic set-pieces, peaking in Wick's attack to an underground pool. There is a great moment when the camera pans laterally showing the silhouette of a mobster shot against a blue panel, then follows another thug until Wick takes him down, all while the music throbs in the background.<br/><br/>The cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Adrianne Palicki and Michael Nyqvist; the latter steals the movie with a combination of sharp malevolence and detached sense of humor, like when he recalls Wick killing three men with a pencil then walks next to one of his henchmen and casually mimics a stab at his throat.<br/><br/>As far as revenge/power fantasies go, this one at least is competently made.<br/><br/>6,5/10"

"kieranbattams","8","4","9","12 April 2015"," this is what action films long to be...
","Retired hit-man? Check. Actor who has lost his way with the public after a successful franchise? Check. Fun, entertaining and utterly badass? Double check. Don't let the trailers fool you into thinking this is in the vein of the bad slew of action films we have had recently with actors like Arnie, Sly Stallone and Liam Neeson trying to get back on form, John Wick actually succeeds in being everything it wants to be and everything its audience wants.. and Keanu Reeves kicks serious ass as the title character. Word of advice.. do not mess with John Wick.<br/><br/>The plot follows John after the tragic death of his wife who leaves him a puppy as a last gift to help him cope with the loss and to make sure he isn't alone. When Russian mobsters try to buy his vintage car and he refuses they get mad and decide to kill his dog. This sets John off on a revenge rampage and brings him out of retirement to take out everyone who took everything from him. As a dog lover this was hard to watch, but seeing Keanu Reeves mow down rows of mobsters will never get old. This film could have easily been like other action films today with a mediocre plot stretched over 2 hours expecting to be loved. It knows what it is from the get go and after a slightly slow opening we are given a treat for action fans and a real guys film (not that women cant also enjoy this). Aside from Keanu Reeves, Willem Defoe is in this film. Recently it feels like Willem Defoe is still being used to throw in to minor roles in films for the sake of it.. but for him it works, so props for that. We recently saw him in both ""The Fault in our Stars"" and ""The Grand Budapest hotel"" but in both films whilst he could have been played by almost anyone.. he was significant and great like he was in John Wick. At first he almost felt like Jason Statham in Furious 7, popping up when he was needed to be a threat to the main character (which isn't such a bad thing) but he becomes more than this which was cool to see.<br/><br/>But the show is very much Keanu Reeves own and he knows this. The dialogue was delivered well from him and whereas he was a badass in The Matrix.. in this film he was a million notches above Neo. Every action scene felt like a video game in the best way. The nightclub scene was particularly pulse- pounding and made me feel right in the moment. It is guaranteed that any scene featuring John Wick and a room full of bad guys is going to be beautifully stylised and absolutely absurd. I can see this being a nice, small franchise which could work way better than something like Taken and it would be cool to see John's back-story unravelled. In the end i enjoyed this movie a hell of a lot and for any fan of action movies this is a must see. Keanu has never been better.. Just never mess with his life. If he is anything like John Wick then i feel sorry for anyone that attempts it."
"nytehiker1","8","4","9","11 April 2015"," A Very Refreshing Role To See Reeves In
","Never wrote a review before but felt to on this for a specific reason. Keanu Reeves....I swear everything I see him in, while most of the movies I enjoy, his characters in them I usually don't...they all seem to come from the same type of mold...all rather coldish in some aspect, dryish stale, not saying he's a bad actor, he just seems to always be the same person in everything...maybe it's just me. This is why up until this movie, my favorite character of his was always Ted in the Bill & Ted movies cause he is so different from the other characters he's played. <br/><br/>Firstly, this is one heck of an action movie, I kept finding myself sad whenever I thought it was just about to end, just to have another action packed scene come in instead and be joyous again..lol. The soundtrack is Epic (for me anyways...I'm a musician with a similar style so it really stood out for me.)<br/><br/>Reeve's character though....reminded me a little somewhat of him in Constantine...only in that in both he's a bit hard/cold good/bad guy, but in a totally different way in each of them...I don't know if it's just his unshaven, badass look in this movie, or his acting, but I didn't feel like, ""Oh, this is just Keanu Reeves again,"" and more like, ""This is John Wick."" Meaning the character itself stood out so much more, if that makes sense. May sound silly to some. I also love the way how he's so precise in his movements when going after people. I so wish I had gotten to see this in the theater. <br/><br/>Sure there may not be a whole lot to the story, it's simple and whatnot, but for the person going into this wanting pure action such, this is perfect. <br/><br/>I heard a lot of bad reviews stating ""oh this has been done over and over, it's old, nothing new, seen it before, blah blah blah."" But...take 3 movies, all very high grossing...Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai, and Avatar....all 3 have a similar premise which is mostly why haters of Avatar disliked it...said it was too much like Dances With Wolves....I kinda thought The Last Samurai fit that premise too, but love that movie nevertheless and unless I just haven't heard it or something, I've never heard people dis The Last Samurai like that...meaning I think people went into Avatar expecting something like even more complex, bigger, different in whatever way they were hoping for....I think the same happens here with John Wick...even though it has a good rating, all the bad things I hear about it are almost all the same."

","10 April 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - John Wick. If you are not a fan of gratuitous violence, blood and gore.....stop now, this film is not for you. However if you are a fan of the action/thriller genre with all of the above included the. I thoroughly recommend this film. Keanu Reeves has definitely matured, this film, although a little wandering at the beginning, was gripping stuff. Reeves plays John Wick, a professional hit-man who fell in love and retired. When everything is taken away from him he looks for revenge and with his reputation definitely preceding him, he systematically exacts revenge from those who must pay. This was set in New York, a city beautifully shot from above, at night, looking straight down. Wick's world is one with rules of it's own, and you just accept this story without wondering why the good citizens of New York are not getting their knickers in a twist about the bodies and car wrecks piling up. Elegantly written, these people simply do not exist and the story continues on regardless. It wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realised that the film was produced in part by Eva Longoria (of Desperate Housewives fame). Not everybody's cup of tea but I'd definitely raise another Earl Grey."
"CrisMovieCorner","10","4","9","9 April 2015"," ""Actions speak louder than words!""
","Another woefully misunderstood film, I've seen many reviews attacking this film, what did you expect from a Keanu Reeves driven Action film? A Robert De Niro acted, Oscar worthy film? Get the heck out of here, you can NOT judge all films based on the same factors, it is the equivalent of comparing say Godfather Part II and A Nightmare On Elm Street, both incredible films in their genre but holding them up against the Academy standards A Nightmare On Elm Street would be instantly brushed aside. Which is something that really irks me, I bet I could drive the Academy driven critics insane to say Birdman was a -100/10 if I were to hold it to the same standards as A Nightmare On Elm Street, because that rating would be perfectly acceptable in comparison, it is just highly unfair to compare films that are so different in their target audience and the aim of the film.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Chad Stahleski and David Leitch who are widely known for their stunt work, or at least they should be known for it, their collective filmography includes the likes of The Matrix, The Crow, S.W.A.T and Van Helsing, so to say they are well versed in the world of stunts and action is an understatement. So the choice to have them direct the widely coveted script by Derek Kolstad makes perfect sense, at its core ""John Wick"" a revenge film that is brutal and doesn't mess around at all. Hard to believe that this is the directorial debut of both Stahleski and Leitch, their work comes across as truly experienced directors within the given genre. After this film I can see them going very far in the action world, easy to see why they were given a John Wick 2 and are being touted for an upcoming DCCU film.<br/><br/>The film starts out with Wick losing his wife to some sort of illness (details never given to the audience, not needed at all), he inherits a Beagle puppy from his late to help cope with her passing. He quickly falls in love with the pup, spending all his time with her and his '69 Mustang. The Mustang which catches the eye of a young member of the Russian mafia, who tries to persuade him to sell the car. Iosef (Alfie Allen) not accepting of Wicks decision to completely shoot down any sale decides to take the car. Iosef and his ""gang"" break into the house to rob the car, beat Wick to within an inch of his life and more disturbing of all kill his dog. These events reactive Wick into his previous life he left behind as a mafia hit-man, so now Wick is set to destroy any members that get in his way of an organisation of which he was once an employee.<br/><br/>This is the film that came bring Reeves back from some of his recent performances which I highly recommend you stay away from the likes of ""Henry's Crime"", ""47 Ronin"" and ""Generation Um"" come to mind. However, this time around Keanu gave a solid performance as the films titular character, Keanu done everything right to portray which emotions he needed, plus his background in martial arts really blended well with the directors choice to use ""gun-fu"" which if you are not familiar with, once you watch this you will understand perfectly the phrasing. It was not just Reeves who gave a great performance, other performances shone too from the likes of Michael Nyqvist, Lance Reddick, Paul McShane and the ever enjoyable Adrianne Palicki. It was a genius idea to give Reeves less to say and allow him to use his actions instead of words, what is the old idiom ""Actions speak louder than words"" it's like that was made for Mr John Wick himself.<br/><br/>The film does not mess around, it gets straight to the point storywise and characterwise, we're straight into the action within the first 15-20 minutes. Which may feel like it will have adverse effects on the pacing of the film, which at the time was a bit of a worry of mine also. Safe to say my reservations were unwarranted, the film ran at a wonderful pace, with Wick moving quickly onto his next henchman to take on in brutally beautiful manors each time. Resulting in a truly wonderful 100 minutes to behold for any Action/Thriller/Martial Arts fan of any age.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was a spectacle in its given genres, edge of the seat Action for 101 minutes be it from Reeves kicking ass or him getting his ass kicked. There is one thing I absolutely LOVED about this film, which was the directors choice to have Wick, once he beat a villain, was to put one/two rounds into their heart/head to make sure they were dead. Seems like something every hit-man should do, it just really stood out in this film for me. This film was an incredible watch full of Action and a decent story, which slightly predictable, heck what Action film isn't. I really couldn't recommend this film any higher to fans of the genre or Reeves, if you're a fan of neither, I think this will change your view on either one."

","Keanu Reeves has not offered the cinematic world much since The Matrix trilogy. Can John Wick reignite his impact? <br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... John Wick has had a positive buzz, but is it enough to get people to the theatres? The appeal is seeing Keanu back in his wheel house. Films with short bits of dialogue, subtle humour and a multitude of action. Not since Point Break has Reeves had a role that looked so right for him. <br/><br/>Overall rating: 3 stars Cinematic value: 3.75 stars Family value: 1.5 stars<br/><br/>'Fortune favours the brave' English translation of John Wick's tattoo<br/><br/>'Do not mess with a man's dog' is basic knowledge in film class 101. From Old Yeller to Turner & Hooch, the dog serves as the catalyst for some of the key events in film history. John Wick is no different. Wick's last gift from his recently deceased wife is a puppy named Daisy. She serves as a connection to his wife and as comfort during his grief. Through a chance encounter with the Russian mafia, he is robbed and without spoiling too much of the story, they mess with the dog. Which unleashes a tale of revenge and a horrific day at the office for the men who robbed John Wick. Call it arrogance or naivety, these thieves robbed the wrong guy. Wick only recently retired from being a hit-man. Wick was not just any assassin, but The Bogeyman, feared by the mere mention of his name. The thieves cause the emotional tipping point for him to unleash his revenge on the dark criminal underworld. The story takes Wick on a hunt for the men who 'took away his opportunity to grieve' and through the process, his past is revealed and the audience is introduced to the hit-man's hidden world. His target through most of the film is Iosef Tarasov played by Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones), who seems to have perfected the pathetic, elder son role in television and on the big screen. The unsympathetic character of Iosef seems to warrant the inevitable vigilante justice from his introductory scene. As with most revenge films, the believability of survival of the main character goes beyond comprehension, but it is an undeniable, guilty pleasure to experience. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves (Matrix) is the champion for the average man. He never comes off as too smart or fit, but is at his best with little dialogue and multiple points of action. This film happens fast and is over before you can consider the sheer lunacy of the concept. The debutant directorial team of David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, give Reeves the perfect storyline to capitalise on his strengths. Like all of the action in this film, they seem to understand that the best lines come quick, subtle and hit their mark. John Wick is a simple story of revenge shot against a dark, criminal landscape, but moves beyond the cliché. Do not misunderstand, this film is exceptionally violent, but the actions of Reeves are projected thorough the film with a force that is fuelled by well drawn supporting characters. Michael Nyqvist, Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe manage well orchestrated dialogue and fill in the necessary back story to quicken the pace of the film. They allow Reeves to be the action lead and he is only required to deliver memorable one liners. The quick linguistic delivery adds the needed levity for the audience to catch their breath. <br/><br/>The film deserves its rating due to violence and language, but it does open the door to many conversation points. John Wick wrestles with the love and loss of his wife. Opening a door into the raw emotion that occurs in the life of a spouse that grieves. The loneliness, love and anger spins together into a mix that is not healthy in this film, but warrants consideration and discussion. Should people be given allowance during a time of trauma of the magnitude? The other significant plot point that should be considered is 'The Code.' When the movie moves to The Continental Hotel, things get interesting. This is a world where hit men and women go for a place of neutrality. Winston (Ian McShane) is the owner and stresses the code that underpins this violent world. Only those within the system seem to know the code and understand the penalties for breaking it, but the bigger question is who is the one who determines the code and how should justice be enacted? John Wick is merely another revenge film, but even the simplest of stories can open the door for the bigger questions of life and could even fuel conversation for those who regularly attend these films. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... This is a simple, but well made film. Cinematic simplicity is a fine line. The creators of the film have to determine what to add or take away for the effectiveness of a film. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, but with John Wick it works. This was the right film to capitalise on Keanu Reeves strengths and was a fresh telling of a well worn story line. <br/><br/>If you remember anything, don't mess with the dog!<br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is revenge the answer to injustice? (Psalm 37: 27-29, Romans 12:17-21) 2. What is biblical justice? (Psalm 7:9, Romans 3:5-6) 3. Who determines right and wrong? (John 3:19-21, Matthew 28:18)<br/><br/>Please study the rating before going to see this film. <br/><br/>Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews"

Every negative point he lists is very true, besides his first one with the russian accent, I didn't really care about that one. There was barely a scene where I did not shake my head and shrug, because the writing was just SO illogical.<br/><br/>
I can take a movie where's a lot of shooting and action, I love that. But if the plot has so many holes that you wouldn't even need guns to shoot some, that is the worst sign.

In the whole movie just his dressing was awesome. Believe me that in the whole movie I was expecting that now , now he will do something amazing but nope...

","John Wick is a groundbreaking film in the action genre.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves, star of such noted actioners as Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Something's Gotta Give, and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, plays the titular character. Wick is a retired hit-man whose wife has recently died. He is given a puppy as a condolence and quickly bonds with the dog, who becomes a frequent passenger in Wick's 1969 Mustang. Tragedy strikes, however, when a group of thugs break into Wick's house and kill the dog after robbing him of his beloved Ford. When I say tragedy strikes, I mean it strikes the thugs. John Wick isn't merely a hit-man; he's a well-trained one. After hooking up with some old (and new) allies from the underworld, Wick sets out to avenge the death of his dog. But he quickly finds that the leader of the gang which attacked him is the spoiled son of a Russian mob boss. Upon hearing this, Wick decides his quest for vengeance will be too risky, and the film ends as he settles down into a quiet life with a new kitten.<br/><br/>Actually, just kidding. Wick embarks on a mad hunt for his dog's killer. In his effort to exact revenge for the killing of his dog, he fells at least a hundred enemies in combat. In a crackling showdown, Wick wordlessly shoots the unarmed kid before walking away wordlessly. Figuring the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, Wick pursues the old man and brilliantly fools the gangster into stabbing him. Being that the old man is a hardened Russian gangster, he freezes up after stabbing Wick, giving Reeves a chance to turn the tables after killing a dozen of his henchmen. He gets another dog and everyone is happy.<br/><br/>John Wick is a groundbreaking film in that it eschews the niceties of most modern films, like plot and character. Like a race car stripped of amenities, it jumps straight into the action and never lets up. The scene in which Wick shoots a mob henchman in the head was a standout. The scene in which Wick shoots a mob henchman in the chest was also notably exciting. The scene in which Wick shoots three mob henchmen in the head, chest, and groin was particularly riproaring. One advantage of John Wick is that its action sequences are kept simple and sweet. Films with complex action tend to be boring because they are rather hard to follow. Dialogue is also wisely kept to a minimum. A well-endowed young female assassin is also a clever choice, who also thankfully speaks as little as possible.<br/><br/>Watching John Wick, I was reminded of a much inferior, older film called Die Hard. Wick works for the same reasons Die Hard doesn't. Most of Die Hard revolved around Bruce Willis crawling through air ducts, complaining about his wife, and discussing Westerns over the radio with an overweight police officer. When the action mercifully does occur, it's often burdened by confusing stunts and unnecessary editing. Die Hard is widely regarded as a failure due to its reliance on dialogue and contrived, overly-emotional characters. I saw the film recently on Lifetime with my mother. She was crying when Willis had to drag his feet through broken glass. I, on the other hand, thought it was the most satisfying moment in the entire film. Willis' character (and possibly the actor himself for signing on to this crap) deserved a little bloodletting after spending so much of the movie weeping and failing to kill significant numbers of terrorists. John Wick, on the other hand, would have dispatched the effeminate European terrorists by slapping them and chasing them away. He also would have cheated on his annoying wife with a well-endowed young female assassin—er, secretary. Hopefully we'll be able to see this in the sequel, which was just released recently."

","For people who just heard or seen the photos of Keanu Reeves from this movie and thought yeah this maybe is a good flick. And then reading about it about being the most underrated movie of the year and so on. Yeah I was one of those. <br/><br/>And it was kinda a letdown actually. I don't think I hyped it too much but it just seemed like a good action movie and The letdown is hands down the story. But not bad writing, it's more how they presented it in the movie. Strange way on how they did it and it is very clear they just tried to jam it in as fast as they could so they could do brainless action all the way. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves acting , there's nothing wrong with it. I loved that part but everything else with the movie was just a snore. <br/><br/>I mean this thing that have been way overplayed about showed the end first and then go back to the beginning. Don't you just hate that? It was cool the first time but now you see it all the time in TV shows and movies and even video games and yes I think I am not alone when I say; Just stop. Just stop. <br/><br/>This movie is enjoyable yes. But The beginning was so slow I almost turned it off and said to myself; Oh well another movie that didn't lived up to what I expected, sigh. <br/><br/>Good things with the movie: <br/><br/>+ Keanu Reeves<br/><br/>+ Willem Dafoe <br/><br/>+ The fighting scenes (with guns)<br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/><ul><li>The story</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The focus on brainless Hollywood action instead of a good story</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Stupid bad guys (obviously stupid, even more stupid than an old Arnold movie)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The slow start</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The reason for this movie </li></ul><br/><br/>And the last one 'reason for this movie' it's painfully obvious this movie was made to do a brainless action movie because that is what it became when they just tossed away the story for action. Sure it is very done well (the gun scenes) but I want some real story and some story I can think about after seeing this but nope. Frankly I don't even know why anyone would think about this movie more than 3 seconds afterwards and thinking... that was dumb huh?"

","I read a Todd Solondz quote once (yeah, weird way to start a review for John Wick but stick with me, folks), where he was talking about his movie Happiness and how it's actually quite simple to gain sympathy from an audience, and he talked about how the writer can just give a character cancer and everyone will feel sorry for that person and if you make someone a victim (and he/she's not right off the bat the villain or something) then there's identification right away. At the start of this movie we don't know who this man John Wick exactly is or what he does or how he can afford such a good house and car, but we do know that he has just lost his wife to some sickness and that she left him as a parting gift a dog so that he could move on with his life. And not any old dog or some mangy thing from the vet, but the cutest goddamn puppy that you could ever lay your eyes on. Needless to say things look good... until Wick happens to stop at a gas station, a Russian s***-head talks some crap (good ol' 'Reek' from Game of Thrones Alfie Allen, who is another good s***-head here), then that night the mobsters come to his house, trash it, beat him up and, worst of all, kill the dog.<br/><br/>The writers go for a premise that's fairly easy and borderline lazy; of course we want to see Wick get the payback on these guys - even as they were once his former employers and ironically, in order to really retire, he had to pull a number that set up the Russian mobster's empire in cozy terms - because they killed the pretty-witty-wicky dog! As the Dude would say in Big Lebowski, this aggression will not stand! What ensues from here is a whole lot of violence and carnage, peppered with a whole lot of good character actors and awesome people - Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Dean Winters, Adrienne Palikci, Lance Reddick (remember him from The Wire and Oz?) - and that's about it. In that way it's admirable as a kind of meat-n-potatoes flick for the guys (and maybe some girls out there too): watch Keanu Reeves kill a LOT of people. <br/><br/>But there are two things that I didn't expect out of what is basically a gigantic action kill-fest that is a time-waster: 1) the fight and stunt choreography, and how the director and cameraman and editor get it all together, works with some tight and efficient work while also being complex at the same time. You can tell where everyone is in relation to one another whether it's Keanu and a dozen guys on a club floor, or just him and Palicki getting dirty (not *that* dirty, the fighting kind) in a hotel room, or three cars in a high speed chase. It's not chaotic but it is intense work and I got more drawn in to it than I expected.<br/><br/>The 2) is that there's a whole lot of good background to this world that Wick is in. What I mean is that it almost resembles something out of a comic book (for adults) in a good way: it's like there's this whole set up functionality for someone like Wick to work in, to the point of almost (or simply being) satirical. I had a big laugh at one moment when a cop (just one) comes to Wick's place after he guns down a whole bunch of guys at night, they know each other apparently and he sees a dead guy on the floor behind him, and he just gives him a 'have a good night' and walks away. Then the cleaning crew comes (what do they do when they're *not* cleaning up, or maybe there's always work to be done as far as disposing of bodies in this New York), and then there's the hotel that Wick stays at while he looks for Josef, and it's run like a hotel *for* the criminal element, as if they are always expecting guys with guns to be in their midst and only as that, maybe, they keep it down a little.<br/><br/>This is a heightened reality as opposed to something fully realistic, but this added to my pleasure watching the movie. I wanted to see a whole movie set in this world that McShane's character seems to run - like some old film-noir he sits in a jazz club (lit very prettily, this is a colorful movie for big chunks) - and that Reddick is the concierge I suppose. The problem though is that underneath all of this style and potential for a much grander experience it's still a shallow action movie. In a way it may work for this kind of material that it's simply ""you stole my car, you killed my dog, and my wife...""; for an audience coming to this, maybe too much ambiguity would muddy the waters. But I wish the filmmakers, who are clever enough to put in the touches of a much larger environment for these criminals (Dafoe has a good if predictable role also as a hit-man by the way), had gone a little further.<br/><br/>As it stands I liked it, though by a certain point - like say in the last twenty minutes - it starts to get into overkill territory. I was still into it for the action and would recommend it simply on those terms. But if you're looking for something challenging as far as engaging/challenging and audience's sympathies, you won't get it. This is all about Reeves punching, kicking, slamming, knifing, blasting, crashing, shooting, choking, and doing everything under the sun, and while he's not Neo here he might as well be."
"anaconda-40658","5","3","6","24 November 2015"," Average Action.
","John Wick (2014): Dir: Chad Stahelski / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Willem Dafoe, Adrienne Palicki: Recycled action farce with that ever familiar scenario where one guy kills dozens of hit men and its tone is one of complete dismay for any message. Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, former hit-man who left that life to settle down with his wife. She is killed during flashbacks. After her funeral a dog is delivered and a card from her lays claim to this being her final gift to him so that he can move on. Problem is that someone takes interest in his car. When he refuses to sell it, they respond by beating him up in the night, killing his dog, and stealing the car. If this nimwitted setup wasn't enough, viewers can predict what happens next. Wick makes a quick recovery and goes on a killing spree that would be the envy of any slasher film villain. Like The Equalizer, we have a hero who can seemingly take on an army, and like that film, these thugs are just targets for violent carnage for the sake of mindless entertainment. Reeves actually fares well as this former hit-man whose past will not allow him to embrace his future. Michael Nyqvist plays the villain, Wick's former boss and whose son committed the sinful act against Wick. Alfie Allen plays Nyqvist's son whose pride overrides intelligence and he soon finds himself fleeing through a nightclub with Wick in pursuit. Willem Dafoe plays a hit-man hired to kill Wick but he actually aids him instead. Adrienne Palicki plays a hitwoman who targets Wick in a hotel room. Directed with skill by Chad Stahelski with a screenplay that sets the tone for retching carnage over meaning. Score: 5 / 10"
"r-kerr0992","7","3","6","12 April 2015"," A fun, self-aware action movie
","SYNOPSIS Retired hit man John Wick forces himself out of retirement to track down and kill gangsters that took away something of unique sentimentality from him.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW I really went into this film with low expectations and thought it would be a schlock inducing mess of mind numbing action and boring dialogue with no emotional draw to the story. It was in a sense, but it was more than that, and feel like at first I was taking it to seriously. Firstly, this movie is a lot of fun. Bar the first ten minutes of the film its a great non-stop action film that delivers on what it can. I thought that concept at first was boring because at least every three months we see some Michael Bay b*******t or just some generic thriller movie we have no interest in seeing. However there was a lot of buzz surrounding this so I thought I gave it a shot.<br/><br/>I think the reason the movie works so well is because the action set pieces are so well done, some of the best I've personally seen in a long time. They're grounded in reality and don't need special effects or loud noises to keep the film flowing, just well executed stunt choreography. II think this is mostly down to the directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski , who've been a stunt coordinators for a majority of their careers (300, V for Vendetta, The Matrix). You take two stunt coordinators who have worked on very stylized movies throughout their time you get that influence rubbing off. That leads me to my next point, even the direction in the slower, dialogue heavy scenes is great. The great lighting down to the strange subtitles gives it a gritty, comic book feel.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCES I feel like their wasn't really stand outs in the movie, everybody did a solid job. If I was to choose Michael Nyqvist as the head antagonist Viggo Tarasov would take the cake, it felt like every scene was in the movie was at its best. Willem Dafoe as hit-man Marcus deserves a mention, specifically the character's final scene with Tarasov. Of course Keanu Reeves did a solid job as the lead, however I do feel you could replace him with any actor and they could have done the job all the same. But it is nice to see Defoe and Reeves re-appearing in a more audience driven blockbuster movie.<br/><br/>NOTEWORTHY MOMENTS The action scenes were incredibly well done, however I do feel one sequence was done so well its the one that got me completely engaged with the film. The nightclub scene was just great, from every perspective. The direction was top-notch with the four levels of the nightclub all having different lighting tones and the non- stop fight choreography blistering through each set. It was performed ideally from both Alfie Allen and Keanu Reeves, as well as all of the stunt cast. It didn't go over the top, and some signature kill moves were highlighted in John Wick's fight style which gave it a sense of authenticity rather than the protagonist turns up and fights people. He has a style and the most effective ways to kill people ad he repeats them several times, it doesn't try to make every death scene spectacular but it packs more of a punch. <br/><br/>I do feel like you could pick any set piece in the movie and say it was your favourite and I could totally understand why. They all are completely different, from a claustrophobic home invasion to a non-stop action maze in a nightclub, to a loud and brash gun fight outside a church, to a car orientated shootout at fishing docks, to an up close and personal one on one fight. Very dynamic, and every scene is different and entertaining.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT This movie is nothing like any Liam Neeson cash grab nonsense thats in the cinema right now. It's a great 100-minute movie that celebrates whats fun about action movies. It's grounded in a non-CGI world filled with somewhat cheesy lines and brilliantly choreographed set pieces. It's self aware, it knows that its not trying to be a well-written Oscar-nominated script, its entertaining with good performances, directed really well, and the stunt choreography is some of the best thats been in a movie for a long time.<br/><br/>If you want to enjoy a movie that you don't need to concentrate when watching but it isn't mind numbingly terrible, this is it."
"Algernop","10","9","27","24 October 2014"," John Wick Doesn't Miss
","Wow. I was excited to see Keanu returning to the modern action genre, and as John Wick, he does not disappoint. Keanu steps out from his usual monotonic delivery and on several occasions in the film, he is given the opportunity to showcase his acting abilities, which for much of his career have lay dormant.<br/><br/>There is more to John Wick than just a standard revenge flick, There is a depth of character and a subtleness in the cinematography that is often missing from such genre films. The action is interlaced regularly with moments of levity, tension, and even sadness. <br/><br/>John Wick is not your typical shoot 'em up action flick. Yes it has a gratuitously high body count, and some of the take-downs are brutal in their efficiency and ruthlessness, yet underneath all the blood and corpses there is a vast undercurrent of emotion and symbolism just waiting to be discovered. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. 4.5 out of 5 Stars"
"sanda_mo-1","10","9","27","23 October 2014"," Intense, fast-paced action movie that does not take itself too seriously
","The key to truly appreciating John Wick lies in knowing what you're getting yourself into when you go to see this movie. I was quite impressed by the group that attended the same screening as I did - everywhere I turned I could hear the same variation of ""oh it's a movie about a guy whose dog gets killed and then he goes to take revenge by killing a lot of people."" Sounds ludicrous I know. That's kind of the whole point though.<br/><br/>John Wick is not a story-driven movie. It is, however, a fun and funny, action-driven cinematic ride. I knew exactly what kind of film I was going to see and I got that and so much more. John Wick is a badass (who also happens to have an impeccable sense of style), does not really say much (part of what makes him such a badass) but knows quite a few ways to get rid of the people he decides to get rid of.<br/><br/>Guns, snipers, knives, things that go boom, fancy cars, a storm of violence interspersed with a few (intentional) laughter inducing moments. It's a movie that does not take itself seriously and does not expect its audience to either. It just gives you pure, unadulterated entertainment. Impressive supportive cast - it took me a while to recognize Michael Nyqvist (a Swedish actor) in a role of a Russian mobster. The parts of the dialogue that are in Russian are translated in an almost cartoonishly stylized manner that makes those scenes resemble a comic book more than a movie (I was half expecting to see text bubbles appearing).<br/><br/>It's a phenomenal B-movie that introduces an interesting view of the criminal underworld - juxtaposing classy and crude, unwritten rules in a manner of ""honor among criminals"" I'd say. It is a ""testosterone in overdrive"" type of movie but one that I believe will appeal to women as well. (if for no other reason than because John Wick is so incredibly cool) I know I'm grateful that I got to see it on a big screen - I think it's the only way to truly immerse yourself in and appreciate all the long, uninterrupted film takes that will make you hold your breath.<br/><br/>Need I even mention that I'd be thrilled beyond belief if there ends up being a sequel :)"
"Mindslack","10","6","16","22 January 2015"," Excellent action movie
","First off, in Keanu's personal life he has suffered quite horrific tragedy with his ex girlf and sister dying, so I felt that watching his wife in this circumstance dying would be quite horrible for him to go through. It is an interesting choice to say the least, as surely you would want to act out the opposite to real life? Maybe it was cathartic. <br/><br/>Secondly, this is an action movie with sprinklings of black humour throughout. Little real life moments where it comes up for air and then swiftly ducks it head back down into the crime world. I really appreciated that! The whole ""did he really just get away with that?"" kind of moment. <br/><br/>The storyline isn't award winning, or the Russian accents spot on, but as an action movie, how many of them have you felt the accents weren't right? Or the storyline wasn't so cripplingly in depth? I can think of many whose entire story plot could be written in a paragraph. Enjoy it for what it is and stop looking for a super elite snobby art-house film that isn't there. It is an ACTION movie. <br/><br/>I like the premise that the powerful crime people have access to a world with their own currency that separates them from the civilians, why couldn't that be a possibility? The hotel and club scene in the basement reminded me of Constantine a bit.<br/><br/>Sometimes you need a bit of simplicity in your life and a direct approach to things, and this film has you rooting for the good-bad guy (John), and that means some emotional investment, which works for me."
"wikipediacabal","9","6","16","21 January 2015"," Catnip for men who are still boys at heart
","In a period when the Hollywood studios stuff scripts with elements to appeal to every viewer demographic, this grindhouse style action picture keeps the focus on gunfights and car chases. However there is a style and intelligence present in this script that elevate the experience way above the norm for the genre.<br/><br/>I was reminded of Jack Reacher (2012), Payback (1999) and Get Carter (1971). All R rated movies, unfortunately for the 15 year old boys who would absolutely love them. It's irritating to me that the commercial need for the PG-13 rating has steered action films toward the comic book adaptations where death on screen is generally avoided. Although the film takes place in a heightened fantasy version of New York, it maintains a quite realistic style of fighting and action choreography. Most of the fights are settled by someone getting shot and killed.<br/><br/>There are a lot of angry, one-star reviews on IMDb. These are from people who don't like the genre and were expecting something character-driven. The professional reviewers rated the picture on how well it achieves what it set out to do, and it was quite well-reviewed indeed by those professionals.<br/><br/>The release didn't have a huge push behind it and it was a so-so performer at the domestic box office, but I think the essential enjoyability and quality here will translate into strong results as a rental. It did manage to edge out Expendables 3, a massively dumb effort to appeal to the same audience, and one that was crippled by its efforts to achieve a PG-13 and a broader appeal. It's good to see Keanu Reeves here in a project that is a perfect fit for his screen presence."
"paulwzhao-217-961327","8","6","16","19 January 2015"," Extremely entertaining, and satisfying revenge tale
","The film is lean, mean, effective and satisfying. If you are in the mood and itching for a brainless revenge tale and over the top action, John Wick will scratch that itch. <br/><br/>Granted, as it was mentioned by others, there are plot holes and sequences that defies logic and common sense. But a movie is a movie, it is like a fantasy that plays out on a big screen. Ask yourself, does any of your fantasies stand against the trial of logic? I guess not. So lets move on. <br/><br/>John Wick was lethal and ruthless professional hit man, and he was known for that. But he got out and he got comfortable. That's why in the beginning of the movie, he was a little slow and rusty. That was not a plot hole or scripting error. But as he step back into the dark world of the past, he started remembering and picking up the pace. He's becoming the legendary John Wick again right on the screen. And you feel that, and that is damn satisfying. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is John Wick! His woodiness and dead eye stare adds to overall feel of a killing machine that he was. Different from the roles he played before, he's more mature, more weathered. The sign of aging and roughness of his appearance now made him perfect for John Wick, and his usual arrogance and stubbornness just made John Wick more bad ass and fearless. He's perfectly dressed for cocktail party, but he kills like a rabid dog on drugs. He's effective and merciless, he cuts right to the point and no bullshit. He rarely talks. When he does open his mouth, nothing fancy or philosophical comes out. He wants revenge and he makes sure that he gets it. I don't know about you but I dig that. It's like a breath of fresh air. No more melodramatic moral dilemma. When all you had was taken away from you, you want to be John Wick, no freaking question asked!<br/><br/>This film has the style of noir and carnage of manga. It is not big on logic, but it is what it is: a no bullshit and no brainer revenge tale. You want to mess with me? Okay, let's see if I kill you all, how you are going to mess with me now?"
"Jerghal","9","6","16","19 January 2015"," Stylish old fashioned revenge movie
","John Wick is and old fashioned revenge movie -much like 'The Equalizer' is actually- but a lot more wicked (pun intended)! I think I don't have to explain how these revenge movies work: they (the character and the audience) need a reason to take/want revenge on the bad guys and then you can brace yourself for the violent killing spree that leads up to the main prize. What Keanu lacks in sympathetic warm charisma (like Denzel) he more than makes up in coolness and style. John Wick is just badass! The fights are excellently choreographed (Wick uses the Central Axis Relock System in combination with martial arts moves) and the gunfights are fast and furious. The overall design of the sets and costumes is very slick and stylish and the soundtrack also features some cool tunes. Although the script wasn't written with Reeves in mind, it does feel like it fits like a glove. John Wick wasn't a great box office success but I bet this will grow into a cult hit on DVD and Blu Ray. Do check it out!"

","First off, I made an IMDb account just to review this movie because I loved it so much and wanted to spread the word. This is really one of the best action movies in quite sometime. You must realize, this movie isn't meant to be realistic and is meant solely for entertainment. John Wick incorporates everything you could possibly want in an action flick, with a great soundtrack, great filming techniques, and just outstanding action. I really think this is Keanu Reeves' greatest movie. All the plot holes others are talking about aren't plot holes at all. They are just part of an amazing action flick that is meant to take people to a different reality, which has is why people go to the movies in the first place. I could not stop thinking about this movie for days after I saw it. Sorry for not being the greatest reviewer and writer, but you will not be disappointed if you go see this movie.

It's a crucial requirement for hit men to have a mediocre first name and quirky last name, as seen with Bond or Bourne, by this standard, John Wick has secured himself in pantheon of action heroes. His tale follows the known formula of one assassin returning to his old life, but what makes John Wick stands out is how vibrant and exciting the movie portrays him. From the nuance, visual and audio, everything looks like enhanced virtual reality or a very polished video game.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves, despite having impressive resume, might not be the most dynamic actor. He doesn't transform himself in every role, like say, Tom Cruise. However, with good direction and material, both are present in this movie, he will perform amazingly. This is one of Reeves' best roles aside from his in Matrix and Speed, he brings the air of confidence along with hidden yet excessive violence. Reeves display a good emotion as the character, and he also moves with certainty like a hit-man would. There is expert use of close quarter combat technique with multitude of fire arms and knowledge of martial arts for the foundation of the character. Although it is heavily brimmed with action elements, John Wick is also equipped with a bit of emotional baggage. From ancient time, the loss of loved one is an acceptable motive for incoming rampage.<br/><br/>The movie is exhibited with flair, its use of color is simply impressive. Every set piece is done with meticulous vivid visual. The camera angle makes it as though the world of John Wick is seen in different light, almost in the setting of enhanced modern noir. Each action is choreographed meticulously and it's a paramount aspect to make him believable as a lethal force. One of the best things about the action is how the fast pace can be captured with precision. Oftentimes movie employs shaky camera or highly uncoordinated editing. This movie manages to display action with clear focus and crisp movements, even at more crowded setting it never relents or overload the viewer with too much visual information.<br/><br/>Soundtracks help a lot with solemn tone and faster techno rhythm. It's probably one of the best soundtracks of this year, rivaling Hans Zimmerman's from The Amazing Spider-Man 2. There are not many action movies with this high of production value, it certainly packs enough fiery punch to leave a scorch mark for sequel, I won't be surprised if there's even a video game of it. With no Bond, Hunt or Bourne in sight, this may be the time for John Wick."
"mahalkosimaf","9","7","20","1 November 2014"," Jack Traven. Thomas Anderson. John Wick. Keanu Reeves is awesome again.
","This movie stars Keanu Reeves and was directed by 2 stunt men, decades-long collaborators of Keanu who worked his action scenes in ""Speed,"" ""Point Break,"" and the ""Matrix Trilogy."" This alone, is a good indication of the violence in this movie. <br/><br/>Set almost entirely at night in an otherworldly New York City, an asphalt jungle exclusively inhabited by violent criminals whose coexistence derives from a delicate balance of honor code and savage ruthlessness, John Wick is a sleek homage to Sergio Leone's Old West. In a world of lawlessness and violence, breaking the code, is the only transgression.<br/><br/>With his trademark blank stare and sparse words, Keanu Reeves steps into a persona straight out of a Sergio Leone western- an unstoppable force of nature, roused out of nowhere, whose sole purpose is comeuppance. <br/><br/>John Wick is a retired legendary hit-man in quiet agony over the recent passing of his beloved wife. His only recourse, is Daisy, an adorable puppy left by his wife to give his solitary existence some purpose. A charged encounter with Iosef, a braggart Russian mafioso eyeing Wick's 1969 Mustang (love the nod to McQueen!), results in a home invasion that ends with Wick badly beaten, Mustang gone, and Daisy dead! <br/><br/>Anytime a baddie kills a dog in a movie, you know a world of pain beckons. This is where the fun starts. <br/><br/>Iosef had no idea of John Wick's murderous past, and his disrespectful excursion into John Wick's quiet world in a time of mourning has his father, Viggo, clearly worried. In one scene Viggo scolds Iosef, ""he once killed 3 men with a pencil,"" and ""completed the most impossible missions,"" but gave it all up for the woman he loved; thus effectively mythologizing John Wick's badassery for the viewer even before he threw his first punch. <br/><br/>From here, John Wick checks in at the Continental, an exclusive hotel for assassins and criminals. Peace is preserved only by a strict code that prohibits ""doing business"" in its premises. Half- friends and half-enemies welcome him back, but he says he's just visiting. <br/><br/>Once the action gets going, only the body count is left unsettled as John Wick dispatches of everyone with his John Woo-ish ""gun-fu"" leaving a bloodbath in his wake. <br/><br/>Jack Traven. Thomas Anderson. John Wick. Keanu Reeves is awesome again."
"ddalley","9","7","20","29 October 2014"," Watch John wick before you see The Equalizer
","My wife and I saw both The Equalizer and John Wick back to back. In fact, we watched The Equalizer two nights in a row! If you like action movies, though, see John Wick first.<br/><br/>The martial arts in John Wick are much better choreographed and John is not the Teflon Man in The Equalizer. He shows his vulnerability by getting in trouble and pays dearly for it.<br/><br/>However, there is a considerable amount of humour included with the violence in John Wick and enough new ideas, such as the use of gold coins, to keep the movie fresh throughout.<br/><br/>This is a good deal: excellent action, fun, no shaky-cam and acting, even though Keanu is still deadpan. This movie is a keeper!"
"LloydBayer","8","7","20","29 October 2014"," Oozing style and blistering momentum, John Wick is an unrelenting but thoroughly gratifying action film.
","When was the last time you saw a good old fashioned action film? I'm talking about the type of balls-out carnage that existed much before the likes of Michael Bay's dependency on faux-pas image generation. Packed with style, energy, and blistering momentum, John Wick is not just a frame by frame restoration of old-school mayhem, its unrelenting audacity kicks the growing trend for watered down action in the groin. If it is action you want, action you get – no holds barred and thoroughly gratifying.<br/><br/>Helming the film is David Leitich as producer and Chad Stahelski as first time director, both expert fight chorographers and stunt doubles from over two decades of action thrillers. The latter was also responsible for those genre defining action scenes in The Matrix trilogy, besides standing in as Keanu Reeves' stunt double in other films. Speaking of which, Reeves hasn't been in anything memorable since the aforementioned trilogy but returns to form as the titular mob assassin whose very mention irks jittery nerves from New York City cops to the Russian mafia and everyone in between. Mourning the untimely loss of his wife, Wick is brought out of retirement after crossing paths with his former mob employers. Not only do they steal his 1969 Mustang, they also kill his adorable puppy – a posthumous gift from his wife to ease her passing. Now what do they say about taunting a man with a short fuse and nothing to lose? With an arsenal of firearms at his disposal, Wick unleashes a bullet barrage and won't stop until mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) and his overindulged son Iosef (Alfie Allen) join the ascending body count.<br/><br/>Although lacking a meaty story, Derek Kolstad's script might seem like yet another revenge film that glorifies characters with a 'particular set of skills'. Needless to say, characters with this skillset are on the rise and just recently we saw Denzel Washington open a can of whoop-ass in The Equalizer. Where John Wick differs is in its unapologetic approach as a violent revenge film with no room for dramatic twists and turns. This is also what makes the film fun to watch because all you have to do is take in the thickening layers of brutality following each wave of fluidly filmed fight scenes.<br/><br/>With intense shootouts (a hefty dollop of which are gritty head shots) and close quarter brute force, the action rarely slows. If it does, it's during moments of straight-faced humour and Kolstad's strategic placement of supporting characters. Willem Dafoe and Adrianne Palicki play fellow assassins. One aids Wick while the other is contracted to kill him. In the neutral zone is Ian McShane who plays the owner of an upscale hotel that serves as a safe house for all assassins. It's a clever touch that says a little more about their profession and the unwritten code of ethics that goes with it. As an only perceivable downside, there isn't much emotion from anyone except Daisy the ill-fated dog. Then again, it's a snug fit for Reeves and the payoff is watching him live up to Wick's reputation of a stone cold killing machine. One scene even has Viggo reciting a verse that fables Wick as the bogyman himself. I'm thinking more along the lines of Keyser Söze in the flesh. Wick-ed indeed."
"SangamYadagiri","9","7","20","27 October 2014"," Slick action flick
","I happen to watch John Wick in the IMAX and I loved it being a part of the movie. At first, John Wick seems to be an outdated action movie. But then while watching it, it seems to be a never seen before action thriller. Without going much into the story line, I would like to emphasize on the movie's fresh look.<br/><br/>Every rule that was used or created for a gangster or retired gangster movie (Especially, Carlito's way) has been renewed in this movie. The story line is simple on the paper but when it comes to writing screenplay for this movie, every old run must be broken and be redefined. And then the execution must have a lot of improvisations.<br/><br/>Be it the entry of the protagonist, relationship with his murdered wife and the dog, the ending, everything is shown less than what we have already seen enough in previous films. The main focus has been put on the action part and everything else is shown as implicit part of action.<br/><br/>The cause of the revenge is totally funny at times but has a fresh and serious look on the other side.<br/><br/>Without Keanu, the movie would not even be justified. His screen presence makes the movie more than watchable. The screenplay and direction are brilliant. The music is loud at times but suits the theme of the movie.<br/><br/>I would give 9 out of 10."
"StephenBB81","8","7","20","26 October 2014"," Great Action Movie, Keanu Reeves was better than expected.
","This movie is worth Seeing. The action is excellent and on going, It has humour elements like the First Boondock Saints which I would say is the closest relatable movie to this one. Keanu played Keanu, no real dialogue short choreographed fight scenes and lots of close ups. I can get over Keanu because the pure foolishness of the entire movie is what the Expendables should have been, a collection of great actors (and Keanu) in a fun happy shoot-em up movie.<br/><br/>It was refreshing that people with guns decided to USE guns, no silly fighting smacking each other with guns if there was a chance to shoot someone it pretty much happened.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, enjoy it. Forgive the Casting director."
"Drive-in_Zeppelin","8","7","20","25 October 2014"," Ever fired your gun up in the air while shouting ""aaargh""?
","I was initially really worried about going to see this movie. The trailer looked like the type of movie I would immediately be turned off of (despite loving action movies). All I can say now is wow, I had fun in this movie, like 'edge of my seat shooting at the screen with my fingers' fun. If the hearting thumping adrenaline pumping electronica/metal soundtrack doesn't get you in the mood for mayhem, then you can just delight in the now 50 yr old Keanu Reeves ascending to the highest level of action star. Seriously, the movie is just him running around 2 hours shooting people in the face. <br/><br/>Now a lot of people will be turned off by the sound of that, but that's basically all a revenge movie is. The plot synopsis is literally just 'Russians mess with a retired hit-man and he has to kill them all'. Don't hate it. Indulge in the gratuitous action. Eat popcorn to your hearts content (or until it leads to heart disease). I ain't afraid of no John Wick!<br/><br/>Similar to The Equalizer a few weeks back, John Wick's strength as an action movie is that it excels in all things visual and technical. This movie is sleek, sexy and downright fun. The visuals are perfect for a high energy, high octane shoot-em-up and are complemented by a score that gets you pumped up for violence. <br/><br/>On screen Reeves is supported by tremendous actors like Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick. Even the ""Mayhem"" guy makes an appearance. They all embrace that the fact that its just an action movie and the strength of the film is that it doesn't try and pander to the audience with some god awful message about morality or over-complicate the story.<br/><br/>Visually I thought there were some pretty fun elements like the way the Russian subtitles were presented, and that all the stunts and special effects are meticulously crafted and choreographed. It looks and feels like a movie should where everyone knows the main character is a force to be reckoned with. Seriously, Wick just head- shots everything. Expect lots of violence and expect to be entertained. That's all you can truly hope for in a good action flick and yet John Wick adds that little extra bit of humor and style that set the standard for the genre in years to come. <br/><br/>Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website"
"mariposa-9","Null","7","20","25 October 2014"," Keanu, a focused, bad ass!
","Yesterday I saw the first matinée showing of John Wick. Like I anticipated, judging by reviews, it was well worth my time. However, what I didn't anticipate was how ordinary the story was. We've seen this type of story many times where the Hero has an excuse to kill a lot of people.<br/><br/>What separates John Wick from other films of this type is it's style. I don't remember seeing people get shot in the head and then blood splatter in such a way. Many times this happened, and it's very effective. But more than anything, it's Keanu Reeves' focus that makes this movie special.<br/><br/>Many times I'll watch a film, and look to see the actor, ""acting"", or just going through the motions for a paycheck. The last Indiana Jones adventure comes to mind. But throughout every frame of John Wick Keanu Reeves is 100% focused on the character. In the fight scenes, many of them, I never saw a stunt man. That was Keanu, potent, violent, and effective.<br/><br/>For me, the movie could have used a little more exposition, i.e a little more Bridget Moynahan, and a little more of his bonding with the dog. There probably was in the original cut, but I'm sure some hotshot exec said ""cut all that stuff out. They just wanna see Keanu kick ass!"" But don't get me wrong. This film is a must see, for stylized action sequences and particularly, Keanu Reeves' performance. The latter is really something to see."

","John Wick(ed) used over a 500 bullets, I stopped counting after 30 minutes. The acting is a one=pose acting. All movie the same Keanu look. The plot is thin as exhaled smoke of a menthol cigarette. No bullet came even close to JW. When his wife passed away, he took himself a puppy-dog, the only affection he showed in the movie, sorry and for his car, a great car, a Mustang. The car was stolen by the sun of a godfather en he killed the dog, it was a young nice puppy, no need to be killed. Then John filled and refilled all the guns he had.It took him a couple a days to kill everyone with a gun. The police had a day off, I suppose"
"Bwohahaha","8","5","13","29 January 2015"," Entertaining, Stylish And Some Wickedly Awesome Actions
","Keanu Reeves existence was almost an apparition or ilk in his acting career since the phenomenal Matrix series. Despite delivering some authentic roles in remarkable blockbusters the guy Neo as we know disappeared along with the Matrix a decade ago possibly into the depths of a Matrix itself. His chief contribution from the asylum was frequent mediocre roles that didn't do justice to his potentials and a load of tedious second-rate movies that we didn't see come and go; and yes, except one or two. Keanu is a good actor, a typecast action hero. He could have done a lot better, choose some notable characters or somebody could have saved this poor chap by giving him a role that he truly deserved. And finally it took director duos David Leitch and Chad Stahelski to become the saviors. Keanu is saved. Or in more apt words, Keanu is back. This is his best movie released since a long time. <br/><br/>Ignore the aforesaid statements. Considering his movies of the past decade the 'Sad Keanu' Meme was totally legitimate.<br/><br/>John Wick is a wickedly entertaining 100 minutes of exhilarating marathon killing spree show that will make your butt go flabbergasted; with comparatively less elaborated plot and forthright twists. It doesn't have an impressive story arc to brag about but a straightforward account of a retired hit-man seeking vengeance for the killing of his beloved dog. And boy does he seek that out with style and elegance. It also features an awesome soundtrack.<br/><br/>The quirk about the movie is its action and in its execution. And the fight sequences are likely to be one of the all-time best in films. Keanu Reeves literally invokes the phantom of some dead martial art legend to make your limbs uncomfortable doing nothing. He is said to have undergone four months of learning judo and some nutcracker techniques developing special close-quarter combat style and wicked skills. And does it reflect throughout the movie. John Wick is mostly about the remarkable style of action. Its approach toward the assassins and their cult offers some rather exciting insights into how do they pull off the jobs and how things work in their terms and conditions. <br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of action movies. The one reason I discount most of those movies is due to their unconvincing and improbable outlook of a superhuman hero to whom logic and physics doesn't apply. John Wick on the other hand boasts not about the impossible and implausible abilities a man on vengeance is capable of fostering. The character John Wick is portrayed as a highly skilled assassin; someone who was in the business for a long enough time to master his moves. There is no fancy action movie cliché like bullet repelling body, instant recovery, flying off of buildings or the insane jumps. <br/><br/>The crispy combat style and background music pumps some impressive energy into the action; John Wick is one of the best action flicks I had seen. There isn't a solid story or a clash of brains but if you are fan of action movies or looking to watch something for fun and get pumped up, then there isn't a better entertaining action flick released in the recent years than John Wick."
"TheSquiss","2","5","13","21 January 2015"," Keanu Reeves repays a favour in this hit-man stinker. Not good. VERY not good!
","Another day, another review. In the case of John Wick, there's a really short version: Don't bother.<br/><br/>John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a recently bereaved man whose wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan) kindly, inexplicably, managed to replace herself with a perfectly timed puppy so that John won't be lonely. He also owns a car. Shortly after burying his wife, John takes his dog and fills up his car at the gas station where he attracts the attention of thug Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen, recently seen in Plastic). Iosef wants the car, John doesn't want to sell it, Iosef resolves the issue that night by rearranging John's face, killing the dog and stealing the car. Needless to say, John is a little narked and phones up Iosef's dad, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) to complain. The thing is, John Wick is a retired hit-man and all-round killing machine.<br/><br/>John Wick could have been resolved painlessly in five minutes: ""Your son killed my dog and now I want to kill him. If you don't let me, I'll kill everybody you employ, everybody you know and every inanimate object you own."" ""Okay, he'll be home in half an hour. Come on over""<br/><br/>No such luck.<br/><br/>It starts slowly, stutters and plummets thereafter.<br/><br/>John Wick is the type of film that gives credibility to the opinion that Keanu Reeves stinks on the big screen. It isn't right (sometimes), it isn't fair but in this instance it is fairly accurate. In reality, Reeves is the second best thing (after the dog) in this tedious, ham-fisted mess that attempts to be a thriller, but I suspect there is more to it than that. He isn't awful, he just doesn't appear to be trying. He gives every impression of gritting his teeth, and taking the money before he wanders back into the safe obscurity of the horizon. He looks bored and I suspect he's fulfilling a favour and hoping he escapes in tact.<br/><br/>John Wick is the directorial debut of both Chad Stahelski (stunt coordinator and Reeves' double on Constantine, The Matrix films, The Replacements, Point Break) and an uncredited David Leitch, who happened to be a stuntman on Constantine and Matrix Revolutions. Either this is one hell of a favour or Keanu Reeves lost big time on the between-the-scenes poker marathons.<br/><br/>As we found with The Interview and This is the End, having two directors doesn't mean the film is going to be twice as good. John Wick is proof again that if one director can't make it work, a second director only serves to shoulder the blame. Stahelski and Leitch have hired a goon to 'write' this mess and have then proceeded to direct it in the same manner i.e. in block capitals and armed with wax crayons.<br/><br/>Scattered throughout John Wick are subtitles that float across the screen (no bad thing) with random words picked out in block capitals to give the impression of the speakers SHOUTING random WORDS whenever they feel LIKE it (VERY bad THING indeed!). I'm just going to gloss over the needlessly capitalized words sprinkled through them.<br/><br/>The performances in John Wick are frequently, painfully wooden and from a cast that also either owed favours (Willem Dafoe) or were cheap (the rest). It plods, lines are repeated and the costume design clearly consisted of shopping; EVERYONE is wearing brand new clothes! <br/><br/>John Wick contains some fine action sequences in which Keanu Reeves swings a variety of weapons with maximum effect, but when there is complete reliance on blood spatter and gunfire and a complete oversight when it comes to script, direction, performance, logic and reason, no matter how good your star is, your film is in serious trouble.<br/><br/>To refer to my original statement, there is a slightly longer short version: <br/><br/>Don't waste your time, money or breath watching, thinking or talking about John Wick.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"gianfrancolevati","9","5","13","20 January 2015"," KR is back!
","Finally a KR's movie worth watching. A nice flat pop corn movie, zero brain needed, sheer subculture (even the easy recalls to mythology are uber sheer subculture), lots of fun.<br/><br/>The action is great and I will summarize the quality of some actions by saying: a movie where guns don't shoot 2000 rounds before the clip is empty! The weapons guy did a great job indeed. And geeks like me normally count the shots of a Beretta.<br/><br/>And of course the (apparently unique) motive of the dead dog is a bit silly, to start spreading dead people around the City: that is the trick used since Lethal Weapon (the scene where he cries alone and looks like he's going to take is own life) to give some humanity to the character. To start a war for nothing is dumb. To start it over a dead dog is even worse. Let's say this guy had some anger management issues within himself and they gave him a reason to vent it out.<br/><br/>I have read some of the reviews and I am sorry some people had expectations and are now disappointed. I had no expectations at all. Before watching the movie the scary part was the thought of KR acting. Yet... his expressionless face is *absolutely* *perfect* for the part. 100%.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, starting with Nyqvist, is absolutely great.<br/><br/>I haven't seen retarded movies like this in a while. The only one that can compare is Hit-man.<br/><br/>Why don't I give a 10? Because he stole a dog. You don't destroy an army of Russky mobsters and then do that. Next time what? Steal candy bars in a 7/11? That is the only weak spot in the whole movie.<br/><br/>So get XXL pop corns, a huge soda, and enjoy. :)"

"captainmike-michael","7","5","13","23 November 2014"," John Wick Portrays Keanu Reeves who Back in a Solid Action Thriller
","This action adventure presents a simple, straightforward violence and revenge movie that does not offer any refreshing idea, but some creatively designed small elements in the gangsterism world and its political cultures however might surprise the audiences. John Wick is definitely portraying Keanu Reeves rather than the other way round who used to be expressionless or impassive, cool and less talking, and perhaps his personality and life experience might be the two important factors that make him suits perfectly in this character full with sorrow, miserable and anger. More than three quarters of the film are filled with stylish scores, adrenalin-rush and thrilling action art sequences captured in great angles and cinematography, but the emotional built-up and the relationship with the cute puppy in the beginning seems to be too short, pushing the film towards a slight monotonous ending."
"kylejjaustin","9","5","13","4 November 2014"," John Wick – short fuse.
","John Wick is a former mob assassin who comes out of retirement to seek vengeance against the criminals who kill his dog and steal his car.<br/><br/>Just before John Wick's (Keanu Reeves) wife dies from an unspecified illness, she arranges for a Beagle puppy named Daisy to be delivered to him after her death to help him cope with his grieving. A few days later he goes for a ride in his vintage muscle car. At a gas station, three shady men approach him and offer to buy his car. Wick refuses but the three follow him home, brutally attack him, kill his dog and steal the car. Losing Daisy, the only living link to his wife, lights John Wick's wick. The former assassin takes matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>Using his former skills, Wick learns that the three men are Russian mobsters, one of whom is the son of mob boss, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He is also Wick's former employer. When Tarasov learns what his spoilt son (Alfie Allen) has done, he attempts to extend Wick an olive branch. Wick, however, is already on the warpath and out for blood. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves' performance is badass, full of energy and even demonstrates some emotional range, a welcome change from his usual wooden performances. He continues his career-long habit and does most of his own stunt work. Michael Nyqvist, best known for the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo films, is intimidating and over the top as the mob boss. Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen is despicable as the mob boss's son, and like his character in the TV series, you'll love to hate him. However, his Russian accent is almost laughable.<br/><br/>One of the film's best aspects is its creation of a whole new criminal underworld. A 'clean up' service for body disposal is accessible to hit men and there's an establishment called the Continental Hotel, a safe haven where professionals are forbidden to carry out 'jobs' on the premises. The professionalism and efficiency of the mob network adds more layers to both the story and main character. Wick's wit and proficiency, are clearly a product of a sophisticated culture of rampant crime. This also gives the film potential for a sequel. <br/><br/>John Wick is a simple revenge story, with fast-paced action and hand-to-hand gunfights some critics are calling, 'gun fu'. The film is consistent with the gritty reality of other action films such as Taken and The Bourne series. For all who enjoy a good action flick with lots of guns, explosions and high voltage fight scenes, this is the movie for you."

"dgluth","7","6","17","7 November 2014"," Fun for the right reasons.
","Leitch and Stahelski make a wonderful team directing and producing what is overall a passably fun action film. The two have done stunts in many, many films and their understanding of good action choreography really comes to light in John Wick. The numerous fights are fast, frenetic and creative. <br/><br/>Reeves is certainly at the best he's been in a while, but don't expect to be blown away. The catatonic nature that has held him since the mid '00s seems to be fading away. Just reference this and 47 Ronin (2013) and the fantastic Reeves directed Man of Tai Chi (2013).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast seems to be having fun, especially Dafoe who cameos as an aging hit-man. Nyqvist is the other standout in the bunch, delightfully adding dark comedy to his bits rambling about the dangerous John Wick. There is no doubt that this is Reeves' show, but everyone else doesn't seem to be just phoning it in. <br/><br/>The set design and the cinematography are absolutely fantastic. Action scenes are held in intricately detailed environments, most notably a neon-washed nightclub scene that will really dazzle your eyes. The color palates are suitably washed, with sudden bursts of color such as in the aforementioned night club. <br/><br/>Where everything production-wise comes together correctly, the writing seems to be what holds this down from being an action classic. It is at times witty and engaging, yes, but its mainly a mish-mash of tired clichés to string you along its gorgeous set pieces. The revenge story is one of the oldest in cinema. Hybridizing it with the ""you killed my dog, now you'll pay"" trope was clever, but ultimately not enough to stand out. <br/><br/>In the end, John Wick is a fun flick worth watching with a group of friends. Don't expect much cerebrally, but be sure to keep a sharp eye for the rich detail put into every frame of this well- crafted action film."
"3xHCCH","7","6","17","4 November 2014"," Keanu's Back with a Vengeance
","The career of Keanu Reeves seemed to have taken a nosedive after the success of the Matrix films. We would be hard put to name even one film after that. Last year, he directed a martial arts film called Man of Tai Chi, where he played antagonist to a less than charismatic leading man. That did not fly too high, except perhaps for some hardcore action fans. For this year though, the buzz for this film ""John Wick"" was simply too high to ignore. <br/><br/>The plot is ripped off the plots of many other old-fashioned action films, especially those from the 1980s. JOhn Wick is a retired hit man. He is still very depressed about his wife's death. One day, a group of thugs break into John's house and destroy his wife's one most precious gift to him. John finds out the perpetrator Iosef is the crazy spoiled son of his old boss, Viggo. John then goes on a deadly revenge rampage until no one is left alive.<br/><br/>Yes, there is not much about that script to be excited about. However, for their first directorial effort, David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, the stunt coordinators for Keanu Reeves in ""Matrix"", make a spectacular debut. Their action sequences were fast-clipped, very exciting and relentlessly brutal. Be it gunplay, knife-play or martial arts, Keanu Reeves made a perfect action hero.<br/><br/>A lot of this film's success also comes because of Reeves' excellence in dramatic acting. Okay, so there only few of those moments. We will remember fondly his devotion to his wife, which Reeves was able to project very well without words. He was sincerely in those touching scenes."

","If you've seen Shoot 'Em Up you'll know exactly what this movie should have been. That was a relentless rip-roaring and most importantly, humorous jaunt from beginning to end. Mr Smith was an accidental hero pitted against impossible odds, and he out gunned them with a lot of bullets, flair and sometimes even with just a carrot. <br/><br/>That was Mr Smith. Mr Wick is an ex-gangster with a chip on his shoulder. He's a man who kills people not with carrots but with a pencil. He is no hero; he's just the Boogeyman out for revenge and he doesn't care who gets hurt. <br/><br/>Mr Smith saved a baby and bought down an evil congressman and a wicked corporation. Mr Wick kills 150 people without remorse because a punk killed his dog. He doesn't rescue anyone except himself, and ironically (although it's doubtful the film makers realized it) after having spent the whole movie avenging the loss of his dog he steals somebody else's. This was doubtless a director's attempt to assign some meaning to the end of what was really a pointless story.<br/><br/>Sorry Keanu, going to have to give this one the thumbs down. A story really does matter."
"TdSmth5","9","4","10","16 February 2015"," Great action
","A car crashes against a wall. A seriously injured guy tumbles out. He starts watching a video of him with a woman.<br/><br/>That takes us to the beginning in cut scenes. The guy was celebrating his anniversary with the woman who is ill. That night she collapses and dies in the hospital. The guy is devastated. Later he gets a delivery. It's a puppy. The woman arranged it to be sent to him once she dies, so he doesn't have to mourn alone.<br/><br/>Next morning he goes for a drive in his classic Mustang with the puppy. At a gas station some Russian offers to buy the car. The guy refuses. The Russian doesn't take it too well. At night a bunch of masked guys break into the guy's house, kill the puppy, beat him up and steal the car. They take the car to a shop where the owner is outraged at the stupidity of the Russian. He known who the car belongs to. Then he gets a call from the Russian's father who's the big mobster. The shop owner tells him the son just stole John Wick's car.<br/><br/>Now we learn from the mobster about John. He was the baddest unstoppable killing machine around till he retired when he met his wife. So he knows what's coming. His son doesn't get it and thinks he can do something about it. He sends an army to visit John at night. John dispatches them all and calls a specialized cleaning crew afterward. Now John unearths his gear, puts on a nice suit and checks into the Continental hotel--a safe house for hit men. There everyone thinks that John is back in business. He clarifies that it's just personal. The mobster puts a bounty on his head and that means that all the bad guys in town will go after him, including some at the safe house--which goes against the rules.<br/><br/>John now goes after the son and eventually after the mobster father and later we return to the beginning.<br/><br/>The trailer promised exhilarating action and the movie delivers. It's old-fashioned pistol action and athletic fisticuffs. If the title Bullet for the Head weren't taken it could have made an apt title for this movie as well, as John isn't just happy to empty a clip into some bad guy but has to finish things off by blowing their skulls open. It's R-rated action as it should be. When bloody action if filmed for PG-13 standards you end up with duds like the Taken sequels. It also has some original car action, not so much chases but cars used for shootouts. Cool stuff. Perhaps it goes a bit overboard in manipulating your emotions. It's not enough that the wife dies and that he's heart-broken, but they've got to kill the puppy and steal the cool car. But it was expected as dogs always end up dead in Hollywood movies. But while he's alive, the dog character and actor really do a solid job. The whole Russians as bad guys is getting a bit tired. Is it that hard to do something original in Hollywood?<br/><br/>What is particularly interesting is the whole underground hit men culture. The safehouse/hotel, the rules, the cleaning crew and so on. Reeves is always likable even when all he does is shoot at people. But this movie has another thing going for it and that is Michael Nyqvist who is incapable of not giving a spectacular performance. You can just tell he gets a kick out of every role he plays. Looking forward to part 2."

It's directed by a couple of newcomers, David Leitch & Chad Stahelski, who have worked as stunt men on the Matrix movies with Keanu. Keanu plays a retired assassin-yeah,like they can ever just retire-that gets married, then his wife dies and then he gets sucked back into the business. His nickname when he was working was The Boogeyman. Michael plays a Russian mob boss that has a stupid son; his son steals Keanu's car and kills Keanu's dog-see? stupid. I know, the plot sounds like it could be a great country music song; He looses his wife, he looses his car and then he looses his dog. But the plot is not the best part of this movie. It's the action. The fights are incredible, as well as the gun play. Willem plays a former associate to Keanu-he used to give Keanu his assignments, back before he retired and Adrianne plays a fellow assassin, that wants in on the action. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

It wasn't much speaking. It was all about the fight scenes. It became nonstop and didn't slow down. It's definitely a step up from 47 Ronin. <br/><br/>In a way, this film will remind you of The Equalizer, BUT The Equalizer was a lot better. It was still a good film for Reeves, and hopefully, we'll see him again like this. <br/><br/>If you need a film for this weekend, something to have you on the edge of your seat and just enjoying an adrenaline rush, go see John Wick."

"mark-durfor","7","5","14","19 November 2014"," Like Neesan in Taken or Stallone in Get Carter, Reeves is perfect in this revenge thriller
","http://marksmoviemind.blogspot.com///john-wick-review.html This movie delivers everything the preview claims it will deliver and once again Keanu Reeves has picked the perfect movie for his acting abilities. The dialogue is limited and there are some good one-liners throughout, but most of it is action. The only criticism I can make, that I noted in my preview, is that some of the gun fights are a little unrealistic. Wick has been out of the scene for 5 years now and makes some comments throughout the movie that he is ""rusty"" when he shows up at places with some battle wounds. Yet, when it comes to the gun fights, his aim is dead on perfect while his opponents couldn't hit water if they fell off the Titanic in the middle of the ocean.<br/><br/>When Viggo is telling his son about John Wick, he tells the story of a Russian folklore character called the Boogeyman. His son laughs at the idea of Wick being that man and Viggo tells him that Wick is worse, he's the one you send in to kill the Boogeyman. There are two important lessons about being John Wick. First, as I mentioned before referring to the posters for the movie, ""don't set him off"". And these unapologetic punks do just that. The second lesson is don't burn your bridges. In sprite of what John Wick was and what he did, he made some powerful allies and lived by a certain code that helped him many times throughout the movie. It's this code that is more powerful than money that kept Wick alive and helped him to exact his revenge.<br/><br/>I predicted 3.5 stars and I'm going to keep that rating. The preview perfectly sets you up for precisely what the movie is. Like Liam Neeson in Taken or Sylvester Stallone in Get Carter, Reeves is the perfect actor to portray John Wick and is believable and enjoyable in the role. It is extremely violent and graphic, but it is also fun and humorous at times. My friend, Nick, feels this is one that should definitely be purchased for a home collection. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I do think it was worth the price of admission in the theatre and one I would readily watch again when it is available for rent. So, what movie will be on my mind next? We shall see."

","The start of this movie was a promising one. Stylish shots and images, nice art direction. Fine storytelling to, providing a decent background for the main character, while at the same time introducing some cool players (and great actors, like Willem Dafoe and Michael Nyqvist). In just a few images we feel for John Wick and we really want to know how he's going to live the rest of his live. And then the shooting begins. And continues. And continues. And continues until every logic or possibility to feel any empathy at all has vanished completely. The movie has turned itself into a brainless shooting game with no story whatsoever, no plausible motives, not one character that we can relate to and hardly any reason for the cinema loving public to want to make it till the end of the story."

","Revenge action films are some of the easiest and most enthralling subgenres in the action genre. You have a character that loses something important whether it be a loved one or something else and they go on a rampage against those people that took everything. It's a simple yet very sympathetic plot line that when done right they can deliver on the action. John Wick is a shining example of less is more where the plot is simple, but the execution is done so well it overcomes those shortcomings.<br/><br/>Good: The main draw is Keanu Reeves who really does deliver a great performance as the titular character. Reeves is a silent force of nature who really brings a lot of sympathy during his period of loss and when he lets loose on the bad guys it is glorious. The movie is directed by a couple of well known stuntmen and it shows with some great choreography in the fight scenes and smooth camera-work with no shaky camera which is refreshing to see.<br/><br/>Bad: The ending is very anti-climactic which hurt the movie a bit considering the energy on display beforehand.<br/><br/>Overall, it is just a well-done revenge action film.

"ActionFan-Reviews","8","6","18","2 November 2014"," One Of The Best Pure Action Films Of This Era !!
","When I had first heard of John Wick, I didn't think much of it. Just thought it was another forgettable movie that will join the bargain bin in a few months. But after viewing the trailer, and hearing some of the reviews, I thought I should check it out and see whether the reviews and hype was genuine. I will say as a fan of action films this provided some solid adrenaline and non-stop action. Now in order to have such glorious and justifiable violence in a film, the main character needs to have motivation and something really bad happen to them. What would make a man more angry than having his prized car stolen and a dog given to him by his dead wife killed by ruthless gangsters! Enter John Wick and let the hell fire begin as he mows them down in a glorious rain of bullets and explosions. If there's an action film this year you can mention in the same breath as The Raid 2 it is John Wick (Sorry Expendables 3). It is definitely one of the more stylish, fun and original action movies I've seen in a while and reminded me of such classics as Equilibrium or the hyper-violent Hong Kong films like Hard Boiled or The Killer. Asides from the action, it has a solid supporting cast and I know Keanu may not be the best actor, but he has certainly improved from the old days and does a great job in this movie. Willem Dafoe is great as always and Adrianne Palicki also does great in her role. The directors did a great job staging and shooting the scenes and providing a solid environment for it to take place in. Overall, a solid and fun action packed film that will surely satisfy your blood lust for some Hard R action. This is definitely one of the best of 2014, up there with The Equalizer and The Raid 2. This movie rightfully so will stand as an action classic of this time. <br/><br/>8/10"
"Troy_Campbell","8","6","18","1 November 2014"," Enjoyably silly with style to spare.
","In his first bona fide hit for quite some time, Keanu Reeves is an assassin on a warpath after Russian crims kill his puppy and steal his car. If that sounds a touch silly, that's because it is, but this movie whole-heartedly embraces its bonkers premise and revels in presenting a genre film with tongue firmly in cheek. Screenwriter Derek Kolstad builds a semi-fantastical world where hit men (and hitwomen of course) have their own underworld currency, a special hotel sanctuary with doctors on site and a nightclub where hired killers can unwind, and, obviously, a guild who ensures the assassin moral code is upheld. This endearing self- awareness ensures John Wick is amusingly engaging between the numerous action sequences, which are, surprisingly, of an extremely high calibre. A blend of the economic gun-fu from Equilibrium and the close quarters krav maga made popular in the Bourne trilogy, the expertly choreographed fight scenes (tacked on finale excluded) are frenetic, exhilarating and joyously violent. Reeves is clearly having a blast playing the revenge driven yet cool-as-a-cucumber protagonist, whilst the rest of the cast – including Willem Dafoe, Adrianne Palicki, Michael Nyqvist and Alfie ""Theon Greyjoy from GoT"" Allen – do what they can with shared screen time; Palicki's arrogant hired gun shining brightest. A B-grade flick wrapped in A-grade style, John Wick is exceptionally enjoyable."
"matthewssilverhammer","9","6","18","1 November 2014"," Mindlessly Awesome
","John Wick is a lot of things. It's an action thriller that starts with a jarring bang and never lets up. It's a modern-day western over-run by black hats. It's Refn's Drive, only faster, louder, funnier, and wilder. It's punchy and smooth, tough and violent, and refreshingly brash. It's also relatively straight-forward and by-the-numbersbut if you're gonna make a straight-forward, by-the numbers revenge thriller, take note: this is how you do it with hutzpah. Reeves plays a grieving husband whose wife, as her dying action, gets him a puppy to cope with the loss. When some Russian thugs break into his house to steal his car and kill his dog, he goes on a calculated killing spree to exact revenge. It's a corny, stupid premise that succeeds in part from Keanu's own personal history and the genuine sweetness in the dog-owner relationship. It's a fully formed universe of characters that we meet (the gangster hotel manager, the eccentric lobby boy, the good-natured dead-body clean-up crew) that nicely compliment the effectively awesome yet human Wick. Sure, there are moments of exploitation, and some may think it's just vengeance porn, but I disagree. The attitude of the film is pitch-perfect: it's an angry film that doesn't let its rage get in the way of its immense entertainment, and is never too serious for its own good. It perfectly balances the fast-loud with the slow-quiet. The non-linear storytelling, the sharp humor, and the portrayal of what happens between action scenes all give it a cool feel. Mindless entertainment? Maybebut when something's this excellent, who cares?"
"Suave785","9","6","18","23 October 2014"," John Wick would beat the s**t out of Neo in a bar fight
","If you walk into this movie expecting to see the next Oscar winner for Best Picture you will be sadly disappointed. John Wick is a great movie but it was geared towards providing entertainment value and not too heavy on trying to garner Academy votes. Simply put, this is the greatest action film of the year. That is a lot to say when you had Snowpiercer, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Edge of Tomorrow, and The Raid 2:Berandal all hitting the big screen before John Wick. What makes this film rather unique is not the storyline. There isn't much substance to the plot. John Wick kills well over 100 plus different people in this movie. That is not a spoiler by any means. But nobody expected Keanu Reeves to be cast as a retired assassin who must fuel his yearnings for vengeance with a fresh body count. The only other actor that could of played the title part for this movie is Chow Yun-Fat. I viewed this movie in IMAX and you can most certainly tell the film was not formatted for IMAX viewing in any way shape or form. Yet it just felt good to see John Wick conduct his own symphony of death on a bigger screen. The bottom line is that if you like John Woo action-style movies and enjoy a pretty high body count this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a movie to take a first date out on or treat the kids to this weekend you may want to reconsider. Sorry for not being very descriptive. I believe it's best to let you watch the relaunch of Keanu Reeve's film career with this deadly masterpiece on your own accord. You won't be disappointed."
"ayoreinf","9","6","18","27 October 2014"," twice compared, and coming out rather well
","I stated more than once over here that though I don't like comparing movies, sometimes a comparison is unavoidable. This is doubly so for John Wick. First is the almost automatic comparison with The Equalizer. Another retired professional killer forced out of retirement into an all out collision with the Russian mob, (boy, are they once again the popular bad guys in town). Well, despite some obvious casting advantages the earlier release has over John Wick, mainly as far as the leading role is concerned, The final result is working in favor of John Wick. It's plot is much more believable than The Equalizer's, it's fight scenes are way more real, look less like a choreographed ballet and more like a fight to the death, in which both sides are drawing blood.<br/><br/>The second comparison I feel that I must make goes a bit further back, all the way to Eastwood's masterpiece Unforgiven. Another man with a bad past coming back to avenge a seemingly minor crime, this time not hired but much more driven and there a few other similar plot twists which I can't discuss without adding a spoiler. Once again we have a film debating the nature of evil, and when is evil not really evil, and John Wick doesn't do too badly in this comparison as well. I must refer to Keanu Reeves shortcomings as an actor. His range is well known as limited but he usually has a flare for choosing the right roles for his abilities, he does exceptionally well here, despite some early wooden moments at the very beginning of the film. The rest of the cast is superlative, apart from Michael Nyqvist, who's delivery in English leaves a lot to be desired. Yes the language should sound foreign in his mouth, but the emotions should still be there, and they often felt forced too me. The rest is very well done, the pace, the cinematography, all were right on the spot for the film. A proof that action flicks can be thoughtful and emotionally true."

","In John Wick, writer Derek Kolstad and director Chad Stahelski have finally found a use for Keanu Reeves: Placeholder. This is a relatively watchable action/revenge picture with a title character that could have as easily been portrayed by a cereal box as an actor. <br/><br/>The good news is Reeves makes a great cereal box. He doesn't have to speak, and barely has to act. <br/><br/>The mood and style of the picture are well accomplished, and the plot is straight linear: widower, retired hit man John Wick is out for revenge on the Russian mob punk who stole his car and killed his dog. Since Reeves is at his best when he is not speaking, there is plenty of time for him to slaughter a boatload of Russian mobsters in pursuit of said revenge. And the actions scenes are well executed. (Pun intended.)<br/><br/>The film is enhanced by some well placed characters, well crafted by fine actors. Ian MchShane, Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, and Dean Winters all turn in well drawn, interesting and amusing characters whenever there is a break in the action. Bridget Moynihan plays Wick's flashback wife in a kind of gratuitous cameo. Not much to do for her, though what little she has to work with is done well.<br/><br/>There is already talk of John Wick becoming a ""franchise.""The producers might do well to take a cue from the Bond films and rotate the role of the title character. There are plenty of actors out there who can actually act.<br/><br/>In the meantime, this debut is damn good fun."

We are asked to consider him the hero even though he murders nearly everybody he comes into contact with, usually by shooting them in the head (sometimes multiple times, just for good measure).

When the film gets emotional, Reeves is absolutely believable and you feel the hurt his character is going through.<br/><br/>One of the things this film did that made it great is how realistic it is. John Wick actually runs out of bullets throughout the movie, which is something you don't see a lot in action films. They also build up the characters really well.

"eric262003","9","3","7","30 November 2015"," Excellent Movie In All The Right Places
","Even though Hollywood gets badly ostracized by the masses (including me) there comes a time when every now and then, it brings a surprisingly great film and ""John Wick"" clearly personifies that Hollywood doesn't always turn in money-wasting films. ""John Wick"" combines great solid action, with awesome visuals, subtle humour and provides something quite refreshing to the traditional action film. When first seeing this film I did have my doubts about it because of the formulaic stereotypes it has in this genre, but it didn't really bother me at all because I was enthralled by the visuals. And then I looked at who the scriptwriter is and I sighed because it was written by Derek Koldstad, who's been writing convoluted script for straight to DVD vehicles for Dolph Lundgren. And finally I checked in to see who directed it was by Chad Stahelski, a former stuntman who had some assistance from another stuntman, Davis Leitch. Whatever it was they did, it worked and I give my hats off to them for their efforts to bring something new to the table. <br/><br/>From the opening scenes, the clichés come right to us without any denial. Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, an ex-hit-man trying to get away from it all (like we've seen before). His wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) who has helped him break free from his old ways is now dying of a lingering progressive disease. In return she has left him an adorable little puppy so that he can remain the better man he's become. But then evil remorseless gangsters steal his car and kills his puppy like it was all in a day's work. What was dumb about these gangsters is they refused to do background checks as to which assassin they are dealing with. For the animal sensitive viewer, the scene was not entirely graphic, but it will make you hate the bad guys even more, like what's expected of a film like this. What makes matters worse is that the car is a 1969 Mustang. So therefore revenge is not optional here, it must be done, bar none.<br/><br/>Even though he's been called down by the critics, but Keanu Reeves stars here and here he has succeeded in shutting up all those who have condemned him in the past. He was amazing here and may have exceeded his performances in ""The Matrix"" series. To me it feels like a new awakening for Keanu at 51 and is now making those who maligned him, to eat crow. What could I say? 50 is the new 40 and he never looked better.<br/><br/>What really blew my mind about ""John Wick"" are the action scenes which are truly mesmerizing. The way they executed on screen was original being that it was subtle and not as campy or cartoon- like. The choreography was spot on and the fight scenes looked and felt authentic and convincingly deadly. The brutality and violence truly will get your heart pumping, and it'll hurt just thinking about it.<br/><br/>The fight scenes offer up new elements and inventive in its delivery. But the cinematography is something about ""John Wick"" which can't be neglected. The colours of grey and brown offer a retro feeling reminiscent to the 1950's noir films with a modern twist to it. Set in New York City as a picturesque fantasy landscape your grandparents in the 1950's may have imagined what the Big Apple would look like today which even includes a ritzy hotel like The Continental, which is a facility for refuge, a social club and a relaxing centre for those who commit felonies. That' better then what we expected for underworld crime bosses who hang out in dilapidated apartments where they're gambling their fortunes with their beer mugs and ashtrays, therefore a place like The Continental looks like a better hangout spot for these guys. It has a bit of a ""Sin City"" thing going for it only more grounded and more real. With a sequel coming out I'll surely be the first at my ticket stand. <br/><br/>""John Wick"" has truly resurrected the action genre. It's brutal, violent and and no holds barred a gritty R-rated film that's not afraid to deliver or offend. It may have clichés, but once you seen the movie you'll forget all about the clichés."

","John Wick (2014) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>After the death of his beloved wife, former hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) comes out of retirement when a Russian mobster's son breaks into his home, steals his car and kills his dog, which was a gift from his deceased wife. Soon the mobster (Michael Nyqvist) puts a contract out on Wick's life knowing that he's coming for revenge.<br/><br/>JOHN WICK isn't a film that is going to be studied in film schools and it's certainly not going to be for those seeking ""high art"" or ""meaning"" in their movies. No, JOHN WICK is a terrific throwback to the crazy martial art flicks from the 70s. I couldn't help but watch this film and think of someone like Sunny Chiba in the STREET FIGHTER series. This film here is, of course, a lot more friendly to today's times as it contains non-stop bloody violence as it appears Wick just loves head shots.<br/><br/>The film works so well for a couple of reasons with the first being that this character really fits Reeves style. By now we shouldn't expect too much for Reeves. Often times he sleepwalks through his roles with that laid back approach of his but that quiet nature actually works extremely well for this character. That certain coldness Reeves brings to the film works tremendously well as you can't help but root for him and cheer each time one of the bad guys fall. Nyqvist is also very good in his role as the Russian mobster and he too makes you believe his character. Willem Dafoe is also fun in his supporting role.<br/><br/>The film manages to have some nice style and especially during the action sequences. There's no question that this here is one of the most violent action pictures in recent years with the action scenes containing a great amount of attention to detail but they're played out so well that it almost seems like you're watching a video game. Most of the gunshots, and there are hundreds, are in the bloody to extremely bloody range but the film is just so much fun that even those who don't normally like that type of stuff should be able to still have fun. JOHN WICK certainly isn't the work of Orson Welles but it's not trying to be. It's goal was to be a bad ass action film and it succeeds at that."
"hobgoblinlol","9","3","7","13 August 2015"," Best movie of 2014
","Now, I saw this movie couple of months ago and finally decided to review it. Going in, I thought this was going to be another average, forgetful, one-time film just like most modern movies are, but boy, was I wrong. This movie restored my hope in action movies and broke the monotony that film industry has become for the last 3 - 4 years. <br/><br/>I haven't watched a recent movie more than one time for the last three years at least, I watched John Wick 3 times on the other hand which really says something. The thing is that, now days, movies have become business, they have become overabundant and unmemorable, as soon as the movie is released hype dies away and the movie is forgotten, but John Wick finally did something different that reminded of good old times of early 2000's. This movie will be remembered like Collateral and other modern classics. <br/><br/>The action is perfect, not to mention, the thing I loved the most is that the world John Wick created, the underworld/syndicate of John Wick is just so intriguing and interesting. Makes you want more, and it definitely made me want a sequel or a prequel. Keanu Reeves did an amazing job depicting the character. The background characters in this movie were also very well written in my opinion and I just love the fact about how revered John Wick is in the movie. The soundtrack is also really good. <br/><br/>The movie itself may not be a masterpiece of the decade, but it is a great action flick with a lot of work and thought put into it. It's a hope for the movie industry. <br/><br/>9/10 because this really made me happy and filled me with hope. I rather watch 20 minutes of John Wick than watch another typical Marvel or a superhero brainwashing. Thank you, John Wick for restoring my hope in movies."
"lediscipledessocrates","7","3","7","2 August 2015"," Nobody does it better Mr. Reeves.
","Keanu Reeves reprises his role as a suave and chillingly cold human annihilator in this flick. The movie has been directed by Chad Stahelski , a stunt coordinator and stuntman having contributed his talent and professional services in movies like The Matrix , Van Helsing, Point Break, Die Hard 4.0 , Rambo (a Burma) etc. <br/><br/>In view of the above it is abundantly clear and painfully obvious that John Wick features impressive action scenes, well oiled stunts and fairly violent imagery. As is the case with with most Keanu Reeves filcks, the movie has a dark and an almost grimy feel to it. <br/><br/>The story however is fairly straightforward much unlike The Matrix (which I consider to be a huge relief, since unintelligible plots are overrated) . It is a revenge saga and employs some very typical elements to accommodate a lavish quantum of bullets and blood .<br/><br/>The soundtrack is impressive and adds zing to the pace of the movie . Talking about pace, the movie is not very slow but some sequences seem stretched , which is really surprising given the short run time of the movie (barely 100 minutes). But the action is well directed and hence we can overlook this blemish.<br/><br/>It is an entertaining action movie devoid of any psychological complexity or ""grey"" areas. If you are a Reeves fan do watch it for he has done a good job in this movie as well. The tags I would would like to see in this movie are Cold/Dark/Suave/Reeves-of course."
"almosalami","9","3","7","24 July 2015"," This movie has such awesome style, such an awesome world
","I'd like to spend this review addressing the complaints people have put up.<br/><br/>1- John Wick gets knocked out by a bunch of thugs even though he's an unbelievable badass.<br/><br/>He has been retired for 4 years, in the same house, preoccupied by his new dog, after being waken up from sleep, in the absolute dark. Whatever level of skill you have, that's absolutely acceptable. In fact, it would've not made sense if he actually was able to stop them - then maybe those giving negative reviews would've pointed out how THAT was absurd. He even admits, after being questioned by the guy at the club saying he was ""rusty"", and throughout the film, we see mentions of him getting back to form, getting back to his previous life.<br/><br/>2- John Wick goes after them ""just for a dog"" OK, aside from the fact that a dog lover can get pretty attached to a dog, especially at the stage of the dog still being a helpless puppy, and aside from the fact that the act of killing that puppy to ""shut him the dog up"" is pretty freaken disgusting, aside from the fact that John Wick even addresses it in the film saying that this dog was the last gift from his late wife and it made him feel like he wasn't alone in the world, aside from all that, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A FREAKEN CRAZY BADASS MAFIA Hit-man/ASSASSIN. DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN WALK UP TO A GUY LIKE THAT, KILL HIS DOG, AND EXPECT HIM TO JUST LEAVE IT ALONE?! Do you see the context here! I mean for God's sake! 3- John Wick never misses a shot, but when it comes to killing that son, he misses 5 shots in a row.<br/><br/>Would you give that a rest. Yeah, it's a stretch, but the movie would've ended right there, and honestly, I think I was too busy with the awesome action, incredible music, and sleek style of everything, things like that can easily be forgiven.<br/><br/>4- How has the kid of Viggo not heard of John Wick when seemingly everybody has heard of John Wick? Did you see the kid? He doesn't seem like the guy who likes to think too much of anything, and given the way his father distanced himself from him, along with the fact that the kid looks pretty young (so 4 years before, he would've not been completely aware of the exact business going on with his father) as well as how there is a WHOLE WORLD OF PEOPLE IN THIS, it seems fair.<br/><br/>5- Bad acting The only scene I really noticed the acting dropped was at the very end, with the admittedly cheesy ""No more bullets."" Is that the only thing you're referring to? If so, then bloody hell, there's a whole 90+ minutes to the film, most of which was action, so why are you even mentioning the acting as if this was some romantic drama where the acting is the main aspect of the film.<br/><br/>6- Bad dialogue Yeah, this I just don't get. There were some pretty nice dialogue sections, and so much of the film was world-building, I mean, how often do you see this in a film done at this level? 7- Action was just a rip-off of other films Yeah, shooting a gun is totally a rip-off. Sure. Let's go with that.<br/><br/>8- Lack of character development I severely have to disagree on that. Through the great world-building, we see these characters coming in and they all fit very nicely in this universe, that with that alone, you get the needed characterization. Furthermore, on John Wick himself, through his interaction with other characters, his past, his amazing skill, you get plenty of characterization, and thinking about it, what scene would you have taken out of the film to replace with 'character development'? Cuz anything added to the film and it would've felt longer than it needed to be.<br/><br/>9- Not much of a story here.<br/><br/>This movie does hit a lot of clichés in, and there isn't some big moral lesson to take home or commentary on the life of gangsters and mobsters, but really, who was walking into this expecting a great story? And for those who did, this isn't that kind of film where the story takes primary presence in the film. In my mind, there are action films that are meant for awesome stylistic action, and there are those that are meant to tell a great story told through some thrilling action here and there. Very rarely do you 'hit two birds with one stone' in these kinds of films, and the films that try that end up not being able to balance the two and ultimately fail story-wise. So it's a good thing that this film didn't try for too much of a story, because that would've detracted from what the film was actually good at. And really, the story made up for itself with the world-building.<br/><br/>10- HOW SO EVER CAN I TRUST IMDb AGAIN?! OH MY! Really? Really? This is the film that made you distrust IMDb ratings? REALLY?!"
"kstephens17","9","3","7","14 July 2015"," A lot like Boondock Saints, but John Wick works alone
","John Wick does exactly what it sets out to do, it entertains those of us who appreciate action-packed films. The storyline is simple, the cinematography is close to perfection, and the soundtrack matches seamlessly. John Wick is a man of few words and Keanu Reeves plays him so well that we get a thorough understanding of his character even though he remains silent for a majority of his scenes. To those who insist on complaining about the gratuitous violence in this movie, John Wick is about a Hit Man out for REVENGE. I can't imagine that the Mafia's ""Boogeyman"" would go about getting revenge by calling the cops or hiring a lawyer to sue the gang that took everything he loved from him?! To those who are complaining about the lack of realism, John Wick isn't based in reality, people as bad-ass as him don't exist in the real world, nor does a Secret Society of Assassins, so complaining that the movie should have explained the inner workings of the Continental is absurd. For those of us who were actually paying attention instead of pointing out all the ""flaws"" in the film, we don't need the inner workings of the Continental or its members explained to us because the premise was so glaringly obvious. To those who think that a legend like John should have been able to fend off the attack at the start of the film, I will admit that John Wick does get his ass kicked at the start of the film and yes, maybe a legend such as himself should have been able to defend himself, but you're all missing some very important points, he had no idea that the attack was coming, he was sleeping a minute before the attack, and he had been retired for more than 5 years. I doubt he was expecting an ambush when he was simply getting up to get his puppy some food. Expecting that his guard would still be up 5 years after he had retired would be unrealistic, not to mention, there wouldn't have been a movie at all if he had killed all the bad guys within the first 10 minutes of the film. The fact that he comes out of retirement to avenge the death of his puppy shows us exactly why he's so feared. To those who think that the Mob Boss's (Viggo) son Losef should have known who John Wick was, Wick had been retired for 5 years, which means that Losef would have still been a teen when Wick helped his father, which also means that they parted on good terms, so there was no reason for Viggo to fear John until Losef crossed him. Part of Wick's retirement likely included allowing him to keep a low profile, having him outed at every turn would have ruined any chance he had at a normal life and if John is the legend they all say he is, I doubt any of his old acquaintances wanted to be known as the person who prevented him from achieving happiness, need I remind you that he came out of retirement to avenge his puppy? Finally, to those who think it's unrealistic to expect that assassins can be loyal to each other, you missed the whole purpose of the Continental. Clearly, in the fictional world that is John Wick, Assassins live by a particular code that includes not killing your friends, which explains why Marcus was willing to protect John. Unlike, Ms. Perkins, John and Marcus live by the code and respect each other enough not to let money get in the way of their friendship or the rules. This point is illustrated clearly when Ms. Perkins' fate is sealed after she breaks the rules."
"davidgee","4","3","7","18 April 2015"," Mindless mayhem
","The theft of his car and the killing of his dog provide the motivation for an orgy of shootings and beatings. There's even a fight scene with a hit-woman, so that misogynists can get their jollies. Keanu Reeves obviously has bills - or alimony - to pay, which could explain his appearance in this schlock. Did Jason Statham and Nicholas Cage turn it down? Willem Dafoe, presumably also in need of a boost to his pension, has an inexplicable supporting role, and Ian McShane makes an appearance so brief it can't have paid much more than Extra work.<br/><br/>The film is shot with pace and style, but the mayhem is endless, pointless, mindless. I normally avoid movies as bad as this; I should have avoided JOHN WICK."
"stephendaxter","8","3","7","12 February 2015"," An intense return to form for both the action genre and Keanu Reeves
","I will start by saying i haven't really been a fan of many strictly action films that have come out in the last 5 - 7 years, until now. John Wick is a mostly well paced action film with many really awesome and intense action sequences that actually really surprised me. This film i feel just revived the action genre, well for me it did. It was so fun to watch while at the same time getting increasingly more interesting the more twists the film took. One thing i also loved was that once the action begins, it doesn't really take many breaks, it just keeps going with fight after fight and not one bit of action felt forced, it all made sense in terms of the plot. Lets talk about the plot, at first this movie seems like your average action film about someone who gets something taken from him and seeks revenge. But that quickly unfolds to reveal more and more secrets about who John Wick is and who the people he is hunting are. <br/><br/>The movie felt like to me a perfect mix between 'Taken' and 'Hostel' making for a surprisingly awesome action film. In terms of the performances, i felt that everyone in this film portrayed their characters really well, in a way that felt pretty believable. But the most importantly, this felt like a real comeback to the action genre for Keanu Reeves, he was incredible in this movie, right from the beginning you are really backing his character and are cheering him on right to the end. I believe he can really take over from Liam Neeson and be the new face of badass action if only this film got the attention it deserved. The only issue i felt stood out was that the third act of the film although was still very entertaining and intense felt a little more rushed than the rest of the film. But other than that this film was a very pleasant surprise and restored my faith in the action genre. I love the world they set up in this film and cant wait for the sequel or any other films they decide to set within this world. - 8.1"

","Mob hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) promised his wife he would quit the business and he does so for 5-years. Then she dies and for him not to be alone she had arranged for a Beagle puppy delivered to him at home. Then the son of mob boss Viggio (Michael Nyqvist) - who John Wick used to work for - wants his car ( a souped-up 1969 Mustang ) beats him up and kills the puppy. John Wick recovers and knows what he has to do. Let the games begin. <br/><br/>Most hit-man stories have the hit-man (or a narrator) tell about his life and the specific numbered rules he lives by. And during the time of the movie, we will see this hit-man break every rule he has. This time it's different. This time it's pure revenge. We don't know the rules John Wick used to live by. But make no mistake about all this, now John Wick is out to make things righthis way (get chills saying that?).<br/><br/>To be clear we learn that everyone, including Viggio, is afraid of John Wick, but Viggio must protect his son from John Wick. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is a well-orchestrated choreography of gun fights. Some special effects regarding vehicles are included and are quite good. The cinematography in this gun-fest is also quite good. The music is non-stop heart pounding throughout. <br/><br/>Hit-man Marcus (Willem Dafoe) is contracted by Viggio to take out John Wick. This is insurance in case Viggio's men don't get the job done. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is the right actor for this movie. As John Wick, he doesn't talk much but his stares speak volumes (don't forget his guns too). In fact, I have always seen Keanu Reeves as the right actor for any movie he is in. After his character's beating when the car and the dog were gone I felt his pain and loss. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much.<br/><br/>Rating: B"

","Every so often two movies are released the same calendar year with a similar story—ala Dante's Peak and Volcano, both released in 1997, Deep Impact and Armageddon in 1998, The Illusionist and The Prestige in 2006, Olympus has Fallen and White House Down in 2013 or we can go all the way back to 1984 with Breakin' and Beat Street. I mention this because part way through this movie I couldn't help but realize how eerily similar it is to The Equalizer.<br/><br/>The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, was about a retired, highly skilled agent that was living alone because he had lost his wife. He was drawn out of retirement by the Russian Mafia because of their iniquities.<br/><br/>John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves, is about a retired, highly skilled assassin that lives alone because he lost his wife. He has also been drawn out of retirement by Russians because of their iniquities. That's where the similarities end. Even though John Wick is a good movie I give the nod to The Equalizer over it for a few reasons: <br/><br/>1.) Denzel over Keanu. Reeves still has all of the range of a cardboard cutout.<br/><br/>2.) The story. Every vengeance/vigilante film requires an impetus for the revenge/vigilantism. Sometimes we, the viewer, don't really care what that reason is, we just want to see some professional butt whipping. Even if that is the case, that's not to say that some causes are not better than others. The cause in John Wick was good just how it came about was very elementary.<br/><br/>3.) The head scratching moments. John Wick has three moments that leave you scratching your head with a puzzled look on your face. They are fairly obvious as they are right out of the movie cliché manual. It doesn't cripple the movie but it makes you wonder: in this day and age with a hundred years of movies to refer to, why drum up the same old good guy and bad guy clichés?<br/><br/>Those are my only beefs. They aren't enough to ruin the movie well, they might ruin it for some. Once the action kicks into gear it's a real treat. John Wick is masterful with a gun. It's like he took martial arts classes with guns. Instead of giving you a well-placed punch or kick, he uses bullets. And there was something they did well in this movie which I'd never seen in a movie before this one. John Wick had to often, and quite obviously, change magazines in his weapons. John Wick made it very apparent that his guns do not have magazines with unlimited rounds, and that you very well may have to replace a magazine at a very inconvenient time. That was refreshing."

","How can I describe the movie John Wick in comparison to other action films, average at best, more mediocre than average. This movie starts of very strong, with a plot that seems like it is about to elevate this movie into something more than just another action flick. It almost looks like it will delve into that rarely seen realm of an action flick with a decent story. Then it gets about halfway through and becomes so very predictable and rather boring. I rarely use the word boring even describing average to mediocre action films but that is exactly what happens to this movie about halfway through. How can a movie full of action be boring is something the people who made this film should ponder. I cannot really blame the cast as they all were pretty good in their roles, the story was just straight booty after the halfway point. This is a prime example of a movie that should have ended like 40 minutes prior to when it did. When the main character achieved his goal is when it should have ended but the just had to add on another 40- 60 minutes of movie which just made everything up to that point seem like a wasted effort. Shame on the writers, directors, financiers, and all the behind the scenes magic that made this movie for not realizing this movie was headed into the absurd realm sooner. You would be better suited spending your cash on almost ANY other movie at the box office this weekend if you insist on seeing this film. The saddest part of this is that Keanu Reeves (and all the cast) actually did some pretty good acting in this film, not his usual phoning it in. Anybody who says this movie is more than a below average action movie is not somebody who has seen the movie or a person with poor film taste."

There really isn't much to the film. This is just a straight up, R-rated, ultra-violent shoot 'em up with some great action sequences. I love how the characters run out of bullets and have to reload during a fight. Stuff like that make the film funny at times amid all the head shots and blood.

","Before I decided to give this movie a go, I was doubtful if Reeves could entertain me for (almost) two hours. Certainly did not like his last string of movies. I decided to give John Wick (and more: Keanu Reeves) a try. I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Though director Chad Stahelski sure knows his action flick clichés, the film doesn't fall for the trap of one dimensional characters and tries original takes on standard action movie situations. Well done. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie is also saved by a carefully chosen cast and great supporting roles: small but humble roles played by former The Wire actors (Lance Reddick, Clarke Peters) and Willem Dafoe for once as a good guy makes sense. Michael Nyqvist does a great performance as sympathetic but evil bad guy boss Viggo Tarasov and Alfie Allen (singer Lilly Allen's brother and well known for his role as Theon Greyjoy) is the guy you love to hate Ioseph Tarasov.<br/><br/>This stylish, cool movie is a perfect fit for Keanu Reeves, who's style of acting works best in movies where he doesn't have to show too much emotions. Didn't even notice his Californian 'Bill & Ted accent' this time around that ruined some movies for me in which he played (Much ado about Nothing for example: a surfer dude playing in a Shakespeare play)"

While I did not check this out in IMAX, I was very glad I saw it and may even see it again. A simple, non convoluted plot with simple characters, simple motives. Characters you root for, characters you despise. John (Keanu) is an emotionally burdened man in which you can sense the heaviness of his burdens in his eyes, yet that's as much as he will let you in, as the rest of his angst is transformed into pre- meditated vengeance extracted upon the culprits who have done him harm. They should have finished the job, as the debt they started quickly becomes more than they, or the whole organization can afford. John Wick is a lethal, precise assassin and while it doesn't necessarily look like he is having fun while doing it, it certainly is fun to watch."

I was so overjoyed that it rests in the action sequences, the lovable hero played gloriously by K.Reeves as a the somber, stoic ""bad-good guy,"" and continuing our disdain for Russians (*see Cold War*) No, it is simply a revenge action movie, and the scenes are totally bad-arse. The ""insights"" to this crazy underworld of hired-killers is original, insightful, and adds depth to an otherwise ""go get em"" kinda movie.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT - there's a scene so sad (the beginning) that it makes you want to cry and adds fire to your furious revenge nestled in your heart."

","""John Wick"" is another fast-paced and graphic revenge movie with some entertaining action and black humour, a fitting soundtrack and the usual stereotypical characters from the Russian mafia. When it comes to gripping revenge flicks, you should rather watch South Korean movies like the intense ""The Man from Nowhere"" which is twice as good as this film, ""I Saw the Devil"" which is probably one of the most brutal movies ever made, the emotionally heart-breaking ""Blood Island"", as well as the philosophical trilogy around ""Sympathy for Mister Vengeance"", ""Oldboy"" and ""Lady Vengeance"" if you are looking for some originality, depth and character development. ""John Wick"" is only a hollow entertainment for genre fans. If I wasn't a fan of this kind of movies, my rating would be much lower than it is.<br/><br/>The story is simple. John Wick was a hit-man working for the organized crime in New York City. He retired from his job and started a new life when he met the love of his life. Roughly four years later, John Wick loses his wife to cancer. He receives a posthumous gift from her in form of a puppy with a letter from his wife saying that she is gone and that John Wick should cope with her demise by loving the dog. Coincidentally, he encounters the son of his old boss who doesn't know him. The young Russian mafioso wants to purchase John Wick's vintage '69 Mustang but the grieving man refuses. A few hours later, the Russian mafioso breaks into John Wick's house without any problems as there seems to be no alarm system at all. With a few friends, the young criminal kills John Wick's beloved puppy, steals his car and is bright enough to take off his hood to show his face so John Wick surely knows who he is. The victim survives and goes on to kill around eighty criminals in the next ninety minutes of the movie. Of course, killing the naive culprit is not enough, he also kills his partners, colleagues, bodyguards, his old boss and a few guys in a church. In the end, everybody but John Wick is dead and he goes to the next veterinary hospital, walks off with a new dog and goes home as if nothing ever happened.<br/><br/>This story is so bad that it could have been written by a twelve-year old. First of all, there are too many coincidences concerning the encounter with the Russian criminals who want to steel John Wick's car. In the entire movie, everybody is talking about John Wick's incredible reputation and everybody knows him wherever he goes but the son of the most influent criminal is the only one who has never heard of him. It's not credible that a smart hit-man doesn't have any alarm system to protect his home. One can understand that the killing of the puppy his wife gave to him really hurts John Wick but taking this event to justify eighty or more murders is not credible at all. In the entire movie, there is no police or anything despite all the shootings in downtown New York City. All of John Wick's enemies are extremely stupid, unexperienced and wooden. Even thirty men in one building can't manage to fight him. I could go on for hours as this movie is filled with so many coincidences, plot holes and unrealistic scenes that it's amusing. If you tell me know that the story doesn't matter in a revenge action movie, just watch any of the movies mentioned in the introduction that prove that even the grisliest revenge thriller can have some depth. Even ""The Raid"" franchise is more realistic and has better plots. ""John Wick"" rather feels like a simplistic ego-shooter for video game consoles than an actual movie. I must though admit that the last Splinter Cell games had better story lines than this film.<br/><br/>Another thing that feels out of place is the fact that fifty-year old Keanu Reeves is playing the unbeatable hit-man. The fighting scenes are somewhat wooden but he still manages to fight off his enemies because their acting is even slower. On the other side, Keanu Reeves also has a certain charisma to fit this role. Fifty-nine year old Willem Dafoe as veteran hit-man who has to kill John Wick is also a questionable choice in my opinion. Still, he is a respectable actor and has charisma. The most annoying thing is the fact that the evil guys are Russians again but that they are portrayed by actors from all around the world like England, Sweden and even Switzerland - except Russia. One can feel that these are wannabe Hollywood Russians and not real Russians.<br/><br/>You may now ask yourself why I still gave a favourable rating to this flick. It's actually simple. This movie never gets boring. The action scenes are sometimes wooden but most of them are just shootings so it doesn't really matter. These scenes are well directed and include no annoying shaky cameras or overloaded special effects. The settings of the movie are well chosen and vary from dirty chop shops over elegant bath houses to Orthodox churches. There are a few memorable lines in this film as in many other action movies. Some graphic content is related to some dark and dry humour which made the whole thing easier to digest. I actually liked this combination of contradictory extremes and had to laugh quite a few times during the movie. The soundtrack of the movie is also enjoyable and fitting. For genre fans, there are enough entertaining and well-executed elements to enjoy this movie despite its obvious flaws.<br/><br/>If you are looking for some fast-paced and superficial entertainment to switch your brains off, you will like ""John Wick"". If you are actually looking for a good movie that has more to offer than stylish violence, go for the movies mentioned in the introduction."

","If ever there is a real movement to curb the excess of violence in films, this should be the standard to show as an example.<br/><br/>There is enough shooting and other forms of violence all over the place including dance halls, the church, on the street, you name it.<br/><br/>The story in itself gets lost with all the violence that takes place. Everyone is screaming and running around while the guns are absolutely blazing.<br/><br/>When a killer's wife dies, Keanu Reeves, the grief stricken widower, is soon robbed of his car and his beloved dog put to death by the son of a fellow gangster. As a result, all hell breaks loose and nothing is spared.<br/><br/>This is nothing more than an overly violent film showing what killers do each other when the other is affected."

I actually made an account just to tell everyone not to listen to the bad reviews for a second. If you like Beast mode dude kills all the bad guys action movies then you will love this movie! I give it a 10 out of 10 because for what it is....... It's damn near flawless. Very violent and brutal action scenes and Keanu is an absolute beast in this. I read one review saying this was a comedy and just to clarify that there is almost zero humor in the movie. Keanu is calm and just professional as can be almost the whole movie. Minus the accent he almost reminded me of Jean Reno in the professional. Overall if your a fan of action watch this movie with confidence and some of the people on here shouldn't watch a movie from a genre they don't like and then talk about how bad the movie was. Obviously if you hate scifi or fantasy movies and you go see lord of the rings your not gonna like it but to anyone with an open mind even slightly loves it.

","The best thing about John Wick are the action sequences because after a while they resemble a modern ballet piece. Otherwise, the plot is worthy of a comic book or a first person video game.<br/><br/>So, the main character goes after Russian mob because some of their less intelligent members stole his car and shot his dog. Yes, this is his motivation to turn the rest of the movie into a gore fest. We'll also encounter an underworld of hired assassins that not only have code of conduct and well established hideouts, but also their own currency resembling a gold coin. It's net worth remains ambiguous since for one coin you might enter a club but also dispose of a body by a professional service.<br/><br/>The biggest question mark i had about John Wick is what made Keanu Reeves play in this movie. Was it the fading fame, his agents talking him into it or complementary fitness lessons that came with the role.<br/><br/>Funny enough, roughly at the same time with John Wick release a similar trashy movie came out, with an underdog fighting the Russian mafia, namely The Equalizer with Denzel Washington."

The lore is presented in an organic way and it has some mystique to it, which is hard to find.

","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a bad-ass: an ex-hit-man who comes out of retirement after the son of a Russian mafia boss steals his car and kills his dog (a parting gift from his dead wife). Busting out his weaponry, Wick cuts a bloody swathe through countless bad guys en route to his target, always finishing with a shot to the head.<br/><br/>The problem is that Wick is TOO much of a bad-ass. At no point did I feel like he was in real danger. Even after receiving a gash to the stomach the size of my fist and taking a severe beating, Wick makes Liam Neeson in Taken look like a pussy, escaping every situation with a flurry of fists and feet and umpteen carefully aimed rounds. It's as though he doesn't feel pain. It's hard to feel a genuine sense of excitement knowing that our hero (if a ruthless killer can be called a hero) is virtually indestructible.<br/><br/>The action is well staged, and the level of violence is high enough to please many fans of the action genre, but I was left feeling more than a little empty. In fact, I was hoping that Wick would die at the end to finally be reunited with his wife (and his dog), but seeing as there is already a John Wick 2, the chances of that happening seemed quite low.<br/><br/>5.5/10, rounded down for the novelty subtitles.

","Keanu Reeves does what he does best as the titular John Wick, a retired hit-man forced to revisit his old life to seek retribution against the Russian underworld following a tragic encounter. Very soon, those that have wronged him learn very fast that they have made a grave mistake.<br/><br/>John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a retired hit-man living the simple life with his puppy Daisy that was given to him to cope with the loss of his wife Helen (Bridget Moynihan) who passed away following a terminal illness. John Wick is left for dead following an encounter with a group of Russian mobsters led by the arrogant and selfish Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) who also rob him of his prized vintage 1969 Ford Mustang and brutally kill Daisy. Swearing vengeance, John Wick digs out his arsenal of weapons to leave no stone unturned in New York City to track down Iosef who is also the son of the feared Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). It goes without saying that the bullets fly fast and anyone who stands in the way of John Wick are quickly dispatched. Former allies and enemies are also revisited to help or hinder John Wick's quest for revenge including Aurelio (John Leguizamo), Marcus (Willem Dafoe), Winston (Ian McShane), Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki), and Harry (Clarke Peters).<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves has always been a likable actor and he has always been a pleasure to watch in a wide variety of memorable films such as Point Break (1991), Little Buddha (1993), Speed (1994), The Devil's Advocate (1997) and The Matrix (1999). Although some of his other films can be hit-and-miss, John Wick launches him back to the big time doing what he does best. Although Keanu Reeves was 49 years of age at the time of filming, he puts a lot of younger actors to shame doing his own stunts and embarking on a physical regime of martial arts and weapons training. Check out the clip on YouTube where Keanu Reeves brilliantly showcases his marksmanship abilities on the gun range.<br/><br/>The supporting cast including Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe do well in their respective roles but it is Keanu Reeves who is the main star of the movie who shines very well in the titular role.<br/><br/>The stylish slam bang action packed entertainment does not stop from start to finish and it's good to see Keanu Reeves return for the sequel just released in 2017.<br/><br/>Action fans should not miss this one.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","4","23 March 2017"," ""John Wick"" takes all the clichés of this kind of story and turns them into gold
","In theory, ""John Wick"" shouldn't work. It's ""Taken"" with Keanu Reeves. It's the ""let's create a middle-aged action hero with unrivaled skills whose first name starts with J"" formula. And yet, director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad take the very best of that formula and elevate it into art – undoubtedly one of the best American-made pure action movies of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves fits so effortlessly into this story as John Wick, a former hit-man who has just lost his wife to an illness. After having a random encounter with the son of a crime lord he once worked for, the young man decides to target Wick and attacks him in his home. More significantly, he commits one particular crime that pushes Wick over the emotional brink and back into the criminally underbelly from which he thought he'd walked away forever. <br/><br/>The emotional plot device that launches this story out of canon might seem a little cheap, but it works powerfully well. In a way, Kolstad knows that we know the ""retired hero steps back into the ring"" trope so well, that he manipulates it to his advantage. We get behind our new anti-hero in a heartbeat. The cherry on that sundae comes in a one- word line of dialogue from crime lord Vigo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) when learns just who his son (Alfie Allen) has messed with: ""Oh.""<br/><br/>The body of the film is R-rated bloody mayhem that combines martial arts with a shoot 'em up style, which results in a surprisingly satisfying combination punctuated by a plethora of kill shots to the head, a phrase I never thought I'd use in a movie review. The sound effects and spraying blood dust echo video game sequences; in fact, there's a scene in which Wick assaults a safe house that's cut with a guy in the safe house playing a first-person shooter game. It's a nice, well-executed and majorly self-aware juxtaposition.<br/><br/>Stahelski also brings a graphic novel aesthetic to the film. There's a lot of careful shot composition and a dark color palette with different colored hues. The way he stitches together two scenes -- one of Vigo lecturing his son about his terrible mistake and the other of Wick going into his basement to dig up the weapons he's buried – has a distinct comic book vibe.<br/><br/>Reeves has the perfect amount of quiet, determined menace to bring the part to life, but ""John Wick"" also drew some impressive talent in other venerated actors between Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo and Ian McShane. They lend so much legitimacy to the criminal fantasy world of ""The Hotel.""<br/><br/>If all that weren't enough, the script does circle around some ideas about whether a person can change. As much forward thrust as the opening scenes give this film, Kolstad doesn't settle with it. It digs a little deeper into what really motivated John to get back in the business and proposes it might have been inevitable.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" is a successful combination of style and storytelling, and it really elevates the very basic genre-level appeal of this type of action movie. It's unusual for a movie to be one of the last ones to the party (this party being all the films about middle-aged assassins seeking revenge) and be the one to make the biggest impression. That's the sign of a great action movie.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading. Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more."

Since then in order to get ready for the sequel, I re watched this and was generally surprised. <br/><br/>This film has a feel of an old school 80-90's action flick using wide shots instead of shaky cam for the action and I love it, every action scene works to its advantage and showed how capable these directors are. Keanu Reeves is in my opinion an underrated actor that should get more respect, and I'm glad that he got a lot of praise for this film cause he deserves it. I don't want to shortchange the rest of the cast because they are also really good including Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Alfie Allen, Michael Nyquist, Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe and etc. Palicki and Nyquist are the biggest surprises to me especially since I wasn't a big fan of either of them, but they both surprised me in the end.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, John Wick is of the best revenge films that I've seen in a while, this film and its sequel should be lessons to producers of Hollywood in how to make an action film and how they should make them from now on."
"jekyllgrim","5","2","4","16 October 2016"," Ridiculous action movie trying to be serious
","I could talk for a long time about weak writing, one-dimensional characters and stupid and boring action scenes, but these are the things that simply make this movie bad. What makes it truly ridiculous, however, is its portrayal of Russians and Russian mafia.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I don't mind Russians portrayed as bad guys, it's just one of many action movie clichés that I easily accept. The ridiculous part is, this movie actually tries to focus on Russians while knowing NOTHING about them.<br/><br/>First, let's take John Wick, who is supposed to be a badass hit-man. The mafia calls him Baba Yaga. This fact alone is so hilarious it would send a Russian roll on the floor laughing, because it sounds about as good as calling a badass hit-man ""the Wicked Witch of the East"". Baga Yaga is a folk character mostly known through fairy- tales, she's an old witch who is portrayed as wise, scary and occasionally villainous, but quite often helpful (and she's mostly known from fairy-tales where she's practically never a big villain). ""Baba"" isn't really a part of the name, it simply means ""old hag"". That's right, a badass hit-man called ""old hag"" and a female name. <br/><br/>I assume at some point there was an idea to find a word similar to Boogeyman and use it as a nickname for John. There indeed is a Slavic ""boogeyman"" called Babay which they perhaps confused with Baba Yaga. Boy, how many laughs this confusion produced.<br/><br/>Naturally, not a single character in the movie can speak Russian at all. Plus almost nobody has a real Russian name. I understand that Americans tend to struggle very hard with Russian surnames, but first names? There are no Russians named Iosef, let alone Viggo! The mafia boss looks about as realistic as Boris in Snatch, but Boris was purposefully over-the-top, while John Wick is presented to us like a serious movie.<br/><br/>And there's the hilarious scene in club sauna where Russian mafia guys actually sing Kalinka-Malinka. It's about as stupid as American criminals getting reading Dr Seuss aloud together. In real life there's a whole genre of criminal songs called Blatnyak and in many ways it fulfills the same function as some types of rap; it's songs sung by criminals (or people pretending to be them), for criminals and about criminals. This is something that Russian mafia could actually sing. Not goddamn Russian 19th century songs that were common on Soviet TV!<br/><br/>And I could accept all that, even though it's crazy to see this silliness in 2014, if not for one thing: somehow this movie pretends that it actually is ABOUT Russians. Russians are everywhere, they talk about their thoughts, customs, motivations, et cetera et cetera, while NONE OF THIS has ANYTHING to do with real Russians. This reminds me of a historical museum scene in the movie called ""Idiocracy"" in which future people got so stupid they think that Charlie Chaplin fought with Nazis and dinosaurs that shot lasers. That's how far this movie is from reality, and for the life of me I simply can't understand WHY the authors of this movie tried to talk about things that they literally know nothing about."

The best is his fight with Palicki. It's all amazingly shoot. The simple story is better than most with some nice touches. I do have a couple of small problems with the plot. I don't like that he kept missing Iosef in the hotel because he had shown that he almost never misses. I don't mind not killing Iosef so early. He just needs to scamper away before the shooting starts. I also don't understand why Wick doesn't get reprimanded by the hotel.

","Just when John Wick thought he was out, they pull him back in. It's the tried-and-true formula of one last job/heist/assignment. A longtime bad guy leaves the life of crime in pursuit of peace and quiet, but naturally gets dragged back to his old haunts and habits to settle a final score. But ""John Wick"" breathes exhilarating life into this tired premise, thanks to some dazzling action choreography, stylish visuals and–most importantly–a vintage anti-hero performance from Keanu Reeves. Toward the end of the film, a menacing Russian mobster remarks that the veteran hit man John Wick looks very much like the John Wick of old. Keanu Reeves looks very much like the Keanu Reeves of old, as well. Elegantly handsome and athletically lean, he looks fantastic at 50 and is comfortably, securely back in action-star mode. Not that he's been gone that long– or deviated that much from his persona–but this later-stage butt-kicking does call to mind Liam Neeson's recent resurgence in movies like ""Taken,"" ""The Grey"" and ""Non-Stop."" After all these years, though, he's still quintessentially Keanu. He radiates a Zen-like calm which makes him simultaneously elusive and irresistible, especially in the face of great mayhem. There's still a boyish quality to his face but it belies the wisdom of his years. He's smarter than he looks but he's in no great hurry to go out of his way to prove it to you–at least, not on screen. He just  is. A character like John Wick is right in Reeves' wheelhouse because it allows him to be coolly, almost mythically confident, yet deliver an amusing, deadpan one-liner with detached precision. (This is when traces of the playful characters of his youth–Ted ""Theodore"" Logan and Johnny Utah–take a moment to surface.) But when the time comes–and it comes often in ""John Wick""–he can deliver with a graceful yet powerful physicality. Soon after the death of his wife (Bridget Moynahan)–the woman whose love inspired him to retire from his life as an expert assassin–Wick receives an unwelcome visit to his minimalist, modern mansion in the middle of the night. Russian bad guys have come to steal his prized 1969 Mustang–and they kill his dog in the process. The latter act is horrifying in itself; what's even worse is that the adorable beagle puppy, Daisy, was a posthumous gift to John from his dying wife, who knew he'd need someone else to love. (Moynahan's character, by the way, is barely even a person. She's an image on a smartphone video clip–a body lying in a hospital bed, suffering from an unspecified disease. She's an idea. But her loss provides Wick with a melancholy that lingers over his demeanor and every decision he makes.) Wick wastes no time unearthing his stashed arsenal and seeking revenge. It turns out that the group's reckless, young leader, Iosef (Alfie Allen), is the son of a former associate of Wick's: mob boss Viggo Tarasov (a sophisticated but scary Michael Nyqvist), who is fully aware of Wick's killing capacity. Also in the mix is Willem Dafoe as an expert sniper who may or may not be on Wick's side. Once the premise is established in the script from Derek Kolstad, it's scene after scene of Wick taking out entire rooms full of people who are foolish enough to stand in his way. This is not exactly a complicated genre from a narrative perspective. But directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch–who work as a filmmaking team, although Leitch technically takes producing credit–are both veteran stuntman who clearly know what they're doing when it comes to this kind of balletic action. Stahelski got his break 20 years ago when he served as a stunt double following Brandon Lee's deadly accident while shooting ""The Crow"" and went on to perform as Reeves' stunt double in ""The Matrix"" trilogy. Leitch's work includes doubling for Brad Pitt (in ""Fight Club"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") and Matt Damon (in ""The Bourne Ultimatum""). All those years of experience and exposure give their film a level of confidence you don't ordinarily see in first-time directors. They're smart enough to let the intricate choreography speak for itself. They let the fight scenes play out without relying on a lot of nauseating shaky-cam or Cuisinart edits, which sadly have become the aesthetic standard of late. But beyond the exquisite brutality they put on display, they've also got an eye for artistry, with cinematographer Jonathan Sela helping convey an ominous sense of underworld suspense. Early scenes are so crisply desaturated, they look black and white, from the cloudy, rainy skies over Wick's wife's funeral to his head-to-toe wardrobe to his sleek, slate-gray Mustang. As Wick begins to re-immerse himself in the criminal world he'd escaped, other scenes pop in their vibrancy–the deep green of a secret, members-only cocktail bar, or the rich red of a Russian bad guy's shirt under an impeccably tailored suit. While the body count grows numbing and repetitive, ""John Wick"" actually is more compelling in the aesthetically heightened, specifically detailed world it depicts. It's the New York City of the here and now, but Wick, his fellow assassins and other sundry nefarious sorts occupy their own parallel version of it, with its own peculiar rules which almost seem quaint. They have their own currency: gold coins reminiscent of pirates' doubloons, which can be used for goods and services or just as thanks for a favor. And they frequent an upscale, downtown hotel and bar called The Continental (Lance Reddick from ""The Wire"" is the unflappably polite manager), a sort of safe zone where protocol dictates that peace prevails, and where killing is cause for dismissal. The courtliness of it all provides an amusing and welcome contrast to the non-stop carnage. You can check out any time you'd like, it seems, but you can never leave."

","Keanu Reeves isn't the guy that seems suited for your usual revenge flick, but he works fairy well for ""John Wick"". There's an inherent detachment to Reeves for a good portion of the film, but he's also got that quiet brooding that roils beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Probably the best thing about this movie are the action scenes, which aren't cut to shreds. They're well-staged and have a nice fluid brutality to them. Simple but effective.<br/><br/>What was also really nice was the clearly defined (under)world with its coded language, currency ad protocols. It harked back to ""Payback"" and the mob-as-corporate-culture. Also, Wick had modern dress and domestic appointments (probably due to his departed wife), but he's using an old touchtone phone and getting around in circa '79s cars. Little touches that add character.<br/><br/>It's great news that they're planning a sequel. They've already built the world, and I'm in for more."

And seeing Keanu Reeves kicking ass and taking names is just the bonus. Like I said the plot doesn't have anything that really stands out, but the stylish cinematography, choreography with enough cool action elements make this one worth at least one watch. Especially if you like action movies. However I could see why some audiences would not like this movie and why some people just wouldn't.

","John Wick has a very simple, maybe even laughable plot. It is a typical guy takes his revenge movie. It can be easily summarized as ""Keanu gets pissed and shoots people in the face for 101 minutes"" but the thing is you actually can see it is really Keanu who is doing it. Instead of shaky cameras and dozens of superfast cuts, you can see kick-ass long takes which are amazingly choreographed. Since this is their first film, the director duo has a few problems with storytelling but I am glad that they made me realize how much I miss watching an action movie and actually see what's going on."

","If your into over the top martial arts, Incredible athleticism, unbelievable shootouts and jam packed action then this film is for you.<br/><br/>The story is about a man called John Wick (Keanu Reeves) who's wife has just passed away. He receives a parting gift from his wife, a small puppy named Daisy to help him deal with his mourning and grief.<br/><br/>John has a run in with a Russian gang at a gas station who become aggravated and frustrated by not being able to persuade John to sell his car. The gangsters decide to break in to his house at night and assault John, steal his car and kill his puppy in the process.<br/><br/>This sets up the vibe of the film. With John hellbent on revenge and retribution. He stops at nothing as he brutal hunts down all that were involved in burglary.<br/><br/>A few thoughts about this movie. First I wish they used real Russian actors for their parts. It would have made this film much more believable and authentic. My wife who is Russian said she couldn't understand the accents and some of the dialogue. And I myself thought they were plain and humourless.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty weak. An ex hit man hunting down all those involved in stealing his car and killing his dog. Don't expect any twists and turns or unexpected moments the film just it is what it is.<br/><br/>That being said I do hate to give this film such a low rating. John Wick and Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) was great in his role as the Mob boss and were both exhilarating to watch on screen. However the movie offers not much else in it's approach by trying make a new franchise that is both predictable and a little boring. Cinematography, visual effects, character development and story were all average at best. Amusing but a film that I will only be watching once.<br/><br/>5/10"

","John Wick is a stylish action thriller about a former hitman. Keanu Reeves excels as Wick, a top class operative who left the high paid criminal underworld to get married. When his wife dies, she leaves him a puppy to give him hope and someone to love. Unfortunately the son of a crime lord kills the dog and sets Wick on a one man mission of revenge.
The action pieces are brilliant and the criminal underworld that is introduced in this first chapter is intriguing.
Don't spend too much time thinking about this on a deep level, ultimately it's about a man who manages his grief by killing at least 50 people, but it sure is pretty to watch."
"abelka-91121","8","0","0","6 June 2020"," John Wick when Keanu Reeves snaps
","The action films are all built on a single bar. For the most part, there's a hero who spits into the soup of the bad guys. But John Wick is not like that. He was basically a bad man, meanwhile married and on the right track. But his wife dies, and he gets caught up in it. Only his wife's last gift, a puppy, pulls Wick back into reality. However, members of a Russian criminal association are upset by all this, and John Wick has to take revenge for the lost hope.
This basic concept is simply brilliant. John Wick specifically sucks on clichés. The leader of the criminal organization, Viggo Tarasov, is a true mafia leader, respectable, and no one dares to contradict him. Michael Nyqvist's play helps with that. Every single movement is dignified and absolutely convincing. In contrast, his son Josef is an unfortunate little dick.who lives in the shadow of his father, without whom he cannot even breathe. The casting is completely understandable as to why Alfie Allen was given the role. Specifically, this role Theon Greyjoy is only small. Not only is it not so much mentally ill, but it still brings a correct shaping. Willem Dafoe as Marcus the big old assassin is fantastic. Dafoe's role is very small, but still very important. Ian McShane, as the owner of the Continental Hotel, works here like a real boss who connects the criminals and no one commands him. It has its own rules and acts accordingly. Yet the loosest supporting character, Charlie, is the cleaner, who specifically summons Pulp Fiction's problem solver, Winston Wolf. He is an equally loose yet powerful figure.
And Keanu Reeves proves that he can still act as an action hero after the Matrix. The motivation of his character is completely understandable. After all, the dog has a symbolic meaning. It symbolizes attachment and humanity. The film also excels in the technical field. The film cut is tight and well scheduled. The parallel cuts are simply brilliant. The cinematography work is also very nice. Its brilliance goes well with the dark mood of the film. Both the bar scenes and the street fighting photography are very strong.
The screenplay for the film (Derek Kolstad) is very super written. It feels like the screenwriter is at home in the world of action movies. There's a mystique to Wick's character that makes it clear why he's such a good assassin. This film is reforming the world of action movies. Instead of blank visuals, we get a determined, motivated protagonist who makes the entire film himself. The main evil is a loose yet ominous figure. The action scenes are hectic and it's good to watch these scenes. A pleasant fun action dump that nails all the way in front of the screen. An unmissable creation. His sequels are sure to carry on Mr. Wick's revenge campaign and complete revenge."

","John Wick is one of those movies with a simple story line and not a whole lot of talking. How can a movie this simplistic deserve a 8.5 , Execution.<br/><br/>Keanu is always a likeable character, most likely because he is a class act in real life and it translates to screen. I also prefer that he not ramble on and like the Matrix, John Wick follows that formula.<br/><br/>John is an ex-hitman who managed to get out of the business by doing an impossible task. Why? For the love of a woman. She of course dies(of illness) in the time frame before the movie starts. His wife has a gift sent to him(after death), which she feels he will need as she is gone. It is an adorable pup.<br/><br/>Now, the son of a mob boss confronts John(not knowing he is who he is) and asks about buying his car. John says no . Junior boss and friends go to Johns house, give him a beating, kill the dog and take his car. Voila! Instant revenge movie. They build up John with the Boogeyman story. This is when you feel it in your gut. Strap in, all hell is going to break lose. And it does. Non stop action for the rest of the movie. Excellent choreographed fighting and gun play. Bits and pieces of the hitman underworld are revealed and never slow this movie down but add to the mystique.<br/><br/>So why is this movie a 8.5? I enjoy revenge movies. It raised the bar for gun fight/ fighting movies. Acting is well done and believable. It is not a one and done movie. I have seen it a half dozen times and if it is playing , I will most likely sit down and watch it again."

Sounds stupid? But the directing and movement of the characters during the incredibly long scenes of destruction are quite amazing. It's sort of a Kill Bill thing. Anyway, it is engaging. I did like that cast. The kid that was in Game of Thrones (who was eviscerated in that show) was a nice foil for Wick. We also have the fellow who is Mayhem in the insurance commercials. Of course, there are enough loose ends for the sequels (which number two at this point). I probably won't bother if they just have more of the same.

","John Wick 1 is the first of three movies. It was released in 2014. The script was written by Derek Kolstad and the film was directed by Chad Stahelski and David Leitch. The main character, John Wick, was played by Keanu Reeves. The main antagonist, Viggo Torasov, was played by Mikael Nyquist.<br/><br/>The film is about an retired assassin (John Wick) whose dog was killed by the son of a Russian gang boss. Some time before John had worked for the russian gang as an assassin: He was the best. Because the dog was the last souvenir John had from his wife (who passed away early on in the movie) he goes on a mission to find and kill the dog murderer; But as you would expect, the mafia boss doesnt want that. Viggo goes on to send all his troops to assassinate John, yet he is very scared about his son Iosef. Iosef refuses the help as he is convinced that he doesnt have a problem... I am not sure if it is his arrogance or the fact that he doesn't know John Wick for who he really is.<br/><br/>The film is packed with action filled fight scenes, so it is a good movie. I like the film because it is never getting boring and the scenery is well chosen. It is also an important film, as it is the prequel to two other movies with similar success."

The critic Katie Walsh called Avengers: Endgame the ""first-ever critic-proof movie"" and you can probably say the same for any of these (John Wick 1,2,3... 4,5?) Just cut and paste the following: ""the apex of dumb fun and frivolous action movie violence tied together by the utterly brilliant commitment of Keanu Reeves and a rotating collection of talented actors."" I still haven't seen Chapter 3 but if I had to guess, my guess would be I am going to like it exactly the same as I did Chapters 1 & 2 (a solid 7 out of 10). And guess what?

","Just want to start by saying, as far as the John Wick Franchise is concerned, it's been so great to see Keanu Reeves once again finding a sizable niche in the film industry that he can truly call his own. Not since the matrix trilogy has he really been a notable character truly worth getting behind.<br/><br/>John Wick is set in a modern day new jersey/new york setting with Keanu playing the role of a retired veteran from a dangerous and unforgiving underworld of assassins, who managed to get out of the so called industry and managed to find love on the outside. So onto the plot that reverberates for what is currently three films... (and soon to be four).<br/><br/>After his wife tragically passes away from a terminal illness, John Wick receives one final parting gift from her, a beagle puppy dog named Daisy. The following night after his wife's funeral, a group of Russian thugs break into Johns home in the early hours of the morning and viciously assault him in an attempt to steal his beloved 60's era Mustang (killing his poor innocent dog in the process). The thugs make away with the car after the attack but they don't realize they have badly angered what is seemingly the most vengeful hitman on the planet. One of the mobsters happens to be the son of a former associate of Johns who ends up at war with. It becomes 100% personal and John sets out on a merciless revenge attack against the scumbags who took away his last elements of peace.<br/><br/>This attack on John Wick's dignity sets the stage for one of the most action packed franchises in modern history and gives birth to the ""Gunjitsu"" action genre. The development of the story not just rests with John himself but with the entire assassin industry. we get introduced to a hotel known as the continental which is a safe house for the assassin industry. members can seemingly go there and find respite and solitude and that's John's way of easing himself back into the dark underworld he left behind.<br/><br/>There's not much else I wish to say in fear of spoiling too much i've probably spoilt too much already and i really hope i haven't but for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, Alfie Allen and Willem Dafoe are a couple of notable actors you can look forward to alongside Keanu who is absolutely amazing in this role. the hard work and preperation he did for these movies was parallel to none.<br/><br/>John Wick is a classic revenge tail of good vs. evil. and the two sequels are amazing in their own right. If you're a fan of fast paced action scenes and a plotline that you don't need to put too much thought into, check these movies out. they're terrific!"

","The first instalment of The John Wick trilogie has a pure but refined plot, one that many have tried to reproduce but none have Yet to even come close to the visual master piece that is John Wick.

Even though i am not the most educated on the topic i found that every scene was beautifully executed within its composition.

The direction was on point. I definitely have to praise the guy in bringing about emotions in such an intense action packed film and also in that restricted duration.
The cast, well only one guy needs to be appreciated and you know who that is.

","I'm all for a revenge bad-ass movie. I like my ""hero"" flicks where one guy takes on the world. I also like Keanu Reeves. Most people find it easy to bash his acting, and that's fine, but I like the guy because I like who he is off-screen. He's easy for me to root for on-screen.<br/><br/>I was a huge fan of how the movie started. Wick confronts the mobsters at the gas station, and there's tension, but he handles it like a pro. And then of course we are shown the other side of John Wick as he transforms into the hit-man hellbent on revenge. All of this was exciting and had me dialed in.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm putting too much focus on one scene, but I can't seem to shake it. Here is a guy described as a hitman so deadly he takes out three men with a pencil. Here is a guy who wipes out 12 men in Matrix-like fashion when they invade his home. Here is a guy who kills approximately 30-50 people during the movie on his quest to kill one man, the son of a mobster. He is relentless, cold-blooded and unwavering on this mission. A true assassin. Nothing will stop him from completing his goal of murdering the man who killed his dog and, in effect, killed his last remaining tie to his beloved, deceased wife.<br/><br/>So what does John Wick do after mowing down said bodies, finally confronting his ultimate target? He points the gun at him and doesn't shoot. That's what he does. What???<br/><br/>For about 1.5 hours I'm taught and shown this is the world's most ruthless hit-man, and he doesn't shoot the one guy he wants dead. Okay.<br/><br/>He hesitates (absolutely nothing about his character even hints at hesitation to this point in the movie), kills a guy he's pinned to the floor, and then of course raises his gun to kill the son, and now it's a chase scene. From point blank kill to let's continue this movie for another 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that is my overall take from the film. You can build a character well and then completely defy what the character is all about, just to finish out the movie for whatever reason in a different, more prolonged manner."

","The only word that keeps coming back to mind when reviewing this movie is: exhilarating. The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!<br/><br/>First and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, ""John Wick"" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn't, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn't shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you're rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn't enough, ""John Wick"" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Despite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn't original, stylish or innovative enough to say: ""we've seen this plot before, but not quite done this way"". Yes it has its brilliance, but it is kind of cheesy, even if in a good way, and predictable. It doesn't rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straight-forwardness. It does have some stakes, but all in all there isn't really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkable.<br/><br/>Obviously, that is not what it's aiming for and because of that I could recommend this movie to anybody, just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater!"

","The action shots for John Wick are some of the best in cinema. With a groundbreaking feeling on parallel to the release of another Keanu focused movie, The Matrix, action and fight sequences feel natural and steady. None of that shaky cam fake action.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't add any unnecessary padding that doesn't feel necessary to the story. However, this sometimes plays to it's detriment when we see characters come and go that try to show complexity without the time to properly develop them and make us care.<br/><br/>My biggest criticism would be in the antagonist's character, which seems to flip about halfway through the movie for no apparent reason, and feels wildly inconsistent in his behaviour and decision making.<br/><br/>This movie reeked of comic book adaptation, and it's no surprise that a comic book series has been put into motion after the films release. It plays off the comic book balance of just enough origin story to grasp the protagonist's motives, but not too much as to ruin the mystery or close off possible story archs in future titles."
"mitchell5954","9","0","0","22 May 2019"," New Action Classic!
","John Wick is easily the best action film since Skyfall. I might even like this more than Skyfall actually. This is better than any of the Expendables films, even Expendables 2. John Wick is a badass revenge flick that knows what it is and goes all-out with it. This film doesn't try to be something it isn't or be overly complicated to try to appease a certain audience. This film is really what the film Machete should've been. Machete was advertised as an awesome revenge film that brought back classic action films, but it really wasn't. It tried to be deep and relevant with constant preaching about the border and it really detracted from what the film initially was supposed to be and it was very boring and quite disappointing. This film knows what it is and it is really refreshing. Keanu Reeves brings his A-game, as does all the side cast. The action is great and well-choreographed. The villain is badass and humorous at the same time.<br/><br/>The character, John Wick, is definitely a badass you don't want to screw with. He doesn't talk much and he doesn't need to. He lets his actions speak for him and he's merciless. He doesn't screw around at all. He reminds be a lot of Liam Neeson in Taken. This film has a very similar feel to Taken. For example, I like how it's basically John Wick verses everybody for the most part. Dafoe helps him out a bit but it's mainly John by himself wasting an army of mobsters just like it was Liam Neeson by himself wiping-out a ton of bad guys with no mercy or hesitation. There is no pointless love-interest, goofy sidekick, or stupid comic relief characters put it. It's just John Wick by himself which is how it should be. However I like this film more than Taken for a couple reasons that I'll get to.<br/><br/>What's particularly cool about Wick is just the amount of build-up and praise he gets by everyone in the film including the main villain. What I like is that all the characters in this film seem to know each other particularly John himself. Everyone in this film respects John Wick and/or fears him which makes all the more badass. This shows that Keanu Reeves is great if given the right role. Many people trash him but I never found him a bad actor.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this film awesome is its side characters. William Dafoe has a smaller role as John's old friend and fellow Hitman. Dafoe is always awesome in any role he's in. You can put him in a lame Goblin costume straight from the set of Power Rangers and he'll come out awesome. The rest of the cast is equally memorable. The side characters don't get much time but they make the most of what little they have to do and all of them have presence.<br/><br/>The villain, Viggo, is okay. I like that him and Wick know each other, have worked together before, and that Viggo has a respect for John and is even quite scared of him. The way he describes John in the beginning and his constant uneasiness when he finds out he's back I find quite funny and awesome at the same time. He could've just been a nothing villain that was basically just a punching bag for Wick, but he has some pretty badass moments and has a presence to him. This is the reason I like this film more than Taken. In Taken the side characters weren't very strong and neither were the villains but that is not the case here.<br/><br/>The action is great as I said earlier. The fights are well-choreographed and there is hardly any shaky-cam. It's R-rated so they go all-out and it gets bloody. The film looks great and has an atmosphere to it. The length is just right for the film this is. If it was any longer it would've felt padded-out as some action film of late have.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick is a new modern action classic. It is definitely worth checking-out if you're into action films."

I liked the stylish color grading, and the stylish fantasy of the assassin's secret society, where assassins are smartly dressed, pay for services with standardized gold coins, and are shown respect by so many people. The music was also quite appropriate for the feel of each scene.<br/><br/>What I didn't like:
The plot was simpler than I hoped. Some plot hooks were set up in the middle of the movie, but many of them were resolved in an anticlimactic, straightforward way. Also, the fight scenes were too often unintelligible - just rapid-fire movements and gunshots meant to show how badass John Wick is, rather than making me understand the situation and wonder how John will get out of it. Finally, I didn't understand John Wick's motivation for his final fight, or the reference to a ""code"" that was mentioned around that time, or why a certain female character agreed to something near the end."

","John Wick is a movie that has all of the action trademarks that actions fans desire, and then some. There isn't anything that we haven't seen before, and it's another film that has borrowed heavily from the Bourne franchise; action sequences shown in quick-cuts and fast movements to give the audience the feel of a tense, frenetic pace.<br/><br/>However, movies like this that truly work have a decent story and their characters are intelligent as well as efficient. Jason Bourne, for instance, is methodical, and he's always five steps ahead of everyone else. Leon, from The Professional, isn't a smart man generally, but he's cold, merciless, and efficient when he kills, as any true killer would be. Robert McCall also demonstrates tremendous intelligence.<br/><br/>There are too many inconsistencies in this film. John Wick is supposed to be, according to his friends and enemies alike, the coldest, most efficient killing machine around. And yet, there are too many instances where we quickly begin to doubt the veracity of that claim. Oh, he can kill. No doubt, but he's not very good at predicting and anticipating what's coming. He lacks the intelligence of the above-mentioned characters. The characterization is inconsistent and filled with too many contradictions.<br/><br/>Someone like John Wick would never let a female assassin, who was trying to kill him, live. He would have put her down. He also would never have been lying on his bed, making himself a target.<br/><br/>Here, also, is a man who can hit moving targets as easy as pie, even effectively shooting them while driving a car. And yet, he's unable to shoot a running target in a nightclub...getting off about five or six shots...all of them missing.<br/><br/>Wick also has a ""guardian angel"" who saves him from certain death a couple of times, which also lends itself to proving that Wick isn't as bright as he would be.<br/><br/>If you're going to be a good writer, you have to stick to the plot points and abilities of your character. Contrived plot points show a weakness in your story-telling. You have to use your brain to come up with a plausible reason why Wick's target was able to elude him. This one fails miserably.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves still can't act his way out of a paper bag. He can only deliver lines one way, and it just doesn't work most of the time with this character. He's most effective when he isn't saying anything. When he does talk, his lines are said in a way to make them almost laughable.<br/><br/>Still, the movie isn't a complete failure. The supporting cast does enough to help keep the film from drowning in its own inconsistencies.<br/><br/>As a number of reviewers have stated, if you just want mindless action, John Wick works pretty well. If you want action with substance, and characters who are more believable, then you're better off watching movies with the above-mentioned characters.<br/><br/>Given that most viewers today don't care for anything with a good story or characterizations, I can see why this film was such a hit."

","Looking through other reviews it's apparent that people either love or hate this movie.
I can see both sides and personally thought the movie was rather poor, but it did have some things to appreciate about it.
Let's break it down:
(On a scale of one-ten stars)<br/><br/>Story/script/plot: one star. Really the story was just a conduit to carry all the action sequences. If you came to watch a film that has any plot or something to stimulate the mind or emotions...look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Casting/ acting: Four stars. Nothing absolutely awful but no remarkable performances. Just overall a flat, lifeless story and script that left little room for acting to have any impact or power. Actors, again, function as huminod forms for the action sequences to operate in.<br/><br/>Cinematography/ set/ lighting: Ten stars.
Here's were the film really avoids being a total flop in my opinion. The cinematography was excellent in every way. Much creative use of color motifs and dramatic lighting.
Very interesting use of specific color hues in key scenes that coincide with the tone of the story. Fantastic luxurious sets. Great chic wardrobe selections- almost like The Matrix meets Wall Street. The climactic fight sequence in the rain was a visual masterpiece.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: One star. Here's one part of the movie that really cheapend any artistic value it had going for it. The music was just so hokey. It felt like it was obnoxiously loud and overbearing intentionally in attempt to leverage the excitement the movie was lacking.
Just banal and tasteless.<br/><br/>Action/ coreography: Six stars. Okay. So this movie calls it's action ""gun Fu."" The coreography and action was just ok. Yes, it used longer sequences without changing shots and had some very intricate coreography.
But there was never any suspense built up or context to support all the action- which makes it feel less intense.
It all came off as an extended dance routine with lots of headshots.
The fancy gunwork and martial arts would carry greater weight if undergirded by some moticum of a story line or performed by a character that you actually cared about.
Without the subcontext the movie ends up subjecting the audience to watching an extended sparring match. Hollow visuals.<br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/><br/>Imagine the final fight sequence from the first Matrix where Trinity and Neo shoot up the security gate in the lobby while rescuing Morpheus...now take that scene and try to make that one scene stretch for a feature length movie.
What you get is John Wick.<br/><br/>It did have the sense of a comic book in film format: the framing choices, the lighting selections and the (goofy) colored/stylized subtitles all we're direct stylistic transplant from comic book style.<br/><br/>I'm sure 15 year old boys would love this movie. It almost feels like it was made by some 15 year old boys with their daddy's budget.<br/><br/>In short, John Wick is a beatifully filmed extended fight coreography performed by humanoid forms with some obnoxious music pumping too loudly.
John Wick is all about the visual aesthetics. To that extent, it excells.<br/><br/>You may love it. You may hate it.<br/><br/>I don't regret watching it but wouldn't recommend it as a great film to watch."

","Keanu Reeves will always be known for The Matrix, and this movie reunites him with his stunt double from those films who takes a shot in the director's chair. The film basically has 2 directors (and one is scheduled to direct Deadpool 2 so there's that), and since both come from a background of doing stunts from dozens of your favorite action movies, this film gets boiled down to its essence. They aren't going to try wowing you with a special plot; no, they're going to deliver high-octane action. And really it's quite successful.<br/><br/> Keanu did some major training for the highly choreographed scenes and performs most of his own stunts, and the result pays off. Expect a high body count, and expect many of them to have some really cool kill shots. This film knows its goal is to entertain with cool, quick action, and that's exactly what it does.<br/><br/> I will say, however, one of the best and worst parts comes from the beginning. The film honestly almost takes an Up approach of giving the audience all the exposition it needs in a small time without much dialogue at all. And I love that. But it-along with just a few action moments-gets heavy-handed. Like at one point Keanu is grabbing all his guns and gearing up, and the movie blares a rocking song about guns and killing and it feels a bit too obvious.<br/><br/> I wasn't going to talk about the plot because, well, who cares for this film, but it leads to my other critique. The film gets a nice supporting role from Willem Dafoe and gives way too little screen time to John Leguizamo, but the plot gets going after a mob boss's son steals from John Wick and leaves him for dead. This son, Iosef, is annoyingly stereotypical. He's brash, arrogant, and above all else, completely inept. He fits the bill of all the stereotypes, and it just makes you wonder how long it will take John Keanu Reeves Wick to hunt him down.<br/><br/><br/><br/> It's been awhile since an action film has had this much style to it. It overcomes typical shortcomings by thoroughly delivering in well-executed action scenes.

"paulclaassen","4","0","0","10 June 2018"," John Wick: Hero or mass murderer?
","Critics and audiences around the world raved about 'John Wick'. What did I think? Uhm, still deciding. The film starts off with so many Hollywood cliches: the flashbacks to tell the back story, the rainy weather funeral with black umbrellas... Yes, Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast as John Wick. Yes, the action scenes are non-stop and brutal. Yes, the stunts were awesome. Yet, I still didn't enjoy the film. The film has a bodycount of note, you'd think it's a John Woo film! This is just way too violent for my liking with way too much unnecessary killings. Sure, Wick was out for revenge, but this is a very extreme vengeance film. I realize he did not go on a killing spree because they took his car and dog from him. The reason for his revenge goes much deeper than that, I get it, but still...Does this justify Wick killing over a hundred people? Although it is never mentioned in the film, it is obvious Wick is an ex-hitman and therefore probably does not have a conscience, but I can't help but feel this character goes completely beyond revenge. On the contrary, it becomes cold-blooded murder instead. Also, I understand Wick was one of the best hitman, but is it possible that he can outwit and dodge so many hitmen in the club? If this is the case, this organisation seriously need new hitmen!<br/><br/>The film also features the ""no gun"" ending fight scene. Seriously, Hollywood, this is SO cliched and annoying! If Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), the crime boss, wanted John dead, why didn't he just shoot him? Why would a man in his sixties opt for a fist fight with someone as highly trained as John Wick, instead of just shooting him? This scene was not credible at all. Is it a film I'd watch again? Nope. (I must mention I absolutely loved the soundtrack.)"

","Had this been a vehicle for a more established actor, an older actor as had been initially intended, I imagine it would have been assigned to someone like Willis or Stallone and become yet another forgettable effort lost in the twilight of their careers. Its not that there's anything wrong with either Bruce or Sly, its just that they've made an unfortunate number of mediocre films in recent years in an effort to keep themselves relevant. Willis' recent ""Death Wish"" folly is an example of a film that shouldn't have been made, and yet he seems all too eager to make this rip-off of an altogether superior Bronson film. Indeed Hollywood in general has developed an industry of unintelligent, one dimensional action films, most of which are lack lustre remakes, and - through the miracle of marketing - have made them disproportionately successful. The golden era which produced Dirty Harry, Rambo: First Blood andTerminator(s) 1 and 2 appeared a distant memory in the wake of the Cranks, average Expendables sequels and the never ending stream of The Fast and the Furious films. All hope seemed lost for a decent action film which had both entertaining action sequences and some measure of intelligence applied in its creation.<br/><br/>Enter John Wick.<br/><br/>The film weighs an apparently simplistic revenge plot against a counter balance of ironic black humour, stylish cinematography, exceptional fight choreography and a star who approaches the eopnymous charcater as though he were performing in a serious dramatic role. Keanu Reeves' class adds credibilty an sympathy to a character that wuld have appeared predictable and dull had some action has-been been cast. He invokes the quiet, underplayed menace of Bronson in his best roles while also injecting a wry sense of locaonic wit.<br/><br/>Overall, I diodn't expect to enjoy this move as much as I did. Previously, I've found Reeves' earlier catalogue to be a litle trying, but since the Matrix he appears to have evolved into an altogether different class of actor. He brings the method intensity of a younger De Niro to roles which other actors would consider throwaway action stereotypes, and would only play them as such. Reeve's Wick is both terrifying in his capability for violent retribution and also tragic in his isolation and grief, something which surely cannot be said for Bruce Willis' Paul Kersey rip off. <br/><br/>So if anyone is on the fence, sit down and hit play on Netflix (UK, I can't vouch for other regions). I was expecting, as I've said numerous times, a dull and over-hyped revenge flick. What I watched might just be a modern masterpiece in this genre, both in its narrative simplicity and artistic approach, and I find it hard to fault.<br/><br/>Watch it!"
"mariahopkins-18946","9","0","0","22 May 2018"," Great action film.
","John Wick is a great action film, the kind of which are rarely made today. It is R rated but not frenzied like most action films- you know who is killing who and more importantly why. This no- holds barred action film is an example in execution. Keanu Reeves is at home in an action film and once again proves that he can do stunts as good as any actor out there even though he is well in his 50s. There's not much to write about John Wick because there isn't much of a narrative, but boy is it totally worth it. Just go watch John Wick."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","9","0","0","21 May 2018"," A modern masterpiece; action cinema at its finest.
","Not only does 'John Wick (2014)' feature fantastic action that's tightly choreographed and cleanly shot, it also has a tight story that doesn't rely too heavily on exposition and manages to create a unique world that feels tangible. A lot of people talk about it as if the action excuses the story, as if it is a 'guilty pleasure' or only good because of its above-average - phenomenal, I'd say - fight sequences, but that's actually not the case here. This isn't simply about a man who kills some people because they kill his dog. No, it is much deeper than that, with a tangible connection to the characters and solid reasoning behind everything they do, and just because the story is simple doesn't make it any less compelling or well-crafted. The film is truly fun, somewhat self-aware but also serious enough to be properly impactful, and wholly engaging. You'll be smiling throughout, at both the breathless action and the effortless craftsmanship of narrative. Keanu Reaves and Michael Nyqvist are both fantastic in the piece, two sides of the same coin, and the way that the latter is used to build this ominous legend around the former is almost genius. The flick also offers glimpses into an interesting and fully formed world but never lets that detract from its beating heart, either. I truly believe this is a near masterpiece, a marvel of modern cinema that distils its story to its most basic of elements and is all the more effective because of it. One of my favourite action films of all time. 9/10"
"MovieManChuck","Null","0","0","12 May 2018"," A sleak, fun ride at the expense of a detailed plot
","2.5/4<br/><br/>This is a very Good Friday night flick. You're home from work, and it's time to watch a movie. You don't want it to make you think, you just want good acting, lighting, direction, and cinematics, and no expenses on the plot. For that kind of night, this is a spectacular choice.<br/><br/>First off, it's not at all that the plot is half-baked. There was no waste of paper writing this script. In John Wick, the plot comes in a half-portion. It is very simple and straightforward in an intriguing way. An oppressed ex-assassin is coping with the shame of his past-actions and the recent death of his wife. The last thing his wife gives him is a puppy. When the foolish son of his old crime-boss breaks into his house, kills the puppy, and takes off in Wick's Mustang...""Well I think I'm back!!""<br/><br/>On another note, the actors really fit into their roles. Keanu Reeves, who is a veteran in stylized action sub-genre, really rocks Wick in much the same fashion he did Neo in The Matrix (1999). This time though, he takes on a much more cold, The-Man-In-Black type persona... a man of few words. The action sequences are quick, flashy, and all produce the same end result. It can get a tad monotonous after a while, but in the end it conveys John Wick as a character more. It shows that a broken man who has everything taken from him will have the most incentive to get to what he wants. Alfie Allen, although his character is never able to be presented in a likable, preforms his immature young adult criminal. Another very sublime detail that you might not pick up on is that the mob is very talky, profane, and excersises little patience, yet Wick is a thinker. John Wick is a character you can truly root for in his conquest to avenge his anguish.<br/><br/>Cinematography proves another segway to the movie's stunning fluidity. Toward the beginning, Sela exaggerates very dark shades of black, and airy shades of white, giving the movie a very docile and harmless feel. As the plot unravels, you see the development of heavy greys kick in, and as the action sequences commence, neon and black become the dominant themes. It makes for a very tidy feature with slick fight sequences.<br/><br/>Another item not usually found in this particular genre... a good balance of everything, from an editing standpoint right down to the acting. I was pleasantly suprised that John Wick had the delivery that it's predecessors seldom did."

The story is simple but effective, and you understand John Wick's motivations. The action and stunts are amazing! They're some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen on screen, and the best part is that you can SEE the action. No quick cuts or shaky cam nonsense, the action is clear and brutal. Best action scene in the whole movie is the night club scene. This is an action movie lover's wet dream. Only nitpick I have with this is that the end fight scene is a little standard and clichéd, but its a small gripe, the movie is still amazing. Its a must see and is one of the best action movies of the 2010's."

","An action film staring Keanu Reeves playing a character named John. Better than what everyone thought it would be<br/><br/>The action is incredible and it's very obvious how much training Keanu was doing in order to show the amount of skill that this character shows and is implied to have. Even the supporting actors have went through some level of training in order to portray their characters skill level in their profession.<br/><br/>One criticism I'd have is that Ms. Perkin seems a little dumb, having the balls to break the established Hotel rule of 'no business being conducted in the hotel' and it is shown that they hold up on that punishment, so even if she did manage to finish off John Wick, how was she thinking of getting away with that? Another thing is that he personally hires Marcus to assassinate John, a character who is shown right in the beginning to have a friendly conversation with John, implying they know each other and are probably friends. Did he really expect him not to go against Viggo's orders and even help the man? He was best not to even tell Marcus, perhaps even try to keep him in the dark about the whole thing.<br/><br/>Despite that, John Wick is still quite a lot of fun to watch and if you like realistic choreographed action, then you're gonna love this movie and it's sequel."

"MovieSoup","7","0","0","2 September 2017"," Don't mess with his dog Theon!!!!!!
","John Wick is a very decent action movie starring Keano Reeves as John Wick who is a highly skilled assassin. He receives a dog in the mail (which is a bit strange, I mean the dog just gets delivered to him by mail) from his dead wife straight after her funeral. Some Russian/American guy called Iosef Tarasov (played by Theon Greyjoy out of Game of Thrones) decided he likes wick's car and steals it then kills the dog..Then the sh*t hits the fan. <br/><br/>To start off this movie has a very simple plot with no interesting twists or turns in it at all. The main focus of this movie is to show John Wick killing lots of people with no real mercy shown. This is purely a revenge movie in the simplest form. While the plot is simple this does not make it a bad movie at all. <br/><br/>Reeves plays an action hero really well when the character does not have a huge amount of depth to him. The other characters as well are pretty basic and can be boiled down to simple motives for each of them. Wick wants vengeance for his dog which was special to him because it was given to him by his dead wife, Iosef Tarasov is wants to be a gangster because his farther is a gangster and so takes what he wants because he thinks that's what gangsters do to get respect. Iosef's farther (viggo) wants to stay alive and make lots of money like mob bosses always want to do and his son keeps fu**ing it up. <br/><br/>I loved the bit where Viggo just found out his son stole John Wick's car and killed his dog. Just that moment of ""you don't understand who you messed with"" was very entertaining. I also really enjoyed all of the scenes with the hotel receptionist in as he was so matter of fact when Wick would turn up to the hotel (which is sort of like a safe house for hit men and criminals in the film) all bloody and wounded from killing gangsters. He did not bat an eye and would just asked if he needed assistance.<br/><br/>Okay so the action scenes were very well done. Whoever choreographed the fight scene in the club and Wick's house knew what he was doing for sure. While there were lots of talking that did not really progress the plot the action scenes made up for this easily. <br/><br/>The camera work was good as I did not see any of that wobbly camera thing you see in all bad action movies. Nothing worse than an action scene where you can't see the action because of excessive camera movement. The drone shots of the New York skyline were interesting to see at night as well.<br/><br/>The film is well edited and the pacing is very fast as you would expect from an action film. Does not get bogged down with over-explaining plot point that don't need explaining. The soundtrack was okay in the same way elevator music is okay. It does not bother anyone and you do not notice it too much. Just generic action movie score. Nothing to get excited over. <br/><br/>This film is worth checking out for the action scenes which are competent and simple plot points make it an easy watch. The reason for the rating was that this film is just that.simple. Now there is nothing wrong with simple but I like my movies to have a little bit more substance and complexity. Look at Die Hard and you will see what I mean. This film had no Hans Grubber at all. But it was entertaining and that is really the least we can all ask from movies."

No hesitation, just one after another killed by his skill for doing this. It was quite brutal, I'll be honest, but nonetheless very effective. Theon Greyjoy was unrecognizable (at first) as the snotty son who thought he could get away with killing Wick's dog. I loved the whole hotel/safehouse aspect of the story, that was pretty cool. I haven't seen the sequel yet but I've been told it's better than the first one so I'm looking forward to seeing it soon.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie to action lovers for sure and maybe those who are looking for a good action movie because there hasn't been a good one in quite a while it seems."

The dialect and accent is so obviously from a Scandinavian country and not near how Russians speak having learned the English language later in life. I cannot comment on the actual Russian dialect itself, but the English is way off. It's too bad really, he should've gotten help with a language coach to hit off that accent.

Over-the-top yet a guilty pleasure revenge action flick with Reeves (in arguably his finest role since THE MATRIX) as the titular lethal assassin in retirement who finds himself shoved back into his old ways when the punk son of a former associate Russian mobster (Nyqvist in oily mode) who steals his prized '69 Mustang and kills his puppy - a gift from his recently deceased, beloved wife (Moynahan). Hell bent on getting revenge Wick is laser focused on his prime initiative with a wake of destruction and a huge body count while being contracted for his own hit in the process. Newbie director Chad Stahelski (a veteran stuntman who collaborated with Reeves on THE MATRIX films among others) shows his chops in the carefully executed non-stop fight/shoot sequences with aplomb and enabled with a rogues gallery of veteran character actors peppered out makes up for the somewhat graphic novel trappings of the film border lining pulp cartoon ridiculousness from the anything goes script by novice Derek Kolstad but keeps things brutally lively."
"tonyflintjackson","4","5","16","19 January 2015"," Don't believe the hype!
","OK, many are attempting to show this as the return of Keanu Reeves, I'm sorry to say this is not true. Keanu Reeves never went anywhere and if you want to see a recent film with him that you would enjoy a lot more watch ""Man of Tai Chi"". <br/><br/>This film is weak, story wise as well as direction. It seems the director has watched many Michael Mann movies, but still failed on many levels. It seems there were Russian's involved in the film, but were incapable of finding proper Russian actors!?! This film is a average 4/5 stars out of 10, I'm just annoyed that it was all hype/fluff but no substance, this is pissing me off. Looking at the IMDb reviews it seems there is a campaign to make this film look better then it actually is.<br/><br/>The storyline is full of holes. John Wick is the man they call when you want to get rid of the bogeyman, I mean that is how much of a bad ass he is. Assassins/Mafia Dons..etc are supposedly afraid due to his amazing killing skills, so when 3 incompetent masked ""russian"" gangsters break into his house, kill his puppy and beat the crap out of him... wait for it... to nick(steal) his car, you wonder what sort of super hit-man is this who doesn't even have a decent alarm system or the capabilities to defend himself? Later on in the same house 10+ well armed (supposedly less incompetent) gangsters break into his house again and he kills them all without too much hassle.. so what gives? You are either a bad-ass or a pussy... not sure what the story writers were thinking off. There are other scenes(bath house), where he could have easily killed off the guy who nicked his car and the film would have finished within the first hour... but for some reason misses this guy, but everyone else in the bathhouse is dead.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you have to watch this, do it with very low expectations, you might enjoy it then. This is one of Keanus weaker movies, I would rate the ""Bill & Teds"" adventures above this one."

","Punisher meets The Expendables.<br/><br/>If you were engaged by the dialog in The Expendables, and liked its character development, then this might be the right movie for you. It's a classic revenge movie, like Punisher or any Steven Seagal movie of your choice.<br/><br/>It is a classic revenge movie with non-stop action where most of the effort went into the action scenes. Not surprisingly, both directors have been stunt coordinators since the beginning of the 90's and this is their first time directing a movie.<br/><br/>Check out this movie if you're looking to switch off your mind for a couple of hours and don't mind repeating action scenes."
"siderite","7","5","16","13 January 2015"," Don't they ever learn? Do not kill the dog!
","You have to watch this film knowing that its makers wanted to pay homage to manga, old style samurai movies and directors like John Woo. Everything is... ordered, like something in a Japanese film. There is a code for everything, a way to do things that has to be followed. That is why when the action starts and there are some obvious shortcuts to everything, people don't take them. I am pretty sure somewhere there is a Japanese samurai script or manga that they adapted and the original characters did everything with swords.<br/><br/>The choreography is decent, with Keanu doing a combination of Matrix and Equilibrium moves that (finally!) are not all in slow motion. The basic plot is that his character gets angry and starts killing people and then the film ends. If you don't appreciate the style, then the film will be wasted on you.<br/><br/>That being said, I have to say that I think the film was not that good. It was not bad, but there were opportunities missed to make it truly unique and memorable. As such, one enjoys the actions scenes then forgets the movie. <br/><br/>One of these opportunities was to use the amazing cast they had. Forget that Bridget Moynahan had only a few scenes in some flashbacks and that sexy Adrianne Palicki was completely underexposed, but actors the like of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo should have been the bread and butter of the film. Instead, they were relegated to minimal supporting roles.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly for the film, but totally expected of the actor, the best action scenes where those involving Daniel Bernhardt, who moved with the same grace and precision that he had when he did all those martial arts films in his youth. He was so good that it just showed he could have kicked Keanu's behind any time he wanted to.<br/><br/>Another opportunity was a detailing of Wick's glory days. Instead we are treated with a monologue vaguely explaining how awesome and efficient Wick was when he was a contract killer. Really? He wasn't that way in the film! Keanu played his usual silent brooding self, but at least in one scene, the one where he shouts at Viggo to give him the son, he shows the potential that was lost in writing his character.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a rather average action flick, feeling more like a video game than a samurai movie. Instead of minutes and minutes of nameless minions being killed, a strong contouring of the characters, at least of the main ones, would have been a lot more effective. Like many others, I am sure, I was attracted to see the movie by the cast which was, unfortunately, underutilized."
"HazyDavey","3","6","21","15 January 2015"," Would be good movie if not...
","I gave this movie 3 stars for Keany Reeves, acting, shooting/fighting scenes and camera work. Other than that... Don't they have some Russian ex-pats in Hollywood? I know there is large Russian community in LA... Why them Hollywood managers won't hire at least one Russian to sort out all dialogs? It really looks hilarious when Russian mob boss mumbles something incomprehensible to his idiot son and than switches to perfect English in the middle of a phrase. There were a lot more examples, but I'll stop here. English is not my 1st language but I can tell you Russian dialogs in this movie are freakin' hilarious. It is sad, that otherwise good movie was screwed up by inept and ignorant Hollywood bosses. The scrips is kind of weak too, but it was said enough about it here, so I'll save your time. Overall enjoyed it watching in a gym while running on elliptic machine. Perhaps that's what this film is good for. But I wouldn't pay for this. Thanks to torrent sites."

","John Wick is one of the best action movies to come out this year, and possibly one of the best of this entire decade. Now don't go into it expecting a Best Picture nominee, but go into it expecting Keanu Reeves to kick some serious ass and you won't be disappointed. Is it predictable in parts? Yes. Is there some cheesy dialogue? Yes. Does that hurt the movie? Not at all. It's exciting, exhilarating, stylish, incredibly violent, and deserves to be seen multiple times in the theater. I cannot recommend this movie enough. <br/><br/>Also, if you don't have a dog, that might change quickly after seeing this movie."
"jackc-217-3801","9","4","12","20 January 2015"," Best Action Film since The Bourne Identity
","These people giving it less than 4 stars have no idea what makes an action film. <br/><br/>This was a near flawless action film with original sequences, a great cast, powerful scenes and a trip back to a noir theme (an underground culture of economy and honor among killers) that seemed to die out in the action films of the 80s. The closest to this, was maybe Ronin from 1998. The camera work was phenomenal and dialog above passable. When you have a movie audience sobbing and cheering, you have a good emotional grasp of the material. This film achieved art. I really appreciated the wide open plot continuation possibility, but sometimes great films are just left to stand alone."
"linda-price95","5","7","26","27 October 2014"," Same Script Different Actors
","Maybe it was just me but I felt it was the same old movie with the recycled plots about a trained assassin who used to work for ""the agency"", enjoying retirement until someone makes him mad and he comes out of retirement. This movie had no plot and the action was mindless, just killing everyone. Maybe there should have been a better reason for the revenge. I enjoyed the scenes with Daisy, however, was sad at how that ended up. I like Keanu Reeves & Willem Defoe which was the reason why I went to see it. If you enjoy violent, shoot em up, blood & guts movies, then this movie is for you. There were some scenes that took place at the hotel with Mr. Wick's interaction with a few gentlemen that made me chuckle, but all in all, I didn't enjoy it."

","The story is pretty good. Keanu is good but I found it rather boring. The action scenes aren't exciting, it's just Wick killing a butt load of people with little effort. There's an occasional over the shoulder move in there but this is basically an unexciting massacre. The body count had to be close to 100.<br/><br/>I grew up with a 69 mustang so that was fun to see. And the dogs death is handled with taste."

","When you watch a lot of action films, you get to the point where you can write the plot. If you're a really good writer, you can write interesting genre pieces. If you are a hack, tired tales come out: <br/><br/>* Bob, the ex-plumber's chance at reforming his life is challenged when a crazed IRS section chief kidnaps Bob's wife and kids.<br/><br/>* Officer Walker gets his shot at the case to end all cases when Kermit the Alien invades the small town of Wyoming, MI to impregnate all the prostitutes.<br/><br/>This is the curse of the story of John Wick. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, an ex-super hit-man, who pursues a vendetta against his former boss' son for killing Wick's dog.<br/><br/>The dog line is a running joke that falls flat each time it's spoken. People can't believe that Wick would do all the killing he does in the movie over a dog. I'm not certain if the filmmakers want us to laugh over it, too. It's not a well constructed statement like ""Snake Plisken? I thought you were dead."" Nor is it ironic enough. But they keep putting it out there.<br/><br/>That's the film in a nutshell. It's a weak story highlighted with sub-par craftsmanship.<br/><br/>For action, the film takes the AK-47 route. A lot of people get shot...in the head, which makes for great blood origami murals. (By the way, if all these people die in these types of films, how do we have massive overcrowding on the planet?) There are six mass killing scenes; one at Wick's residence, one in a dance club, one in a church, two in abandoned buildings, and the final.<br/><br/>There is not much to distinguish one from the other. Most of that has to do with the script from Derek Kolstad, but Chad Stahelski's direction wasn't any better. In the scene at the church, there is a secret stash. It's a scene that begs for suspense, tension and thrills. There are none. There is some shooting, some primping and some f-bombs. In a scene that many writers and directors would do their best to show off their talents, they do the minimum to advance the plot.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is a mystery. Before the Matrix he displayed an ease with slipping into the parts that came his way. Now he can't seem to flesh them out fully for the big screen. There was no empathy established for John Wick's character. And there is no moment where Reeves connects with the audience as he once could do with the drop of a ""Whoa!"" Maybe he has to go through the bottom barrels to re-discover his talent. I hope he gets it back soon."

Despite some scenes taking you out of the moment, John Wick was a good surprise with a fantastic pay off. It feels so original and fresh that you instantly get into all the fast actions sequences and the story (unlike most in it's genre) is quite great and easy to follow.<br/><br/>Whilst John Wick isn't quite perfect, it adds all the ingredients for it to be the best action movie ever made.

","""Now you're truly getting on my wick. JOHN Wick."" <br/><br/>The boldest and ballsiest shoot them up film discharged in years. With a straightforward reason, an implicit mythology thus numerous severe head-shot kills that you need to ponder whether John Wick's whole preparing has been spent mastering Call Of Duty, this film conveys more than only 101 minutes of extraordinary activity, it gives the makings of a welcome, crisp establishment. <br/><br/>Numerous will view it as something of an arrival to shape for Keanu Reeves and it is reasonable to consider it such, however simply because - critically - he isn't obliged to really act that far out of his customary range of familiarity. As a previous hit-man lamenting his wife's passing, Wick is a man who is sincerely cut off. And after that, when Russian hooligans break into his home to take his sweet ride, thrashing him in the process and slaughtering the puppy that his wife purchased for him from past the grave, Wick returns back to his old methods for being a stone-cool executioner. In any case, we win on the grounds that Reeves is obliged to do small emoting other than the odd cry at an opportune time. <br/><br/>Indeed, it's telling that the couple of minutes where eyebrows get raised are the point at which the film is by all accounts considering itself excessively important, and these generally happen when Wick gets truly irate and Reeves winds up wrath snarling like Bale's Batman attempting to make himself really inhale fire. <br/><br/>More to the point however, executives Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (the last setting off uncredited because of a DGA question) know how to arrange marvelous activity set-pieces, which joyfully make up around 80% of the film. With over 20 years of motion picture trick work under each of their profession belts, Stahelski and Leitch plainly know how to make the best of their projectile ridden beats, conveying smooth, quick paced scenes of all around made executioner confusion. <br/><br/>The majority of this makes for a consummately serviceable requital thriller, a Death Wish return to a type that feels decades old in any case, just to go that additional mile, John Wick is raised to date with a key component required for any film to be effective in this day and age: it feels like a comic-book adjustment. <br/><br/>As the film advances, it is set up that, not just does John Wick have a close super-powered level of capability in terms of executing individuals, however there is a whole system of hit men and hitwomen, who keep a set up code of honor, arrangement in a unique money and even have their own place of refuge â€“ an inn oversaw by the unshakable Lance Reddick who caters for his visitors' requirements with balance and self-control. It's not until you achieve past the film's midpoint that you understand this is yet another motion picture that has made its own universe to investigate, an increased reality with heaps of potential for future spin-offs. <br/><br/>All of which may make you feign exacerbation. All things considered, who needs another establishment with another 'verse to be wrung dry? It's difficult to gripe however when John Wick is such a smaller, punchy film without an ounce of fat on it. In this first motion picture of a mooted set of three, there's no space for over saturation of the idea, or for cushioning out with hybrid references and referrals. It's only a short, sharp, projectile driven bulldozer of a motion picture that snaps necks and smothers brains. What's more, if that isn't sufficient for you, go re-watch The Lake House or something"

","The scenes that are seen in the trailer pale in comparison with what this movie has to offer, action-wise.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is once again proving that he can still be a total bad ass while also showing grief, anger, sorrow and love in the same movie. <br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about an ex hit-man who gets crossed by the son of an old Russian business partner and the story of said hit-man getting back what's been taken from him...<br/><br/>We have a good performance delivery by Michael Nyqvist, who, even if being predictable at times, manages to get on everybody's nerves with his proverbs, including Keanu's character. Nonetheless, the antagonism is pretty well built, in my opinion. <br/><br/>Don't expect too much drama, the story line is very simple and blunt, yet, expect plenty of hurting and.... head-shots!"

","One never tends to expect much from a movie staring Keanu Reeves. Why? I'm not sure, I think he does just fine and I'm usually entertained, but that's just me. This movie is, well, if you abhor violence, this movie is NOT for you. I don't like violence for no reason, but the violence in this movie IS the reason for the movie. It's fast, it's justified (bear with me) and it's amazing.<br/><br/>Others have given plot summaries but it seems almost required so; Former Hit man goes for revenge on the scumbag gangsters who wronged him and as it happens, he has a connection with them. OK. That's over with.<br/><br/>Not since ""Shoot 'Em Up"" has a movie been solely about the violence and not since ""Shoot 'Em Up"" has it been done so well. Even the faint of heart could enjoy this movie and trust me, I know people who cringe at violence in movies, my wife is THE prime example, and yet, you get lost in the action. It's non-stop. The few breaks between fights and shootings are seemingly filler, but necessary filler.<br/><br/>I had heard great things, but once I watched it today, I was VERY impressed. How do you root for a bad guy? Well, when he's killing WORSE guys, how can you not root for him? And yeah, he kills a LOT of them.<br/><br/>John Wick also displays a certain charm, not a 007 type of charm, but an all business charm. He will never mess with you if you're not a part of his business. Is that ETHICS? Sure, why not. He's not flamboyant, he's not over the top, he's all business, yet very civil, very refined and decent...unless you ARE his business.<br/><br/>I was far more impressed than I expected and I DID expect to be impressed. If you don't like violence, don't see this. If you don't mind violence so long as it has a purpose and moves the story, you'll LOVE this. If you LOVE violence, seek help and soon. You're potentially dangerous."

","Slick, stupid, senseless action entertainment stars Keanu Reeves in the title role. Wick is a former assassin whose wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan, in a thankless role) dies from an unspecified disease. The lonely and distraught Wick receives a final present from her one night: a beagle puppy named Daisy. Soon, Russian creeps led by the infantile Iosef (Alfie Allen) break into his home, steal his car, and beat Daisy to death. Now Wick has nothing left to live for but revenge, and he goes after the Russian mob - his old employers - with a ferocious tenacity.<br/><br/>This viewer felt about as bad as he could for Mr. Wick, given that the characters - all of them, really - are thinly written. While it provides some visceral joy watching this force of nature unleash his fury on a non-stop parade of thoroughly expendable action movie villains, there's not that much humanity. The guy wades through henchmen so quickly that he turns into the kind of superhero too often seen in this genre. Fortunately, he does take *some* lumps before this is over, and at one point it looks as if it might be curtains for him.<br/><br/>There is a ton of violence, and a ton of digital splatter, although not very much that would be likely to seriously gross out some viewers. The pacing is definitely of a very deliberate variety, until the story - such as it is - begins to take off. While all of this is mildly amusing, ""John Wick"" doesn't really do anything that we haven't seen before in scores of action-revenge sagas.<br/><br/>Keanu is once again a figure in minimalist ""acting""; in his one attempt to truly emote, he does his best, but he's still not that convincing. Ian McShane and John Leguizamo are thoroughly wasted in cameo roles; Willem Dafoe gets a little more to do. Swedish star Michael Nyqvist offers some fun as the mob boss. Allen is such a weasel that he can't die soon enough. Adrianne Palicki, like Nyqvist, is entertaining enough as a persistent would be hit woman. Other familiar faces include Lance Reddick, Dean Winters, Daniel Bernhardt, Randall Duk Kim, Clarke Peters, Kevin Nash, and the always welcome (if much too briefly seen) David Patrick Kelly as the leader of a team that cleans up peoples' messes.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" is an agreeable enough, but also forgettable, way to kill 102 minutes.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

Even Arnold's movies had good plots (Total Recall), made sense (Terminator), or were lighthearted swashbuckling action, like True Lies. Instead this was a comedy scene after scene, I couldn't believe it, I thought may be it's supposed to be a parody of the 80's and 90's movies:<br/><br/>1. It starts out nice, but then, he drives around the airport like it's supposed to be a challenge driving fast in wide-open spaces.<br/><br/>2. He got no alarm or any safety on his house, and gets ambushed like a complete amateur by guys wearing hard soled shoes. His excuse was that he was rusty, but only a day later, he is not rusty any more, but, without any practice he kills 12 people, which brings me to: <br/><br/>3. This rusty guy has an aim-bot in his brain and hand, and kills everyone with head-shot despite incredible speeds at which action must be moving when a dozen people attack you at the same time.<br/><br/>4. Everyone in New York knows him, everyone is afraid of him, even cops, people at ""hotel"", garage owners, and Russian mafia, but only the son doesn't know him. In the end, I was expecting the mafia guy to contact corrupt army general, who sends drones to attack, but when the radar recognizes John Wick, the computer sets and locks the autopilot to fly back home.<br/><br/>5. When he attacks the son, and the Vigo, his aim goes bad due to signal jamming.<br/><br/>6. This war machine foolishly leaves curtains open so any two-bit sniper can take him out from 100 meters....<br/><br/>7. He lets the woman sneak up to him (again while sleeping) without, again, setting some kind of personal alarm <br/><br/>8. Bad guys shoot him 3 times in the club, instead of unloading 20-30 bullets in the guy that just killed half the club. He shrugs 3 shots easily. Carries no armor.<br/><br/>9. He is in wide open space, only 2 guys manage to hit him, when someone is about to shoot from behind, he ""feels"" the aim and turns and instantly shoots the bad guy.<br/><br/>10. He does all this for a dog, but before the film is over, and the bones haven't even decomposed, he find another dog like he has already forgotten about the old one....that's how much he loved him.<br/><br/>This is only what I can remember right now, I'm sure there is more. This movie, full of fantasy scenes, strange motivations, inconsistent characters, and old plots (vigo and his bad son ), strange assassin operation (I bet they tried to get Morgan Freeman to play the black guy at the reception desk), etc, doesn't deserve anything but criticism, or these idiots will continue to put out movies like this.

Vengeful returns usually end ugly with blood spilling all over the place. John Wick is no different, with revenge as the cornerstone. The director/s (and/or Lionsgate) knows you want an action (franchise?) film, so there's a crap tonne of action that seems to seamlessly end and begin with gusto. <br/><br/>Cool subtitles. Colorful, unique and enhanced the viewing experience without ruining the momentum of the fight scenes. <br/><br/>Everything is shallow. Who is John Wick besides a mourning expert super assassin with a quench for vengeance? But more importantly, why is Ryan O'Reilly (Dean Winters) from the superb TV show Oz even doing there? I still don't know. <br/><br/>Shallow? Pfft, who cares? It's better this way. You see, bad-guys and assassins like to hang together in their own bars and hotels away from the general population. When Wick goes back into the assassin world leaving the 'real' one behind, this separation of the two worlds permits us to be entirely immersed in John Wicks murderous mission. Better to avoid pesky thoughts of the potential for innocent bystanders."

And considering all that you have every right to call this movie ""just another dumb plot-less action movie starring Keanu Reeves"". But despite all that - this movie was an hour and a half of pure entertainment. The low expectation you have when you walk in the theater to see John Wick are immediately justified. You get a brainless action movie, with no special effects whatsoever, except for the gallons of blood, a lot of guns and shoot- outs , and an unrealistic fear of one single dude. Also the bad-ass soundtrack that really adds a specific feeling to this movie. John Wick was not too long or too short - it was the perfect length for what it's supposed to be. <br/><br/>If you're expecting to see the 'Best motion picture of the year', well this movie is not for you.

"RomeoKnight","4","3","8","31 March 2015"," Juvenile video game violence with lots of Ford and Apple product placement
","Where to start? I'm so baffled. The title says it all. I'm hoping that this movie is based on a comic book character because the events that took place in the movie are so ludicrous and clichéd that realism flies right out of the window about after 15 minute mark. <br/><br/>It's starts with a basic plot for this type of movie: Some rough boy has lost his wife and he's trying to live a ""normal"" life. After awhile some random bad guys appear to the scene out of thin air. For no reason, these bad guys want to steal our hero's ancient Ford (which is constantly being glorified throughout the film) and they end up taking it and killing the ""poor"" guys dog in the process. Up to this point, I really was on Keanu's side for all things considered. Then the movie really starts going crazy so you don't need your brains anymore. Of course, the guy now starts seeking revenge for them taking his beloved Ford and killing his puppy he owned about 24 hours. Soon we get to see that Keanu is some kind of ""retired"" super invincible contract killer that can take masses of bad guys out with a snap of his finger. The movies story is basically about a man who wants to revenge to those evil ""foreign"" (well of course!) bastards who killed his puppy. That's it! I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>Okay, this movie could be cool and very entertaining action flick because of loads of good/great actors like Willem Dafoe and the guy from Game of Thrones who gets the torture treatment. Cinematography is great, lots of gun fights and Kung Fu fights and whatnot. But the plot is so damn juvenile and video-gamish that I, 30-something, just couldn't take it. I'll give an example. 20 or so fully armed and trained killers arrive at Keanu's house in the middle of the night. He kills them all with little effort like in Steven Seagal movies taking only scratch to his head. You need to have superpowers to survive that situation. In another scene, Keanu enters bad guys nightclub, which is full of trained and armed guards WAITING him to arrive. That doesn't stop him waltzing trough the building and pretty much dodging all the punches and bullets aimed at him. Only one cool guy with a scar (of course) manages to put even a little fight against our hero. That was the best moment because I really was rooting for the bad guys this time. Senseless slaughtering goes on and on while body-count keeps growing. There was actually a scene where they showed a van full of wrapped up bodies our hero was able to kill at this ""first level"" of his. ""Cool"" rock music plays loud at the background while Keanu keeps slicing and dicing the bad guys like some Marvel superhero. I would be OK if this was Superman or Batman but it isn't. All this ""coolness"" is added with very visible product placements from Apple and Ford mainly which almost made me puke. <br/><br/>The plot is like straight from some video-game like Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid. I think even they have better story than this one. This basic revenge type of movie plot is just so overdone already and John Wick surely adds nothing new to the genre. Should I say the movie lacks soul. I managed to watch it one hour and that was it. I like action movies but this was just too over the top for me thank you. I could predict pretty much everything that was going to happen on screen.<br/><br/>If you like video-game style violence and Steven Seagal style high body-count action with a script that's lacking any intelligence or realism, this movie is definitely for you."

","I've never understood why people summarize movies in their reviews; bores me to tears.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved this, Keanu does a good job and he's believably deadly; thought the 'man of the match' went to Michael Nyqvist though - without his solid performance it could have been drivel.<br/><br/>Wasn't sure about the way the Russian language was subtitled, but hey, trying new things can lead to interesting innovation.<br/><br/>I don't really know what else to say - it was just REALLY COOL (aesthetically speaking); think 300 meets Heat and it doesn't give a fudge what you think of it."

","It seems a lot of people that have written a bad review of this movie were expecting a completely different dramatic movie. If you do like action flicks with great fight scenes, a believable plot and a believable story line then give this a go. Honestly, it's Bourne Identity fight scenes, with COD shooting, a little comic book feel thats mixed with some great cinematography, and a whole lot of killing. The movie is straight bad ass, no over developed characters taking time away from mayhem, no stupid happy love story, and no sub plots or other bull crap. Keanu is great in this role, Dafoe is awesome, Leguizamo is short and to the point and Dean Winters is great as well. This isn't Citizen Kane, thank god, its an action movie, plain and simple..... guns, death, ass kicking!"

"michaeloneillire","2","5","17","24 January 2015"," Save yourself a couple of hours
","I don't normally write reviews but this one took me by such a surprise I thought I'd try and save some other viewers from wasting their time.<br/><br/>Before watching this I had a look on IMDb. Normally anything above a 6 is watchable. This was 7.3 so I thought it'd be our movie for the evening. Unanimously the group of us thought it was dire.<br/><br/>Problems<br/><br/>The plot. The set up for the story is unbelievable. We spend 15 minutes looking at Wick mourning his wife at the start of the movie. It wasn't the most riveting stuff. Later in the movie we find out that everybody in New York (I think) seems to know who John Wick is. Except for the 3 idiots that stole his car. Which brings me to them. Why would they bother stealing his car. What was their motive. Yeah it's a nice car but they stole it to sell it. They didn't need the money. Apparently there's only one cop in America. We see about 100 people die in this movie in the city and the only cop we see is at Wicks house.<br/><br/>Some corny scenes. We don't see how Wick is the bogeyman. We get told it. That seemed cheap to me. Did you know he killed 3 guys in a bar, with a pencil. Great, good to know. Wick had the main car thief in his sights half way through the movie. He could have shot him there and then. Nope, we're only half way through the movie so I'll just look at him when I'm pointing my gun at him. When he runs about 10 seconds later, I'll start shooting. The hotel manager meeting the girl assassin to tell her that her admission to the hotel had been revoked permanently only to have her shot immediately. Did he really need to make the trip. The bit with Wick and his ""mate"" at the graveyard. That was some of the driest dialog I've ever seen. ""Fuel the chopper"". Good god. Has anybody ever made a phone call to say that to anybody ever. Why wouldn't the chopper be fuelled already. Are they stored empty. Why not just say we're on our way, have the chopper ready. The main bad guy has Wick tied up and ready to die. Rather than finish the job I'll leave it to my too henchmen and I'll run off to my car to drive off. Can you guess what's going to happen next. When Wicks finished his killing spree and going to head off into the sunset I'll kill his only mate and ring him up to tell him.<br/><br/>What annoyed me most I think is that with a bit more effort the film could have been good. How about at the start of the movie have his wife killed by an attempted carjacking, rather than having 15 minutes of him moping around after she died of cancer. I could get behind his killing spree then rather than him going off after his dog (which he had for 2 days) was killed.<br/><br/>On the plus side Keanu was on top form, in the action scenes. In the dialog scenes he wasn't so good but I think that's more to do with the dialog being so bad."
"menvaffan","Null","5","17","13 January 2015"," Zero stars.
","Willem Dafoe is bad at aiming: So my guess is that this is some old stunt-friend of Keanu's who now directs his first full length feature and Keanu has simply agreed to help out. Because the directing is silly, the script is bad, the dialogue is laughable at best, the plot is weak, Keanu is as ""whoa"" as always, the other actors are ludicrous, the characters are not believable, the hardrock guitars in every fight is cliché, and for me as a swede it is fun to see Mikael Nyquist in a film, but my guess is that he only got cast because his English pronunciation is so cheesy. If you want to see an awesome movie without a plot, solely based on constant fighting and violence that feels, go watch The Raid instead. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen, and the first time I give anything zero stars. Not even a soundtrack featuring Marilyn Mansons weakest song to date saves this."
"jkm0119","2","7","27","8 November 2014"," Music ruins the movie
","The movie was good but I must say that the musical score was terrible. It actually ruined the movie. Whoever wrote that score should be fired and the producer that allowed it should never produce. If one could put a good musical score to this movie it would be great. The music overpowers the story and the action. I am graceful for giving it a 4. If it was not for the music it would have been a nine. It amazes me how a bad musical score can make a movie bad to watch. The Acting gets a 9.5 the movie gets a 4. The Music in the movie ruins the movie. The story is just OK but is not much of a story. There is no plot except revenge. The action is good but is overpowered by the horrible music. They should learn from 007 that the music should actually fit what the action says. If you want ghetto music with 007 action watch this. If you want action and can not stand the ghetto music turn the sound off because the dialogue says nothing."
"Yarrg","3","45","262","15 October 2014"," Uninspiring...
","I honestly like so many others wanted to see Keanu's frown turn upside down. But like in 47 Ronin, Keanu disappoints in a story rehashed a million times over and seeks only to tarnish further a reputation soaked in the odour of box-office poison.<br/><br/>This is basically a revenge flick for the common movie-goer. the common movie-goer nowadays being a 12 y.o, snapback wearing, Nike sporting thug amazed by the explosions upon screen rather than immersing storytelling. Being a fan of the revenge genre, I long to see a movie that can strike conflicting emotions in me, alas this is not one of them.<br/><br/>Keanu again plays the blank, emotionless face that we shall forever recognise as Keanu and not the character he is supposed to be playing. The supporting cast is poor, as is the storytelling and camera-work in general. There is no saving grace to be found here, but I've awarded it two stars extra for decent production values.<br/><br/>In the end, I was glad to leave the theatre which it was shown, as were others as suggested by their sighs of disappointment. If you came to watch Keanu, watch. But if you came to be immersed in a world that tenders your soul, you'd be better off sticking to something else."

"Shakor77","9","3","9","4 February 2015"," Feels genuine but with some obvious flaws
","So I was a bit skeptical when I loaded up this movie as, although I like Keanu Reeves, he does not have much depth in his acting skills. In particular he has a hard time to properly express emotions and that is one of the flaws in this movie as well as there are some situations where he should have shown genuine rage but he does quite a poor job in doing that.<br/><br/>However, he does OK as a former hit-man in this Equalizer type of movie and for once it is not over a girl, well not directly anyway, but rather about a dog and a car. That does sound a bit weird but seeing as Keanu is supposed to play a cold- blooded hit-man who killed people for the smallest slight, it does feel believable that he goes on a rampage over it. Specially when you learn what that dog meant to him.<br/><br/>But, as Keanu's lack of acting skills are apparent, it is more than enough made up by the mobster boss Michael Nyqvist. He has really intense duologue's with both his son, played by Game of Thrones star Alfie Allen, who also plays his role really well and later on a dialogue with Keanu Reeves which was well played as well.<br/><br/>Other than that, there are some stupid Hollywood moments, such as the ending and the token strong-woman character (another hit-man in this case) who does not add much to the movie and exaggerated action scenes as well as the ""bad guy"" being too stupid to finish things off when he could. But overall I enjoyed this movie. It has a good mix of action, intensity and with some drama thrown in and a really nice supporting role played by the excellent Willem Dafoe and small, but equally excellent efforts, by John Leguizamo and Lance Reddick.<br/><br/>Warmly recommended but don't take it too seriously."
"Terri-Ann11","10","3","9","31 January 2015"," Great film.
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Great amount of action, acting is good. And Keanu flexing his martial arts moves that he clearly learnt for The Matrix. The only thing I was confused about was how he went after the Russians for just killing his dog and stealing his car. But... he explains that when with Viggo. The amount of strong actors in there is good. I was pleased the array of actors they picked. It is in no way a comedy, but there was a couple of moments where I laughed out loud!<br/><br/>I loved it. If you're not particularly picky with your action movies then this is for you.<br/><br/>If all you're going to do is pick at every like plot hole (and there are a couple) then I would suggest avoiding."

It's cool in every sense of the word. The use of the camera is very slick, and the texting gives it a cartoonish feel to it with suits the plot.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays this hardcore hit-man who goes on a wild rampage thru the Russian mafia after the kid of the boss kills Reeves' dog. So, not the most original plot. But as a action movie it's good.

"Vivekmaru45","4","6","24","16 January 2015"," Overrated - The Equalizer(2014) is a much better film than this one.
","Trust me. I have seen better revenge flicks than this one. Just to name a few: Charles Bronson's Death Wish(5 films in all), Death Sentence, Oldboy, Hard Boiled(John Woo), Leon: The Professional, Mission Impossible Part 1, Kickboxer, I Saw The Devil, The Fugitive, A Grande Arte(a.k.a. Exposure), Virtuosity, Rambo Trilogy, Die-hard Trilogy, Alien Quadrilogy, Tremors(Kevin Bacon), Sergio Leone's spaghetti western trilogy: A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad And The Ugly. <br/><br/>Revenge is a common plot devise in most action-thrillers. In this film an ex-hit-man called John Wick(Keanu Reeves) vows vengeance upon the man who murders the puppy which was bequeathed to him by his late wife. John will not rest until he kills him. This man is the son of Viggo Tarasov(Michael Nyqvist), head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York and John's former employer. Viggo immediately puts a bounty on John's head and hopes that he will be killed before he ever manages to get close to his son. He also employs Marcus(Willem Dafoe), member of the old guard of assassins to kill John Wick for a fee of two million dollars. <br/><br/>The action scenes in the film are pretty standard. I rather liked the scenes in The Equalizer than this film. Antoine Fuqua is much better action director than Chad Stahelski. I personally feel that John Woo would have been a better first choice director. Other candidates would be Luc Besson, Michael Mann, David Fincher, John Mctiernan, James Cameron. The late George P. Cosmatos was an awesome action film director as well will films like Rambo 2, Cobra, Of Unknown Origin, Leviathan, Shadow Conspiracy and Tombstone. <br/><br/>The casting is okay, but not as effective as to linger in one's memories. This is not a film I'd watch twice in my life. Maybe the plot itself was too predictable and shallow, the acting feeling-less and the background score not that effective.<br/><br/>The only good actor in the film is by far Michael Nyqvist who plays Viggo. His acting is a notch above that of Keanu Reeves. John Leguizamo, a great favorite of mine has a very small part in the film. He does well with the meager lines he has to say in the film. The most wasted actor in the film is Willem Dafoe. He fails to make an impact upon the film, and his character development was poor.<br/><br/>I have seen many good Keanu Reeves films: Speed, The Matrix Trilogy, Johnny Mnemonic, Little Buddha (1993 - a must see film). This film will be among the ones which I would not care to see again."

The plot is very simple and straightforward so my review will be comparable. John Wick experiences a series of unfortunate tragedies and consequently, he spends the rest of the movie delivering head shots to the men who were responsible. The simplicity of the plot is effective because it gives us plenty of time to focus on the action. And the action is where this movie shines. The martial arts and gun fighting provide eye candy like you've never seen. And the amazing stunt work is accompanied by flawless editing and directing. The guys who made this seriously knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>John Wick takes place in a dark and stylish Universe full of assassins and bounties.

"brycecarltonmac","8","2","5","10 February 2017"," Sensational, Ironic, and Even Touching
","I enjoyed the heck out of this. The irony and spareness of the storyline are some its best features. It successfully and succinctly establishes John Wick's character and why we should care without drawing out a melodramatic backstory. The film is quick and to the point much like its protagonist, yet creates a detailed and engrossing underworld of which I found myself wishing to see more. Every character is a bit of a cliché, but that's kind of the point. Stahelski is never self- conscious in the decisions he makes with the film which makes for a robust, yet focused action film. <br/><br/>As far as the acting, Keanu Reeves brings the believable and understated rage of a hit-man being forced out of retirement. While no one was going to win an Oscar for their performance, the cast was perfectly suited for the movie. Each actor embodied their role and appeared to truly inhabit the film's surreal and fantastical settings. Whoever cast the movie did a killer job (pun intended).<br/><br/>The action sequences are artful to the point of humor, which I think is great. The crisp and imaginative movements of John Wick could belong to a ballet of violence rather than an action film. It's like a less believable yet more impressive Jason Bourne, but I honestly think I'd rather watch John Wick any day.<br/><br/>At one point in the film, I had a complaint. I cannot detail too much without spoilers, but let it suffice to say that the pacing was off for a few scenes about three quarters of the way through but quickly pulled itself together before the end. <br/><br/>Lastly, I am tempted to respond to negative reviews but I am pretty sure John Wick would look at the couch critics disinterestedly for a few tense moments then turn his back and walk away knowing he was better than them. I do have to say though, for those persons wanting so-called ""realism"" then you should probably stick to documentaries, and even then..."
"shirifrnz","8","2","5","9 February 2017"," Pure unadulterated action
","John Wick - it's that kind of a character whose name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people.

Let's just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty awesome at that.<br/><br/>I can't think of anyone else to be John Wick other than Keanu Reeves, the guy's living the character on screen. The hand to hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn't too much noise, no Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you'd expect from a hit-man.<br/><br/>The cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.<br/><br/>It is a great action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it's course. So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie. You'd be glad."
"Aly200","8","2","5","28 January 2017"," One of the best action films of the last decade
","Did anyone expect this 2014 action thriller to be a success? The film took audiences and critics by storm with its exciting and tense action sequences, a strong leading performance by ""The Matrix"" star Keanu Reeves as well as a talented supporting cast, a simple yet memorable plot and masterful direction.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves does what he does best in this smashing success: speak little dialogue and kick ass by shooting and killing the bad guys. Playing a former hit-man who is thrown back into the game after young punks kill his beloved puppy dog and steal his car, Reeves is on top of his game. The actor brings his own A-game to the part as he plays the title character as brooding, mysterious and intelligent all rolled into a lethal combination. Reeves' John Wick is a man on a mission and is prepared with a deadly arsenal of weaponry to dispatch his enemies. <br/><br/>The film also boasts a talented supporting cast particularly from Michael Nyqvist as Russian mob boss, Viggo, Ian McShane as Wick's former boss, Winston (the actor will reprise his role in the sequel) and Willem Dafoe as Wick's old friend and ally, Marcus. The actors all bring their unique flavors from Nyqvist being a quietly sinister villain who will take down Reeves's John Wick at any cost, McShane brings a worldly wisdom and silent ruthlessness to keep his prize assassin alive and Dafoe brings his snarky quips and loyal friendship to Marcus who is unwilling to kill his old friend which of course leads to trouble. You can never predict what action some of the characters will take or where their true loyalties lie, but it is thrilling to watch and wait for. <br/><br/>The actions sequences are relentless and fast-paced without resorting to shaky cam tactics. Guns fire, blood flies, fisticuffs ensue, the colors are dark and vibrant and the motions are all frenetic. The stunts are well choreographed as the actors move through fight scenes with almost snake-like slickness while the camera angles are wide enough for us to take in the action and relish all the excitement."
"diego_bravi","9","2","5","27 January 2017"," I highly recommend this film
","John Wick had been out awhile and at first I had little interest in seeing it as, for me, Keanu Reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is. However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.<br/><br/>The movie had two ex-stunt men (one of which was Keanu Reeves' former stunt double) helming this film. This resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen. Also familiarity with Reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star. This left the film's action scenes clean, realistic, to the point, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>If I was going to break down the film's format, well it is of the ""semi-generic Punisher type, ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses"" type variety. It was 75% Japanese yakuza film, 20% Film Noir, and 5% video game. One stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus. At first I thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then I realized it was a choice made for the film. Normally this would annoy me slightly, and I suppose still did, as I am a big fan of depth of field, mise–en–scènes set ups (Citizen Kane is one of my favorite films). I came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of Eastern influences, in this case it was reminiscent of Zen ink and brush compositions, where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effect.<br/><br/>While Keanu sold the action pieces well, he wasn't asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range, which is just what the film required. He was pretty much perfect for this part if I had been for some reason been asked to recast this film, I would be hard pressed to find a better fit. This would have been right up Jason Statham's alley, however there is nothing more he could have added to it. There was something quietly instance about Reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with. Statham will always remind me of the character he played in Snatch, which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating. Rather, if I had my choice of an alternative, I would delve further into the Japanese gangster genre and extract Chow Yun-fat. Reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker. Chow Yun-fat would have been ten years older, but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the 'business'.<br/><br/>Speaking of performances, this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise. One of these performances that I was not overly fond of was that of Alfie Allen. You probably know him as the dickless Theon Greyjoy. He worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable, however I was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to. This brings me to another flaw of the film. Many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the John Wick challenge. A spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself, an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded John Wick killing stroke.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action. This easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014. Judged as just a movie, it is simple in story structure, but what it does it does very well."
"hankcsampson","5","2","5","17 January 2017"," You've seen this movie a thousand times.
","Films like John Wick always have me thinking, ""How does a movie like this ever get made and what better films are now still sitting on the shelf""? It's a big bundle of action movie clichés strung together and it doesn't take long to guess where this all will end. You watch and you think, ""I've seen this all before"". I wondered at some points if the movie was trying to spoof the genre because many of the action vignettes were trying so hard to be 'stylized' with long, choreographed fight sequences and bad music. I find it hard to understand what entertainment this movie would hold for an audience unless you enjoy watching bullets enter and exit heads with great regularity. Why are movie bad guys so stupid? Surely they've learned from watching James Bond films that you kill the protagonist when you have your chance instead of interrogating him first because we all know what happens then. And why are the baddies such poor marksmen? Perhaps they need to join John Wick's target range. Wick must take some powerful sedatives each night. I don't know how he'd sleep otherwise. Maybe Keanu has the same trouble after making this movie."

","JOHN WICK! You will remember that name! Ever since The Matrix left the theaters, people have been wondering if Keanu Reeves would make his return to the action world. After Man of Tai Chi came out last year people were wondering if the man in the black jacket was truly back, well I just came from seeing John Wick and to steal a line from the movie, ""ya, I'm thinking' he's back!"" You want the story, I'll spin it for you quick. It's been said that you don't mess with a man's car or his dog, well apparently, nobody told that to a young group of Russian mobsters who do so to the grief stricken John Wick. What the mobsters don't know is that although poor John might look like a scruffy nobody, he's actually a badass ex-assassin and his retribution is BA-HA-RUTAL! This is an action movie! like a REAL action movie! Not like those modern soldier/spy action movies. This is a straight up high octane muscle busting John Woo style shoot-em-up action movie! My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE kind of movie! It looks like Keanu is a little miffed that he wasn't called to be part of The Expendables team and in retaliation he made a badass movie of his own! The film is directed by stunt choreographers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski who, believe it or not, used to be stand-ins for Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving on The Matrix. Those two really know what they're doing because the cinematography in John Wick is clear, well shot and beautifully pieced together and the action is fluid, quick, incredibly violent but undeniably stylish and over the top which really makes it a lot of fun to watch. Plus, it exists in this interesting world of hit men and secret clubs and unspoken code that really pulls you in and makes you want to see more of what's REALLY going on behind the scenes. This is helped a lot by the movie's incredible cast which includes Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Lance Reddick and the mayhem guy from the Allstate commercials. It's the most fun I've had watching a ""one man one way"" movie in a good long while and if you're a fan of movies like Equilibrium or Hard Boiled or really any John Woo film at all, you'll love this! Have a dude's night with the guys you used to watched Jet Li, Steven Segal and Chow Yun-Fat movies with and SEE THIS MOVIE! John Wick gets a 4.5...out of 5."

","I didn't like the movie, it gave me cognitive dissonance. It is a professional work, it has perfect styling, the camera work is great, the individual scenes are believable and well shot but... it has no content.<br/><br/>The characters are shallow and don't grow. The action is predictable. The stereotypes are pure propaganda. It just feeels like somebody wasted not only the viewers money, but also hired the stars for nothing.<br/><br/>There is just no message.

"Tweekums","8","2","5","24 July 2016"," They stole his car; they killed his dog; now they are going to pay
","John Wick's life is not going well; his wife of five years has recently died and he is barely holding things together. Then he receives one final gift from his wife; a puppy. It looks as if this is just what he needed to pull himself together but soon afterwards a group of young punks break into his house and attack him while looking for the keys to his classic car they also kill the puppy. They also had no idea who they were messing with until Wick met his wife he was the top assassin working for a Russian mobster in New York. The thief's father is that same Russian gangster and if he is to save his son he will have to kill Wick first. The killers sent after Wick are soon dispatched and now he is on the warpath; everybody who gets in his way is going to end up dead and a lot of people get in his way.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a deep and meaningful story or even a sense of mystery you are likely to be disappointed with this; from the start we know who the bad guys are and we just know that before the film is over our protagonist will have killed them all along with countless heavies. If you want lots of action that feels real without obvious CGI, wirework, obviously choreographed fights and corny one-liners then this is just the thing. With its almost nonstop violent action it feels more like something John Woo would have made in his Hong Kong days than a typical Hollywood action movie. Keanu Reeves does an impressive job as Wick. Michael Nyqvist make a good bad guy and Alfie Allen is suitably unpleasant as his dog-killing son. They are also enjoyable turns from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane. My only real complaint about the film is that the subtitles that appeared when anybody spoke Russian were tiny and not at the bottom of the screen so that they weren't that easy to read before they vanished; that wasn't a major problem as this film is about action not dialogue. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody after a proper action movie."
"queenrose555","8","2","5","16 June 2016"," It was great!!! (coming from someone who doesn't like action movies)
","OK, first of all I don't like watching action movies, I only suffer through them for my husband. And he does know that I suffer through them, therefore, we don't watch them very often in our household. This movie I not only watched all by myself but enjoyed every minute of it! So why did I start watching it by myself in a first place? One evening I felt like watching myself some eye candy that is Reeves, so sue me. I was prepared, however, to stop it any minute I got tired of it.<br/><br/>Also, my first language is Russian; so yes, I get annoyed too when American/British/Australian actors try to pass of as Russian dudes, when I can't understand a single word spoken in awful Russian. But I watched many other movies where a) Russian guys are bad and/or stupid guys and b) speak incomprehensible Russian. Why should this particular movie be singled out? It's not the point!<br/><br/>As other reviewers noted, this whole movie is all about fun and pure entertainment. And when I do watch a movie, I want fun and entertainment: not to be depressed, shocked, and saddened out of my wits. Real life can do that sufficiently enough.<br/><br/>The first 20 or so minutes were depressing, but they went by fast and served as a backstory. After that...done! Enjoy the ride! I don't think I have ever seen such upbeat action movie where I found myself laughing on numerous occasions. And I agree, there is something Tarantino-esque about this movie but I actually thought that this movie was much better, as it dialed down the gore while keeping surreal atmosphere throughout.<br/><br/>In short, this is entertainment people! This is why we go to the movies in the first place! I am just getting sick and tired of all the ""art"" pieces portraying real word/life/struggles, etc which regrettably are more and more prevalent these days."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","5","2 December 2015"," Some of the best cinema fighting seen in a while
","Keanu Reeves has clearly found his niche as a brilliant martial arts actor, playing the role of various action heroes executing flawless and beautiful fight choreographies, taking names, shooting bad guys, breaking a few necks, et cetera. Absolutely nothing wrong with that and this, his most recent action film, is definitely worth a watch for the visuals alone.<br/><br/>John Wick (Reeves) is a retired assassin and hired gun, who has recently gone through an immense loss and is just getting back to his feet. Enter the son of a Russian mobster, young enough that he doesn't recognize this dark legend of the underworld. After an insult gone too far, John Wick once again feels the blood boiling within him and the rest of the film is pretty much nothing else but his one man war against the Russian mafia. And you know what? I don't really need anything else from the story. These kinds of revenge action films work because of their style and because of their characters. Sure, it's nice if the story has some surprising twists, but they don't really need it.<br/><br/>In this case the movie definitely has style, bucket loads of it. The fight scenes are phenomenally well-shot, well-choreographed and well-executed. Especially the first few. The film also manages to build nice mythos around its world. Like the gold coins these assassins use to pay for everything, or the whole code of conduct they all seem to operate under. Wick is a legend in the underworld and it's great to see him casually nodding to other killers and having them lift their hats in return. Small things like that really deepen the world considerably and make it interesting to follow.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, where the film falters a bit is the cast of characters. None of them are bad and most of them are played by talented actors, but they are pretty much text book as far as the writing goes. Stereotypical, failing to surprise and mainly there to move the plot from one action scene to another. Plus, while the actors are not bad by any means, none of them are what you would call A-list, with the exception of Reeves, and even he's a bit debatable nowadays. Well, okay, there's Willem Dafoe, but he's in a minor role.<br/><br/>All in all John Wick is definitely worth a watch for all fans of action, especially if you're into the martial arts and gun-fu subgenres."
"lesleyharris30","7","2","5","27 October 2015"," An Execellent Return to form for Keanu Reeves,
","John Wick is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast. It's a simple action movie that never wants to be anything more than that, it never gets too complicated, it's story is easy to follow and the action sequences are amazingly choreographed, it's a huge surprise to know that it's made by two first time directors, because they already seem like professionals. I felt the movie needed more depth, though I did certainly feel certainly feel for the main character, they glossed over the story about his wife, it should have been more constructed, it's only an hour and forty minutes long, and they easily could have added an extra fifteen minutes to develop their relationship some more. The performances are excellent, there are some top class acting from the likes of Michael Nyqvist, Willie Dafoe and Ian McShane, but the best performance certainly goes to Keanu Reeves, who shines in this film and, for the first time since the Matrix, he feels like a real action star, his characterisation for Wick is terrific, he's flawed, emotional and vengeful, it's a character that we can easily feel for and support. Action packed and a ton of simple fun, I would recommend John Wick to anyone looking for a good action. <br/><br/>A hit-man comes out of retirement in order to take down the men who took everything he loves away from him. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Keanu Reeves Worst Performance: Omar Barnea"
"SquigglyCrunch","7","2","5","13 October 2015"," A Solid, Original Action Movie
","I didn't expect much with this movie. Just another action film in which my easily impressed friend announced was his new favorite movie.<br/><br/>Turns out, it was actually pretty enjoyable. Sure it doesn't have a deep plot or interesting characters, but it has a twist on modern action movies that I haven't really seen. I don't want to spoil anything, but it was actually quite humorous. I found the over-the- top-ness to be quite entertaining. The action is good, nothing special though. Typical action movie action. EXCEPT! John Wick reloads his gun! That's right, this action movie is not only creative, but realistic! Now that's a rarity in action movies these days. <br/><br/>Overall, John Wick is different, and it scores points on that level. However, the ending was forced which really took away from the experience, and the action, plot, and characters really aren't anything special (except John Wick reloads), which is where it loses points. I understand that it's an action movie, but that doesn't excuse it from key points required in making a good movie. In the end, if your looking for a solid action movie, then John Wick is the movie for you."
"agsteribbe","7","2","5","13 October 2015"," Death wish 40 years later
","Basically this is a Charles Bronson death wish movie from the 70's redone for our times. There used to be a series of Bronson movies all literally the same. Something bad would happen to the main character and he would take revenge. That's it, and strangely enough that is enough for a movie to succeed even now.<br/><br/>Those kind of movies and this particular one, play on the feelings we all have when criminals take something away from us or we are physically or mentally attacked by someone. We want revenge, hatred roars in our minds and if we did not have the tiny layer of civilization and self control, the entire world would play out this revenge story again and again.<br/><br/>So there you have it, Reeves plays pretty well although with his usual poker face expression during most of the movie, someone takes his car and kills his dog and of we go on a 250 body count murder spree to kill the criminal. I should mention the dog stands for more than just an animal, it's a symbol of love.<br/><br/>Reeves must be carrying an ammo stock pile on his body that would have normal people unable to move, but if you disregard the ""i have myself 1200 bullets please"" it's an enjoyable if very violent 100 minutes.<br/><br/>I suspect there will be a John wick 2,3 and so on, as Hollywood has rediscovered Bronson revenge movies."
"Floated2","8","2","5","5 July 2015"," Lives Up to its Hype
","After hearing about the surrounded hype of John Wick, one must have been decided to see for themself how the film stacks up. And for one, I believe the film lives up to its hype. Having been called the best or one of the best action films of last year- 2014, it really does deliver on action and what makes the film standout, is the style and visuals. We have seen many action films in the past years but John Wick delivers and standouts due to its level of non-stop action and the way the action is being brought upon us. There have been plenty of action films with characters such as John Wick- highly secretive hit- man/detectives that play it cool, but in this film we see Keanu Reeves really play the part perfectly.<br/><br/>Like most films, especially like he Equalizer- another 2014 action film, this film has a great set up and it builds the suspension, but as the film gets past half way, it really does become a great entertaining ride. Like many, the action is a serious tone and it works well. The sequel will be very anticipated, and we all hope it delivers. Keep a steady eye out for it. We all know it will come upon us quickly."
"p-jonsson","9","2","5","24 June 2015"," Excellent, straightforward action movie without any unnecessary social and emotional nonsense.
","This is very much my kind of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick's very emotional response to his wife's death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with ""no emotional nonsense"" is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an ""ordinary"" guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn't go into some silly ""oh should I really pull the trigger"" trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guyseventually that is.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pi--ed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick's former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.<br/><br/>Then of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it  so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.<br/><br/>One thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pi--ed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or ""obligatory"" scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is ""the bad guys will pay"" all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pi--ed off.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday."
"Alenbalz","4","2","5","17 June 2015"," Not even John Wayne
","If you love fast paced action, where the hero recovers from numerous crippling assaults and stabbings, (that would kill any bad guy) faster than you can say Jack be Nimble... this is the movies for you. Story line is very very simple, acting mediocre, but fully action paced to the hilt. Our hero, kills at least 84 bad guys, including the 'Big Boss' and effectively takes out the whole Russian Mafia: All because the Big Boss' son kills his dog and steals his car. Our hero makes Superman, Batman and Spider-Man look like kindergarten babes as he wisks through more than 80 thugs and trained killers and underworld henchmen like a 300km/hr tornado. The movie starts off with our hero collapsing (you think he dies) due to a mortal stomach wound, then it flashes back to fill in the intervening events, and ends with our hero rising like a Phoenix out of the ashes, as good as new (almost) for what could only be a the first step towards a future sequel. After beating and killing over 80 trained and ruthless mobsters, our hero is given a very good hiding by a female assassin, just hours after he was patched up from a previous almost fatal beating and stabbing. and a day or two later, the only way he can disarm and beat a much older (and nowhere near as fit or capable as our hero) Crime Boss is to let the crime boss stab him in the pre-existing stomach wound so he could take the knife off him and stab/kill him; perhaps this is where our hero's batteries were running low.Though not all is far fetched fantasy because this is one of a very few movies where the hero's gun runs out of bullets as any normal gun would, and we do see him reloading a few times. Apart from the miraculous recoveries (more than once) of our hero, the movie does have some somber or comical scenes to break up the voluminous killings, like when our hero goes to a classy hotel (akin to a sanctuary or demilitarized zone, where only assassins, hit men and criminals are allowed entry, to gather, stay and unwind or just take a breather from their hectic routine), with very stringent rules where any transgression carries an immediate death sentence: as ones greedy guest discovers. And for the car enthusiasts, our hero does do some very impressive driving/pursuit scenes. Pity because with a bit of toning down on the outlandish stunts and super recovery from serious injuries, this could have been a much better film."
"luke-a-mcgowan","7","2","5","31 January 2015"," Uneven and long but plenty of good ingredients
","John Wick might be the most uneven film I've seen in 2014. The premise is good and the film well-constructed but the pacing is poor. It takes far too long for the action to kick in. The first hour is all setup, with characters repeatedly telling each other (and the audience) that John Wick is really tough. However, it takes forever for us to actually see this, with only one good action sequence in the first hour. When the action finally kicks in, its pretty glorious, but it overstays its welcome in the final act. With one dramatic fight scene after another, towards the end John Wick feels too much like a video game, with the protagonist simply proceeding through enemies like levels.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves reminds us in the overlong opening act why producers and directors don't hire him for his acting talents. Fortunately, once the first hour has dragged on, he reminds us why we do hire him - he's a complete badass who at 50 plus years old is absolutely still in his prime. Dean Winters and Alfie Allen are excellent casting additions, though not exactly for acting talent, but for the presence they bring to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick is a nice time-killer and most promisingly, constructs a world I would love to revisit (in a better paced sequel)."

It felt like a 70s grind house action thriller. <br/><br/>Then came the video game carnage. Scene after scene of underworld minions getting shot in the face at point blank range. I'm sorry. I walked out at the hour mark. I realize I missed a cool car chase at the end - and that sucks. But I'm just tired of it. Tired, tired, tired. Tired of gun violence in movies, man. It's not just morally objectionable, it's just not exciting, it's just boring. So depressing to see Keanu involved in this kind of project. What really pisses me off too is when critics give lousy ratings to Tyler Perry movies which have nothing but positive messages and then lavish praise on this movie which is nothing but casual throw-away gun violence from beginning to end. Oh yes, but it's so stylish. Yeah right."
"victoriaxy","3","4","15","22 January 2015"," John Wick The Musical
","My friends sat me down to watch this movie last night. I thought it was going to be another stupid action flick. Boy, was I wrong!<br/><br/>Here is my review: <br/><br/>JOHN WICK was a wonderful, lighthearted romp for my hour and a half on the couch. I loved the cute puppy scenes, the 1969 Mustang, and the stylish suits Mr. Wick wore on the elegant sets. What a total surprise that Keanu could mug, joke, and sing so well. He mostly danced with men from the Russian Ballet Troupe, and the choreography was first rate! His performance could easily rival Fred Astaire and shows the world Mr. Reeve can do so much more than his previous ""dead as a stick"" acting skills.<br/><br/>It was mostly a man's musical. Three women had minor roles. His deceased wife was glimpsed in brief flashbacks. There was a girl tending bar who had a few lines of dialogue. And lastly there was Adrianne Palicki, who had only one short pas de deux and chanson duet with John Wick.<br/><br/>Mr. Reeve's best song was ""I'm Thinking I'm Back."" This was easily the most grammy winning piece in the entire musical.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the snappy dialogue. I mean it! I was clutching my sides with laughter at all the witty repartee among the actors. The script writers could certainly teach Woody Allen a thing or two. <br/><br/>I would have given this movie 10 stars, but I gave it only 3 for ending way too soon. It should have gone on much, much longer. <br/><br/>The final dance number on the docks near the helicopter pad was pure romance and reminiscent of Gene Kelly in the pouring rain.<br/><br/>With all the mindless American action movies featuring nonstop ultraviolence, it was refreshing to see the film makers treat us with an upbeat musical comedy. Afterwards I felt like Audrey Hepburn and started singing ""I Could Have Danced All Night""."

Amongst the abundance of them comes John Wick with its on location feel and slick action sequences. <br/><br/>Wonderfully directed by Chad Stahelski & David Leitch's with great action scenes and Derek Kolstad's solid dialogue Wick goes from one scene to the next exacting revenge on those who have wronged him. Its a fine straightforward affair without the quirkiness or humour of the likes director Guy Ritchie or Paul McGuigan. Stahelski delivers a straight up action thriller with hard hitting violence, blood baths through a hotel, church, cars and blood spattered clubs. Unashamedly from the shootouts to knife fights it oozes cool, complemented by the lighting, sound design, music tracks and score from Tyler Bates.<br/><br/>The cast are unprecedentedly on form with Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki and memorable Willem Dafoe. Bridget Moynahan and Ian McShane cameo with John Leguizamo small part effortlessly stealing the cameo show. Keane Reeves is perfectly cast with his minimal dialogue and screen presence. <br/><br/>Even with its dark tone it's more fun than the comparable excellent Equalizer. Yes, like all actions there's an obligatory Jason Statham/Van Damme-like showdown/fight off and John Wick is unavoidably reminiscent of Get Carter and Payback but as a revenge action it is as completely rounded as they come - recommended."

","I can't say I understand why many people are raving about John Wick. Is it that people's expectations are so low these days? Maybe it's because the film is reminiscent of The Matrix and because it features refreshing old-school action choreography. Sure, it seems like with the character of John Wick, Keanu Reeves is back to his glory days of Speed (1994) and The Matrix (1999). But this alone doesn't make for a good film. John Wick is an often enjoyable action movie, but there's nothing original about it. Gone are the days of bright upbeat action movies like Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Lethal Weapon (1987) and Under Siege (1992). Yes, those days seem so far away now. Today we have to watch dark, depressing and truly violent action movies like John Wick and The Equalizer. If you want to see action in an upbeat movie now you have to watch a special-effects summer blockbuster. But, to be fair, John Wick does contain some humor, the cinematography by Jonathan Sela is impressive, some of the action scenes are truly entertaining, and that movie poster of Keanu with a gun sure does look cool. In fact, sometimes the film reminds one of the glory days of action movies. Reeves is confident in the leading role. Michael Nyqvist seems to be enjoying himself as Viggo Tarasov, the film's main antagonist. In addition, most of the supporting cast are good, though there isn't a single character that I found interesting. Director and stunt veteran Chad Stahelski refuses to embrace the post-Bourne Identity (2002) trend of shaky-cam action. That's commendable but the action choreography is still unremarkable even if it is competent. John Wick can kill people without problems. If the character had been infused with more style, however, and provided with more of a personality the film would have been more enjoyable. Derek Kolstad's traditional and predictable screenplay also drags the film down. When Wick goes on his vengeful killing spree he begins with the pawns and works his way up to the head of the crime syndicate. So, even though John Wick is mostly a competent action movie, there's nothing in it that can elevate it to the status of a classic. I don't recommend it, but if you're in the mood to see an action movie you may like it."

","Seriously, what was it? IMDb 7.7, RT 70% - for THIS? Even Keanu Reeves can not save this lousy script, hard-to-believe story, bad and pathetic dialogs. Main character doesn't talk much, it suits Keanu perfectly, he probably took this role for personal reasons, as he loose someone close himself. But it doesn't mean, You should watch it and pay for it. If you love Keanu Reeves and cannot stand it - buy the DVD, watch online, save your money. This movie is really boring and disappointing, it doesn't worth much of your money and time. Well, you've been warned.<br/><br/>About movie itself - John Wick was doing killings for the Russian mob, but met a woman and quit. Couple of years after, she died, leaving him with a dog and a car. Car was stolen, dog was killed, and now he takes revenge from the same Russian mob. Do you believe it so far? OK, this it where action starts, plenty of it. I've spent only a couple of months for studying some martial arts, but even this was enough to say - action was unprofessional, inefficient, it took him longer then should, it was staged and unbelievable, even gun part. Real disappointment, especially from Keanu Reeves. Bad script, bad dialogs, bad acting, bad action. Almost B-bad. Leaves us Just Keanu Reeves."
"Scarecrow-88","7","4","16","1 November 2014"," John Wick
","I'll say this about John Wick, this sure wasn't boring! The plot set up is ridiculous and laughable. A dog's death--and animal lovers may just get behind this (me realizing this as I write it)--fuels the rage of a former hit-man named John Wick (Keanu Reeves in a role tailor made for him), known to as the man you call to ""kill the boogeyman"". Wick had left behind a trail of dead bodies, a life where he perfected the art of the execution. A man he worked for, a Russian crimelord named Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist, of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series), unfortunately has an entitled punk kid named Josef (Alfie Allen; Game of Thrones) who seems to look for trouble and has been coddled by his pops to the point that he is burdened to clean up his messes. When Josef sees John parked by a gas tank pumping for a 69 Mustang, he wants it and, along with a couple of his crook cronies, home invade Wick, taking the keys of the car and killing his cute pet dog (purchased for John by his dying wife as a parting gift so he wouldn't be all alone). So Wick, furious and seething with rage, will wage a one-man war against any of Viggo's hired thugs and hit men (or hitwoman as one case arises) that gets in his way of executing Josef. Because Josef is such a creep, seeing him narrowly escaping Wick who must destroy an army of Russian henchmen, it is hard to imagine even Viggo would be so inclined as to relinquish so much in favor of saving the piece of human excrement. Yet family means somethinguntil Wick has a grenade gun pointed at him! Viggo hires Willem Dafoe's Marcus to take out Wick, but he instead winds up rescuing him twice from narrow demise. Dafoe, just to tell you, is rather wasted in his role, but with Ian McShane (as the owner of an exclusive hotel for a particularly criminal clientèle), Bridget Moynahan (as the wife who dies from cancer, supposedly ""taken by God because of Wick's life of murder for money""), and John Leguizamo (as the owner of a car shop that seems to operate illegal chop shopping) all make brief appearances as folks Wick encounters or knows. McShane's character has eyes and ears that could very well assist Wick on his journey because rules within his ""Continental"" were not met (Adrianne Palicki of the Friday Night Lights television show is a hitwoman who accepts a contract that would urge her to break the code held for anyone within the confines of the hotel to not practice within this ""safe zone"") and it was because of Viggo this was usurped. So Wick has friends that will help him on his mission.<br/><br/>With plentiful gun violence and lots of John Woo-stylized gunplay within martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, ""John Wick"" rarely takes a breath once it gets going. It starts dramatically and once Josef does what he does, the film takes off and remains a body count actioner the rest of the way. With a determined face that has a lot of ticked off aggression barely contained, Reeves recovers some of that old action star mojo that was missing in the big budget flop, ""47 Ronin"". The film does absolutely nothing newsimply put, Reeves, with guns, fighting skills, knives, and speed, cuts a swath through a lot of men, leaving a mess of bodies in his wake. I think the first major sequence—in Wick's home when Viggo sends some men to kill him—shows Wick kill about 20 men in like three or four minutes. Oh, just wait until you see him in the Red Circle clubViggo has a lot of bought ""protecting bodyguards"" that service the film as gun fodder. Not to let cars go to misuse, we see lots of vehicular carnage where men don't fare well as open targets on foot (or inside the car). It doesn't matter if men are up close or at a distance, Wick can put down targets with relative ease and barely flinch. It is like watching a shoot-em up video game. Wick is a bad ass who drops human targets of all shapes and sizes from all directions. You enter his orbit or within his line of sight (and are an enemy threatening his mission), your ass is grass. If this is of interest to you, check the film out. Don't expect to receive a cerebral dramatic work of artthis ain't it. But Wick will not only shoot you in the eyeball or forehead, he'll make sure to punch you in the larynx or break your arm before doing so."

He is a stone cold killer. He doesn't care about taking lives. It is just another day. And that is why the premise works. He is emotionless until this moment. And then when he actually feels something it is taken away. And now there is going to be hell to pay. People have asked what's the big deal it is just a dog and a car? That is what makes it make even more sense. watch it. It is the best Keanu movie he has made in a very long time. You won't be disappointed.

","Having watched ""The equalizer"" just over a few weeks ago, I couldn't help analyzing the similarities both these films share together. While both films serve well the purpose to kill time when you have got nothing special in mind, needless to say both movies are easily forgettable. Neither of the movies offer griping story, stunning performance or brutal action. In my opinion ""John Wick"" is slightly more entertaining. For one, Keanu's character is somewhat more developed and believable as a hit-man returned from retirement. Two, there is also a parallel storytelling of underworld structure and code. And three, John Wick has got style. However, if you are in a mood to see bloody violence, go watch The raid 2."
"harsh-kabeer","7","3","11","1 December 2014"," As personal as it can get!
","John Wick is a well made action movie that does not consist of big explosion and bigger sets. Most of its action pieces rely heavily on close combat and gun. It is stylishly and sleekly done with a tormented Keanu Reeves at the centre of things. The choreographed action sequences are very much close and personal with the brutality of every shot fired and every blow landed resonant in the shots. The directors who were formerly stunt directors have infused variety in the settings in which the action takes place and keep the action flowing. And one thing that really got me interested was how the movie weaves a community of thugs, smugglers, assassins and mob bosses. It seems as if it is altogether a different world with its own set of laws, ethics, codes and loyalties. Since the story is an internal one happening in the underbelly of New York city, this is the only world you get to see and it is intriguing and fascinating, so much like our world and so much unlike ours driven by our desire to survive and thrive. John Wick is the kind of action movie that is rare to find nowadays. If you like some old fashioned vendetta movie and love to see Keanu Reeves kicking some asses, this is the movie for you!"

Unfortunately, this is one of the worst action movie among the ones I've seen!
Ordinary, full of cliche, lack of aesthetic and far from a solid story.
Do we have to suppose that being heartbroken and agonised (film tells sources of these emotional accumulation in 2-3 minutes) is an enough motivation to kill numbers of men? Does this motivation provide any profoundness to the movie? Is the director aware of the wizards like Tarantino, Besson, Scott etc?"

","95 percent of this movie is fine. Decent cast, lots of action, plenty of killing & cool cars. <br/><br/>What ruins this film is a beginning that dispels our suspension of disbelief that Mr. Wick is a highly skilled, super bad-ass assassin, which is required for us to believe he is capable of killing so many serious soldiers against crazy odds. I mean, like two of the weaker guys, kicked his ass & killed his dog, with no difficulty or resistance. Yea, he got blindsided & clobbered, but a lot less than in the rest of the movie, and the character we see from then on, would have dispatched them both in 10 seconds & saved his puppy, but then it would be a slightly different plot, with the Mobster Pop going after Wick for killing his son in the beginning, instead of both going after each other.<br/><br/>Then there's the ending! This dog lover, who kills 77 people to avenge his murdered pal, goes and steals a Pit Bull puppy from a veterinarian's office, which I'm pretty sure in the ignorant & lazy minds of the writers, director & producers, meant it to be a rescue of a pup in need. This was a beautiful, healthy, blue Pit Bull puppy in a cage at a vet's office, not a sickly, abused, un-adoptable animal at a high kill animal shelter. I muse in the discussion boards, that in the next installment, the Pit Bull puppy's owner goes after John Wick to avenge his stolen pet.<br/><br/>I'm not saying don't watch it, but there are better things to do, places to go & movies & TV to see, like re-watching two episodes of Game Of Thrones, any season."

"Relkinlaw","10","2","6","10 August 2016"," John Wick must lose himself in order to find himself
","KR is brilliant in this ambiguous, deep and strangely moving film. Like DW in the Equalizer, KR has risen above the amoral, dirty ""business"" of assassins whose job it is to keep Hell filled with souls. He had his most profound hopes fulfilled by Brigitte Moynahan, who, significantly, is not in the film. She appears only in KR's memories so that he can perhaps maintain a connection with the pure life of joy he had in this world. Moynahan is symbolic of Dante's Beatrice, his ideal woman, residing in Heaven who guides Dante to paradise. But, before Wick is able to mourn the loss of his Beatrice, sick, sycophantic, arrogant yet pathetically weak urchins invade his home and kill his sweet beagle, sent by his dying wife, called daisy, which his Beatrice has sent so as to allow him to go on and believe in the beauty of this world. When this last vestige of purity is torn from him, however, he descends to the twisted, almost phantasmagorical life of darkness and death in which assassins (and their minions) reside. In order to return, he must dig up his tools and his coins, symbolic of his past life as an assassin having been sent down to hell. He had been reborn, only to die when he buries Moynahan. The dramatis personae he meets during his descent to the world of death are likened to the souls who come to the shore of the Styx river to be ferried by Charon and was then miraculously returned to life. The burial of daisy faintly suggests the Greek God of fertility, the opposite of Charon. The portrayal of the assassins is shot in the light of suspended disbelief, symbols of those who take life, descend to hell, and buy their way back to the real world. The imagery is brilliant and never misses a beat. All of the assassins strangely want him to return as if he is Lucifer himself, and they express joy (and legitimate fear) that he is ""back""--e.g.,the ""cleaner,"" the Concierge at the Continental, whose name is Charon because the producer knew that the audience needed the symbolism ""dumbed down"". KR was apparently the best of all, each of them must admit, but the question that tortures them is why he has returned--they have never tasted the purity of real life--so, has he returned because the ""real"" world could not satisfy, or is it the ""reality"" of the assassin's dreamworld that has drawn him back? This is the tension which is played out on the edge of a knife. The images of the film pass from real to dreamlike and back again; one has to reorient and accept that both are false. The assassins consider themselves ""Professionals"" while, KR, who has perspective on this murderous world, knows their evil nature. The coins used by the assassins as their only currency and are a brilliant allusion to the Ferryman, Charon of Greek myth, who is paid to ferry the deceased across the river Styx to Paradise. The coins are used exclusively by assassins in place of ""money"" because, fundamentally, these trained assassins don't need money--since money is only valuable in this world--and Charon does not take but a coin for his ferry. They need the coin, for that is their lot in life, to need to traverse the river. In a campy scene, KR finds a puppy again, in an unnecessary ""hit the audience over the head"" image, signifying his return to this world after banishing death from this world."

","My throwback Thursday isn't going so far back. Only to last year of early April when the anticipated John Wick was released. I don't think it got the recognition it deserves here in the UK being released more than six months after the US date in September 2014. I remembered seeing the trailers back in early 2014 and was fortunate enough to be excited enough to catch it at the cinema when it was finally released here, which only lasted about two weeks. <br/><br/>There's so much to love about this film, the comic book style mythology, the gunplay, the muscle cars and the actually lack of script. It has a strong cast and also boost a superb soundtrack and score from Tyler Bates and Le Castle Vania. Tracks like M86's ""In My Mind"" and Marilyn Manson's ""Killing Strangers"" suit the film perfectly. The film just oozes style and cool along with ultra-violence. <br/><br/>The title character is superbly introduced by allowing us to meet John Wick before the urban legends unearth around him. All because of that classic ""don't know who you're messing with"" premise, Wick automatically earns that hard-case personal of someone you really don't want to upset. Similar to characters like Taken's Bryan Mills and The Equalizer, retired, he's someone that just wants peace and quiet, until a situation awakens that dormant volcano of violence. <br/><br/>We meet other characters of the Wick's world and quickly understand that people either, like, respect or fear John Wick, possibly all three at the same time. The local police, doormen, and other underworld business proprietors. Pretty much everyone that matters, knows who and what John Wick is, and only the ultra brave and equally stupid go up against him. He's the Baba Yaga of course, but not exactly the boogeyman. <br/><br/>Michael Nyqvist (Ghost Protocol, The Girl With.. Series) is the Russian mob boss with Game of Thrones Alfie Allen as his idiotic son who makes the fatal mistake of stealing Wick's car, gives him a beating and kills his puppy unknowing who Wick is, evoking a path of carnage. We meet chop-shop John Leguizamo, waste disposal David Kelly Patrick (The Crow, Commando) the cool Continental Hotel owner Ian McShane and resident doctor, Matrix's Keymaker Randall Duk Kim. Not forgetting fellow sniper Willem Dafoe. <br/><br/>As with a lot of Keanu's movies there is a lack of script, but it works! Sometimes answering with silences that gives more impact than the telephone tough guy pitch. It enforces the idea that there's so much brewing under that black suit of his. I have always been a firm believer that letting other people boast about your abilities is more effective than it coming from horse's mouth. This is a classic example. <br/><br/>It's a directorial debut for stunt/fight coordinator/double Chad Stahelski who's worked on The Matrix series, 300 and even the more recent Captain America: Civil War. Which would explain the action, the bullet ballets and realistic punch-ups. It's raw fighting, nothing fancy or over- the-top and uses military grade tactics. Keanu doing most if not all of the stunts. <br/><br/>John Wick is fast becoming a cult film with a stream of fans awaiting the announced sequel. Keanu Reeves has done what Brandon Lee did with The Crow (1994) in fact I only discovered writing this that director Stahelski got his break doubling for Lee after the tragic accident. I've even dressed my GTAV avatar to look like him, with matching cars.

What if you cut everything that the movie didn't need - the love interest, the convoluted plot, and the moralizing? What's left is a pure action movie without anything it doesn't need. They knew people liked choreographed action sequences and they filled the movie with plenty of them. In subtle ways, it makes advances in the genre. For example, notice how characters react when they hear the name - ""John Wick."" They're instantly terrified. The one thing that I wanted that the film didn't give me was something truly original.

","A heart-racing action thriller movie starring Keanu Reeves as the main antagonist; John Wick follows the path of a recent widower who's trained assassin past is reborn as Russian thugs steal his car and destroy the gift his late wife left him to be remembered by. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity, a combination of fluid fight scenes and an epic soundtrack, headlined by Marilyn Manson's 'Killing strangers', creates the tense feeling of a blockbuster action movie. Despite having a relatively straight forward plot, it works sufficiently in setting up a situation where the rest of the greatness can happen - stylized and awesome fight sequences where John Wick goes through multiple kills in a short period of time- most noticeably within the Red Circle Nightclub where Wick's ability to perform multiple head shots is displayed expertly, combining all stereotypical action movie elements whilst raising the bar substantially. Wick's path of vengeance sees him rest at a hotel for international assassins whilst one by one eliminating the enemies which stand in his way and the companions of his target 'Iosev' (Viggo's son). Willem Dafoe, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick all lead a noble supporting cast. Michael Nyqvist was made to play villains, as seen as the razor sharp Viggo portrayed in John Wick. Compared to films such as Taken, John Wick doesn't reinvent the notorious revenge action-thriller genre, but contributes massively as one of the best action films seen in the last few years. John Wick has laid the foundations for a highly anticipated action franchise and fans of the movie won't have to wait long, as the sequel will be released in 2017. Subsequently, this good intentioned assassin film is a must watch and is overall a stand out film amongst its competitors. Let's hope 'the man you send to kill the boogeyman' can top his performance in the sequel."

","Hearing nothing but good things about the sleeper action film John Wick (2014), I figured the high praise was enough give this one a go. Let me start by saying, nothing in this movie disappoints. The premise is ridiculous, the flick knows it's off the rails, and what makes it work is that it simply does not care what you think. The people behind the revenge picture might as well have added a disclaimer that reads: ""Sit down. Shut up. Enjoy."" And with that being said, (Holy Body Count!) was this a non-stop Funfest. (Even my Lady liked it. That's saying something.)<br/><br/>John Wick (Reeves) starts off as a sympathetically stoic widower having a tough time dealing with the loss of his ailing wife (Moynahan). Keeping to himself, very little is given about his back-story, other than he has a sweet ass car and an adorable new puppy. At times the opening feels like they were going for the sappy levels we succumbed to in the gut wrenchingly somber intro of Up (2009). But that all comes to a screeching halt once the son of a Russian mob boss (Allen) takes an unhealthy interest in Wick's car while filling up at a gas station (Word to the wise, don't mess with another man's ride.). After breaking into his home and stealing (amongst other horrific acts) the beloved vehicle, much (MUCH) more is of Wick's past life slowly simmers to the surface and eventually leads to an all out boil-over of who this relatively quiet man truly was. And it just keeps getting better from there.<br/><br/>This movie was drag out, blood and guts, slam-bam (add more silly terms at your leisure) from the end of Act One on and it doesn't let up until the final shot. Normally, this can be tedious and ineffective, but the world that opens up to the viewer is so well crafted that it leaves the audience clamoring for more. The supporting cast is amazing as well, dropping familiar faces into this gumbo of awesome at a steady, but not over saturated, pace. Rough, gritty, and self aware of it's coo-coo bananas plot, the filmmakers put together a production that comes with a slick polish all the while throwing everything they could at the screen without apology. I haven't seen a movie this confident in a crazy premise since Jason Statham ran amok in Crank (2006)"

","The only thing I can say about this movie is: AWESOME The whole buildup as to why Wick started to kill in the first place might seem a bit stupid but you forget the reason soon after he started. The assassins code, the hotels, the coins. Only when you watch you will get all of this but I have to say, you will be amazed at the wonderful and classy world they have built for the assassins. T There is not much to say honestly, Im not a professional reviewer but Im very hard to please when it come to action movies, this one is beautiful but also actionable. You wont loose anything watching it. And when you watched it, for a day or so, you will think and think about the world they built up, how amazing it would be to live in that world. The backstory they hint, oh the backstory. They give you hints and tips about Johns past which just makes you keep wondering and wondering about everything and keeps you wanting a followup to this movie"

","Very lousy acting and poor plot that makes me remember the old school shoot' em up games full of weapons, bullets and muscle cars.<br/><br/>The lack of connection between the different parts make of this movie a patchwork with its incongruous parts and elements. I cant even compare this movie with Taken because the two are in completely different levels starting by the acting and the plausibility of Neeson's character compared to Wick. I enjoyed Taken in opposition to this very disappointing movie.<br/><br/>Empty of substance, this movie relies only on the main actor and a lot of random violence to give you something that in my opinion its not worth your precious time."

","This movie is the beginning of a franchise. And an almost perfect film in and of itself. There is so little dialogue in this film but this is not a bad thing. It gives you a break from the exposition heavy origin stories that are so tiring. The action starts from minute one and never stops. The editing, set design, and acting let you know everything you need to know. We don't need back story, we don't need exposition, we know how bad ass John Wick is in every scene he's in. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves shines more than any film he's ever been in. He's more bad ass than in the Matrix, more likable than in Constantine. This is the role he was born to play. Woah. He's the anti-hero we've all been waiting for him to play and he does it with aplomb. He's an unabashed killer and you will be rooting for him every second of the way. <br/><br/>John Wick is the boogeyman."
"Equalizer16","8","2","6","3 October 2015"," Absolutely delivers, is cool, and admirable.
","Although this viewer has not seen many other works of Reeves, I can see he is an experienced actor, getting himself back into the big films. Reeves stars in the all-out action packed John Wick. The film shows the events of an ex hit-man who comes out of retirement to seek revenge on the Russian mafia, who stole his last chance to find solace in his grief over his late wife.<br/><br/>The film is filled with non-stop violence, which presents Reeves' Matrix acrobatic skills as he takes down highly trained assassins. What make the film most fun is how the violence is shown. For example the acrobatic skills and moves performed by Reeves is very admirable and exciting. To add style to it as well Reeves also pulls the trigger by wearing very smart suits which makes the action very clean.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film does not resort to all elements of a typical action film: the girl, the archenemy, and frequent defeats. The film also displays beautiful cinematography, and stunning visual effects.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story is all not fixed, to me the film felt like the middle of a story, lacking an introduction, and a revolving ending. Also Reeves performs more with his body and less with his voice, which weakens the actor's performance. The film is also very cold and dark which gives the audience the same feeling.<br/><br/>To all dog lovers, the first 15 minutes of this film is not for you. To action enthusiasts, this film completely delivers.<br/><br/>To summarise, John Wick is not a 'must see' but a cracking good watch, and is the action of the year."
"leonblackwood","6","2","6","27 September 2015"," Brilliant action, sketchy storyline! 6/10
","Review: After listening to all of the hype surrounding this movie, I'm glad that I finally got to watch it! The plot was a bit weird but I enjoyed the Matrix style, gun tooting action. The last few Keanu Reeves movies have shown a moody side to his acting, compared to the earlier days of Bill & Ted and I must admit, I'm kind of liking it. His no nonsense demeanor really worked as John Wick but there script was a bit sketchy. Anyway, the movie is about a ex- assassin who has recently lost his wife and become a recluse in his house with his dog, which his wife got delivered to him after she passed away. Whilst filling up his car at a petrol station, some Russian gangsters offer him money for his car but he kindly turns them down and he goes on his way. This is were the plot was a bit weak in my opinion! For some random reason, the Russian gangsters turn up at his house and they beat him up, take his car and kill his dog. I was hoping that there was going to be a twist in the story which would make that aspect make sense but they were just being total out of order. Anyway, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) decides to go on a killing rampage, trying to get to the culprit who killed his dog but he has to go through the Russian mafia which puts his life in danger, along with his close friends. The storyline is pretty straight forward but there are a few elements that were a bit sketchy to me. Now, he's supposed to be an untouchable assassin who people call the ""Boogeyman"" but he was getting beat up, near to death in most of the action scenes. I don't know if the director was trying to make it seem realistic or not, but the way that some of the characters was describing John Wick is yet to be seen. OK, he was going around by himself causing havoc in New York but if it wasn't for Willem Dafoe, he would have died a few times in the film. With that aside, I did like the action scenes and the whole dark, intense feel to the film really worked. There definitely has to be a sequel because the John Wick character is really needed in Hollywood at the moment. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I really can't believe that Keanu Reeves is 51 and it's now that he's decided to become a action hero. I suppose it's after all the training from the Matrix movies! Anyway, his movie career started in 1986 in the popular Youngblood, ice hockey movie with Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze but he really hit the big time with the Bill & Ted movies in 1989. After getting branded as a comedic actor, which he didn't like, he decided to turn to action movies with Point Break in 1991 and Speed in 1994. In between those movies he took the lead in Bram's Stokers Dracula, which didn't go down well with the critics because of his accent and Little Buddha which also was a bit of a failure but he bounced back with the Devil's Advocate and, of course, the Matrix trilogy. Since then, he has struggled to find a genre that he was comfortable with and he starred in various movies like Hard Ball, Sweet November and the Gift. Constantine had mixed reviews along with Scanner Darkly, which was a brand new way of filming and then he came out with two disappointing films which were Generation Um... and Henry's Crime. Recently he has turned to action movies like Man Tai Chi, which he directed, 47 Ronin and, of course, this movie, which he plans to star in a sequel. In total, his movies have grossed nearly $3Billion so he has had a impressive career to date. He's never been comfortable around the whole Hollywood scene but he has proved to be a bankable star, even though he doesn't like to admit it. Anyway, this film was directed by Chad Stahelski whose done the stunts in over 70 movies which include Point Break, the Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2, Die Hard 4, Rambo, X Men, Iron Man 2, the Expendables, Tron Legacy, Sherlock Holmes and the Hunger Games so he really does have a impressive portfolio when it comes to stunt coordinating. This is his first movie in the directing chair and after its success, he plans direct the sequel, hopefully with a meaningful storyline. Anyway, for his first project, I was quite impressed with the result and I can't wait to see John Wick causing more havoc again.<br/><br/>Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $79million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/thrillers about a ex-assassin who seeks revenge after Russian gangsters kill his dog and steal his car. 6/10"
"wdllofzepia","9","2","6","26 September 2015"," Finally an unapologetic action movie
","I didn't know what I was going to get when I bought this on BR. Sure Keanu is cool, some times, and so is Mr Dafoe. But what about the rest? What about the story? This isn't a sci-fi or fantasy movie where Keanu seems to pick good ones.<br/><br/>So, what is this movie? It's a 2010s version of a 1980s revenge/action movie. It gets bloody soon enough and stays that way till the end. You are not going to have much to ""think"" about. In fact the only thing I would constantly do while watching this was smiling with satisfaction for the action I was watching in a movie. <br/><br/>What was more impressive about it, was that at no point it felt boring, as many action movies do even when they have lots of...action. <br/><br/>Probably unnecessary warning, but, this is not for the young ones. It gets VERY violent and graphic, all the time. <br/><br/>I rarely place a movie in my favorite list, especially if it is an action movie, but oh my this is one good solid entertainment piece!"
"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","6","2","6","6 September 2015"," Worth a watch but pointless and exasperating
","I found the film increasingly predictable and tedious as it went along, but it was still worth a watch in a noire/surreal sort of way, just to see what sort of stunts the director would pull off, but these comments are posted just to let you know that John Wick isn't half as good as it should or could have been.<br/><br/>The film didn't quite work. It didn't have enough tongue-in-cheek ridiculousness in it to classify it in the same breath as Kill Bill, and there wasn't enough technical believability to make it into a valid Matrix clone.<br/><br/>The film seemed to be centred around Wick (Neo) being the 'one' and having some sort of super power that made him bigger/better/faster than everyone else, but whereas I could believe that in other films, I couldn't believe it here. All he did was brood! Keanu Reeves didn't even look the part, nor tough enough, nor capable of half the things he did.<br/><br/>It was too far-fetched to be enjoyable, and even though credit goes out to the director for knowing the film was too far-fetched and playing to those strengths, but it wasn't original, cheeky or tongue-in-check enough to make it shine as anything other than an average and unrealistic Rambo/Commando type of action flick. Even the Russian gangsters were corny and clichÃ©d.<br/><br/>We've seen it all before, and if you want to make a ridiculous film like this work then you have to approach it in a completely OTT manner like Kick-Ass! Here they kicked Russian butt and kicked it some more, and it was ridiculous, and please remind me why John Wick even did it? Something to do with a puppy from his dead wife being killed and having interrupted the grieving process.<br/><br/>In the end it mildly insulted my intelligence in a Fast-and-the-Furious sort of way, but I'm still giving it 6/10 for its valiant attempt."
"carter-47153","8","2","6","24 August 2015"," Keanu's Comeback
","Keanu Reeves. It is a name closely associated with career defining roles and missed opportunities. He has had some of the top fan favorite roles and cultural icons over the last twenty five years. From Neo (The Matrix Trilogy), to Ted (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure), John Constantine (Constantine) to Jack Traven (Speed). He has been a part of science fiction remakes (The Day the Earth Stood Still), Expiramental Animation (A Scanner Darkly) and Horror (Bram Stoker's Dracula).<br/><br/>Mr. Reeves has shown an acting range from the dramatic, comedy and physical action. Though he has had a tremendous career his characters have tended to flat and a little unbelievable.<br/><br/>Sure he proved in Speed that he could be an ""action star"", in The Watcher that he could be creepy and could handle lead acting duties in a franchise with The Matrices though his roles had become diminished over the last five years. Though his performances have never been bad, the expectations that surround him have always been out of reach. Then came John Wick.<br/><br/>As of late, Mr. Reeves has begun a comeback of sorts. The phrase ""of sorts"" is used as his comeback is not finished yet. It started with Man of Tai Chi and 47 Ronin and has continued into John Wick. It has the feel of a role that is perfect for Mr. Reeves' acting abilities. John Wick is a character who is dark and brooding. The character is not put into a position where he would express happiness. He is angry, sad, and on the verge of grief throughout the film. Mr. Reeves' ability to perform choreographed action scenes is put on display here. These range from intense fighting scenes to wonderfully choreographed shootouts to elaborate set pieces that border extravagant but don't cross the line.<br/><br/>Several times throughout the film the fight scenes are set up in a manner that allow Mr. Reeves to perform in a flawless manner. This is done by letting the camera roll. As opposed to the standard practice constant cuts during filming and letting the editors piece together a fight scene, the director of John Wick keeps the camera rolling and allows the audience to experience John Wick's physical struggle and exhaustion. These are not simple fight scenes either. In a couple of instances the actors are having to perform dozens of physical moves while the camera demands perfection. Mr. Reeves not only succeeds at this but also helps to show the believability that he is capable of in the right circumstances.<br/><br/>One can only hope that this movie will continue to place Mr. Reeves in strong roles that he is more than capable of continuing to play. It is a definite treat to see Mr. Reeves at his best again."
"disappear-932-509120","5","2","6","15 August 2015"," Mastery on one hand, utter confusion on the other.
","Has all the makings of a decent mediocre action flick, but is utterly and completely ruined by the crippled/fake Russian and some bad dialogue choices. The style of subtitles however, suggests it can still be enjoyed as a gritty-goofy comedy, since the dramatic element is hard to maintain in this state. With such level of detail offered to stunts and choreography (which is to be expected in a film made by two stunt coordinators) it's even more frustrating to see (or rather hear) that all the dialect department's work has been futile (or non existent at times). I guess 15 years into XXI century, it is still too much to ask Hollywood to consider showing their foreign lines to an expert and/or dubbing them at least if native speaking actors are not an option. (It doesn't even have to be an expert, really). Of course, all of this in John Wick poses no threat to those unaffected by understanding of Russian."

Most movies are neither horrible nor excellent.<br/><br/>Then along comes John Wick, pretty much from the first second I just liked it. The atmosphere is great. Keany Reeves is great. It's crisp, it doesn't waste your time. Normally a movie might start real good, then dip down. Or a movie starts badly, then gets better. John Wick starts excellent, and it just doesn't let up. Every scene is good. <br/><br/>I love animals. (I don't even eat them! :P ) And if you love animals, this movie is such a treat. Man oh man.

OK, maybe not that many, but a crap-load for sure.<br/><br/>It is violent. The action direction is superb. <br/><br/>But one of the best things about it, which makes it so damn efficient, is that the build-up is so darn awesome. They do all the right things to get you to understand what kind of ultra bad-ass John Wick is. It is so expertly done, by the actors, the reactions, the direction.<br/><br/>I've seen naysayers complain about the lack of ""originality"" or whatever in John Wick, and I'm just sick to freaking death of hearing that. If you want originality, do something else than watch movies, because originality has nothing to do with whether a movie is great or not. <br/><br/>If the movie is well made and entertaining, it is good.

Certainly one he is starring in.

While Denzel is clearly the better actor, this evens everything up with a choreography that really gives you everything it got. Gunkata is a term you might have heard a couple of years ago. It's here again and it's no wonder that the two directors have a good relationship with Keanu (since working with him before a couple of times).<br/><br/>Great ""guest"" appearances and really good cinematography. This looks great and it has a lot of violence in it. If you're down with that, go ahead and watch and prepare yourself for the inevitable sequel/prequel or whatever comes our way"
"misterwatts2013","3","2","6","2 June 2015"," Well made but is this film healthy for its audience?
","This film is well made, no doubt about it. And my reasoning for a low score has everything to do with the subject matter of the anti-hero, the obvious mkultra programing that has been incorporated into the sound design and the message of the theme song which is played more than 3 times through depictions of murder. The lyrics whale, ""we don't kill the ones we love."" Then suggest's we kill strangers. <br/><br/>The extremely violent well choreographed scenes of gun play look like a masterful ballet of bullets and blood. Which made me really wanted to like this movie and I commend the filmmakers for their skill set. <br/><br/>However I guarantee future ""shootings"" and random acts of violence will source this as material of encouragement.<br/><br/>The story subtly suggests that the anti-hero is not one to idolize but quickly is countered in its sound design.<br/><br/>Truly questionable material. I would not recommend for children or teens or anyone easily influenced by manipulation."

It looked like it might be fun to watch, but I had no idea how much I was going to like it...this was easily one of the most epic collections of choreographed violent episodes I have seen. Being a dog lover, and an owner of a beagle since she was a little puppy, that only made it all that much better to watch someone exact the most out of proportion vengeance for the loss of a dog.

Would have been better if they gave it some kind of crazy twist like Kill Bill then it might have been in the running. I guess that is the producers fault for lacking a bit of insight to see that a whole bunch of killing can become a bit mundane if there is not a good enough twist added to the movie.

The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, produced by Basil Iwanyk, David Leitch, Eva Longoria, Michael Witherill, written by Derek Kolstad, and starring Keanu Reeves. The movie is about a hitman's return to the criminal world after a tragedy befalls him.<br/><br/>John Wick is a great action movie. The movie has many excellent action set pieces that are incredibly well choreographed and produced. The movie uses Keanu Reeves incredibly well in the lead role of John Wick. Keanu Reeves is able to portray the tough man and quick stylish action that the movie's direction requires. The movie has awesome scenes that are awe-inspiring to watch. It makes for a thrilling experience simply sitting through the 101 minutes of running time.<br/><br/>Surprisingly for an action movie, John Wick has a compelling world. John Wick introduces the world of assassins to the audience and it is one of the most interesting worlds. Although there are many cliches that are used in this movie, the overall world seems interesting with its own culture, customs, and hierarchy. These customs come into full view about midway through the movie. It makes for an interesting when the movie uses these customs to dispatch of the villains.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are well-acted and are interesting. This movie gives character to every important player in the movie. This is surprising from an action movie. Of note is that John Wick is already a well known player in the world that had retired. Many of the characters that talk to John are already scared of his reputation. This results in dialogue that is unique to action movies where the characters already have a pre-existing relationship with the main character.<br/><br/>I highly recommend 'John Wick'. This movie will please action junkies and it will also appease audiences looking for an interesting world.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","John Wick is my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movie as it has everything that he is best at, spectacular stunts and actually great acting. With Chad Stahelski directing the movie it couldn't have been bad choreography or action sequences as that's the background he came from and it shows in the incredible choreography and action sequences that mixes martial arts and gun fu which is a blast to watch. Derek Kolstad wrote the movie and it isn't really that original script but it works perfectly for the action genre but where his writing shines is the world he built, from the assassin network to the characters, simply amazing.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is my other favorite thing about the movie, having Keanu Reeves as the main character is never wrong, having Michael Nyqvist and Alfie Allen as the villains was perfect as they portrayed the villain roles perfect and Michael shined the most of the two, stunning performance. There is a lot of other interesting characters that are played by Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe isn't either wrong. Simple to say it's a fantastic cast with A list actors.<br/><br/>This movie is personally one of my favorite action movies of all time, it has everything an action movie should have and much more.

","The movie came in with perfect intentions for John Wick to do the needed damage. I was very excited for his reign but this ""boogeyman killer"", ""Shadow-man"" looked a little rusty. Maybe because of his retirement?
I did root for John Wick all the way through but when the bad guys clearly have more than one chance to easily kill him and they DON'T but instead decide to throw him around it makes me feel a little awkward.
Some shallow choreography in the shoot outs. It seems John Wick is the only one that can shoot straight, EXCEPT, that is, when he has his first clear shot at his main target. Haha!
Also seems he's the only hitman who can see his opponents first- more especially when he's walking from room to room & wall to wall shooting them like targets.
Also the arbitrary ""rules"" of a ""code"" between all the community of hitmen/women was up in the air and disconnected from any of the stories momentum.
In an action movie all these details make a huge difference on the pay off.
All this production needs is a good script and better choreography."

"theterminator-92378","7","1","2","23 February 2019"," Fun, Action Packed and violent
","John Wick with a basic look at action movies looks like a regular action movie but when you watch it you can tell that it's more than your basic action movie it has moments where it's character driven and you really get a sense on why the chracters act the way that they do and we really see this emphasised with John as we feel his pain and we understand his character and we know and care about him and we can devote time and effort into caring about him
Keanu Reeves is the perfect cating choice for this movie he can kick so much ass and i have to say that i can't think of anyone to play this role he just does so much and puts in effort and care for thre character and i love how he can go from someone who seems soft especially all the stuff with the characters wife and then become the scary hitman who could kill you in 5 seconds and that is quite some acting and i could honestly talk about great Keanu Reeves is in this role for so long that he goes for me from being a actor who i thought was good to being one that i want to see more movies with him in them.
also in the cast is Michael Nyqvist,Alfie Allen,Willem Dafoe,Adrianne Palicki,Dean Winters,Daniel Bernhardt,Toby Leonard Moore,Bridget Moynahan and Lance Reddick while the supporting cast was good they really are over shadowed to Keanu Reeves and they are good i just don't think they were the most dynamic cast and had a rushed time on screen but really they could have been used a little more.
John wick for me was good there was some pacing issues for me in some of the parts where i thought they were trying to pan the run time but that's really what i thought and i really liked this the final act was one of my favorite final acts in a action movie from recent years and the action scences involving the gunplay was great and the hand to hand combat was also very well done they have done it in such a way where i can really belive that the action was real and overall the movie delivered on the action violence and the drama all in one and i thought that overall John Wick was very enjoyable and defiently a action must watch."

The other main characters are also quite believable in their respective roles. 10/10 for characterization.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the action sequences (basically the whole movie) was extremely well choreographed and fun to watch. However, the way Wick kills literally dozens of attackers without being seriously injured himself strains credulity and really bugs me. 4/10 for believability.<br/><br/>However, I allow that this movie was not meant to be taken too seriously but to be enjoyed at face value, so I will average the two and give it a 7."

The tempo along with the captivating photography works like a drug. The choice and use of color in this movie was probably what immersed me in it the most.<br/><br/>There is this heartbreaking scene at the beginning that was hard for me to watch. As opposed to a horror flick, it was very real and traumatic. Tears welled up in my eyes. <br/><br/>I only advise you to watch this one if you are aware of and thus not vulnerable to this problem of desensitization.<br/><br/>I could have rated this higher and said the same thing but I feel that film makers (directors, writers and producers are all included) abuse their expertise and initiatives too much to boost the influence they have over their audience, selfishly denying any responsibility they should be having for others by opting to exploit their vulnerabilities such as the need to have good time, as there is little free time, or the need for instant gratification. <br/><br/>As delicious and harmful as a snack dipped in all the wrong things for a healthy body."

","Having seen the second film first from Redbox I was hesitant to turn back with this action film. John starts the film as a beat up and depressed ""white privilege."" Like it says, he is coming out of retirement. As a retiree, he is sitting pretty. He had a home decorator come in and his house looks like a womans home. He has those decorative pillows from Pier 1 and some Candles. He lost his wife/gf. So he's depressed. Clearly he misses his woman. He gets a puppy to cheer himself up. John doesn't really understand dogs. He feeds the dog a bowl of cereal. Then he gets knocked out by a bunch of thugs (in the dark in his house) and they off his dog. He is a damn fool for not locking his doors considering he is an assassin. Alarm system? Strangely, his fighting skills disappear during this time. Also it is clear he is not a light sleeper. Out for revenge, John Wick digs up his old suitcase of assassin guns. He broke his oath of weapon chastity. Obviously he should of known his career would never be over when people hate his guts. Considering his weapons, he has a variety of sizes. He usually likes the big black ones. I've also seen him put an extender on the handheld. He doesn't like the fully automatic because he wants to move it himself. He oils them up and cocks them for good measuring. I can tell he's a pro after I watched the Matrix. Then he goes and kicks ass for a 1 minute fight seen. After that he goes to that Hotel from the second movie. I got bored with the repetitive rhetoric and couldn't watch the rest. FOUR STARS"
"MrDHWong","8","1","2","2 August 2017"," Does for Keanu Reeves what Taken and Harry Brown did for Liam Neeson and Michael Caine, respectively
","John Wick is a 2014 action thriller directed by Chad Stahelski and David Leitch. Starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, the film successfully revitalises Keanu Reeves' career and brings him back into the spotlight as an action hero.<br/><br/>In New York City, retired assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves), mourns the death of his wife Helen to a terminal illness. Shortly after, John receives a puppy as per request of Helen to help him come to terms with her passing. One night, a trio of Russian gangsters break into John's home, beat him up badly, kill the puppy, and steal his car, after John refused to sell the car to their leader Iosef (Alfie Allen) earlier that day. Now with nothing left to lose, John vows revenge on the gangsters and comes out of retirement to settle the score once and for all.<br/><br/>With a good amount of action, drama, and some cleverly choreographed shoot-outs, John Wick does for Keanu Reeves what Taken and Harry Brown did for Liam Neeson and Michael Caine, respectively. The filmmakers do a good job showcasing why the John Wick character is so feared, yet respected within the crime underworld of New York thanks mainly to Keanu Reeves' nuanced performance as the ""one man army"" title character. Often times, I feel that Reeves' approach to his acting is very hit-and-miss, however here, it is most certainly a hit. The film's creative use of colour and lighting gives an almost anime and noir feel. There were many times where I could tell the directors must have watched several anime and kung fu films to serve as inspiration for the overall tone.<br/><br/>I rate it 7.5/10"

Allie Allen was pretty good as Iosef Tarsarov. Both the villains were very poor and they could have been infinitely better. Willem Dufoe was decent as Marcus but he didn't get enough screen time. The other cast members were reasonable.<br/><br/>A basic and simple movie which was perfect. Nice and warm ending.

","The first 10 minutes of the movie are somehow misleading.

It is a pop movie made to please the audience in a tongue-in-chick manner. You enter the world of mobsters and payed assassins where everyone is known, everyone goes to the same place for entertainment, follows rules and is slick and understanding! Like ...Cheers, where everybody knows your name! So this isn't a movie to be taken seriously. It's just for fun. And after numerous killings, lame martial arts moves and macho one liners... you get exactly that.<br/><br/>All the clichés you know well from thousands other movies are here too. The villain (so to speak because everyone is a villain) instead of killing his captured victim right away and solve all of his problems in an instant, starts blubbering philosophical BS and chooses an unconventional way to kill him (instead of let's say a bullet in the head).<br/><br/>So is that kind of the movie.<br/><br/>Is it entertaining? Well yes. I think so. I wasn't bored for the most part. I learn quickly to ignore the plot holes and just tried to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Overall: It's a popcorn movie, so go get your popcorn! P.S.

The good woman dies, but has a dog sent to Reeves as a remembrance. Actually I can sort of understand that. I recently acquired a cat from someone who was close to me and died unexpectedly. If I had Keanu's killing skills I might do what he does.<br/><br/>But definitely this was a role that cried for Rambo as Keanu plows through the Russian mob. The son of the mob leader tries to rip off Keanu's car and beats him up in the process and kills the dog. That last remembrance of his wife puts him over the edge and then look out Russians.<br/><br/>I did find it hard to wrap my mind around the concept of an organized crime safe house where Reeves takes up residence while he does his thing. <br/><br/>An interesting part is played by Adrianne Palicki as a female hit woman who wants to show up the men in the profession by taking down the guy who was number one.

"Leofwine_draca","8","2","7","25 September 2015"," Action as it should be
","JOHN WICK is a rare example of Hollywood getting things spot-on when it comes to creating the near-perfect action film. JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.<br/><br/>JOHN WICK isn't a perfect film; some of the dialogue is sloppily, some of the writing is too broad, and occasionally the music is intrusive. However, when it gets things right, as it frequently does, you can forgive all of these minor niggles and sit back and enjoy the ride. The clever decision was made to employ a martial arts expert as director, so the emphasis is on realistic, superbly choreographed action sequences, and they're hard-hitting and plentiful. The nightclub set-piece is the obvious highlight, but nearly all of the action here is spectacular.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves has been in lots of average or overrated films over the years but this stands as one of his very best, alongside SPEED. His dry, laconic turn is light years ahead of his other recent action flick, MAN OF TAI CHI. The supporting cast is basically unnecessary, but Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, and Alfie Allen all put in decent turns. In the end, though, JOHN WICK is all about the action, and quite simply it rocks. Bring on the sequel!"

","It's been a long while since we've received a balls out action movie that works on every level. Luckily for us, filmmakers Chad Stahelski and David Leitch have concocted one hell of a brutal, fun, and highly entertaining action film, starring the man, the myth, the legend Keanu Reeves. If you've been bored with your action movie choices as of lately, don't worry, 'John Wick' is the ultimate action flick of the year. Sure, it's a story that you've seen many times before, and I'm sure you'll see many times after this one, but 'John Wick' is filmed so well, has great performances, and is as brutal as you would hope in a gut wrenching action film, that you'll leave the theater fully satisfied and wanting a 'John Wick' franchise.<br/><br/>I know I did. Life is not good for John Wick (Keanu Reeves), a retired hit-man for the Russian mafia who has gone straight, and is leading a normal quiet life with his beautiful wife. Unfortunately, John's wife tragically dies and is left all alone with his new puppy to help him through this tough time. A few days after his wife's funeral, some criminals break into his house, steal his car, and make John's life go from bad to worse. Not knowing who John is, these criminals are in for some severe consequences as the head Russian puts it, ""John Wick isn't the boogeyman, he's the guy you send to kill the boogeyman.""<br/><br/>From here, Wick is on a path of destruction as he goes through bad guy after bad guy to kill the people who stole his car and took away the thing that meant most to him. And man, Wick is unrelenting as he is a skilled martial artist and professional gun handler. He can take out any person or obstacle that gets in his way. And the directors do a perfect job of not cutting every three seconds so that we can get a long good glimpse at the excellent fight choreography so we can see the scenes play out and the stuntmen and actors perform their skills.<br/><br/>On top of that, it's a lot of fun with some great lines of dialogue that will muster up some laughs throughout. 'John Wick' isn't a silly film by any means though. It's raw, tough, and has some of the best shot action scenes in a very long time. You'll feel every hit, shot, and kick full on, leaving you glad you weren't there in person to get a swift kick to the face.<br/><br/>This movie pulls out all of the stops and is one of the most entertaining action films of recent memory and Keanu Reeves as always is a badass and great on film."

","Wickedly action-pack entertainment is what ""John Wick"" brings! The movie instantly wicky wakey'd me up with its no-holds barred bravado tone. Kudos to Director Chad Stahelski for his masterful action orchestration of the picture. ""John Wick"" stars a sensational Keanu Reeves (yes, you heard right!) as the title character. Wick is a former Russian mafia hit-man who seeks all-out vengeance on his former boss' son for stealing his car and killing his puppy beagle. Hey, I am a beagle owner myself, so I can empathize with Wick, I would go bezerk if someone hurt my beagle. Wick is pretty much a badass one-man army in seeking his revenge as he battles an entire Russian Mafia Army! Sure, it goes over-the-top at times, but who cares? The action sequences is the paramount of the picture. Keanu Reeves has never been better, I don't know what kind of red or blue acting pills he took to prepare for this, but it worked. The always great Willem Dafoe also delivers a hit performance as a former accomplice of Wick. And Michael Nyqvist delivers a good performance as the baddie head Russian mafia honcho Viggo Tarasov.

","If you're asking me if John Wick is entertaining, the answer would be a resounding ""yes"". The action is fantastic throughout most of the film, the gunplay is some of the best in modern cinema, and the unique elements of the film make for a combination of intrigue and strange humor that make the fairly short movie a joy to watch. If you're asking me if John Wick is a good quality movie, the answer is more of a ""meh, not really... but it's not bad."" The acting is almost non-existent (seemingly by design to fit Keanu Reeves' style), the plot is about as generic as they come, and the ending is laughable. During the first 90% of the film, they made an effort to be as realistic as possible. That end sequence almost erased all of it. It was still an entertaining movie but I was hoping for more."

","John Wick accomplishes everything that it sets out to. It is an action film at the very core, and does not muddy the waters with the addition of pointless subplots or heavy, complicated storytelling.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple; revenge. That's really all you need to know to be able to appreciate this film. If they edited out the first ten minutes of exposition, it would not take away from the remainder.<br/><br/>Some people, when reviewing John Wick, are comparing it to all the wrong films. This is not an epic drama or high fantasy set in a wondrous world. John Wick is simple, down to earth, action movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography is outstanding. You can really tell that each shot has been framed exactly. The acting, admittedly, could have been better. Keanu Reeves appears to be playing Keanu Reeves. But that's what he does best, and that's what the character of John Wick requires. As a side note, Willem Dafoe puts in a solid supporting performance.<br/><br/>Now the action is something that I have not seen in an action movie for a very long time, and it had me exhilarated. John Wick has about him an air of cool, calm professionalism whenever he is 'working'. This makes the moments when he comes unravelled and boils over that much more compelling. Suspension of disbelief is required when you actually watch John Wick fighting, but this is something that you will do eagerly; the fights are extremely well choreographed and very fluid. There are very few neck-breakingly quick cuts that are now all too popular in action scenes.<br/><br/>The gun play is awesome to watch. John Wick very rarely misses a shot, and he doesn't leave the big bads alive to come back and get him (the only time he does leave an enemy alive is due to rules outside of his control, and killing would leave him in a worse position than leaving her alive). He is ruthless and efficient.<br/><br/>In summary, do not judge John Wick by any other standards than those which it claims to uphold. As an action film, it has exceeded."

","Keanu Reeves has not been in the lead role of an amazing action film for some time. In fact I would go as far back as 1999's 'The Matrix', not including its silly sequels. That film showed audiences and critics alike that there was still freshness and room for expansion regarding the science fiction genre. Likewise, 'John Wick' has the same effect on the action genre. The last film truly off of the rails and full of excitement was 1988's 'Die Hard'. Yes, 'John Wick' is that awesome.<br/><br/>John Wick is an ex-hit-man. He is overcome with grief when his wife dies from a fatal illness. Knowing that she has little time left, she leaves John a gift to remind him of her. A dog, Daisy. Within the next few days they form a close bond. Alas, it is not to be. Masked Russian gangsters break into his house, killing his dog and stealing his car. It is time for John Wick to take his revenge.<br/><br/>If 'John Wick' sounds like the next 'Taken' film or average revenge tale, then you are mistaken. This film has style, energetic and frenetic fights as well as an actual plot. Think of it like 'Kill Bill' with Keanu Reeves replacing Uma Thurman in the title role. John Wick may not be as outrageous as the work of Quentin Tarantino. But it is far more daring and fun than the recent batch of action films from Hollywood's generic production line. This is what makes John Wick stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves in the starring role gives John Wick solemnity, thus lending him realism as opposed to Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills from 'Taken' who was stapled with clichés. We buy Reeves' character because he is a broken man with nothing left, as a result we can sympathise with him. Iosef the leader of the Russians who break into John Wick's house is played by an egotistical Alfie Allen, he makes the mistake of triggering John Wick's unstoppable anger. Iosef loses his cool real quick when he realises the gravity of what he has done. Enter his father, played by the sinister Michael Nyqvist, who shows little compassion and love for his son. Iosef strives to please him, leading to some very foolish decisions. Iosef does not think about the consequences of his actions, until it is too late and John Wick comes a calling. Willem Dafoe is never less than magnificent. His role makes an impression, he is John's trustworthy ally and gives him a purpose, when no one else in the world will.<br/><br/>What is primarily involved in 'John Wick' and the centre of the audience's interest is the fight scenes. They take place in a variety of everyday locations. A house, nightclub, hotel, secret safe house and even briefly a church. Do not fear. Shaky cam is barely present. You will actually be able to tell who is punching who. This was clear in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and anything but in the 'Taken' Trilogy. The action is not a rehash of the film's previous set pieces and each one is unique and wholly original in its approach. Take for example the scene in John Wick's house. The camera is locked down with wide angles. We can take in each punch, kick, stab and bullet wound with ease. 'John Wick' makes you feel alive. The set piece in the nightclub differs in style. As John Wick runs towards Iosef, the camera sways from the left to the right. It may prove disorientating to some viewers, yet you can always establish what is going on and who the enemy is. It does not prove distracting or poorly framed. I felt reborn and could revel in each detail to my heart's content.<br/><br/>Most action films feel obligated to make it past the two hour mark. Not 'John Wick'. All the fat is trimmed off, so that only the meat and core of the film remains intact. Therefore, you are not left waiting too long for the next set piece. I do have one minor criticism of 'John Wick'. So minor in fact, that it is barely worth mentioning. The very first scene feels redundant, when you look back on the film. However, it does not hurt the film and only the most picky audience member will take issue with it.<br/><br/>The score by Tyler Bates and Joel L. Richard compliments John Wick's uber cool clothing and look. It is in touch with the film and increases the mood and tension to a considerable degree. Undoubtedly, without this elegant score, the film would not be half as charming as it is.<br/><br/>The cinematography is polished and sophisticated. The action takes place within the frame. This means you can stay focused without feeling ill. You only have to look at the most recent 'Taken' outing to see how poorly this can be executed.<br/><br/>'John Wick' is a top tier action film. Filled with layered characters, confident performances, a suave score, radiant cinematography and free flowing fist fights. This is the best film of its kind since 'Die Hard' and miles ahead of 'Taken' in every aspect. If 'John Wick' does not become a franchise, then generic action flicks be warned, I am going to take my revenge upon you."

","Keanu Reeves is back with a vengeance. A real vengeance. John Wick is easy to follow; Wick (Reeves), having lost his wife and attended her funeral, is taking the time to mourn the one he loved. An unexpected delivery in the form of a new pet jolts him out of misery, that is until a mob of Russians break into his house, kill his dog and steal his car. They have unleashed the monster in him; he tears through New York city leaving a rather large body count in his wake. First time directors Staheski and Leitch makes John Wick an incredibly powerful film. They're known in the industry for their stunt coordination skills, so it's only right that they're at the helm. Keanu Reeves' martial arts is replaced with raw grappling and gritty kills. The action is smooth, energetic and dynamic. Reeves is ideal as the wounded hit-man, saying little and expressing emotion through his brawling. The Russian gangsters and their boss play a familiar tune. Viggo (Nyqvist) knows his son's crossed the wrong person. Humour accompanies his importance as a leader, adding value to the film's atmosphere. Topping that is the film's rich, dark blue hues in every shot, giving us a tease of NY City's underground scene. I mean, who wouldn't want to check in to a hotel where all the other hit men stay? John Wick is stylish, sophisticated and compact. A sequel is already in the works.<br/><br/>Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk"

He stars as the typical action hero / anti-hero and unlike all the usual crap talk about how hard the main character is in all of Tom Cruise's films this one actually measures up. Its not stop action all the way and there isn't any stupid CGI to take over the screen or unbelievable action sequences that defy the laws of physics or gravity which is a major bonus in my book.

","Since i was born because of the influence of my father and grandfather, action movies have always played an important role in my knowledge for films. As many reviewers have said before at first glance the title John Wick for a film seemed ridiculous, therefore whenever the movie trailer came out as an advertisement on youtube i would straight away skip it. I did watch the trailer once and thought it was terrible, to me it made no sense at all. However one day i decided to watch it clearly because i had nothing else to watch or do at that time, and so my review begins. The last good and by good i mean really good action film i saw was Lone survivor but for me that a different category not really action. John Wick on the other hand is pure 100% action, no Expendables type of action no Fast and Furious type of action not even James Bond type of action, THIS is something else. First of all it clearly shows how well Keanu Reeves trained for this film i don't know if it was Kravmaga or something else but it was incredible well done and looked very realistic. Second of all the story is just very cool, i like the fact of how the hotel runs with important rules etc.. and Russian mafia i mean that makes it cool too. And just to finish the thriller part plays well in the story and how the actors act. Great movie for anyone who loves and knows how to appreciate a good action films."

","This movie totally kicked ass. From the wonderful characters to the amazing action scenes. The soundtrack was on point. It drew the viewer into the movie. The hallmark of a good actor is to make you forget the actor and believe the character they are playing. Keanu IS John Wick. Yes the plot was predictable and a little over the top. WHO CARES! The plot was simple but the pacing and action scenes more than make up for the simplicity of the plot. You rooted for John Wick's character. I could imagine all dog lovers saying ""Kill em' All!"" After the bad guys killed the most adorable puppy ever. The only thing that could have maybe helped believe John's motivation for destroying everyone was if more time between him and the dog was spent together bonding. But despite this...the movie was never boring. I never once thought ""this movie is stupid"" or rolled my eyes at the ridiculous of it like I have at other movies like Expendable 3. You wanted John to come out on top. The action was exciting. It did try to be more than it was. It was an action movie. So great full that they didn't make this movie in stupid pg ratings. That is why many of the other action movies suck. People getting there heads chopped off but there is no blood..stupid. this movie held nothing back. It did not waste time on sappy love stories, sex was not overly displayed. Great characters, again one of the best action movies for the year. I hate I missed seeing it in a theater."
"MackMonMay87","7","2","7","15 February 2015"," Simple, Yet Effective; If Well Shot Action is What You Like, John Wick Delivers
","John Wick is a simple action story with elements that we've all seen before, and nothing about it is groundbreaking or particularly intriguing in terms of the story or performances, so if you cannot value an action film for its set pieces, choreography, and stunt work, then this film isn't for you. <br/><br/>For action fans, I would definitely recommend it, the camera work is still yet dynamic, and allows us to see a great view of the action while not obscuring anything that happens. All of the action scenes are quick, to the point, brutal, and have consequences for all characters involved. John Wick isn't presented as invincible, just highly skilled and lucky. His character has been out of the assassination game for over 5 years, and that makes Keanu Reeves playing the part a bit more of an easier pill to swallow. Although I might want to bite my own tongue here, because for a man nearing 50, he carried out every scene to the letter and in my opinion was more tough and convincing than he ever was in any of The Matrix films here. <br/><br/>I saw influence from another great 00's action flick, The Man from Nowhere, which if you haven't seen but enjoyed this, I would highly recommend. <br/><br/>John Wick has a lot of style, the locations are spectacular, I often found myself asking ""Where did they find this place?"" Gorgeous Victorian and old school architecture to high tech modernized homes, you really feel that you've covered a lot of ground watching this. Another element of the style is the world it takes place in. It's a very stylized, slick graphic novel type alternate reality, where coded language, an honor code amongst assassins, and even secret resources and hotels for them is all the norm. <br/><br/>The film doesn't treat any of this as strange and takes you along into this bizarre world, revealing more and more at a time, while including things such as John Wick running out of ammo multiple times to keep it refreshingly grounded. <br/><br/>Again, in terms of writing, story, or acting, this isn't a critic's dream. I saw this with a friend on a lazy Saturday morning after having some Waffle House, I feel that is exactly how this movie is meant to be enjoyed. <br/><br/>As an added note, as a martial artist myself, I appreciated the use of Judo and Jiu-Jitsu on film, most movie fight scenes are 90% striking based and are afraid to show ground and grapple work. Good on them for not being shy of it. <br/><br/>John Wick gets a 7 out of 10 for slick, well choreographed action and a quirky, dark humour sheen, complete with a high body count."

","American cinema has been continually producing very bland and forgettable action movies (The Equalizer serves as a recent example— does anyone even remember that movie?). This year's earlier martial arts showcase, The Raid 2, easily beats out everything else from the genre's crop, and that is especially including the Marvel/superhero movies that are more about spectacular set pieces than innovative, fascinating action choreography. Well, maybe the American Kung-Fu fan/renowned action star is the best chance we have at an effective American action film at this point. <br/><br/>""People keep asking if I'm back; yeah, I'm thinking I'm back!"" Keanu Reeves returns to staple badassery as John Wick who has recently lost his wife to cancer. After the painful funeral, he unexpectedly receives a delivery package at his door—a final gift from his wife in order to help ease his grief: a cute, little dog. Of course, trouble never ceases to find Wick and after unintentionally pissing off a group of Russian mobsters at a gas station, they give him an unpleasant visit where he witnesses the murder of his dog and suffers a brutal beating. Oh, it's on! Little do those guys know who they're messing with—a bogeyman who has even spooked the mob boss into beating some sense into his culprit son and letting him know what exactly he has done. John Wick—with his deadly skills teased and his true background mysterious— readies his weapons, and pure ruthless revenge ensues from there on out. <br/><br/>The movie accomplishes just what American action cinema fails at every time. The action sequences are filmed with the use of astonishing cinematography—plenty of wide shots to perfectly display everything that transpires on-screen without confusing the audience. The camera invariably gives us a good layout of the particular environment, which is followed by John Wick's clever utilization of those surroundings to break bones and rupture skulls. In fact, the film is so embellished with glitzy style that even its subtitles come all vibrantly colored with a catchy font and ingenious screen placement. <br/><br/>The majority of the film is set at nighttime, and thus, we get that metropolitan vibe along with a dusky color palette—an alluring greenish/bluish hue. In addition, a groovy, cool soundtrack incessantly complements the impressive action sequences; the best segment taking place in a violet-lit, intensely-staged night club as guns blaze and dubstep drowns out the screams. And despite Keanu Reeve's transparently limited acting range, this tough-as-nails role certainly plays to his strengths with the intimidating monotone one-liner delivery and that never-ending, rigid look of sheer ire. <br/><br/>Unlike The Raid 2 however, there's no compelling narrative to give the film's duration any necessity to continue. John Wick simply comprises one action scene after another. Unfortunately, the combat gets repetitive fairly quickly—repeating wrestling techniques (choke holds, etc.) and blowing brains out with the same up-close strategy—and it honestly feels like the plot struggles with where to proceed next. ""Oh, I need to kill this guy, and now I have to kill this other guy in another location."" The story essentially follows this formula and hopes that the viewers find that adequate enough for non-stop entertainment. An hour in though, it clearly begins to drag and doesn't show any sort of storytelling restraint in terms of when enough is enough, which is the same issue The Equalizer shared. <br/><br/>If this high-octane extravaganza was only slimmed down by thirty minutes, it would've made for a far more satisfying and memorable experience, but I just can't say that John Wick even compares to the consistent mastery The Raid 2 boasted. This one has its fair share of cheesy, awkward moments (albeit with intention) but also just overall shallowness. With that being said, beholding the first hour alone makes it worth seeing over every American action movie this year (I still don't know if that says a lot about the staleness of the genre nowadays, or if I should just accept that John Wick surely possesses stunning quality?)."

","I don't know how deeply I want to get into this. It's like stepping into a septic tank.<br/><br/>So let's keep it short. Keanu Reeves is John Wick, wearing a cloak of ordinariness. Some Russian miscreants insult him at a gas station. That night, they break into his house, beat hell out of him, steal his car, and kill his dog. Well! The beating, yes; the car maybe; but the dog -- NO! His response is first-order change. He knows who dunnit because he just retired from a Special Ops group and he's skilled at martial arts, the use of deadly weapons, and has a talent with macramé. None of these guys with a hidden past ever turns out to have been a busboy or a plumber. <br/><br/>Similarly, the bad guys, as here, tend to be either Germans, Russians, or Arabs. We've never quite forgiven the Germans for World War II. Russia was balanced on the fence but now with Putin in charge, a dictator manqué, they seem to be fair game again. I'm certain that in the crepuscular recesses of Hollywood board rooms they are DYING to drag Muslims into the narratives but it wouldn't be PC now, would it? The plot? Oh, the plot. John Wick shoulders his way through a crowded night club where the Russkies hang out and shoots everyone who looks disagreeable. His gun is quick. And he's thorough. One ugly adversary gets three bullets in the abdominal cavity and one in the center of the forehead. The wounded lying on the floor, he shoots and kills more or less in passing, not really paying much attention to them. That's just the first brutal encounter. Several others follow.<br/><br/>In between massacres there are a few minutes of metaphysical discourse. ""John, what happened? You and I were colleagues."" ""Yes, but bonds fade with time."" ""Surely some symbolic interactionism persists."" ""Well -- YES AND NO."" ""At least as the systemic level!"" ""But not as individual traits."" ""But how can you KNOW that?"" ""My epistemological intuition."" (Bang, shoots interlocutor in center of forehead, dead center on the saggital suture.) By the end, Wick has either killed or brought about the death of dozens of men and women. Willem DaFoe dies horribly, for reasons never explained. It was just time for another bloody killing, I guess.<br/><br/>Someone else suggested that this was a perfect action movie because it had nothing much other than perfect action. And if you don't like action movies, then stay away from them. I suppose I don't like most action movies -- the Stallones, the Schwarzeneggers, the van Damms, although I have a few on DVDs if they have something going for them besides blood -- if the narrative is properly jelled (""The Bourne Identity"") or if its so silly it's amusing (""The Terminator"") -- but ""John Wick"" takes itself seriously, as if it were structured in a way that distinguishes it from one of those skin flick with just enough of a thin plot to link the sexual episodes, the genre that begins with a happily married couple, then drags in a new lover for each, then the chauffeur, then the mule, and so on. Yet, the perceptive viewer is able to discern a moral message beneath the mayhem. Leave dogs alone.<br/><br/>Why go on? John Wick, Chapter 2, is already in theaters."

Hardly any dialogue or emotion, the perfect Hit-man just doing what he needs to do until the job is done. I thought the action scenes were very well done with the shoot out scenes done amazingly. Yes the story isn't the best in the world and some of the acting is very over the top and unbelievable, and the ending could have been a little better, but with a film like this, sometimes it's just nice to forget all the little flaws like that and just enjoy the film for what it is.

","First of all, I really like Keanu. <br/><br/>I don't want to waste too many words on the film itself: should be more than enough that it was directed by a former stunt coordinator. Or check the ""stunning list"" of works of writer Derek Kolstad and you will understand immediately. <br/><br/>The reason to write this post is about IMDb scoring system and so many reviews beginning with: ""I went to see this movie because of the IMDb scores, but..."" The companies, who are investing 10-30-... million dollars in a film quickly realised that if the reception on IMDb is weak, than their expected turnover falls. How simple it is to influence that? You need a PC and few hundred fake identities and the masses follow quickly. After few years the statistical majority of real viewers will determine the final verdict. That's all. <br/><br/>It is really sad that we lost (again) an independent and non-influenced opinion sharing possibility, but we have to live with it - and forget IMDb as a reliable source (at least in the first year) of a Hollywood released movie.

","Keanu Reeves, is a problem. A really big problem. All of the characters that he plays, turn out to be Neo (The guy who saved us all from the machines in 'The Matrix'). They all even have the same face!!<br/><br/>But seriously, the guy is perfect for a lot of the roles that he has won (The Matrix, Point Break, Speed), its just that its wearing a little thin now. One thing is for sure, other than a Razzie, Reeves wont ever be picking up an award. <br/><br/>This film sees Reeves playing the titular part of 'John Wick'. We meet him just after he has lost his wife. Not in a shopping mall, or out on the beach silly....she has died very recently. There is something of a mystery around 'Wicks' history, who he is, what he does, where has he come from...but all those questions get answered throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film asks little of Reeves. The action is blisteringly fast, and some of it is genuinely.....'Cool'. The gun fights and hand to hand combat are handled with a visual panache that I haven't seen in a few years. Chad Stahelski and his team certainly have a firm grasp of how a 'fight' should be conducted. The great thing about having an action film starring Keanu Reeves, is that with all the action taking place, there leaves little room for Reeves to talk. He really says only a hand full of words in this film. <br/><br/>Dog lovers be ware, there is a scene on par with Mad Max 2. You have been warned, and you will end up hating Alfie Allen even more than you do watching Game Of Thrones. <br/><br/>A classic, by no means, but this is the kind of film that you can disappear into, watch, and never think about again. I don't think I will ever watch it again, it was a perfect 'Throw away' film. <br/><br/>A good waste of 2 hours on a Sunday night."

","Keanu Reaves after a long time. It is always good to see him. Normal acting, OK direction but the script/story was not digested. The film comes with an old approach action based plot. <br/><br/>And you always know when someone gets out there to take revenge what happens. Some good Jiu Jitsu moves and close combat gun shots can be seen. Max Payne flashed through my mind while watching the film. <br/><br/>It was broken in between in many ways where you will just say does it really happen or why and how did this happen.<br/><br/>I would say its just an average film and you can watch it for once and enjoy the action."
"santiagocosme","3","3","16","24 January 2015"," Same old rubbish.
","I recently wrote a review for ""Equalizer"". In that review I complained about encountering the same old clichés over and over again in action movies. Clichés that you will find in John Wick: a mysterious protagonist who has lost his wife in unknown circumstances to the viewer, the bad guys who always happen to be Russians and/or speak with a funny accent, and obviously, the protagonist being capable of taking on an army of killers as if they were Playmobile figurines. No need to say, that even though he finds himself in the most stressful situations, he's always calm enough to use sarcasm when he speaks, have perfect hair after every battle, and even have a few ladies fall in love in the process. And all the troubles and the hundreds of killings (yes Keanu Reeves kills more people in an hour that in the Matrix trilogy) over a stolen car and the killing of a puppy! I jest! <br/><br/>Anyway, enough with my own dose of sarcasm. There's only three words to describe this stereotypical action-packed-I-have-seen-it-all-before-movie: boring, boring, boring. But I guess that since it still manages a surprisingly high 7.3 rating, my opinion is only shared by a few. So watch it at your own peril, and whether you like it or not, tell me if anything I say here is untrue!"

","The first 10-15 mins is the story build-up and after that, 90 mins of continuous action. The dialogues were impactful with extremely well choreographed action sequences. The camera work was praise worthy and especially they didn't used the shaky camera technique which actually spoils an action sequence. It's a noir/action-thriller genre so the themes are dark.

The one thing I did like despite all the stereotypes and mediocre acting, was the Continental Hotel. It's there for hitmen only (and for an equal number of pretty hit women). Off the grid of Law enforcement parties of course who were almost completely absent the whole time.
Consider this a comedy rather than an action movie. When you are looking for action or a thrill, I suggest to skip this movie and book a room in the Continental Hotel. Obey the house rules though or you may get killed with a pencil."

"ChristianLeFeuvre","10","1","3","1 May 2019"," Keanu Reeves' best role and best performance
","Keanu Reeves is John Wick, an ex-hitman who, on the day of his wife's funeral receives a puppy as a final token of love from his wife. When thugs break into his home, kill the puppy and steal his beloved and rare Ford Mustang, he sets out for revenge which leads him on a path that brings him back to his former lifestyle and pits him against the Russian mob.
'John Wick' is not only a terrific action movie but in my opinion, is definitely Keanu Reeves' best role and best performance.
The movie is directed by long-standing stuntmen Chad Stahelski and David Leitch and the stunts in it are seriously impressive and Keanu Reeves performs the majority of his own stunts himself, which is really good to see. They have made a slick looking movie with not only some incredible action scenes but some really good dialogue scenes too.
Michael Nyqvist plays the main villain, and head of the Russian mob, Viggo Taraso, and Alfie Allen is Iosef, Taraso's arrogant and foolish son who was the leader of the thugs behind the attack on Wick's home.
All the acting in this film is superb and as I said, this is easily Keanu Reeves' best movie since 'The Matrix' and definitely his best performance. Not just for the action scenes, but there are some fantastic emotional scenes too that involve a great deal of anger and despair and Reeves is seriously incredible in all of these too.
This is such a good movie because it's not just a revenge action shoot-em-up movie, there is so much more, there's actually a lot of interesting character developments, you learn a lot about this underworld of criminals.
The action in this movie is almost unrelenting once it's starts, amazing shoot-out sequences, intense hand to hand combat sequences and what makes it more enjoyable, more believable is that you can see it's actually Reeves doing all this, it's not a stuntman, and this is what Keanu Reeves is good at, he knows how a good action movie should be. He famously did his own stunt work in both 'Speed' and the majority of stunts in all three of 'The Matrix' movies.
'John Wick' is a non-stop action movie which has a smart script, a terrific hero, great villains and some heart-pounding action scenes. It's great to see a movie made by directors who understand the action genre so well and who have made a slick, appealing movie with an amazing cast.
But as I said, this isn't just an action movie, it's so much more and the dialogue scenes are just as intense as the fight scenes.
If there were any faults in the movie, I'm finding it hard to think of any. The final scene of the movie seemed a little sloppy and forced, but that's it, really, I couldn't find fault. This is an action movie that knows what it is and a lead actor who knows how to immerse himself in a role."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","1","3","8 March 2019"," A revolutionary new way to do an action film.
","I'll be honest and say that I initially thought this film was just another action movie. Of all the action movies that come out these days, there wasn't much that intrigued me enough to spend the time with this particular one. However, after some of my friends were raving about it and I saw a few YouTube videos describing why it was so great, I decided to give John Wick (2014) a chance. To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. This film was not just another action movie. In fact, it was quite exemplary in its breaking of traditional action movie tropes.<br/><br/>The most noticeable difference this movie has compared to other action films is its camerawork. Ever since The Bourne Identity (2001) changed the action movie genre, the cameras have been quite shaky, and the action is, therefore (increasingly) hard to follow. Not so with John Wick. The smooth and steady camera shows off the incredible talent of its titular main character as he performs a highly choreographed ""dance of death,"" killing all who might confront him or impede his progress toward his vengeful goal. Surprisingly enough, because everything happens so quickly, the violence is almost toned down despite the enormous body count.<br/><br/>Additionally, I liked the character of John Wick (portrayed by Keanu Reeves). Not only is he calm, cool, and calculating, but the universe in which he lives shudders at the mention of his name. The whole ""infrastructure"" put in place to support Wick was just as fascinating and entertaining as the stories people would tell of his previous professional exploits. And while the premise for John Wick leaving retirement was flimsy at best, it drove home the point that you should never, ever cross this character.<br/><br/>A revolutionary new way to do an action film, I give John Wick 4.0 stars out of 5."

"sco-32745","3","1","3","15 February 2018"," watch Oldboy (2003) instead
","I have seen john wick twice, once before watching Oldboy, and once after.
On my first viewing, I loved the film. The scenes at the start which kick-start the plot were so unexpected and shocking that I immediately wanted John Wick to go out and kill many, many people.
The film was not plot heavy, but it wasn't really about the plot, it was about the action scenes, and the action scenes were beautiful. The styling of the action scenes, were it pulls away and creates a dynamic movement, that's elegant and precise, and isn't cut to shit, so you can actually see what's going on, was amazing to me at the time. The nightclub scene alone is one of the most incredible pieces of action cinema that I had scene. The action styling was perfect, it didn't reduce impact and cut away for a PG-13 rating, and the way in which it dimmed the sounds of the violence and turned up the music made it seem almost like a dance. and the world building, I was fascinated by this world, the golden coins and the hotel and all of the little intricacies laced into the movies were incredible. In short, I loved this film first time around.
Then I watched Park Chan Wook's Oldboy.
Oldboy is a masterpiece.
Watch it.
On my second viewing of John Wick I was viciously let down. 
After the first fifteen minutes in which the events that kick-start the plot take place, the plot ends. That's it. After that john wick kills people, for an hour and a half. Even the world building that enchanted me so much the first time around fell flat, on a second viewing it just seemed rushed, and only existed so that john could kill somebody else, it was a means to an end, and that showed. 
John Wick, people could argue, isn't about the plot, it's about creating a clean stylish action flick, with stylized, yet unflinching and realistic violence. But to those people I say: have you watched Oldboy. Everything that makes the violence in john wick so good, came from Oldboy, the dulling of the impact, not clear and precise, but thick and realistic, comes from Oldboy. The long action takes, the gorgeous action choreography, all from Oldboy. 
The other thing that Oldboy has that John Wick doesn't, is plot. Now, the clean stylish action flick is fine by me, but if it's as unoriginal as john wick, and everything in it has been done many times better, in a movie that didn't sacrifice plot for violence, and delivered masterfully on both, just don't bother, watch Oldboy. It has a plot, and fight scenes cooler than the ones in John Wick, where enemies don't feel the need to come one at a time so John can pick them off."

Whatever style was attempted for this film failed miserably. The hotel? John Wick could have taken out the murderer of his dog and thief of his car very early in the film when he eyed him in the bath. He shoots everyone in sight except his target?

","I just saw this movie today, roughly three years after release, and can't believe that it took me so long to watch this. The reviews don't do it justice. And as others have said, on paper, the premise doesn't look that interesting, which might also be why I overlooked this. This is a revenge action flick, and the only thing I can think of to explain the lower reviews, is that some people just don't like revenge action movies in general.<br/><br/>The story isn't very complex, which is typical of revenge action. Typically, I prefer a little complexity. Pure action, like Transformers and Max Max Road Fury usually isn't my thing. However, while the story is simple, there is just enough of a story to separate this movie from the two I just mentioned. Some people say the action in this movie is non stop. But I disagree. There are small breaks, just when you need them to explain the films universe, and its characters. Another thing that separates this movie from pure action films like Mad Max Road Fury, is that there is an actual clearly established goal, and you are given a very strong reason to actually care about the protagonist and his desire to accomplish it. Not to mention, an unusually strong reason to really really hate its antagonist(s).<br/><br/>As for the acting, I was very impressed by its lead hero played by Keanu Reeves. He's stepped up his game from previous films. He can really sell the emotion of sadness this time, which was critical in this movie. If he acted the way he did in The Matrix, this whole movie would not have worked for me."

A totally excessive and brutal retaliation in which dozens die, together with the perpetrator and his father. <br/><br/>But then again, on a second thought maybe it's not good to break completely free of this family premise after all... so let's make the puppy be a present from the recently deceased wife. Oh, but maybe the puppy is not enough? Let's have the expensive sports car of the protagonist be also stolen!<br/><br/>There there! Now we're creative, novel, traditional, and have insured that a large audience can clearly empathize with our Keanu Protagonist and cheer at the death of the bad people who did all these horrible things.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Besides this lack of a reason for it's existence, the revenge is well executed, thus 6 stars."

"dromasca","6","1","3","31 March 2017"," aesthetic and violent
","As John Wick: Chapter 2 is on screens and gets unexpected good reviews and not only from fans, I thought that it's a good opportunity to see the first and original John Wick which also received some positive echos, much above what is typically delivered for a film in its genre. It's certainly a matter of setting expectations, but I personally was not disappointed. If violent action movies are one of the genres that entertain you, good chances that you will not be disappointed either.<br/><br/>Rule #1 to enjoy such a film is to accept the conventions of the genre. The story takes place in the parallel universe of the crime underworld. Although bodies start to accumulate in piles pretty soon, there is no policeman in view with the exception of one cop showing up at one point, looking at the scene of the carnage and wishing good evening to the hero who happens to be a professional killer. This parallel universe is not lawless, it's just that the laws or better said the rules are different. There is a code of honor, there are territories of neutrality, and there is only one punishment - death - for breaking rules or trespassing borders. At the roots of the story stands a failed tentative by the main hero to break the cycle of violence of his profession and jump in the universe of normal people. All this is just memories when the action starts. This film is for Keanu Reeves what 'Jack Reacher' is for Tom Cruise and I suspect that at some point even taking the name of the hero as a title is not a coincidence. It's the start of a series and the second installment was not too late to come.<br/><br/>Assuming you bought into the story and the convention, there is some good stuff to enjoy. Stuntman Chad Stahelski is sitting for the first time on the film director chair and he delivers exactly what is expected - a coherent story telling and perfect choreography of the many action scenes that occupy more than half of the duration of the movie. Keanu Reeves delivers what is expected, and a few other fine actors show up in small and even smaller supporting roles. Cinematography is just beautiful, with combinations of dark colors that fit well the violent dark universe that they populate. If you can just forget how sketchy the whole story (or pretext) of the film is, you have good reasons to enjoy it."

","You must let the 'suspension of disbelief' prevail when you watch John Wick. You'll enjoy it more by not going in with expectations of realism. It's nearly a super (anti)hero movie.<br/><br/>I have two complaints. The spark that ignites John Wick on his killing rampage could have been better. The interconnections of the mafia thugs accidentally meeting him at the gas station was just too coincidental and random to work well. Also, I wasn't sure what all the burn-outs in the Mustang was about. Maybe it was filmed for a sequence that was never completed. Maybe the director needed some filler. Maybe Keanu just wanted to spin the tyres of an awesome muscle car.<br/><br/>Besides those niggles, I loved the stylized violence, very tight direction, and the sheer number of deaths packed tightly in a fast moving, easy to follow plot. A perfect movie to watch when downing several beers.<br/><br/>This film is the very definition of a violent, action movie, a bit like those I remember from my youth.

","Another typical adrenaline-fuelled 'revenge flick': lowlife angers unstoppable killing machine, carnage follows, secondary subplot develops, further carnage, lowlife dies, secondary subplots resolved by additional carnage, semi-redemptive ending with unstated promise of a sequel – need I say more. The movie would have benefited from little more focus on the 'underworld' motif and a few less exploding SUVs and generic Russian-mafia corpses-in-waiting. If you like this kind of thing in general, you'll really like the movie (hence the relatively high IMDb score); if you don't, you likely won't make it past the first death. I fall somewhere in between: I like these kind of movies when there is some substance underlying the style. Unfortunately, there is nothing to 'John Wick' beyond endless photogenic but interchangeable fight scenes."
"peefyn","7","1","3","30 July 2016"," A great action movie
","This is a great action movie. The premise is as simple as it is effective: John Wick loses everything, and goes on a revenge spree. The reason why it works so well, is that the characters and the setting are both very interesting, and the action scenes are very good.<br/><br/>The movie is set in an almost comic book like world, where there's a community of hit men and people in the underworld, with their own set of morals and code. They all use certain businesses (or services), which ties them all together. It's this universe that makes me curious for sequels to John Wick. The characters in this universe are mostly quite fun, and a lot of that owes to great casting. The way they gradually reveal John Wick's past is interesting, and it leaves you wanting to know more about who he once was.<br/><br/>But, despite all the good things about the movie, it never elevates above its genre."

","Without being able to claim to be a particular fan of Keanu Reeves, then I had very little expectations to ""John Wick"" prior to sitting down and watching it. I knew it was in the action thriller genre, and that was about it.<br/><br/>And now that I have seen it, I must honestly admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this movie. I was more than entertained by the storyline, and the sheer volume of action sequences in the movie is more than sufficient to keep any action fan more than happy. I will actually go as far as to saying that this is actually among the more enjoyable and entertaining of movies that I have seen starring Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>The storyline, in all its simplicity, is about a retired gun-for-hire, John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves), who just lost his beloved wife. And as a small puppy shows up at this doorstep, as a last gift from his departed wife, John finds some reason to continue on in his grief and his downtrodden world. However, when a group of Russian thugs steal his car and kills his puppy, they have no idea who they are messing with, nor the magnitude of his skills and capabilities.<br/><br/>While the story is fairly simple, it is tremendously entertaining, and the added spice of all the action sequences really help lift up the movie to a very enjoyable level. The action sequences are really well executed and equally well filmed.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" is not a movie that requires any thinking from the audience, so you just simply sit back and enjoy the action.<br/><br/>I am rating ""John Wick"" a solid seven out of ten stars. And it was good to see a movie of this scale from Keanu Reeves. If you enjoy action movies, then ""John Wick"" is highly recommendable."
"npdeo18","7","1","3","20 June 2016"," An entertaining action film
","John Wick is the kind of action movies which will remind the action films fans of the movies in late 80s and early 90s. The action scenes were paced well and entertaining. Also this movie must have definitely given relief to Keanu Reeves as he delivered a hit after long time especially after the disastrous 47 Ronin. I felt that Michael Nyqvist as the main antagonist was cool and at the same time menacing along with other secondary villains. Another best part of the movie was that this film was not dragged like other action films in recent times. <br/><br/>I am definitely waiting for the sequel which is releasing in 2017 and would hope it would develop into a better franchise. <br/><br/>John Wick is one such movie that should be seen without any logic and would prove to be entertaining on any weekend."

Once the set-up has been staged - Wick grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable actioner.<br/><br/>Wick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz strange, though) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern blockers. And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions.

The writing is well done and allows the viewer to follow the story while being invested in the characters. It could have been just another mindless action flick, but the actors and the dialogue give it some depth to make it a film worth watching more than once. <br/><br/>John Wick (Keanu Reeves), a retired legend in the assassin world, mourns for his dead wife. Her last gift to him is a puppy and a note telling him to love and find peace. It doesn't take long for Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) to mess up John's path to these things. In response, Wick delves back into the criminal world he left behind to seek retribution for Iosef's actions. <br/><br/>The story weaves Wick's past life into his present life and reconnects him with old faces including: the female assassin Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki), friend (Willem Dafoe), and former employer Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He faces the difficult task of breaking Viggo's organization to get to the man who took his mourning period away from him, Viggo's son.<br/><br/>Put this on, sit back, and expect a film that delivers for the expectations of: action, a simple but tight story, and an enjoyable time."

","Keanu Reeves plays the Liam Neeson role in this slick, sharp, vicious little bout of revenge fantasy. With support work from a whole mess of ""I know that guys"" and a blow-away effects budget, it's a real riot to watch, not to mention one hell of a tech demo for the masterminds behind the fight scenes. Like those Neeson kill-em-alls, though, it's as straight as an arrow and shallower than the kiddie pool. In some ways, it's refreshing to just dispense with all the stereotypical origin trappings and get right into the firefights, but at the end of the show it just feels like one long, easy excuse to watch a whole mess of cool stuff without any extra justification. Lust-worthy cars, ferocious weaponry, powerful western-styled physicality, stereo-thumping tunes, magnificent cityscapes, the list just goes on and on. Escapists delight, for John Wick has come to deliver a dream. Cinephiles, well just sit back and try to let the sheer, celebratory brutality beat your conscience into submission.

"jtindahouse","8","1","3","9 June 2015"," More style than substance but still a lot of fun
","It feels like a very long time that Keanu Reeves has been out of the game for. The last film of his I believe I saw before 'John Wick' was 'The Matrix Revolutions"" way back in 2003. He's had films in between now and then of course but I suppose none of them have really caught my fancy or been highly praised enough to warrant a view. Then out of nowhere, along comes 'John Wick' that everyone is raving about and saying Reeves is back. I was delighted. In fact I'm disappointed with myself that I've taken this long to see it. Nevertheless it was worth the wait.<br/><br/>The film isn't really what I expected. First of all the kill count was astronomically higher than I ever would have expected. Secondly the style caught me quite off guard. Hit-man characters are always cool, there's no way around that, but Wick was another level on from that. The scene with the policeman showing up at the door and being entirely comfortable with the fact that there was a dead body lying on the floor over WIck's shoulder was absolutely perfect and set the tone for the rest of the film brilliantly. This was no ordinary assassin (if there is such a thing). <br/><br/>Reeves performance was good. The role was suited to him in the sense that he didn't have a tremendous amount of dialogue and he could get by with the odd one-liner here and there to carry things through. Say what you want about the man's acting abilities, but he portrays cool like few others can. <br/><br/>I read that this is intended to carry on into a trilogy, so it will be interesting to see where they go from here. I think a lot of what made this so enjoyable for so many people was probably the same feeling I got of witnessing something you hadn't expected. Obviously that effect will not be available to them in the sequels and I feel like they will struggle to up the body count, so what exactly it is they'll do to keep it fresh I'm not sure. However they choose to go about it though I'll be happy to see another outing from Wick."

","Aahhh, it took me a while to watch this movie, because it looks like just another bad action flick, the poster is not helping either. I love films, from foreign, docs,festival to the Hollywood blockbusters of all genres. I hunt for certain directors, and I do love intellectual films or some might call them art flicks. But the genre that I do miss is the action trash ( grind house films ) In the glory days of VHS, many films were released only for the VHS market. Many of those are the simple, dirty action films, some are bad and some are so bad it's great. Well..John Wick reminds me of that. No BS, revenge films.If you are aware of the Charles Bronson's Death wish, John wick has a similar idea. Recently I am very happy with what Liam Neeson does ( Taken 1,2 and A walk among tombstone )John wick has similar feel .

","Directed by Chad Stahelski, ""John Wick"" stars Keanu Reeves as John Wick, a retired hit-man. When his wife dies, and his cute puppy is killed, Wick embarks upon a quest for revenge. Standing in his way is Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), a local gangster with hundreds of men at his disposal.<br/><br/>""John Wick's"" a love-letter to over 70 years of action movies. Its oldest ancestor is Fritz Lang's ""The Big Heat"", a 1953 film in which a vengeful cop takes down the mob bosses responsible for car-bombing his wife. ""Wick's"" other blatant influences include John Boorman's ""Point Blank"", Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns, John Woo's Hong Kong action flicks, the crime dramas of Jean-Pierre Melville, ""Yojimbo"", ""Payback"" (1999) and the tough-guy films of Charles Bronson (""Mr. Majestyk"" in particular). Where ""Wick"" differs from these films is in its slick action sequences. This is unsurprising; Stahelski has long been a stunt coordinator.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" has been compared to Gareth Evans' ""Raid"" movies. But unlike Evans' work, ""Wick"" has a sense of humour, it knows it's ridiculous, and its well-honed comicbook dialogue manages to be simultaneously funny and portentous. Indeed, the film spends 30 minutes hyping up the superhuman dangers of John Wick, who subsequently unleashes himself upon every mobster in the film like a lava-spewing Mount Vesuvius. <br/><br/>More interesting, though, is the world Stahelski has created. Like ""Alice in Wonderland"" with machine guns, this is a dream world which seems to exist 2 inches below contemporary reality. Willem Dafoe co-stars.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Worth one viewing."

The cast, lead by the ever underrated Keanu Reeves, is exceptional, and really help to lift the material to another level.<br/><br/>'John Wick' may not be art, but it doesn't aspire to be.

This is an action film and there's plenty of it. Think 80s action films but with more gore and intensity. It all looks pretty too. <br/><br/>This is supposed to be a fun movie. I get it. But it would've been nice to see more realistic gun fights that showed John Wick's using his entire repertoire of skills to take out dozens of armed gunmen instead of just showing his incredible quickness and ridiculous gun shooting accuracy. <br/><br/>I'm not sure how this film got rated above a 7. The film looks pretty but the script is awful and the characters are uninteresting. If you want to watch an action film that's been recently released and are similar to this I suggest watching either Shooter or Olympus Has Fallen. These films are just as violent but are more interesting to watch."

It even went all ""direct to VHS"" with scenes that left you thinking things like ""the guy you want dead the most happens to be right in front of you, you spent half the movie trying to kill that guy, and then for no apparent reason you just don't do it, just to try to kill him again once he is safety away from you...just WHY?"", or the classic ""bad foreign guys talking English when they are alone""...all the things that make us laugh when watching B-movies. Problem? The lead role is friggin Mr. Keanu Reeves! I mean, Keanu, my man, what's wrong with you? Did you already spent all that Matrix money? And you did some good stuff before and after so tell us, why did you find the need of making this movie? How could this topical typical unwanted and definitely not needed movie help your career? Man, I even liked Devil's advocate but this? This is murder man.<br/><br/>So Mr. Reeves, I sincerely hope whatever financial problems you might be in, whatever favor you needed to do, whatever contractual requirements you had to fulfill, are now over and you can go back to do proper movies.<br/><br/>As for whoever wants to watch this...just don't waste your time.<br/><br/>Finally, if you want to ask why I did not give it the lowest mark the answer is that I like the golden coins thing.

Mr Reeves fits the role well, he's the sad, loner type with hidden depths who is seething beneath that unreadable exterior. What I found hard to swallow was the seemingly vast assortment of similar characters and the almost comedic stereotyped mobsters who are so incompetent. There are ways to make this type of action realistic and more believable (Jason Bourne trilogy) but this film just relies on clichés to carry it along. It's one man against an incompetent mob and from the minute you see it start to get going, you know the outcome, all very predictable for most people which left me feeling a little bored. Cinematography is good, it's stylish in a simple sort of way but what little dialogue there is could easily have been omitted and you would have no problem following the simple plot.

Keanu's super tough character John Wick struggling to take down a girl who looks more like she should be selling perfume than she would be capable of fighting and killing? Sorry, this is not remotely believable.<br/><br/>John Wick getting caught and needing to be saved time and again throughout the film? How amateurish. Watch the Bourne trilogy instead. Bourne never made the mistake of letting anyone know where he was, which is why he was always a step ahead of his pursuers. If he ever got picked up he'd planned it in advance so as to attain information. By contrast John Wick continually blundered into situations that would have seen his end in an even half way real world.<br/><br/>But the fight scenes were original and awesome. Oh yeah, and regarding Keanu's acting being terrible, which is what I've read from others here on the discussion board and in reviews: he cries when he reads his wife's letter and he makes it look more believable than most actors I've seen dealing with similar emotional scenes. His acting was great.<br/><br/>So, will you walk away from this film considering it a masterpiece?

The directors are fans of action flicks and they know what makes them tick in the mind of an audience member which is why there's about 10 smile-inducing beats a second. They're not here to get a quick buck, they want to make the right type of action-fuelled neo-noir.<br/><br/>It's neither too generic or too outlandish, too swift or too laborious. It just totally works. Some nice beats exist, the fact that the father of the son knows he's an idiot, or two actors ripped from The Wire make an appearance, or a hitman hotel (something that is a such an simple and effective idea it's a wonder that it hasn't been done before). And Nykvist makes for a charismatic non-shouty bad guy which is refreshing.<br/><br/>Like John Wick himself, the movie is relentless, sharp, brisk, terse, thoughtful and creative. If they made a thousand of these I would be a happy man to find out how they creatively diversified each time."

Every character has something to offer to the story, and the action sequences are filmed in a natural and realistic style.

These criminals come from a gang which he worked with 4 years previous. Everyone in this gang appears to know who he is, except for the 4 guys that raided his home - how convenient?<br/><br/>The problems with the plot are as follows:<br/><br/>Super assassin has no home security?
Super assassin goes down stairs in the middle of the night following his dog that woke him up and does not consider the dog may have heard something?
Super assassin can shoot people through walls without having to see where they are (happens later in the film), but can't tell there are 4 guys in his own house
Super assassin does not even attempt to block blows from guys in his house beating him up, but exhibits super martial arts skills later in the film<br/><br/>Im not done yet<br/><br/>Super assassin can do head shot after head shot for minutes on end, then misses multiple times when aiming at key characters whose death would have ended the film prematurely. This happens twice, once when the son in running from the pool and again when the father is in the car<br/><br/>The way the director plays with John Wick's abilities, now he is god, now he is mortal, now god again, depending on which fits his forced plot ruined the film for me"
"Dan1863Sickles","2","1","4","4 June 2018"," I Am Overwhelmed By The Accumulated Dumbness
","The three dumbest things in the world are Keanu Reeves, action movies, and music videos. So now, here's an action movie starring Keanu Reeves that's shot like a music video. I am overwhelmed by the accumulated dumbness. <br/><br/>Imagine PAYBACK with Mel Gibson, only without the wit, guts, human suffering, and wisdom. And Mel's been replaced by Tab Hunter, Frankie Avalon, or someone like that. <br/><br/>Imagine THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, only without the romance, elegance, tension, and simmering sexual heat. There's no Mira Sorvino here, and Chow Yun Fat has been replaced by Beavis and Butthead.<br/><br/>All through this movie, there are moments that are laugh out loud stupid, where the film makers clearly expect the viewers to fall into a worshipful stupor and start jacking their bones. Wow, look how fast that car is going! Man, that is a sharp looking car! I am getting so hot now, just looking at that car! And the music is so LOUD, man. LOUD MUSIC MAKES ME SO HOT! And now guys are getting killed! Man, I love to see guys getting killed. LOUD MUSIC CARS GUITARS GUNSHOTS OH MY GOD I'm COMING RIGHT NOW!!!! <br/><br/>And of course, Our Hero must look ""cool"" at all times. He can't just take his guns out of the closet. No, he has to take a SLEDGE HAMMER and SMASH the floor to dig out his old guns! So cool!!! And when the bad guys are coming, he has to put on a sharp, three-piece suit, with cuff links, so he can fist fight and pistol his way around. I mean, a ripped t-shirt and jeans might be better, yes? To move fast and have quick reflexes? But no, it's so much COOLER to watch him put on a suit and tie. <br/><br/>With all that going on, take some time to notice the sadness on the faces of all these veteran actors. There's that old black guy from THE WIRE -- he looks almost grateful to be getting killed after five minutes. There's Willem Defoe -- he still hasn't forgiven himself for making all those Spider Man movies. <br/><br/>Oh, but it's not just aging has-beens who are being humiliated here. Who's that good looking young chap running through the crowded disco in a towel? Can it be . . . can it be . . . it's Alfie ""THEON GREJOY"" Allen. Did you see him running through the crowd, looking like a goofball? No? Let's slow it down! How many minutes of Alfie running in a towel do we need to see? But it's okay, he's got tons of music blasting away. And it's LOUD!<br/><br/>I really wanted Keanu to ask Alfie, ""did you pay the IRON PRICE for that car you stole?"" And then Alfie's last words could have been, ""what is dead may never die!"""
"dierregi","5","1","4","6 August 2017"," A parallel criminal world packed full of clichés
","Not being a fan of action movies I watched this on TV, out of a mild liking for Keanu Reeves. I know he has a reputation as a bad actor, but at least he never tries anything he cannot handle.<br/><br/>Reeves is John Wick, a super-assassin living in what I gather (or hope) is a parallel world. Wick ""retired"" to live with his wife but she died and left him a puppy as a goodbye gift.<br/><br/>The premise of the ""retired professional' is one of the stalest in the movie world, such as the killer with a heart and we get both in this movie. Wick gets out of retirement to avenge the killing of his dog and the theft of his car. Obviously, it is no regular villain who angered him, but the reckless son of a Russian mega-mobster.<br/><br/>Moving from his designer villa to the city of New York, Wick gets to stay in a luxury hotel called the Continental, where criminals must refrain from ""conducting business"" or else being ""excommunicated"" from the great criminal brotherhood.<br/><br/>Wick's criminal pals are sympathetic about Wick's loss and also scared of him, because of his fierce reputation. Knowing that ""honor among thieves"" and criminal luxury world are bulls**t, helps rooting for Wick's revenge. It also helps that the villains are Russian mobsters and everybody knows the world can do without them.<br/><br/>As in every action movie, one also knows that the hero is next to indestructible and that some preposterous fighting scenes will pave the way to a car chase sequence (or vice-versa). As long as you keep your expectations low, Wick will deliver. Reeves is predictably laconic and the world his character inhabits is suitably menacing and dark, a sort of lawless Gotham city.<br/><br/>PS I did not see this threadbare plot as an opening for sequels, there being very little original material to carve out more stories, but unfortunately it happened... and it just went downhill."

","In this 100 minute long action sequence, the action is relentless. There's action, action, some more action, and then just for good measure, an added dose of action. Fans of the action genre will love it, especially since they don't have to concern themselves with any sort of plot.<br/><br/>Seriously though, 'John Wick' is so blatantly action-oriented that any intentions of coming up with a plot and sticking to it go completely out of the window within the first 20 minutes or so. The film gets so carried away with itself that any story that it was supposed to be telling is soon forgotten about.<br/><br/>If this is what the action genre has been reduced to, then why not just make a generic, special effect show reel instead of pretending that there's some sort of interesting plot behind what's happening on screen, when there blatantly isn't?"

","If you like action, maybe you can bare this for the full duration of the film...<br/><br/>I have personal preferences for Keanu Reeves's acting. He is quite talented actor, and I believe he did some really good titles. The problem he has in this film is the scenario I guess. There is not much part from ""go kill some poor fellows"". He all of sudden (obviously, there was a trigger for this) he went from a pensioner to killing spray machine... similar to the Matrix.<br/><br/>Obviously he sometimes got wounds... otherwise it would have been a lower rate from me, no matter how fond I am to him (since the time he played Neo the chosen one in the Matrix).<br/><br/>In a sum - my rating is a bit higher than it should, if you like action, shooting and blood - you may like it. There is a story but it is not yet developed - hope they would be better in chapter two.

","""John Wick"" (Keanu Reeves) is a highly regarded hit man for the Russian mob who has gotten married and retired. Sadly, five years later his wife dies and he is overcome with grief. Anticipating the impact her death will have upon him, his wife makes one last secret arraignment and has a little puppy sent to him a few days after her funeral as a parting gift. Realizing the love behind the gift he immediately becomes attached it. However, one morning while walking down the stairs of his home he is hit on the head by a thug named ""Iosef Tarasov"" (Alfie Allen) and before losing consciousness watches as it is killed in front of him. Afterward, Iosef and two other hoodlums then steal his mint '69 Mustang and leave. That afternoon these same thugs take it to a body shop to sell but the owner recognizes who it belongs to and refuses to have anything to do with them. As it turns out, Iosef is the son of a Russian mob boss by the name of ""Viggo Tarasov"" (Michael Nyqvist) who becomes terribly upset at Iosef for what he has done and desperately attempts to make amends with John. Unfortunately, John refuses to talk and this results in Viggo sending a dozen men to kill him at his home. But John is waiting for them and none of them come back alive. And now it's his turn. At any rate, rather than reveal any more I will just say that I really enjoyed this particular movie and it kept me entertained from start to finish. I especially liked the performance of Keanu Reeves who essentially owned the role and provided a dominating presence throughout. In short, I thought this was a really good film and I have rated it accordingly."

","The Three Acts:<br/><br/>The initial tableau: In modern day greater New York/New Jersey, John Wick's wife Helen suddenly dies of a long lingering illness. His old acquaintance Marcus gives his condolences after the burial. He grieves for an interval. In the days after the wake, a puppy, Daisy, is delivered with a note from Helen. John and Daisy get to like each other. While out with Daisy getting gasoline, two Russian mobsters stop for gas at the same time. Iosef admires John's Mustang, and offers to buy either the car or the dog or both. John declines, and an older associate calls Iosef off. Iosef and two friends break into John's house, beat him up, ruin beautiful things, shoot Daisy, steal the Mustang, badly damage his newer car, and steal the bracelet of Helen's that John kept near him.<br/><br/>Delineation of conflicts: Daisy was John's last living link with Helen. The necklace had similar importance. John wants vengeance on Iosef and on Viggo. Aurelio informs Viggo of Iosef's actions. Viggo understands the problem that Iosef has created. ""That f*ckin' nobody is John Wick."" he informs Iosef the idiot. He advises Iosef to get out of his sight. He asks his associate, Avi, to task all his available men to take on John. When that fails, he sets a bounty of 2 million USD on John's head, and also asks Marcus to do the job as soon as possible. Will Viggo live through this? <br/><br/>Resolution: The many conflicts were resolved in what I thought were reasonable ways. I recommend this film to anyone who likes the genre.<br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>There are some great music tracks in this film, and the incidental music was well chosen. The actors were well miked, and I had no problems picking up dialog.<br/><br/>For a revenge movie, this had a fine script. The direction and the plot lines certainly raised my hopes that John would succeed in everything that he tried. Plus, the end of Iosef is something I looked forward to from very early on. I seldom get that engaged with revenge films. I loved the humour between old pairs of friends while there were lulls in the action."

","A friend of mine had see this movie and told me to go and watch it. I asked him what it's all about. He simply said that it's about a ex-bad ass coming out of his retirement to kill other bad asses. Of course I wasn't that interested because this kind of plot has been done to death. Over the time I heard a lot about this movie and decided to watch it, and boy, this is truly one of the best action movies of the year.<br/><br/>Keanu Reaves has done most of the stunts himself which has given the movie its realism. No action scene in the movie looks artificial, even the gun shooting scenes had a certain realism to it as you can see them reloading their guns at proper intervals.<br/><br/>All in all this is an entertaining movie and specially a treat for the lovers of this genre and fans of Keanu Reeves. Don't expect many twists or shocking moments from the story as it is quite simple, but it doesn't matter because even if they have kept the plot simple, they have executed it to perfection.<br/><br/>In the movie, there is scene where a character says, ""John Wick is man of focus, commitment and sheer will."" After watching the movie, I couldn't agree more. Enjoy :)"

","So many people who complain about him not waking up middle of the night after having retired thinking someone might be robbing him.. Even if he's a bad-ass, people cannot simply wake up when it is time to kill. It would demand that you have low IQ if you think you're above humanity when being a retired hit-man even with unlimited skills.<br/><br/>At first i wrote a bad review (1/10) of this movie because of this assassin girl who is spared after trying to kill him as he is sleeping and severely wounded. but he still decides to spare her for no other reasons then he must want her to kill him or anyone else?? or obviously in Hollywood they love wasting quality for some women audience which i don't think they got because of that anyways. but yeah it's a BIG hole in the movie cause there is no way in hell someone as john wick would not have her killed..........<br/><br/>The script to this film gave me cancer for a moment, but honestly it's a great action movie.

It's non stop action from beginning to end, and who cares if it doesn't make sense, if you can turn everything off and just relax and watch the carnage then you WILL enjoy John Wick."
"rjm-geo","9","1","4","21 March 2016"," A movie of focus, commitment and sheer will.
","It's a basic gangster revenge movie, where bad men disturb a sleeping bear and live just long enough to regret it. It is also complete fantasy, a New York city where no one who dies has has family, no innocent people get hurt, and super-assassins stay in their own luxury hotel.<br/><br/>The movie makes up its own rules, but it sticks to them: John Wick is destructible, he is not stronger than his enemies but merely faster, more resourceful, and more determined. His weapons run out of bullets, and do not do more damage than those of his opponents ... he just shoots them more accurately. It is not realistic - it isn't supposed to be - but the conflicts are balanced enough that his revenge feels earned.<br/><br/>It is also stylishly shot, the small depth of field technique adds a otherworldliness, that does not distract from the entertainment but does serve I think to distance us enough from the violence that it doesn't feel sickening.<br/><br/>But the best things about the film, what really makes it work, is the tight, focused plot, the minimal-yet-eminently-quotable dialogue, and the commitment of everyone in the cast to make their characters memorable."
"kdavies-69347","6","1","4","8 March 2016"," Solid Action But Without Substance
","I love a good revenge story. There is about these kind of tales we can get behind, choose a side, and that's usually enough to justify the violence in most movies nowadays. John Wick is a revenge story, and on merits of it's action scenes a pretty amazing ride. However where it excels in quick paced action it certainly leaves a lot to be desired in story.<br/><br/>John Wick is a well to do man in his 30's, seemingly wealthy, and in love. His wife is beautiful and she has a way of making him whole, but these things rarely last, and his world is about to come apart at the seems. He has a hidden past, something he isn't proud of, but it's what has given him this life of luxury and the ability to spend so much time with his wife. Shortly after the beginning of the film, in which we find our main character badly wounded, we enter a series of flashbacks where we learn his wife had become ill to some unknown disease, and he has very little time to process this loss. As events unfold, John returns to his old ways, on a killing spree against new foes and some old ones as well.<br/><br/>The story that unfolds isn't great by any means, but there are some real amazing action sequences of such military precision that they are a pleasure to watch. Keanu Reeves underwent 4 months of firearms training and it really shows through his work. Some of the best action sequences are the close quarters hand to hand combat, where John Wick used a lot of Japanese Jujitsu, but incorporates his firearm in so many of the moves (slightly reminiscent of the film Equilibrium 2002). Although some might be turned off by the level of violence and high body count, this is really why you watch a movie like this.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the plot itself is so outrageously thin and badly written that it kind of ruins the whole thing for me. When I think of the classic revenge story, a few titles come to mind right away. Oldboy (2013) or Django Unchained (2012) for example. The main characters of these films are men obsessed with revenge, and you can easily understand why the characters would go to such lengths to get back at the people who have done wrong by them. This is what John Wick is missing, I couldn't understand why a man would throw his life away for the memory of someone who is already dead. He goes up against an army of Mafioso's and leaves bodies all over the city, and anyone who gets in his way is a dead man... but why? I couldn't grasp that concept in this film, and it left me so unsatisfied and crying in disbelief.<br/><br/>So, it does have some of the best fire fights I've seen in a film, and excellent hand to hand choreography (Michael Nyqvist nearly lost an ear!), but the whole premise of the movie kind of fell flat in my eyes. But I hear this is the first in a trilogy so they have lots of room to improve story line in the future.<br/><br/>6/10"
"jimbo-53-186511","6","1","4","12 February 2016"," About as generic as they come but with enough thrills and spills to compensate for this
","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has been recently bereaved and as a last gift to him his late wife has given him a dog (presumably so that he won't be lonely and so that he has something to remember her by). A short while after a gang approach Wick with the intention of purchasing his car. Wick refuses to sell the car and has a minor altercation with one gang member and promptly drives off. Later, the gang track Wick down, beat him up, and kill his dog. It turns out that Wick was a former employee of Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) who is the father of the man who killed Wick's dog. When Tarasov gets wind that Wick is the man that's coming after his son, he does everything he can to defend himself against someone whom he knows is a formidable adversary.<br/><br/>When I saw the premise for this film it reminded me of Revenge For Jolly - a truly awful film involving people getting revenge against someone for killing their dog. This put me off watching this film initially as I feared that this would be another awful 'dog-related' revenge film. Thankfully John Wick is a million times better than 'Revenge For Jolly' for several reasons..... <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays the title character of John Wick and it seems that he was channelling Liam Neeson in the Taken films. Inevitably, Reeves suffers by comparison because he arguably lacks the screen presence that Neeson brings, but he is still effective here - although sometimes it is hard not to feel as though you're watching a poor man's Liam Neeson in a poor man's Taken. Even though it feels like a poor man's Taken it is still very enjoyable basically for the same reasons that Taken is a good film in that once it gets going it very rarely loses momentum guaranteeing that boredom will not set in.<br/><br/>To me it felt like directors Chad Stahelski & David Leitch had watched a few Luc Besson films as the style and the fight choreography are very similar. It's fast and frenetic and both directors do well to get a credible performance from Reeves - he's not the most reliable of actors, but is actually quite good at being emotive here and screenwriter Derek Kolstad does a good job in setting the story up and getting some heart into the film.<br/><br/>As with most action films you get the impression that action comes first and writing comes second as there are a few flaws within the script; for starters we don't learn much about Wick's former employers, nor do we learn much about what they're all about. I didn't really understand why they needed to steal his car at the start or what was going on at the place where they delivered his car to? Was it stolen to order? It also seemed contrived that the gang were able to find Wick after they left him - unless they followed him home???? <br/><br/>So yes John Wick has its fair share of flaws and yes there isn't much in the way of originality here. However, if you're looking for a fairly fast-paced thriller with plenty of impressive action sequences then this is definitely worth your time."

Keanu Reeves is delivering a fine performance I am not really a fan of him, so fine means he is not annoying but entertaining. The reasons to watch this movies are:<br/><br/>Much well paced shoot out action mixed with enjoyable martial arts. It almost feels like a music video when the actions scenes start to roll. You'll hear thick drum and bass club music. Fast cuts, painful stunts and muscle-car-show-off. The story is almost a no brainer, which is for some days perfectly okay. Usually I have my brains switched on generally. So following flaws spoiled this fast cooked action fast food soup:<br/><br/>The story and development of characters is static and very predictable. What the movie also lacks is a real terrifying evil antagonist. Look, on one hand we have Keanu who really is bad ass. On the evil side we have Michael Nyqvist a mafia boss. But I don't believe him. I was wondering where is the real mafia boss not his writer.<br/><br/>After all the movie is a box office success. If I would have paid a cinema ticket I would have regret the waste of money.

","Ever wondered what The Matrix's bullet-stopping Neo (Keanu Reeves) would be like in the real world? He would probably be like John Wick, the eponymous former assassin of co-directors Chad Stahelski and the uncredited David Leitch's refreshing action movie, which puts coherency back into set-pieces and polishes its simplistic premise with buckets of style. There's a key scene in the middle of the movie where Wick sledge-hammers his way through the concrete floor of his basement to reveal a hoard of buried weapons. He is literally digging up his past, and is symbolic of the films refusal to have its protagonist brood over heavy themes and its willingness to simply let him get down to business.<br/><br/>That business, unfortunately for a gang of Russian mobsters, is of a highly skilled assassin. Mourning the recent death of the woman he left his life of crime behind for, John Wick receives a puppy, who his wife arranged to be sent to him upon her death, At a gas station, the cocky Iosef (Alfie Allen) - the son of a mob boss - spots Wick's '69 Mustang, and when Wick refuses to sell, Iosef and his cronies break into his house, kill his dog, and leave him battered and bloodied. Iosef's father Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) finds out and begins to contemplate the inevitable - Wick's warpath of revenge and the death of his son. Taking residence at a hotel that caters for men of his ilk, Wick finds himself waste-deep in the life he thought he had left behind.<br/><br/>There's a lot of joy to be had with the boldness of John Wick. Operatic, overblown and featuring a scene of Viggo muttering a tale of the boogeyman to himself in a room lit by a roaring fireplace, it transcends its straight-to-DVD plot with some outlandish and truly thrilling set-pieces. Free of shaky-cam and rapid editing, Wick shoots, stabs and strangles his way through an endless Russian hoard, and allows a flowing camera to capture his ass-kickery. Reeves is at his best when he says little, and he's virtually silent here, delivering a performance of endearing sullenness. It is by no means a great film - it's hampered by genre conventions and a wafer- thin plot - but you certainly get what you came in for."

","James Bond, Jack Bauer, Jason Bourn, Jack Reacher, John Carter, and now John Wick - writers do seem to have limited imaginations when it comes to the names of their action heroes. JW is a retired assassin and we all know that, in the movies, it doesn't take much to bring a man with ""a very particular set of skills"" back into the game. Kidnapping his daughter usually does it but, if you want to be sure, kill his dog. This really makes Wick (Keanu Reeves back on cracking form) mad. Of course, we knew who the bad guys were even before their mistake with the mutt because they speak Russian and the subtitles are presented in comic book style to add to the fun.<br/><br/>There's minimal plot but maximum action in this film directed by Chad Stahelski (Keanu's stunt double in ""The Matrix"") and David Leitch (another veteran stunt coordinator). Wick is not out simply to disable his foes but instead never leaves death in doubt and he is no silent assassin but absolutely litters the screen in bodies in a riot of action and noise that somehow escapes the notice of the New York Police Department. According to those who count these things, the original ""Taken"" movie clocked up a body count of 35 but Wick racks up a much superior 76. <br/><br/>I saw the movie on an IMAX screen so I was both shaken and stirred."

It gives an holistic view of gangland and rules they live in and high respect for each other. Icing on the cake is the well-choreographed action scenes which has been executed brilliantly with graphic bloodshed looking like a PC game. Script is tight and will keep you engaged. The flip-side is unnecessary inclusion of climax scenes which could be easily be edited. Keanue Reeves is back in form and I loved him after long time especially post Matrix series.

","John Wick starts with promise and quickly devolves into stupidity, hijacking the current template for action films pioneered by 'The Raid' series in which a single, determined 'hero' takes up arms against hundreds of nameless, one dimensional bad guys in a rapid fire killing spree. <br/><br/>It's not that I have anything against bloodshed in film, provided it serves a purpose. But there's really nothing of substance here to grab onto, leaving us with scene after scene of revenge-murder chic that plays more like a video game than a film. Never has cold blooded murder looked so cool.<br/><br/>John Wick is nicely shot and opens on a dreary and mysterious note, one that I wish the film would have sustained with a better story and better character development. Without the fundamentals we might as well be pressing buttons. Jump, Wick. Dive, Wick. Shoot, Wick.<br/><br/>If I try and step back and critique it purely as action entertainment - the film is lacking in interesting choreography or chase sequences. Basically Wick happens upon completely unbelievable scenarios over and over again, pulls a gun out and shoots. No matter how many times the filmmakers put him into uncompromising positions, I never feel like he's in any danger. The routine gets boring after the first half hour and eventually the autopilot sets in."

","As the title clearly tells us, this movie is really about one man - John Wick. John is a sort of super (perhaps even super-human) hit man for the Russian Mob. But he's retired. He found love; he got married; everything was great; he left the life. But his wife got sick and then died, and as her parting gift to the devastated John, she arranges for him to be sent a puppy after she died. The puppy comforts him in his grief. Until ... One day he has an encounter with the son of the Russian mob boss he used to work for. They don't know each other. The guy falls in love with John's car, and later breaks into John's house, beats John up, kills John's puppy and steals John's car. It was the killing of the puppy - the last link with his beloved wife - that pushed John over the top. He's back, and he's out for revenge: bloody, merciless and remorseless revenge against anybody and everybody even remotely involved with this heinous act.<br/><br/>That's it, more or less. The movie then goes through a whole series of bloody gunfights and fistfights and martial arts sequences as John (Keanu Reeves) single-handedly wreaks havoc on the Russian Mob in New York City. The fight scenes go on and on and on. They seem never-ending. It was a very one-dimensional part for Reeves (but, then again, most of the characters in this were one dimensional.) The point of the movie wasn't to tell a story or to give us meaningful moments and characters. They were all pretty one dimensional, working with a plot that was straightforward and largely predictable. This is obviously all leading up to the climactic confrontation. Admittedly, I wasn't entirely sure who John's final confrontation was going to be with until the son was killed with almost a half hour left to go. Clearly it wasn't him. So it goes on and on and on for a while longer.<br/><br/>Personally, I found the last half hour quite tedious viewing. If you really like this kind of genre - violent and bloody action with little or no story - then this is a movie you've got to watch. I have to admit that this just really wasn't my style, even though I can appreciate a man wanting to take revenge for the killing of his puppy! (3/10)"

The body count is completely ridiculous. Or maybe just absurd, not sure. I won't give away John Wick's motivation, but let's just say he overreacts just a bit. You take a bite of his muffin, and he will kill your family type of overreaction. Stay away from this movie, complete waste of time, not a single redeeming thing here."

","At first I was content with the cinematography and the story. It got me sucked in feeling cosy and poetic about the choreography of killing people in large numbers. This film has a covert aura that wants to make you feel good about seeing hundred bad guys shot in an aesthetic manner. I realized I was enjoying how the lead character was shooting people skilfully and with style. There is no artistic aspiration or audacious in-depth exploration of the drama of life. In 'Kill Bill' maybe there was an attempt of that. In John Wick it is just a guy that uses his guns like a ninja his swords.<br/><br/>From the cinematographic viewpoint, however, this is a film well done."

There's really nothing else to it. Nothing new or interesting happens. There's just some action which isn't very new , its all been seen before. When it ended, I thought, thank God for that. I feel I've said all I need to but the minimum submission is 10 lines. So I'll waffle on a bit more. Couching Tiger Hidden Dragon was good because it had exceptional action and it was all new and refreshing. But just your standard action flick, we've all seen it all before. There's really no story line.

There was some very good realism that you rarely see in movies, mostly in the action sequences (John actually reloads!!) They used really cool unique subtitles for the Russian dialogue. And some of the comic relief in serious situations was perfect! My issues with the film have a lot to do with the story, and characters I never was really interested in Mr. Wick or anyone else there. I found myself waiting for the next action sequence rather than enjoying the story itself. I also have had a hard time with Keanu Reeves ever since I first saw him in Hardball.That combined with my lack of excitement for most action movies today due to clichés is the reason I gave this a B (6/10). #JohnWick #KeanuReeves #Hitman #ActionMovie"

"Otakore","5","1","5","4 December 2015"," I find it cool at first and eventually unbelievably funny as the story goes
","When the Kingpin learned about whom did his son messed up with, It's John Wick, that's where the hype started. Eventually, as the story goes, the hype is kind of messed up.<br/><br/>I'm kind of unsatisfied about how John Wick kills his enemies. His killer moves is not a move of a killer. It's not poor acting. I guess, It's just a fair acting. He moves so lame and looked untrained. It's like his enemies have a lot of chances to gunned him down, but they're not taking the chances.<br/><br/>One more ridiculous scene is when Viggo caught John Wick and tied him in a chair. Yes, Viggo didn't kill him in that part even after John Wick ambushed him in the Church. But after Viggo interrogated him, he commanded his guard to kill John Wick. The funny thing, the guard tries to kill John Wick with a plastic bag. The man who is feared, known by the killer circle, will be killed with a plastic bag by suffocation? Seriously? But that didn't succeed because his old friend who first tried to kill him saves him.<br/><br/>At the end, Viggo and John Wick battles hand-to-hand and then hand-to-knife because Viggo thinks he's going to lose it so he used a knife. The fight scene is very unacceptable. I remember Viggo told his son that John Wick killed three men in a bar with just a pencil. And then the film give us the said funny fight scene. John Wick was able to stab Viggo in the right shoulder while Viggo stabbed John Wick in the stomach. What's more lethal and what's the chance of survival when you're stabbed in the stomach versus stabbed in your left shoulder? You don't need a medical degree to decide the obvious. The film defies biology. Viggo died because he was stabbed in the shoulder. And John Wick survived the lethality of his injury. What the hell!<br/><br/>I think, my vote is just fair. I enjoyed the first half of the film which is good til the second & last half of the film which gives an unbelievable poor story."

","I'm a big fan of action movies and especially Keanu Reeves. He often gets crap over his acting skills (or lack thereof). I think hes well suited to action movies, where a lot of the time story is told through the action sequences and a bit more nuanced. <br/><br/>It's hard to find fault with this movie, and I've seen it at least 3-4 times. All the actors supporting or main do a great job. There is a lot of action in this movie, and the movie does start out a bit slow, but then picks up very quickly. <br/><br/>The action, gun fu and stunts are awesome, some of the best I've seen in a long time. You can tell they really practiced and tweaked the stunts a lot. <br/><br/>There are often long action segments with a brief intermission of story, which is how I like most of my movies. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing as well, with Marilyn Manson contributing to the main theme of the movie and the composer for the movie doing a great job. <br/><br/>I would have liked to see William Dafoe's character expanded on some more but that may come in the second movie (in flashback sequences)."
"brchthethird","6","1","5","25 July 2015"," Ruthlessly efficient action that still left me wanting
","Word-of-mouth can be very useful in gauging if a film is worth seeing or not, but it can also lead to erroneous expectations. I went into this thinking it would be this absolutely awesome action romp, and to a degree that's true. I just thought it would also be a little more fun. JOHN WICK is by no means a bad film, but one that seems satisfied with a cool soundtrack and brutal, well-choreographed action while having a rather weak foundation of a story. The setup is that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who gets dragged back into the life after a Russian gangster's upstart son foolishly steals his car and murders his dog. That's it. I wasn't expecting anything deep, mind you, but I would have liked a little more complexity and intrigue. It was straight-forward almost to the point of being boring at times, and without a lot of the production and character design that fleshed out something like MAD MAX FURY ROAD, or the manic humor of KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE. To the film's credit, the action goes against the current trend of flashy camera-work and tricky editing, so one is able to comprehend and appreciate the brutality and choreography. And even though a lot of it takes place at night, geography is never in question and you can tell where people are in relation to each other. These elements were also well-supported by some good special effects, bullet hits, etc. In terms of the world of the film, there were a few nice touches that hinted at a complex criminal underworld, one where assassins have their own hotel and criminals use their own currency. The film was also well-acted for the most part, despite the characters being so shallow apart from Keanu Reeves' John Wick. To me, the film largely wasted talented actors like Ian McShane, Michael Nyqvist and Willem Dafoe by not really giving them anything fun or interesting to do. When it comes down to it, all the film really has is Keanu Reeves' charisma and some admittedly good action, and that wasn't really enough for me. Bringing this back full-circle, expectations can make or break a film and I think I went into this expecting a little too much. For the die-hard action fan who doesn't really care how much story goes along the beatings and bullets, JOHN WICK will do just fine. For those who expect a little more from a film, there's plenty of others to choose from."
"nikkijames-writes","8","1","5","18 July 2015"," It's not bad
","Some of these reviews are a joke. Loosen your shorts people! I'm not sure what some thought they were going to get with Keanu in another action movie... a shoot 'em up, high body count, fast action, and shiny cars movie... But a classic, meaningful flick was never in the cards. <br/><br/>If you don't like gun fights, video games style action, or fast cars - you won't like this movie. <br/><br/>This movie is like a country song. He lost his wife, lost his dog, and lost his car - and then he gets revenge on the spoiled idiot mobsters son (it took me half the movie to figure out that was the guy from GOT, I knew his face I just could t remember who he was!) who had no idea who he was messing with. <br/><br/>Is it realistic? That depends on how much realism you expect to gain from AN ACTION MOVIE. Are they ever? Nope. Not one of them. It's got about as much realism as Kill Bill (which I love). That does not make it a bad movie. The thing I do like about this move - if nothing else - is they showed him reloading his weapons multiple times, action movies don't typically do that, so they get points for not having guns that never run out of bullets. <br/><br/>As for the acting:<br/><br/>Keanu - he did a great job with this. John Wick is stoic and not in a good place at all, and they messed with him on the wrong damn day! I actually prefer him when he's not the hero good guy. When he plays a darker role he seems more relaxed... Guess there's no hero pressure there. <br/><br/>My only complaint is Willem Dafoe & Ian Macshane didn't have bigger roles, but they did a great job with what they did have. <br/><br/>Im so tired of reviews blasting thrill-ride movies because they're not how the reviewer thinks an action movie should be. It's easy to criticize when you're not the one putting the work in. Is it perfect? Nope. But it's fun - if you like this brand of fun."
"blakiepeterson","6","1","5","24 June 2015"," An Entertaining Revenge Film
","Ah, the revenge film. Is it possible not to root for a masochistic protagonist who feels the need to slaughter the people who did them wrong? Whether it involves Uma Thurman slashing Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, and an odd assortment of Japanese bodyguards or Lee Marvin thirsty for retribution after being left for dead, there is something lip-smackingly satisfying about seeing a badass make fair and square with all the wrong people.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" is as much a comeback vehicle for Keanu Reeves as it is a sumptuously shot throwback to the days of Charles Bronson and Sylvester Stallone. The film doesn't necessarily update what we've come to know about the revenge movie over the years — it, instead, provides for a refreshing take on a subgenre that, in a world accustomed to Liam Neeson threatening kidnap happy terrorists, has gotten a bit dusty. Here is a movie that knows it's predictable, but is smart enough to understand that going through the motions just won't do this time around. Like the ""Kill Bills"" before it, everything is so stylistically visceral that we hardly have time to roll our eyes and remember that the hero always finds the fulfillment they're looking for. We have to sit back and enjoy the blood soaked ride. <br/><br/>Reeves, after years away from the action scene, portrays Wick as a man wounded by his past. He was a hit-man years ago, but left the scene in pursuit of a blissful marriage. As the film opens, however, his wife has, as it seems, died of a serious illness (which is never explained). Damaged assassins are never a good thing, and after his grieving process is interrupted by a gaggle of Russian thugs who steal his car and kill his dog, something in Wick snaps. He goes from loving husband to murder machine in a matter of seconds, and so the film goes on autopilot, but not in the ways you might expect.<br/><br/>The plot feels very been there, done that, and Reeves, who I've always labeled as the most wooden leading man in Hollywood, goes through the motions without a single ounce of emotion to back him up. (Even in a scene where he breaks down, we are hardly convinced he looks anything other than a circa 2009 Kristen Stewart's father.) Somehow, though, ""John Wick"" doesn't seem to be about plot, or Reeves, for that matter: rather, we are intent on how the plot is executed, how the action set pieces set themselves apart from the other thrill heavy movies of the decade or, cough cough, ""The Matrix"". And, for the most part, we are presented with an entertaining revenge movie, one who takes its gun fu very seriously and one who just finds violence artistic as long as it's done right. Chad Stahelski, making his directorial debut here, is confident in his every move, making ""John Wick""'s sleek thrills pack more punches than your average pulpy exercise in madness.<br/><br/>This is a well-made movie, no doubt, but I'm not so sure it presents us with anything new. It's all been done before (though here it's quite a bit more stylish, obsessing itself with a Michael Mann reminiscent tinting process) and it's been done better. But maybe I'm just cynical because ""Kill Bill"" is close to being the best thing ever, and no revenge film can ever come close to its greatness. It's hard to get over your first love, after all."
"MovieHoliks","6","1","5","30 June 2015"," Better Than Expected...
","I saw this latest Keanu Reeves actioner off HBO over the weekend, and to my pleasant surprise- it was actually pretty decent. Reeves plays a hit- man (one of the most deadliest around) who retires after making a deal with the his crime boss (Michael Nyqvist) so he can settle down and be with his new bride (Bridget Moynahan). Only problem is she dies shortly thereafter, but leaves him a parting gift- something to remember her by; which happens to be a cute little puppy. He bonds with the pup, but then gets into a scuffle with some local gangsters, who kill the poor thing ( frown emoticon ), and John Wick steps back into his hit-man shoes in ultra-vengeance mode!<br/><br/>This is one of the best roles I've seen Keanu in for some time now, and hear this may be the beginning of a franchise-?? I hope so; would like to see more of this bad-ass character! I see this film was actually inspired by a few different action classics (John Woo's ""The Killer"", Jean-Pierre Melville's ""Le Cercle Rouge"" and ""Le Samouraï"", John Boorman's ""Point Blank"", and the spaghetti western subgenre of Western films); and you can definitely see that influence when watching this. Ian McShane, John Leguizama and Willem Dafoe co-star."
"brillmongo","3","1","5","16 June 2015"," Pretty lights, poor show
","Very minor spoilers ahead<br/><br/>It's for the most part nicely shot and nicely lit. Keanu Reeves, despite hamming it up with an unnecessarily raspy voice in every scene, is also capable as the lead and there are several strong supporting characters that provide for some depth in an otherwise simplistic and shallow plot.<br/><br/>There ends all the good I have to say on the subject of John Wick.<br/><br/>Strangely enough one of the primary failures of John Wick is the sound design, it's not as godawful as Chappie with its belt fed rifles but there is a terrible discordancy here between what we're shown and what we hear. The soundtrack in particular sticks out like a sore thumb whenever Wick's ""man with a purpose"" leitmotif lights up. There's something to be said of the missed opportunity of including somber jazz or grunge and instead going with generic and grating hard rock in a movie which is otherwise more tonally similar to noir than typical action fare.<br/><br/>The plot's pacing and direction is where the film really begins to lose me however and it becomes clear rather quick that little forethought or planning was put into the script. Wick is described as a loser for example by a man who spent the preceding night trashing his very un-loser-like home and stealing a car that he admired so much he would rather keep than sell to his fence. Not enough time is spent on the titular character himself either to establish him in any way, instead what we get is a couple lines spoken about him in hushed reverence from another character - who neither he has been properly introduced at that point. And from that point on the rest of the movie is singularly focused on the revenge plot and while it plays out in a number of visually interesting settings the fight choreography, visual effects and inconsistent behaviour of Wick as well as the extremely long scenes make for a complete doozy. Instead of allowing for a gradual buildup of tension followed by brief bursts of violence our Hero dispatches enemies with such ease and in such great numbers that it's hard not to think you're watching Max Payne: The Movie. I'm reminded of a quote regarding droids in the Star Wars prequels, if our heroes are able to deal with these enemies with such ease and in such great numbers that their presence is entirely inconsequential, why even include them?<br/><br/>Finally there's the issue of our Russian crime boss being played by someone with a very obvious Swedish accent. I don't hold anything against Michael Nyquist but he's a poor fit for ""menacing bad guy"" and even if he were able to speak English without his accent there's precious little he could do with the pathetic dialogue afforded his character. Attempting to pass of a Swedish man as a Russian mobster so jarred me out of the movie I ended up simply fast-forwarding past any scene where he made an appearance, which of course meant John Wick took a nosedive towards the end.<br/><br/>It might be interesting to consider for a moment what could've been done with the basic themes and characters here if the project was in the hands of a competent director, editor, makeup team and effects artists but it'd be a lot simpler to simply say - don't bother."

"ahegde3149","6","1","5","22 May 2015"," Maybe not my taste..
","I believe action movies are not quite my thing, as most Hollywood action is generic these days. John Wick the latest one I saw, is overall quite similar to another recent action flick The Equalizer. One retired specialist is brought back in action to destroy an entire mafia gang. It may entertain hardcore action lovers, but for me its utter boredom. At least, The Equalizer was backed up with some story, which is almost absent here. John Wick is an ex-hit-man who had retired to leave peacefully with his wife. Unfortunately she dies o cancer and all John Wick is left with is his super-cool Mustang and the dog his wife leaves as a gift. But John is pulled back into the action when his car is stolen and dog killed by the mafia head's son. Driven by grief and revenge he decides to take down the people involved using his super-hit-man skills. That's basically the entire story and what fills the 100 minutes is routine monotonic action sequence. They are not bad being nicely shot and well-choreographed actually. The problem is the lack of intent and the totally predictable nature of the script which made it less engaging. There aren't any twist in the story too which is surprising. Just plain straight forward action. If that's all you I believe you will end up having a good time.<br/><br/>Just like in The Equalizer, John Wick easily kills dozens of men failing to do so only twice and both the times escapes in what I would say the lamest part of he script. I found it hardly realistic. There is absolutely no tension built up as you know that John Wick can easily kick everyone's asses. Character build up is weak, dialogues just forward the action sequences and acting nothing special. Keenu Reeves gives an honest attempt though, still I couldn't connect with John Wick that much to completely root for him. To end, this was just another forgettable action film for me.<br/><br/>RATING: [2/5]"
"harihar90","8","1","5","20 May 2015"," Brilliantly atmospheric, action-packed entertainer
","Rare is the film which strikes on the perfect mix of world-creation, atmosphere and action. Superbly shot in metallic shades of dark blue, grey and black, set in a world that can ( and should, if you ask me) spawn a cinematic universe on its own, and proceeding with a glorious sense of fun, John Wick is 'the' action movie. And say what you will about Keanu Reeves' acting, he can play a cypher pretty well. Keanu Reeves is John Wick, an ex-super-hit-man who is recovering from a personal tragedy. A couple of gangsters 'disturb' his mourning- the bloodshed starts from there and does not stop till the end of the film! The film is highly reminiscent of the 80's Hong Kong actioners such as 'A Better Tomorrow', both in style and in the themes explored (such as the impossibility of 'retirement' from the criminal world). This movie is highly recommended for any action fan and if your heart does not leap with joy when Victor, the main antagonist says 'No, Wick is not the Boogeyman.He is the guy we send to kill the Boogeyman!' , you are dead inside!"

","Well, everyone knows this is a revenge movie with lots of action. And, yeah. There's lots of action. But honestly - that's all there is. There isn't much in the way of character. I never figured out why the Willem Dafoe character acted the way he did. There's no humor to speak of. I didn't find the action sequences to be very creative, and I actually found them to be repetitive. For example there was one plot element where a lot of people are waiting for Wick to come and they are all checking in with each other by radio... and then exactly the same thing happens later on. <br/><br/>There's lots and lots and lots of action but it's amazing how soporific it all got. And I mean it literally put me to sleep. I was pay-per-viewing it and I literally dozed off. More than once. It had been a long day at work, I admit. But if it had had any hook to hold my attention, I would have stayed awake. But it didn't. Well, there is this comic-book assassin subculture stuff with an economy based on special gold coins, but nobody past the fourth grade could believe in it.<br/><br/>So I was honestly pretty disappointed. And I'm not someone who can't enjoy a good action film. Take ""Salt"", for example, which was also non-stop action, but which I found way more interesting and with more plot twists and stuff. There aren't really any plot twists in this movie. It was just entirely first-person-shooter for an hour and a half. Now, if someone says, ""But that's exactly the kind of movie I like! You're just biased against first-person-shooter non-stop hitting and pulling the trigger movies!"" I guess I don't have a good retort. But there it is."

A former enforcer for the Russian Mob he is feared as 'Baba Yaga', which we are told again and again is 'The Boogeyman'. That anyone remotely aware of folklore can tell you that Baba ISN'T the Boogeyman is the least of this film's narrative flaws: the Curious Incident Of The Kevlar Vest That Vanished In The Night is a fairly major plot-goof.<br/><br/>That it works is down to Reeves's deadpan delivery of some preposterous dialogue, the playful use of supporting actors: Ian McShane, Clarke Peters and Lance Reddick are very amusing. More could be made of Michael Nyqvist, and Alfie Allen seems to be destined for a career playing a succession of disappointing sons.<br/><br/>Also, if you like shoot-'em-ups this is very much your film - or franchise, I should say: the producers intentions in that regard are very clear long before the credits roll. Reeves offs a ludicrous number of baddies - I literally lost count in the mid-50s - while having only one of their weapons come anywhere near him..and only THEN because that Kevlar vest I mentioned seems to have inexplicably evaporated between scenes!<br/><br/>As I say, very silly indeed...but fun if you are amused by cartoon violence."

Then I waited for it to come out on DVD and watched it again and thats when I decided it was the greatest action movie of all time. This movie gives you everything you want in an action movie! The story is perfect, it grabs you and keeps you hooked the entire time. They give you an action hero to root for the whole movie. The movie does an amazing job with first getting you to see John Wick as a human so you can understand the pain he is in and then the movie builds him up to be a feared and respected legend of this underworld and when the action starts you will understand why it is the greatest action movie of all time. The gun play in this movie is by far the best I have ever seen in any movie. John Wick kills so many people it is awesome, read the trivia section to find out how many! Keanu Reeves gives the performance of his career. The directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch were stunt men their whole careers and John Wick is the first movie they have ever directed, which explains why the action is so perfect in this movie. I don't want to give any spoilers because I know as a huge movie fan that nothing is worse than finding out too many details before you see a movie. Trust me and go see John Wick right away! I recommend this movie to everyone!! I give John Wick a 10 out of 10!! A++"

","I was hoping that Keanu Reeves would resurrect his career with 47 Ronin, a remarkably boring film with some interesting CGI. Here comes John Wick, from marketing to execution, a bare-bones action flick that leaves nothing to be desired except a better plot. Reeves' titular character is a retired hit man who is unwittingly robbed by the son of a Russian mob boss. In the process, John Wick's puppy is killed. The puppy was a gift from his dead wife who died of cancer days before. Apparently, John Wick feels he has nothing left to lose. John Wick is determined to destroy the man who killed his puppy, no matter how many Russian mobsters must die in the process. And boy, do they die! In terms of action/adventure, special effects, etc. this film is an example of doing more with less. The action scenes had none of that CGI music video feel; they were all realistically choreographed and shot, which helps a lot with the suspension of disbelief. The performances are about as good as the script will allow, but nothing stands up to scrutiny. With John Wick being as unstoppable as he appears to be, it's odd that he would have been the hapless victim of a home invasion. And why, why won't we listen to reason? As the film is aware, ""it was just an f-ing dog.'"

That is, a Character that is Myopic, Speaks in Short Stunted Sentences, and Never looks Distracted by anything requiring Thought beyond those Instinctive and Highly Trained Survival Skills.<br/><br/>This is one of those that must be Applauded for Not Reneging on its Promise to deliver what You pay for. It knows its Target Audience and doesn't try a bit to Educate, Enlighten, or Expand Their Worldview. It Serves Up just what is expected and required to Not Disappoint.<br/><br/>Thanks also for the R Rating. No Cop Out Fudging the Violence. That would have been a disaster.

","Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>Go see this movie if: - you like very fast-paced action flicks - you don't need a super-complicated plot - you like to see a good guy kill lots of bad guys - you appreciate noir (and you understand what it is) - you like to see a well constructed 'world'<br/><br/>DO not see this movie if: - you don't like violence - you have no appreciation/understanding of noir - you need the 'good-guy' to be totally a good person - you have no appreciation for ultra-violence done _really_ well - you don't like revenge movies - you expect the Disney logo at the start of every 'good' movie<br/><br/>This is the best action movie in years. I say this as an action-flick junkie who likes ultra-violence but not torture-porn. <br/><br/>The plot is simple and linear by design. It does not need to be complicated or 'twisty' - we all should know what is going to happen and the enjoyment is seeing how this unfolds. If you cannot understand that this plot setup also indicates the intent and, to a certain extent, the setup of the noir, then you will not like this movie.<br/><br/>Said more bluntly ""the killing of the puppy is stupid by design, it is there to show that the bad-men are really bad and that this event is a simplistic device to unleash carnage"". <br/><br/>The beauty of this movie is in the world/noir. We get assassins who have their own hotel, their own currency, their own creed and their own body disposal service. The rules of this world are presented and then adhered to - and are quite interesting. A couple good examples are when a cop comes to John Wick's house after John has shot 12 people (who were sent to kill him). John opens the door to the cop, who he knows by first name, and says ""noise complaint?"". And after the cop sees dead bodies/blood behind John, he says (deadpan) ""you working again?"". This is a fantastic scene in a movie with a bunch of them. <br/><br/>Another is when John enters a club where his intended victim has been stashed. He puts a gun to the head of the bouncer at the entrance, who he knows, and they talk about his losing weight (while the gun is pressed to his head). The bouncer then asks tentatively ""are you here on business?"" knowing that John will likely kill him as he is protecting the bad guys. Instead John says ""why don't you take the night off?"". Another great scene in a great movie.<br/><br/>Finally, the music is very good both the songs that were integrated into the movie (""Killing Strangers"" by Marilyn Manson) and the soundtrack.<br/><br/>For context, I found The Equalizer and Jack Reacher to be two of the better action movies to come out in the last couple of years, but this movie blows them away....."

"Screen_Blitz","8","1","5","9 February 2015"," Sweet, stylish action flick that redefines Keanu Reeves as a visceral action hero
","With the action genre running low on fresh, if not entirely original ideas over the past several years; this stylish action film starring Keanu Reeves as the titular character is one that comes with surprise. This movie sees Reeves reuniting with Chad Stahelski and David Leitch who served as the fight choreographers for the 'Matrix' trilogy, and redefining himself as a new hero with high-trained set of skills with guns and hand-to-hand combat. Although Reeves is no stranger to the action genre since he exploded as the visceral action hero Neo in the Matrix, this film pins the actor into a fine, polished role as a gun-totting hero facing down the guys. Calling this film is a game-changer in the genre would be saying a bit much, but it does indeed stand as one of the most entertaining films of the category. In further words, it shows the genre is still far from dead. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a former assassin devastated by the death of his wife. After days of mourning, Wick is surprised with a gift of cute little puppy to help cope with his lonesomeness. While trying to readjust to his life, Wick is visited by a group of Russian mobsters lead by Losef Tarasov (played by Alfie Allen), son of corrupt mob moss Viggo Tarasov (played by Michael Nyqvist), who brutally attack him, destroy his house, steal his Mustang, and murder his poor little puppy. In an act of revenge, Wick must rally up his former accomplices including Marcus (played by William DeFore) and chop shop owner Aurelio (played by John Leguizamo) to hunt them down.<br/><br/>This movie provides action movie junkies with plenty of thrills and visceral action set pieces to fuel the adrenaline for most. Although the plot is rather thin and falls short of originality beyond a simple revenge story, the major driving force of the film is the dazzlingly choreographed action sequences along with the compelling character study of our tragic titular protagonist. From the opening scene, John Wick is established as a man with a grim past and faces a deep tragedy with the death of his wife from an illness that is never specified. The beginning effectively breaths humanity into the character without being overly sappy or manipulative, and the final product is a protagonist viewers can sympathize with; even when he journeys to the dark side of gunning down countless individuals. When the action begins, it is truly stunning. The first action set piece takes place in the main character's house where he fights and mows down an array of criminals in a sequence choreographed in a style of what almost resembles a poetic dance routine. And this scene is only the beginning of the enormously high body count he racks up throughout the film. While the action scenes stand out gracefully, the film's shortcoming perhaps come from the characters, mostly from the antagonist category. Alfie Allen and Michael Nyqvist both do their duty in the villain roles but fall victim to rather underwritten characters. Why did they try to kill John Wick, a explanation is never deeply explored (or at least not in a way that is understandable). And William DeFoe's character is given rather little to do. Overall, these come as only minor gripes and should not stand in the way to witness the alluring direction Chad Stahelski and David Leitch drive this fast-paced vehicle.<br/><br/>John Wick is a sleek, stylish action thriller that redefines its charismatic lead actor as a visceral action hero, and at best, sprouts as a shining star in the slowly diminishing genre. This film may not shine as a game changer in the genre, it clearly sets a solid example of what meets the criteria of a good action flick."
"lamerok","5","1","5","7 February 2015"," What a waste of talent
","I wanted to like this movie. I like Keanu Reeves (Point Break is one of my all-time favourite movies) and this got good reviews on IMDb. I don't expect too much from the plot of an action movie, just that it sort of makes sense and there are really good action scenes. However, this script was so terrible that I just could not suspend my disbelief.<br/><br/>The production values are very good and the cast is great but this movies just doesn't make any sense. The action scenes, which are the best part of the movie, are just too routine to be very interesting. <br/><br/>!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, is that Keanu Reeves' character, John Wick, is a retired hit-man. The son of the man that Wick used to work for comes to Wick's house and beats him up, kills his dog and steals his car. Lots of revenge killings and mayhem then ensue. <br/><br/>Prior to the son attacking John Wick, they have a brief altercation at a gas station where the son asks how much Wick's car is and Wick says it's not for sale and they both call each other a bitch in Russian. <br/><br/>Literally every single other person in the movie instantly recognizes John Wick (including a police officer who comes to his door) and knows that he is a hit-man even though he has been retired for 4 or 5 years. However, neither the son nor his entourage recognize John Wick and the son has not even heard of him. Wick also doesn't recognize the son of the man he used to work for, or any of the son's goons, even though he speaks to him in Russian at the gas station. <br/><br/>The problems with the script continue from there."

"tiberianfiend","Null","2","18","26 October 2014"," Slightly better than mediocre
","John Wick is an unapologetically R-rated action film with action scenes that are fast but not too choppy to follow, but unfortunately, it's also a modernized action film burdened with overuse of color grading, lens flare, and irritating rock music, and the film takes too long to get past the exposition and into the action. The former slightly outweighs the latter, so I give John Wick a 6/10. Would recommend waiting for this to come out on your favorite video service to watch, unless you're desperate for something to watch in the theaters. Still, I have to give Hollywood kudos for attempting an original R-rated action film, and hope this is part of a continuing trend that can lead to better action movies for adults."

","Apparently this is entertainment, when in reality it is a piece of 1962 propaganda wrapped in a package that got lost in 2014. Nothing much to see here: just the usual Hollywood anti-Russian propaganda. A man's dog gets killed...and who's the baddies? The Russians, of course. This just shows me that since 1962 up to now we haven't moved forward one bit - a lot of movies are still filled with anti-Russian propaganda, but the directors never contemplate about the dark side of imperialist states like the USA and Britain. They are probably going to make a movie sometime about how the USA and Britain have never lost a war and how they are always doing everything perfect and never lost a single soldier in a battle. Go and watch this if you want to be tormented by the usual egoistic protagonist who takes out a whole bunch of Russians. A lot of people argued that the fight scenes are brilliantly done, but that doesn't compensate for the egoism and downright propaganda of the story. Lighting visuals are quite good and here and there you will find some suspenseful moments, but don't get too excited: suspenseful moments that have the potential to be constructed into psychological masterpieces are merely watered down and consumed by the apparent ""heroism"" of the protagonist."

I suspect you will either love or hate this film, but if you like kick-ass, high-adrenalin films about vigilantes, then I suspect, like me, you'll love this film. It's beautifully shot, for a start. The action never lets up for a second and yet unlike many modern movies where you can't work out what's happening half the time, this is stylised and perfectly framed. It's a violent movie in the best possible way. It's all violence from almost the first frame to the last and yet it packs a huge emotional punch too. These aren't shallow caricatures and I was totally invested in the outcome of the epic battle. Keanu Reeves is one of my favourite actors and he's a revelation in this film. His emotionally contained acting style suits this character John Wick entirely. I would liken this performance to that of another great actor Mads Mikkelsen. Mads can convey more by a flick of an eye than most actors can with long speeches. I will watch John Wick again. It's a film to return to when the dross coming out of Hollywood gets you down."

","My parents own the DVD I watched of this movie and I borrowed it from them. It took me forever to watch it, but now I am happy to report that I have viewed the film so now I can return the copy back to my parents. It turned out to be a rather good action movie as well kind of in the same vein as the Punisher films and the film Dredd. Lots of action, a lot of bloody action that is. This film is almost non stop action as the set up of this film is very brief before it introduces us to John Wick's dark side and the insane criminal world he lives in. Granted, it seems as if this film was based on something as there were a lot of rules in this criminal world that seemed almost like we, as the viewer should already know, but I do not believe it was based on a book or graphic novel.<br/><br/>The film starts out with John Wick (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) looking in rather rough condition and then we spend the rest of the film finding out what happened to put him in the place he is. His wife recently passed and after a very unfortunate turn of bad luck and timing he must go after some people that have wronged him. He will have to take on former allies as he wages a one man war against the head of a criminal family.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves does a good job as the title character and he apparently put a lot of work in training wise to play the man with special skills. The other cast members do a good job too, but the only other recognizable ones were only in the film for brief periods. I thought the film was going to be devoid of humor, but it had some moments here and there as it was funny to see how quickly people were to let John Wick off the hook as they had no urge to cross him.<br/><br/>So all in all a good film as it was a bit of a super violent action flick...something the last Expendable film failed to be. It did not hold back on the violence, but I am a bit surprised that there was no nudity as I was sure there was going to be some in the couple of clubs that John came across. It does use computer blood, unfortunately, as it seems they must use computers for even some of the most basic special effects these days. However, my complaints are few as this one kept me entertained throughout."

Im glad i didn't went to the cinema to see these movie because was just a waste of time and money, and for shure i couldn't stand the entire movie. Normally the star reviews are very accurate, but in these case these movie doesn't reach near 6."

","It's an action movie. That's all it is. It's thick with clichés, silly dialogue, plot holes, bland characters, and a watery feel - in fact, one could argue that that aspect pulls the viewer out of the experience. But at the same time, it's full of lowest-common- denominator emotions, great cinematography, fast and fun gunfights, and it has a huge overall entertainment value. If you're looking for a smart movie, this is not it. But if you're looking for an expensive, flashy, studio-quality cinematic FPS, this is absolutely it. It'll make you pause and yell 'Are you serious? That's asinine', but you'll still laugh when someone gets hit with a car. I think it sums up 2014 pretty well, actually."

","People who like films like the Punisher, Taken, Man on Fire and similar films...films about men with bad destinies who go out to take their revenge...well people who like this kind of films will also like John Wick. The film is not really deep or something (compared to Taken or 96 Hours for example) but there's a lot of action and it's really entertaining. After Matrix I thought for a long time, that Reeves started to act in all his roles too cool, without a lot of mimics and gestures. As John Wick that would have been totally okay, because he plays a cold-blooded hit-man. But no, Reeves acts very well. I really had to laugh in the scene where Iosef, aka Alfie Allen aka Theon Greyjoy appears for the first time. In the same moment Wick puts the gas pump into the tank. I'm not sure if the directors have realized the hidden symbolic and the joke...but yeah, people who watch Game of Thrones will know what I'm talking about. It was funny."

","While this movie is definitely light on story and characters, there's no way you'd be watching this movie if that's what you were looking for. This is a fantastic action movie filled with perfectly choreographed violence and an epic soundtrack. The cinematography and color palette are what really kept me watching all the way through.

","John Wick, ruthless and frighteningly efficient assassin, retires to live in peace with his wife, a good woman: she dies 4 years later but, as her last act, has a puppy delivered to him so that he has company to grieve with. He is attacked in his own home by thugs, led by the son of his old boss (but who don't know who Wick is), who steal his car and kill the puppy. Wick comes out of retirement in order to exact retribution.<br/><br/>This Keanu Reeves vehicle is devastatingly simple, not to mention being as dumb as a box of rocks (there are at least 3 points where ruthless killers, having been non-stop ruthlessly killing for some little while, fail to ruthlessly kill the very person who they should immediately ruthlessly kill in order to prevent the subsequent bloodbath resulting from the not-ruthlessly killed person resuming their own ruthless killing. And don't get me started on the incredibly accurate shooting except at the person where it is dramatically important that they don't get shot).<br/><br/>But as well as being simple and dumb, it is also extremely stylish, often beautifully photographed, full of well choreographed action sequences, and quite good fun, not to mention being a very good vehicle for Reeves' minimalist, understated style of performance. If you're undemanding as regard illogicalities, plot holes and the like, you may well enjoy it as a straightforward violent action romp."

","What Keanu does best in this movie is kill people. The death rate must be huge.

I don't have to explain the plot as it's obvious if you've seen the trailer.Must remember to move to the area as there is not a cop in sight. It does what it says on the label but won't go down as a classic or one of his finest movies but there you go..can't argue with the box office that this will probably bring in.I gave it a 5 because of the direction of the action sequences,,,otherwise would have got a 4."

","Typically, revenge-action movies like this are easy to enjoy, even if the acting isn't that great. Keanu Reeves is NOT a good actor, and it shows big time in this movie. Unfortunately the other actors and the action were not enough to make it more than a decent movie. The story concept was good, and there were some cool ideas (like the neutral hotel), but other than that it was just OK.<br/><br/>The action scenes were very repetitive and predictable. How Keanu can hit everyone but his primary target with pin-point accuracy is a mystery. A few decent choreographed moments, but pretty cliché with nothing new to offer.<br/><br/>Could have been a much cooler movie with some minor adjustments."

","While John Wick can quite literally be described as an endless parade of bullets and headshots (seriously, Mr. Wick just loves a good old fashioned headshot!) Chad Stahelski's stylish, loud, brash and unwaveringly violent opus of revenge is a highly watchable stock standard tale of a scorned man on a warpath that we've seen before, yet never seen quite like this.<br/><br/>Front and center to this incredible body-dropping journey is dog lover and suit wearer John Wick, played by the thankfully watchable Keanu Reeves (almost like 47 Ronin was a bad dream). John is clearly a man who at one stage in his life utilized his skills of killing for a price and as per usual got out once love came his way. John is a man that even the ""bogeyman"" fears and a man who doesn't take kindly to having his puppy brutally murdered by a bunch of Russian thugs. The story of John Wick is slight and could've easily been written by a teenage boy whilst playing the latest Call of Duty but there's a market for these throwaway action flicks and up and coming director Stahelski clearly knows this.<br/><br/>Directing the film like it's been injected with a drip feed of Red Bull, Stahelski barely stops to breathe in amongst the processions of finely tuned and impeccably crafted gun fights. From a home invasion firefight, a nightclub massacre and rain soaked battle at a port, Wick finds himself literally fighting across New York in increasingly OTT yet sufficiently satisfying gun battles. Stahelski cares little for trying to be realistic and the films tone is almost comical in its treatment of hotels for hit men and ""waste disposal"" crews and you get the feeling this film was aiming to be more John Woo than James Bond, which gives it an added sprinkling of charisma even though we all know Keanu Reeves isn't exactly the poster boy of emotional embodiment.<br/><br/>If you don't like a liberal dosing of blood and a body count to match then John Wick is going to be a living, breathing nightmare for you, but for those looking for a well-oiled and at times almost fanciful rendition of the revenge tale then John Wick is going to be a new favourite of yours. A welcome return to form in many ways for Keanu Reeves and a calling card for director Stahelski, John Wick is under no illusions to what it is and neither should the viewer be when judging it. With a sequel already in the pipeline, it's pretty clear that John Wick did its job and hopefully can do it once more in the years to come.<br/><br/>3 pencils out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into -<br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","I don't understand all the praise that this movie is getting. This review is from old school action fan. First of all the story is plain dumb, way too unrealistic and without heart in it. We've seen a lot of one against army or gang movies, but this one is just too much. I don't get how some people can compare it to Taken. Keanu Reeves is the same like in any other movie: same face, same gestures, same talk. Although there is something attractive to Keanu when it comes to action movies, he is just mediocre actor. The movie is also dark and camera is shaky so it is hard to see who fights where and who shoots. I didn't see much blood or gore either. On the contrary it seems like many shots were toned down. The movie is very inconsistent. In some places there's a lot of blood when person is shot; in others there is no blood at all. The conversations between Russian gang is very stupid and childish. I can't ever imagine how gang can talk like that. I give it five stars but even that might be too much."

","If you're 13 or 14 years old and you absolutely adore violent video games, get your mom to take you to this picture and you will be in awesomeness heaven. If you're not, you'll probably want to steer clear of this ultra-violent and essentially nonsensical hit man revenge shoot-em-up. The body count surpasses most war movies — I lost count after the first 50 heavies had been dispatched in gorgeous squibs of blood and gore. The film requires a good deal of suspension of disbelief — for instance, there's a special hotel where hit men and women stay, paying in Krugerrands. There's also an exclusive club for hit men and women, where they can dance the night away as long as they respect the rules about not carrying out contracts on the premises. Keanu Reeves is better than usual as John Wick, the retired hit man who gets dragged back in, although i can't help feeling there is something sick about glorifying the talents of a hired killer. And there is a supporting cast of always-good character actors, including Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane, who add some grit and texture to what is otherwise a glossy and superficial fantasy of balletic violence. But getting back to the attractions for teen video gamers — there are some really cool cars in this movie too, and Keanu does this majorly cool thing where he drives real crazy and shoots people and runs them over.

John Wick is also not your ordinary man, he is a man of focus and sheer will and he is to be feared. And now he is a man setting his anger, revenge and grief upon those responsible.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves does what Keanu Reeves does when he is brought on for a role in a movie, and it is just right for the character of John Wick.

It also takes a look at the hit-man social circle and the honor code associated with the inner sanctum.<br/><br/>John Wick is the type of film that is so visceral in a fictional kind of way you can really only view it for entertainment purposes.

David Leitch and Chad Stahelski bring the quintessentially masculine fight scenes to life with extreme savagery for the ruthless and merciless hit man.

"estebangonzalez10","7","1","9","19 January 2015"," Keanu Reeves is back doing what he does best
","""People keep asking if I'm back and I haven't really had an answer, but yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.""<br/><br/>John Wick is as predictable and formulaic as the other 99% of revenge action flicks out there, but what makes this stand out is how well the action scenes are choreographed and what a breath of fresh air it is to see the action take place without all the extreme close ups and fast edits which never allow you to enjoy them. John Wick was directed by two former stunt men, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, who seem to have a grip at what they're doing because they don't take any of the fun away from the action scenes. Derek Solstad's screenplay is pretty straightforward. We are introduced to the main character, John, who is grieving over his recently dead wife. She leaves him a cute puppy which will help him during this grieving period, but a group of young Russian mobsters break into his home one night to steal his car and in the process they kill the dog. That brings John to his breaking point and we discover pretty soon that he is no common man. He was once a feared hit-man who later retired after meeting his wife. Now he is set on getting his revenge and the action begins. John is the typical hero we can route for and identify with for his loss, while the villains are ruthless and deserve to be punished. We've seen all this in almost every other revenge film, but what makes this one stand out and feel fresh is that the action scenes are stylized and energetic. So despite having a predictable plot you are entertained with some of the coolest action scenes of the year. This is no Raid 2, but it does get the job done. There is one particular action scene that takes place in a nightclub that is fantastically choreographed. These are the strongest moments of the film, but if you are looking for an original plot look elsewhere because this is very predictable. There are some interesting elements that Solstad introduces in this world where the mobsters have a series of codes and rues that they follow giving it sort of a video game vibe to it at times.<br/><br/>In order for the action scenes to work for a film like this where they aren't cutting the scenes every second you need to have an actor who can pull them off. They found the right one with Keanu Reeves who definitely knows his stuff. He delivers in every action scene with some fantastic choreographed moves. The mobsters build him up as someone they fear and respect, and once you see him in action you believe it. He also delivers during the quiet moments as well despite not having the best dialogue to work with. He was made for these roles and delivers. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Alfie Allen (from the Games of Thrones series) is getting typed cast as the hateful villain who behaves like a child at times. His father is played by the excellent Michael Nyqvist, who John Wick used to work for. He knows his kid made a mistake but tries to protect him nonetheless putting a generous reward on John's head. Willem Dafoe, Lance Reddick, and Adrianne Palicki get some screen time as well and they were a lot of fun. The way everyone treated John when they realized he was back in business was also another nice touch that the directors made and help lighten the mood at times. This was an extremely entertaining film with some of the best action scenes of the year despite all of its predictability. Stahelski and Leitch succeeded in making this predictable story feel fresh and if you are a fan of Keanu Reeve's work you will not want to miss this."
"curtisisasian","7","1","9","15 January 2015"," John Wick's pursuit of solace and other things
","John Wick is the tale of an angry Keanu Reeves hunting the men that supposedly took everything from him. <br/><br/>The film has a surprisingly strong start by relaying what happened to Mr. Wick to cause him so much distress. In a way it's a very clichéd story about a man seeking vengeance that has been done an uncountable number of times. However, when the action picks up it only slows down for cleanup(literally) and a little bit of exposition. One thing I will note is that this is probably Keanu Reeves's best performance in a long while(however you want to take that) he is actually capable of emoting for a few sparse moments throughout the film, but I digress. Unfortunately, he really can't carry the weight to make this an amazing film. This movie suffers from an often pretentious style that really tries to shove it in your face. The smooth, gentleman-like assassin world is interesting but when the film is done through and through you'll realize that there was so much potential wasted for the sake of clichéd theatrics and situations that were obviously contrived. The one thing that the creators did manage to do perfectly was the soundtrack, it always hit the ""badass"" note and felt appropriate. The fight scenes were mostly superb with Keanu moving swiftly like he dropped a few years, but a few(and trust me you'll know which ones) were way too ""hollywood"". <br/><br/>If you're looking for an enjoyable action flick that isn't overly thoughtful(which is what I was in the mood for when I watched it) I'd recommend John Wick<br/><br/>7/10-It's Average"

Directed by stunt men and first time directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch.<br/><br/>John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a retired and extremely dangerous assassin/hit-man, who leaves his 'fraction' so he can spend time with his wife. Until his wife Bridget Moynahan (I, Robot) unfortunately dies due to a terminal illness. When he is driving home from her funeral, he stumbles upon 2 Russians, who show a little too much interest in his car and his dog, a gift from his late wife. He is awoken late at night by his dog. As he goes downstairs to confront the noise. He is attacked by the same 2 Russians. They beat him and kill his dog. Now he doesn't like that, not, one, BIT.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is phenomenal, fast paced, and always keeps you on the edge of your seat. By far the best thing about it. On the other hand, the script is pretty darn ridiculous to say the least. coupled by the poor acting chops of Keanu. You'd think that after over 20 years of movies he'd be a little better at it by now. The acting from the Russians with the exception of Michael, is even worse. One redeeming factor of this is that, although the script is bad. The general plot and story unfolds well, which gradually makes the movie more fulfilling.<br/><br/>All in all, unlike most of the US action movies just being about a guy killing everyone and with a poor handled story and even worse script, John Wick only has one of those things. Thus making it more superior."

","5 Stars is a push for this one. I love Keanu Reeves don't get me wrong, but this film was just another shooty shooty bang bang, like so many out there. There wasn't anything special about the way John Wick fights or shoots, there was nothing set this one apart.<br/><br/>For a TL:DR summary of the film: <br/><br/>John wick is a (supposedly) legendary ex-hit-man who everyone is afraid of. The guy from game of thrones (that got raped and had his manhood cut off) comes round Wick's house and kills his dog and takes his car. John Wick gets annoyed, get's his guns from his secret hideout and goes hunting down the mob who killed his dog.<br/><br/>Also, the world that John Wick lives in is really unbelievable. Are we really expected to believe that there's this hotel specially built for hit men, who can come and be safe under some specific 'code'? It's crap. It's boring. The whole film is predictable.<br/><br/>Some people have been comparing this to the Equalizer, which is why I wanted to watch it in the first place. But the Equalizer is 100 times better. There is no comparison whatsoever. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this won't put me off Keanu, but it has made me realise that not every film he is in is gold. He's a bit hit and miss, and he really needs a good story and writing to come off well."

","I just saw the movie and liked it. I do not judge the script though. Great acting of most of the players, good handling of action scenes, and I think very good directors. But why the dog? Why did anyone think the dog could made sense and serve the purpose in the film? I mean, a former hit-man, a cold blooded killer, a guy who is supposed to have little empathy with life in general, decides to decimate his former employer's underground empire because the death of, after all, just a dog? I got the meaning of the dog, okay? But the significance attached to it is so complex, it is about an emotional transfer from dead wife to his peace of mind and soul, tantamount to philosophical levels of understanding! This in my view throws the very premise of the movie into sheer uncertainty to the viewers. Why couldn't be much simpler, such as in for instance In order of disappearance, where the guy's son is murdered. Let's imagine the following premise: wife shows up at the outset, is kind, beautiful, gets more substance, borrows the sports car for shopping, the same scene at the gas station and, suddenly, after she gets back home, a bunch of drunk Russians kill her accidentally with a baseball bat just to steal the car who they so very much liked, and all this with John not being at home. Even more, Viggo' s sun was supposed to know who John was, since he is the son of the boss right, but, and this would have gone just fine along the lines of the movie, he was stupid and drunk enough to forget about his name (which the wife had mentioned at the gas station while refusing to tag a price) - even after 5 years of John retirement, the son would still have been a dead man and provoked the kind of anger and disaster etc etc. what do you think?"

I think the audience have to send the message that lazy movie makers have to shape up. Is it really fun to watch this superhero of a hit-man shoot 450 enemies coming against him as fools?<br/><br/>Reeves makes a part that's dead serious and then you have Nyquists character thats more out of a comedy. It simply doesn't work out. <br/><br/>Then you have Dafoes Marcus that signs on for a contract and then doesn't shoot Wick when he get the chance. And he doesn't shoot the other hit-man coming at Wick either. It makes no sense.<br/><br/>These logical twists are just examples of details that ruins this movie.

","This is wholly forgettable, typical action and revenge, style as merely style.<br/><br/>The only way I can think of to describe it is this. An aging star or other has his agent fish around in the market for a script where he will have to look pained in spots, heroic in others. Liam Neeson seems to do this yearly. Denzel found a new franchise last year. Statham makes his living this way. There are probably any number of identical scripts floating around at any given time that fit the criteria, one is picked from an agency's hat or because it slightly stands out.<br/><br/>Someone is brought around to direct, a crew is assembled. Along the way a few spots open up for known actors to get a paycheck in return for a few minutes of screen time, a few of them here. Work is done, perhaps a hundred people go home with money to make mortgage, from set dressers to McShane. If decent enough, it makes up its money with some profit, viewers get their money's worth of gunplay. <br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with this, work is work, it's how anything gets done; it's that this particular one never convinces as anything other than what I just described, people dragging themselves out of bed to go to work, and this line of work has spoiled us to expect so much more than people simply doing it. When Dafoe talks with Reeves at a funeral within the first few minutes, that's not a conversation between characters who immerse themselves in the significance of some story, it's one actor standing where he was told to and repeating lines after the other has finished doing so."

","One would think that the overarching theme of this flick would be redemption by revenge, at least from most of the murmurs I heard during/after the screening, as well as read online. However, no one redeems themselves here. Someone who's stopped living, and is trying to deal with loss, is given a cruel jolt to get back to in terms of life, and ironically, that living is made possible by killing. <br/><br/>However, to quote an oft-repeated cliché, this time it's personal.<br/><br/>This is almost like a step-child of movies that are in on the joke of sending genres up (like 'Shoot 'em up'), that it is extremely entertaining since it is done right, just the way that Clive Owen vehicle was, but as serious as those movies that are not self-aware of the genre (more on that ahead in this piece).<br/><br/>Wick the character is so much in the shadows already by the time the movie begins, that one almost dreads it becoming a parody of itself, something that John Cusack or Nicolas Cage does, with bigger budgets and better (at least on paper) film-makers (Paul Schrader's making the latest Cage vehicle, that still might go DTV). To me, that is one of the major achievements of this particular flick - not succumbing to how easy it is to churn something out, and let it languish on a disc without making it cinema-worthy. First-time directors (one of them strangely uncredited) Chad Stahelski (listing those movies that seem to be close cousin of this one - stunt-work on Safe, Blitz, Faster, Ninja Assassin, Mr./Mrs. Smith, The Mechanic and Constantine - another reference for this coming up) and David Leitch (stunt-work on Ninja Assassin, The Bourne Legacy, Bangkok Dangerous, Mr./Mrs. Smith, The Mechanic, Constantine) make this genre their own, making us wish that they do more movies in this genre, in addition to quite possibly make a strong sequel, or series of sequels to this one.<br/><br/>So many are gonna walk out remembering Reeves and the stunts on this one, and they'd be right too, but this one also needs to be remembered for how great Michael Nyqvist is, and he has not got such a meaty role since his turn in the original girl with the dragon tattoo. He has as many scenes as Reeves does, and is a strong presence throughout, taking care not to chew up the scenery (and he sure can), and evoking great memories of his fantastic final mano-a- mano fight in the parking garage with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt in 'Mission Impossible: Ghost protocol'. The fights in this one are a companion piece to that particular encounter, strange though it may sound.<br/><br/>The always great gun-fu stunt-work is accompanied by impeccable production design, sumptuous cinematography and perfect metal soundtrack. <br/><br/>Both the helmers and their lead's work on 'Constantine' seems to have given them the license to borrow liberally from both the look and some of the concepts in 'Constantine' (concept of neutral 'hotel' ground for assassins in this one was borrowed heavily, even placing Lance Reddick and Ian McShane in Djimon Hounsou's shoes). <br/><br/>Speaking of comparisons, Adrianna Paclicki's assassin is as bad as Mireille Enos's assassin in 'Sabotage', and in a good way.<br/><br/>Every stunt sequence is minimalist, blunt and brutal, doesn't go on for longer than it has to, and respects every stunt-performer. Each performer who takes a hit, in our eyes, is seen to feel the hit, even an explosion. That way, we see the damage actual violence does, and this could also make a great case for why is should not be used as a resort (though I'm not sure most would feel that way). This is how each action scene, no matter what the movie, should be composed and (ha ha) executed, otherwise it has the danger for not allowing the impact or consequence, to be felt.<br/><br/>Look-wise, and action set-piece wise, this also has many things in common with both 'Payback' and 'Safe', and makes all of them look good, since the comparison is fair and complimentary. I still hold the other to be superior works, but this is high up there as well.<br/><br/>Willen Dafoe and Lance Reddick could've been given more to do, and McShane shines in the 2 scenes he gets. Alfie Allen plays another d!ck here, and people who hate him from 'GOT' will be allowed to regurgitate those emotions here.<br/><br/>In spite of the fact that the cuts to the gore and violence are minimal in the region I watched this in, the body that did said changes makes up for those omissions by posting a HUGE anti-smoking warning on screen, in bright white large CAPPED font (the movie's almost entirely dark, so you can imaging how we all had to squint during those sequences), that completely detracts from anything that might be happening on screen for the duration that any character lights up, or has a smoke in hand. Therefore, I will NOT recommend a local theatrical viewing, and instead suggest that this be viewed theatrically in regions that retain both the Rating as well as do not have on-screen diversions during its runtime.<br/><br/>One more thing - the prologue, and the loopback to it, were completely unnecessary narrative potholes, IMO, though the post-loopback was kinda relevant and gratifying."
"cbak223","5","1","17","23 November 2014"," John Wick 2?...
","John Wick 2, well, maybe. This film starts out very good, after being a fan of Keanu since I was 8 watching Bill & Teds at this stage of the game I love seeing Keanu and him being an assassin going by his name, I definitely have to see this. Well, although the film is very predictable it still made for a good ""check out"" action flick. Probably some of the best things about this movie was the cars, 70 chevelle, 69 mustang, and a very nice what I would suspect as to be a 2014 Charger, all very cool. After losing his wife, some ""punks"" decide to take his nice ride, and kill his dog, big mistake. It ends up how IRONIC it is that the kid that stole the car is the son of the guy he used to be in with in the ""killing business"". I title this as, John Wick 2?, because as this would and could be the set up for a nice sequel, because now the audience knows everything there is to John Wick, just how good of an assassin he is, how he got to where he is. I am wishing there was a little more of John Leguizamo's character because he is the car guy, the reason behind the mustang and chevelle. Overall Keanu did his thing, enjoyable from his acting stand point, there was good action but all the bullets and headshots don't get over the ""gimmicky"" side of it, story very basic, the odds that your car is stolen by your ex boss's son and even in the club I would say its safe to say he kills about 50 guys and it's like they all just run into his bullets or throw a few punches and then shot in the head, it would have been good for a slight plot twist or better ending, but if your a fan of Keanu & muscle cars give it a watch."
"scottshak_111","6","1","17","17 November 2014"," Overrated stuff, simply action can't uplift a movie
","Wick is sick. Go on, you can take the literal one here.<br/><br/>First things first, you don't kill the cutest beagle on the planet, that too a pup, in a movie! We are not yet ready for that! But if you do, which as a matter of fact, ‪Theon Greyjoy‬ did, just make sure it is avenged right. ‪Ramsay Bolton‬ are you listening? <br/><br/>Okay, so we already knew the plot thanks to the trailer that spoke louder than ‪Keanu Reeves‬. With thousands of clichéd stories of agents, mercenaries and hit men that are out there, Wick has nothing much to offer. Except one thing - rad action. Headshots, exquisite finishes, gore and Mustang engine revving are sheer orgasmic. But what it lacks big time is a proper storyline.<br/><br/>The direction is not that great either. We often see building shots of the city for like 5-7 times that are downright dispensable. Fight sequences were pretty cool though. Who are the directors again? Stuntmen? Okay. That explains it. What can we expect?<br/><br/>There is literally no drama present in the movie, and the entire movie carries a background beat that goes boom boom, which makes it an effort to concentrate on the dialogues dispersed. The score is well, trance, basically.<br/><br/>It is as if the directors thought - ""let's just build up a huge crowd of hooligans and let Keanu shoot them one by one from different angles, nay make him headshot each one of them, and there will be lots of blood spluttering, and let him drive something kewwwwwl too. While we are at it, let us give him a badass name. John Wick! Has a nice ring to it!""<br/><br/>Passable stuff. Watch only for the action."
"statuskuo","6","1","19","28 October 2014"," It's Okay
","Huh? (in response to the ratings/review) After watching the movie yesterday, I liked it. But the glowing reviews is going a little too far. The character of Wick stems from every western you've seen the past. Lone character whose purpose in life is activated by a terrible tragedy and is slung into action amongst other people similar to him. Yeah, westerns aren't made. This is the closest to it. And it's very effective. And silly at points. And it's fun and definitely worth the watch. I only wonder how terrible the movie industry has become that this will probably set a new ""gold standard.""<br/><br/>To be fair I felt the same way about ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" It's overblown hype, and wonder if some of the overwhelming positive reviews isn't coming from paid ""reviewers."" At best, this is a B-level 70's style revenge flick. A lot of bark, and some bite.<br/><br/>It's okay."
"burlesonjesse5","6","1","23","25 October 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of John Wick
","Liam Neeson has a special set of skills and now it appears that Keanu ""whoa"" Reeves has them too. So OK, picture this: guy loses wife to illness, guy gets dog as a present from dying wife, guy then gets beautiful Mustang stolen by Russian mobsters who beat said dog to death, guy who was once a professional killer, goes into vengeance mode by offing tons of paperweight Russkie heavies, and finally, guy gets visited by police officer (at his home) who asks him if he's working again, huh? That guy is John Wick of the movie John Wick and he's played by none other than thespian in hiding, Reeves. ""Wick"" clocks in as the fourth revenge/hit-man thriller to venture into theaters circa 2014. It lacks the startling epiphany of August's The November Man and the high caliber of acting from a certain Denzel Washington in The Equalizer. However, it's much more focused and assured than the totally discombobulated 3 Days to Kill (the weakest of the four).<br/><br/>For the most part, John Wick is a silly, ludicrous picture that doesn't really add anything new or reinvent the wheel via the revenge thriller genre. Its look is mirrorball glitter and glitz and its style is reminiscent of a Hong Kong action extravaganza (but with less ""Kong"" and tons of ""ganza""). This is a vehicle where Keanu's Wick dispatches so many bad guys you lose count within the first half hour. He does it with some impressive martial arts (much more polished and realistic than what he did in The Matrix) and guns that suggest laser tag, video game artistry, and Men In Black (I wasn't the only critic who picked up on this). As you watch John Wick, you don't condemn it, but you wonder how it didn't somehow land in the straight-to-DVD category. Basically, the whole point with this October release is that the filmmakers throw in scene after scene of non-stop death and destruction. It's to distract you from realizing how generic and tepid it is.<br/><br/>So OK, here are some things I pondered while viewing this bad boy with an undernourished 101 minute running time: 1. why doesn't anybody in this movie bother to wear a bulletproof vest? I mean Wick shoots a lot of his enemies in the chest. This might bring down the body count a little. 2. why does the antagonist (in this case, Viggo Tarasov played by Michael Nyqvist) not shoot the protagonist when he's defenseless and without weapon? You know he's gonna eventually get ya in the end if you let him live. Jeez! 3. do the lives of 50+ people have to end just because a dog died? I mean, I know the dog was Wick's last gift that reminded him of his dead wife but come on! He knew Daisy (dog's name) for one or two sequences, that's it. And yet, just about everyone that wasn't involved in Daisy's passing gets the death incarnate treatment. In general, I can't help but thinking that John Wick is trying to be a parody of your everyday vindictive, revenge fare. When Wick says the Russian gangsters took everything from him, I guess he left out the fact that he still has his beautiful home, expensive, tailor made suits, and plenty of discretionary wealth.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this thing is mildly mediocre but I found the lead role of a former, humblized contract killer to be a nice fit for Keanu Reeves. He's one of those actors that is better off saying the bare minimum of dialogue in order to get through a movie. His job here is to look cool, act cool, and basically exude a brooding screen presence. In his 42nd feature film, he pulls it off with veritable aplomb.<br/><br/>During the second half of John Wick, Keanu's title character says quote unquote, ""people keep asking if I'm back, yeah I'm thinking I'm back."" Not entirely Mr. cool breeze. But nice try though. You're getting there.<br/><br/>Of note: In terms of John Wick's stylistic voyeurism, look for a dance club scene where Reeves gets his kill-on Tom Cruise style (a la 2004's Collateral). Also, look for various subtitles in ""Wick"" that seem akin to the ones used in Tony Scott's Man on Fire (also from 2004). In the realm of casting, be on the lookout for three high profile actors who's roles are underdeveloped (with most of their scenes probably left on the cutting room floor). John Leguizamo plays a chop shop owner, Willem Dafoe plays a fellow hit-man and friend of Wick's character, and Bridget Moynahan plays Wick's character's wife. Oh and watch for the goofy guy from the Allstate commercials (Dean Winters, you know Mr. Mayhem) in a small role as the main villain's fruitful lackey."

","John Wick is the sort of film you only watch if you really like action movies... and I mean that you *really* have to like them. The choreography is great and really delivers that fantasy that John Wick is just an indestructible assassin.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that's about all the movie has to offer.<br/><br/>The plot is minimal, almost tacked-on. There is no character development. There is nothing this movie has to say. There is no intrigue, no drama, no comedy, no romance (thankfully). It's just one and a half hours of constant action choreography with a laughably weak ""video game"" plot. It like like watching someone play a video game. That may be your thing, but for me it wore very thin. By saying all that I almost feel like I've given away spoilers.<br/><br/>What makes John Wick most disappointing though, is that Keanu's been in better action movies, with better action scenes, and with philosophical themes and social commentary. Like... ""The Matrix""? Compared to that movie, John Wick is very weak indeed as a piece of cinema. I don't understand why people rate it highly - although it works as a piece of cathartic release, or something to watch for ""Netflix and chill"" - where the point of the movie is not to actually watch it."

Here, there's old school beat em up, Hong Kong kung fu inspired cinema back on the screen again. It's almost a throw back to 80s and before fight flicks in this way.<br/><br/>A simple revenge theme drives the film, and it suits Keanu's brooding persona well. The movie gets some decent acting chops from Alfie Allen and the late Michael Nyqvist, and a sly Willem Defoe, in fleshing out otherwise simply drawn and thinly written characters. Watch out also for a key character from 'The Wire' in a quietly scene stealing turn, whenever they're on screen.<br/><br/>If you're looking for docu drama, and high realism, then take a pass. if you put the brain on 'get this' mode though for an old school pop corn fight flick, John Wick is definitely an entertaining few hours."

You need only a slight push and a sledge of calculated revenge will go right down the track. Precise choreography of fights is absolutely amazing, you can feel the flow and all the skill set that John has developed throughout his career, but the age takes its toll, so you can see that humanizing rustiness. The gun wielding was incredibly entertaining, you could add it to the list of things you can watch forever, like fire and water.<br/><br/>Another interesting feature is that the Russian language was spoken pretty decently without the iconic Jason Bourne random letter stuff. I mention this because it boosts Keanu Reeves' dedication to the role, even a smallest detail is approaching perfection in hands of this guy.<br/><br/>Additional perks of the movie include an amazing soundtrack with Marilyn Manson's song ""Killing Strangers"" that immediately jumped into my playlist. Talking about a treat to your ears: voices of Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe as well as their on-screen presents are just a blessing.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a keeper.

","This movie is such an overwhelming film filled with so many exceptional action packed scenes that have insanely great choreography to match it. But at the same time the movie has spectacular dialog to help us understand why John Wick does what he does in this movie. Another fantastic thing in this movie is all the acting in this movie is just so perfect and acted out amazingly by every actor.
John Wick is about a legendary ex-assassin named John Wick (Keanu Reeves) who is brought back into the fold out of retirement from his violent career because some ruthless mobsters take away John's favorite car and kill the last present his wife gives him after she dies which is a puppy. But John releases the unforgiving killing machine inside himself and is out to get retribution for their actions. While at the same time the leader of the Russian mob named Virgo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) puts out a giant reward for John's head because he is trying to kill his son Losef Tarasov (Alfie Allen).
Directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch did a great job with this movie showing how they can make a really slick looking movie with superb action scenes but also create amazing dialog scenes to go with the movie. Both Stahelski and Leitch are veteran stuntman and in John Wick they really show how well they can direct a movie. Unlike Victor Armstrong who is also a veteran stuntman, he was great at being a stuntman but when it came to directing a movie it didn't go as great. Also I love how the directors are able to understand the whole action packed parts of the movie and just how wonderful they are to showing it. One of the only problems I have with the movie is the beginning and the ending to John Wick, it just seems so tacked on and could have been done better.
I would personally say that John Wick is one of Keanu Reeves best movie performances he's ever had to do, well all of the John Wick movies so far. But this is probably one of his best yet. John Wick requires so much out of Keanu Reeves from all of the stunt work he does to all of the emotional scenes. On a side note I would like to add that Keanu Reeves does almost all of his stunt work in John Wick so to get prepared for this movie he had to do a lot of extra training to get physically prepared for the movie. But I would personally say that it really paid off for Keanu Reeves to do the extra work.
In the trailer for this movie you see that some Russian mobsters kill his puppy and take his car and then he goes to seek revenge. I would say that in the movie it explains more into the reason why he goes seeking for vengeance and at first when you watch the trailer you're probably telling yourself how stupid of a reason that is to go on the bloody trail that he does in order for vengeance. But when you watch the movie from start to finish you start putting yourself into John's shoes and you are more understanding into why he does what he does.
Also when you watch the movie, you start to see how the writer (Derek kolstad) is kind of building the world that John Wick is in and how it helps set up for more John Wick sequels to be made and not seem forced on us. The writer creates this whole underground secret organisation of criminals. Unlike the movie series called The Maze Runner where at the end of the movie it just says and there's gonna be more movie. In John Wick it just builds the universe for more sequels to happen and it also shows the immense potential in the franchise.
John Wick is such a wonderful piece of work and I would recommend every action movie lover to see it. But also I believe that this movie would be great for almost anyone above the age of fifteen only because it is rated R. Also if you are a Keanu Reeves fan then I definitely believe you should see it due to his performance. But whatever you do when you see this movie don't view it for just the action. Take the whole movie all together."

That's one reason why this film became iconic in its genre.<br/><br/>3.5/5. Though the film was a fun watch, the shallowness of the story didn't make it memorable to me. A 4/5 on a good day."

"ronakkotian","8","0","1","31 December 2019"," Mindblowing action!
","Action films nowadays have been a joke. Aside from the Mission: Impossible series, there hasn't been one where the action makes you extremely excited or grip the edge of your seat. Luckily, we have John Wick to show us how action is really done.<br/><br/>John Wick is a hit-man who is in retirement but some gangsters take away everything he loves which forces him to come out of retirement and hunt them down.<br/><br/>John Wick has a very basic plot. It's a revenge story that's been done many times and hence why its story doesn't feel very innovative but what sells this film is the ACTION! As directors this is Chad Stahelski and David Leitch's first film and they've done an exceptional job. As both of them are stuntmen it's logical for them to know a lot about action and it's evident from this film that they do. Each sequence has a stylish flair present within them and each kill is different from the other which makes this movie so entertaining to watch. The choreography and camerawork is simply perfect. There are some long takes used during the action which increases the intensity of the scene and keeps your adrenaline flowing.<br/><br/>This film is filled with action which never ventures into boredom. This is largely due to the fantastic direction and extraordinary commitment by Keanu Reeves. After The Matrix, Keanu Reeves's career did go downhill. He needed something huge to bring him back into the Hollywood scene and John Wick did exactly that. Reeves is perfect for this role. He is the definition of awesome as he possesses this swagger that's present in each scene. His commitment to the action is praiseworthy. You can tell that he's doing most of the stunts rather than having a stuntman to do it for him. It conveys to us how much he cared about this film.<br/><br/>Whilst the story is very predictable, the film does do a great job of showing us who John Wick is. Throughout the movie we learn how powerful this man was in the underworld before his retirement. We see how many people are associated with him and the film repeatedly shows how fearful people are towards him which portrays how unstoppable John Wick is.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick is one of the best action films made. The USP of this movie is its action and there is plently scattered across this movie. Keanu Reeves does a fantastic job as John Wick and I praise his dedication towards the film's stunts. If you want to have an exhilarating experience for 1 hour and 40 minutes then John Wick is the film for you."
"MovieFan095","9","0","1","16 December 2019"," A Really Awesome Action Flick
","John Wick is one of Keanu Reeves' best movies. It has tons of high-scaled action, one heck of a plot, and runs in a fast and steady pace for 100 minutes.<br/><br/>Thi movie is about a man, John Wick (played by Reeves), who retired from being an assassin after the death of his wife. A savage mobster and his thugs then steal Wick's priceless car and kill his puppy. So now, it's time for Wick to seek vengeance and kill the people that screwed him over.<br/><br/>I would say this is also a perfect example of a revenge flick. Similar to Kill Bill, the protagonist must get back at the person for killing something of theirs.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" has a lot of great action scenes. It has enough to satisfy an audience to where they are speechless.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Keanu had one hell of a performance in this and he knew what he had to do in order for this movie to be action packed. All the other cast members did a really good job as well.<br/><br/>The one thing I do not like about this film is when the puppy dies. That scene was so hard to watch and makes you want to cry because you feel bad for him. But thankfully, Wick manages to get back at the bad guys for doing that.<br/><br/>All in all, John Wick is outstanding, and is one of the best movies of 2014. Highly recommend it.<br/><br/>It is my 3rd favorite movie of 2014 after ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", and ""Interstellar""."

","It's cheesy, formulaic, and hammily acted. It's also stylish, high energy, and generally just a fun popcorn movie.<br/><br/>""John Wick"" is a retired hitman who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here, but if you're squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we've heard this story dozens of times.<br/><br/>What's different is the world in which this takes place. There's a secret criminal underground that seems to have their hands in everything, and there's a specific code and honor among thieves. Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn't involved or in the know somehow, so it's implied that this society is very widespread and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common with the ""Wanted"" comic book than the ""Wanted"" movie did.<br/><br/>Part of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick is that he isn't a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo, he's not invincible. He's simply very well trained and determined, which makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know the outcome, there's always this little part in the back of your mind that wonders if he'll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic. Let's be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn't have much practical value in the real world.<br/><br/>Given the implications for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane's Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as ""Jonathan"" even though the name is John; different spelling means it isn't a shortened version of his name) to Lance Reddick's hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there's a lot of ground to explore. It's not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies."

","I'll be honest if someone were to kill my dog I'd probably go insane, but John Wick is able to take this concept of loss, and make it into an amazing action movie all about revenge. The villains are these cold blooded killers and you hope John gets his revenge.

","The basic premise of this movie is that Wick is a retired assassin on a revenge rampage. We're supposed to empathise with a man who was and is a ruthless, amoral killer whose former employer included a Russian mafia boss.<br/><br/>Then we're supposed to believe that this man is so well known that the entire city knows him, yet he lives alone in a literal glass house with zero security.<br/><br/>The local town has an assassin's hotel and hangout big enough to house the population of Yankee Stadium, and luxurious enough to have the budget of a small country. And this is not played for laughs or weirdness - it's just a thing.<br/><br/>The assassin himself roller coasters between supposed awesome displays of lethal skill, and breathtaking, showboating ineptitude, such as simply getting back into the vehicle that was stolen from him and returned, without checking if it's bugged or booby trapped, recovering from his failed hit in a hotel known for homing assassins without drawing the curtains or securing the door, or taking on the boss and his most deadly henchmen in a carpark without remotely securing the area.<br/><br/>The number of times Wick just blasely strolled, without so much as a pair of sunglasses or a cap to disguise his identity, into situations with dozens of trained killers waiting for him was downright insulting.<br/><br/>The gunplay was stupidly showy, the martial arts was stupidly ineffective and flashy, and every actual hand to hand fight was in the dark.<br/><br/>I liked the movie at the time but hated it in retrospect. Every scene was a massive insult to my intelligence. It lacked the comic book hyper reality of Sin City yet it was far too silly to consider as a serious attempt at the genre. Fal, fail, fail."

","John Wick (2014) is a typical action movie about a man taking revenge. The movie started with John Wick get out from a car while badly injured, then the screen goes black and showing him at his wife funeral. At the first 20 minutes of the movie, it's showing us about the daily life of a no one man named John Wick and how his dog killed and how his car get robbed too.<br/><br/>
But after that 20 minutes running time, the movie started to show us about how badass he is and horrible his job world before. its turn out that John Wick was an ex-legendary hit-man that retired after his marriage. Even the car robber father who's was one of his old clients afraid of him so much and tell us how dangerous John Wick was that he killed 3 armed men just with a pencil. Then after that, the movie continues with John Wick shoots people in the face until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>
As far as I know, John Wick is the best action movie series. This movie is just filled with pure action, there was never a dull moment happened. There is no pointless long dialogue that makes action sequence to sequence felt confusing. Every action sequence in this movie is amazingly executed, you will never have trouble to understand what happened in front of you. All you need to do is sit tight and enjoy the movie."

Surely if she was killed, he'd be more concerned with avenging her than his car and the dog he had for 2 days? Might as well have written him as a bachelor.<br/><br/>The policeman turns up at his door after he kills 12 men in his house, the police officer sees the bodies and the blood on his face, but it's okay because he's John Wick.<br/><br/>Supposedly, he's the top hit man but we don't see him working, just getting revenge."

","If there's a modern movie that better exemplifies the 80s action movie, I don't think I've come across it. The plot doesn't really have twists, and there are basically no subplots to speak of; it's just a straight line from beginning to finish. Reeves plays the titular retired hitman who's just lost his wife (to cancer) but who receives a beagle as a final present from her, delivered after her death. He has the dog for like two days before Russian mobsters invade his house to steal his vintage Mustang and kill the dog just for kicks. And thus the most plausible revenge plot in history is set into motion. There's a LOT of violence. A lot of characters die. Some of the action is very reminiscent of The Matrix. The weaponry is impressive, as is the hand-to-hand combat. There's a lot to love about John Wick the movie, as long as you're part of the intended audience, i.e., the action-movie fan."

I especially liked the hotel for Villains storyline, which I believe they may be turning into a TV series. A really good watch. I only had one real gripe. Reeves is wronged at the start of the movie by three/four Russian Mafia but then goes on a rampage where he quite easily slaughters hundreds without breaking a sweat. Surely these few hoods at the start could not take out such a seasoned assassin. Then again it is Hollywood and without it we would not have a movie so will let it slide.

","The new franchise to boost Keanu Reeves acting career, is certainly gonna go down as the best action movie of 2014! It has a great cast with very serious and grim performances, while still being charming and intimidating. <br/><br/>The film starts off with a very generic plot - ""mans wife dies, leaves a dog - home-invaders kills dog and steals car, man sets out to avenge the crimes."". 
Even though it had me bored for the first 10 minutes of plot-building, I got so immersed as soon as the action and dialogue started popping. The cinematography and style is so beautiful and different from other action films, which makes it a unique and fresh breath into the genre. The film is also filled with stunning performances from Reeves and the compelling antagonist - even a surprise performance from Willem Dafoe. <br/><br/>One thing I noticed during the action, is the fact that the kamera-work has shy completely away from ""shaky-cam"", which is much harder to achieve and so pleasant to look at. It makes the action more tangible and easy to follow. <br/><br/>Even though the plot is not really a new thing, it's unveiled and structured with such grace, that the only critique - is the simplicity of it all. But overall a really satisfying action-flick, that clearly blew me away."

"neazy","6","0","1","26 November 2017"," Not quite there
","The simplicity of this film is attractive. Straightforward characters, motivations and storytelling. It doesn't get hung up on unnecessary backstory or fleshing out characters beyond what they need to be. For an all-out action film, this is a good and refreshingly honest choice - it maintains the pace, makes the transitions through the story slick, and allows you to sit back and enjoy it. It is also a risky tactic, because the lack of depth demands that every element of the film be tight and foolproof. It nearly pulls it off - the performances, which have to drive the narrative and create the energy in the absence of detail - are all excellent, and the leads very well cast. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film seems to chicken out at certain crucial moments, falling back on tired tropes to manufacture tension. Wick makes one or two decisions which do not fit in with the limited picture we have of him, and therefore feel incongruous. There's a clumsy 'kill everyone except the woman and then regret it later' cliché. Most disappointing is the age-old 'antagonist walks away leaving henchmen to kill hero' trope, which feels utterly stupid and out of place in a world constructed as deliberately ruthless. Viggo is supposed to understand the situation and the man he is up against. He knows his ability to escape impossible situations, and he knows how many times his own men have failed. He has no affection for John, and he wants him dead, but he leaves his armed henchmen alone in the room to suffocate him with a plastic bag!? This ruins the whole atmosphere and aesthetic of the film.<br/><br/>Despite these disappointing moments, this has enough to it to make it a worthwhile watch. An honest action flick is one to be praised."
"bregund","5","0","1","23 November 2017"," Video game violence with some Charles Bronson thrown in
","This film is nothing more than a reimagining of those old movies from the 70s where some evil people kill a guy's wife/family/dog/whatever and he goes on a bloody vendetta. The Outlaw Josey Wales comes to mind, or basically any Charles Bronson film, with a touch of Taken and The Usual Suspects thrown in. There is no time to get to know any of the characters, they have zero depth, which is fitting since Keanu Reeves lacks the ability to portray three-dimensional characters. As the body count piles up, Willem Dafoe's character drifts in here and there, but he isn't given much to do except look pensive and drift away again. This is the perfect film to watch if you just want to zone out and not think very much, there are no challenging ideas for you to struggle with, just lots and lots of stabbings, shootings, and head-bashings. It must have been incredibly easy to write the script for this film."

Although the subject matter is dark and sad, I think that the audience loves him because his anger is intense and his quick action is bold and beautiful. Interesting point is that he is known well to people around. Everybody knows his ability to fight. He is wonderful killer. The audience can see the story from his angle, so they are able to feel as if they were really super strong. Anyone will come to like him.

","For the people rating this film low, quite frankly I find your lack of taste and intelligence disturbing as your narcissistic view of other people like me who adore this silly yet badass film about vengeance. Nevertheless there is little I have to complain about this film.NOW SPOILERS AHEAD! I think it simply a near perfect film about how a oddly relatable super assassin who is just grieving the loss of his wife and just wants to be left alone and have some semblance of peace in his life but some punks who think they are just the coolest guys ever come in and break into his home kill his dog and foolishly because they are typical foolish thugs leave the man alive... from the beginning of the film up to that point you are 120% on John Wick's side as he effortlessly just dispatches men like they are ants with the mob boss running scared doing everything he can think of to keep the legendary Baba Yaga from slaughtering him and his entire family and his entire syndicate even attempting to hire a man that could have possibly picked off John Wick but ultimately betrays his own mob boss client in favor of John at the cost of his life. I really don't have much bad to say about this film other than it is admittingly silly and over the top but that is also what makes it so charming and fantastic and the film even is aware that it is silly but yet it's entertaining from beginning to the very end.

","On paper, this film looks like a typical action film. However the things that set this film apart is the stylishness of the film and the incredible world it creates<br/><br/>First of all, Keanu Reeves shows he still has what it takes to be a successful actor. He gives a multi layered performance as Mr Wick, and makes you fear this fictional character, and after watching the film i am thankful. One thing that adds to the film is that Reeves did that majority of his own stunts, this makes the action feel more fluid and the man even more bad-ass. After seeing Reeves in this film, i could imagine no one else in the role. <br/><br/>The films strongest trait, is the fight sequences. Once the action starts, it never seems to stop. The fights are brilliantly choreographed and they seem realistic and brutal. The mixture of martial arts the character uses shows real skill, and adds to the realistic feel of the film and world created. John Wick proves himself capable of killing with both hands and firearm. If you're a fan of brilliant action sequences, then this is the film for you.<br/><br/>The only criticism of the film is the plot. Although the story brilliantly creates a world of assassins, the plot itself is nothing new and has been seen before, however despite this i was left satisfied that i had not seen an action film like it.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick left me wanting more and is a real treat for action fans and Keanu fans. Bring on John Wick Chapter 2."
"bowmanblue","6","0","2","1 July 2017"," Mindless action fun
","I think I'm a little late to the party on this one and I guess it must have cost me. I'm an action-movie fan. I grew up in the Arnie/Sly era of the eighties and I have plenty of mindless action flicks in my DVD collection – everything from 'Commando' to the mode recent 'Shoot 'em Up' pleases me to a degree and Keanu Reeves pops up a fair times in my watchlist. However, somehow his film where he plays the titular 'John Wick' slipped past me. I've only just seen it after its sequel was released and, during that time, I've seen many a positive review saying how great it was. Therefore, by the time I got round to watching it, my hopes were high.<br/><br/>I guess what happened is the reverse of when I watched 'Sex Tape' and the big screen adaptation of 'The Dukes of Hazzard.' Both had been absolutely slated by the critics so my expectations were suitably lowered by the time I saw them. And, weirdly enough, I actually took some small amount of entertainment in both! I'm not saying either were particularly good, but enjoyable enough if you were in the right mood. This time, my hopes were so high, I found that what I got didn't really live up to what I was expecting. I was waiting for something truly revolutionary and different from anything I'd seen before. What I got felt like just another action movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong – it's not bad. It was enjoyable enough, but it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. John Wick is a retired hit-man who's forced out of retirement when a baddie (played by 'Game of Throne's' Alfie Allen) kills his dog. Yes, that's basically the catalyst and motivation for the entire film. What follows is your average (and I deliberately use the word 'average') roller-coaster of violence and revenge. Everything you'd expect is there: gunfights are plentiful, there's at least one car chase, a betrayal and eventually Wick comes face to face with the evil head honcho. So it's all there. And it's well done. The violence (and there is violence – no PG13 here!) is believable and gritty and Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch (even when he's trying to be moody and miserable he's still that long-haired 'bogus' surfer-dude we all fell in love with back in the early nineties). So, I can see how there's much going for it. I was just expecting more. And that's a shame really because my hopes were so high that, even though everything I like was – technically – there, I still came away with the feeling like it wasn't that much of a big deal. But, like I said earlier, a sequel has been made and I will definitely watch that, too.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this film may not have entirely clicked with me, but I'm glad that Keanu Reeves is back in a decent franchise and it puts him back in the spotlight – maybe John Wick can team up with Liam Neeson in a Wick/Taken crossover? ;o)"

I understand the the movie is meant to be an action movie for having fun time, but sometimes the story is so bad that I felt uncomfortable on my coach.<br/><br/>One interesting fact. There seems to be a cinematographic novelty in this film with regard to fights: The full scale mixture of martial arts and gun fight. This was what I was long waiting for, because in reality this is what will happen if we have a well-trained hit man. Good job!"

The action sequences flow beautifully in their cartoonish brutality, but the film falls short in the execution of the script. A story this silly should not take itself so seriously, if only they had more fun with the ludicrous plot and dialogue. I mean, you've got the mayhem guy from the Allstate insurance commercials playing a bad-guy executive secretary, surely that's good for a joke somewhere?

In some places the effects were easily noticeable (sometimes terrible). And last but not least the move felt cheesy, it felt like they try to paint this super powerful image of the main character (just like internet does with Chuck Norris).<br/><br/>Now with the good points: as I mentioned half of the cast was pretty bad, but Keanu Reeves was really good, I also liked Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo Daniel Bernhardt and Clarke Peters. Some of them had so little screen time, but when they did, it felt so refreshing to see an interesting character after the sea of average. And obviously the most important thing is the stunts: a lot of the time they were impressive and kept me on my toes.<br/><br/>All in all, John Wick is a pretty good action movie.

Keanu done well in the Matrix but as for action films he just doesn't fit that part especially a film like John Wick where he is the top assassin.<br/><br/>So after watching the film I see it is exactly what anyone would expect to see, the story was good and the acting was fair.

That's not meant to be a put down, I enjoy these flicks myself when I'm in the right frame of mind, but I don't pretend they're anything more than over the top, shoot 'em up action as they go for the proverbial gusto. I must have lost track of Keanu Reeves' career there for a while because I never would have considered him to be the kind of action hero the picture calls for here at the age of fifty. The role calls for a fair amount of athleticism and Reeves pulls out all the stops. Sometimes if I'm alert enough I'll start taking a body count when the carnage begins but with this one I got distracted by the waste disposal crew accepting their dinner reservations. Setting the torch to Viggo's (Michael Nyqvist) private stash was the icing on the cake for this viewer, drawing me to the conclusion that the Russian mobster would have been a whole lot better off offering the four million dollars to John Wick to just go away."

","I have to make a confession before getting into this movie - I normally can't stand Keanu Reeves. Apart from playing a likable goofball in the ""Bill & Ted"" films and an okay performance in ""The Matrix"", I don't think he's a particularly good actor. Which is the main reason why I avoided this movie when it played in theaters. I decided to give it a look after hearing several positive reviews of it and after finding a copy I could check out for free from my local library.<br/><br/>After watching it, I am glad that I took a chance. For starters, Reeves gives an adequate performance. It certainly helps that he doesn't have a huge amount of dialogue, but what he is given he does deliver acceptably. However, he does a bravo job when it comes to the physical part of the role - he throws himself into the action, coming across both as a spectacular skilled foe while at the same time not coming across as outlandishly fancy - I could believe a man could be skilled enough to do everything he did. (It also helps that he gets wounded and hurt along the way, which prevents him from becoming unbelievably and annoyingly perfect.) <br/><br/>While I'm on the subject of action, kudos has to also go to director Chad Stahelsk for staging it successfully again and again. The gun fights and martial arts are spectacular. Praise has to also go to him for keeping the movie moving speedily along without any boring bits despite there not being a terrible amount of plot... and for the fact that the little plot there is will be familiar to many viewers.<br/><br/>I see they are making a sequel to this movie.

","John Wick is a dark and explosive action hit! Now before you commit to watching this movie you must be in the mood for over-the-top, unrealistic, action violence . If that is what you are looking for then John Wick provides in every area. The movie revolves around a retired hit-man who recently dropped out of the game to stay at home with his wife. After a series of unsettling events John is thrown back into the world of underground mobsters and assassins as he seeks revenge against the men who took all he had left. The story is not great but provides enough sway to convince you to cheer for Wick throughout the movie as he kills dozens of Russian mobsters. Keanu Reeves performance is sub-par as his character rarely speaks and shows little to no emotion, but since he is a world class assassin this may fit his character perfectly. The fight scenes are entertaining and the hand-hand combat competes with that of the Bourne series, but the story is not as compelling and also not as confusing.Overall John Wick is a satisfying action movie, but don't watch it for anything but a good time."

Reeves plays John Wick, the deadliest hit-man ever, that just so happens to be retired because he fell in love. Well, his wife died and left him a puppy. He encounters some punk Russian kid that wants his ride. Later the kid shows up, takes the ride, kills the dog, and beats up John. Well, he messed with the wrong guy. It just so happens the kid's mob dad was the guy John used to work for and now he wants revenge.<br/><br/>What's cool in the movie is the whole hit-man code speech, the Continental hotel (where one doesn't do business), paying with these gold coins, and making a dinner reservation. The ending is where the film falls apart and just becomes another action flick with the ""hero"" out to get the final bad guy.

Sadly, if the two movies above were filled not only with... extremely brilliant scenes for the technology of the time, but also quite deep and meaningful plot - John Wick seems to be a pretty one-sided coin.<br/><br/>He lost his dearly beloved, he got mugged, that's all the premise you need. Though I do admit that Viggo's exposition was impressive, some background would be nice.<br/><br/>Granted all the plot unravellings, I don't understand why would he hang up Viggo's call. Both John and Viggo know better, and instead of going on some mad rampage, a simpler fate could've been arranged. Much simpler. Or it could end the same, but it would at least look plausible.<br/><br/>Red Circle encounter is laughable. Beautiful, obviously, until he stares at his desired victim and just lets him run away. I first thought he wants the usual: suffering, torture etc. But apparently he never needed it, so why not end the movie halfway through if there was a chance?<br/><br/>All the side characters are merely plot devices. Female assassin? Has to explain what the management was. Marcus? Deus ex machina.<br/><br/>Yosef's death could probably only rival Talia Al'ghoul's. Home siege, Red Circle, Car scene... all these great performances, yet the very antagonist of this movie was supposed to be hidden in impenetrable fortress, but... Snipe here, snipe there, done. Seriously?<br/><br/>The list can continue, but the point is that very often the suspension of disbelief is raised, even if you really want to keep it.<br/><br/>And, of course, I can't help but stand in line with every Russian who was severely offended by this movie. Now, I know that between Italian and Russian mafia - these nations shouldn't really be surprised when their people are slaughtered, and I would never imagine that Hollywood would ever get Russian actors. But that song? The lullaby? I know russians are a sick nation firsthand, but not even the craziest of us would sing a ""lullaby"" in a nightclub in a bath with half naked women.<br/><br/>I feel that giving the movie 7\10 is a very generous gift. If not for Wick and Viggo's performance - 5\10 would've been the right place. Aka - a movie that really isn't remotely good, but is at least worth looking for the some thrills.

"MeanYOB64","Null","0","4","1 May 2015"," Wick Equalized
","I suppose for me the idea of John Wick was something like 'Falling Down' but without the social comments and instead of an ordinary guy pushed over the edge, here the protagonist is a retired hit-man. <br/><br/>Needless to say, the entire plot is adequately summed up in the trailer and if you like movies that set out to entertain in a simple way, the comic book logic and emphasis on stunts and action here will be right up your alley. From my viewpoint, I hesitate to say Reeves carries this movie to a certain extent, but I don't want to take too much away from the rest of the cast, though some like Palicki aren't given much of a chance to demonstrate their full range of talents or have a strong impact on the proceedings for lack of time on screen. Nyqvist gives an interesting performance but is fighting against a particularly weak script even by action movie standards, and his Russian Mob Boss character often comes off as somewhat of an imbecile, even if there are deliberate attempts at humor peppered in.<br/><br/>Overall, Reeves is appealing and inherently sympathetic with a sombre low-key performance sort of reminiscent of what he did in 'The Watcher'. Notably his physical work with regards to the action is commendable, but in my opinion it is a shame it was not applied to a movie with a slightly stronger script and direction, when compared with a movie that strives for similar goals like 'The Equalizer' which lacked those deficiencies and made for a more well- rounded and engaging viewing experience. <br/><br/>Worth watching, could of been better, so <br/><br/>** out of ****"

","Under normal circumstances I wouldn't have seen John Wick. I'm not a big fan of action thrillers and Keanu Reeves hasn't been my favourite actor either. The selection of movies was pretty limited at the theatres, so decided to give John Wick a chance.<br/><br/>Have to confess that I was pleasantly surprised by the film and enjoyed it much more than expected. In particular Keanu Reeves as John Wick was very good. In the past the only roles that he ever looked comfortable and appropriate in were the characters who looked somewhat bewildered about what was going on. The first Matrix film in particular played to his strengths whereas the follow ups didn't convince as he was supposed to be a stronger character. There is no doubt that he pulls this off in John Wick, so will not be quite as snooty about Keanu in the future! The film itself is quite stylish and somewhat similar to Sin City in terms of style. Personally I found the on screen comments quite annoying, but the film is reasonably written in terms of screenplay. If you are a fan of action thrillers and/or Keanu Reeves I'm quite sure you'll really enjoy this movie."

","A retired hit-man gives up his criminal lifestyle due to personal tragedy . When the Russian mob steal his car and kill his puppy he decides to go in a revenge mission <br/><br/>And that's that as far as inciting incident and plot line goes in this modern film noir/action thriller . Despite having a painfully over familiar story that you've seen countless times JOHN WICK is far more thoroughly enjoyable than it has any right to be . The fact that it stars Keanu Reeves as Keanu Reeves action hero should put you or any other rational intelligent off the film but he's actually quite good in this . Okay he's basically choreographing all the same moves as he learned in THE MATRIX but thankfully Reeves doesn't have to do much involving the skill of acting - why break the habit of a life time ? - but as a no holds barred enjoyably mean thriller with its tongue firmly in cheek "" Sorry to disturb you Mister Wick but we've had a complaint about the noise"" it's very entertaining . If you want to find out how this movie could have been check out the horrible mess that is SMOKIN' ACES which has a not too dissimilar plot"
"guido-lomanto","4","0","5","18 March 2015"," Aesthetically beaufitul but an overall clumsy movie
","I do not understand why this movie has that many good reviews. Sure, it has some good things going for it (choreography, some characters, nice action scenes, interesting places) but that's it. The whole plot (especially the first 20 minutes) happens too fast for the audience to even feel some sympathy for Wick. Dialogs are clumsy, some situations are ridiculous (and i do not mean the fight scenes, those i can cope with), the flow is just...weird. Oh and LOTS of clichés, really predictable characters with no real personality, everyone is kinda hollow and simple. I don't know, maybe it was not supposed to be taken seriously but it sure does not feel like a light hearted action film."
"TxMike","Null","0","9","28 February 2015"," Far too much cheap, point-blank killing for this to be a really good movie.
","OK, I know it is a movie, a complete work of fiction, I know actors didn't really die. But this kind of movie glorifies point-blank execution killing justified because the guys being killed work for a Russian mafia in New York. But it still cheapens life and we simply have too much of that in our movies.<br/><br/>In general I like Keanu Reeves and I like his character here, John Wick, who formerly worked as a hit man for the same Russian gang that he has to turn against. He had successfully gotten out, ""retired"", and had a life with his loving wife. But she had a terminal illness and she died. <br/><br/>Still in grief, he gets a delivery at home, it is a cute puppy that his wife had arranged to be delivered right after her death, so he would have a companion and he could remember her.<br/><br/>Stopped for gasoline in his beautiful 1969 Mustang, puppy in the front seat, a guy walks up and asks ""How much?"" Shocked Wick simply says it is not for sale. The man says something rude in Russian then is shocked when Wick answers him, in Russian. <br/><br/>That night the dog alerts and Wick gets up to find three men in his house, they must have looked up his address from the Mustang's license plate. They beat him mercilessly, killed his dog, and stole his Mustang. (Sounds like an old western movie, doesn't it?) <br/><br/>Well this ""guy"" is the frivolous son of the Russian gang leader, and when the dad, Michael Nyqvist as Viggo Tarasov, finds out his son stole John Wick's car, and killed his dog, he knew Wick would hunt all of them down. Which is what he does, and that is mostly what the movie is about.<br/><br/>The other good role is Willem Dafoe as fellow hit-man Marcus, who appears to accept a $4 Million job to kill John Wick, but instead he ends up helping him.<br/><br/>This is just a plain shoot and kill revenge movie, and it could have been so much better but I suppose this is what appeals to movie- goers nowadays."

Obligatory stash of weapons and money sealed under concrete floor. Old friend who appears to have turned on our hero but saves his bacon at a couple of crucial moments. Climactic fight with the main bad guy in which they toss aside their guns and fight hand to hand.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>That wrong done to him? Killing his dog and stealing his car. Seriously? I get the sentiment behind the dog and his dead wife and all, but still I was reminded of the bit in Last Action Hero about how they killed his favorite second cousin or whatever.</li></ul><br/><br/>If this was the first movie you'd ever seen in this genre, it would be totally amazing. As it is, I kept seeing a lot of things I'd seen before and not enough things that I hadn't.

"tbills2","6","0","8","23 February 2015"," John Wick - Best Video Game Ever???
","John Wick is an awesome video game and one of the best third-person shooters I've ever played with incredible groundbreaking graphics, a handsome lead character to control in John Wick, and a more clever story premise than you might realize. What's that? John Wick is a movie? John Wick is a movie. John Wick, is a movie. That explains why I was so good. No wonder. John Wick has a video game plot, video game action, a video game reality, a video game mentality, video game art, lighting and text, and a bunch of random dudes popping out out of nowhere getting shot one by one like they're in some video game or something. Keanu Reeves kicks serious ass as John Wick and I laugh at the thought of people who don't think he's a good actor. Reeves is John Wick. Keanu Reeves is really cool. John Wick is really uncool. I love puppies as much as the next guy but not as much as John Wick apparently. John Wick's 75 man kill count speaks volumes. John Wick has a genius story premise with well choreographed and very well shot stylish action that is fun but not that suspenseful. John Wick almost has too much pointless violence but they did mess with his puppy and it is such a pure action film."
"radhrh","7","0","2","22 February 2015"," Slick shoot em up with stylish visuals but anorexic plot.
","Of its genre, a quite entertaining if ultimately absurd way to spend a couple of hours of your life. Other posters have gone into the plot discrepancies before and considering there isn't really what you could call a plot then these are major flaws. The only slightly interesting plot element is the Continental hotel, a hotel for hit men (and hitwomen) where psychopathic killers can be assured a good nights sleep without fear of being attacked by other psychopathic killers. Perhaps there is a hole in the market for that sort of thing....<br/><br/>But if you are able to overlook the films flaws you will find much to like here. It is slickly and stylishly shot, the action sequences( of which there are many )are well paced and choreographed in a style which borrows heavily from MMA, its has a strong supporting cast and even Keanu Reeves looks convincing.<br/><br/>There is a time and a place for this sort of film and it does what it sets out to do with a degree of flair, and I for one wouldn't mind seeing more of John Wick."

","Totally insane movie with awesome fights. Keanu delivers a terrific performance. The story line is very weak. But the characterization of the hero is Stunning. The other characters have limited screen space. Full credits to the stunt master. John Wick is a killer, ghost man, he can kill three men armed only with a pencil, but somehow manages to overlook a couple of brainless thugs hack into his house, lets them beat the crap out of himself, kill his dog and steal his car. John Wick is so famous that even the policeman, the bartenders, the mafia, all the town know him, but the son of a mafia boss for some reason does not even hear about him! The funniest thing in the movie is The hero kills hundreds of gangsters, the mafia boss and his son just for a stupid dog. This movie should have been titled ""A man rises for a Dog""."

","The first 30 minutes is very The Equalizer. I was thinking give up on it, the policeman scene after the home fight changed my mind and scenes like this one actually is the entertaining part of the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not the fan of the story so when the police showed up, I thought John is about to be hunted by both gang and police which is a sign of ""you can spend your night better than this"".<br/><br/>No, the conversation between John and policeman Jimmy change the tune of the whole story.<br/><br/>Legendary hit-man John Wick is a famous hit-man, a fair hit-man, a man whose reputation is so good even police don't want to bother him. Everyone in the business knows him and almost everyone respected him. <br/><br/>With this idea in mind, the story makes a little sense now. The ridiculous decision that let the gang boss go and killed his son is because his fairness. John's business is always with the dog-killing son. Until gang boss killed his friend.<br/><br/>The idea of continental hotel is interesting too. When hit-man does business, they stay in the hotel so they can reset without worry. The one breaks hotel rule will be executed by the hotel. This alone can make another movie.<br/><br/>In the end, I've to say movie like this one and The Equalizer makes me aware that my time is passing, kids nowadays like movie like such, a lot of action, less story."

","This is a nice movie if you are looking for some action without any further sense.<br/><br/>Keanu is the completely overpowered Superman Hero. Killing every guy on his way to revenge. He could have killed easily some times because one of the bad guys obviously was a better fighter and has beaten him up twice but of course Keanu wins at the end. It is like one of the old superhero movies or MacGyver. The bad guys always kill the innocent just for fun right when they get in front of the gun but the main enemy can't be killed when unconscious. No those enemies has to be brought into some prison and even then the bad guys don't kill them immediately no they chat and have a good time and before he gets killed the boss leaves, of course, maybe he is too soft to see his enemy dying. Just as an example of this non-credibility. But still nice brain-dead action.<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty much linear no big surprises some strange decisions and some illogic moments."

","I didn't buy it. I really like Keanu and some of his movies are really cool and interesting but this one is like an almost complete nonsense for me. Just killings and killings of bad guys because John Wick is sad and there is nothing left for him in this world. Maybe in the killers world they are like that, I don't know. I liked Taken with Liam Neeson better. It had a more credible story. In John Wick, most of the other actors didn't perform well...the son of the big boss is playing as unsustainable as he did in Game of Thrones. I guess, Keanu had to drag all this movie by himself and he wasn't that convincing all the time. Although, there are some scenes where I liked his acting and the fight scenes were pretty realistic, without too much fancy moves and visual effects. I don't want to criticize the work and effort put into this movies. Is just that this movie it's not for me 100% :)"

","Going into this film I had high hopes regarding reviews all around. Is Keanu Reeves back? No. Does Keanu Reeves excel in the role of John Wick? Yes, but not many people couldn't. This film lacked in every way possible regarding substance. When I say substance I am referring to the plot, acting, and overall feel.<br/><br/>Yes Keanu Reeves acting was on point, yet everyone else in the movie seemed like straight to DVD actors (trash). Especially the villain Michael Nyqvist. Such a corny performance. If by my taste I was reviewing this movie I would rate it at a 4. Thats a weak 4. But I am going to put myself in a neutral position since action movies aren't my forte. <br/><br/>To conclude, if you are in love with action films please see this movie! You will love it. But if you're more of a Bourne Trilogy kind of action film fan then don't. Story could have been understood by a toddler. Yet this is rated R? What kind of adults just watch movies for explosions and gunfire. Let us relate to a character."

","Not bad for movie cheap night. My wife and I went to John Wick on cheap Tuesday. John Wick was a good stress release for a bad week. What worked: Reeve's is a physical actor, how he moves, walks, etc and plays the action sequences well. Jason Statham would have been a better John Wick. The revenge plot where mobsters kill John's dog and steals his car resonates with the viewer. What did not work: The action is too fast in a video game style. There was a need for more humor, which the movie Mel Gibson's Payback implemented well. If you are in the market for a revenge flick I recommend Payback over John Wick. John Wick is okay. A VOD movie. Six out of ten."
