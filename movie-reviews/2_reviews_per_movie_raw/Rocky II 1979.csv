"LebowskiT1000","9","95","101","8 October 2003"," Excellent sequel
","""Rocky II"" is one of those sequels that is just as good as the original, if not better in some aspects.  I can't say it's better than the original because you can't have the second film without the first one.  Meaning that this film does not stand on it's own, you need the first film to understand the characters and back-stories of everything in this film. But all in all, I think ""Rocky II"" is slightly more enjoyable than the original ""Rocky"".<br/><br/>In all honesty, I think this film is better directed than the first film. The story seems to flow quite nicely and is slightly faster paced than the original.  Not only that, but the main fight in the film is much more exciting and longer.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Rocky II"" is better as well, or at least I thought so. Sylvester Stallone does a fantastic job with his role of Rocky Balboa and really struts his stuff here.  Talia Shire and Burt Young also pull off nice performances.  Carl Weathers plays the character of Apollo Creed to a ""T"".  And of course, Burgess Meredith does a fantastic job as Mickey.<br/><br/>This is one of those sequels that truly has the same feel as the original. Granted, it isn't as fresh as the original...but it's a re-match that can't be missed.  If you liked the original ""Rocky"", then you definitely ought to check this one out, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I hope you like the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-LebowskiT1000"
"MovieAddict2016","7","114","132","10 August 2004"," One of the best sequels ever made. I'm not joking.
","I have to hand it to Sylvester Stallone  he did the impossible with 'Rocky II' and made a successful follow-up to 'Rocky,' winner of the 1976 Best Picture Academy Award.<br/><br/>Some argue that 'Taxi Driver' (also nominated) deserved the Oscar more. I'm not so sure. 'Rocky' came along at just the right time  it was an uplifting story and people needed that back then. Now, 'Taxi Driver' is usually considered the superior of the two  but they're entirely different and, in my opinion (and it's a rare one), 'Rocky' is just as good  but in a different way. They're both great films, and I'm not saying that 'Taxi Driver' shouldn't have won  but I'm not necessarily saying it should have, either. 'Rocky's' achievement is monumental and it is one of the greatest films ever made. To say it's 'not as good' merely because it is more optimistic is nonsense.<br/><br/>So what's so great about 'Rocky II' and why is it generally underrated? (Its average user score right now on the Internet Movie Database -- with over 8,000 votes -- is a measly 6.2/10, compared to the original's 7.7)<br/><br/>Because it maintains the focus of the first film, and continues the story rather well. A story that didn't really need to be continued, per se, but nevertheless formed the foundation of one of the greatest film franchises of all time. That's right  many people hate the 'Rocky' sequels, but apart from 'Part V,' they're all surprisingly entertaining  and, more importantly, well made. I like them; they entertain me, and I think they all serve their purpose.<br/><br/>What's particularly interesting about 'Rocky II' is that apart from repeating the central theme of fighting Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Stallone) goes through a character arc here that many sequels totally ignore  we see the after-effects of his fight, and him struggling to adapt to the 'New Life.' <br/><br/>Rocky is not a smart person. But he is one of cinema's deepest characters. Stallone (who wrote all the scripts and directed three of the sequels) succeeds at evolving Rocky's self-confidence. After winning a small fortune from his famous fight with Creed, he goes out on an impulsive shopping spree, buying a cool car, a new leather jacket (with a tiger  the beast with the 'eye' that Rocky re-captures in 'Part III'  printed on the back), and a new luxurious apartment for him and his wife Adrienne (Talia Shire).<br/><br/>The problem is that Rocky soon runs out of money. His happy-go-lucky personality crashes when he is faced with the prospect of losing it all. He promised Adrienne never to fight again, and keeps his word by trying to get a 'real' job at the meat-processing factory (the same one he trained at in the original film). However due to staff cut backs he is fired and soon realizes that he was born for one reason: To fight. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Apollo is eager to take on 'The Italian Stallion' again  to prove he isn't the coward that criticizers are implying he is. He entices Rocky back into the ring for a final match  and to say that the outcome is satisfactory is an understatement.<br/><br/>Most people seem to forget that Stallone is almost solely responsible for the entire success of 'Rocky' as a whole. He came up with the idea, wrote a script, fought to get it made, fought to become the leading star, and literally fought to get in shape. All of this fighting paid off  and it continued to pay off as he kept on cranking out all the sequels.<br/><br/>Indeed, the 'Rocky' legacy is often poked fun at because it is the typical endless Hollywood moneymaking franchise. But 'Rocky II' and 'III' (more so than the other two sequels) have guts, power, determination and focus  they've got the so-called 'Eye of the Tiger' and I can't really say that I agree with anyone who says these movies are worthless. They aren't masterpieces but they certainly aren't trash, either. I give 'Rocky II' a hearty recommendation  it's a truly solid sequel that surprises us right when we expect to be disappointed."
"jerekra","9","26","28","16 January 2009"," Outstanding Sequel.
","""Rocky"" is truly one of the greatest films ever made. So a sequel to this film would have a tough time following it. Rocky 2 does a great job following up ""Rocky"" and is truly a great film.<br/><br/>The story starts up right where ""Rocky"" left off. Rocky goes to the hospital and has surgery and it is revealed that further fighting could damage his eye badly and make him go blind possibly. So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and starts making commercials. Soon Adrian gets pregnant. However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face.<br/><br/>This film succeeds mainly due to the fact that it does a great job continuing the Rocky saga. It starts right up after ""Rocky"" and further continues the story. It is an awesome follow up. All of the characters are further developed. Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.<br/><br/>Rocky 2 is really funny, more so than the first one. Love how Rocky goes around trying to get a job despite the fact that he has basically no education. Also humorous is how bad Rocky is at reading cue cards and what he chooses to talk about at his press conference with Apollo. For the most part Rocky and Rocky 2 are more funny than the next films mainly because of how Rocky becomes ""civilized"" in ""Rocky 3"" and loses his sense of humor in some ways.<br/><br/>The training that ROcky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film, slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders. Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.<br/><br/>No film is perfect though. The ""Gonna FLy Now"" song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They use the ""Going the Distance"" song when he is doing his training outside of his running which is fine.<br/><br/>Also the fight at the end of the film is not nearly as good as the fight in the first film. It is mainly just Rocky getting pounded relentlessly and having to overcome a superior athlete. Not like in the first film where it is an even fight for the most part.<br/><br/>A great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series."
"kezop_male","10","49","58","12 October 2005"," Same Story, Both Continued AND Re-told
","I'm old enough to remember the thrill of seeing each of the ""Rocky"" films during their original, theatrical runs. The magical component that Stallone achieved was to tell nearly the exact same story, twice in a row, with the same characters... and yet, he gives us a one-two punch that hits just solidly as the first.<br/><br/>It's truly a remarkable feat. Differences? We've already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery, the sense of learning who these people are. We already know, don't we? Yet, Stallone's characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them, seeing them in a world most of us don't know, living a life few of us would really want. While the sense of discovery about these characters is gone, our joy of being a voyeur into their world is not.<br/><br/>It's a toss up which movie, ""Rocky"" or ""Rocky II,"" asks us to suspend disbelief more. In ""Rocky,"" we have to accept that a nobody, unrated, club fighter could a) get the chance to fight the world champion. B) He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That's a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies, classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.<br/><br/>Soap opera-esquire is not a bad way to characterize ""Rocky II"" because of the emotional ride, but I don't find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky's actions are very believable, from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him (when they were obviously not), to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated, ""punch drunk"" boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey, it happens all the time. Very believable.<br/><br/>With a pregnant wife, no job, and no way to pay his bills, he's backed into a corner. What's a fighter to do? (And in this case, I mean ""a fighter"" in its most literal sense.) He's willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do: provide for his family.<br/><br/>Adrian's bit of drama is the single ""problem"" with the movie, but it's also the heart of the movie. It's not a movie about losing it all and coming back again, it's much more than that. It's about a simple man who's trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count, it puts it all in jeopardy.<br/><br/>It's not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is, for what he is, that he can continue his quest, one more fight, for his family, for himself.<br/><br/>The story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side, yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to re-imagine all the magic of the first movie and, better still, give us a second helping of it that's just as sweet. Enjoy!"
"bob the moo","Null","38","50","27 April 2002"," A good sequel that repeats the successful formula
","Immediately after Rocky's close contest with Apollo Creed, he is drawn into fame only to find it is a temporary thing.  As the money fades he finds personal crisis is never far away and is tempted into a big money rematch against Creed.  Meanwhile Creed, who should fight other fighters, is plagued by suggestions that the first fight was staged to go the distance.  Things build to the rematch.<br/><br/>Stallone proves that he has got a money making brain in his head by basically remaking Rocky.  The story covers similar themes  it's a soap opera with a fight at the end.  Here the soapy mush is mostly about his loss of money and decline back into the gutter, while we have children and comas thrown in for good measure.  This is all well and good, and Stallone doesn't let it get too mushy.  The script has some good scenes and mixes in comedy  my favourtie line being where Rocky is advised to invest his money in condominiums, to which Rocky replies `condominiums? But I don't use them.'<br/><br/>This comedy helps endear Rocky to us despite being a bit `punchy'.  The fight however  that's where the money is.  As in the first Rocky movie, the fight is a huge thing, full of emotion and welling music.  The fighting is, of course, nonsense  even sillier than the first film, but with the raw emotion and use of music you can't help but get involved  even if you don't want to!  At times it goes a bit far and may look a bit like ego-massaging by Stallone, eg the scene where he is out on his training run and is followed by hundreds of supportive children!<br/><br/>Stallone is good in all his roles, the playing of Rocky as a working class bum made good is bang on.  Shire doesn't have much to do but she's good beside Stallone.  Young is good and Meredith easily repeats his tour-de-force as the grizzled trainer.  Carl Weathers is good as Apollo Creed and this is one of his best roles.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't a classic but by repeating the basic formula of the first movie and taking Rocky back to the gutter, this remains an entertaining soap that is driven by mushy, if formulaic, emotion."
"The Grand Master","8","6","6","28 February 2017"," A worthy sequel that goes the distance.
","Rocky II continued on from the first movie, and though it was no easy task, Sylvester Stallone did a terrific job returning to his now iconic role as well as taking on both roles as writer and director.<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has retired from boxing on medical grounds and is getting used to his newfound fame. Unfortunately, his post-boxing career has not flourished which sees him going back to dead end jobs such as working at the meat packing company with his best friend and brother in law Paulie (Burt Young) to keep his head above financial dire straits and his newly wedded wife Adrian (Talia Shire) vows to stay loyal to him. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is enraged by all the hate mail that he is receiving, mostly telling him that his championship match was nothing more than a fluke and vows to do everything in his power to goad Rocky Balboa into a rematch. Though Adrian is upset with Rocky's decision to return to the ring, Rocky teams back up with his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) to regain his passion and pride.<br/><br/>The cast is faultless, and the spirit of the first movie still remains intact. In fact, I found the training scenes to be a lot more uplifting, and I found myself secretly cheering during the penultimate match. And the ending unashamedly had me in tears.<br/><br/>I've always had a soft spot for Rocky II and years later, it's one of the few movies that has me going through a roller-coaster of emotions. In some ways, I wish this was the ending of the first Rocky movie. But it is what it is. Still Rocky II is a worthy sequel that goes the distance.<br/><br/>8/10."
"Agent10","7","28","38","8 June 2002"," A pretty good sequel
","Sure, Apollo was pointlessly painted as the bad guy early in the film, but this a sequel. While it is not as good as the first film, it still embodies many of the themes and hopes which made the first film so powerful. This time, the audience got what it wanted, a win for a guy who had been kicked down for so long. With more money, the film felt more lucid and better put together, which made it a whole new experience in itself. I especially enjoyed the scene where the kids are chasing Rocky, certainly one of the most complicated and time consuming shots of all time, considering all of the extras the various sequences needed. Better than an average sequel, it still pales a shade below the original film."

","I reviewed Creed II on March 1 and I ask people how is that garbage movie beter than Rocky II? That movie is not a Rocky movie. Rocky II is a real movie it is one of the best, best, greatest sequels of all time. I love , love Rocky II to death. It is my third favorite Rocky movie of all time! I put this movie above the first one, fifth one and Rocky Balboa. This is the real Rocky, the boxing match in the finale is for real. Sylvester Stallone and Carl Weathers fought for real they did not act. Creed II is a joke!<br/><br/>""Maybe you're right. Maybe I ain't got it no more. All right.

But don't you ever come back here again, because I'm too old to waste my time... ...tryin' to train a no-good loser like you, you bum!""<br/><br/>Why is this movie so great to me: the dialogues between the cast , the chemistry between Mickey and Rocky. I love Apollo Creed who get's angry when his fans calling him a fake and the fight was fix. He is angry and he chalanges Rocky to a fight. He makes a cartoonish picture of Creed grabbing and choking a Rocky-headed chicken calling him ""Apollo Creed Vs The Italian Chicken"" I love Apollo's traning and he works hard to show everyone that Rocky had a luck. I love Rocky's life he get's married, his wife get's pregnant. He earns a lot of money from his last fight spends his money quickly. He try's to make a commercials but he stinks at it, because he can't read. For six months he was on a docks trying to find a job, but couldn't keep it, so he become a janitor in Mick's gym until he hear a bell the ring becons him one more time.<br/><br/>This is a rematch of the century after his last fight, Rocky has to come to the ring once more again, against Apollo Creed in Superfight 2. Sylvester Stallone wrote a script beautiful directed it and he acted the best ever. This is a classic it is a beautiful movie and I always prefer this movie over the first one, because Rocky wins in this movie. He should won the first fight in the first movie, but he won in this fight. Sly directed beautifuly this second masterpiece. Everyone in this movie does a great job. I love Burgess Meredith as Mickey Goldmill his best performence ever even better than he did the first time. Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed is the best of the best he has more to do than he did in the first movie. I love Apollo Creed in this movie Weathers was the best of the best. Tony Burton Apollo's Trainer was a bad- ass stick him Apollo, him and Apollo were the best opponents to Rocky I have ever seen. I absolutelly love this movie to death! I love Butkus Stallone wearing a shirt and i love how Rocky is walking his beautiful dog. I love Rocky driving a car he was hilarious.<br/><br/>I love the brutal fight powerful climax in the finale, I love the beautiful music score from Bill Conti even better than he did in the first movie. I love the traning sequence I just love this beautiful masterpiece to death! Creed II is a garbage! Rocky II is the real Rocky the real underdog movie of all time. I love the opening scene overture it is the best of the Rocky movie of all time. I love Rocky chasing a chicken to get a speed. ""You're gonna eat lightning! You're gonna crap thunder!"", ""You can beat him, because you're a tank. You're a greasy, fast, - Go through him! Run over him!""<br/><br/>Every time I drink a beer Union I remember this film. When I was 18 in 2002 I was in this bar sitting alone and the wall remind me on Rocky II every time I remember those good times I think of Rocky II! This is my favorite film, I remember this match between Rocky and Apollo I love this movie to death! Yes I put this movie above Rocky Balboa (2006) even tough I love Rocky Balboa to death! Rocky II is my third favorite film, I don't care what anyone says it is the best sequel I have ever saw! I enjoy it, every time I watch it specially the final fight.<br/><br/>I recommend this sport's drama to everyone out there to see it. Butkus Stallone had a cameo role the real life dog of Stallone I don't why he didn't had more to do in this movie. I love Sly's dog. All 4 Rocky movies are great with Rocky Balboa (2006). This is my third favorite ""Rocky"" film of all time."
"robybaggio18","8","5","5","8 August 2015"," A very good sequel
","Rarely do we see sequels which live up to the hype or stand strong against the original story, but ""Rocky II"" delivered on both levels. As someone here already mentioned, it does not bring in any new characters and it certainly does not change any of the old ones. It basically is a rematch film, going back to what worked in the original. Simple guy with poor background again gets a chance against the world champion. The first fight was spectacular, but both fighters feel empty after it. So a rematch is born! Apollo pushes for it and Rocky would grab it immediately, only his wife is stopping him. <br/><br/>The thing I like about this film is that in many scenes it feels real. Many of its characters feel real. Actually, I cannot think of anyone there who doesn't fit into the real world. Even the loud- mouth Apollo Creed is credible, he acts as the world champion. And he looks fit. I don't think I remember a boxing film where one of the fighters looks this fit. Hats of to Weathers for that. The relationship between Rocky and his wife can be felt by the audience, and I will give credit to Stallone for this because I think he is not the top of the lot when it comes to drama acting, but he found his spot here and he played it well.<br/><br/>The sequels which followed where bordering with comedy, so I think the first two films make a nice combination of sports, drama and action."

Then he's trained again by the veteran , feisty coach (Burguess Meredith who repeats efficiently his series role).<br/><br/>This agreeable predictable entertainment displays splendidly the 'formula Rocky'. The movie works at usual manner, fitting appropriately to franchise , even though we know the plot the film works . This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness, dignity , feel-good style such as the initial outing. Spectacular and climatic final bout including slow-moving images. Writer-director-actor Stallone new entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling. Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography Bill Butler. The motion picture is lavishly financed by the producers complete saga, Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by Stallone who along with John G Avildsen made the six Rocky.<br/><br/>While here the opponent is an invincible young boxer,champ of the world, in subsequent entries the contenders were the following : Rocky III against corpulent Mr T from A Team; Rocky IV against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren; and Rock 5 against an ingrate young fighter who he trained played by Tommy Morrison and Rocky Balboa proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight. Rating : Good , being impossible to dislike ,the result is deliciously corny agreeable and predictable amusement . Although we've seen it all before , Sylvester manages to make it work one more time and it works every way even better than subsequents Rockys."

","More of a coda to Rocky than sparring partner of equal standing, part II nonetheless keeps viewers vested in the continuing saga of the Italian Stallion by deepening the character and then bloodying him up. Taking place immediately after the events of the franchise champ, this chapter asks a lot of the audience, namely cheering for the same fighter in pretty much the same fight with the same opponent even though our titular hero's previous loss defined the character perfectly. Sure, you don't have to win to be a champion, but it's to this powerful sequel's credit that you root for the underdog all over again. Plus, the climactic battle royale makes for some of the most compelling fight scenes ever committed to film. In this PG-rated sports drama, Rocky struggles with family life after his bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch. At this juncture, Stallone runs the risk of making a sophomore slump and lessening the emotional blows landed by the first chapter. By giving more screen time to the wonderful Talia Shire as Adrian, he actually develops the title character even more. Their romance is palpable, as is the hard-hitting re-match. Stallone might have taken over directing duties from John G. Avildsen, but he exhibits a confidence that makes the transition seem seamless and even one-ups the intensity on the canvas. Bottom line: Much Punch-Drunk Love"

","""Rocky II"" isn't as wildly entertaining as the next installment (which is my favorite), and it's slightly overlong, too. But it's still an earnestly made, appealingly tender sequel. Stallone dedicates time to character development and quirky humor (the scene where he attempts to star in commercials is really funny), making the movie more suitable for viewers who prefer dialogue over action - although the actual fight is more dynamic than the one in the original."

"ElMaruecan82","8","3","3","25 November 2011"," From ""There will be no rematch"" to ""Yo Adrian, I did it!""...
","""There will be no rematch  there will be no rematch!"" ""I don't want one"" This is from the first 'Rocky' film, right after the final bell and before Bill Conti's 'Final Bell' would conduct one of the greatest and most unforgettable concluding movie scenes. Rocky didn't win the match, but he went the distance, he didn't get down and never abandoned  and if Apollo won the fight, Rocky won the heart of the spectators, of the woman he loved, of all the viewers in the world who identified with one of the greatest and most inspiring cinematic characters.<br/><br/>Apollo didn't want a rematch, neither did Rocky. So when ""Rocky II"", the sequel starts with Apollo asking for a rematch, you know there's a problem in the continuity department. Does it really matter? Not necessarily, but this is what separates between the great and the very good films, ""Rocky II"" ignored some plot details left in the glorious first opus because it was a necessary move to justify the sequel's very existence. Still, did the film need a sequel? I believe if it wasn't for the series, the character wouldn't have become so hugely popular all over the world, and there's so much optimism in Rocky and Adrian that it's impossible not to root for them, not to feel something for the little universe evolving around them. So even if the quality suffers, the series helped to construct a legend, and if anything, it contributed to show how great and deserving of a Best Picture Oscar, the first movie was.<br/><br/>Consequently, there are two ways of reviewing ""Rocky II"": on its own, it's a very poignant drama with an inspiring message, when compared to ""Rocky"", it's inferior, but for its defense, it's still closer to the quality of ""Rocky"" than all the other sequels. What makes it inferior is clearly the characterization during the first act. While Rocky was a lovable dim-witted guy, his personality flirts with plain imbecility more than in one occasion, Mickey was a funny grumpy old-timer, he became annoyingly aggressive, but still this is nothing compared to Apollo, who traded his charismatic flamboyance for an obvious villainous mask, so obnoxious and condescending toward Rocky, it's like the fight from the first film never happened. In ""Rocky II"", it looked like everything was changed for the sake of the plot, accentuating the character's worst traits, with the exception of Paulie, whose transformation is left for interpretations... but doesn't add much to the appreciation of the film anyway.<br/><br/>Another weakness is in the pacing, too slow and not as rich in characterization and content as the first, basically, it's all about Rocky losing the money he won, trying to find a job, becoming a bum again, teased by Apollo for the rematch, facing Adrian's refusal, and then Adrian's coma leading to a whole sequence where we're waiting for her to wake up and give her blessing. I'm not saying these parts are not correctly handled, on the contrary, many of them provided some of the most memorable sequences of the trilogy. The problem is that nothing can ever catch us by surprise, the viewer is inevitably ahead of the characters, we know Rocky will play (and certainly win) the fight, it's just a matter of time; we know he'll endure all the humiliations, from Apollo or Mickey, before becoming a hero again. It's so obvious that I could even picture Stallone thinking ""Rocky must conquer his pride back, so he must lose it before."" This obviousness was totally absent from the first film, that ended up with Rocky, unexpectedly losing the match. Here, we're 100% sure that he will become the Worldwide Heavy Weight Champion.<br/><br/>So, inferior to the first film, ""Rocky II"" is, but it's so superior to the following sequels, that nonetheless, the movie works on an emotional level. It features so many scenes that are both poignant and inspiring, the marriage proposal in the zoo, Rocky's attempt to build a life for his family, the coma sequence, the birth of Rocky Jr., Rocky's (hairy) heir and the father-and-son relationship growing between Rocky and Mickey. Being analytical toward the movie's minor flaws doesn't prevent from appreciating its simple and naive beauty; as a drama it's a decent one, and as a sports movie, it has the merit to surprise us through a very spectacular finale. I don't know if it's realistic or not, but at least it leads to a thrilling suspense and a final bell sequence that echoes the greatness of the first one.<br/><br/>Despite everything, the ""Rocky"" films have a unique talent to redeem their own flaws through their finales, proving that it's all about 'heart' and passion, and any rational attempt to decorticate what works and what doesn't, ultimately loses its significance. Whatever you say about ""Rocky II"", it's a very good film that remains faithful to the spirit of the first one, it sins by being a little over the top sometimes, but overall, it's a great work from Stallone, and as the first film I saw from the series, it'll always have a special place in my heart  I remember how I wished I could be among those schoolchildren who ran with Rocky through Philadelphia.<br/><br/>Now, I'm more skeptical toward that running scene, which is too 'cinematic' to be fully appreciated on a realistic level ... but Stallone is so sincere and genuine that I'm sure he only wanted an inspiring on-screen depiction of the 'Rocky' effect, an ordinary hero whose running steps pave the way for success, inviting us to follow them to go the distance, over and over again."
"KnightsofNi11","7","5","6","31 August 2012"," A downgrade from the first film, but still fun
","Three years after the Academy Award winning success of Rocky, Sylvester Stallone reprises his role as the heavyweight boxer in Rocky II, which he writes and directs this time around. Picking up right where the first film left off, Rocky II follows Rocky Balboa as he starts to adapt to family life after barely losing his match to Apollo Creed and then marrying his girlfriend Adrian. However, the adjustment to this new, much softer and simpler life isn't easy, especially while Apollo Creed continually harasses Rocky for a rematch, as he is hungry for the knockout, rather than just the winning score. Rocky must then make a choice, does he stay retired from boxing, or does he train to take on Apollo Creed once more? Rocky II, despite what die hard fans of the first film might say, is actually pretty good. It doesn't have the raw visceral emotion behind it that fueled the fire for the original but, as far as sequels go, it's really a decent film. It works really well as a continuation of Rocky's story, and it makes for a worthwhile addition to the first film. It's a lot of fun to see Stallone and Weathers reprise their roles as Rocky and Apollo, and getting an extra dosage of some great boxing is really exciting. Rocky II, while devoid of the visceral poetry of the first film, is pretty darn good.<br/><br/>It's not without a few problems of course. It's a much more watered down and predictable story than what we received in the first film. From the beginning we can see where the story is going and, while entertaining, it's not surprising and lacks the wow factor of the first film. The character of Rocky also changes a bit. He becomes softer in this film, and at times a caricature of the fabulous underdog protagonist Stallone established him as in the first film. He's a little goofy at times, and not as enjoyable as a character as he was in the first film. It's still great to see him get back in the ring, but it's not quite the same as the original.<br/><br/>But despite no wonder and power in the story, it's still really fun and Rocky II is plenty enjoyable to watch. If you liked the first film then I would definitely recommend watching the sequel, as it's just more great Rocky Balboa action, and a pleasant continuation of the story. It's not as fantastic as the first film, but worth two hours of your time."
"Special-K88","Null","14","23","18 April 2002"," pretty good for a sequel
","Imperfect, but highly entertaining sequel picks up right where the original left off. Having suffered heavy brain damage as a result of his brutal battle with the hard-hitting champion, Balboa decides to call it quits and dedicate his life to his newfound love Adrian (Shire). However the intense media hype, public mockery from the champion Creed, and a discovery that 'normal' life isn't all that it's cracked up to be draw him back into the ring for a highly publicized rematch. You have to be patient this time around as the film is slow going at first, and lacks the emotional punch of the original, but an exciting, edge of your seat climax makes it worth the wait. A good follow-up considering the impact of its predecessor. **½"

"ReelCheese","9","5","7","5 September 2006"," Another Knockout
","You've got to agree with Leonard Maltin when he calls this film more of a remake than a sequel. But that doesn't mean ROCKY II fails to make for some fantastic, crowd-pleasing entertainment! Sly is back as The Italian Stallone, having just taken the beating of his life from barely-victorious Heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). For medical reasons (and for new wife Adrian), our lovable lunkhead attempts a life that doesn't involve black eyes and punching bags, but it's tough out d'ere. Meanwhile, Creed is throwing a hissy fit because he took such a walloping from an unknown Philly product. If you don't know where this is going, there's a good chance you too have recently been in the ring with Creed!<br/><br/>No one has ever argued that ROCKY II is as good as the original, but it's not exactly thousands of miles behind, either. Picking up in the immediate aftermath of the original, the viewer is immediately sucked right back into Rock's world. We already know him so well. Whereas in the original he was all about boxing, here Rocky is forced to start a new life, making for an interesting fish-out-of-water scenario. We all know he's going back to the ring, but writer-director Stallone keeps us guessing as to how.<br/><br/>The single biggest strength of the film is the amazing finale, which actually outdoes the big fight from the original. The audience can't help but make pained faces as Rocky takes one of the most brutal beatings ever filmed. Punch after powerful punch, it often seems completely hopeless for him. It's also worth noting that Stallone, and indeed the entire case, is as likable as ever.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the biggest weaknesses are the sporadic slow-moving moments. In particular, Adrian's birth-induced coma is just a tad contrived and out of place. This traumatic event was presumably included to give Rocky (and the audience) a stronger thirst for victory. Truth be told, Stallone didn't have to go that far; the birth of Rocky, Jr. was more than enough dramatic inspiration. I'm willing to bet if Sly had it to do over again, he'd scratch the coma.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare films that is so good you forget about or forgive its minimal flaws. Often degraded as the black sheep of the series, ROCKY II is surprisingly effective with Stallone the actor, writer and director in great form. Highly recommended for all filmgoers."

The darkness made Rocky great ( that flick was about a man, his metamorphosis into living and love, not about boxing!), yet Sly keeps just enough of that in this movie to keep us all on that level and successfully adds more...I love the LOVE between Rocky and Adrian, and to me, they epitomize true love. Simple is clearest!  In Rocky II you have a sense of evolving with this man and his family, both as a husband and a father and ultimately, the Heavyweight Champion of the world. Ok, it's just a movie, but no one can just sit there in their chair when they do the fight scenes! A great flick, gotta love the stars in this one, a powerful sequel!

I gave this one 8 out of 10 , this film is 1hr59 mins directed written and stareSylvester Stallone They've come a long way together...a boxer and a dreamer. But there is still one fight left. this is a classic fight film showinng how rocky wants to go back to noraml but has to make end meat to get by. this film is more fun as we get to know the carracters more. As we find out rocky has no eduation due to his as he tries his hand at comericals. Rocky Balboa is enjoying life. He has a lovely wife, Adrian, had a successful fight with Apollo Creed and is able to enjoy the money<br/><br/>he earned from the fight and a new endorsement deal. Unfortunately, Rocky becomes embarrassed when failing to complete an advert and ends up working in a meat packing company. He believes that he will no longer have a career as a boxer.<br/><br/>So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and a child comes along as well to add to the borad However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face. But with adrian in hospital rocky put his life on hold his carer on hold Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.<br/><br/>The training that Rocky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film,<br/><br/>slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders.<br/><br/>Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.<br/><br/>. The ""Gonna Fly Now"" song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They used the ""Going the Distance"" gets you pummped up. And ready for the action<br/><br/>A great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments.

","Following on from the success of the first film in the series Rocky 2 continues the story and focuses on the theme of handling life after greatness. As Apollo's ego gets the best of him and forces him to pursue Rocky outside the ring to get him back into the ring we see an aimless Rocky looking for work and dealing with the fallout of being a celebrity. This movie improves upon the first with Rocky's trainer Mickey given a greater role in preparing Rocky for the ultimate rematch awaiting. Once again the soundtrack, the emotion and the fight this time bigger and more dangerous combines to create a master class film."

What follows is the formulaic plot that will delight the populace and satisfy our need for another result. Once again we have conflicts in Balboa's life. He is still maligned by his own manager and brother in law. But it's going to be a fight and I'm not spoiling anything by saying that they will meet and they will pound each other half to death.

The movie is a bit faster than the first one and that makes it even more entertaining. But, I said 'almost every way' because, as a sequel, ""Rocky II"" lacks originality. The movie has some new elements added and the ending is better, but it is almost the same as the first one, more of a copy than a sequel. However, it is kind of a story where it could not be any other way. The movie holds attention, brings emotions and ending keeps you at the edge of the seat with a lump in the throat and tear in the eye.

"Desertman84","9","2","2","23 October 2011"," More Of A Love Story Than A Sports Film
","The sequel to Rocky happens to have two things that Rocky Balboa embrace in this movie: family life and a Hollywood ending. It focuses more on the love story and relationship between Rocky and his girlfriend,Adrian instead of him as an underdog and struggling pugilist.<br/><br/>Rocky II is the sequel to Rocky, a motion picture in which an unknown boxer had been given a chance to go the distance with Apollo Creed,the World Heavyweight Champion. Sylvester Stallone, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Burgess Meredith, Burt Young and Talia Shire reprise their original roles. The story has Rocky Balboa,a Philadelphia prize fighter enjoying his brief fame after nearly defeating world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. When Rocky is offered lucrative product endorsement opportunities, his limited education and lack of sophistication quickly become an impediment to his future success, causing him embarrassment and his pregnant wife, Adrian,a great deal of financial concern. Meanwhile, Creed is brooding over his near loss to a fighter he considers an amateur far beneath him and decides to goad a reluctant Rocky into a high-profile rematch. With the family resources dwindling and his pride wounded, Rocky decides that fighting is all he knows and makes the fateful decision to climb back into the ring once more with Creed to vie for the championship belt, despite assurances from all concerned that he will blind himself irreparably.In the end,we all know that Rocky wins this time against Apollo Creed and becomes the new World Heavyweight Champion.<br/><br/>Just as I have stated,the movie has become more about the character of Rocky Balboa particularly his relationship with Adrian,his becoming a father and the financial conflicts they encounter after getting married.This is where the movie deviates from becoming a sports picture and becoming a love story instead.Nevertheless,it remains a good sequel but it deviates from more from Rocky the underdog boxer which made it more popular.Also,I do believe that the movie tried to go through a Hollywood ending this time with Rocky winning it all at the end. Although the cast did good in their performances,the second film did not hold a candle to the first Rocky,which I believe happens to be a cinema masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made.Overall,it was still an enjoyable movie to watch.<br/><br/>Personally,I rank Rocky II as the third best among the movie franchise behind Rocky and Rocky Balboa."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","2","2","11 November 2008"," Apollo's mad
","So when Apollo says at the end of the first film that there isn't going to be any rematch (sorry, ""ain't gonna be no rematch""), I'm thinking that it was probably because no one really knew how big the movie was going to be. I think the original film was meant to be a single movie that stood on its own, but a sequel was squeezed out when it turned out to be a Best Picture winner, and since this first sequel was so good, it seems only natural that it should be followed by four more, right?<br/><br/>The movie starts off exactly where the original film left off. It even shows the last few minutes of the last film before continuing on to the hospital, where Creed's attitude has changed drastically. He is no longer telling Rocky that there will be no rematch, now he's so angry that he's demanding, from his wheelchair, that Rocky get up out of his own wheelchair right then and there and they'll finish the fight. <br/><br/>Rocky, in his unique way, politely wonders what Apollo's so mad about, but ultimately they both go their separate ways in the hospital because, of course, neither can really stand up under their own power too well by this point. <br/><br/>Rocky and Adrian are now married and shopping for a new house and a new life together using Rocky's winnings from his first fight with Apollo. But the money goes quickly, even though it was such a huge and commercially successful spectacle. You remember in the original film, for his amateur fights, his total prize money was something like $40. Rocky brought home tens of thousands from the fight with Apollo, but he and Adrian bought a house and a car and various other essentials and soon found themselves again with little to no money and a whole list of new expenses.<br/><br/>Rocky promised Adrian that he wouldn't fight anymore because she just can't handle the stress and the emotional trauma of watching her love getting battered all over the ring, so when Apollo begins publicly chastising Rocky for winning by freak chance and demanding that he face him again in the ring, Rocky has to grin and bear it even though he is forced to earn money doing janitorial work at the local boxing gym. <br/><br/>The movie works because it plays on all the things about Rocky's personality that made us love him in the first place. A lesser film would have had the hero angrily fling his mop and bucket against the wall and get right up in Apollo's face, but Rocky is more devoted to his wife than to his public image, so he literally does grin and ignore the taunts and demands coming from Rocky, even though his life has become something so timid and moneyless.<br/><br/>Adrian hears the demands and watches Rocky worriedly, afraid that he is going to give in to the pressure and endanger his safety again, but even though Rocky is tentatively interested in defending his reputation in the ring, it is more important to him to make his wife happy. <br/><br/>But both are driven to the ring because Apollo has lost the respect of his fans, who think that he was paid to take a fall, and Rocky and Adrian are on their way to the poor house. It is one of the film's few week moments when she changes her mind and urges him to fight again, but the formula that we saw and loved from the first film comes back and it still works here. <br/><br/>The only major drawback of the first Rocky sequel is that it is much, much too sappy. There are genuine emotional moments when Adrian falls into a coma after giving birth to their son, but mostly it is things like the army of thousands of children following Rocky completely parent-less as he goes on one of his famous training runs. I realize he's famous in Philadelphia now, but an endless crowd of children? Come onÂ…<br/><br/>The fight at the end of the movie fulfills a dream that was unfulfilled in the first movie, and some people will argue that it is unnecessary since, in some ways, it sort of negates the whole purpose of the first movie ending the way it did, but Rocky II is such a good movie that this doesn't seem to matter. The fight's not as well done as in the original film, for most of the time you may find yourself wondering why Rocky, from start to finish, doesn't block Apollo's punches at ALL, but it is no less exciting. In the world of sequels, this is definitely among the best ones.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way, Rocky II was released the day after I was born!"

This is the one with the most comedy in the Rocky series. Like the scene where Rocky is driving the car. That scene was funny because Rocky clearly does not have a drivers license. It is not as good as Part I but that does not mean it is bad. If you liked Part I, You should like this. It has a great training scene. This time we get 2 training scenes.

This was the last really dramatic Rocky film before the more entertainment/action route of Rocky III and Rocky IV, well thats not really true as Rocky V went back to the drama but sadly I think Rocky V is by far the worst of the series. Rocky II however is just great. Rocky gets married to Adrian but its not a smooth ride. An eye injury keeps Rocky out of the ring, but as he squanders his money, and Appollo pushes for a rematch will the Italion Stallion have to fight in the big rematch? You probably all know the answer to that but if you are lucky enough not to have watched these great films look out for the DVD box set and watch some of the most downright entertaining, moving and uplifting films of the 70's and 80's.

This was supposed to be a story about personal triumph, not about winning. This is just capitalization. One can not stay mad too long, even after the films ridiculous opening sequences, as Apollo's bombast and newly threatening character does not allow for it.<br/><br/>Again, excellent character actors, but that does not fix this mistake of a sequel. The story is drawn out, overly simplistic and irritating. After the first ten minutes you just want to witness the actual fight. <br/><br/>There is a reason why Apollo did not want a rematch, folks. <br/><br/>Get it discount."

","Despite keeping the same formula from its predecessor, Rocky II with the already established and exciting soundtrack from the first movie and inspiring story still is very enjoyable. Some aspects are better worked, but isn't greater than Rocky. The boxing is much more tied and subordinated to Rocky's daily life, as after the first, he doesn't see much need to return right away to the ring. When certain problems start to appear and the return of insecurities and fears from his doubts about himself, of he is or not someone in life, he is tempted to return to the boxing. Due to the characters already are established, more time is used to develop their personalities. Especially, Rocky and Adrian, a couple that complement each other and are the soul from the film. A nice highlight is Mickey played by Burgess Meredith, he with Sylvester Stallone deliver some very intense and heartening scenes. A novelty is also exploiting Apollo Creed's side in his obsession with Rocky so there is a new fight. The new clash between the two is much longer and intense, better choreographed and filmed, with a breathtaking ending as in the first movie."

","I really liked the first movie, so i expected a good sequel. Was it? Oh yeah, it was. It was as good as the first Rocky!<br/><br/>So let compare the two movies because they are a bit similar: same characters, same antagonist, similar story lines...<br/><br/>I start with Stallone aka Rocky. In Rocky 1, he had great one-liners, he was very cool. In Rocky 2, he's as good as in the first movie, still cool one-liners, still cool, always playing with his little black ball and wearing his hat, i really like him. <br/><br/>Mickey and Apollo Creed are as good as in the first movie.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Rocky and Adrian is a little bit better than in the first movie, but still bad. For the second time, this relationship is the weakest point in the movie and destroyed a bit the overall impression.<br/><br/>Worse than in the first movie is Paulie. This guy annoyed me and is the second big weak point in this movie. Fortunately, the relationship and Paulie are the only two weak points.<br/><br/>The training sequences were, like in Rocky 1, awesome.<br/><br/>The final fight is way better than the final-fight in the first movie.<br/><br/>Summary: The movie has +/- the same positive and negative points like the first movie. The only thing which is worse than in the first movie is Paulie, and the only thing which is better than in the first movie is the final fight. So my review is similar to the first review. If you liked the first movie, and I'm sure you did, you'll most likely enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>7,5 out of 10"

","The first Rocky sequel has boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), having just completed a boxing match with heavy-weight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) that resulted in a draw, is now struggling with his new family life as he is having troubles finding work outside of the ring. <br/><br/>The film starts off somewhat slow and steady as we delve into Rocky's post-boxing life of marriage and children and his job-hunt struggles. That gave the plot a nice touch of drama and heartfelt moments. However, the main intriguing element of the movie is when Apollo coerces Rocky into a rematch to prove that he is still the heavy-weight champion, and Rocky attempts to train for the match - all the while balancing his strive with his family. <br/><br/>Like all the Rocky movies, you want to root for Rocky in the boxing match, which I thought was well-choreographed, rousing and an edge-of-your-seat experiment. Sylvester Stallone does a great job, once again, in his Rocky role, and gave a heroic depiction to his character. <br/><br/>While this movie is not all about the fight but the struggles Rocky continues to endure, the good acting and interesting plot makes this sports drama a well-paced and captivating sequel.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

"Robert_duder","9","2","3","28 December 2006"," More of an epilogue than a sequel, the fans had to have it!!
","Sylvester Stallone took matters into his own hands to bring his magnificent character back to the big screen in 1979. Stallone not only penned the sequel as he did the original but he took over as director giving him the unique ability to control his characters the way he felt they should but the brilliance is that he didn't change them from their original style or character making it one of the most consistent sequels I have ever seen. Granted the characters have had some evolution since the original but it's gradual and real and the film still has that gritty, real, lovable quality of the original. It only just barely falls short of the magnificence of the original. One of the nice things is that we are given a far more in depth look into the life and personality of adversary Apollo Creed, but as far as the other characters they are really only added upon because they were so well cultivated in the original.<br/><br/>Once again Stallone picks up his unstoppable underdog Rocky Balboa and the love of his life Adrian. Stallone manages to recapture everything you loved about Rocky in the original. You do however start to see a little less of those little quirks that made Rocky so spectacular a character in the original and which eventually almost fade completely in the subsequent sequels. Nonetheless Stallone does a great job with the role again. Also returning is Talia Shire as the less shy and awkward Adrian whose romance with Rocky is at full swing including their engagement, wedding and pregnancy. Shire still is perfect as Adrian and is the perfect companion to Stallone's Rocky. As rough around the edges as he is, she suits him perfectly and their chemistry is unmistakable. Burt Young returns as pessimistic and chronically miserable Paulie. His role isn't quite as defined as it was in the first one but he still does a great job supporting everyone around him. Paulie is an unmistakable quality about the Rocky films, and Young IS Paulie. Burgess Meredith returns as tough as nails trainer Mickey, Rocky's mentor and father figure. Meredith adds such an incredible experience to the series and is the perfect mentor. In some ways he's so mean and gritty and yet he has this knowledge about him that Rocky respects in such a deep way. And finally someone who this sequel was very good to is Mr. Carl Weathers who plays Rocky's greatest challenger, the Champion Apollo Creed. Since their unstoppable battle the world now questions who truly won their match and Creed thirsts to prove his worthiness. We get a further look into Creed's home and his style and his training and the people around him including his family. Weathers is electric and loud spoken and flamboyant and is everything Creed was created to show but he has a determination going into this fight that makes him the perfect adversary to Rocky.<br/><br/>Rocky II quite simply adds everything to Rocky I that we might have wished to see after the closing credits. It's a sequel that had to be made and was made with great intelligence and clever writing and direction by Stallone giving us all our favorite characters again. Best of all it still managed to capture the heart of the original and perhaps even more so since the outcome of the fight is different. The climatic fight is still incredible despite being the same fight from the first one. Emotions run high as Rocky nearly loses the love of his life, brings his child into the world and triumphantly cries ""Adrian, we did it,"" which once again brought tears to my eyes. You can't EVER watch Rocky I and stop there, even if you never see the others you must see Rocky II because it just might be one of the most necessary and well done sequels in film history. It is the reason sequels should exist. It only manages to lose a small bit of it's original charm and still be one of the true greats. 9/10"

","Having gone the distance but narrowly lost his fight against heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in the first film, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) takes another crack at the world title, but not until after lots of soul-searching, melodrama, and the obligatory training montage.<br/><br/>The film starts with Rocky, in danger of losing his sight, promising to hang up his gloves to please his concerned girlfriend/soon-to-be wife Adrian (Talia Shire). But when the money starts to run out, and as Apollo continues to goad him into a rematch (so that he can prove to himself and fans that the previous fight was a fluke), Balboa agrees to step into the ring once more, with old pal and trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) by his side.<br/><br/>Basically a retread of the first movie, only with a different outcome, Rocky II is not as fresh as its predecessor, and suffers from some sluggish scenes: Rocky holding back on his training (his heart not in it because he doesn't have Adrian's blessing), and the boxer's anguish as his wife slips into a coma after giving birth to their son. Fortunately, solid performances from the excellent cast help carry the viewer through these slower moments, the film picking up momentum for the expected crowd-pleasing showdown against Creed.<br/><br/>After Adrian comes out of her long sleep and gives Rocky the go-ahead, the Italian Stallion finally gets his mojo back and delivers a final act guaranteed to get the pulse pounding (helped not inconsiderably by Bill Conti's rousing score). The aforementioned training montage is a blast, the boxer turning into the pied piper of Philadelphia as hundreds of children follow him on his run through the streets, but it is the long-awaited battle with Apollo that really delivers the goods: it's pure Hollywood baloney, of course, with almost every punch hitting its target, but it's hugely entertaining and brilliantly staged, Balboa and Creed pushing each other to the limits of endurance. It'll come as no surprise that Rocky wins this time, but somehow writer/director/star Stallone still manages to make the fifteenth round edge-of-the-seat stuff, right up to the final bell.<br/><br/>7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."

There are small errors, such as the impact of the first film is already lost or there are some scenes that have extended more than the account, such as when Rocky works on something he does not like and we see him doing the same things.<br/><br/>Anyway it is a more than worthy sequel, and if you have wanted more with the first installment you will like how continuity is respected."

","After the success of Rocky, the producers were eager to make a sequel. While Sylvester Stallone would write the script and star again, John G. Avildsen was tried to Saturday Night Fever (a script disagreement led to him being removed from the film three weeks before shooting started; he was replaced by John Badham). Stallone went all out to get the job, just like he did to get the starring role in the original film. Producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff understood how much of the success of the first film came from Stallone and helped him get the job.<br/><br/>The film begins immediately at the close of the last movie: world heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has defended his title against Rocky Balboa (Stallone), yet his promise of no rematch is rescinded the moment reporters surround the two men. Their private moments are much different then public; when Rocky goes to Apollo's hospital room, he asks if he gave his all. The champion agrees that he did.<br/><br/>Rocky decides to retire after learning that he has a detached retina and that one punch could blind him. He has a new life now, one of endorsements and agents, but also one of true love as he marries Adrian and they expect a child.<br/><br/>Apollo is on a different path, as he's now obsessed with a rematch. Rocky is the only mark on his perfect career. Despite everyone close to him telling him to drop it, he demands a rematch, smearing the good name of Rocky even in retirement.<br/><br/>Rocky's inexperience with money and inability to read basically reduces his life to pure pain. Even a job at a slaughterhouse doesn't last as the film compounds the boxer's tragedy, moment by moment. Rocky begs Mickey to take him back and train him, but the older boxer refuses until he sees the way Apollo is taunting him.<br/><br/>Adrian has gone back to working at the pet store and refuses to support Rocky's need to fight one more time. She goes in labor early and while their child is healthy, she remains in a coma. Rocky blames himself and stops training, but days before the fight, she awakens and tells him to win.<br/><br/>Apollo boasts that he will beat Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first match was a joke. Yet Rocky fights right handed instead of left, taking an even more brutal encounter into the fifteenth round, yet Apollo is way ahead on points. Rocky switches back to southpaw - leaving his bad eye open to damage - and takes out the champ with a massive punch that takes both to the canvas. Luckily, he rises in victory.<br/><br/>According to John G. Avildsen, another reason he didn't do this film was because he didn't like the story. He was, however, excited to do the third movie, where Rocky would have been elected mayor, only to be caught in a scandal when Paulie stole from the treasury. Rocky would take the blame and end up back in his old neighborhood. Notably, a similar plot occurs - spoiler warning - in the movie Stallone and Avildsen did collaborate on, Rocky V."

","Rocky II is a 1979 sports drama film starring Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. The film was written by and directed by Sylvester Stallone. <br/><br/>The film starts with the classic side-scrolling ""Rocky II"" title card and we are introduced to the film with a six-minute flashback of what happened at the end of the first film, ""Rocky"" (1976), where Rocky ""The Italian Stallion"" Balboa fights World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed for the title. The fight ends in a split decision (Apollo wins) and Adrian comes to rocky and they profess their love for each other, not caring about the result of the fight. <br/><br/>Right after the fight, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire) (His girlfriend), Paulie Pennino (Burt Young) (His friend; Adrian's brother), and Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) (His trainer) are bombarded with the press. The press wants to ask questions about the fight. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), his manager, and his wife are also bombarded and asked questions by the press. Both Rocky and Apollo are taken to the same hospital. Apollo challenges Rocky to a rematch, but Rocky declines and retires from professional boxing. Adrian and the doctors agree with Rocky on retiring from professional boxing because of Rocky's severely damaged eye that will need surgery and could cause permanent blindness. Rocky goes to Apollo's room (in private), and asks Creed whether he gave Rocky his best shot. Creed agrees and says yes. After Rocky's surgery is completed and he leaves the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of the changes in his life. Rocky proposes to Adrian. Adrian agrees and they both get married at a small wedding with just Marie (The pet shop owner), Mickey Goldmill, Paulie Pennino, and Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell) (Rocky's former boss; Rocky's good friend) attending the ceremony. Rocky gets a new car, house, and luxurious clothes. Adrian soon after her marriage with Rocky, announces that she is pregnant. Simultaneously, fueled with rage from hate mail from fans all over the world, Apollo Creed becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch with southpaw Rocky Balboa is the only way to prove that Rocky's stupendous performance from the last fight was just a fluke (meaning that he was crazy lucky and he had no true skill). Creed ignores his family's and friend's requests to let go and fight new opponents in the ring, and he tells his team to do whatever it takes to get Rocky in the ring, even if it means publicly humiliating Rocky setting Creed as the bad guy. At first, Rocky doesn't care what Apollo says, he won't have a rematch. However, Rocky's inexperience with money leads him into financial problems. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to find himself employment, Rocky returns to Mickey ""Mighty Mick"" Goldmill, his former trainer for the original fight with Creed, and talks to him about possibly returning to boxing and taking on Creed in the rematch. At first, Mickey rejects Rocky's offer in favor of Rocky's heath. But after Apollo Creed publicly taunts and humiliates Rocky all over the world, Mickey accepts Rocky's offer and will let himself train Rocky. Adrian speaks to Rocky and tells him the dangers of boxing and what could happen to his eyesight. She doesn't want him to fight. Rocky argues saying that fighting in the ring is the only thing that he knows and that it is the only way that he can provide for the family financially. Adrian is extremely mad at Rocky due to the fact that he made a promise to her that he would never fight again. She refuses to support him. Rocky and Mickey start training. However, Rocky starts training like a bum and has a half-hearted attitude towards training due to his wife's disapproval. Paulie confronts Adrian to settle this argument between her and Rocky, but during this confrontation, She faints and collapses on the spot. She is rushed into the hospital, and goes into labor. Despite the baby being born 1 month premature, the baby is healthy. It turns out that the baby is a boy. This is all good news. However, Adrian falls into a coma. Rocky blames entirely himself for what happened, he promises to never leave her bedside until she wakes up, and to not see the baby until she wakes up where they will both together see their baby for the first time. Adrian awakes from her coma. She sees Rocky at her bedside. The couple are shown their baby for the first time and they name it Rocky Jr. Adrian then gives her blessing to the rematch. Rocky then trains harder then he ever has in his life, with Mickey's help in and outside the gym. He finishes his training by running through the streets of Philadelphia and ending his run at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Which he also run at in the first film, ""Rocky"" (1976),) where he is joined by hundreds of other children, who are extras in the film. When makes it to the top of the steps, He does his famous pose and throws some jabs, ending his training. The night of the rematch arrives, and Creed has made a goal of KO'ing Rocky within the first two rounds to prove that the first fight going the full 15 rounds was just a fluke. This rematch is not as close as the first outing as Rocky has to fight right-handed to protect his eye from Creed. Apollo dominated most of the match and Rocky only wins a couple rounds. At the fifteenth round, Creed is far ahead by points and only needs to stay alive a few more minutes and he will retain the World Heavyweight Title. He ignores his trainer's pleas and goes for the KO to prove that the last fight was nothing but a fluke. Rocky switches back to southpaw fighting, and both of the men, tired and exhausted, knock each other to the ground. If Creed gets back up before Rocky, He retains the title. If neither get back up, it is a draw and Creed automatically retains the title. Rocky, shocking the whole wide world, gets up while Creed falls down to the ground. Rocky is crowned the NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. Rocky speaks through the microphone and states that ""Apart from my child being born, this is the greatest night in the history of my life."" He lifts the Heavyweight title belt into the air and screams ""Yo Adrian, I did it!"" (Adrian is at home watching the fight due to her baby.) Rocky throws the title belt over his shoulder and hugs Mickey in the final scene.<br/><br/>""Rocky II"" (1979) was made off a budget of $7,000,000. The film grossed $200,000,000 worldwide, making it the most successful film of 1979. <br/><br/>Rocky II was Sylvester Stallone's directorial debut in the franchise and he would go on to direct Rocky III (1982), Rocky IV (1985), and Rocky Balboa (2006). John G. Avildsen, the director of the original ROCKY (1976), could not return to direct ROCKY II due to his work on Saturday Night Fever (1977). He was fired 2 weeks before principal photography began due to a fight with an actor.<br/><br/>Bill Conti once again returned to compose the music for the film. He composed the music for the original ROCKY (1976). <br/><br/>Rocky II (1979) was the first of many Rocky sequels. It stands out as the best Rocky sequel to me. In my opinion, it is just as good as the original. Rocky II (1979) is a classic that you sure won't want to miss. 10/10. Highly recommended."

While I enjoyed the first movie, I was constantly aware of its low budget roots, the rough-around-the-edges feel to it and the slightly overlong running time. All of those factors have been cleared up in this sequel, which offers a more satisfying, perfectly made viewing experience. There are no long-winded introductions to the characters here, instead we're thrown into the thick of the human drama and the film excels as a result. It follows roughly the same template as the first, with a down-on-his-luck Rocky struggling to make a success of his life before finally giving in and then training for the climatic boxing match.<br/><br/>Stallone directed this instalment and his skill behind the camera shows with lots of well-shot sequences. The training sequence of the first film was a classic moment but this one manages to top it with a real feel-good factor. Excellent theme music helps, along with the fact that Stallone had grown enormously as an actor by this stage and thus his Rocky is a much more human, likable creation. Kudos too to the supporting players, ALL of whom are warmer than we found previously; Apollo Creed is a very human opponent; Adrian is actually likable instead of cold, and Paulie is no longer an idiot. Plus we also get Burgess Meredith on top form, and he shares some fine scenes with Stallone in this one.<br/><br/>There are plenty of entertaining moments, not least Rocky's lengthy search for an honest profession. Of course, the boxing match at the climax is what it's all about, and it doesn't disappoint: it's longer, more sustained, better choreographed, and even more violent than the original's, as the camera never flinches away from the brutality of the sport. Sitting back when it was all over, I realised that there was nothing about this film I didn't like: I found it a fantastic film in every respect."
"mmallon4","10","1","1","12 August 2016"," Rocky II: Electric Boogaloo
","Rocky II picks right off where the first movie ended and with the characters are already established, we can get right into the story. Stallone writes and directs this time, and who knows his own creation better than him?<br/><br/>Rocky II has a much higher budget than the first film and thus doesn't have the guerrilla filmmaking tactics of the first so while it loses something in that regard it's still no less a beauty of a film. They can even afford to have a huge crowd of kids following him during the training montage and possibly the cheesiest moment in any Rocky movie. We now get two montages instead of one and the series obsession with them would grow from here. The final fight benefits the most from the higher budget. We actually get to see a large crowd of spectators instead of relying on stock footage and camera angels disguising the lack of extras; while the use of slow-motion captures the pain and barbaric nature of fighting in glorious detail. When Rocky and Apollo both fall to the ground at the end of the fight, the suspense is crazy! The final shot of Rocky's beat up face as he slurs in classic Stallone fashion is so barbaric; a perfect shot to end the movie on.<br/><br/>In Rocky II we get to see what Rocky does now that he has lots of money for the first time in his life and you really get a sense of the character's new found happiness. However, he becomes blinded by this happiness and it goes to his head such as when he buys a house without even checking the upstairs. Rocky struggles with his new found fame and can't even film a simple commercial. Just like how the public turn their back on Rocky, the public turned their back on Stallone after his two follow up films to Rocky bombed; Paradise Alley and F.I.S.T. Like how Stallone had to do a sequel to Rocky in order to get by, Rocky has to fight Apollo again to get by and prove that he is not a fluke or a one hit wonder. Apollo's trainer Duke also has a bigger role here and would continue to be more prevalent in Rocky III and IV; I love this guy and his intense words of inspiration.<br/><br/>Rocky II is easily the funniest movie in the series, from his poor driving skills to his mispronunciation of words when trying to film a commercial (""Smeel mainly"") but my favourite moment is when he tries to a catch a chicken as part of his training (""I feel like a Kentucky Fired Idiot""). I also find it funny the scene in which Apollo is being consumed by hate mail telling him to kill himself; it's a good thing for him the web doesn't yet exist. In terms of more twisted humour, Rocky takes Adrian to the zoo and even proposes to her there, because you know, retards like the zoo.<br/><br/>Rocky II was the first film in the series to use synthesizers in its score and the music feels very late 70's and at times disco inspired (listen to the vocal version of All of My Life, it's beautiful). Bill Conti's 'Redemption' is by far the best piece of original music in the movie; it makes me want to climb a mountain.
Just a side note: In regards to the Rocky DVDs, only the first movie gets the special edition treatment and the rest are just bare bones releases. I know the first is considered the best but that doesn't mean there's no merit to the sequels that they're just tossed aside on the home video releases.<br/><br/>Rocky II offers everything I could ask for in a sequel, a movie which stays true to the original but offers new elements along the way. It advances the story and adds an extra layer of depth to already complex characters. In 1979 the New Hollywood movement was coming to an end and the age of the blockbuster had begun. In 1976 Rocky lost the final fight but keeping with the newfound optimism in Hollywood movies, in 1979 Rocky wins the fight (although timeline wise its late 1976)."

","ROCKY II is that rare sequel that not only continues from the ending of the first. But improves on the story as it goes along. Stallone not only writes but directs and he does a stellar job. After the first fight The fighters are rushed to the hospital. Tha fans cheer Rocky and the press hound both of them. Apollo realizes that Rocky had done the impossible and gone the distance with him. This angers him and prompts him to challenge Rocky to a rematch in the hospital. Rocky refuses saying he's retired. After leaving the hospital rocky and Adrian are married. and Rocky is asked to do commercials. except Rocky has a bad eye. and can't read properly which leads to him getting fired. After having a spending frenzy The fight money is all gone. Leaving Rocky and Adrian to get Jobs. Adrian is back at the pet shop and Rocky now works for mickey. times are tough. But Love gets them thru. Adrian is expecting a baby and for Rocky life seems good. he gets a job at Shamrock meats only to be laid off. As for Apollo. he can't let go. He gets hate mail from irate fans thinking he carried Rocky or he was paid off to let Rocky go the distance. Apollo Has a burning need to prove to the world that Rocky had been a freak accident a lucky bum. and that not only can he destroy him he will. Apollo begins a war of words designed to bring Rocky back into the ring. And it has the desired effect. Rocky broke and hungry agrees to go back one more time. except Adrian isn't happy. She doesn't want him fighting. and because of this Rocky's mind isn't on his training. and he's not focused. Unhappy that Adrian is unhappy and that he let down the most important person in the world to him. When Adrian has the baby a month prematurely and is in a coma Rocky is in despair. He doubts himself and is full of worry for Adrian. until she comes out of the coma and tells him to win. Rocky trains hard and this time stuns the world by beating Apollo and becoming the NEW Heavyweight Champion.<br/><br/>The writing is top notch. Stallone has infused these characters with so much personality they actually feel like real people. the writing is top notch and it was done before it became a clichÃ©d genre all by itself. The Story is typical Hollywood magic. And Stallone makes it feel special. And it is. ROCKY II is the last really pure Rocky picture in the series because after this Rocky moves further away from what really made him and his friends truly special. ROCKY II is like a little slice of life with some really good friends. and a great time is had by all."

","I didn't hide the fact that I was a bit disappointed with the first Rocky film. It won Best Picture, but I wasn't terribly impressed. I wanted goosebumps, but didn't really get any as the film climaxed. So needless to say, I was far from thrilled about facing SIX MORE installments of this thing. But I figured, datedness--which plagued the introductory chapter so much--will eventually stop being a factor as the movies become newer. <br/><br/>And rightly so, Rocky II is better than Rocky I. There's conflict. There's struggle. There's adversity. And everything that happens--every plot point--is well-deserved this time.<br/><br/>However, Rocky II isn't a perfect movie by any means. Much of the first act is disjointed, but sets up everything that follows well. Picking up right where we leave off in the first film, Rocky is fresh off his fight with Apollo Creed. And although Apollo technically won by decision, the champ is facing scrutiny from the public saying the fight was rigged or that he shouldn't have won.<br/><br/>Rocky, on the other hand, has moved on. Or at least it seems that way. He and Adrian get married and start their lives together. But Creed is taunting Rocky to get back into the ring again for a rematch.<br/><br/>Not that Rocky wasn't already an affable character, but here, we learn more about him, which makes him even more likable.<br/><br/>In this one, the themes are also much more interesting. Much of this film is about Rocky becoming famous and recognizable--automatically bringing more meaning to the first film--but then also shows how easily the public forgets about him and what he accomplished.<br/><br/>One of the great scenes is when he tries to read the lines for a commercial he's doing, but can't get any of them correct. Stallone just plays dumb so well.<br/><br/>Unlike the first, Rocky actually has his back up against the wall. He's being laughed at by his peers, and his relationship with Adrian actually has some issues. It's nowhere near as easy this time around for Rocky. And by now, we know the characters well enough to appreciate it all. After watching this one, I finally got goosebumps--along with a few tears.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 92"
"luke-a-mcgowan","5","1","1","1 January 2016"," Promising elements, but a less triumphant final product
","How this mighty character fell. The best part of Rocky II is the opening few minutes, which is just the final scene of Rocky. After that it takes a noticeable step downhill. Whilst Stallone is still a talented writer and actor, he seems distracted by the additional task of directing, which he is far less capable of and it impacts his work negatively. <br/><br/>I didn't care much for Creed's sudden mood swing between the end of Rocky to the start of Rocky 2, which chronologically happens in about 20 minutes but has Creed completely change tack. Now he wants a rematch more than anything in the world. Rocky turns him down at the advice of his doctors and Adrian, who point out that a beating like he had in the first Rocky could make him go blind. Instead, Rocky proposes to Adrian (in one of the cutest scenes outside the original Rocky) and the two of them start setting up their life together. These early scenes do great justice to the Rocky-Adrian relationship I so loved in the original, and Stallone as a director is able to understand them because he created them with his writing and acting. Everything from his nervous proposal to his saying ""thanks"" do Adrian's ""I do"" is pure Rocky-Adrian delight. Whilst trying to embark on a commercial career, you can still tell that Rocky values Adrian's opinion more than anyone else's and that makes their relationship so honest and believable.<br/><br/>Rocky runs into financial woes when he can't hold a job and turns out to be terrible with money. This was a nice plot point because too often boxing movies end with the triumph and we are left to assume so much afterwards. It also does much to push his rematch with Creed, which needed a legitimate reason on Rocky's end. During the film's best scene, when a tearful Rocky pleads Micky to let him be part of the one thing he understands, we as an audience have come full circle and are ready for Rocky to get back in the ring. However, clever writing and great work from Stallone and Meredith help us realise the gravity of Rocky's health. It's solid work.<br/><br/>Stallone retains much of what I loved about Rocky - his low-self esteem, his disarmingly pleasant manner (his ignorance of trash talk in the press interview with Creed is almost Forrest Gump levels of innocence, but not jarring) and his thug-with-a-heart-of-gold demeanour. Talia Shire gets less to do with Adrian, because she goes through each of her plot points jerkily as Stallone the writer/director drops them in her path. Unfortunately, she also spends a large chunk of the movie in a coma, where the film really falls apart. Her refusal to give Rocky her blessing to fight Creed again is distracting for Rocky, which is subtly weaved into his training scenes that already contrast sharply with Creed's, but when she goes into a coma the film grinds to an excruciating halt. Besides one very touching bedside scene where a tearful Rocky tells her to sleep as long as she needs, the film is boring and slow while she's in her coma. We find ourselves pleading for her to just wake up already so we can get into the fight. Eventually, Adrian wakes up with all the drama of Seinfeld's The Other Side of Darkness and with probably the most hideous deus ex machina in film, has a change of heart and tells Rocky to win the fight. <br/><br/>Then we get back to what we want: the glorious music, Stallone putting himself through hell as he trains, the big run up the Philadelphia steps (which is cheesy but utterly delightful when he's surrounded by locals). Unfortunately, the big fight is a colossal let down. Rocky is knocked down twice after taking about 50 hits to the head (so much for protecting his eyes) and shrugs it off with a ""darn it"". None of the punches feel real. There's no drama, because it's recycled. We don't feel Creed being worn down like he was in the first one and Rocky's continual getting up feels more like a film script than a genuine moment of triumph. When he finally knocks Creed out, I was just glad it was over."

","The second instalment in the Rocky series, Rocky II follows the aftermath of the events that transpired in the first picture and follows Rocky Balboa who, after his loss to Creed, retires from boxing and gets busy enjoying his new found fame but after failing in multiple facets of life, he returns to the boxing arena to face Creed, who's been consistently goading Balboa for a rematch.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky II stays faithful to the spirit of the original but is highly erratic with its theme & characters. Rocky's inability to handle his sudden fame & money in an effective manner is the story's core element but it's not well executed. Much of the picture feels like plodding for we already know what awaits in the end and can't wait for that final battle, which fortunately is as impressive as it was in the previous chapter.<br/><br/>The set pieces do benefit from a bigger budget, Stallone's direction isn't very good but it's still passable for the most part, Camera-work is best during the training & boxing segments, Its 119 minutes of runtime is excessive for the story it packs in, Bill Conti delivers another sensational soundtrack that's in tune with the last feature while the performances from its entire cast is a step down when compared to their input in Rocky, although it isn't a major departure.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Rocky II heads into the right direction and tackles the right themes but due to Stallone's inexperience as a director, it isn't able to address & execute them properly and is certainly no match to its groundbreaking predecessor. The final act is pretty much its saving grace for without it, this would've been a highly frustrating experience. Predictable but also true to its origins, Rocky II may not deliver the same high thrills but it manages to be fun & entertaining in bits n pieces, and is worth a shot."

","Following up a classic is hard to do. Rocky was a perfect film that, if we're to be honest, didn't need a sequel. But the nature of the business is what it is so sequels to box office successes are inevitable. This is the first sequel in the Rocky series, all of which are less inspired than the original but still entertaining in their way. The story in this one has Rocky marrying Adrian and trying to step away from boxing. Meanwhile Apollo Creed has trouble dealing with how the first fight went down. So he challenges Rocky to a rematch, leading Rocky to once again train with Mickey for the big fight.<br/><br/>The cast from the first film returns and all are excellent. Stallone not only acts and writes again but this time steps into the director's seat. There are some great moments in this one, and it is certainly a very good movie, but it stands in the shadow of the first film more so than the later movies in the series. In part because it's the first sequel but also because it's the only one that looks and feels similar to the first Rocky. But that's also part of what's so good about it. It's an enjoyable, albeit unnecessary, continuation of the story from that film."
"powermandan","10","1","1","23 January 2015"," The Perfect Tie-In!
","It is rare that sequels surpass the original, and Rocky II is no different. It is a continuation from the first, finishing one adventure. This is the left-over movie. Does that mean it sucks? No! Despite this not measuring up to Rocky in 1976, Rocky II is where the inspiration just begins.<br/><br/>It picks up right where the first one left off at with the press following Rocky and Apollo into the hospital with both men drastically injured. Rocky successfully went the distance with neither men winning. Having to spend some time rehabilitating, Rocky quits boxing and tries to work with brother-in-law, Paulie (Young) at a meat factory. It doesn't last and Rocky realizes his true calling. With an angry Apollo taunting a vengeful rematch, Rocky must not only fight for himself, but for his new wife (Shire) and child.<br/><br/>Rocky II tends to deal more with Rocky's family and married life. He marries Adrian, they have a kid and there's lots of homie stuff. This is meant to to show what Rocky is fighting to keep, whereas the first one showed what Rocky is fighting to get. There is more chemistry that happens across the board int he first, but Rocky II is dragged in various sections. There's too much time focusing on Rocky's downtime from boxing. When the movie shifts to the boxing portion, it becomes more inspiring than the first and very exciting to see. He trains harder for a more gruelling match. The actual fight in this is a big step up from the first since the first showed only about 1/4 of the fight. This shows about 90% of the fight and is great to see this nobody from Philadelphia finally come out Heavyweight Champion of the World.<br/><br/>3.5/4"
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","1","1","28 August 2014"," A very strong second entry that remains hard hitting
","The world is not always the nicest of place to be, even when things are going your way. This is one of the most important life lessons to be learned from this movie. Rocky (1976) was about an everyday guy that was thrown into the spotlight from individuals from higher places and proved to others that he was something. However, even with all the hype, as time went on, the ""Italian Stallion"" didn't get very far. It's the sad truth. The public is a tough crowd to please. Once out of the direct visual pathway that is the person's eyes, the memory immediately begins to fade. The old saying stays true no matter what - ""Out of sight, out of mind"". This is what Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) must overcome again in this installment and it fits in perfectly. <br/><br/>After being ignored two films after his debut in Rocky (1976), Stallone incorporated this real-life experience into the screenplay of this entry. Here Stallone brings his fans back to Philadelphia to continue the story of Mr. Balboa. After displaying to the world his ability to box, Rocky decides to hang up the gloves and move on. He marries his love Adrian and begins creating their own life together. Sadly with this comes a cost. Rocky can't find anything lucrative enough to help support Adrian and himself. This aspect of Stallone's writing is reflective to what he went through after his debut and it hits home with force. It's very frustrating to try and start over again and expect to have a different outcome from the previous one. In a way, all this does is remind Rocky of what he's good at - fighting. It's a development that Rocky goes through that makes it all the worth while.<br/><br/>Another part of Rocky's development lies in him becoming a little more civilized. People complain he can't read, so he decides to read more often. It's a nice little addition to show that although Rocky is different, he's listening for suggestions to help make himself a better person. As Stallone's second film as director, it shows that he took careful time to make sure that the arc Rocky goes through is eye opening. The supporting cast from the original return as well. The only problem here is that some characters have motivational changes for certain opinions without a clear reason. There are conclusions that can be drawn to why, but it would be better to have a clear reason. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) returns for a rematch and is this guy ripped. Weathers really outdid himself this time. <br/><br/>Talia Shire continues to make Adrian a great supporter of Rocky. Nobody could ask for a better girl. Burt Young as Paulie also supports a little more than the last time. Lastly Burgess Meredith as Micky still is able to stick it to Rocky when he needs it most. He was a key player to begin with so its important that he hung around. The cinematography by Jaws (1975) cameraman Bill Butler, recaptures all the money shots from the first film which is also good. When it came to the fight sequences, the editing was quick to the point and kept things moving. It also made the film that much more entertaining. Finally, Bill Conti's second score to the movie was just emotional as the last. There were tracks that were repeated but at least the tracks weren't edited or mixed with others. I think Conti even made a few new tracks as well, which is always good. A worthy follow-up.<br/><br/>Aside from having some unclear motivational changes, the continuation of the life of Rocky successfully continues to push the character to different heights. This and the strong direction, entertaining match sequences emotional music and likable supporting cast makes it all more enticing to see."

","Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed, while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch. It's the best boxing film yet, but there is more to it than just the sport. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone acting. But the movie has enough to keep you entertained. Stallone is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. From an artistic standpoint, there were some story elements I didn't think were needed. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. My overall rating: 7/10."

","Rocky 2 continues the same type of storyline the original had. It has touching moments, exciting moments, thrilling moments and all of these are pretty good. <br/><br/>Rocky is now spending money endlessly with his payment for the fight in the 1st movie. He starts to lose control and struggles to get a job. Eventually he accepts his true path and agrees to a rematch with (the now bitter) Apollo creed.

"BobStage","8","1","1","26 May 2007"," It balanced out very well...
","The reason I vote this film 9 out of 10, as I did with ""Rocky"", is that this film balances out incredibly well. The balance of these films is the reason I vote them so high. Allow me to explain.<br/><br/>The first hour or so of ""Rocky Two"" was very painful to watch. Not because of the actors or direction, but the story line. I frowned when Rocky and Adrian are just buying on impulse, wasting a lot of money, but the part that really hurt was when Rocky is dressed as a caveman and is doing commercials. That part was humiliating to the character, and it shows how famous people making commercials can turn into something absolutely stupid.<br/><br/>However, the rest of the film was very well done. Sly is the obviously ideal Rocky, Talia is in her element, and the supporting characters are all good. Carl Weathers was on the fence in my opinion, because I didn't like the way he talked of himself in the first person. In my opinion, he was much better in ""Rocky 3"".<br/><br/>The movie was at its best up to when Adrian wakes up from her coma and tells Rocky to fight Apollo Creed again. The training scenes are always my favourite parts of the ""Rocky"" movies, as are the final fights. The music is amazing, the training believable, and they completely balance out the films.<br/><br/>""Rocky Two"" is a great movie to watch, as are the first and third of the series. Indeed, I think this saga will always stand with such series as ""The Godfather"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Batman"", and those other series that will forever be watched by generations to come."

","after the success of ""Rocky"" it was almost inevitable that the public would want to see how rocky would fare with life after celebrity. and at a time when sequels were virtually unheard of Stallone delivered the goods. ""Rocky II"" is darker than the first and is a little more entertaining, but retains a lot of the gritty realism of '70's America. this is also not so much a sequel but more of a continuation of rocky's life which starts exactly where the first film ended.<br/><br/>After being forced into the re-match with Apollo Creed, rocky is faced with the prospect of losing his wife after she slips into a coma after giving birth to their son. he looses interest in training for the fight ans spends his time by her bed side, eventually she recovers and instructs rocky to ""win"". what comes next is the fight itself which is far superior than the first, obviously because of the bigger budget, but nonetheless is very enjoyable to watch, and excellently choreographed, and the make up is just as good. Leading into the nail biting finale (if only real boxing was like the rocky movies). in my opinion the rocky movies keep out doing the previous one, so roll on ""ROCKY VI"""

In the meantime he gets married, spends all his money, has a baby, gets on with training and competes in the coolest boxing match ever filmed (f*** Cinderella Man).<br/><br/>This is basically a repeat of the first film. Rocky's down, gets up, goes back down, gets up and gets the job done with style. Stallone, director here as well as the writer, does a good job in every department, making Rocky II an entertaining (if a bit overlong) sequel that's sure to delight everyone who liked the first film. The film feels like treaded ground, but isn't that what we want? That final fight is awesome even to this day, Stallone spent 4 months alone editing it. It payed off."

","What can one say about Stallone? A guilty pleasure he is, for one.And his movies as well.I think its become fashionable to trash him and the movies he makes. Lets not forget, the genre he tackles is emotional, action packed entertaining blockbusters and not some mind twister which is going to be some cult classic. Rocky 2 falls in the sphere of an entertaining, action movie with dollops of emotion that will endure through the ages.Why? Coz it carried the saga forward in a logical manner. It takes the story forward and throws light upon the character's development. How Rocky still thinks like a street fighter when in fact he is fighting for the biggest prize-- the heavyweight championship. The fact that it takes time for this to sink in shows that Rocky SLOWLY builds up momentum and takes off; just as he does in his training run.Stallone may be one of the most humane and underrated talented Hollywood stars ever. Has any other major A list star ever managed to create such a wonderful and inspiring character?He did 2- Rocky and Rambo. But Rocky will go down in history as one of the most loved, inspiring and unique characters in movie history.Rocky 2 tells us how he manages to conquer the world and kill his demons once and for all. It is not just Rocky's story, but our story as well.We all have a little bit of Rocky in us. And it is stories like these that inspire all of us to be better men. The message of this movie in my opinion is that the 3 things most worth fighting for are- family, love and self respect. Rocky is the man we all can be; if we just try a little harder and have a deep faith in whatever keeps us alive."
"Paynebyname","10","1","1","19 May 2005"," My favourite Rocky film
","God I love this film. The best rocky in my opinion and such a great sequel. It starts exactly where the first one ends. Grabs the audience, as a sequel should, by showing again the fight from Rocky I and then developing the characters further. Whether Apollo frustrated by only just winning, Rocky and Adrian as they marry and have a child or Mickey spending that time with Rocky in the chapel. The tenderness between R and A is just wonderful. Unlike some directors they just keep the romance simple and I just love the innocence of their relationship. Him a lowly boxer, she a dour shop girl but they love each other and that's all the need. The training sequences are brilliant, making you wanting to punch the air when they've finished. The fight is great, unrealistic maybe but exciting nonetheless. My favourite scene though is right at the end. Everyone slates it but it always brings a genuine tear to my eye. He's beaten Apollo and achieved his dreams but the only thing important to him is showing this to his wife. The emotion of his 'Yo Adrian, I did it' is just wonderful, like a young boy wanting to show off to his mother. Rocky has been through hell but all he wants is his wife to be proud of him. Mesmerising and touching."

","This movie is not significantly inferior to the original, and both belong in the top 250.  It is the quintessential American film, the story of the underdog. Rocky II is merely the realization of Rocky's dream in the original.  They are really two parts of the same movie.  I would rate this film slightly below its predecessor, but not even a full rating point. Granted, Rocky III and V were bad, but Rocky II was great.  (Rocky IV was pretty good, too--probably a 7.5 to 8)."
"Old Joe","Null","1","1","16 May 2002"," The rematch of the century!
","`There is one thing I want you to do for me, win, win!'  These are the words of Rocky's wife Adrian, recovering in hospital. Many movies have defining moments, with this part being no exception. Rocky II gives the audience a chance to see why Rocky Balboa is not just some street fighter, but a true champion. In some ways Rocky II is better than the original, which for me is hard to admit or write.<br/><br/>After the controversial first challenge match in which spilt-decision awards the Heavy Weight title to defending champion, Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa officially retires from boxing. However the Italian Stallion' finds it difficult to get work and coping with his new found notoriety. Apollo is also feeling the pressure as the calls for a rematch increase. Marriage to long time girlfriend, Adrian complicate matters, when she strongly objects to Rocky's return to the ring. He cannot turn away from the only life he has ever known and once again the training begins. When Adrian falls unexpectedly ill, it seems Rocky has lost the will to fight. Upon her recovery, she asks one thing of her husband  that he win. Spurred on by this and with help by Mickey, his trainer and Adrian's brother, Paulie, Rocky gets back into shape and once more enters the ring for the fight of his life a second time!<br/><br/>This movie is a great follow up to the original. The cast, which for Rocky II has not changed that much, do it all again. Sylvester Stallone has now taken another added pressure, to just writing the story and starring as the `Italian Stallion', he now directs the film, which is a great effort. I felt the character of Rocky in this film was interesting, as we get to see the side to him that I am sure audiences would have been scared to see, that he is losing that desire to fight. However after the words from his love and most important person in his life, Adrian, he gets the only encouragement he needs. Taking on another aspect of this movie, did in no way, hamper the role of Rocky by Stallone. In fact I believe it improved it.<br/><br/>The other cast members were also great. Telia Shire, was magnificent as the faithful wife of our champion, and again proves what a relationship is all about. Then you have the arrogant, but honest trainer Mickey, who tells Rocky to shape up or ship out as there is no room for any doubts. I love his role and perhaps that is the reason why I can say this set of sequels remains of mine favourite today. Rocky's angry opponent, Apollo Creed, is once again portrayed by the wonderful Carl Weathers. He means business this time, and for fans of this film it makes a much better film, as some of the fans of boxing question that the last win by Creed is fake, making him want a rematch, to prove he is a champion. <br/><br/>This story was a good follow up to the first film, showing Rocky to be a struggler, was an ingenious piece of writing on Stallone's behalf. He tries to be something else other than a fighter, yet in the end, everything points to Rocky being what he always wants and in some way has to be. In addition to having the rematch with Apollo Creed, making it all the more interesting.<br/><br/>
I want to take a moment to reflect on what a brutal sport that boxing is. I mean we know what damage a boxer can do to himself, with head injuries being something they have to live and face once they step out of the ring. In Rocky II, the doctor has recommended' that Balboa stay away from professional fighting, yet Rocky and I am sure real fighters ignore medical advice and take the ring, when in all seriousness that is the worst thing that they could be doing. <br/><br/>The finale to this review, I would like to say that to make a good man, he needs a good woman, and a good friend told me that. Women can bring out in men, something that changes them. Although I am currently single, if l am to find a great girl, I would like them to bring out the best in me. That is what Rocky and Adrian do for each other and in some way it makes me want to find a special' person, that I can call mine. Nevermind about the fight, Rocky is already a hero in my corner of the ring. Go the Italian Stallion'<br/><br/>Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10"

It is destiny that brings Balboa and any human back to what we were really meant for, as Balboa returns to boxing and wins the championship from Apollo Creed. Rocky II gave the message that all of us have a certain destiny to return to for success and the greatest happiness. This almost matches the original since the theme of destiny is restored in the original Rocky destiny was proven in Rocky II Stallone returned to his original destiny.

Unlike 3,4 and 5 this film has depth and a believable storyline you get to know a bit more about the characters. Stallone wrote and directed this too and he made a very good job of it. He also gives a very good performance and one that he never matched until Copland nearly 20 years later. They also must have had a bit more money to play with as the fight at the end is fantastic. My favourite scene though is when Rocky is running through the streets of Philadelphia followed by hundreds of kids. All in all a great film I'd give it 8 out of 10."

You could honestly cut these two together and watch it seamlessly enough.
While Rocky spent time introducing characters and setting up the protagonist as a legit underdog, Rocky II has no obligation to do this and instead explores Rocky's new found fame and the reasons why he ends up going for the rematch against Apollo after he originally retired.
This sequel is not better than the original but it is a fitting (and dare I say, necessary) second chapter. The final act is especially brilliant and hits home right to the end."

There's a great point to unearth here, a deep dive into the unseen trials that occur after the crowds have gone home, but Rocky II never quite hits that paydirt. It asks the right questions, spends a lot of time digging, but lacks the raw, self-aware poignancy of the original film and ultimately falls back on many of the easier tricks that served it so well the first time. We get a laundry list of reasons why the inevitable rematch shouldn't even be competitive - lack of motivation, physical shortcomings, personal distractions - but that's quickly smoothed over by a reheated training montage and the climactic fight scene plays out like a well-rehearsed dance number. It wants to be potent and powerful again, to hit just as hard as that loaded first punch, and it gets close.

","I'm not sure exactly what the point of this movie was. The storyline is very similar to the first film, the finale is just as ridiculous and we are again subjected to endless Balboa ramblings. It is also painfully slow and unnecessarily long.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully produced and Bill Conti's soundtrack is excellent, arguably even better than the original. One thing you cannot deny about Rocky movies is that they all look and sound amazing.<br/><br/>The Balboa vs Creed rematch is much more exciting and comprehensive than the original bout and is very well directed. However, it is absolutely ludicrous that these men could take such a beating and come out of it alive.<br/><br/>This is also an extremely corny film. Mickey is almost a cartoon character at times and the workout montages are incredibly tacky, especially the scene where hordes of children chase Rocky down the street (and across a busy main road). Even in only it's second incarnation, the Rocky franchise is starting to become a parody of itself.<br/><br/>Talia Shire is excellent as Adrian and continues to be the highlight of these films. Carl Weathers also gives a strong performance, injecting some more authenticity and likeability into the Creed character.<br/><br/>Fans of the first movie will probably be very happy with this but personally I couldn't quite see the point of it."

","Now that I am reviewing all the Rocky films, I am shocked I haven't got to this one yet. It's not bad, I just didn't know how to review it.<br/><br/>This film has the same pace and tone of the first film, and in my opinion, is the second best Rocky film. One of the things I take back most from this film is that Rocky tried to get a regular job, but it is tough to do that, even in today's society. It took a while for me to get my job!! I also take the whole commercial scene into note, the reason being, like Rocky, sometimes I have trouble while working, but I can do it, and I'm not the one that's being rude. I'm trying. I also noted that on the first film with the scene of Rocky and Gazzo when Rocky didn't break the guys thumbs.<br/><br/>But despite the fact that Rocky had a job briefly, funds run out, and Apollo Creed challenges Rocky to another match for his respect and to prove that he's the better fighter. What touches me, is that despite Rocky being unsure about his training and despite the fact that Adrian falls into a coma, Rocky finds his confidence restored after Adrian comes back and encourages him to ""win"".<br/><br/>I also learned something from Mickey. Would you believe that? I learned that despite your mentor or trainer yelling at you and insulting you. Maybe they are trying to push you to your full potential. Now this is not the case for everybody, but I believe it is the case for trainers and SOME supervisors.<br/><br/>The final fight in this movie, as rotten tomatoes says, had me on the edge of my seat. The fact that Apollo was really cutting into Rocky, and the fact that Mickey was saying that Apollo was ""literally"" killing Rocky. Meaning that Rocky could've died from Apollo. (Mickey references this in Rocky III). Despite a brief double KO, both boxers are knocked to the ground and are scrambling to get up. Honestly, even I was yelling at my TV for Rocky to get up, because I wanted him to win. Heck, the whole world wanted to!!<br/><br/>Rocky manages to beat the count, and Apollo loses. But Apollo gets his respect back, and earns respect for Rocky when he hands him his belt. I felt the same wat Rocky did when he won when I got a certificate. I held it up like he did. Only I have no Adrian. Lol.<br/><br/>My second favorite Rocky film, it has great charm and helps me with life. I will always cherish it."

"view_and_review","7","0","0","23 June 2019"," Rematch
","Apollo Creed was seriously dissatisfied with the results of the first fight with Rocky Balboa though he won. He won on a split decision and being the champ that wasn't good enough. He wanted Rocky one more time to punish him, and hush the doubters, and establish himself as the clear champion. As they say: pride cometh before the fall.<br/><br/>Whereas Apollo was singularly motivated you couldn't say the same thing about Rocky. He made a promise to Adrian that he would no longer fight and he planned on keeping that promise.<br/><br/>This Rocky lacked the appeal of the first. In this movie we saw Rocky kinda mulling about the first two-thirds of the movie. At first, he wasn't going to fight. Then he was taunted into fighting. Then, he wasn't really committed because of Adrian-it was all very soap opera. It was dramatic when it didn't have to be and it was outright annoying. There's little worse than seeing a person do something he's not committed to. Some may have viewed that as the conflict part of the movie that needed resolution, I saw it as the part of the script that needed rewriting.<br/><br/>I will say this: Mick (Burgess Meredith) stole every scene he was in. He was fantastic.<br/><br/>Let me also say this because it needs to be said: Rocky is a horrible boxer. He quite literally was using his face to block every punch. Did he think Apollo would break his hand on his jaw? This is two movies worth of data too so it is an established fact Rocky doesn't like his own face. But no brains no headaches.<br/><br/>As annoyed as I was with the listless Rocky and the face-blocking Rocky I still found myself pleased with the outcome. I still wanted him to win and still liked the dramatic finish."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","12 October 2017"," The saga continues in an improved fashion
","Here we have ""Rocky II"", an American 2-hour film from 1979, so this one will have its 40th anniversary soon. The first Rocky won big at the Oscars and this one here is the sequel, the first of many in fact. It is once again about Sylvester Stallone, who not only wrote the script and played the title character like in the first, but even took over from the recently deceased Avildsen as director. The story continues right after the first ended, even the very same night as the two fighters are rolled out of the ring. And once more, Weathers' Apollo Creed is the main antagonist here as this film is all about a rematch from film 1. Never change a winning script may have been their idea here as you will find more parallels. Rocky is more than ever the hero for the simple, maybe underprivileged and they badly want him to win this time. But Creed will take his opponent seriously now for sure. The Oscar-nominated supporting actors are back to, even if Young's impact was really minimal. Meredith had slightly better material. And shire is back too, not just in a stable relationship with Rocky now, but even married and becoming a mother. Other than that, I had the impression they did not really know what to do with her character anymore as some of the film's weakest moments were about her like the proposal to call the kid Rocky Jr. or the rushed in coma drama honestly did not help at all. But on a more positive approach, the quote about a woman staying a woman and a man staying a man was maybe the most memorable moment of the entire film.<br/><br/>But the film's biggest weakness, like for the first already, was the fight in the last half hour. It really is close to a negative deal breaker because it has absolutely nothing to do with real boxing. Cover (is that the word? we say ""Deckung"" here in Germany) and defense were completely nonexistent and honestly from the beating Rocky gets in rounds 1 and 2, it would have been over right away in reality. But here, of course the comeback happens. And don't even get me started on the synchronous falling down in round 15 (ofc!). It is highly cringeworthy and very obvious that this was actors performing a scripted confrontation. Such a pity as everything before was solid, even strong at times. The eventually positive verdict I give this movie is really only because the horrible execution in the last half hour still did not manage to destroy my curiosity who would triumph in the end. The film ends as abrupt as the first with the announcement of the winner. As for the first Rocky, that one also really struggled with the fight sequence, but had several other weaknesses too why I believe that this one we got here is certainly better than the 1976 film, which is perhaps the worst Best Picture Academy Award winner I have seen. This one here has better potential and I think if Rocky had decided not to fight in the face of the birth and his wife's critical condition (oh wait look at her miracle recovery), this film would have been even way better, a crucial character study. But I can see why they wanted the fight to happen again because many of the more simple audience members would have been disappointed with the build-up and then nothing. But these are probably also the ones who thought the fight was the best thing about the film and still think they know their stuff about boxing. Okay, drifting away now a bit. Overall, I give this first Rocky sequel a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out, even if turning it off after 90 minutes may be a wise decision and just read what happened in the final quarter."
"Uriah43","6","0","0","31 December 2015"," Not Quite on the Same Level as Its Predecessor
","This movie begins essentially where the first film left off with both ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) and ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers) being taken to the hospital following their brutal match. Although neither of them initially wanted a rematch events soon overtake both of them which results in Apollo Creed basically having to challenge Rocky in order to regain the respect of the public. Rocky, on the other hand, finds that life after the match with Apollo doesn't go as planned and he soon becomes faced with mounting debts and a pregnant wife by the name of ""Adrian"" (Talia Shire) to support. That said, rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it pretty much followed the same pattern as the first movie except that it was even more slow and predictable. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie by any means. But I don't believe it was on the same level as its predecessor and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

Only Talia Shire was convincing.<br/><br/>Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene. <br/><br/>Rocky II is more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it.

For me, this philosophy is indeed the true heart of Rocky and it's really not important if Rocky wins or not. For that, Sly is perfect as he seems to act naturally : big but loving mouth, small but well-educated brain. Talia Shire is his perfect wife as she is this sweet shy mouse who becomes a mother and finally a support in his boxing career. Maybe i turn into a old grouch, but those late 70s movies were also cooler than 2K10 : no CGI, no mobiles and colored fashion as well. Next, whereas actual movies always happen in NYC or LA, this one was shot live in Philadelphia. In conclusion, it's an interesting sequel and at least, a movie that can't be done anymore."

","I didn't really like the first rocky but i had high hopes for the second one. It seems like i was right. It was very entertaining. This is a good movie about boxing and marriage. Sylvester Stallone did a very good job acting out rocky. I loved how Stallone acted and directed this movie.The story was very entertaining. It is about Rocky when he got a draw with Apollo the champion. Then they decide to have a rematch. Of course, You all know who's gonna win, right? I recommend this movie to everyone but please watch the first rocky first. I kind of hated it but it's an introduction. Go watch it right now! Go Go Italion Stallion!!! 9/10"

","It's the rematch of the century as Rocky takes on Apollo creed. Sequels rarely live up to the original but I think this is one of the few that do. This story takes place right after the first rocky/apollo fight as Rocky and Apollo are taken to the hospital. Apollo(Carl weathers) immediately challenges Rocky(Syylvester stallone) in a rematch for the heavyweight title and Rocky tells him and the press that he is retiring. Life seems to be going great at first for Rocky and his now wife Adrian(Talia shire.<br/><br/>They get a new apartment, car, watches, and they seem to be doing great for awhile. But then Rocky starts to have a hard time finding a job and he can't do commercials because he can't read. Then his best friend Paulie(Burt young) gets him a job at the meat packing place he works at but then Rocky gets canned right away because he hasn't worked there long enough. Meanwhile Apollo creed is suffering from the press and they are calling him a fake and they think the fight was fixed. This angers Apollo and he humiliates Rocky on TV. Thats when Mickey(Burgess meredith comes in and wants to train Rocky again. Adrian doesn't approve so Rocky starts training like crap and it doesn't get better when she gets in a coma but she wakes up after a couple of days and they have there newborn baby Rocky jr.<br/><br/>Now Adrian approves and Rocky starts training hard again and it's time to fight Apollo creed in the rematch of the century. All in all a very great sequel thats a lot like the first but the big fight at the end is really good and it keeps you at the edge of your seat! recommended for anyone.10/10"
"Mr_Censored","9","0","0","11 March 2010"," The Return of the Italian Stallion
","The original ""Rocky"" was such a success that a sequel seemed a no-brainer. In 1979, Sylvester Stallone returned to the big-screen as Rocky Balboa, while simultaneously serving as writer and director, in ""Rocky II."" The film re-united Stallone with the core cast of Burt Young, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers and Talia Shire, was a smash success and -- at the time -- the most successful sequel to date. It's easy to see why.<br/><br/>Picking up where the first film left off, ""Rocky II"" follows the fight between Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa all the way to the hospital, with Creed hungry for a re-match and Balboa announcing his retirement. Things don't go exactly as planned for our hero, however, and as he tries to settle down and live a healthy lifestyle, he only comes to realize that he should embrace his fate, doing the one thing he knows best, ultimately getting back in the ring with his nemesis for Round 2.<br/><br/>While most films end with a happy ending and never deal with the ugly aftermath, ""Rocky II"" is different in that it finds its titular character broken, beat and bruised, both physically and mentally. Although he gets to marry the love of his life, Adrian, he finds that his initial success is short-lived and struggles to stay afloat. Instead of repeating the formula of the first, this film merely serves as an extension of its predecessor, and in pretty much every respect, succeeds. Stallone is spot-on yet again, and pulling triple duty doesn't seem to phase him in the slightest. ""Rocky II"" is the perfect companion piece to ""Rocky"" and much like the first will leave engrossed and on the edge of your seat."

But Apollo Creed, feeling Rocky winning was a fluke,wants a rematch and Adrian is pregnant, Rocky has to make the decision to retain his greatest accomplishment-his pride.A excellent sequel to the first, Rocky II stands strong to the original and tells a fresh new story.

","Rocky two picks up almost at the same second the last one leaves off. Rocky has been hurt badly and retires from boxing and marries Adrian and settles down. He quickly spends his fight money buying things that they want a house a car and other expenses. Apollo Creed on the other hand is humiliated beyond belief his fight with Rocky is met with scorn from his fans and Apollo wants Rocky back in the ring for a rematch for the Title. Rocky soon is broke and trying to find a real job and Adrian gets pregnant. Apollo begins a harsh campaign to draw Rocky back into the ring and suddenly everything falls apart for Rocky. Rocky accepts to fight Apollo and Adrian gives birth prematurely and lapses into a coma. Rocky questions himself and wonders if fighting Apollo is what he really should be doing. Adrian recovers and tells him to win and Rocky trains and meets Apollo for one last chance at heavyweight Glory. Now the Story is not original but Stallone breathes fresh life into it and makes it seem fresh. This is the Story most Rocky fans remember fondly and this is the story most Rocky fans Wanted.

","This movie was fantastic, after the first Rocky movie you feel you want to see more out of Rocky, you want to know all the emotion felt after the first fight between Apollo Creed.....and Rocky II does this. Bill Conti's score is just fantastic, as the training scene before the fight delivers a rush through you with motivational music. Then the fight, which if you are a fan or professional of the boxing world you know the fight is hardly realistic. But who cares it delivers all the drama that is awaited for during the whole movie and the long time Talia shire is in a coma. The scene where she wakes up and captivates Rocky's mind to win is the best scene of all Rocky movies, as the score of Bill Conti kicks in and Burgess Meredith quotes ""Well what are we waiting for?"".....which is when Rocky begins to train, Geat Movie Moment!!!!.....<br/><br/>I would have to say also that Burgees Meredith was a catalyst for the success of the first two movies, he played his role to perfection and i thought that without him no other Rocky movies should have been made.<br/><br/>Which leads me to another topic of ""this should of been the last Rocky!""......it should of ended here and the story of Rocky Balboa would have been known as a great two movie classic. But no, it went on and i feel the rest of the Rocky movies ruined the brilliance of the first two. whilst being interesting to watch and at times motivational they just didn't have the edge and they turned the Rocky series from cinema classics to over the top Hollywood action.<br/><br/>As for Rocky VI, i just saw it and i was appalled, the story has just gone too far and the reality of Rocky has just gone way out the window.<br/><br/>But for Rocky II......what a movie!.....9.9/10"

","Rocky II picks up where the first Rocky left off. People begin to accuse Apollo of fixing the fight and of being a disgrace to the profession, prompting him to challenge Rocky to a rematch. Meanwhile, Rocky has retired from boxing. He marries Adrian and has a son, but he's having trouble finding a job. Pretty soon it becomes apparent that the only way he can support his family is if he goes back to boxing, so he accepts Creed's challenge and begins training to become the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky II stays true to the feel of the first film, making it one of the better sequels.<br/><br/>Rocky is the single best underdog story ever captured on film, and it was a huge success, and seeing as Rocky lost by split decision at the end of the first film, it was a good idea to make a sequel. Sylvester Stallone wrote and directed this movie, and he made it a lot like the first film, with some added stuff. However, there seemed to be a little of the finesse of the first film missing. It didn't have exactly the same feel. I think it was that the fight wasn't that important in the first film but this movie is all about the fight. This movie is the last good drama in the series before it turned into an action series with the 3rd installment.<br/><br/>All of the actors from the first film return to their roles, and everyone does just as good, although Rocky comes across as vastly uneducated in some scenes whereas he seemed to at least have a high school diploma in the first film.<br/><br/>This movie is very similar to the first film with what many people would call a more common and likely ending.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Definitely a very good sequel. The circumstances leading to Rocky's re-entry into the ring are well depicted. Rocky , who decides to retire after a drawn match with Apollo Creed , accepts the re-match offer from Creed after he is humiliated from every side and particularly from inside. Feeling guilty about this , he is not able to train properly and this puts stress on Adrian and she slips into a post-delivery coma. To an extent, the story was predictable. The background music is very good and the fighting sequences and the children running after Rocky etc were well shot. The fact that a nobody fighter goes on to win the Heavyweight title is kinda inspiring."

","My Favourite of the series, only marginally more so than the original as the humour is increased, but not so much that it becomes embarrassing. Rocky, although now a celebrity in Philadelphia sees his life become increasingly difficult. He is struggling with money after marrying Adrian and hearing she is pregnant. The only solution it seems is a rematch with Creed, but he risks losing his sight and family. Again, every performance is good, but it is the banter involving Rocky and his knowledge of finance, and how to cope with being a B-list celebrity which makes the movie most effective. Rocky is taken advantage of, everyone takes cheap shots at him until he realises not only must he fight Creed again, but win to prove he is not simply a fluke, a one day name, and gain respect. 9 out of 10."

","One of the best movies I have seen. Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) is provoked by Apollo Creed for a re-match as he wants to show the world that Rocky's heroics in the first movie were just a fluke. Rocky's wife doesn't want Rocky to continue fighting and slips into coma while delivering birth to their child. When she comes out of coma, things change and a new chapter in boxing is written. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa is amazing, be his interview comments before the re-match or the frustration that builds up in him when his wife is unhappy with the prospect of his entering the ring again. The fight is exciting, adrenalin pumping and highly action packed. The supporting cast is excellent, Rocky's wife, his brother-in-law and Mickey, Rocky's coach. The dialogues are classic, the story is engrossing and direction is good.<br/><br/>This is a must watch for all those who want to watch an action movie with a difference.

","Definitely one of the classics, Rocky 2 is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen. Sylvester Stallone is at his best in the Rocky series, no one could have acted out the character of Rocky Balboa any better.<br/><br/>
If Rocky Balboa `shocked the world' in the first film, surely he couldn't do it again??? Not surprisingly, the way this film builds up to the big rematch between Balboa and Apollo Creed is incredible. The odds were stacked against Balboa in the last match against Creed, and this time those odds have doubled. Against doctor's advice (amongst other things), Balboa decides he needs one last shot at the one thing that has eluded him all his life - success.<br/><br/>Carl Weathers does a fantastic job of making Apollo Creed look like he is unbeatable, and Burgess Meredith is incredibly convincing in his role as Rocky's trainer. Needless to say, the acting as a whole in this film is incredible.<br/><br/>The thing that really does it for me in these films (especially the first two) is the story of the underdog. A man who has nothing, suddenly has the chance to gain everything. It is truly a story about a million to one shot.<br/><br/>The training scenes are brilliant, and like the other films in this series the music is fantastic.<br/><br/>I feel that the inspiration comes from the strong message sent out in this film - no matter what the odds are, as long as you have heart and desire you can win.<br/><br/>So I would advise anyone to watch this film, as there is something there for everyone.<br/><br/>Go for it Rock!"

Apollo Creed, feeling the heat from the public, after barely edging out Rocky Balboa in their title bout, wants a rematch. Despite having said he didn't want one at the end of the first film. Rocky refuses, opting to retire, marry his girlfriend Adrian, and find a respectable job. But, this proves to be a harder task than he had originally expected, due to his limited education. Soon Rocky finds himself out of work and, worst of all, his wife Adrian, pregnant with their first child, once again working a dead end job at the pet store. Rocky decides that the only solution to his problems is to fight. Soon enough, against his wife's wishes and the reluctant help of his trainer Mickey, Rocky is once again training for a heavyweight bout with Apollo Creed. yes, it sounds a bit like an after school special and sometimes plays like one, but despite some cheesy and hokey aspects, it is highly entertaining. Plus there is a killer training montage and a heavyweight finale. Almost everyone from the first one is back, with the addition of Father Carmine. As well as writing the screenplay, Sylvester Stallone also directs and does a pretty good job at it."

But enough about the negatives, R2 still has the right ingredients to make the viewer feel good. I'm talking the excellent training session in preperation to Rocky's big rematch. That was well done.

Rocky decides that fighting is the only way they'll get back on there feet but Adrian disagrees and tells him they'll get buy some how or other. Meanwhile,Rocky goes to work for his former trainer Mickey (Meredith)to make a few bucks and to just be around the world of Boxing because he misses it so much.<br/><br/>Apollo Creed,aggravated with Balboa since the last fight,decides he's going to have to embarasses and anger Balboa to try to get him to agree to a rematch. It finally works, and Rocky starts preparing for the fight of his life.<br/><br/>If you like boxing, this is the movie to watch,the fight scene is so well directed and choreographed. You cannot help but cheer for Rocky when he holds up the Heavy Weight Belt and says ""Adrian,I did it!"", I guarantee it.<br/><br/>Rating ***1/2 out of ***** stars"
"baumer","9","0","0","14 August 1999"," The most memorable movie line in the history of cinema
","May contain some spoilers.<br/><br/>Forget Gone With The Wind or any Arnold film with ""I'll be Back"" in it, ""Yo Adrian...."" is the king of all movie lines.  And it fits perfectly into the Rocky character.  What else would he say after he wins the title?<br/><br/>Rocky 2 is a perfect follow up to Rocky.  And that can only be attributed to Stallone and Stallone alone.  Everyone else did their job perfectly but Stallone created this character, so why shouldn't he direct the next three films?  Here he makes Rocky 2 feel exactly like the original and I really believe that the only reason this film didn't get more critical acclaim is the same reason that Speilberg had trouble getting respect from the critics early in his career.  He is too young and wet behind the ears to be this good.  If Rocky deserved to win best picture in 76, then this certainly deserved to be out Kramer vs. Kramer for best picture.  But it wasn't even nominated, and that is a shame because this film is a perfect follow up to the first.<br/><br/>Here Rocky is still the lovable, sweet but slow guy.  He has a little more money in his pocket but it is disappearing fast.  Add to his troubles that his wife is now pregnant and life isn't so great.  Apollo Creed is also practically coercing him into a rematch that could make him blind.  There is so much to like in this film and the highlight of it is obviously the final half hour, the match.  Have you ever cheered so much for a character to win a match?  Probably not.<br/><br/>Rocky II is as good as Rocky and it is not just a repeat of the first movie. It takes the saga to the next step and does a great job of entertaining us in the process.  Stallone proved how smart of a man he is by making this film.  People thought he was a fluke when he took the world by storm in 76. But this film proved not only his versatility ( writer, director, actor, and boxing choreographer ) but his sheer ability to entertain.  There is still an innocence about this film even though it is a sequel.  And how many actors can lay claim to the fact that they are responsible for two franchises of movie characters?  I can think of one other than Stallone ( Harrison Ford ).  But with Rambo and Rocky, Stallone established his niche in Hollywood history.  This a great film.  And this has to be said, just once in a review.<br/><br/>"" Yo Adrian, I did it!! ""  There I got it out of my system."

"exterminator_99","Null","0","0","16 May 2001"," Satisfactory sequel
","""Rocky"" was a huge hit in 1976, winning Oscars for Direction, Editing and Picture and it launched Sylvester Stallone into stardom (he wrote and starred in the modern fable).  Post-Rocky he made two solid but unsuccessful films, ""F.I.S.T"" (1977) and ""Paradise Alley"" (1978).  Seemingly down on his luck (again), Stallone returned to the formula that made his name in the first place.  Donning three hats (actor, scriptwriter and director), Stallone embarked on a sequel to ""Rocky"".  The result is a predictable, occasionally slow, but strong ending film.  ""Rocky II"" lacks the charm of the original, but still pulls on the heart strings as the audience roots for the perpetual underdog in Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>The film begins with the rousing fanfare that featured at the start of the original.  In fact many features from the original exist in this sequel, making it somewhat too familiar territory.  Anyhow, we see how Rocky takes the champ, Apollo Creed (ex-Oakland Raider NFL player Carl Weathers) the whole 15 rounds after the champ claimed he would finish Balboa in less than four rounds.  In the final round, Rocky beats Creed up against the ropes and the champ is saved by the final bell.<br/><br/>Rocky and Creed go to hospital wherein the champ wants a rematch with Balboa.  Balboa declines.  The film gets bogged down in a distinct lack of action for its next third.  Rocky has to learn to cope with his short-lived stardom.  He spends most of his prize money and when he decides to retire, he finds 'regular' work hard to come by due to his lack of schooling and qualifications.  With Creed talking up a rematch and playing down the fact that Balboa nearly beat him in their last fight, Rocky and his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) agree to fight Creed again.  Rocky does this against the wishes of Adrian.  He trains poorly (we are never told why) and Mickey casts him out of his training facility.  Just as this happens, complications arise in Adrian's pregnancy and she falls into a coma.<br/><br/>After waking up from her coma, she suddenly changes her mind (was she thinking about it in her coma?!) and wants Rocky to beat Creed.  With a new child in his arms and the permission of his wife to fight the world champ AGAIN, Rocky is inspired and sets off on his training run.  A pumping 1970s orchestral soundtrack follows Rocky's old-fashioned training methods (smashing iron in a scrapyard etc) before cutting to another soundtracked scene where Rocky runs through Philadelphia with what seems to be the youth population of the city behind him.  To the theme of ""Gonna Fly Now"" Rocky reprises his run from the first film, where he sprints up the steps of Philadelphia Museum.  Only this time with a lot of kids following him.<br/><br/>The fight itself is the real highlight of the movie.  Far longer than the short, edited match from the original there is some extremely over the top yet well choreographed fight scenes.<br/><br/>Stallone followed this up with the bigger budgeted yet weaker scripted ""Rocky III"" in 1982.  While ""Rocky II"" is slow and less heartwarming than the original, it still delivers in parts.  Stallone's direction is good, his acting passable, but the script could have been more original and a lot tighter."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to the sequel to his most famous role Rocky 2.<br/><br/>Stallone once again wrote the script, but this time he is directing the movie, along with playing the lead role too. Following the theory that success is not to be tampered with, Stallone reassembles all the cast from the Oscar winning movie 'Rocky' and puts them in a movie very similar to the first. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Straight after his Championship bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) Rocky Balboa (Stallone) retires from boxing. Following a brief high, Rocky struggles in family life, while the embarrassed champ goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch.<br/><br/>Stallones second attempt at directing (the under rated Paradise Alley being the first) is an enjoyable movie, but it drags on places and pales in comparison to the first movie (which it borrows so heavily from) and is more than a tad predictable.<br/><br/>Stallone is never more at home, than when he is playing Rocky, and he does a great job again here. First as we watch Rocky nervously propose, then as he briefly enjoys the high life, before we see him embarrassed and humiliated on numerous occasions. We feel his joy, and we feel his pain. That is the beauty of when Stallone plays Rocky. A trait he seems unable to translate in to other roles. Both F.I.S.T and Paradise Alley feature good performances from Stallone, but audiences stayed away in droves.<br/><br/>All the supporting cast are great again Talia Shire, Carl Weathers and Burgess Meridith all get individual scenes to shine. The brilliant Burt Young is a little under used though, as is Joe Spinell as Gazzo <br/><br/>The boxing scenes are well choreographed, and once again, Bill Conti's score hits all the right notes.<br/><br/>A solid 8/10 for this reviewer."

He's a simple guy, with a simple life. It's simple, except he gets this chance to fight the heavyweight champ, Apollo Creed, again.<br/><br/>You recall from Rocky 1, that won Best Picture in the Oscars in 1976, that Rocky went the distance against Creed and lost on points. You know Rocky had guts, and the fire, and the will to give his best.<br/><br/>In Rocky 2, Rocky becomes a bit fearful. His wife's pregnant, he's afraid of further damage to his eye, and hey, maybe he's fearful that the first fight against Creed really was a fluke.<br/><br/>Well, the movie plods along, just like Rocky's boxing style, but it keeps advancing, getting you along with it. But boom, once the will kicks in, Rocky gives it his all. That's what I love about all these Rocky movies. He promotes the passion that if you give it your all, and work really hard, and want something enough, you can get there. You may not always win, but you can hold your head up proudly.<br/><br/>OK, sometimes it gets a bit too much, and overboard, but that is always the main driving theme in all these Rocky films, Rocky 2 being no different.<br/><br/>Rocky 2 returns the excellent cast, Stallone, Creed, Burgess Meredith is still terrific as the gnarly old boxing trainer Micky. What a terrific actor. I bet he taught Stallone a thing or two about acting and emotion. <br/><br/>So settle in, relax, and enjoy this pure entertainment that will always have you cheering at the end for Rocky.

Stallone is director here and he handles some of the dramatic scenes really well ( for example Balboa talking with Mick about going back). The training scenes feel inspirational and the main fight is exciting. There are some good dialogues here and jokes (the talk in the church about condominium).<br/><br/>""Rocky 2"" doesn't comes close to the first movie. It isn't that well made and it's not that deep.

This first sequel however, it goes a bit overboard. The hospital scene where Adrian wakes up from a coma and goes ""Win!Win!"" might be the most embarrassing moment of the entire franchise, and keep in mind ""Rocky V"" exists. That's not really the biggest problem though, what bothers me more is that this one just so soullessly copies the original. I know all these sequels have the same premise, but most of them at least get different locations, opponents or other awesome new elements. This one has Rocky fighting Apollo Creed again, right after a training montage that you could pass of as stock footage from the first one. Why still the relatively high rating then?

","Rocky was a film about overcoming the odds and rising to the top. About telling a story of a poor kid from the streets becoming a famous boxer. It was a heartfelt story and was worthy of getting the best picture nod. Since that time there has been endless sequels which pretty much tell the same story in a recycled watered down way with Rocky fighting a different boxer each time who seems to be more sadistic than the fighter before. Part II was pretty much the start of the decline of the Rocky franchise. Part III had Clubber Lang played by Mr. T who had he not been a boxer would have been a hit man for the mob. Part 4 had the Ridiculous Russian who had a punch strength that could take a mans head off. Part 5 had the young punk kid that Rocky takes in and trains, and from the first scene you knew how it was going to end. Part 6 pretty much went full circle and went along the same lines as the first Rocky. But at this point I pretty much did not care because it ran out of gas and it made its point a long time ago, and if you count how many times Rocky has been hit in the head and face he should either be dead or a vegetable."

It still has credibility at its heart {something that would vanish as each further cash in sequel trundled out}, and crucially, it still has enough rags to riches nuance to keep the audience in its palm.<br/><br/>For sure it's guilty of over sentiment at times, Adrian is now the ever loving wife, here pregnant and an authoritative voice in Rocky's life. But this continues the emotional heartbeat from the first film, there is, when all is said and done, a quite beautiful romance at the core of the early Rocky movies. Rocky 2 extends that and utilises it to its benefit. When Adrian, after rousing from a coma, tells the big Italian tank to go win, it's akin to some President or Prime Minister declaring ""we shall not be defeated"" It's inspiring stuff, and of course it sets the wheels in motion for ultimate training and the mother of all punch ups with Apollo Creed. And of course Stallone, again writing and directing, gets to deliver the alternate ending from the first film.<br/><br/>Fanciful and safe it be, but Stallone closed down the 70s with a biff bang ball of strained sinews and heroic testosterone.

Love is one emotion that the story involves to greater depth and plays with it. In all the story repeats the successful formula of the original and makes it more spicy."
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","2 January 2010"," ""I think we ought to knock his block off!""
","I have to make a bit of a personal confession here - if not for ""Rocky II"", (and had I not seen the original film more than once), I might have gone on thinking that Rocky Balboa won the match and the world championship the first time around. One gets so caught up in the euphoria of Rocky's own self-proclaimed recipe for success in simply going the distance, that it's easy to miss the ring announcer's decision that Apollo Creed was still the champion. With that said, it's a foregone conclusion that this sequel will bring Rocky the coveted prize and successful achievement of his original goal. That's OK though, as the film effectively delves further into the development of the characters and takes a glimpse into the personal lives of Rocky and Adrian (Talia Shire), now intent on marriage and raising a family. I had a hard time trying to recall the details of my own first mortgage back around the same time as the original Rocky, but sixteen grand at around nine and a half per cent sounds about right.<br/><br/>Once again, I find Burgess Meredith's role to be an anchor for the success of the first two films of the Rocky franchise. His character Mickey crystallizes the essence of the hard core boxing veteran, a gruff exterior to match the inner demons of a career that's never quite fulfilled. Mickey epitomizes the blood, sweat and spit of a profession that could be as down and dirty as that of Tony Gazzo, Rocky's hoodlum benefactor and local Shylock.<br/><br/>I guess it's fitting that the match at the finale brings Rocky the fame and glory that was long in coming but inevitable if the series was to continue. The fact that it had a pro wrestling type ending is about the harshest critique I can come up with, one of those concessions to the Hollywood Cinderella ending that films of this nature seem to rely on almost to a fault. But if you think about it, had Rocky knocked out Apollo in the fourth, fifth or sixth round, where would the emotional impact be? Better to get that adrenaline pumped up right to the max, and settle the score with no seconds to go."

Stallone, I'll say, is a much more capable director than John G. Avildsen, and paces the movie with more than just filler in between the very well-done fight scenes.<br/><br/>""Rocky II"" may be somewhat overly emotional at times, but nobody ever said a movie has to be perfect in order to be worth loving.<br/><br/>And it's better to love this than the original."
"KillerLord","10","1","2","3 February 2007"," The fulfillment of Rocky 1
","One of the few sequels that deliver exactly what is expected from it based on the success of the predecessor. Rocky II is the continuation of the journey into the life of the boxer Rocky Balboa. It explores the impact of the fight with Apollo on the life of Rocky Balboa. Though Rocky has lost the match as per judges' decision, he still has won the hearts of thousands of boxing fans. Rocky's courage and valor have struck a chord with all boxing fans who now believe that Apollo has won the match by luck. This hurts Apollo's ego and pride and he sets out to offer one more chance to the Rock.<br/><br/>The whole cast remains essentially the same. Bill Conti still delivers fine music he managed to deliver in the first part. The training sequence and the fight are even more intense and inspiring than the first part. The story I shall still say has been scripted very well to be consistent with the characters and story of Rocky I.<br/><br/>However one gets to see a bit more technical side of the boxing world in this part of the Rocky series. On one hand we have Apollo who trains intensely without underestimating Rocky this time. Micky knows that Apollo was taken by surprise by the south-paw jinx (atypical boxing method that Rocky uses wherein he uses a left handed approach) but this time he will be prepared and Rocky would stand no chance. Hence Micky delivers a whole new package of training to Rocky to change his orientation and approach altogether.<br/><br/>When Rocky's wife (Adrian) slips into a coma all training is suspended and Micky is in a dilemma. He knows Rocky needs training and at the same time realizes that Rocky cannot concentrate with his wife in coma. Here the story gets trainer-centric. So apart from acting as a window to the deeper aspect of Rocky's life this movie gives out more about the training involved and sets the story from a somewhat trainer's perspective as well.<br/><br/>I find it very difficult to make any comparison of Rocky 2 with Rocky 1. Rocky 2 is a fulfillment of Rocky 1. One has to admit that Rocky I as a single movie would be quite abrupt.<br/><br/>I can't find the heart to take any stars away from the movie! Enjoy!"

","Wow, this movie is very touching, I mean first Rocky gets married to his wonderful Adrian and then he gets a kid, there's drama, and wow, it's just better than the first. It's completely wonderful how Rocky comes back at Apollo. I mean the first one had him lose but in the second Rocky gets his victory, and the scenes are great. I love his training in this one, totally awesome. Although the only drama in the movie is when Adrian goes into a coma after giving birth to Rocky Jr. When all hope is lost, she wakes up. And the funny part is when Paulie walks into the room to give her flowers but then notices that there are people in there(Rocky/Mickey) so he leaves."

","That first fight between Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa whats a great fight that had ugly repercussions on both men. Especily Rocky he had to have eye surgery. He married Adrain and tried to live a normal life,with his black hat, black gloves, and black jacket, and a new born son Rocky Jr. but Creed wanted a rematch to prove that his 200 year fight was northing but a fluke. He made Rocky climb back in the ring. Then again Rocky has heart and guts. He didn't drink eggs but he trained real hard with Mick Rocky had to prove that he could beat Creed. The fight was ""Super fight II"" In my opinion this was a much better fight, a more competitive fight. it had better action like the slow motion shots, and it was a much more entertaining fight (then again thats my opinion. Rocky over comes the odds and become the Champion of the world while gaining the respect of Creed. (For who haven't seen it Im sorry if I spoiled anything) \<br/><br/>A great sequel"

There is some strange scenes, like the one where hundreds of kids are surrounding our hero while he's having his morning jog. But for the most part, a very entertaining sequel.

","I wanted to see Rocky beat Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>I also did not want to see Rocky beat Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>Like so many sequels, ""Rocky II"" undermines its predecessor.  It's rather like a two hour epilogue to the first film, a tacked-on ""happy ending"" to a movie that was supposed to be more realistic and downbeat.<br/><br/>That said, it's wildly entertaining.  It's more footage of Rocky, one of the most compelling characters in cinema history.  And it's got some great ""rage"" scenes featuring Apollo Creed, Rocky's worthiest opponent.<br/><br/>So, as sequels go, this isn't too bad.  It does damage, but it's also got worthwhile parts (a great training segment and a spectacular climatic battle, to name two).  It pales compared to the original, since it drags in certain parts (Rocky is training lazily...blah blah...Adrian is still sick...blah).  But when it works, you can still see flashes of the ""Rocky"" genius. <br/><br/>I guess they had to make it.  Hey, at least it was pretty good, right?"
"rebeljenn","5","2","7","20 March 2006"," Better story than the first
","'Rocky II' is the sequel to the successful 'Rocky' film, and in some ways, it is better. The story of 'Rocky II' was much better, for example. It is not as slow as the first one, and it is more powerful. The acting also improved along with the story, and the showdown between Apollo Creed and Rocky was shot very well. There is also the romantic and personal life moments for Rocky as his wife gives birth and as they struggle to make ends meet. The relationship between the two is strained, and the film captures this element well with the change in events and the focus on life, love, and training. Adrian is Rocky's strength in many ways. A better story than the original, this one should not be missed."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","2","7","14 July 2004"," Too slow, too boring, too average to be considered a worthy sequel.
","This movie is not bad but it is simply too much of a repeating session of the first movie.<br/><br/>The movie moves very slow and only really starts to become interesting after an hour. Luckily the movie begins to get pace a lot from the moment Rocky begins training again, which are also the best parts of the movie. The drama in the beginning just didn't do it for me, mainly because you already knew how it all would end.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say but Sly can't act. But still he is perfect for the role and I don't think the movie would have been any better without him. Somehow he still brings much live to the movie and the character. Talia Shire is good and believable as Rocky's shy girlfriend/wife.<br/><br/>But what am I talking about drama and acting skills? ""Rocky"" of course is all about boxing and everything else in the movie doesn't really matter. All the boxing scene's are amazing and I'm not just talking about the end fight but also about the training sessions also helped by Bill Conti's famous musical score which really gets you're adrenaline flowing. The biggest adrenaline rush of the movie is of course the end fight which just couldn't be long enough for me. The movie is worth watching for this alone and the ending actually always keeps bringing tears of joy to my eyes. Yes, I know I'm pathetic.

","I make a habit of watching movies where the filmmaker is in love with his star. There is a lovely feel to many of these. The camera caresses. The eye lingers. There is often visible emotion in the movement of the eye. This needs to be added to that class. To my mind, there are only three elements: Dumb but lovable and enthusiastic commitment from halfway until the end, after self-doubts. This time we have it accompanied with prayer.<br/><br/>These two elements are not worth watching.<br/><br/>And then you have the fight, which here you can skip to 1:42 into the thing. It is the whole thing. this is where the camera starts to embrace. The in-ring camera is missing this time; all the shots are from outside the ring, probably six or eight cameras. It fails. This is where Scorsese steps in and does it right, one of the few things I celebrate him for.<br/><br/>The only excuse for this is to substitute the appreciation of ability to take a punch for true valor, or any other admirable trait. Ostensibly Rocky did this for his wife, but we do not believe that for a second. We know who he loves.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","3","8 August 2008"," The rematch (spoilers)
","If there's one thing America loves, it's a sequel. It's more American than apple pie and anal sex. And so therefore, despite Apollo Creed's statement to Rocky in the first film that there wouldn't be a rematch, and contrary to Rocky's assertion that he didn't want one, you knew it had to happen.<br/><br/>Although to be fair, Rocky does do his best to avoid getting back in the ring. He tries to capitalise on his fame and make some money through advertising. Cue some amusing scenes where the mumbling, illiterate Rocky tries and fails to read writing from dummy cards as he attempts to sell crappy 70s cologne.<br/><br/>After this failure to crack the entertainment world, Rocky decides he can make it as an office worker...even though he has no qualifications, no experience and no brains. He just wants a job where he can sit down and no longer be pounded repeatedly in the face. It's not much to ask. But unfortunately Rocky gets turned down by every employer, who are no doubt not only horrified by Rocky's lack of credentials but by his hideous light blue suit as well.<br/><br/>But the early scenes where Rocky thinks he'll be living a life of plenty are very funny. We see Rocky spending money on horrible gold watches, a hideous jacket with a tiger on the back, a dog collar that he puts around his wrist and a car that he can't drive. And he then buys a house, mumbling like an idiot all the way through the showing. 'I like this mailbox. These numbers almost add up to nine. I like that. That's a good omen.' Ah, Rocky. Dumber than a bag of hammers.<br/><br/>But the gender issues exhibited in the film are another source of laughs. Adrian is appalled at the idea of Rocky getting back in the ring, so Rocky comes out with this nugget: 'I never asked you to stop being a woman, so please don't ask me to stop being a man.' Me man. Me club. Me beat. You woman. You wash dishes.<br/><br/>But what's up with these damn women? This Adrian bird tries to domesticate Rocky. She tries to protect him and she encourages him to get a decent job. But Rocky fails and makes a fool of himself. Damn Adrian has castrated him! Not long ago Rocky was standing toe to toe with the champion of the world. The next thing you know he's collecting spit buckets. And worse than that, he's meant to be happy about it. But eventually Rocky breaks. He realises that he was meant to fight. That's what he does best.<br/><br/>But what about Apollo's motivation for getting back in the ring? Well, his problems are different. People berate him for his performance against Rocky. And one person sends him the following letter: 'You call yourself the champ? You're a fake. The fight was a fake. Go kill yourself.' I don't know about you, but I personally think that's the best letter in the history of the world.<br/><br/>One of the funniest scenes in the film is right at the beginning. Apollo berates Rocky from a wheelchair at the hospital. Okay, it doesn't sound so great on paper. But when you consider the fact that every other word from Apollo's lips is 'chump', it suddenly achieves greatness.<br/><br/>But even at this early point in the film, Mickey knows the score. He knows Rocky needs to fight. But the road to Rocky's epiphany is mighty long. We even have to suffer through a pregnancy scare which saps Rocky's motivation. Rather than train he sits with his wife and reads poetry. And schmuck that I am, I found Rocky's writing rather sweet. Goddammit, the first film is a fairy tale and this one is a soap opera.<br/><br/>But eventually the inconsiderate Adrian wakes from her coma and tells Rocky to win. It's an incredibly hokey moment, but that's what Rocky is all about. Therefore, if you're anything like me, you end up grinning like a loon and almost start clapping in your seat.<br/><br/>Apparently, in order to beat Apollo, Rocky needs to get speed. But not just regular speed. He needs demon speed. That's the speed he needs. Greasy fast speed. And in order to do this he needs to chase a chicken (?!?). Cue Mickey berating him when he can't catch it and yelps of joy when he finally does. It's here that you can see reality floating away into the distance. But it's bliss.<br/><br/>The fight here is even further removed from reality than the first film. The boxers pummel each other constantly and there's no sign of them guarding or trying to defend themselves. But on the plus side, Apollo calls Rocky 'chump' after knocking him to the mat, so it's all good.<br/><br/>The silliest part of the fight is when Rocky and Apollo stand toe to toe in the final round and just tiredly begin punching each other in the face. One after the other they tiredly throw and land head shots, and yet they still take it. But then Rocky begins hitting Creed in the gut, so hard by the way, that he's almost lifted from his feet, and then finally the Italian Stallion floors the champion. However, Rocky goes down too. From here it's a race for both characters to get to their feet. It's something that I've never seen in boxing, and to be honest it stretches the final shred of credibility that the film has, but nevertheless it's a great moment when Rocky stands up and wins. It just goes to show that when you ignore the advice of your wife, you can achieve great things."
"David_Frames","6","1","3","6 June 2005"," Round 2!
","A remake really, in which Rocky goes back to the ghetto to warm applause and Apollo Creed goes back to his mansion only to be horrified by the suggestion that, contrary to his feelings on the night, he had in fact been beaten in all but name by the big bag of muscles from the slums. The champion's vanity would shame Narcissus and he rationalises that Rocky's 15 round slog was a bit of a fluke, after all this is a man with an I.Q so low that only someone with Aspurger's syndrome can calculate all the decimals. If he can get him back in the ring for a rematch this should become obvious to everyone. That's everyone except us of course who could tell Creed he was setting himself up to be less Apollo 11, more 13 but nevertheless the stage is set for yet enough climatic confrontation. As we've already seen most of this movie in the first instalment it's only necessary for Stallone to make some minor modifications. His wife gives birth but goes into a coma prompting Rocky to lose his focus on the fight. Mickey reassures him by saying things like ""You're gonna get KILLED"" while Creed pumps iron and laughs off suggestions that he may be making a mistake, and so on and so on... Eventually we do get to the juice as Adrian wakes up and tells Rocky that for the benefit of the film she'll drop her objections and let him fight. At this stage all thats left is for that fanfare to come on, Rocky to play chase with some kids from the neighbourhood and the throttling of some poor chicken and we're off! <br/><br/>The second film lacks the freshness of the first but it's still easily digestible entertainment. As its unthinkable that Rocky could loose THIS time there's also the inevitable win to look forward to and although hardly a tour de force from a directorial point of view, Stallone does at least acquit himself well in the staging of the fight scenes and shows sufficient acumen in pushing the right audience buttons. Not a knockout then but at least a 6 count."

None of this is near as dramatic or interesting as it sounds. In fact this sequel is a real yawner.

","I haven't seen Creed yet, either of them, and that has me concerned mainly because I hadn't even heard of them until after they were released. So I can't weigh in on all the Rocky movies just yet...<br/><br/>... But Rocky II is what I consider to be the last real Rocky movie. That doesn't mean I don't like the others, but it means that there was a dynamic shift for the series after II.<br/><br/>I and II were heavy on the characters and relationships in the universe (although Creed was under-developed in I). In Rocky II they make up for that and you get to know Creed as someone who is a pompous and arrogant poser on the surface and a much deeper and respectable character underneath. And that other side to him comes out in the final bout. He's deeper than just flash, and Action Jackson did a stellar job at portraying that in a way that was essentially nonverbal at the end. It's actually a very enjoyable performance<br/><br/>It's also a performance that rounds his character off to the point where you can believe he did what he did in Rocky III. It adds nicely to Adrian (who after II became a regrettable side character), Paulie, and Mickey.<br/><br/>In the end what you have is the last great Rocky character film before the franchise drifts away to highlight boxing, only to come back to it's roots in Balboa."

Rocky II works the same way one of those Jean-Claude Van Damme tournament movies work, it's appeal is spread over the training montage and of course in the fight sequence itself. Rocky II does have some appeal still in the characters but the first one was far more interesting in this approach and although the characters are still fresh the main reason Rocky II is enjoyable is mainly due to the reasons I mention. Once again though there is still enough magic to satisfy fans of this series and it is a formula that one quite enjoys.<br/><br/>* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)"

","If the first Rocky is about how the American dream is worth fighting for and there are reason to be optimistic, this film is about how wounded pride makes us do foolish things. The story manages to be at once familiar and conforming to the genre's tropes and subverting them a little bit. The commercial shooting sequence is fascinating in its irony and perceptive cynicism. Add in the gendered politics of Rocky being hurt that Adrian is working and like the first film this one grapples with Americana in an touching way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Stallone suffers as a director. Far too often he goes too far in the sentiment here. This film contains what has to be the worst of the various climbing the stairs sequences of the various films. The use of crowds is just awful. The big fight is more polished in this film but the resolution (i.e how the fight was won) is utterly silly. The first film resisted making the fantasy too fantastical but Stallone gives in here and the film suffers for it. I think the cinematography is far too polished as well. The sequel doesn't quite have the blue collar feel of the first film. It is a bit offputting.<br/><br/>This is a strong sequel to a truly a great film."

","Rocky II (1979) the sequel to the success of the first Rocky (1976) film, is my at least favorite movie. It is a wonderful movie continuing the story a total worth of time. It is an OK movie for me. <br/><br/>Here are the reason why is my at least favorite Rocky film: He earns a little money spends all what he earned, he stinks at the commercials, he can't read, he can't get a job, he is not allowed to fight anymore because Adrian is so selfish and doesn't let him. She is not trying to protect him, she is so selfish and she doesn't want him to fight. She is putting him down. Apollo Creed keeps insulting Rocky, Rocky starts working in the gym and he keeps getting humiliated him self twice. Once in the commercials and second in the gym. The first hour is getting boring and slowly goes , the second hour is paced when he starts training the rest sucks. He doesn't train hard over guilt of Adrian than she falls into coma and he doesn't train anymore. I am wondering how he even lasted 15.rounds and won the title if he stopped training. Everything that Apollo cared in this movie was to get a revenge. This movie is not inspiring it is a good sequel but it is just not inspiring. Rocky becomes a janitor in Mick's gym, Apollo keeps insulting Rocky with words like APOLLO CREED vs. THE Italian CHICKEN,"" with a cartoon picture of Creed grabbing and choking a Rocky-headed chicken. People from the gym was laughing at Rocky and he just ignored them. Adrian put down Rocky, even Mick put him down. Rocky asked him to train him again and Mick reject and put him down. ""Creed would have caved in the whole side of your face. Now, forget it, kid. You got the heart, but you ain't got the tools no more."" Tool's no more? Rocky has a heart so stop putting him down. Apollo and his guy were keep insulting him with a bum.<br/><br/>Mick keeps insulting him, finally against Adrian's will Rocky accept the fight, but he starts training over Adrian's quilt and than he quit training. Adrian fall's in come and he stop training that is stupid! He wanted to gave up Everything for Adrian! Trough whole film there are no boxing matches or any boxing fights, only the rematch between Rocky and Apollo that's it. In all Rocky's there are more boxing matches than one, in this we see only one fight. On the commercials the director keeps insulting Rocky because he can not read. He get's fired from his job as a meat packer. I am sorry people but Rocky II is my at least favorite sport drama film. Too much drama in it, slow pacing and field with boredom.<br/><br/>Things I do like in the film: I love the training and fight sequences. I love the music score by Bill Conti - ""Overture"", the music that Bill Conti wrote was perfect and they fit to the film. I love the opening scene when, the story picks up where the first movie left off. Rocky goes to a hospital after his fight with Apollo and Apollo demands a rematch. I love the hospital scene, I really love how Rocky is praising Apollo and him, saying they both did great. The last fight between Rocky and Apollo was filed with heart. Stallone did not insult Carl Weathers character but he made both of the characters an equal opponents and Apollo lost for one second the title. The fight for the world champion ship was awesome. I love how Rocky was struggling and was trying to find a job, I love that. I love one man's real life human's drama portraying on screen. I love how Mick was training him. I love his methods of training. I love that film is set in the 70's and I love Apollo training sequences. I also love how Tony Duke motivated Apollo in the ring. I also love that no one dies in this movie and Rocky wins the title the champion of the whole world on the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The are a lot of moments I love in this film and a lot of moments I despise and I don't like in this movie.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of his bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) attempts to lead a peaceful life with his new bride, Adrian (Talia Shire). The fame and fortune from the match soon runs scarce and to make ends meet, Rocky agrees to a re-match with Apollo.<br/><br/>That is the main plot. I think Sylvester Stallone did a wonderful job writing and directing this job. The rating I give to this film is 7/10 because the film was a wonderful follow that told the whole story to end.<br/><br/>Rocky II is a 1979 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone.

","In my continuation of watching the rocky movies comes the highly underrated rocky 2. The premise of this film sees rocky retire after the events of the first movie. He gets married to Adrian and has to deal with normal life until creed offers him the rematch of a lifetime. Now Stallone not only starred in this film but wrote and directed it. He is fantastic in this film, he is just such a likable character that you want to do well. Rocky is funny but also in pain in this movie and you see the anguish in his character at not being able to help. Everyone returns for the sequel and the standout was Carl weathers as Apollo creed. In the first film he didn't really have a character but in this film its personal for him as you see him embark on a mission of revenge. Adrian's character was further enhanced in this film and I love their relationship. Rocky's coach was again great in this film and really adds allot. The story is great in this film you see how rocky has to deal with real life situations. Then obviously all the boxing stuff felt more personal in this film and it really works. The script is okay with some decent humour I just sometimes feel like the clash of humour and drama didn't always work. The style is great with the grim reality of Rocky's world contrasting with the real world he wants in boxing. The training montage is great and the last boxing match really works. Overall this is a fantastic sequel that really worked for me."

","Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch.<br/><br/>I do not remember Rocky being so dumb in the first film. It is really played up here, and gives the sequel sort of a cheese factor. He misunderstands things, speaks funny, and gets involved in some weird incidents (such as the cologne commercial).<br/><br/>But this is probably more entertaining than the original. As good of a film? No. As iconic? No. But fun, and a good excuse to bring Carl Weathers back... that guy is amazing and deserved a bigger career."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","2","13 August 2011"," Steady, if rocky in its trajectory; this first sequel just about holds its own without necessarily delivering that knockout blow the first one did.
","We arrive at the first Rocky sequel recalling that the 1976 serial Oscar winning, and quite magical, first Rocky film was first and foremost a gritty; street-set drama about two people falling in love. The charm of it was observing a hulking and somewhat brutish, although measured, man whom exuded confidence but found it difficult to find the right words falling in with an equally young women whose eloquence happened to be one of her qualities, but whose shy characteristic made it difficult for her to truly connect with other people. Mingling around in the background was this boxing match, and an egotistical champion in the sport challenging a wild-card to a bout to prove he could, in a literal sense, just about beat anybody. It was the sports movie which wasn't actually a sports movie; a film finishing with a 'big sporting showdown' in which the only real victory was the two leads figuring out that they'd quite like to spend a lot more of their time with one another.<br/><br/>Rocky II kicks off with the final round of that fight, the titular Rocky's duel with an African-American heavyweight to whom he looses by the narrowest of margins. There is an unhinged inferring that that's what 1976's Rocky was all about; a fitting sentiment to begin proceedings when we observe this sequel is mostly all about the fight and the sports which formulates therein between the two, when allowing it to just blur into a more interesting tale, as was in the first film, is all the more engaging. That said, and by the time this first sequel is in full swing, one would have to be rather grizzled; rather sniffy to truly detest Rocky II - like the protagonist at the core of this edition, it is a tough film to love but an easy film to just slot into and generally root for.<br/><br/>When we begin, it is in the aftermath of the monstrous encounter between the proverbial underdog and the established champ: Stallone's Rocky Balboa and Carl Weathers' Creed, fittingly named Apollo as he seemingly reigns down over all around him and within his field. They are treated for the previous night's injuries, and stay in a situation of hospitalisation in the same institute. Around them lie a flurry of fans and press personnel, Rocky's newfound fame seeing an array of autograph hunters desiring interactions with the guy and his name on a piece of paper. Rocky states there and then that he's retired from the sport, a knock-on affect which results in his brother-in-law, manager and close friend Paulie (Young) to veer away and back to the illegal way of life that plagued Rocky's prior existence. It is additionally a decision that, once out of the hospital, sees Rocky revert to what his previous status was before this overnight thrusting into stardom; that is to say, to remain steady with sweetheart Adrian (Shire) and garnering whatever work he can to pay for the expensive gifts and great deal of love he wishes to lavish upon her.<br/><br/>In spite of his victory, Creed happens to want a rematch for reasons that are later revealed to be much more personnel to him this time round than the initial entry's blind egotism, and we feel a little more for him here. Rocky goes on to engage Adrian; an instance instigated during a surreal happening at an open-plan zoo under six inches of snow, in which the lone wildlife occupant of the place appears to be a tiger prowling around in his den. As Rocky and Adrian turn to leave, marriage proposal successfully in-tow, we observe the tiger emblem on the back of Rocky's jacket and sync it up with how out of place the zoo's tiger appeared; the sentiment inferring Rocky as a man having turned his back on the boxing world to do labour work, whilst keeping himself out of the limelight, is prominent and he appears under this guise as out of sorts with the nature of this existence, just as the tiger in the snow appeared to.<br/><br/>We realise before Rocky that his spending ways cannot be supplemented by his meat stacking profession, nor his temperamental nature of trying to shoot TV adverts with equally temperamental directors. He realises coming back out of retirement is the only option, and we are weary of such a decision; weary of Creed's own apparent dedication to right-wrongs; weary of what Rocky has on the line to loose, specifically his sight in one eye and his family of Adrian as well as a newborn son whom arrives as the pressure cooker intensifies. We are weary of Rocky's own dedication, and whether he is genuinely transferring back to a life as a boxer once more out of fondness for the sport or if it is for a cash injection; made weary by his trainer Mickey's (Meredith) deduction, and it's a deduction we trust, that Creed will near-enough kill him if they were to fight again. It is a moment captured quite wonderfully by Stallone's positioning of his character in a doorway, as his trainer stands just outside and his wife on the stairs fearing for his health: the mind has been made up, and Rocky proceeds through the portal and back into his old world away from what's homely and safe. The film is not without merit; its final duel is constructed edifyingly, but its training montages are shot with too much intensity given the material, and the whole thing is too self-aware of its own core dramatics when a fourth-wall breaking telecast greets us ringside upon entry to the stadium – we are here, in this sequel, to see the fight and only the fight. Regardless, we're behind the characters enough to want them to succeed; Rocky himself states at one point that he'd be nothing and nowhere without the lovely Adrian – we'd be at a loss in backing him if he weren't."
"jboothmillard","6","0","3","26 March 2011"," Rocky II
","The first film was a huge success winning three Oscars, including Best Picture, and this first sequel in the series is supposedly the only one that can be recommended, directed by its star Sylvester Stallone. Basically the story continues where it left off, it seems that Rocky Balboa (Stallone) lost to World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) by a split decision made by the judges, and they both get treated for their injuries in the same hospital. Because he made so much money from the fight, Rocky gets married to Adrian (Talia Shire), buys an expensive sports car and a large new home, and starts filming some commercials to boost his fame a bit more, but failing to remember lines stops this happening. Embarraseed he starts working in a meat packing company along with Adrian's brother Paulie (Burt Young), while she goes back to her job in the pet store, while pregnant. He soon gets laid off and thinks he no longer has a future in boxing, announcing his apparent retirement, and starting a menial job helping his old trainer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) in his gym. Soon enough though Apollo sick and tired of taunts claiming that he didn't win fairly and that the fight was fixed is demanding a rematch to prove he is still the champion boxer to his opponent. Adrian is against Rocky going back in the ring, not just because he said he would stop, but because he gained an eye infection that doctors advised would get worse if he gets hit, damaging his eyesight, but fighting is all he can do. Lack of support from his wife affects Rocky, but he carries on, until after giving birth to their baby son Rocky Jr. when she falls into a coma, he stops training to stay by her side until she wakes. When she does wake, there is only one thing she wants her husband to do, win the fight against Apollo, and so continues the training, until it finally comes to the deciding match which he is determined to win this time. In the end, Adrian watching on TV while still recovering, and Mickey by his side to advise him, the fight begins and it seems he has got his spark back, he wins by knockout when they both fall, and he gets up a second before Apollo, becoming the new heavyweight champion of the world, and getting the gold belt. Also starring Tony Burton as Apollo's trainer Duke, Joe Spinell as Tony Gazzo, Sylvia Meals as Mary Anne Creed and Frank McRae as Meat Foreman. I should be saying that I assumed Rocky lost all his fights in the films, although saying that it explains a spoof I saw of Stallone on Bo! in the USA wore red gloves and a gold belt, so it was a good surprise for me. Anyway, Stallone still gives a credible performance, Shire is still good as his quite quiet wife, and Meredith is still fantastic with his Penguin style snarling or quacking and temper, there is another great montage with catchy music, and the fighting is gripping, the home life stuff's alright too, a worthwhile boxing drama sequel. Rocky Balboa was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and ""Yo, Adrian."" was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes. Good!"
"blacklist-1","9","0","2","7 September 2010"," An excellent sequel to the enthralling original. Rocky punch blasts his way through this.
","Rocky II I had the ultimate pleasure of viewing yesterday and I am pleased to say this was as excellent and exciting as the first one. This second part continues the story from the first one after Rocky's thrilling fight with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). It starts off with Rocky (Stallone) and Creed at hospital where Creed demands a rematch as his fans think the fight was fixed and that Creed has bought shame to his fans as he is sent hate-mail (later on in the movie), but Rocky refuses and his then girlfriend Adrian (Talia Shire) is relieved as Rocky refuses to continue his boxing. With the money he wins from fighting with Creed he and Adrian get married, get a new house, car and she falls pregnant but eventually Rocky ends up losing everything as he loses a contract to do a bunch of commercials and a job in the meat factory which he gets temporary. Meanwhile Creed demands a rematch to prove he can beat Rocky as he believes he was lucky as most people saw it as a draw or that Balboa was the winner. Eventually he agrees.<br/><br/>The story is different which makes it refreshing and it's a comfortable continuation of the story of Rocky and his wife. Stallone and Shire provide great performances and there are a couple of surprisingly touching moments. Even though when they get married it's a bit cheesy, it's sweet and cute in a way. Burt Young as Adrian's brother provides good support, but Burgess Meredith as Micky his coach gives an excellent performance pushing Rocky in his training to encourage him. The script is still formulaic from the first one, but it works and even though the character development of the main character's past dosen't go further, you still care about them.<br/><br/>This brings me onto the rematch between Rocky and Creed. It is brilliant. A very tense and atmospheric rematch, which gave me a buzz and had me cheering for Rocky. For me this fight was better than the first. I just got so caught up in it. This is a fantastic sequel and in the end I had a tear in my eye for happiness for Rocky as he wins. You end up rooting for him hugely in this. I now look forward to the third with more high expectations, which I will give my review on soon. Rocky rules!"
"aefrench","7","0","1","26 August 2010"," Good sequel
","""Rocky II"" is a nicely done film that continues the story of the one and only Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>The film starts immediately after Rocky and Apollo Creed's match. Both fighters are being sent to the hospital, where a pack of reporters are awaiting them. Rocky arrives first, and announces he is retired. Apollo comes in moments later, and wants a rematch. Despite the fact that Apollo won the match by split decision, he thinks Rocky's performance was a fluke. Rocky sees no reason to take part in a rematch, and the matter remains unsettled.<br/><br/>After he is fully healed, Rocky tries to adjust to life after boxing. He and Adrian get married, and she becomes pregnant soon after. However, Rocky quickly finds that retirement from the ring may not be the best option for him. Adrian is opposed to Rocky making a comeback. Rocky has an eye problem by this time, and she fears that he could go blind if he fights again. Mickey feels the same way, even testing Rocky's eyesight to show Rocky that fighting would not be a wise decision.<br/><br/>While Rocky contemplates resuming his boxing career, Apollo has not gotten over what happened in the first fight. Still wanting a rematch, he resorts to humiliating Rocky in the newspaper and on TV. Unable to take it anymore, Rocky decides to come out of retirement. Will Apollo win and prove he was right about Rocky, or will Rocky triumph this time around? Or will the two boxers fight to a draw? The film was written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, and he does well in both roles. Talia Shire is convincing as Adrian, Carl Weathers is perfect as Creed, Burt Young lends good support as Paulie, and Burgess Meredith is fun to watch as Mickey. I also enjoyed the film's score very much.<br/><br/>If you liked the first ""Rocky,"" you'll like this. It is worth watching."
"Aaron1375","7","0","1","7 March 2009"," And Apollo said he did not want a rematch.
","Of course, I find it understandable that he wanted one and he had the quick turn around from the first movie. As soon as that fight was over the media started hounding him and he knew the only way to exorcise the demons as it were was to destroy Rocky in the ring. So basically, we have Rocky getting endorsement deals and some cash from the fight in the last movie not really wanting to fight again as Apollo did a real number on one of his eyes that he is almost blind in it. Unfortunately, Rocky is not to good with commercials and the money starts to run out quickly. Take also into account that Adrien is pregnant, however she is opposed to him getting into the ring as well. Well this and that happens and Rocky agrees to the rematch and Mickey is once again training the Italian Stallion. Mickey also has a strategy, to protect the bad eye from further damage and to throw Apollo off his game he is going to make Rocky fight right handed, then when the timing is right let him revert back to being left handed to really throw Apollo. More stuff happens including the birth of Rocky's son and a close call with Adrien and then the fight is on. The fight is not quite as realistic as the first one as this time Apollo was prepared and he was the heavy weight champion of the world. He really should have leveled Rocky...however, that would not have made good cinema and the ending was pretty tense there for a bit."
"dobbin-4","7","0","1","16 May 2008"," Rocky 2: The 117th review
","This weekend I have submitted myself to watching all the 6 Rocky film in 3 days. This is my second review started at 5:30pm 16th May 2008.<br/><br/>The film is a bit seamy compared to the other one, but is well written and well acted out by characters that seem to beg out to be noticed and try to get another few dimensions to their character as possible before Rocky 3. The film is honestly an art on how to make sequels. Not TOO seamy but enough for the audience to remember why the first movie was a tribute to every movie ever made.<br/><br/>In this film, we see a retired Rocky struggling to find a job and having to deal with Apollo Creed badgering for a rematch after being embarrassed in their first fight. He then gets back into the ring to save his reputation and save his family.<br/><br/>The film is how all sequels should be made and certainly has the viewing feeling that the film was well worth watching and if films now day were as well thought out as this film there would be no problem with ideas in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is great to few and is a tribute to the first which was a tribute to all movies everywhere. I rate this film 72%."
"DKosty123","7","0","1","20 April 2008"," Sequel But A Little More
","The original film is a classic. This one actually goes beyond the classic and makes Rocky a Legend. The sad thing is that the ego of Stallone & others went so far that the series became like the Energizer bunny & keep going & going to oblivion.<br/><br/>This one, while not quite as strong as the original, does pick up the story logically & build to a fitting climax of the Balboa-Creed rematch. All the first films principals are here along with some new faces along for the ride.<br/><br/>The strengths of this film are the logical story of what success does to both boxers who are strong men but yet both weak in ways. The development is logical to the conclusion & Rocky winning this time is the fitting ending movie goers yearned for after the first film.<br/><br/>What is interesting and often forgotten now is the way both films tried to develop Apollo Creed to be a Muhammed Ali like type of boxer. One of the strengths of both films is having that type of character for Balboa to play off and Carl Weathers brings it off brilliantly. While Creed isn't exactly Ali, there is no doubt the real life Greatest had much to do with the success of the first 3 Rocky films in the box office, though the third one goes too far & loses too much of what the first 2 installments were all about."
"gcd70","6","0","3","30 January 2007"," Go Rocky!!!
","Sylvester Stallone returns just three years on as writer, director and star in the second of this hugely popular series. John G. Avildsen does not return to direct, and perhaps this film has suffered as a result.<br/><br/>This time ""Rocky"" gets another chance at the title in this sequel that does not live up to its predecessor. It really misses that down and out feel of the first film. The slow middle does not help, however Burgess Meredith and a well-constructed climactic fight do. Still quite good entertainment. It was also great to see the rest of the original cast returning, including Talia Shire, Burt Young and Carl Weathers, as well as Bill Conti's rousing score.

"Movie_Finder","8","0","1","5 February 2005"," Not disappointing at all
","Although most did seem to enjoy this movie, I have heard a lot of negative comments ranging from ""it's too unoriginal"" and ""predictable."" Also, the result of the end fight has been vilified by many. I think these comments are very unreasonable and too comparative with the first movie.<br/><br/>Yes, Rocky 2 does contain some rather tedious moments and perhaps some tiny plot holes, but for the most part it does not disappoint. One very strong element of this film - which even outshines the first one - is the end fight of the movie. I have heard many say it is not a ""fitting ending"" but I think it is with out a doubt the best battle out of any of the Rocky movies; the boxers really do go the distance.<br/><br/>If you are a big fan of the first Rocky movie only for its Oscar-winning elements then perhaps the movie may be a bit disappointing; however if you are like me and really appreciate a developing story line and good training/fight scenes or are really into the Rocky character, then you must go and see this movie, and the 2 that follow (Rocky 3 & 4). 7.5/10."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","0","1","9 July 2004"," Not as good as the first, but definitely a worthy sequel
","Like in my review of the first Rocky, I will point out right away that I am not a fan of boxing, in or out of movies, so my review will be based on the drama of the film, rather than the boxing. I really enjoyed the first Rocky, and it was obvious from the very first glance that it was not a boxing movie, but rather a drama that involved boxing, much like 8 Mile isn't a movie about rapping, but rather a drama that involves rapping. The sequel is the same thing, and I'm very glad that it is, since that allows non-boxing-fans like myself to enjoy it. The film picks up exactly where the first one left off, and follows the events of the first film directly. Personally, it felt a little like the plot was mainly made up to make a sequel to the first, but, hey, the film is good, almost as good as the first, so I'm not complaining. It just doesn't seem one hundred percent likely. The plot is good, about as good as the first. It takes off at the beginning, like the first, and remains interesting throughout the entire runtime. The acting and characters are just as good as they were in the first, as pretty much every one of them were in the first as well. The direction lacks a little, which the first didn't, probably due to Stallone taking over directing duties. One thing that bothered me a little was that the end boxing match seemed a little unrealistic, more than the one in the first Rocky, but, like I said, I'm no fan, so I don't know for sure if it is unrealistic. All in all, a worthy sequel to the first, and definitely worth watching for any fan of the first film. I recommend it to fans of the first Rocky, fans of dramas and possibly boxing fans in general. 7/10"

"vchimpanzee","Null","0","1","7 September 2003"," Pretty good, but until the second half, doesn't seem like the sequel to a classic
","At the beginning, Rocky Balboa has been badly beaten up by Apollo Creed. Both have been taken to the hospital.  Mickey thinks Rocky won the fight, and so do lots of fans.  But the judges said Apollo won, and Apollo wants a rematch.<br/><br/>Once he is out of the hospital, Rocky marries Adrian and starts spending money he doesn't really have.  He tries doing commercials but he isn't much of an actor.  Rocky also gets a job in a meat-packing plant, while Adrian, who is pregnant, goes to work in a pet store. Rocky is not pleased that he can't support his family himself, so he considers returning to boxing, even though he risks going blind in one eye, and he could still get hurt simply because of being unable to see well from that eye.  Meanwhile, Apollo hasn't given up on his challenge.<br/><br/>Before this movie I had only seen the fifth movie in the series.  I was beginning to think that one was going to be the better of the two, and surely this one wasn't going to come close to what I had heard about the original.  The second half definitely makes this movie work, though.  And Burgess Meredith and Carl Weathers gave good performances.  Sylvester Stallone is a better actor when he's not talking.  Throughout the whole movie he sounded like a comic impression of himself.  At least in V, he talked normally in one scene.<br/><br/>I liked the funny parts, such as the commercials, and his talking to a tiger at the zoo when he proposed to Adrian.  The second half was more exciting and had some sad moments as well.  Did Rocky fight again?  More importantly, did he win?  The Rocky of the first half was a joke, and I thought the answer was going to be obvious.  Not true.<br/><br/>This was a pretty good movie, and one of these days I have to see the original."

","Rocky II represents a decent enough follow-up to the original movie. The primary problem with it is its predictability. Rocky struggles to make a go of it without boxing, but we know from the very beginning that he's going to get back into the fight game. Otherwise, there's no movie. As in the first movie, the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed is magnificently choreographed (although - and I have this problem with the entire ""Rocky"" series - heavyweights just don't punch like that; at least not in any fight I've ever seen) but, again, the result is rather predictable (although how the result comes about is a bit of a surprise.) But one of the great things about the original was the unpredictability of the fight. Would Rocky win or lose? As I recall when I watched the original for the first time, I really didn't know. This time, you know. I mean, the result has to be the way it turns out.<br/><br/>The performances here are decent. Sylvester Stallone was born to play Rocky Balboa. There's no doubt about that. He puts on a believable enough portrayal of a frustrated ex-fighter, unable to make his way, with a wife who doesn't want him fighting. Carl Weathers provides a fuller look at Apollo Creed, battling his personal demons after the embarrassment of his disastrous first match with Rocky. Talia Shire was I thought weaker in this movie. Adrian came across to me as more window-dressing than substance, and Burgess Meredith continued to be the epitome of the gruff old trainer.<br/><br/>Predictability aside, I enjoyed the movie, although it was definitely not up to the standard of the original.<br/><br/>6/10."
