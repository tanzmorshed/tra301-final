","After watching this movie I can say that no it is not as good as the original but that does mean that it is a bad movie. What I was really excited to see in this movie from the trailers was the scares and the demon nun Valak. The movie does not disappoint and can't wait to see the next entry in the conjuring series!"
"mungflesh","8","206","282","2 June 2016"," An uncommonly strong sequel
","The Conjuring 2 doesn't waste time in bringing the scares in. By that, I mean you're pretty much in the thick of it from the get-go, being given some background (via another very notorious haunting incident) for what is to follow.<br/><br/>The Warrens are sent on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which is whipping up a media storm in Enfield, England and, as per the first movie, they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation. Once again, a family is being haunted and they fear for their sanity and lives. There are a few new twists this time round, so all does not play out as before - but it's not a complete departure from the format, which might have made it a bit more gripping in places.<br/><br/>James Wan's trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that.<br/><br/>What's really enjoyable about this movie, is its nostalgic recreation of 70s England. Wan has really done a great job of this, which is surprising given that he's not from there. Also, the central support role of Janet Hodgson is pretty crucial to empathising with the Enfield family and Madison Wolfe gives a solid performance.<br/><br/>It's arguable this one is as strong as the first. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed part one, or indeed likes movies of a haunting or possession theme.<br/><br/>Some awesome, unsettling and creepy music in places too."
"lnvicta","8","64","85","14 October 2016"," A rare horror sequel that delivers the same quality scares as its predecessor, courtesy of returning puppeteer James Wan.
","The Conjuring was a shocking horror film. It combined every creepy trope you can think of (ghosts, dolls, music boxes, mirrors, you name it), and it actually worked thanks to a genre-savvy director behind the curtains. James Wan has proved himself a capable producer on projects such as Saw and Insidious, and with The Conjuring, he cemented himself as a master of the genre. It had the perfect amalgam of horror tropes crafted in such a way that felt as fresh and spine-tingling as classic haunted house movies did in the '80s. The Conjuring 2 is another ""based on true events"" tale that has us follow expert paranormal investigators, the Warrens, this time solving the mystery of the Enfield Haunting. <br/><br/>Similar to the Amityville Haunting, the Enfield Haunting sees an English family plagued with a poltergeist that doesn't seem to enjoy the presence of anyone in the house. What The Conjuring 2 succeeds at is giving us both character development and another great story, which is exactly what a good sequel should do. The acting is uniformly great, but the true star of the film is James Wan. His shots are designed in a way to imbue dread and stir it around our heads for a while before hitting us with the scare. That's what true horror lacks these days, patience. The longer the anticipation is built and the more atmosphere is created, the more unsettling the situation becomes until it's like a ticking time bomb that you anxiously wait to go off. It uses familiar tropes, such as self-starting children's toys, slamming doors, and smashing furniture, but they're used as tools to mask the truly frightening fact that this family is up against something utterly beyond their control - they're hopeless, and we can feel it.<br/><br/>Mind you, The Conjuring 2 isn't without its faults. The runtime is a blatant offender. Pushing the 2-hour mark is never a good idea for a horror film, and some fat definitely could have been trimmed. There are a handful of cheap scares, audio scares to be precise - when the music gets extremely loud all of a sudden and you find yourself more annoyed than scared, quickly reaching for the remote to turn the volume down at the risk of enduring another ear drum shattering noise. It also doesn't feel as unique as its predecessor, understandably due to the very nature of sequels, but there are moments that drag on long enough to remind you that the first Conjuring didn't have these plodding plot points. For example, it takes about an hour for the Warrens to even get to England. Also, while in the haunted house, they're able to sleep through some horrifying sounds that would snap a bear right out of hibernation. But these dull spots and plot inconsistencies are few and far between.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is how a horror sequel should be done. It's slick, stylish, fun, and at times, quite terrifying. When a horror movie makes me want to turn on the lights as I go roaming around the house at night, I consider that a job well done. The Conjuring 2, well done."
"m-shellby","10","192","299","8 June 2016"," Wow!!
","Wow wow wow!! I've never been much of a fan of sequels but The Conjuring 2 was incredible. I'm never one to jump at everything 'scary' I see in movies as usually you've seen it all before & let's be honest, nothing really scares you much when your not a teenager anymore. However The Conjuring had me jumping all over the place. At one point I even yelped, much to my embarrassment, but that's why we go to horror movies! To be scared & the conjuring didn't disappoint. All actors gave amazing performances & the story had you never in a state of boredom. Walking out of the cinema I couldn't wait to see what The Conjuring 3 would bring! (Assuming we're lucky enough for another). Definitely a movie to see in the cinema. I give it 10/10!! Great movie!!"
"AgentDice","8","127","197","8 June 2016"," The Conjuring 2 is best when it sticks to the basics
","First, the all-important question: Is The Conjuring 2 scary? Like, jump out of your seat, watch through your outstretched fingers scary? The answer to that is ""yes."" Under James Wan's direction, even the most clichÃ©d haunted-house tropes (and this movie is bursting with them) are genuinely creepy, and although the movie isn't overly reliant on jump scares, the ones it does useâ€”well, they work. On a lizard-brain level, The Conjuring 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark, and some of its simplest momentsâ€”like a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlightâ€”are its most effective, bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and Don Burgess' gloomy cinematography.<br/><br/>Speaking of tropes, that's where the ""based on a true story"" bit comes in. The main plot of the film revolves around a real-life incident known as the Enfield Poltergeist, an extremely well-documented case of a supposed ghost who terrorized the Hodgson family of North London from 1977 to 1979 and was apparently a fan of the classics: knocking on walls, shaking beds, throwing furniture, and even the occasional haunted kid's toy. And as malevolent spirits often do, it picked on one of the children in particular, 11-year-old Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe). Call it a collective delusion, or a desperate cry for attention from a disturbed child. Or call it what the movie very explicitly calls it: The Devil.<br/><br/>With this installment, the Conjuring movies may have overtaken The Exorcist as the most Christian of horror franchises, taking place in a universe where the Catholic Church is the spiritual S.H.I.E.L.D. and demon hunters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) its holy roller super-agents. The film opens with the Warrens investigating the famous Amityville case, during the course of which Lorraine first encounters the hellish presence that will haunt her for the next few years. Fearing for his life, she begs her husband to suspend any future paranormal investigations, to which he reluctantly agrees. Until, that is, a priest arrives to give them their next mission: Travel to London and confirm the veracity of reports of a demonically tinged haunting.<br/><br/>Both Farmiga and Wilson are given their chance to shine in spooky set piecesâ€”Farmiga early on in the film, Wilson later. But while they're both convincing in spiritual warrior mode, Wan's decision to play up the romance between the two doesn't quite work. We knew that the Warrens were a happily married couple in the first movie, but having them each individually tell the story of their paranormal love and Ed make suggestive comments about the sleeping arrangements seems odd, maybe because they're flirting in front of a possessed pre-teen whose soul is currently in the process of being swallowed by the Pit. (On the other hand, this is just another day at the office for the Warrens.) The non-horror elements of the film are uneven in general: The score, so effective in the fright scenes, suddenly evokes eye rolls when things start to get sentimental, and there's one scene of unintentional comedy where the film's retro '70s settingâ€”another element downplayed in the first film but foregrounded hereâ€”collides with its demonic imagery in an honestly pretty silly way. (The Conjuring 2 shares its predecessor's eye for period details, some of which seem out-and-out ridiculous until they're juxtaposed with photos of their real-life counterparts in the end credits. The on-the-nose pop music gets no such redemption.) That being said, there are also some truly funny moments, like a shot of the Hodgson family running from their haunted house after a particularly intense bout of psychokinetic activity that riffs on smartasses' favorite retort, ""Why don't they just move?"" (And, for the record, they don't move because it's public housing, and the local council, which is naturally quite skeptical of the whole ""ghost"" thing, has to approve the relocation.) It's also worth noting that The Conjuring 2 is more than two hours long, allowing for lots of escalation. And while each individual haunting scene can be white-knuckle intense, by the dozenth or so such shock, the film starts to lose momentum. So the final confrontation, when it does come, is a relief in more ways than one. The long running time also allows Wan to overthink his demonology: The main villain, an infernal nun, is appropriately nightmarish, if reminiscent of the veiled ""Bride In Black"" from Wan's own Insidious. What's less compelling is the insertion of the ""Crooked Man,"" a storybook scarecrow monster that starts spreading Babadook-esque chaos about halfway through and is explained as the demon assuming a form that's familiar to the Hodgsons. Which would be fine, if it weren't for the two familiar forms that the spirit has taken already.<br/><br/>When The Conjuring 2 focuses its efforts on scaring the audience, it succeeds, wildly. And why wouldn't it? Wan's got his horror technique locked down at this point. It's the parts where it wanders away from the basics of creating and releasing tension that prevent it from outdoing its predecessor."
"sivretta","10","87","144","3 June 2016"," Great movie, better than the first one.
","I was really surprised about what an amazing job James Wan did with this sequel. From the very start it captures you and keeps you attached to the screen. There is no way you can get bored. I loved the suspense that goes increasing pretty quickly through the whole film, I could feel my heart in my ears beating faster as the atmosphere grew creeper and creeper. I enjoyed all the small details threw around such as the name of the demon that was showed in the Warren's house more than once in the background, leaving me with the question ""Why that word keeps being repeated? Nobody in that house has that name!"" only at the end I figured out what it meant. I absolutely adored the whole plot and the plot twist within. Make up and special effects were crazy, they made you get chills running down your spine. The soundtrack was impeccable, it played a big part in creating the right atmosphere. Few jump scares, very well situated, some of them very unpredictable. Didn't see a couple of them coming, at all. I found that Vera Farmiga was absolutely stunning with her performance in this movie. I loved the way Lorraine had her ""moment"" when stepping in to save her husband condemning the demonic entity back to hell. She was incredibly intense. Personally, I think Patrick Wilson did a better job in this movie compared to the first. I felt like Ed and his relationship with Lorraine was a lot more highlighted. I highly recommend this movie. If you are a fan of the paranormal you can't miss it."
"n-kefala","7","73","125","9 June 2016"," Clever enough to scare us
","""The Conjuring 2"" is an excellent example of what more sequels should aspire to be. It is a perfectly executed haunting movie from James Wan that dives deep below the surface to explore themes of vision, belief and faith. The family drama is still right at the center and is quite effective, and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent to their roles. The film doesn't give anything new at the horror movie genre, but its set pieces are often impressive, even if sometimes rely a bit on jump scares. The truth is that ""The Conjuring 2"" has enough suspense and story to have appeal for all kinds of horror fans and is a film clever enough to scare us. nikisreviews.com"
"jdogkg","9","67","114","14 June 2016"," Definitely scarier than the first!
","I was really counting on this movie to raise my scare level to the top, and if you haven't seen this movie, you have no idea what I am talking about! Oh my gosh, this film was freaking terrifying! For three years I was plagued with nightmares of the first movie, and i didn't think any movie could be more scary. Conjuring 2 definitely proved me wrong! Not only were there jump scares but REAL horror, not just being startled by a loud noise but James Wan shows us what real horror is. There were many rising suspense scenes and you have no idea what will happen. That is what scary is! Demons are what true scariness are. What lurks in the darkness is something to be terrified about. And this movie shows us this perfectly. Like I said it does have jump scares, and I appreciated that, why? BECAUSE NONE IF THEM ARE FALSE, they were not a cat jumping out or a character popping out, every single one was real and lived up to the rising suspense that was built up. Not only is it scary but it is an awesome story. As a matter of fact a TRUR STORY. It was very well told and unlike most horror movies today it actually had a PLOT. The twist in the end is brilliant, unpredictable and pieced together the plot elements well. Also greatly shot, greatly acted and great character development. Unlike most horror movies this has Likable CHARACTERS. Unlike most horror movies it's not a gore fest or has countless swear words, it's rated R JUST because of how SCARY it is. I love James Wan he is terrific at what he does. Every horror director now days NEEDS to see the insidious trilogy and of course the 2 conjuring movies. This has restored my faith in horror movies! I definitely recommend it. See it with your spouse, friends, girlfriend or boyfriend (definitely do not bring your kids) and you will have the thrill of a lifetime! By the way you might want to look under your bed tonight! ðŸ˜‰"

","The Conjuring 2 is directed by James Wan and stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. The Conjuring 2 is an excellent horror movie and just a flat out great movie in general. From the camera-work to the performances this movie delivers on all fronts. The plot follows a family in poverty in Einfield,England that start experiencing strange happenings in their home. After things become much worse over a period of time The Warrens are contacted to come and help. This is a very scary movie thanks to James Wan's direction from lingering and tracking shots he is truly a master behind the camera. The scares come quite often as scenes will linger and bring a huge sense of tension and get you when your not expecting it bringing some very frightening scenes. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilsons performances are excellent as you buy into their relationship and learn some lessons on marriage. The children actors have the be given credit too as they are great in this film. These kids are terrified of the haunting and you will feel their dread. I am so satisfied with this film generally people worry about horror sequels usually because they can turn out unsuccessful, but I am happy to report as a big fan of the first movie this is just as great."
"KhangNg19","10","99","182","8 June 2016"," Gerne-bending, ground-breaking and an absolute classic
","The thing about The Conjuring series is that it screams classic right at the first few scenes and just works its way up from there. While The Conjuring is definitely being remembered as one of the most excellent horror movies in decades, its sequel does even a better job by providing some extra well-done scenes that are not normally seen within the gerne. <br/><br/>But how about the scare part? Is it scary? Definitely yes. Don't bother comparing it to the first one. Just enjoy the movie and you will find yourself holding your breath until the very last moment. <br/><br/>Vera Farmiga was superb. Her presence was so strong, and powerful that she managed to pull the viewer through all kind of emotions. Patrick Wilson was also wonderful indeed. There are some subtle little hints about a sequel here and there in the movie. If those two continues to star (and also with James Wan), there is no doubt that it would be another masterpiece."
"ferna_oe","3","99","184","12 June 2016"," Genre saturation Showcase.
","Don't take me wrong. I did not hate The conjuring 2. It is an enjoyable film, in many terms. But I need to stress out, that this is one of the many films that have come lately, which is absolutely all about selling the product. The Hype. The anticipation. The goal of the producers lies 1 second after the ticket is sold, and not quite 1 second after the film is over. The conjuring 2 takes its context out of a very documented paranormal case which took place in England in 1977. It narrates the story of a family of 5, single mom, and 4 children, which are tormented by a spirit, and who eventually, get to be assisted by experts-in-these-topics Ed and Loraine Warren.<br/><br/>The premise might not be original at all, but it still works. The problem comes when such a premise is used at an attempt to pull off an over 2 hours long feature film. <br/><br/>About 30 minutes in, you will start to notice that this film is desperate. It is desperate to make you scared and live up to its own trailers and expectations. It might succeed on some (mostly children under 14 who sneaked inside the theater or whose irresponsible parents lied about their age at the ticket booth). But seasoned horror film enthusiasts will be able to anticipate almost every single jump-scare or even take a leap of faith and predict the outcome of a whole scene. Why? Because everything that happens in the conjuring 2, you have already seen or experienced in other films. This is the type of film you can watch with a notebook and start checking those clichÃ©s as they appear. The effort through which the writers struggled to come out with anything barely original or ""never seen"" before is noticeable, and every time they fail. Now considering this film is 110+min long, you will get tired quickly of hearing a loud noise, the a scream, and the some generic paranormal door slam, or furniture dash, because it happens a lot, and it get old a lot faster.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. It is not a trash film. Production values alone are worth the ticket. The film is beautifully filmed, in dark and ominous colors, and the house looks stunning even in almost 95% darkness. The music is interesting and tense, and the acting is top notch. (And the vile nun got myself quite convinced it was Marilyn Manson) But if you're there for the technical specs of it, you could have gone to other place to watch Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>It saddens me a little, to be witness of the decadence of the horror genre. Where most of the production money goes towards jump-scare roller-coaster rides like this one. The recipe for box office success was found, and they just keep making the same cake with different glazing. You will probably notice that before the film even starts, when you see that 4 trailers, and then you cannot make the difference between the 4 generic horror movies you've been shown. Probably you won't even be able to recall the names of the films. Because it doesn't matter. 3 stars. Enjoyable overall, but terribly generic."
"arungeorge13","5","7","9","6 June 2017"," Review - The Conjuring 2 (2016)
","For someone who loved the old-school horror vibe of The Conjuring, the sequel is barely memorable. It's not about the performances. It's not about the grim atmosphere. It's not about the cinematography, editing or direction. It's just that, after a pretty decent start, it loses steam big time towards the middle, and the viewer is left with little to care, when things start to make more sense towards the end. The way in which this whole saga transpired is what disappointed me, as a viewer.<br/><br/>The first instalment definitely towers over the sequel in almost every way. Much to the dismay of the viewer, the storyline itself seems like a toned-down rehash of their Rhode Island adventure from the first film. This time, the setting is Enfield, North London. Peggy Hodgson, a single mother of four seems to be experiencing the paranormal and the Warrens are called in to help. Lorraine seems to be undergoing some sort of psychological turmoil, after the couple had dealt with the Amityville Haunting (the scenes of which are shown in the initial part of the movie). She seems to have this recurring vision of a Demon Nun haunting her and trying to harm her husband.<br/><br/>Much like the sequels in another series by James Wan, Insidious, this one too starts on a promising note. The first seance is well- executed and brings goosebumps for old-school horror junkies. The Demon Nun seemed good for a terrifyingly scary villain. Later, the scene shifts to England where we are introduced to the Hodgsons and a few scenes in the night involving the kids mostly waking to loud thuds, frightening noises, and toys moving by themselves. The jump- scares are decent, but they lack innovation. They are very straight- forward, in the sense, the viewer is able to predict exactly when they are going to happen.<br/><br/>A few fright-nights later, one of the kids, Janet, shows signs that she is possessed by a spirit of an old man who used to own the house they live in, and finally the Warrens stop by. The scares are surprisingly low in the mid-portions and this is where the film falters in engrossing the viewer. The old man's spirit is somewhat akin to the Freddy Krueger character. His presence might pose as a viable threat for a scene or two, but definitely not for a stretch lasting more than 45 minutes. Plus, more than just ghastly makeup effects, James Wan chooses to take the mechanical route and wants the viewer to ingest the paranormal existence the same way the kids in the film do. Unfortunately, that R-rating will make sure only adults see the film and I'm pretty confident when I say that many of us will find this mid-segment (or let's say the connecting piece), downright dull.<br/><br/>The scenes involving the Demon Nun are highly intriguing as well as disconcerting, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed these bits. Much like the Lipstick-Face Demon from Insidious (2010), the Demon Nun possesses that X-factor fit for a daunting antagonist persona, gelling with the mood of the film perfectly. I was hoping to catch more petrifying scenes that showcased the Demon Nun's presence but sadly, the entity disappears midway only to show up at the climax (as a supposed big twist, meh!). James Wan and his cinematographer Don Burgess try their best to juggle perspectives and angles inside the minimalist haunted-house setup. Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) continue to appear an endearing couple plagued by the paranormal and their on-screen chemistry is splendidly portrayed. However, they could have benefited from a more revised screenplay that consistently maintained an unsettling vibe. The twins Chad & Carey Hayes, and James Wan himself contributed to the screenplay, apart from a later rewrite from David Leslie Johnson.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, there is not a single scene in this film that sends chills down our spine such as the 'hide-and-seek-clap' sequence from the first film. A possessed Lili Taylor was much more intimidating than a possessed Madison Wolfe. The Perrons from Rhode Island warranted more attention than the Hodgsons from Enfield. Who knows, the Crooked Man toy may get even its own film, similar to Annabelle. For now, I am just gonna cling on to the first film and sincerely hope James Wan scores a winner the next time around."

"FelipeCarrillo","10","82","160","9 June 2016"," ""The Conjuring 2"" Is Equivalent To Its Predecessor, Diabolically Creepy
","James Wan is the genuine Sir Alfred Hitchcock of the 21st century<br/><br/>Three years ago, the world went crazy with the 5th invention of the Malay director, James Wan - my king, master and role model -. ""The Conjuring"" triumphs in critics and box office bringing a breakthrough and resurgence to horror movies in the last decade, it was compared with classics like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" and is considered as the master jewel of Malayan and the cinematographic of horror. Wan has continuously been providing us great achievements in commercial films, since his major debut as a director with ""Saw"" in 2004 to his first action film ""7 Furious"" last year; his shiny and original style to portray suspense and horror through each frame, has made to the director reaches to the top of podium of the films, not only in the horror genre, also the action genre, and we hope more he'll try to experiment. <br/><br/>""The Conjuring 2"" opens the same iconic way that its predecessor, now is the famous case of Amityville (112 Ocean Avenue) which reveals to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the renowned paranormal investigators duo. Amityville was the event that gave them renown and recognition to investigators, but not by their horrible experiences, but by unbelief and ignorance of the people, which didn't believe it possible that those things happen. Later, within the film, we continue to validating in a 90s TV Show lack of confidence and credibility of the people towards the Warrens. Ironically, that skepticism would be powered once more with the Enfield Poltergeist, the case more documented to paranormal level. The famous massacre (DeFeo family) has been adapted millions and millions of times a big screen, however, Wan manages to save that gloomy essence of the night of the murder and projects it of a delirious and disturbing way in Lorraine's head, from the first minutes, ""HORROR"" genre shines.<br/><br/>The Enfield Case is adapted with purity and splendor of a script credited to Carey Hayes and Chad Hayes & James Wan and David Leslie Johnson. Wan dodges references of the two small programs have focused on the event (BBC's ""Ghostwatch"" and Timothy Spall's miniseries) to develop to Ed and Lorraine in the story (in real life, Warrens had not the least significance in the case, they only evidenced it one night). The film takes its time - somebody says that enough, I for one, the more see James's delights more I go crazy - to introduces the destabilized life of Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor). The events happened in a interval between 1977 and 1979, to capture each sublime moment of the epoch, it was vital the intervention of the Department of costume led by Kristin Burke, the Department of light and art led by Fiona Gavin, A. Todd Holland and Andrew Rothschild, which not exaggerated in capturing the atmosphere of the 70s and 80s. Wan is amazing to recreate complex and refined milieus and sets, every shadow, square, furniture, door, toy and even each color play a fundamental role in the creation of the style of the director, a director who is delicately precise with his details, even though was a humble house, without many luxuries or support tools, the visual tension is concurrent.<br/><br/>On a night as any, Hodgson family is sleeping peacefully after a tiring day. Two of the four children, Janet (Madison Wolfe) and Margaret (Lauren Esposito) are awakened abruptly from their nap by an unknown entity, immediately, they go to tell what happened them to her mother, who refuses to believe and finds an Ouija board manually made by her daughters. Next day, harassment persist more sharply up to the point that the mother experiences with her own eyes paranormal events - James's interesting proposal to not to fall into the clichÃ© that nobody believes them. Meanwhile, a suggestive sub-plot takes place in Warren family. Lorraine tends to keep fragments of each case and in their latest investigations, she sees to the Demon Nun (Bonnie Aarons), a superb and shocking demonic nun who torments them with a sinister intent, that purpose will intertwine of a sumptuous way with Hodgson's ending (which never happened).<br/><br/>Wan knows how to distort every trick in his favor, rung by rung construction makes that final climax has really earned. Wan is distinguished by the ability to frighten or intimidate the audience with shots both day as at night, he knows play and combine the tools that possesses, knows to keep constant tone of his film, he doesn't allow his audience to sleep, and even though this time he uses to more jump-scares than its predecessor, are equally enjoyable and are not shamelessly used. All of the above is essential in the foundations, however, the actors take all the credit Ed, Lorraine, Peggy and her four children (especially Janet) are fabulous, measured and charismatic.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring 2"" is credited with the title ""Horror film of the year"" and is used for viewing the constant advancement of its director within the genre, it's hard to watch and hear, the film is not suitable for hearts or minds weak, ""The Conjuring 2"" an instant classic."
"reid-hawk","3","46","88","1 July 2016"," definitely not the ""masterpiece/modern classic"" it has been hyped up to be
","This is going to be less of a review and more of a rant, so let me get the good parts of the movie out of the way. It's competently acted, and there isn't a bad child actor in the bunch. It's also pretty well shot, with James Wan using long shots where the camera floats around and through windows and walls, giving it a feeling of omnipotence. Now for the bad.<br/><br/>The intro is god awful. I'm not exaggerating when I say it made my entire theater erupt in laughter as Lorraine Warren pulled out in invisible shotgun to murder a family in a sort of dream-sequence. This accompanied by the fact that her hands are sped up every time she pulls the lever back to reload turn an intentionally ""intense"" introduction into a self-parody. <br/><br/>Next, this movie's CGI is also god awful. They were so lazy with so many parts that it's almost unbelievable how this movie has been made out to be a masterpiece by so many people. Instead of using a prop cigarette that produces smoke they said ""f**k it"" and just made crappy CG smoke. Instead of using machines to produce fake snow or create realistic rain effects the crew must have decided that was gonna take too much effort so they instead just CG'd the rain and snow effects. And they aren't even good CG like in the fast and furious movies that Wan does. It's like he decided his VFX and FX crews should be made up of entirely by monkeys with down-syndrome. The 2spooky4me memelord skelingtons in this movie don't look any better. The possessed girl (yeah I'll get to the clichÃ©s of the story later) is completely CG, including her fake face veins and Sh**ty cat-monster eyes, and the evil nun demon monster that makes no sense has a Cg mouth tentacle thing that looks straight out of the resident evil movies that shouldn't be getting made anymore. But the icing on this @ss flavored cake is the amazing idea to put the skeleton from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" in this movie, complete with the wonky frame rate that comes with claymation that makes things look like they aren't really moving right. It doesn't make sense on an artistic level (cause it isn't F!^&%%!%^@CKing scary!), and even less sense in a real life level. The dog literally transforms into the monster in front of a little boys very eyes. Like if it has this power why did it decide to use it only right there and never again. That's probably more useful than just about every other monsters' power in this movie, yet it just decides to do it once and only for the spooks cause lol this movie is so scary right guys gosh James Wan u master of horror u. ALso CGI tree spikes killing major characters in hallucinations is definitely 100% super intense not fake looking at all gr8 job m8 8/8.<br/><br/>OK for my favorite part, the story. It. Doesn't. Make. F**king. Sense....... Like I've seen so many message boards trying to understand certain motivations and all I can think is ""guys. No one writing this movie gave a sh!t. There is no explanation..."". So first off the main antagonist is valak or whatever and he can only be defeated by finding out then saying his name yadda yadda yadda clichÃ© clichÃ© clichÃ© sure whatever. Now this nun monster valak enters the movie in physical form to terrorize Lorraine Warren once in her little spirit world, and once inside her house (btw the house scene, this movies so-called ""scariest scene of the decade"", is absolutely retarded. the demon literally grabs a picture, uses it as a face, and runs at Lorraine while both its hands are still holding the picture. It looks like those kids that try to do Naruto ninja running because their parents don't love them). Now you might be saying, why does she do that? Well wouldn't you know it, the house the Warrens investigate just so happens to be terrorized by Valak. So Valak must have been f@cking with Lorraine to try and draw her and her husband to the house right? Except as soon as they get to the house the demon tries to make it look like the family is faking everything, and therefore tries and almost succeeds in making the paranormal investigators leave. What was the point in haunting Lorraine then? If it wasn't to draw her to the house the only explanation can be just to scare the audience. In fact drawing them to the house only leads to the demon being defeated. There is absolutely no reason Lorraine should be seeing this ghost unless it is through some kind of ghost world logic that the movie never explains. If that is true then it's pretty f*&#*cking stupid to not explain a major lore/plot element like that to the audience once... God this movie makes me want to jump off the roof of my house more than everyday life already does so i rate it 3/10 don't see it unless you want cancer I hope somebody actually reads this big wall- of-text review"
"Brandon_Walker_Robinson","7","30","57","7 June 2016"," A sequel deserving of being made
","For the most part, I came out with a positive vibe with the film. Production-wise, I thought it was exceptionally well done, and coming off the original one I can definitely say this held its own very well. Sequels have this innate ability to overdo what the previous installment did, and one might say this did it in some sense, but for the most part it played with a dialed-back approach. I mean look, what am I supposed to say about a film that is supposedly based on a true story? Sure, they will take their liberties here and there regarding what to make happen and how, but if they say it happened what am I to do in telling them they're doing what happened wrong or overly much? It was the right amount of ""more done.""<br/><br/>In my opinion alone (which will not be consistent with everybody here), the first hour was terrifying (depends on what one considers scary). The crowd interacted with the film appropriately, and the actors on screen did their due diligence to make you fearful for their well-being. Pacing-wise, the second hour took a strange turn. I was fine with what they did by creating more of a slow-burn effect to build up to a large climax, but considering there wasn't much to be considered scary in the second hour, it kind of felt like we got slow-burn for nothing (the end punch was fine, just not nearly as frightening as anything in the first hour is all). I can't really explain it. That's okay I guess, but I'm sure this film ran over two hours long, and I think the most appropriate cut would have been about right at two hours. I was only slightly fatigued by the end of it all.<br/><br/>James Wan has a terrific eye for the horror genre, and likes to display an array of emotions in his films, especially comedy where needed. Nothing slapstick at all, just the perfect blend of realism like ""This is how a person acts in real life,"" something that Christopher Nolan has never been able to do himself. The characters aren't just pieces to tell a larger story, they are the story. Patrick Wilson is silently one of my favorite actors, often taking the non-blockbuster role but still holding his own in a natural way. I have only seen Vera Farmiga in a few films now (The Departed, Orphan, Up in the Air, Source Code, Safe House, and The Conjuring), and with every scene she is in, she just encapsulates me. I would love to sit down and have a dinner conversation with her, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film I'd say this resorted with a few more jump scares, but I'm going to credit Wan for not cheapening them and doing them where they fit (no kids scaring each other, etc). This film did not play with the ""less is more"" mantra as much as the first film though, but like I said I'll go with that in a sequel. The first one also had much more even pacing and left with the right amount of questions unanswered; not to be unfair with this, but I also ""believe"" the story of the first film more than this one (only regarding what was seen on the screen). However, in The Conjuring 2 I cared more about this family, and I think the tension was equally as good in this film, save the night scenes being just a little too well-lit for my taste. I'd say I might like the first one just a little bit more, at least in that I own the first one on Blu-ray and I don't know if I need this one immediately. <br/><br/>Oh, and just be aware that the official trailer reveals way too much. I'm not even talking about jump scare material (which it does overdo), but I mean story material. Avoid please! Watch the teaser trailer instead, that one is perfect and reveals nothing substantial. Also make sure you stay for the first billing credits sequence at the end of the movie just because of how well it is crafted, as was the film itself! If only they cut out 10 minutes and maybe even $10 million in the budget, I think it would have served its purpose a little more appropriately. Unlike Sinister 2 though, this film didn't disappoint in the slightest."
"nickijjohnson","4","8","12","17 August 2016"," There should have only been The Conjuring
","First I have to say I had difficulty trying to figure out why the first one was so much better but I think I have some theories. I feel the family in the first film was more likable probably for reasons that seem wrong. The family in the first film was more traditional. They were a two parent household with a dog and probably easier for me to relate to as an American because they were American. The family in the second one is British and run by a single mother who at the start doesn't seem to be the best mother but then again she had her moments; I.E buying biscuits for her son instead of cigarettes.<br/><br/>The first one had more unpredictable scares and more genuine scares. In this one it seemed as though there were times when James Wan was like ""oh yeah we gotta throw in a scare"". The firetruck rolling into the tent and then back out was so predictable it was borderline boring. Also in the first one you found out how much evil had happened on the family's land whereas in this one it just seemed as though the little girl was possessed by an old man for most of the movie and at times it got old. When the dog ringing the bell stood up and became the man from their toy I practically laughed at the stupidity of it. It just seemed random and unnecessary. Of course with these stories it's always hard to tell what's for the movie and what actually happened seeing as how they're ""true stories"". I would bet the majority of what you see in these films is rubbish as the Brits say. <br/><br/>Also the house in this film is so dark and so dilapidated it looks like it's condemned. Lest we forget all the scariest moments were seen on the preview thus making them not effectively scary in the film. <br/><br/>Though what I did like about the film was the tribute to Ed and Lorraine Warren who I think were very brave, good people who truly did want to help people. They seemed like very down to earth people despite their occupation and also seemed to be very in love and made for each other which was beautiful to watch. I also liked that they touched on the Amityville investigation which is probably the most popular investigation they ever did. However I think this film like most sequels was not necessary and tried too hard to top the original but in my opinion fell short and I even found myself dozing off here and there. <br/><br/>I think Lights out will be the scariest film of the year so in comparison this was just a horror film that falls on the pile of mediocre films such as The Boy and The Forrest."
"feakes","10","38","76","12 June 2016"," something wicked this way comes
","The first conjuring was scary tense and original. It scared you when you least expected it and it scared you even when you expected it. the sequel However is the first time a horror movie ever gave me Goose bumps. Never has a movie ever given me goosebumps.Does that tell you something ? the direction is top rate and the acting is solid. The pacing is superb as the director lets the story unfold at it's own pace. Like the first movie. The conjuring 2 borrows from the real life case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren two real life Ghost hunters that had a knack for getting the truth out. The Film opens up in the famous Amityville Horror house and goes from that investigation which Lorraine said the evil in that house is as close to Hell as she ever wanted to get. Then the story moves to England and the house of a normal family named Hodgson and the stark horror that awaited them, The Enfield Haunting as it came to be known has the distinction of being one of the most documented cases in the area of the paranormal. Things occurred there that no one can explain. From Cops to Paranormal scientists no one could explain how it was done from scratching inside the walls to the Young girl named Janet being tortured and speaking in voices. Of course there is the people that tried hard to disprove it and only muddled the waters further. When the attacks intensify and the Catholic Church is brought into it the Church sends in Ed and Lorraine to investigate Not to get involved just observe. Lorraine is plagued by fear that if they do get involved it'll mean Ed's death. but from the moment they get there things escalate to the point that the warrens realize they can't just sit back and observe. there is danger here and Janet is targeted for death by the vengeful spirit.And so begins a struggle to find out just what it is they're dealing with a ghost Demon or hoax. That struggle is going to lead the warrens to the edge of despair and it might cost them dearly in the end.<br/><br/>the Story is based on true events. But like the conjuring the conjuring 2 is based on the fact that the warrens investigated the haunting. they never solved it. They never had epic battles like the films suggested. but that's reality and we are looking for entertainment and as entertainment this is entertainment of the finest kind. Best money you'll ever spend at the movies this year. and best money you'll send renting or buying the DVD. In other Words Go see it."

","(MAYBE SPOILER IN REVIEW)<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is one of the best movie sequels I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of sequels. I loved the first one and when I found out about the 2nd one I thought, ""Yeah I don't know, most likely going to be really bad."" Then I saw the trailer and thought"" Hmmm this doesn't look half bad."" Then I finally got to see it tonight and I couldn't believe how amazed I was at it! It was scary, suspenseful and jumpy. One thing I loved about it is that they get straight into the action, they don't wait 20 minutes to scare the living hell out of you. They like to throw in a jump-scare 2-3 minutes into the film. They don't add some crappy, boring, 20-minute introduction scene know one cares to see. It's BOOM into it."
"Trollwrestler","9","21","39","7 June 2016"," Good horror movie but it's more than just horror
","I was a fan of the first movie and a big fan of all of James Wans horror movies. I love his unique skill of creating tension and keeping you on your toes. But I feel like he has taken big steps to becoming one of the best directors there is.<br/><br/>The movie itself has pretty similar structure than the first one. That is not a bad thing though. It has some good scares and nice tension, like a horror movie should. But the cinematography and the quality of directing in the movie kind of surprised me. The movie looked really beautiful and and it's something that I personally appreciate a lot. <br/><br/>The characters in the movie were very likable. For a horror movie it's very important to be able to care for the characters. I think that is something that separates good horror from bad. Their relationships were well written and the actors did a really good job. I especially liked Patrick Wilson. I have always liked him but after seeing this I like him even more. <br/><br/>In the middle of all the horror and frustration of the nasty situation the family had, there was a really beautiful scene that actually made me emotional. It's pretty rare when watching a horror movie.<br/><br/>I think the movie was just really well made. Horror movies used to be low budget and low effort films in the past. Nowadays some are made with great talent and effort. It's not just good horror movie. It has heart and style and great acting. The very ending of the film made me give it 9/10 instead of 10/10. But can recommend this to anyone who likes horror or just appreciates movies."
"thebogofeternalstench","1","56","124","17 June 2016"," James Wan fails yet again
","James Wan is creatively bankrupt, and grossly over rated. <br/><br/>I went to see The Conjuring 2 today with a friend and I was completely fed up by the end.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a blatant marketing pitch for what I'm guessing is going to be 'The Conjuring 3'. Why else introduce the Amityville Horror at the beginning which has absolutely nothing to do with the Enfield Poltergeist? It's just so James Wan can keep milking his franchise like he did with The Conjuring 1 with Annabelle, and the god awful Insidious series etc. Either that or they will make a spin off featuring Marilyn Manson in a nuns outfit.<br/><br/>So then the film shifts to London, with a cringe-worthy attempt of signifying that we are now in London by playing London Calling by The Clash. Cue stock footage of very British things and blah blah blah we are in a school playground where we meet Janet and then its over to her house to meet her caricature mother. The mother who has the most fake sounding cockney accent you will ever hear. In England we refer to it as 'mockney'. It's so over done and put on you wonder why Wan didn't just hire an actress from Eastenders. The acting may have been worse but at least you'd have more of a real sounding London accent. That scene where she goes into the basement of the house with a mate to mess about with the washing machine, I felt like I was watching a live London stage show. Where the actors over do the acting and accent.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I wasn't the only one in the cinema who laughed out loud at the actor playing Maurice Grosse. Another awful, awful representation of a real person. His moustache and hair looked glued on and again was nothing more than a hilarious caricature. Most of the extras in this movie (people playing the police etc) had no fluidity at all, just a stale rigid performance devoid of anything you could relate to real people.<br/><br/>Every 'scary' scene is a loud bass thump accompanied by a jump scare. This is the extent of James Wans creative vision. Mind you, I will give him credit for the chair scene where Janet is blurred out in the background and old Bill comes for a chat with Patrick Wilson. You can see bills face form slowly as he talks. Thats as good as the film got.<br/><br/>There was no tension, no atmosphere, nothing. The inside of the house was HUGE for a London council flat. Flats like that are tiny in reality.<br/><br/>And the demons great plan for Mr Warrens demise was to make him fall from the top window and impale him on a sharp tree branch below? LOL. Come on Wan, this is something a child would come up with.<br/><br/>The film got silly at many points, especially that cgi demon that came out of the dog. Just degraded the movie further and was comical more than anything.The first time BIll speaks through Janet when the press are there in the living room just sounded ridiculous.<br/><br/>Again, the use of religion to combat the evil just got on my nerves. Apparently Ed Warrens cross on his necklace warded off evil spirits but Janets room full of crucifixes on the wall did diddly squat. Any one else getting fed up to the back teeth of good vs evil involving religion? The acting was adequate enough but Madison Wolfe makes no impression what so ever. The other child actors were good enough I suppose.<br/><br/>There's nothing here you haven't seen before. James Wan uses the same old tedious, trite tricks and just copy and pastes from his other movies, with the exception of a differently arranged type of jump scare etc. He lacks vision and creativity. All he is, is a commercially viable hack making watered down 'horror' for the lowest common denominator. Generation 'apphole' will eat this crap up like its the best thing 'evaaaa' and hail Wan as a movie making god.<br/><br/>The emperor has no clothes."
"abuzarov","1","49","109","28 June 2016"," Cheap and full of stupid clichÃ©s
","Seriously, I don't understand why this movie got such a high rating on IMDb (7.9 at this moment).<br/><br/>First. The whole thing is boring and predictable. And come on, it doesn't take much skill to scare a viewer with a sudden and loud shriek, accompanied by some puppet jumping into the screen. And they do that in the movie all the time, they do it a lot. And this is very low class for a horror movie, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Second. The music and sound effects. They serve just one purpose here - to teach the stupid spectator how to react at certain moments. Like ""look, if you didn't notice, it's a really tender family moment, say 'awww, how sweet'"", ""and here it's ominous"". Come on, we're not that stupid! We don't need THAT many hints! <br/><br/>Third. There's a lot of clichÃ©s. I mean it. Wind-up toy truck moving on it's own - how original! Then some vintage-looking toy with spooky pictures that come alive, then happy children's lough in the distance, then some background cathedral singing, then scary faces that only show in the mirror, then low-frequency growling - I can go on and on. It's boring. I know I've said earlier, but it really is.<br/><br/>But what got me the most, is that the creators of the movie exploit that ""based on true events"" line, and they are quite shameless on that. It's NOT based on true events in the full sense of this word. It's based on the STORY which is told by a couple of very successful hoaxers. <br/><br/>And the main female character - her acting was all about delivering just one image, it was all about that look on her face: ""ah, I'm so enlightened, I posses hidden wisdom, I pity you, stupid hectic humankind""<br/><br/>Not a good movie. Just a bunch of old and cheap tricks."
"andmcq","5","8","13","1 June 2018"," Disappointing sequel
","I was hoping that the sequel would improve on the 2013 original. Sadly, this is not the case. The Conjuring 2 follows a very similar structure to that of the original, but where the original avoided most problems that plague other horrors films, the sequel stumbles onto most of them.<br/><br/>The sequel makes two significant errors. Poor child actors and revealing far too much about the spooky entity. The first error, poor child actors, was avoided entirely by the original. The second, inexplicably, has the least capable child actor's character (Billy) stutter throughout the film. Completely unnatural and an unnecessary burden on the actor (and audience). B-B-Biscuits? (were the biscuits haunted?).<br/><br/>The second error, turns the film into somewhat of a comedy at times. We learn far too much about the deceased old man. ""My house"" always cracks me up, surely that's not meant to be scary? <br/><br/>Hoping the third movie is better."
"seige-hound","8","33","71","3 June 2016"," A great horror sequel, not as good as the first
","The Conjuring 2 is a period piece horror film that continues the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two demonologists who are most well known for their investigations into the Amityville haunting. The first film was set before Amityville and concerned one of their lesser known cases. This film is set after Amityville, and mainly concerns the Enfield Poltergeist.<br/><br/>The films obviously take a lot of liberties to what *actually* happened. Let's just say that this film is set in an alternate reality where every investigation the Warren family looks into is entirely true. If anyone looks into the actual footage and evidence in the case, it seems to be a pretty elaborate hoax, but in this film, it isn't.<br/><br/>That being said, this is an incredibly effective horror film, and some moments definitely caused me to feel incredibly anxious, and I frequently felt the need to push against the seat to get as far away from the screen as possible. The family is incredibly charming and likable, and the acting, especially the main girl character, I found to be quite impressive. There is also a carryover story from the first film concerning the Warren family, as they question the reason why they do what they do.<br/><br/>There were some cheesy moments throughout the film that distracted me a little. Some weird and out of place editing choices and other minor stuff. There is an over reliance of CGI in a few scenes that I found distracting. CGI, especially when it's CGI characters, are incredibly hard to make scary, and this film is no exception. However, for the most part this issue is avoided in favour of more traditional methods of scaring the audience.<br/><br/>Overall a quality film that is definitely worth watching if you liked the first film. It's not a better film than the first, but there isn't a massive drop in quality that occasionally occurs in sequels."
"donquixotewillbe","6","12","22","19 June 2016"," Jump Scares and very little else
","Being a huge fan of the horror genre, one must be disappointed with the quality of movies being churned out by ""Hollywood"" in the last 4-5 years. Conjuring was one of the exceptions, albeit partially. It managed an effective combination of jump scares and build-up. I, for one, love the horror genre, not for the former but the latter. Extensive experience in this genre has trained us well on the wheres, hows and whats and hence, build-up is what should matter most.<br/><br/>It is extremely disappointing to see the extent to which jump scares were employed by the makers having established themselves in the 'true story' mould with the first movie. They even aped camera angles adopted in the documentaries on the Enfield haunting, for crying out loud!<br/><br/>I was distraught when I read somewhere that the nun sequences were added as an afterthought. Wonder if the movie would have been better without these scenes?!<br/><br/>The Elvis part, bad. The climax, worse. The unwanted VFX, worst.<br/><br/>Hoping for a better 'true story' with the next installment."

It bothers me almost as much as the Exorcist does. I don't even like to watch it at night. The feeling of dread in that movie is heavy. In the sequel, my patience was challenged a bit. It plays out like a sampler of far better films such as Poltergeist and The Evil Dead. It's fun for what it is: a popcorn movie. If you enjoy fun ghost movies, see this one. If you're expecting a movie on the level of the first Conjuring, you may find yourself a bit disappointed."

"Danusha_Goska","4","14","28","26 June 2016"," Un-Scary Schlock
","I'm easily frightened by movies. I've never been able to get through Disney's ""Pinocchio."" ""The Conjuring 2"" is one of the least scary movies I've ever seen. I laughed out loud several times. I thought it was so ridiculous, heavy-handed, absurd, over-the-top. <br/><br/>I was actually scared during one scene. Patrick Wilson, as paranormal investigator and allegedly Catholic anti-demon commando Ed Warren, wades into standing water underneath a suburban home. Everyone knows anyone who wades into standing water in a domestic setting risks being electrocuted. Alas, the only menace Warren faces is the cardboard outline of a standard-issue specter who rolls up behind him. Boo! <br/><br/>The other scary factor: how old Franka Potente, who plays paranormal investigator Anita Gregory, has gotten. Back in 1998's ""Run Lola Run"" Potente was the embodiment of youth. Now  she's in her forties. Scary. <br/><br/>I honestly don't know what filmmaker James Wan was trying to achieve. Was he really trying to make a scary movie, or was he trying to make a meta-commentary on how schlocky scary movies can be? I hope the latter, because that is what he has achieved. The saving grace of the film is the presence of Vera Farmiga, an actress who deserves so much better than this, but who shines like sterling amidst the dross. <br/><br/>""The Conjuring 2,"" just like the original ""The Conjuring,"" is based on an allegedly true story. In 1977, in Enfield, England, two sisters, 11 and 13, claimed to be experiencing demonic possession. They were the child of a single mother and lived in a council house, that is a government welfare house. There was video footage proving that one of the girls was faking. <br/><br/>Never fear. Ed and Lorraine Warren, an American couple who sold themselves as real live paranormal investigators and exorcists, showed up. <br/><br/>""The Conjuring 2"" wallows in 1970s nostalgia. That there even is such a thing as ""70s nostalgia"" is evidence of the demonic. The men all wear wide lapels and wolfman sideburns. There is a lot of emphasis on retro tech, like bulky reel to reel tape recorders – the kind that actually could capture Satan's voice, whereas today's hand-held digital devices just don't pack the same punch. <br/><br/>There is a loooong pointless scene where Patrick Wilson, as Ed Warren, treats the possessed children to an imitation of Elvis Presley singing ""I Can't Help Falling In Love with You."" Watching this endless scene, I really wondered what was going on with James Wan, the director. Is he tired of cheap, teen horror and does he want a career as an artiste and auteur? <br/><br/>""The Conjuring 2"" is really hard to look at. The allegedly haunted Enfield council house is visually repugnant. There are threadbare, royal blue chairs on a threadbare, royal blue rug. If you have any taste at all, you know what horror I dare invoke with these words. Everything in the house is begrimed. It looks as if a toddler had been rolled in molasses and car exhaust and then set loose on every fixture. And of course the family is so poor that they can't afford a single one-hundred watt bulb. The house is kept at forty-watt level throughout the film. <br/><br/>The allegedly scary stuff: kids levitate and speak in deep voices. A scary nun appears. If you've ever gone to Catholic school you are laughing as hard as I was at this point. The nun looks so much like Marilyn Manson that I'm sure his lawyers are asking for their cut of the film's box office. <br/><br/>There are some cinematic classics in the horror genre. James Whale's Frankenstein is indelible. ""The Haunting"" from 1963 is one of the most profound and disturbing films ever made. These films are about so much more than James Wan's bag of tricks, which consists of sending an impaired person into a dark space – say, Patrick Wilson after he's been partially blinded by escaping steam from a broken radiator, having that person stumble about, holding the camera on one spot for a long time, and then having a scary nun pop suddenly into the frame. Horror classics have something truly menacing and challenging behind the costume. <br/><br/>There is something truly scary behind ""The Conjuring 2"" and behind the Amityville Horror, another Warren cause celebre. In both cases, we are talking about broken families. We are talking about kids who have troubled relationships with their parents, or absent parents. Shenanigans like the Warren's obscure the real facts that really need to be addressed. At least two of the children who grew up in the Amityville home say that they were abused by their stepfather. We were so busy looking for demons in that house we couldn't see the kids being hurt. <br/><br/>Another disturbing aspect of this film. I'm really sick of James Wan's exploitation of Catholicism, a religion he evidences zero respect for but loves to exploit in order to plump up his box office. Wan is constantly tossing crucifixes, rosaries, and clerical garb onto his piles of junk. Ed Warren, in ""Conjuring 2,"" references the Catholic Church so many times it is monotonous. Wan is from Malaysia, a Muslim majority country. He is himself Chinese. I do not see him denigrating Islam or Confucianism in his films. He wants to avoid any risk of true horror."

","THIS IS A NO SPOILER REVIEW <br/><br/>Wow. Trust me guys, this movie is extremely good. The casting is perfect. The storyline is very very good, and as a 'Horror' movie, it's very very scary. This movie has everything really. But more importantly, James Wan has proved us again that he's the best horror movie director today. The Conjuring 2 and Insidious 1 are the two scariest horror movies that actually have a great plot in both that I have ever experienced in the 21st Century. <br/><br/>I looked at every single details in this movie and it is f**king flawless. The casting of Janet (Madison Wolfe) is brilliant. This is her biggest performance ever in a movie and she is fantastic. She is a star, and throughout this movie, she really shines. The music is fantastic. It's very very old schooled. One scene involving a music will warmth your heart. It teared me up a little bit, and if you have watched it, you know which one I'm talking about. But my God, the music, the setting, and all of these little details supported how the movie feels like we're watching a 1977 movie. Most of all, James Wan directed it perfectly. <br/><br/>For once in a horror movie, it actually have stories. I mean the other horror movies are just there to grab people's money. Paranormal Activity is an example. This movie involved a family, the power of love, religion, and supporting one another until the end. This movie contained messages and there are themes. There's a difference between a 'horror' movie involving killings and deaths and blood, and a true horror film involving a story based on a true story and a very good plot and characters. <br/><br/>Finally, Patrick Wilson. I love this man. He is truly perfect for Horror movies as he has starred in Insidious and Conjuring (Both the most successful horror films directed by James Wan), and he made that character alive in this one. <br/><br/>There is one 'Con' about this one and it really doesn't affect how the viewers see it but I just need to point it out. The ending made the 'true story' into a fantasy really as it involved the power of love and a happy end. But really, the ending was good in my opinion, but it just doesn't seem real at all, but do not let this ending be an excused to not watch the movie because you will miss out. <br/><br/>If you love movies, this is a fantastic horror film. If you love horror films, this is a must watch. Overall, this movie deserves a 9.4/10. Thanks for reading the review guys, and if you like it, hit the yes button."

","I am a big fan of 'The Conjuring' and I think it's the best horror movie of this decade so far. The expectations were high for the sequel with James Wan returning, but I also knew that the track record for horror sequels in general is not very good. As a horror movie, I think 'The Conjuring 2' succeeded at being entertaining and scary. <br/><br/>The camera-work from James Wan is as good as it was in the first entry. The build up to the scary scenes is well-made and I love his establishing shots of the house. Something as banal as a chair can become scary in this movie. To me the best part of this movie was clearly James Wan's direction.<br/><br/>In fact, there's a lot of good in this movie, but I was not a fan of the script. I know it's not necessarily fair to compare it to the first one, but we didn't get the big 'Annabelle' or the basement scares that we had in the first one. I also felt like the demon was not very threatening.<br/><br/>To me the first 30-45 minutes were really scary and entertaining, at some point I was telling myself ""Well, this is almost on par with the first one', but things got a little bit out of hands in the last act. Without giving up spoilers, at some point in the film there's a new ghost entity that reveal itself. When you'll see the movie you will understand what I'm talking about. It took me a little bit out of the story, especially since they kept telling us it's based on a true story. But it was a cool ghost nevertheless.<br/><br/>All things together, there are some great performances (I liked the little girl playing Janet) and spooky filmmaking by James Wan. It's not very fair to compare this with the first Conjuring, but if we compare it with other horror movies coming out these days, ""The Conjuring 2"" prove itself to be a worthy sequel.<br/><br/>8/10"
"spicytaco12345","1","27","61","26 July 2016"," One of the biggest disappointments of the year
","OK everyone you can choose what to believe when it comes to the user reviews but my point of view this has to be on the low end of James wans' work. The movie had its moments of scary things happening but juxtaposing to all his other works this quite a let down. Majority of the ""tension"" scenes were very obvious and highly predictable e.g boy hears something scary, looks around corner to be nothing, looks away and spooky noise happens again, he's confused, slight tension then boom jump scare.<br/><br/>Comparing to the original that shy'd away from using cgi or any kind of ""showing"" of the haunting The Conjuring 2 reverted to using concerning B grade level of cgi which did not flatter anything.<br/><br/>There were plot holes, poor dialogue in some cases too many supernatural story lines going on at once that had me going ""why is this even included"" <br/><br/>The ending had me wanting to leave the cinema because it pretty much reminded me of PIMP MY RIDE. With it concluding as a demon possessing a ghost with that ghost possessing a young girl... <br/><br/>""Yo dawg we heard you like hauntings so we possessed your ghost with a demon so you can get possessed while being haunted"" *peace signs* *hip-hop music playing*<br/><br/>tldr; its a money grab movie and don't waste your time with it, see it if someone else pays for it"

","I seriously don't get the hype around The Conjuring & Insidious. They go so over the top I can't take them seriously. What ever happened to a slow burn or subtlety in horror? Don't get me wrong, I love high concept horror or a good cheese fest too. Evil Dead, Poltergeist, Hellraiser... they're not exactly documentary level BUT Conjuring sets itself up as some kind of 'realistic' horror. Constantly reminding us 'Based on a true story' well then give me a little credibility. 'The Amityville Horror' or 'The Haunted' have a foot in reality that revvs up near the end to good effect. This film lets go of reality from the beginning and personally no amount of loud jump scares can make up for a complete lack of atmosphere. <br/><br/>They even cram in things that didn't even happen in the 'real' story. A freaking ghost nun demon? Or how about a scene were a dog turns into an 8 foot tall crooked man? A scene so far out the box even a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel looks low key by comparison. <br/><br/>The actors playing the mother Peggy and the oldest daughter put on the worst 'cockney' accents I've heard since my high school presentation of Oliver Twist."
"James_De_Bello","5","11","22","26 June 2016"," 5/10
","Directed by horror veteran James Wan, ""The Conjuring 2"" picks up 6 years later of its predecessor and finds Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorrain Warren (Vera Farmiga) struggling with their marriage in the face of Lorrain being haunted by a demon whilst they accept to travel to London to help a single mother (Frances O'Connor) and her four kids whose house is being haunted by a malicious spirit trying to corrupt the younger sister (Madison Wolfe).<br/><br/>When the first ""Conjuring"" came out the out-pour of love for it left me absolutely incredulous, I will admit it had a couple of good scares and overall empathetic characters, but the handling of the true story aspect of the film was disastrous, the direction wasn't particularly inspired and it was basically not scary to me and relied too heavily on what are only jump scares that are a little less noticeable because of how James Wan masks them.<br/><br/>Still, I went into ""The Conjuring 2"" very open minded and wanting to be proved wrong, but most of all, I wanted a good horror ride filled of tension and scares. Just as with its predecessor, I find myself disagreeing with the love for this film. What I got was an overlong, bloated and occasionally offensive film. Normally if I find a movie to be offending my intelligence I go really low on it, yet ""The Conuring 2"" has enough moments to distract me from the very brief ones in which I found the filmmakers to be talking down on the audience and not treating them as equals.<br/><br/>Just as with ""The Conjuring"", the haunted characters we are presented to are well fleshed out. They aren't by any stretch of the imagination as deep as a ""Chris MacNeil"" in ""The Exorcist"", but they do have a dynamic that's interesting and you can't help but stick behind them as they battle with their struggles because of how ordinarily they are presented to you and for my money there is a pretty clear inspiration on Wan's part from a much superior recent horror film: ""The Babadook"". There are some striking similarities in how the weight of being a mother is represented to you and whilst the inspiration is a little too evident, it really does work in getting you behind a mother continuously on the verge of breaking.<br/><br/>Moreover, there is a strange bipolarism in the way this film is shot and edited. It looks like it was done by two different people. I'll talk later about the dullness of a half of the film, but there is some really inspired stuff in certain points and what makes it frustrating is that repeatedly when the film is having these great moments, it decides to cut away from them and go for some cheap horror tricks that result completely ineffective in the face of what was being built up. Indicative of this is a moment, at the start of the second act more or less, where the little boy goes down the house in the middle of the night to drink and we see him drink from the outside, on a steady shot showing just two windows in the house, it is a very simple shot, but in that moment a whole lot of possibilities open up and sprinkle amazing tension. And then what do the filmmakers decide to do? Cut to the garden outside where a swing is creaking.<br/><br/>That is the kind of stuff that happens throughout the movie that left me baffled. Not to mention, the ridiculous use of jump scares by Wan. I honestly and unfortunately don't get why he is hailed as the greats horror director of our time. Really this sh*t is supposed to be scary? My suggestion to everybody is to watch ""Rosemery's Baby"" and get a real taste of what scary is, there are one, two at best, jump scares. What Wan does here is simply make everything culminate in a jump scare of some sorts, visually, with sound or dialogue, it's always there and by the third scare in I had given up on it. He is trying to build tension in some ways which always result cheap, because they are only there to serve the final moment and not the story. At no point I felt stakes for what was happening, it was all just so predictable and uninteresting from a horror point of view, I found it to be very unsophisticated, culminating in a finale that I had very little investment on, once again it was having good moments, but they were all overcome by the dullness of their surroundings.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the next point: this script is a mess. With the exception o the above mentioned empathetic relation with the characters who are haunted, the rest of it terribly mishandled. Vera Farmiga gives a cringe worthy performance because of the ridiculous arch she is asked to handle. The mythology is all over the place, it is co chaotic and unclear it becomes offensive: there is no logic to what happens, which demon is which and why they collide together, I have literally no idea what was going on, who was haunting who, it was a disaster and just as messy was the handling of the true story element which isn't ever addressed in the film and asks the viewers for a suspension of disbelief that is just preposterous.<br/><br/>Whilst there is respect for the filmmakers in what they are trying to do and for some of their inspired ides, I am very sorry that this is the type of horror that is being hailed at the moment and wouldn't recommend this ride to people."

"lunesca-303-939813","4","5","8","27 October 2016"," I just don't get it
","How this title currently has a rating of 7.5/10 I will never know. The horror genre has been suffering for some time under the weight of bad acting, over played jump-scares and little to no substance and this is just another addition to the long list of horror titles treading that path.<br/><br/>The problem? Honestly, it takes more to scare me than a loud bang among the silence or the sudden appearance of a distorted face in the darkness. I didn't feel invested in a single character, nor was there a tense build up of fear and trepidation when introducing the darker forces at play. Instead we are treated to having spirit after spirit shoved in our faces for the sake of a cheap trick, all whom seem to be little to no more harm than a somewhat aggravated cat. No one really seems scared by what is happening, in fact pretty much the entire cast seems to have approached their role having been told to ham up their accents but tone down any actual commitment to emotion in case the weaker members of the cast REALLY stand out. <br/><br/>Perhaps you will enjoy it. Truth is, if you liked the first one you probably will. But if you are like me and want to sit down with something that is truly going to test your nerves, you probably want to return to the Tartan film collection and find something you're yet to try."

It failed at creating any real feelings of suspense. I wasn't scared or even interested in the plot because every single time something ""scary"" happened, it stopped before anything ACTUALLY happened and cut to the next scene.

Vera Farmiga, Frances O'Connor, and the child actor Madison Wolfe are the only saving grace. I still don't understand what Franka Potente was doing in this film. I could find only one scare moment in the film➖when the demon makes a sudden appearance before Vera Farmiga's character towards the end of the film. And this wasn't exactly a scare-scare moment, it was a shock-scare moment. In fact, the only exciting part during this film was when in the basement scene with Patrick Wilson and Frances O'Connor, someone in the audience made a scary noise.

Over time the scares began to become less frequent which made the movie very tiresome near the end. I was really trying my hardest to stay awake near the end of the movie because it got really slow and boring.

"robdeceased","6","4","6","26 November 2016"," Some OK parts but gets away from itself with terrible ideas for scares.
","The Conjuring was a pretty dark and serious affair which always stayed pretty grounded in it's attempts to create a spooky atmosphere and keep the scares natural rather than obnoxious. The Conjuring 2 is pretty much the opposite of that during the second act.<br/><br/>Based on a 'true' event widely known as one of the most legitimate paranormal occurrences, C2 is set around the strange happenings to a fatherless family living in a quaint house in England. This set up is interesting at first as it starts off with poltergeist activity before graduating to full blown possession of a young girl. Before long the family enlists the help of the ghost hunter psychic lady from the first movie and her husband who, is being haunted himself by the ghost/demon taking the form of a nun with bad makeup.<br/><br/>Where this movie starts losing ground is around the second act, where the bigger scares are supposed to come they start to rely too much on almost cartoonish visuals instead of natural scares and 'realistic' poltergeist activity, which leaves the movie looking extremely silly in my opinion. When a movie goes from a TV switching channels on it's own to a giant spindly man straight out of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' it kinda loses it's appeal to me.<br/><br/>The movie is watchable, but I wouldn't watch it again willingly as I feel there's nothing to gain from a second viewing."

That would have probably killed what little suspense there was though.<br/><br/>Now I did enjoy the first one and I don't blame the producers of these films for employing some 'artistic licence' as the stories in themselves aren't particularly exciting as they are fascinating. In fact the original stories are far more engrossing than these films. <br/><br/>Sadly with this film they've decided to continue with the non scary looking ghost routine and somewhat OTT with the effects when playing on peoples senses is far more effective a medium to scare people without the need for pointless special effects and overplaying on 'action' scenes that bear no familiarity to the actual story, adds nothing to the film and makes the finished output look a bit silly"

If this film was self-aware it would be as good as Black Dynamite but, it unironically follows every beat the typical horror film these days follow (starting with the phrase 'based on real events' like that makes a film scary). The cinematography is uninspired. The soundtrack is average at best. The special effects are pretty bad. The acting ranges from standard to terrible. Overall this film is great for a good laugh but, anything else will result in a terrible experience.1/10 I would not recommend this film for anyone (except for laughs)"
"ljmg-89922","9","5","9","5 August 2017"," A great horror flick to watch on a Friday night
","The Conjuring 2 shows us the case of a family who is being haunted by the spirit of a man who used to live in their house when he was alive. He speaks and acts through Janet, one of the kids that live in the house and everything starts to go down for the family.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie isn't related to the first one so you can watch it even when you haven't seen the first Conjuring movie.<br/><br/>This is one of those stories we've heard and seen a million times before but the director James Wan presents it in such a fresh way that doesn't look full of clichés even when it has a few, like every other horror movie out there. The acting by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga is great as it is expected, but the performance that really stands out, at least in my opinion, is the one from Madison Wolfe, who plays Janet, the 11 years old girl. She gives such a believable performance that I think is great and I would like to see what she does in the future.<br/><br/>As the story goes on, the movie becomes even creepier with every scene. There aren't as many jump-scares as you would expect from an ordinary horror movie and the ones that are there are completely justified and they have a reason to be there, and this is something that James Wan always makes a good job like in his other movies like The Conjuring and the first two Insidious movies. I think the cinematography is great, I like the atmosphere they created inside the house even when it's daytime.<br/><br/>So, should you watch it? Of course! It is one of the best horror movies of the last decade. It has great acting, a great atmosphere and you will definitely have a good time, especially if you watch it with your friends or your partner."

The ghost (or whatever it is) is not really frightening and just spelling out his name makes him go away. Such a mighty ghost and just bothering a handful of people, uh...<br/><br/>Not a big fan of horror, but like good ones, this one is not.

","Wow, this was the worst movie that James Wan has ever made. Talk about long, boring, boring, boring, and no horror shocks or scares at all. This was so bad that in the first place, the Warrens NEVER even were called to investigate this supposedly true haunting in Enfield England in the early 70's. Don't waste the 2 hours and 18 mins. watching this stinker.......come on James, go back to making really scary movies like the first one, or Dead Silence. This was just awful. Went with others who were ready to walk out.<br/><br/>If you want the scary version watch the 6 hour docu-series that was just on BBC America last month or so, that was so so so so boring, but at least it was more interesting than this was.

"utslitt","6","4","7","5 July 2019"," Left a lot to be desired...
","After immediately watching this after the first Conjuring film, I found myself ridiculously let down. It pales in comparison and even stand alone it's quite unbearably boring for the first half of the movie. It's a shame this wasn't handled with more care as the storyline itself showed major potential.<br/><br/>Once we reached the second half of the film where the possession has reached its climax and things are truly discovered to be how they are, the film finally begins to glisten in all its glory. It was truly a shame the encounters before this point weren't handled as well as they were in this moment."
"eoghanmccarthy-2","3","4","7","9 October 2016"," Ridiculous, and terrible.
","This movie is ridiculous, and terrible and that's besides the unbearable accents.<br/><br/>It's a ""based on true events"" movie, and the ""true events"" are the most ridiculous claims of paranormal behavior ever... OK, maybe not ""ever""... but close. The photos of levitation are clearly a child jumping on her bed, and the ""male voice""... well you gotta look at the difference between this movie, and the original documentary / interview recording on YouTube.<br/><br/>Anyway, the ""event"" aside... this HAS got some (very few) really good scary events of it's own, well done, but it's just a terribly cheesy, poorly acted, ridiculously exaggerated movie. I don't know why Farmiga accepted the role, Dempsey is perfect for it, because he's a B- lister, and pretty good at being a terrible actor... kind of like Wahlberg.<br/><br/>I didn't like the first, or the second, but I'd watch a third out of interest."
"deloudelouvain","8","7","15","15 June 2016"," Even better then the first one
","Normally I am always a bit doubtful when it concerns sequels because most of the time they are no match to the first one. But in this case the sequel is even better then the first one. And I did like the first one as well. With The Conjuring part 2 they bring us horror at it's best. I thought there were more then enough scary moment in this movie. The entire movie feels like evil. You expect at any moment to jump out of your seat (what my wife did a couple of times eventually). It's a really dark and well made movie for this genre. The cast is perfectly chosen. I can't really fail anyone. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are perfect in their roles. The whole family Hogson did a brilliant job playing the attacked family. Bonnie Aarons as the demon nun is really scary, as well as the old guy and the crooked man. A must see if you are into possession horror movies."
"kaushalmodi1985","9","7","15","14 June 2016"," The Conjuring 2 is one of the best horror film and its doing justice to its first part.
","In Year 2013, The Conjuring was released and Its just the beginning of these Series. Its took 3 Years for its Sequel The Conjuring 2 released these Friday, which comes to definitely gives you nightmares. Question is Will Its live up to expectations and hype or will it fails. Let's analyze.<br/><br/>Movie Starts with an Story of The Amityville Horror. Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) & Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) arrives to Amityville for investigation of what happens to Lutz family and for what reasons they have to run from Amityville at midnight. for sometimes we may get confused whether its sequel to The Conjuring or Its Sequel to The Amityville Horror. The Conjuring 2 is little bit connected to The Amityville Horror. While investigating Lorraine experience the strong spirit, for what they have to left the Amityville. Then suddenly movie moves to North London, Enfield where a single mother raising her four children alone in a house. Suddenly they came to know they are plagued by malicious spirits. Lorraine and Ed Warren travels to enfiled, north London to help her. Whether they success to help her out? for that you have to be witness of these Spine Chilling Horror.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 takes viewers to thrilling ride that keeps you on the edge. Its is too scary and Spooky in some parts and giving you goosebumps at several intervals. First Half is too much interesting, while Second half is little bit talkative but its due to demand of script. but the movie change the real gears before Climax. The last 20 minutes are just awesome.<br/><br/>Director James Wan was know for his Horror Movies like Insidious 1 & 2, The Conjuring, Dead Silence and Saw 1. These time too He has done an Excellent job. He achieves his motive of shocking to viewers almost in every scene. In a Horror Movie, It's always the background score that either make or break the movie. In The Conjuring 2 background score definitely comes across as driving factors of the Movie. Its superb.<br/><br/>Overall, The Conjuring 2 is one of the best horror film and its doing justice to its first part. The film with its thrilling and chilling experience makes its a worth watching. Must experience these horror on big Screen."
"shylohsredshadow","2","8","18","28 June 2016"," Didn't live up to it's expectations for me.
","I honestly preferred the first Conjuring. The sequel didn't live up to my expectations. Having researched the real recordings and such this should have never been made into a film. I really wish they would have chosen a more ""Involved"" case file that the Warrens had actually had a huge part in. I feel like ""The Conjuring 2"" could have been so much better if there were a different case they were focusing on. This movie could have exceeded it's potential, but for me at least it just wasn't the right focus for a sequel. I do have high hopes for a ""Conjuring 3"" in the attempt to make up for ""The Conjuring 2"". In my book this just didn't scare me at all as a horror fanatic and I'm a very disappointed fan. I really had high hopes for this sequel and it let me down dramatically."
"wizard_whitebeard","2","10","24","14 June 2016"," Really disappointed in you IMDb!
","After seeing this movie today and reading the ""stellar"" reviews here on IMDb I can only come to the conclusion that these studios are paying people to write positive reviews.<br/><br/>There was even moments that the audience laughed, which is something that should never happen in a horror movie, couple this with fill in scenes that added nothing at all to the story line and cringe worthy lines...<br/><br/>I won't go into any detail as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone but I honestly cannot recommend it and the quality is no where near the original."
"tomholland2016","8","5","10","10 June 2016"," Best horror sequel ever made!
","'Knock Knock' 'Well, hmmm, who's there???' 'Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, (giggles)'<br/><br/>The audio tape suddenly played on the recording, well ACTUAL RECORDING when the movie closed the curtains. Hearing the voice made me thought, 'So everything that I went through for 134 minutes a while ago was based on a true story???' (It is told after the Amityville Horror)<br/><br/>James Wan did it again, except that this time is even much much better. I was surprised by the sequel as usually the latter being the let-down, as people claimed it to profuse more money for a producer.<br/><br/>He commences the movie with Amityville Horror which is very tricky to bring the difference as a lot of horror movies has brought that up as the theme to their stories, and Wan potentially lets the audience gets inside Lorraine's world to find the horrendous truth behind the father's cruelty.<br/><br/>But there is a file from the Warrens that shocked the world and it became one of the unprecedented cases in history, and this file is specifically called the Enfield Poltergeist.<br/><br/>I don't want to break the eggs for you so in subtlety, the story line is excellent, most of the audience will be left haunting for more at the end. Maybe the structure got stuck with the first Conjuring, but this one tells a more complex plot as Ed and Lorraine struggle with the new era. The twists make the audience gasps for air, why??? Wait until you watch the movie. <br/><br/>The pacing is impeccable for a horror movie especially the part when Ed has a pair of burning eyes caused by the pipeline gas. We can see the camera is viewing from Ed's ambiguous eyes like a first-person shooter except that this is not a war movie. Every second the cameras pans to vast angles, the more we induce ourselves to look at the periphery visions despite the scares that are about to reveal.<br/><br/>It is unexpected when the shouting and screaming this time isn't annoying. The voices bring beautiful melodies. I know it's bizarre to say this but sometimes the truth is the truth.<br/><br/>The horror is a full-time menacing. Even when the Sun filtrates the window, the demons tend to harass the humans. The creepiness is there, it crawls through every corner of your body and makes you shudder.<br/><br/>If I was to describe this in one word, it'd be: MASTERPIECE<br/><br/>Rate: 84/100"

","Overall setting of the movie was not bad. I would say this well constructed. However, the foundation of the fear the demon and the source of those things was too weak as per my perception. So when it was really getting better I only felt silly. I simply find no ground to find it scary or horror movie. When the movie was getting better they just killed it. So I did not enjoy it as a horror movie.<br/><br/>Just some scenes, the girl is being possessed by the demon inside the house. The guys cannot get inside. Someone brings an axe and cannot penetrate the wooden door. It took him long long time to finally break that door. A guy goes inside and Then, he is acting all delirious, weak and so on...

"rogerwelin","1","6","13","30 August 2016"," One of the worst movies of all times
","This is definitely one of the worst movies made, it's 2h 14min of my life I will never get back. I bet that 50% of the movies budget has gone to paying off reviewers here.<br/><br/>It's supposed to be a horror movie but it's not scary at all. The movie relies on cheap jump scares accompanied with music to accelerate the effect, it has no eerie atmosphere, no kind of mystery and no creepiness going on at all. The ghosts/demons are rendered with terrible CGI effects, making it laughable instead of scary.<br/><br/>Lets talk about the obvious and stupid plot holes: * The amityville scene has no right being there, it has no logical place in the movie at all. Probably the director just wants to set up an opportunity to milk the franchise more. * We learn that the Marilyn Manson look-alike nun demon behind the massacre at amityville has flown to England to scare some girls there using a dead resident there named Bill because reasons. * The umbrella demon with terrible CGI shows up two times and then vanish because reasons (with no other explanations) * Nun demon, valak, can be banished by saying it's name which it told Lorraine.... WTF? This is beyond stupid! It told it's name even though this is the way to banish it? So incredibly stupid.. If I was Lucifer, Valak would have to clean out his desk because his/it's stupidity is beyond reasons * Ed's crucifix affects the ghost but not the trizillion crucifix in the bedroom * The demons masterplan to kill Ed is to impale him on a a tree... Come on! * The demon wants to possess the annoying girl in the family but in the end scene tries to impale her too because reasons<br/><br/>The only real horrifying thing in this movie is that the movie tries to shove it down our throats that this is a true story and the Warrens are heroes using the power of god. It's a known fact that the Warrens are hoaxers, manipulating broken families with mental illnesses to convince them they are haunted. It's both revolting and disgusting"
"irotinmyskin-1","2","6","13","17 June 2016"," There is nothing even resembling a horror movie here.
","First of all let me start with this simple premise: Nothing ever written or said by the Warren is true. They are one of the most famous scam artists in the whole paranormal investigating field. It is been widely known that their involvement in the Amytiville case was prefabricated with the help of the Lutz family in order to cash in from the original DeFeo murders. Once you take that out of the equation the claims of this movie being ""a true story"" leaves us with a regular movie without anything special<br/><br/>One good thing i can say is that it is beautifully done, the photography is great, the color palette, camera movements, editing, it is pretty well made. So the fault is not one of technical aspects but more of a lack of substance and extremely painful cheesy moments. Acting is regular, they do their best but no one stands out, Vera Farmiga is good but her character has nothing special nor it conveys anything that draws you in. The little girl does her best but you can tell at any moment she's acting and it doesn't convince you in any way. Finally beware of the Elvis Presley scene, it will make you cringe in horror of the awfulness of that part, it is like you're watching a Steven Spielberg kid horror movie. <br/><br/>Stay away from this children ""horror"" movie."

"colephelps-84155","10","7","17","15 June 2016"," Fantastic Sequel
","The Conjuring 2 exceeded my expectations. After a lot of horror movies going downhill and failing ridiculously, James Wan comes back for his 'Conjuring' franchise and rips it. Most of horror sequel don't live up to the expectations of it's predecessor but The Conjuring 2 was, IMO, better than the first one. James Wan has done a magnificent job here. <br/><br/>You know a horror movie is scary when the title comes on and it scares the hell out of you. The cinematography, the tension the movie builds is on point. Even paintings and pictures scare the **** out of you. The movie includes no blood or gore (except the first scene) and still manages to scare the life out of you. James Wan doesn't follow the horror movie blueprint. In a regular horror movie, traditionally, when you're trying to prove a ghostly creature in your house to someone but the unusual doesn't show up until the people are gone. James Wan isn't following the tradition, instead the unusual happenings happen in front of anybody, there's no hiding. You see a lot of movies where actors are trying to investigate and all those stupid thing that you'd never do in real life, The Conjuring 2 is as same as what we'd do if we were in those situation. First time ever i've seen smart people inside a horror movie who do the sensible thing to get out of the house. <br/><br/>There are lot of things James Wan has done by not following the horror movie blueprint and it has absolutely paid off. The movie is 10/10 scary. Actors are smart and acting is very good. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are back again as the paranormal investigator and demonologist. Acting is top notch. Even those 5 British kids and Frances O'Connor playing British mom was outstanding. A huge performance mainly by Madison Wolfe A.K.A Janet and her acting was marvellous. <br/><br/>For those who liked The Conjuring would really love The Conjuring 2. It's 10/10 scary, 10/10 acting, 10/10 creepy soundtrack. 10/10 jump scares, 10/10 scary creatures and 10/10 movie. Well done to James Wan for single handedly carrying horror franchise. Would go first day for The Conjuring 3 if it is to ever happen."

"sukanya-samy","8","1","1","28 October 2016"," James Wan knows his craft
","Watching a horror movie alone in a theater.<br/><br/>Check.<br/><br/>Watching a horror movie alone in a theater, with nobody else there.<br/><br/>Well, almost check.<br/><br/>I had about 5 more people sitting at the back. So it still felt like I was the only one in that big room watching on the big screen.<br/><br/>Conjuring 2, as most people would know by now follows Ed and Lorraine Warren to the famous or rather infamous Enfield case in London. The Enfield case itself was quite widely covered by tabloids and some daily's but is also considered mostly a hoax. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that it was not real. This site â€“ History Vs. Hollywood covers it quite well.<br/><br/>James Wan has taken quite a few creative liberties with this case as the Warrens were just two of the many paranormal investigators who visited the Hodgsons and they were there only for a day to investigate. But having said that, I really liked the movie. James Wan has the craft to show the audience a horror without it being a slug or gore or bad makeup fest â€“ he has the ability to build on the characters so well that you actually care for them. That is a hard thing to do in films. If you do not care for the main characters, then the film is almost as good as dead.<br/><br/>The story itself might be called clichÃ©d by many, but I think its the emotions like fear, sadness, grief and depression that actually make every clichÃ©d horror story different. The Hodgsons were poor, they hardly had enough money to buy even biscuits and Peggy Hodgson, the matriarch, was barely meeting ends for her 4 children. So you immediately feel for the characters and as they say, when you are down is when you get kicked in the guts. The main character â€“ Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, the one who is possessed from time to time, does a brilliant job. Her fear, agony and sadness is palpable. The others in the family too were quite good as supporting characters.<br/><br/>I have to dedicate a paragraph for Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. I have seen their movies as separate lead actors but their chemistry as a couple is really powerful. You actually see the love, affection, blind trust and deep bonds that even the real life Warrens might not have had. They did a stellar job in this part of Conjuring as the first one and the movie was as much about their love than it was about the poltergeist.<br/><br/>Coming to the actual horror in the movie, the poltergeist Valak is an actual documented demon. But its not Marilyn Manson dressed as a nun or even Sharon Needles. See the resemblance?<br/><br/>Valak is actually depicted as taking the form of a disfigured child with wings which might have been scarier I think.<br/><br/>That was one miss from James Wan. He does admit that the design of the main demon was actually done at the 11th hour. But there are a couple of sequences involving the Valak that are done quite well and a large part of the credit goes to Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>The other small part I didn't like was the screen time of 2 hours 14 minutes â€“ I think the movie could have been edited down to lesser. It felt a little long and sluggish at times.<br/><br/>But other than that, the movie was great. It was crafted well, jump scares were actual jump scares rather than just loud noises and the story was really well knit together. I would continue to pay money to watch good horror movies on a big screen â€“ its where it looks and sounds the best. First reviewed on broth of blogs"
"Bowie_Knife90","10","6","15","12 June 2016"," Holy Hell
","I've been on this site for years and have never reviewed a title. Even the ones I really loved and have felt the urge to - I just never did. Something about The Conjuring 2 is changing that for me. I went to see this just yesterday after weeks of anticipation. I was a fan of the first and honestly didn't expect this one to be any better from the preview(s), even with all the hype and the praise.<br/><br/>But I was wrong.<br/><br/>This did not feel like a sequel to me at all. I started to forget that it was during parts of the film. It definitely had the first films feel and vibe but also mixed in with some ""Insidious"" and a dash of ""The Babadook"". If you're a fan of either of those films I'm sure you'd be into this. <br/><br/>My friends and I decided we'd go to the city to see this. When we got there it was packed with people as expected and we had no choice but to sit in the very front row, same thing was actually happening to my sister who went to the same city at the same time but to a different theater. Anyway, as soon as the opening credits started rolling up I got chills and everyone went silent, my friends and I completely forgot all about our uncomfortable seating situation and it was as if the audience became one. <br/><br/>Fortunately our audience was great, there were no cell phones going off and no one was being louder than they should. Everyone payed full attention to the film, clapping and cheering as well as screaming and laughing in unison throughout it. Some even stayed sitting in their seats after all the end credits were over and the lights had came back on to let it sink in. My friends and I felt emotionally drained (in a good way) after exiting the theater. The thing about this film is that it makes you feel a range of emotions you didn't know a horror film could do. There was fear, happiness, sadness, and just pure anxiety and unease. You definitely felt awake and at the edge of your seat at all times. At first seeing how long this film was going to be I was scared that it might drag on or get boring at some point but this never bored me and there were no parts that I feel I could say weren't needed for the story. The 2 hours went by so fast in my opinion, making it feel like it was shorter than it actually was, that's how good it was and how much fun it was to watch. I don't scare easily as I've seen it all so this didn't exactly make me cover my eyes at any points or make me feel scared once I turned the lights out and went to bed but, gosh this film was so good. Everything about it was good and might be my absolute favorite of the year. The actors were great, the writing was great, cinematography, atmosphere, etc etc etc... I feel like I can't praise this film enough! <br/><br/>My friends and I all give this one, without a doubt, a 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>(Also the people saying that this was a snooze fest are the same people who thought the poltergeist remake was a 10/10 horror film)."

","In 1977, in London, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) has financial difficulties to raise her children Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Janet (Madison Wolfe), Johnny (Patrick McAuley) and Billy (Benjamin Haigh) since her husband has left her to live with a neighbor. When her daughter Janet sleepwalks and claims to talk to the spirit of an old man, Peggy does not believe in the beginning. But soon she witnesses supernatural phenomena in the house and concludes that Janet is possessed by a demon. Her neighbor and friends call the police and the officers also see the mysterious event. One of them tells the local priest and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are invited to travel to London by the church to team up with the paranormal investigators Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney) and the skeptical Anita Gregory (Franka Potente) to see whether it would be a hoax. They witness weird events but they do not conclude it is true. What is happening in the Hodgson house?<br/><br/>""The Conjuring 2"" is another great supernatural film directed by James Wan. The film keeps the creepy atmosphere with great performances, highlighting the girl Madison Wolfe.

","'The Conjuring 2' is a perfect example of what more sequels should be. It is a perfectly executed horror sequel and Director James Wan effectively explores themes of vision,belief and faith. The family drama is very effective and Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are efficient in their roles. The film doesn't provide anything new in horror genre, but its set pieces are often impressive even though it rely on jump scares. 'The Conjuring 2' has good story & suspense to have appeal on all kinds of horror fans. Unlike Sinister 2, it sticks to the basics and efficiently delivers a solid horror film. I give 4/5 for this efficiently made horror sequel by James Wan."

The Conjuring 2 enters to that 0,1% when sequel is as good as original or even better!<br/><br/>I don't want to talk a lot about it's content, because nobody likes spoilers, but the story is kinda repetitive. Big family, big old house, Warrens come, fall in love with the family and wishes to help them... Yes, just like the first movie. But director surprised Me second time that day. He added things that is exact opposite for all horror movies. Ghost talks with journalist in front of cameras? It was something new for Me.<br/><br/>Talking about horror genre, everyone wants to know: ""was it scary?"" Was it? Yes, indeed. Well, it had jump-scares, if your curious about that. But it was scary in a different way. Some scenes gave Me creeps, I don't know how to call it, maybe it's pure horror? Fear? But there isn't many movies which can do this. But if it, however manage to do this, I call it - successful.<br/><br/>So all in all, for Me, amateur, who loves horror movies, Conjuring 2 was almost excellent movie."

","This is my review of The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case (spoiler free)<br/><br/>***** (5/5)<br/><br/>Cast: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor.<br/><br/>Plot: Lorraine (Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Wilson) travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits. <br/><br/>I just want to start by saying this the best sequel to a horror that I have ever seen, the first Conjuring (2013) was the only horror to scare me and this, this is exactly the same. Director James Wan is known in most parts as the master of horror I think he is living up to that name. After the previous movie he directed Fast & Furious 7 (2015) which made a billion dollars worldwide, he said however before making that he was never going to make anymore horrors which is fine because loads of directors change their genre. Just like the original this has a very good plot which is known all around the UK as fake it was made up, because a poltergeist is a spirit that is made normally by teenagers, this is basically the story of how real those were. The original one the reason why I like these films so much is because they have a dark atmosphere, a good plot, good acting and basically just feels real like you're really there it's terrifying. Also I like to add that in the first each time before the scare there was suspense and the suspense is exactly the same in this one if not better. In my opinion a horror is supposed to scary and this just like the original are way better than the PG-13 jump scares, like the Paranormal Activity series.<br/><br/>In the first one we saw that the spirit was haunting a child and this is the same except somewhat different, the spirit is haunting 11 year old Janet Hodgson (Wolfe) but not just her it seems the spirit wants the whole family out. They seek the help of spirit hunters Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren to see if they can help their haunting problem it's basically the same as the first but who said you can't follow originality. It feels real as you're watching it, it genuinely feels like there is something behind you. The first Conjuring as I previously was the first actual to scare the living daylights out of me, and this as I said before is the same.<br/><br/>Here are some reasons as to why I think this is a horror not to be missed:<br/><br/>Story: Like the first one this has a terrific story which is conveniently based on a true story which everybody around the UK knows it was made up. This time it is set 6 years after the events of the first one. There is the connection in this story however it doesn't even show you a glimpse of what happened last time but this is still the sequel. It's basically the same story as first except no creepy doll this time and that is when you should keep the originality. The story is truly scary and will probably scare you too.<br/><br/>Connection between movies: There isn't really a connection it just continues of sorts but it is the sequel because as it says on the poster The Conjuring 2. There is little connection however not shown anywhere in the film. I am just glad there is a sequel.<br/><br/>The real moral of this story is that it's not about ghosts or ghouls, or anything creepy, it just shows you how bad the weather is in England. The real reason I gave it 10/10 is because it is the perfect sequel to a perfect horror that is of course an opinion. At this point I would be stating the faults of this movie but there really isn't any. The special effects are amazing and it is truly a terrifying spectacle that is just as good or better than the first. Just a true delight.<br/><br/>Verdict: Terrifying, and will hopefully scare the living daylights out of you. A worthy sequel James Wan you are the king. <br/><br/>10/10 worth every single penny."

","The Conjuring 2 is a sequel to the acclaimed original, which is once again directed by James Wan. The basic premise of another haunting in a single mother's household in England sounds interesting at first sight, yet slows down over time. The 2 hr 14 min runtime makes the pacing feel slow and the simple plot dragged to the point of boredom. There's a few decent scares that almost capture the terror of the original, but it mostly comes down to cheap jumpscares and ""spooky "" images. Overall, this sequel left me extremely disappointed and worried for the future of the franchise if even a main entry can't deliver."
"baileycrawly","9","0","0","27 June 2020"," Better Than the Original
","This film really works hard to not be a carbon copy of the original film, and it pulls it off well. It does a fantastic job at balancing characters and character development alongside the scares and isn't afraid to take a moment or two to show us some true humanity in between bone-chilling scenes.
Perhaps it was after Annabelle came out that Warner Bros. decided to expand the concept into an entire ""universe,"" because this film, while being a film that can be enjoyed on its own, does a fantastic job of setting the stage for some of the films that would come in the future.
Watching the films in chronological order, this one definitely feels like it's setting up the future instalments more than any of the others. The stakes are higher, the suspense is stronger and the Warrens are ready to rise to the challenge.
Really the only downfall of this film is its hideous use of effects at certain times. Some of these scenes look like they were shot right at the end when the budget was really starting to dry up and the producers needed to go as cheap as possible. They were distracting and took me out of the film but, in general, I think they handled the material pretty well.<br/><br/>Of course, there's undoubtedly a lot of changes from the actual events as they occurred, either for scares or drama (as there undoubtedly were multiple changes made in the translation from reality to the story the Warrens would tell everybody about what happened... if, in fact, anything actually happened), but the way the story was told and the details didn't take away from the film in general.<br/><br/>James Wan knows what he's doing and I hope to see him working on more films in this universe in the future."

","The Conjuring 2 doesn't waste time in bringing the scares in. By that, I mean you're pretty much in the thick of it from the get-go, being given some background (via another very notorious haunting incident) for what is to follow.<br/><br/>The Warrens are sent on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which is whipping up a media storm in Enfield, England and, as per the first movie, they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation. Once again, a family is being haunted and they fear for their sanity and lives. There are a few new twists this time round, so all does not play out as before - but it's not a complete departure from the format, which might have made it a bit more gripping in places.<br/><br/>James Wan's trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that.<br/><br/>What's really enjoyable about this movie, is its nostalgic recreation of 70s England. Wan has really done a great job of this, which is surprising given that he's not from there. Also, the central support role of Janet Hodgson is pretty crucial to empathising with the Enfield family and Madison Wolfe gives a solid performance.<br/><br/>It's arguable this one is as strong as the first. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed part one, or indeed likes movies of a haunting or possession theme.<br/><br/>Some awesome, unsettling and creepy music in places too."

","In THE CONJURING 2, we get caught up w/ Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who have been busy working on another case. Hint: Some terrible events have taken place in a very familiar house. Director James Wan pays homage once again to horror films of yore. Soon, the Warrens find themselves in Enfield, England, where a single mum (Frances O'Connor) and her four children are apparently under attack by something beyond human. This time, it's either a hoax, or the most bizarre and dangerous manifestation the Warrens have ever faced. Wilson and Farmiga play their roles w/ such ease, it's absolutely believable that they're a long-married couple. The British location works well, and placing it in 1977 gives it a nostalgic feel, like in the first film. In this movie, we get not only possession, but actual entities for the Warrens to deal with. The fantastic Bonnie Aarons is on hand to play a demonic creature w/ a very bad ""habit"", and Javier Botet embodies a gangly monstrosity that seems as though it could only be 100% CGI! Wan turns a smallish apartment into a house of horrors, and reminds us how a good sequel is made..."

","Yeah, skipping Annabelle for now since, at least on my account, it isn't out on Netflix yet at the time I'm writing this. Off to the review: The Conjuring 2 improves on its predecessor with a more gripping story, ratcheting up the tension and scares, better performances, improved blend of scary moments and quiet moments and a genuinely menacing villain. To cut a long story short, this third entry in the franchise avoids reiterating the same information as its direct predecessor and creates an atmospheric, exhilarating horror-thriller that enhances its direct predecessor's merits just the way a sequel should."

","The second cinematic film in the Warren cinematic universe, this movie starts where other movies like The Amityville Horror take hours to show. Yes, the Warrens really did go to 112 Ocean Avenue. The jury is, however, out as to whether Lorraine had a vision of the murders, followed the ghost of one of the Lutz children into the basement and then met Valak the Nun, who would go on to be in her own series of movies.<br/><br/>The ghost boy is based on the infamous Amityville photo - you know the one, it wasn't shown until years later when the first movie was on its PR tour.<br/><br/>The movie then moves on to another paranormal case, the Enfield haunting of 1977. Janet Hodgson - while sleepwalking - would speak in the voice of an angry elderly man. The Warrens are determined to save her and her family, while Lorraine is concerned that Ed will be killed.<br/><br/>In addition to introducing the Nun character, this movie also has an appearance by the Crooked Man, who will obviously soon get his own Conjuring universe movie, alongside Annabelle (Annabelle, Annabelle: Creation, Annabelle Comes Home) and La Llorona (The Curse of La Llorona).<br/><br/>I was happy to see Franka Potente in a movie. She was such a force in Run Lola Run and its a shame she isn't in more movies. Here, she plays Anita Gregory, a real-life scientist who was a member of the Society for Psychical Research that investigated the Enfield Haunting.<br/><br/>This was directed by James Wan, who always adds a layer of sheen and class to his horror proceedings. He's learned a ton since the Saw films and hey - I even like his silly slasher film, Dead Silence. It was written by the team of Wan, David Leslie Johnson (Aquaman, Orphan) and the twin writing team of Chad and Carey Hayes. Interestingly enough, Chad was in Death Spa in his younger days.<br/><br/>I also love the art direction in the Conjuring films. The Warren's study is filled with mystical artifacts from their many adventures, like the golden upside-down skull from Vice Versa that caused Judge Reinhold and Fred Savage to switch bodies. There's also a great poster of a young Joanna Lumley from Absolutely Fabulous in the girls' room. You can also spot a poster for Exorcist II: The Heretic in the montage of England set to The Clash's ""London Calling.""<br/><br/>Also, just so there's no debate, beyond being a possession movie, an Amityville movie and a movie about situations based on real-life events, this is also a Christmas movie!"

The acting is excellent: Vera Farmiga is exemplary in both movies, and the rest of the cast perform very well, especially in The Conjuring 2.

","The Conjuring 2: A Horror Movie Review 
The Conjuring 2: Between the directing of James Wan and the acting of Madison Wolfe, Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson this movie is absolutely astounding. The special effects and the music with the Foley add to the movie and the movie deserves all the credit it gets. This movie is arguably one of the best in the Conjuring franchise with a fabulous plot and incredible acting and it was a box office bonanza. 
Director James Wan and writers Chad Hayes, Carey W. Hayes and David Leslie Johnson craft this movie to not just rely on jump scares and special effects but to rely on the story line and the set and the acting. The story has jump scares and scary special effects, but it is not only that. As far as the cinematography goes, Don Burgess made the scenes detailed but still easy to comprehend. He deserves the credit he gets. 
 Another thing that this movie has going for it is the incredible Madison Wolfe who in this movie was such an incredible little actress for being so young at the time. She plays the lead role Janet Hodgson who is forced into servile work by Valak the demon nun as she is taken over. No one outside her mom (France O' Connor) believes her especially when she fakes an event but it is only to protect her family. Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lorraine Warren (Vera Farminga) are the only people willing to help them when Valak is at its worst as everyone else was churlish toward them. 
The set fits the movie because the house is dingy and dirty. It makes it creepy and more horrifying, and when you hear the creaking of the stairs at night. Or the floor breaking in the laundry room, or the flooding where something could be lurking in the dark water. The filmmakers understand that they cannot beat around the bush with what is happening in this movie, it is intense and powerful as fear is always hovering over you and as you are watching keep you on the edge of you seat. 
The director lets the story grow before solving the problem, the audience see's the film through an outside perspective. The Conjuring 2 send the protagonist Janet and her mother down a hole of demons and dark issues including an almost death situation. The movie's overall message leaves you with a feeling of fear that sometimes things are not always what they seem."

","Despite the occasional tonal relapse and iffy moment of forced comedic levity, 'The Conjuring 2 (2016)' manages to maintain a consistent level of quality by providing the tension and suspense we've come to expect from this series in spades. It is actually probably scarier than the first thanks mainly to the fact that the threat feels palpably deadly almost right from the start of the stellar set-up. This instalment also manages to create a couple of memorably creepy supernatural creatures that frighten with their superb and unique design alone, yet are still treated with the respect that Wan clearly has for the genre and the general craft - which here he seems to have mastered, able to play the audience like a finely-tuned piano. Character maintains a prevalent factor throughout, though, meaning that we truly care for the people at the heart of these dangerous situations.

","We continue on with the paranormal adventures of Ed (Patrick Wilson ) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren of Amityville fame. They are asked to go to Enfield and investigate a haunting or poltergeist case centering around Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) and the spirit of Bill.<br/><br/>The film is filled with jump scares, whispers, screams, etc. enough to make it enjoyable.<br/><br/>Much of the film follows reported incidents (a bit exaggerated) and the criticism and skepticism of the time (and today). Claims that Janet did the pranks and practiced ventriloquism as well as being caught red handed faking incidents are included in the feature.The film makers took liberties with reports such as the police report that a chair wobbled from side to side, became a chair moving across the room. The role of Ed and Lorraine was minor and I would suggest the reason why they never wrote about it was that until the last half hour of the film, they deemed it a hoax and that last part was Hollywood writers earning their dime. As an entertaining Poltergeist film, it is all that. As to being factual, there have been other films and features on Enfield that are far less horrific and supernatural.<br/><br/>Go watch the film for a good scare for the kids, not a docudrama.<br/><br/>Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."

"datorsiers2","5","0","0","24 September 2017"," A great start to a downhill spiral.
","The movie begins with another clever marketing pitch by James Wan trying to mix Amityville horror in here just like he did with ''Annabelle'', well not that it is horrible, but still seemed quite irrelevant. The beginning is not horrible, rather fast paced, the viewers got to see paranormal activity quickly, which carried on for a good while.<br/><br/>What i found really weird was the movie coming to a massive stall in the middle of everything, i do not think i have experienced something quite like this in a film before. In my opinion it was just another cheap shot at extending the screen time, which panned out to be rather sizeable. The first hour had a couple of interesting and witty jump scares, which were quite original and definitely one of the greatest things about this film. Then after we arrive at around the half way mark everything slows down and it seems as if everything has taken a turn and the premise and fast pace of this film have been discarded, which is a massive flop of course.<br/><br/>There is a scene in the film, which is going to make any experienced horror film fan cringe, at this point i had to start heavily re-evaluating my thoughts about the film. There is a scene where a dog transforms into the ''crooked man'', from a kids toy game, the monster was a really poor work of cgi, which did absolutely no justice to the tone and tensity the movie had set prior to the scene, it was really cringy, not scary at all and very childish. However, by far the greatest upset for me was the extremely boring and poorly thought through ending. The insanely powerful demon that can easily do anything it wants, including teleportation, transcending time and destroying everything in its way can be destroyed and sent to hell forever by saying its name 2 times? This had me laughing, such a week ending, well at least it was unpredictable, people like unpredictability when it comes to horror films, right? <br/><br/>Overall the film starts out great and slowly goes downhill as it progresses. It escalates from witty, unpredictable jump scares and intense atmosphere to lousy cgi work and laughable kindergarten horror, culminating in one of the worst horror film endings i have ever seen in my life. 5/10 for the great first half of this film."

","I don't get scared by horror movies, but I've enjoyed this series because of the emphasis on likable characters, from the family to ghost-investigator couple. These are good stories, with believable relationships between family members who care about each other, not simply a bunch of jump-scares (although there's that too).<br/><br/>As good as the first one was, it was narratively a fairly simple & straightforward haunted house story. I'd rate this one, the sequel, a little bit better because, although featuring a similar premise, it actually goes in a few unexpected directions and introduces additional hurdles for our protagonists.<br/><br/>This one also clearly has a bigger effects budget, which doesn't hurt. Many of the effects are really quite creative and visually impressive (e.g., a girl slowly transforming into someone else the unfocused/blurry background); but also some that look a bit more silly than scary (e.g., the Crooked Man)."

","The Conjuring 2 celebrates horror in a new taste. It's a successful extension the original movie. Director James Wan knows his viewers and he toys with their 'fairy tale nightmares' as Vera Farmiga remarks it in this sequel. This time the story's set in a council home in England and it's about a poltergeist that torments a family of five. The Warrens this time get into things more gruesome than the last one. James Wan has not taken the recognition of his last work for granted. With this Conjuring he has gone to experiment with his core film making and he's successful in all ways. Actors are all brilliant. Vera Farmiga is a beautiful artist who lives the character of Lorraine. Patrick Wilson, this time is at his best and he totally nails the character of Ed. Young Madison Wolfe is a talent to look out for. She's vulnerable and worth-getting-scared-of at the same time. Overall the movie is worth the hype. The length of the movie however, could have been curtailed but still it doesn't stop this thriller from being one of the best horror movies of all time."
"brando647","8","0","0","26 August 2017"," A Superior, Scarier Film than the Original CONJURING
","I don't generally put a whole lot of faith into horror sequels. More often than not, they're just trying to recreate the success of what made the first film popular and fail to bring anything new to the table. So many of them are unapologetic cash-grabs that I often won't pay attention to news that sequels are in the pipeline, even when I enjoyed the first film. I thought INSIDIOUS was a creepy, fun little film but I never once cared about the second chapter and still haven't bothered to see it. Until just a moment ago, I was completely unaware that there has, in fact, been a third chapter and there's a fourth in production. Speaking of James Wan and Patrick Wilson, the first CONJURING was another decent horror. I think it was over-hyped and I might've gone in with my expectations a little high, but I enjoyed it. I had zero interest in the idea of a second film, believing they'd gone the route of every other successful horror with a seemingly never-ending explosion of sequels and spin-offs (for the record, I never saw ANNABELLE and have no desire to do so) but I was caught off-guard when THE CONJURING 2 started receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and in the end I'm glad I did because I'm actually of the opinion that THE CONJURING 2 is superior to the first film. So I suppose it's a rare exception to the rule.<br/><br/>THE CONJURING 2 revisits the case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two of the most famous paranormal investigators. It opens with a glimpse into their involvement in the investigation of the Amityville house, where Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) conducts a séance and comes face-to-face with some sort of evil spirit in the form of an evil nun. Unlike the first film where their Annabelle investigation was just a cold open to introduce the pair in action, the nun becomes an integral part of THE CONJURING 2, tormenting Lorraine long after finishing at Amityville with visions of Ed's (Patrick Wilson) death. It's her confrontation with the nun and these spectral threats that lead her to swearing off hands-on investigations, and she and Ed decide to limit their activity to seminars and interviews. Meanwhile, in England, a new supernatural occurrence has taken up residence in the home of a single mother and her four children. It's set its sights on the youngest daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), and it's not long before her over-stressed mother takes notice and affirms that this isn't a child's prank. Her family is being tortured nightly and Janet is suffering more and more as the entity breaks her spirit in hopes of possessing her body for its own purposes. The misery of a young child proves too much for Lorraine to turn away, and she and Ed jet off across the Atlantic to verify the poltergeist's existence and hopefully get the Catholic Church involved in exorcising the spirit.<br/><br/>The Enfield Poltergeist is apparently one of the more famous Warren investigations. I wasn't familiar with the details of it prior to this movie but I had seen the photographs of Janet's supposed levitations referenced before in my limited readings on the paranormal. Of course, the whole situation has been debunked as an attention-grabbing hoax but, for the purposes of this movie, it's all treated as gospel and it makes for a great movie. I remember the first film leaving me uneasy in a dark house when it ended but THE CONJURING 2 was way more effective at leaving me shaken. James Wan is a talented horror director and one of the few out there that can put together a strong ghost story without the reliance on shocking gore or over-used jump scare tactics. He uses camera lenses, lighting, film score, and the performances of his cast to build a sense of dread in a way that many other modern horror filmmakers wish they could. There's a little bit of questionable CG in the film when the spirit takes the form of a children's nursery rhyme named the Crooked Man but it's a minor misstep and I can forgive its cartoonish appearance because everything else works so well. The first CONJURING seems to have soaked all the hype but CONJURING 2 is the one that gets my respect. Fans of the first one won't be disappointed and, for once, I'm eager for a horror sequel and hope they continue digging through the Warrens' files with a CONJURING 3."

","It's very rare that a horror sequel outdoes its original, and The Conjuring 2 is one of those sequels. Don't get me wrong; The Conjuring (2013) was very scary with quality horror, great acting, and a great plot. But The Conjuring 2 surpasses the story line, overall quality, acting, and most importantly the terror. I'm a big fan of paranormal/horror films, especially those based on a true story and actual events. I loved The Conjuring (2013) so I just had to see The Conjuring 2. And let me tell you...I was blown away (and I had to keep the lights on in every room after watching it).<br/><br/>The film starts out with Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) conducting a seance at the Amityville house in 1977. Lorraine, a clairvoyant, astral projects and relives the horrific events - and comes face-to-face with a terrifying, demonic nun (who'll play a bigger role later on in the film). Meanwhile an equally- diabolic haunting is taking place in Enfield, England, where 11-year-old Janet Hodgson is being tormented by a ghost. Ed and Lorraine come to the rescue and things get frightening from there!<br/><br/>The first thing I must greatly compliment about this movie is the acting (especially Vera Farmiga's). I was very impressed at how much the cast looked so much like the original people and investigators involved. Each actor and actress was very passionate about their roles and they made things pretty intense - sometimes even emotional. I also loved the realistic visual effects that delivered the activity and scares. The sound editing was brilliant, the soundtrack was eerie and bone-chilling, and the costume design was great (I'm including the costume design because the actors wore what the original persons did during the investigations, making it all the more authentic). <br/><br/>Overall, The Conjuring 2 possesses a very eerie, creepy, haunting feeling throughout the film which is rare in today's world of horror movies. It makes you feel tense and uneasy during AND after watching it, as if something dark and inhuman is watching you. I had a hard time sleeping the night I watched it, which almost never happens to me as a die-hard Horror fan. You can tell director James Wan put a ton of time and quality in the making of this one, and recreating the horrific events that happened to Janet Hodgson in 1977. <br/><br/>FIVE STARS and 10/10! I highly recommend it! I can't wait for The Conjuring 3 as well as the confirmed spin-offs (""The Nun"" and ""The Crooked Man"")"

"Mike_Devine","7","0","0","16 July 2017"," James Wan surprisingly avoids sophomore slump on 'Conjuring 2'
","There are few horror films that have exceeded expectations in the past 20 years. In fact, you can probably count them on two hands. Most people would put 2013's simple-yet-striking spookfest 'The Conjuring' in this list, so it's hard to imagine any follow-up effort coming close to it in terms of quality.<br/><br/>Director James Wan clearly realized how important it was to live up to expectations, so he brought his A-game on 2016's 'The Conjuring 2,' which follows world-famous demonologists Ed and Lorraine as they investigate a media circus of a case of a haunted house in Enfield, England. While there's much criticism about the veracity of the story, and the level to which the Warrens were involved in the case, this doesn't change the quality of the film.<br/><br/>In 'Conjuring,' we once again get to see Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (both of whom are modern-day scream kings/queens by this point) reprise their roles, and while there are a few other key actors who are key here, particularly Madison Wolfe as the young Janet Hodgson and Frances O'Connor as her mother, Peggy), it's really the ""Patrick and Vera show"" once again. They both deliver strong performances and are the best part about the film. That said, as you would expect, the thrills and chills sent up audiences' spines are also key, and somehow the ones dished out in this film are on the same level as those in its predecessor. Sure, there are a lot of commonly used techniques like shaky cam, quick transitions, etc., but they are done so well here and do not feel cheap at all.<br/><br/>Additionally, the soundtrack and sound effects really bring 'Conjuring' to life, as any haunted house movie would rely on. But the main reason this film lives up to expectations is because it has a strong script. From some lighter moments to many tense ones where there are life-and-death situations, it really is all in the script and the screenplay.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring 2' proves that breakout horror films are not always a fluke - it's possible to build a successful franchise that resonates with audiences."

","I was incredibly impressed by the way this movie kept the same general theme, vibe, and strength of scares as its predecessor, while also being fresh and adding just the right changes to subvert expectations. I also loved how they actually called the police this time, and based on the common sense theory that some sinister prankster was behind everything. Although the mother really should have thought about that. But whatever, at least someone acted rationally, which is incredibly rare in horror films. I was then impressed again by the fact that paranormal events happened while the police were there. Words can't describe how satisfying and refreshing that was to see.<br/><br/>The only thing that really bothered me about this movie, was the part where everyone suddenly concluding that all the hauntings were fake, due to one incident. In what universe would a rational thinking adult believe that a little girl could fake everything that happened? That scene was so frustrating.<br/><br/>However, the aforementioned weakness was connected to a strength in this film. I loved that Loraine wasn't able to see the demon. That is something I didn't expect. The way they found out later why she couldn't see the demon, was also a very exiting addition to the story.<br/><br/>The ending of this film is a big improvement over The Conjuring. Mainly in the sense that the final battle with the demon was shorter. These final battles, where the demon fully possesses someone, aren't as scary for me. Demon's are more scary to me when they aren't in a physical form, because things that I can't see scare me the most. At the point of possession, I don't see a demon, just a crazy acting human that my brain associates with someone with a mental health problem."

","I enjoyed the first conjuring movie well enough but I wasn't dying to see the follow-up. It's a surprisingly good sequel that impressed me more than the first one.<br/><br/>There is a simple enough setup of Loraine and Warren once again going to investigate a haunted house. I think what I like the most about how James Wan starts horror movies is that he really sets the mood. By showing the characters reacting to spirits or scary things going on then we start to get a sense of the state of mind that they get put in.<br/><br/>I love how this movie is shot. With the prevalence of shaky cam and found footage horror movies it's almost refreshing to see long crane cam shots and just an overall clarity how everything is presented. Many horror and suspense movies lean on having cameras wobbling around to create confusion and try and feel scary. His horror movies feel more like he's trying to pull you and make you feel what the characters are feeling.<br/><br/>My one big complaint is the running time. When a movie is asking for more than 2 hours of my attention it better have no pacing issues. The pacing does dip a bit in the 3rd act but the final 30 minutes mostly make up for it.<br/><br/>I hope James Wan makes at least one more of these after Aquaman because these movies are a lot of fun in a way most directors can't come close."

","Conjuring 2 was arguably the most interesting horror film that came out last year. Recently, most horror films have been using all kinds of special effects that didn't fit the genre of horror film due to its outlandish way of portraying supernatural entities (ghosts, monsters etc.) which ultimately hinders the scary factor of the genre. Compared to another horror sequel which I have watched called Sinister 2 and various other horror films released within a year with Conjuring 2, I can say that the movie has done well in delivering the right atmosphere for its genre. I watched this movie as a group in a film club for our school and I'd like to say that we were pretty scared. Some Korean students have expressed that Western horror films are exceptionally different from East Asian horror films. They are more focused towards Christianity and religious storyline while the East Asian horror films are heavily reliant on revenge/vengeance type of plot development. All in all, Conjuring 2 was a decent horror film compared to a recent surge of terribly made horror films, but they certainly have areas that they can improve on."

","Modern day compositions seem to lack the element of refinement with patience... Everything is so fast that in a couple of years a good number of practices and ways will be altered with speed for the sake of non-persistent productions. And the horror genre, in the field of cinema, has been exposed to this tendency the most.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this movie tries to whip off the horror genre. Not because of its strong originality, but because of its devoutness in cinematography, screenplay, and acting.<br/><br/>Not only the lead actors are of the best quality, especially Ms. Vera Farmiga, but the rest of the actors helped it seem like the story actually ""was"" taking place when we see it.<br/><br/>The scenes were prepared carefully along with the unvarnished, austere movements and shots of the camera.<br/><br/>The screenplay was originally derived from a true story, yeah. But it is not the sole reason behind the success. In fact, the writers changed it a lot to the point that it had cooperativeness, helpfulness and love that was missing from the original story at the time of which the people and the media treated the Hodgson family as zoo animals.<br/><br/>Okay. Time for truth... <br/><br/>Every horror fan knows that a good horror movie should scare us really well and be of originality doing it. But if we look at randomly selected 100 movies, we were to see that most of them chooses a way that contains emetic amount of blood, stupid decisions, musical pieces that were composed rather by chance, the showing up of the killer out of thin air irrationally when you least expect it, the appearance of the killer / the monster after the character(s) cuts in the frame and thereafter steps aside, etc... We could really go on...<br/><br/>But this one kept as far away from these commonplaces as possible. Of course it is not a huge success for that matter. But their centering the story not around the horror but around love is the real achievement of this movie.<br/><br/>For I would not find anyone that won't notice the love between the lead characters and their compassion towards people (in need). That is what the world needs. Yep!<br/><br/>I will give this movie a ""8,2"". Yes. Love.<br/><br/>Hey Mr. Patrick Wilson! Hey Ms. Vera Farmiga!..

"PureLombardi","7","0","0","6 February 2017"," An Odd Case of well-made Hollywood Horror
","Attempts to make horror franchises usually flop in terms of quality. Sequels of classic or modern greats such as Halloween and Paranormal Activity, despite being financially successful, fail to critically impress, unlike their predecessors. This might be because they are retreading the same solidified steps, or that the director had changed from the first. And although director James Wan made a lacklustre attempt at his Insidious sequel, he recaptured the spirit of The Conjuring with its sequel, The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case. <br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 follows paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) yet again as they set out to help another family plagued by malevolent spirits. This time, the factually based haunting is set in the titular London Borough of Enfield, England. <br/><br/>70's London adds a layer of splendour to the film. Everything from that era is nailed - from the fashion to the old-styled accents. What is also faithful is the case itself and the people involved. Actors were specifically hired to look like their real life counterparts and most of the events from the case are virtually re-enacted from witness descriptions. Even the haunted house and its properties look the same, which makes for a lot of believability for those who are familiar with the story. <br/><br/>By focusing on a case outside the US, the film differentiates itself from the first straight away. However, as is the curse of the horror sequel as previously mentioned, the film retreads many stylistic titbits of Wan's earlier works. One example of this is when a demon points ominously to the desired victim - the same motif used in Insidious. The Conjuring 2's antagonist also looks strikingly similar to 'The Bride in Black' in Insidious, but other than that, Wan uses his one-of-a-kind horror filmmaking skill to craft something that stands out in his filmography.<br/><br/>The tension in the second outing is on par with the original. Wan uses audiences' expectation and paranoia to carefully execute effective scares. There are moments that build to nothing, in the beginning, playing on fears of the dark and of unusual sounds with fantastic lighting. As the events occur, they become increasingly more violent and scarier. Sometimes, though, the film becomes zany and not as believable as the first. Wan once stated that he prefers to leave things to the audience's imagination, but more is revealed in this film. I also have a problem with the amount of CGI as practical effects look more believable.<br/><br/>Wan's experience with The Fast & Furious franchise carries its silver linings here in the form of more energetic cinematography (solidly taken care of by Don Burgess). Camera movements are superb and invigorating, with the tracking shots being a highlight throughout the director's career. He includes them better than ever before, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats as we follow our protagonists through to whatever lies ahead. Joseph Bishara once again helms the score - the scariest aspect of his films. Percussions, strings, and haunting choirs are used to punctuate The Conjuring 2's disturbing imagery to maximum shock and discomfort. I do not know if I would be scared at all if this unbearably frightening score was not included.<br/><br/>Farmiga is the star of the show here and Wilson holds his own too. I am glad the Warrens continue to develop, as they are becoming even more empathetic and compelling this time around. Most importantly, they actually seem quite vulnerable. In the finale, you feel like anything could happen to these characters, which I personally found exciting. <br/><br/>While The Conjuring 2 cannot compete with its predecessor's subtlety and innovation, it serves as the cherry on top to James Wan's title: this generation's most consistent horror director. See it for some of the best thrills of the year"

","It seems like a ton of horror movies come out every year, and most times, they don't live up to their potential. There are a handful of horror movies over the last decade that really satisfy us horror fans. Films like 'The Babadook', 'It Follows', and 'The Conjuring' will still be talked about for years to come. One name in the horror genre, or at least in recent years is James Wan. This man burst onto the scene with 'Saw', which was basically genre changing and spawned a ton of sequels. Wan also made a few other horror films, all testing the bounds and pushing us into a new horror direction, while still respecting his influences.<br/><br/>I can easily say that James Wan's name belongs up there with the likes of John Carpenter and Stephen King. The guy knows horror and how to execute it so well that his images will continue to haunt for many years to come. I'm glad he signed on to take on the Ed and Lorraine Warren investigations some years ago and gave us 'The Conjuring' and now 'The Conjuring 2', which was previously titled 'The Enfield Poltergeist'. If you're unfamiliar with Ed and Lorraine Warren, these are two real-life people who were paranormal investigators and professors, who helped a lot of people from hauntings and possessions.<br/><br/>Perhaps their most famous investigation was 'The Amityville Horror', which is where 'The Conjuring 2' starts out, as Ed and Lorraine Warren are investigating the house a few months after the Lutz family moved out. It's here that Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) has a vision of something so sinister, that she makes her husband Ed (Patrick Wilson) promise that they are done with these investigations. That's when things start to go awry over in England at the Hodgson residence where things go bump in the night and then some, as the mother Peggy Hodgson and her four young kids are subjected to moving furniture, screams, and much more.<br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine hear of this and set out to England to help out, despite their previous promise, and then all hell breaks loose – literally. Running at over two hours, there are certain times where 'The Conjuring 2' seems like its doing too much, but there is nothing bad about the movie really. It's just that we're put through so much suspense, horror, and terror, that by the final act, we are glad it's over with. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes you exhausted by the end. Director James Wan is true modern master of horror. He uses the usual horror genre tropes, but makes them relevant and fresh all over again, whether it be a child hiding under the covers while something is hovering over you, or a possessed toy, and even ghostly visions.<br/><br/>Most of these moments will leave a lasting and terrifying impression that will make it difficult to sleep at night, particularly a certain beastly nun. I still get shivers thinking about it. Wan also adds some comedy here, but is used sparingly, and is relegated to the time period. It was a nice breath from all the intense horror that was going on in the film. The score is fantastic and adds to every single moment of terror. It's incredible that these stories are real and that you can actually research them, and Wan does an incredible job of adapting the material and making it entertaining and scary-as-hell. 'The Conjuring 2' is a fantastic sequel and is an instant horror classic.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

In comparison I think the first movie was great. For people who do not care much about the source of the story, this should still be quite watchable.

","The Conjuring 2 is a really good horror movie you should as fan must see. <br/><br/>All I had in the beginning the feeling it corresponded over with Insidious. it is actually a kind of the same story so it can be right.

I found the film very believable. But the only thing i was missing was more information about the head (demon) person in the story because it was more about ""poltergeist"" and the family. (Sorry still a small spoiler) I found the location very suited to the film.

","Finally, a true horror film. No starlets losing their tops running around aimlessly. This had a good plot, great film work, excellent suspense and a few well-deserved jump scares. Although some of the CG seemed low budget, I do believe it was certainly meant to come off that way based on the subject. Wilson and Farmiga create characters that are adaptable and believable. The supporting cast as well were very strong and created a true empathetic connection. It is a rare feat these days to create a creepy movie with strong character performances that do not not rely solely on CG or jump scares. If you are in the mood for a real horror movie, this just might fit your style perfectly. Very enjoyable."

","As you know, I'm a huge horror movie fan and when I'm watching a horror film I expect nothing but the best and ""The Conjuring 2"" did not let me down! It pretty much had the same scare factor as ""The Conjuring"", which that film was a great one too. You have to have some skills in film making in order to have the sequel just as good or better than the original and ""The Conjuring 2"" is just as good as the original. The story-line and plot were solid and the creepiness throughout the film was on point. Another good thing about this film is that there are a couple of twists that kind of make it a little different from the first but at the same time it doesn't veer off from the same formula that made ""The Conjuring"" so good. The director of this film knows just how much scare and creepiness to put in a horror film without going overboard with it or not putting enough in it to render it boring with set up stories and dialog. If you're a horror movie fan, like me, and you really enjoyed the prequel to this film I highly recommend seeing this one."

"SquigglyCrunch","8","0","0","19 December 2016"," A Vast Improvement Over the Original
","The Conjuring 2 follows the Warren couple as they discover another family is being haunted and sets out to help them, meanwhile spiritual troubles have started with themselves. <br/><br/>Personally I didn't care for the first movie that much. I thought it was largely cheap horror without much substance. The sequel, however, takes everything it predecessor did right, then puts it into a much better movie. <br/><br/>Similar to the last movie, the performances are all good. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson continue to be great, but another standout was Frances O'Connor. She plays the mother of the haunted family, and she does a dang good job of it. The kids are good too, most notably Madison Wolfe, who plays the girl the ghost primarily goes after. <br/><br/>Unlike it's predecessor, this movie is actually pretty unnerving throughout. The movie takes a similar approach to the original where it develops both the Warrens outside the haunting and those who are haunted before ultimately bringing them together. It works very well here, and the movie is much more upfront with it's scares, yet it's not really over-the-top for the first half. As such, we see the family's relationships get tested, and it develops and makes the audience care much more for them. So each scare becomes that much more effective. Even without that, the movie is creepy. It uses the fear of the unknown very well, and builds up a tense atmosphere with immense payoff. <br/><br/>Speaking of the payoff, the climax is outstanding. The first movie had a notably good climax, and for me that more or less saved the film. Here, it's even better. It's longer, and thus the tension builds more. And there are aspects that are hinted at (or more, outwardly stated) earlier in the movie, so when those aspects present themselves it only makes it better. I was on the edge of my seat, and while I was sure I knew the ending, I wasn't completely certain. And that's another thing I loved about this movie. <br/><br/>The movie is great with it's mystery. Towards the end especially I began to question it, and while I was sure I knew what was going to happen, again, I wasn't completely certain. The movie had proved itself to be pretty brave thus far, who knows? Maybe it would turn everything on it's head. <br/><br/>The first act is brilliantly shot. It features several noticeably long takes, and it further shows just how much skill went into this movie. Unfortunately those shots do take a dip in the last portion, or maybe they became less noticeable once the story picked up, but regardless it was a treat to see this level of skill from a director. <br/><br/>Overall The Conjuring 2 is somehow not only a good horror sequel, but a great one. It's a beautifully shot, genuinely unnerving, well- performed horror that I had a blast with. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, and in the end I would definitely recommend it."
"MF210","9","0","0","12 December 2016"," Contains a few missteps that its predecessor avoided, but still a genuinely terrifying film
","Contains Spoilers <br/><br/>James Wan's 2013 film, The Conjuring, was one of the best horror films I have ever seen. To this day, there are still scenes that I struggle to watch because they are so terrifying. The film was one of those rare modern horror films that generated scares without excessive gore and cheap ""boo"" moments. When I heard Wan was creating a sequel I was skeptical because The Conjuring simply did not need one. When I saw the trailer I was underwhelmed and not looking forward to the film, but because I loved the first film so much and respect Wan's skill as filmmaker I would give it a chance. The Conjuring 2 is one of those films where you absolutely cannot judge it by its trailer.<br/><br/>When it comes to genuine terror, The Conjuring 2 is a slight step below its predecessor but it is ever so slight. I've watched this film twice since I saw it in the theater and, like its predecessor, I still struggle to watch certain scenes. The opening scene where the Demon is first revealed, countless scenes in the Hodgson household, and the absolutely terrifying scene with Lorraine and the Demon in the Warren's house. Wan knows how to generate atmosphere and chills, that skill is on full display in the Conjuring 2.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of this sequel is there is an added element of skepticism. I never knew anything about this haunting before but it seems like there was a great deal of skepticism surrounding it. That skepticism is addressed in the film. Unlike its predecessor, where the Warrens believed the Perron family from the outset, the Warrens have their doubts about the events occurring in the Hodgson household. The evidence they are presented with isn't convincing to them and Lorraine never can sense an evil presence until the very end. The fact that there is another character who is skeptical of the claims and remains unconvinced only makes this element more intriguing.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 does fall short in a couple areas compared to its predecessor. For instance, regardless of whether or not the events that happened with the Perron family were true or not, The Conjuring presented them to the audience in a way where they seemed believable. Aside from the using paranormal activities (the daughter being thrown across the room), there was nothing so outrageous that I wouldn't believe that what I saw couldn't have happened. The Conjuring 2 does not capture that as well when it introduces ""The Crooked Man."" Not only is the CGI cheesy here, there's nothing remotely creepy about this ""ghost."" It is lame and bordering on mildly humorous, and just doesn't fit in with the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Also, there is the issue of how the demon is defeated at the end. The demon is disposed of in exactly the same way as Bathsheeba was at the end of The Conjuring. However, there is a big difference between the two films; Bathsheeba never told the Warrens her name! If a demon can be sent back to hell simply by saying its name then why did it tell Lorraine its name! It doesn't make any sense and it does somewhat diminish the ending.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, The Conjuring 2 is still an excellent horror film and if it weren't for those two flaws, this would be a flawless horror film. As it stands, Wan has created a worthy sequel and an incredible one-two punch in modern horror. I don't know if there will be a Conjuring 3, but with Wan at the helm, I'd certainly be excited for I!"

","Slightly better first half. Those 20 extra minutes alone make all the difference when compared to the original. Then gets progressively worse as it goes on. And frankly, the crooked man is the lowest point...absolutely no reason for its existence, who the hell was craving for awful cgi? I do like the first one. Its unfortunate that Ed and Lorraine have to be mentioned. Every time they have to be on screen, the movie takes a hit. They are huge frauds, why use their real names? Anyway, this one is a series of clever ideas that serves as a build up for what major audience wants. And what they want is a ton of crap of Jumpscares. Little side note. Conjuring 2 is set in London (1977) but they used London Calling from 79 for the establishing shot."

","From scares like a creepy toy that plays ""The Crooked Man"" to a phantom nun with yellow eyes, the Conjuring 2 will please horror fans many times over. Furthermore, I hope a third sequel gets made soon!<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, this movie features a story about the Warrens. In real-life, Ed Warren was a WWII Naval officer who, after the war, became a self-taught demonologist alongside his wife Lorraine who is a self- described clairvoyant among other titles. They are highly documented investigators of the paranormal. Ed is the only non-ordained demonologist, or one who performs exorcisms, recognized by the catholic church. They have published many of their famous investigations and claim to have done tens of thousands of them. In the film, Patrick Wilson plays Ed and Vera Farmiga plays Lorraine. The movie is based on their experience with The Enfield Poltergeist.<br/><br/>Director James Wan is well known for scaring moviegoers. His Saw and Insidious franchises have netted hefty sums from the wallets of people looking for that thing they've never seen before. He's a master craftsman of the horror genre. There isn't nearly as much blood and gore in The Conjuring 2 as you will find in Saw movies. Still, there are well crafted scares throughout. A spinning toy that sings ""The Crooked Man"" is part of one scare that has stayed with me.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga does an excellent job as Lorraine Warren. You can see in her eyes and movement she has such a profound love and respect for her husband. When he picks up the guitar at one point to bring some peace and music to the haunted place, she is just as captivated with him as the daughters are. It's interesting how Ed in many ways is the hero of The Conjuring 2. When I saw the first film, I didn't know he was a real person. Knowing a little about Ed Warren's history helped me appreciate him immensely in the second film. There is a lot of info on the internet and the Warrens even have their own website that is still up today. Ed has passed on but Lorraine is still with us. She speaks about her paranormal experiences at various events. This film concerns the possession of a young girl and how her family saves her with the help of the Warrens.<br/><br/>conjuring1<br/><br/>There is no doubt there will be another sequel since there are other stories about the Warrens that remain to be told. I think the first two in the franchise are both very scary horror movies with interesting real- life foundations. Because I was shocked and thrilled, The Conjuring 2 loses no stars from me. I highly recommend it to horror fans.<br/><br/>Below is a real treat, an interview with the Hayes Brothers, the writers of the 2 Conjuring films."
"IMDbUser1002","9","0","0","19 November 2016"," A Great paranormal horror movie!
","The Conjuring 2 is a very well-made horror movie, and a well made movie in general. One of the best that I've seen. It does an excellent job of making you think about what's really going on, and what's behind the haunting. While Lorraine's visions of an evil-looking nun become more threatening, and while the apparition that torments the family has no visible similarities, who's responsible for the haunting becomes more and more questionable. The movie is as good as the first Conjuring, and maybe more scary. The movie has a less creepy atmosphere since it's based in a very urban area (London, England) whereas the first movie as a house in the middle of the woods. Both movies are based around a haunting usually occurring inside a single house, both haunting cases escalate to a possession. The Conjuring 2 has a few more jump scares. I'd say the jump scares in The Conjuring 2 were scarier than the ones in The Conjuring. If you like scary movies, are if you loved the first Conjuring movie, than this is a very good film to watch! Be prepared to have sleepless nights! I rate 9/10"

The second one however was really scary,because when you're in London,everything is scary as it is. Same with Japan. I thought everything about this movie was all creative,scary,and as imaginative as I actually didn't think it would be. In the first one I saw they had Annabelle and made it into a decent movie. I also saw they added a specific witch named Bathsheba and she's an actual witch for real as I heard.Also of course a few lost souls and that was it. For the second one,they added a nun which was creepy,also and old man which was also creepy,but the one that was the most creepiest is the Crooked man. I have so many ideas for him,because they didn't show him much which is a great opportunity to make ideas of my own.The conjuring 2 was really creative and really scary."
"tomgillespie2002","4","0","0","9 November 2016"," More of the same, only longer, duller and less frightening
","With The Conjuring leaving theatres in 2013 as one of the highest- grossing horror movies of all time, it was of no surprise when director James Wan announced that he was going to helm a sequel, despite claiming to be done with the genre. The first movie was a stylish alternative to the blood-spattered torture porn and CGI- laden exorcism drivel that grace our screens every year (although it featured quite a bit of the latter), and a loving wink to the creepier, more slow-burning supernatural tales of the 1970's. The sequel keeps the 70's aesthetic, but sadly everything else too. And this time it's longer, duller and far less frightening.<br/><br/>It's London, 1977, and the Hodgson family move into a ramshackle council house in Enfield and quickly start experiencing paranormal occurrences. Janet (Madison Wolfe), one of two daughters, is tormented by the apparition of an old man, and furniture regularly flies across the room. The events quickly attract the attention of the police, reporters and sceptics, and word eventually travels across the pond to paranormal investigators Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson). Lorraine is battling against her own visions of a ghostly nun and the death of her husband, but the couple decide to investigate nonetheless. Soon enough, the Warrens uncover sinister forces at work at the Hodgson's home.<br/><br/>The first film was such an astounding success that it would seem that Wan and his four writers were simply terrified to change the formula, while bending to the fact that the audience will no doubt be expecting the ante to be upped significantly. So we are again hampered by a distracting side-story involving a previous investigation by the Warrens,as the film begins in Amityville, a story which the 2005 version starring Ryan Renyolds should have ensured wouldn't litter our screens again for at least two decades. A troubling seance seems to unleash a p****d-off, creepy nun onto Lorraine, and this story thread is shoe-horned into the central plot. Much of the first third is spent switching between continents as the Hodgsons and Warrens go about their business oblivious to the other's existence in a clunky style that doesn't really gel.<br/><br/>On the spooky side, it's obvious that Wan has a real knack for sculpting a set-piece, He understands the effect that a creaking floorboard, a dark corner of a room, or just plain silence can have on an audience, but Wan doesn't seem to have the discipline he had first time around. Chilling slow walks across a darkened landing soon give way to jump-scares you can spot a mile away, a spirit with a daft Cockney accent, and most inexplicably, a giant CGI 'Crooked Man'. There's a limit to how many you can be asked to watch a character make the same daft mistakes (why doesn't somebody just turn a light on at least?) or watch the so-called experts deny what is right in front of their eyes despite years of experience. And at 134 minutes, it asks you to do this for a long time. I must be missing something, as The Conjuring 2 has been another huge financial success, but I see little here that I haven't seen a hundred times before."

","I have to admit, I wasn't The Conjuring's (2013) biggest fan. The film felt like yet another possession story that has been told in a very similar way since The Exorcist (1973). The jump scares were there and provided everyone in the theater a good spook, but the cliché nature of the film prevented from rating it anything other than O.K. James Wan's The Conjuring 2 is very much a story told in the same way as the previous film. Ed and Lorraine Warren are once again sent on task to aid a family being haunted by a truly terrifying demon. There are far more twists and turns to this iteration in The Conjuring series than its previous entry., but the most amusing part of this film is Wan's wonderful recreation of 1970's England. The Hodgson family is in great distress by the time the Warren's arrive, and sure enough, this films demonic presence doesn't like it. What transpires is a jumpy and at times horrific demon tale that is far from original. <br/><br/>The movie progresses very much like the first entry and the acting throughout the film is serviceable if not mediocre at times. Thankfully, Wan pulls us into the horror immediately, leaving us on pins and needles for the films surprisingly lengthy run time (2+ hours). You are definitely getting a lot of scare for your buck, which is arguably the films greatest accomplishment. Many modern horror films run under 90 minutes, so a lengthy ghost tail is a treat. While the demon possession story has been told many times, the consistently ominous tone of the film is no joke. Wan's camera-work is wonderfully traditional for a horror film, full of close ups and some well planned continuous shots. The film ends abruptly and without much resolution, its hard not to wish there was a bit more put into the concluding moments. I don't how many more of these films in The Conjuring series can be made before they are cast aside a repetitive, but as long as Wan is behind the camera, its worth giving it a try <br/><br/>7/10 - Good"

They just don't do it for me, at all.<br/><br/>There were so many moments in this flick where I caught myself rolling my eyes. Oof. And for me that's the kiss of death for any movie, much less one that's supposed to scare the pants off me.<br/><br/>WAY too many GTFO (get the frack out) moments in Conjurer 2. Why oh WHY do these characters persist in peering into darkened kids' tents, walking through doors that mysteriously cre-e-e-eak open, and then go flogging about in dimly lit basements? <br/><br/>We all know nuns are evil, so what's the big reveal about that? And where did that one guy in the red hat (not the Crooked Man guy) suddenly come into the story?<br/><br/>There was only one moment during the viewing when I felt the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. One. I felt everything else was far too ""seen this one before"" and ""here we go again"" substandard schlock. The Disney happy music at the very end of the film was really just the perfect nail in the coffin. How corny. (Where did the daughter of the Warrens get off to when Mummy and Daddy were celebrating their big win, anyway? Doesn't she like to dance to Elvis music, too?)<br/><br/>Want to see a scary movie? Watch ""Bone Tomahawk."" Now that's a creative and especially scary flick. The Conjuring 2? Yawn."

","Rarely does a big time director of a hit horror movie come back and make a direct sequel to his work. James Wan seems to take up this challenge and it's refreshing that he has the desire to continue his original story with another solid outing. It almost seems that The Conjuring franchise is quickly becoming on the level of the The Exorcist franchise, in terms of story and film quality in the possession genre. Wan's ability to create a frightening film relatable on a human level is a remarkable talent. An initial strength of The Conjuring 2 is how topical the premise is to the actual landscape of paranormal perception. For example, an important part of any real-life exorcism is the doubt that the vast majority of people view towards the subject in question, in this case a girl played by a good upcoming talent, Madison Wolfe. The Conjuring 2 outlines the media scrutiny towards exorcisms very well and also the genuine nature and belief in the paranormal field by strong grounded people. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are simply incredible in these roles, flat-out polished acting chops and never wilt once on screen. A well-written story, strong cast and crew and hair raising scenes and dialogue it's really not that surprising to see The Conjuring 2 crush at the box office as well as critical reviews."

If you looked into the 'real' story over the years, with great care, director James Wan touches on soooo much of the already documented research: The way the kids look/behave, Maurice the researcher, the constables, the way the townhouse is layed out and it's decaying condition - almost exactly like its event from the 1970s. Then, yes, he adds amped-up effects and situations (that didn't happen) to make a fun film and very aggressive. <br/><br/>Wan employs excellent, alluring cinematography with the situations, careful shadows, and kinetic editing that cares about his characters & sets up the wicked scares; you must watch this in widescreen or you miss a lot.

Mother and children in a house where it happens scary stuff. Many well-used but effective effects makes you cringe properly several times. Just like we will have a good horror movie. I also think it is a good choice to move the story from the US to London. It breaks well with the first film. Unfortunately, I think the last part of the film is not as good, unfortunately. The story is too complicated, and horror effects become too exaggerated, in my opinion. I also think the end, the settlement with evil was something strange. But this film is not bad in any way. I only wish it would hold the suspense up all along. Nevertheless this is one of the better ones in its genre, and it will probably continue to entertain fans of such movies.

","Following the cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two psychic investigators, this sequel pits the duo against a demonic entity haunting a small Enfield home in London. Despite Lorraine's worry that their jobs put them in harms way, Ed is still eager to save desperate families from their spiritual issues and they are convinced by the church to head to England to assess the Hodgson's case. Is it fact or fiction? This is the question that the film threatens to delve down and if anything is the theme that could be of most interest. It is a different angle to other horror movies and could tip it to being more advanced then your typical scare-fest. However that theme is never developed and the story slowly evolves back into the less original frights. The story is slow moving, with the Warren's failing to really get involved until half way through, and actually isn't really very scary. When we start to unravel what the demon is it becomes a little laughable, making it less terrifying than it should have been. The performance of Madison Wolfe is a saving grace for this problem however. As the possessed child she brings a frightening presence more so than what the demons do. There are many good moments but it never delves as deep as what it should have done. If the Warrens were brought in earlier we could learn more about the family and the demons and understand more of what is disturbing Lorraine Warren, however we have two stories that collide when it is convenient for the plot. Characters are also too slow to react to situations, for instance a screaming toy fire truck fails to wake a house of three sleeping children, and solutions come by too easily, mainly through asking questions. James Wan is well known for his horror entries and to be fair his direction and choice of shots are chilling, however he struggles with the emotional moments. The soft score during these scenes is out of place and off tone. These moments are required but are not helped by being forced home. The Conjuring franchise is a step up from many horror films but this second entry could have gone further and never really does so."
"leonblackwood","7","0","0","23 October 2016"," Intense and pretty scary in places. 7/10
","Review: This movie did take some time to get going but once the plot unfolds, it's nearly as good as the first movie. I'm glad that the director got the same actors to play Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson), because the movie wouldn't have worked without them. The chemistry between the 2 actors is brilliant, and there demonising skills are truly remarkable. They never seem to panic under pressure, so when they get the call about a family in Enfield, England, who have a demon taking over the daughters body, they are straight on the case. With the media watching the house, the pressure is really on the couple from America, who struggle to believe that there is paranormal activity happening in the house. The single mother, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), tries everything to save her young daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), whilst struggling to pay for the roof over her head, and to feed her children. After seeing a tape of Janet faking an episode, Ed & Lorraine decide to leave London but Lorraine can feel that something is wrong. They then decide to go back to the house, and what they witness is truly out of this world. Basically, you have to watch the movie, especially as it's based on true events, to see the true impact of what the poor family had to go through. The bonus material is also pretty creepy, because you get to see the surviving family members, who say that the movie is very close to the events that happened in 1977. Anyway, although I preferred the original, I still enjoyed this film, and you can't help rooting for the family, who definitely wouldn't have made it without the help of Lorraine & Ed Warren. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I'm so glad that the director of the first movie, James Wan, 39, returned for this sequel, because he really did a great job, in terms of bringing the Warren's cases to the bring screen, and the intensity in both films where brilliant. At such a young age, Wan's first project Saw, which was released in 2004, made headlines in the movie world, and then he went on to direct Death Sentence, Dead Silence, Insidious 1&2, the original Conjuring and Fast & Furious 7. His next project is the highly anticipated Aquaman, with Jason Momoa playing the lead, so he certainly doesn't shy away from big budget projects. With the success of the Conjuring franchise, and Fast & Furious 7 being the 6th biggest movie of all time, he certainly has achieved a lot, so early in his career and I'm sure that Conjuring 3, if there is one, will be just as successful as the previous movies.<br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $370.2million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mystery/thrillers, starring Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor, Simon McBurney, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Franka Potente and Simon Delaney. 7/10"
"alishahmohd","8","0","0","21 October 2016"," A mesmerizing horror flick that is one of the better movie sequels in recent memory
","The Conjuring came out in the year 2013. It was a supernatural horror movie based on a real life incident, set in the 1970s, and it focused on the efforts of the demonologists Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren to help a distressed family get rid of an evil spirit, which had possessed one of the family members. The movie had its scary moments and was fun to watch from the start to the finish. The Conjuring received rave reviews from both critics and fans alike and was a commercial success. This left the audience craving for a sequel, and after the release of the somewhat disappointing spin-off movie called ""Annabelle"", the developers finally released the sequel called ""The Conjuring 2"" this year in 2016.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is a very similar movie to the first movie and follows a similar plot line. The movie is set three years after the first Conjuring and once again a family in distress is haunted by an evil spirit in their place of residence in England. The family begs for help for Ed and Lorraine Warren to help them, after it is obvious that the local authorities or the priests could not control the situation. What separates this plot line from the first movie is that this particular job is more personal for Lorraine and Ed Warren.<br/><br/>Much like the Conjuring, this movie is based on a real life case, although it has been glorified for theatrical and dramatic reasons to engross the audience. This movie actually comes off as more scary than the first movie, because the spirit or demon in this movie seems far more powerful and dangerous than the one the prequel and there is more focus on the horror sections as compared to the first movie. The first movie did very well due to its dramatic performances from the lead actors and comparatively was not that scary.<br/><br/>Performance wise, the cast does really well. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are almost perfect for the role of Lorraine and Ed Warren respectively and give their best effort. Madison Wolfe who plays the possessed girl Janet, also performs very well in her role. Frances O'Connor who plays the role of the mother of the children, also does an excellent job of playing the role of a mother who is traumatized with what has happened. The rest of cast also gives a commendable effort.<br/><br/>The sound effects of the movie are done remarkably well as they add to the horror element of the move and intensifies the scary moments in the movie to engage and gripe the audience, and this results in many nerve-racking moments throughout the entire movie. The movie is not heavy on special effects or gimmicks, the special effects are just on point and the creepy background and demonic voices only add to the horror element of the movie.<br/><br/>My main problem with the movie would be with the length, the movie goes longer than 2 hours and somewhat drags by the time it reaches the climax. The movie drags on so long is because of the heavy involvement of the media in it, some people in the media were hell bent on proving that the family was faking the incident. This movie could have done without these sections.<br/><br/>Overall the Conjuring 2 is a great supernatural horror movie and a great follow up to its predecessor. Nowadays, movie sequels hardly deliver and are more of a cash grab that is not the case with the Conjuring as the movie is arguably almost as good as or even better than the first movie, and in many instances also creepier than the first movie. This is a must watch for anyone who likes to watch horror movie, it would be a mesmerizing experience from the start to the finish."

","I was surprised to see this movie was rated slightly higher than the original and even more surprised at some of the reviews saying it was a masterpiece and one of the best horror sequels ever. <br/><br/>Then I started reading more reviews and saw more people saying what I felt: it just wasn't very good or scary. <br/><br/>The set up of the movie took way too long (the Warrens don't become involved until over the first hour mark) and the movie overall could've been trimmed down. <br/><br/>The old man IMO simply wasn't scary enough and the nun demon lost her luster as well. <br/><br/>The first Conjuring movie was scary as hell and had a good story. This one missed the mark and it seemed they were trying real hard to scare us. The long stick man was cringe worthy. <br/><br/>I held The Conjuring in high regard but this sequel brought the series down."

","The Conjuring 2.<br/><br/>James Wan is a genius. I'm just going to throw that out there. He builds tension like Alfred Hitchcock. He enjoys the long shot, similar to Martin Scorsese. There was a different style of horror in this film and it seems to have drawn its inspiration from Hideo Nakata's Ringu. By that I mean he plays with the audience. Building up all of this uneasy feeling only to have ultimately, nothing happen. Without feeling empty inside you feel shaken and scarred emotionally. I've said it before that: James Wan does perfect jump scares. To get you when you least expect it and to leave you wanting more when you do expect it. He never gives you the scare when you're expecting it though.<br/><br/>Enough fan-boying over James Wan, lets move on to Vera Farmiga who plays again Lorraine Warren, wife to Ed Warren. Vera is super expressive, which is probably why Scorsese picked her up for The Departed. <br/><br/>Patrick Wilson must have done something to make James Wan want him in so many of his films. I'm sure I have my research cut out for me to find out why. He's okay at acting, but I believe it's Wan's direction that really helps him out. I say that since I didn't enjoy his acting in Watchmen, Passengers, or Bone Tomahawk, and I loved Bone Tomahawk.<br/><br/>Madison Wolfe is going to be a star, oh wait, she already is. You probably just don't recognize her yet. She's phenomenal as the possessed child. Seriously look up the movies she's been in. <br/><br/>Because of the wonderful writing in the film. This has made me actually want to go watch House of Wax. One of the films I've avoided because of Paris Hilton. Carey Hayes wrote both Conjuring films and another film I liked called Whiteout.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is easily one of the best Horror movies this year, and could be considered one of the best horror sequel. Scream 2 being up there along with Halloween II. Aliens being my favorite horror sequel.<br/><br/>Verdict: Watch with someone who scares easily. If the name James Wan doesn't make you want to watch this movie then would it help if I called him a young Stephen King, John Carpenter, or Wes Craven?"

","Recently I had gotten the time to watch the sequel to The Conjuring ""The Conjuring 2 (2016)"" which by the trailers didn't quite look too par. After speaking with a lot of our followers and friends about the film, we decided to go for it since we enjoyed the first one.<br/><br/>I was told how scary this film was, though it did have it's moments but honestly I think part one was scarier. Many things rang a bell while watching as the layout and formatting of the film seem to coincide with the first as well, but The Conjuring 2 (2016) is certainly a great sequel. I tend to see things in film that tend to get missed, spots like the stage hands in green suites walking around etc; yes I saw a few of them though it doesn't stand out.<br/><br/>The brass tax of it all, The Conjuring 2 (2016) turned out to better than I had expected and that made me happier to see. I do believe they done great all the way through the film from start to finish in keeping the story moving with the vibe; the build was perfect. Definitely I'll buy The Conjuring 2 (2016) when it lands on DVD."
"abbeyroadliv","9","0","0","22 September 2016"," I have never been jumpscared that much in my life.
","I watched The Conjuring before it's sequel, and to be honest, although the first movie is scary based on it's aspects, the film sometimes fails to deliver a good jumpscare. Then, when I found out The Conjuring 2 just last year, I didn't want to watch it because I thought it would just recycle everything from it's prequel. But when I got the chance to actually watch it, I left my seat smiling, and scared, I called my mom to accompany me to a few dark spots around my house because I was too scared, which is embarrassing since I'm 16.<br/><br/>The Conjuring manages to turn a true story into something amazing, although at some point the film might have just a little clichés because you know what's gonna happen next, but it was the jumpscares that stole the show because you never know when or where they're gonna come out. A minute an environment becomes scary then calm, the next thing you know a demon jumps outta nowhere.<br/><br/>The cast was well acted, especially the young Madison Wolfe who plays Janet Hogdson in the movie. She's might be 12 or 13 during filming, and without a doubt, she can be an amazing actress in few years time. <br/><br/>If you expect the Conjuring 2 just to be your typical horror film, no, it's not. It's a great horror film recommendation for any horror film fan, and a great horror film for those teens who spends their nights with sleepovers while watching horror films. The Conjuring 2, I may sound insane, might be; one of the best horror films I've watched, and in the future, might be one of the greatest horrors of all time.<br/><br/>James Wan does another excellent job. I cannot wait for it's sequel."

","The Conjuring 2 is certainly a strong installment into the (hopefully) Conjuring series. Following the further cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the film takes us through one of the most famous hauntings in history - the Enfield Poltergeist. <br/><br/>The scares in this film are genuine (no cheap jump scares here!) with a particularly compelling story based on the true events that occurred in Enfield, England during the 70's. The tension that builds up during scenes is quite incredible, the imagery used to portray the demon that stalks the characters is pretty disturbing.<br/><br/>Of course, being a movie, The Conjuring 2 takes liberties with the ""true story"", which is especially obvious during the film's climax, but the whole film is competent enough to suspend your disbelief. I walked away and wanted to find out more about the true story, which I recommend you look up (Not for the film's sake but just because it's an interesting story in itself)! Overall, a strong, competent horror sequel with some genuine creepy thrills and a compelling story. Worth a watch!"

","Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga return to play real life, paranormal investigators Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren, respectively. This time, they help a family in England who claim to have an evil spirit in their house. Wilson and Farmiga are sent by the Catholic church to investigate and prove the claim false or true, and then let the church handle the rest. But what the married investigators discover will force them to go beyond their tasked duties and put one of them at risk of a horrible death.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Conjuring 2"" is the lengthy, opening sequence of the movie, when Wilson and Farmiga are investigating what is famously known as the Amityville Horror. This sequence is full of genuine frights, setting the tone for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>A true test of a horror movie's worth is its ability to provide true scares, and ""The Conjuring 2"" passes that test with flying colors. Yes, there is little here that most horror fans haven't seen before; but I dare you to watch this movie alone in the dark.

"peterp-450-298716","7","0","0","19 September 2016"," Once again a nice horror produced by Wan. But it didn't exceed the previous movie.
","""My name is Bill Wilkins. And I am 72 years old. Where you come from? I come from the grave.""<br/><br/>My wife was asking me already for weeks if we'd go watch ""Lights out"" in the cinema. Now, I really have no problem going to a cinema and watch a movie. Sitting in a cozy chair with a mega large popcorn and a maxi coke. Yet I wasn't so thrilled to go and see this one. Simply because my wife isn't such a fan of horror. It's a waste of money since my wife would watch it with her hands over her eyes all the time. So we compromised. What if we first tried ""The Conjuring 2"". From what I had read, ""Lights Out"" is much more intense and frightening than this sequel directed by James Wan. Let's call it an assessment test. Based on this test I'll decide whether or not we'll go and watch ""Lights out"".<br/><br/>Well, my wife failed the test (Can you believe that?). But I have to admit something. I was scared to death a few times. This was actually my wife's fault, whose screeching effortlessly exceeded that from an ordinary pig farm. There are indeed some strategic and perfectly timed frights in this movie, but overall I thought this film wasn't much better than its predecessor. Again Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are asked for their assistance, because there's somewhere a frenzied poltergeist who's driving a family nuts. So again it's a story based on true events (sigh). This time the story takes place in the United Kingdom. You can conclude the following. Not only in the U.S. people are being haunted by restless souls. And you can also state that there are civilians in the U.K. who make up such stuff due to lack of attention or intelligence.<br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine Warren are notorious for their paranormal investigations but won't get off scot-free. The stories of manipulations to get a bit of the media attention, ensure that the label ""true events"" will be treated with some skepticism. And also in this case, better known as ""The Entfield Haunting"", were some rumors that the whole story was financially advantageous for this poor family. There's one advantage though. We also get a nice, creepy horror once again. And Wan is also a master in finding the right balance for such a horror. Both seasoned horror fans as an occasional film viewer can find something to their liking in this film. The dangerous frontier of excess is never exceeded, so to speak. Again horror fans can prepare a comprehensive list of movies in which certain sequences of ""The Conjuring 2"" were used already before. In other words, nothing new under the sun.<br/><br/>The emphasis in this film lies on the threatening and gloomy atmosphere, without introducing bloody and gore scenes. This means that you'll be treated to some eerie fragments with spooky shadows, moving objects, scary sounds, banging on doors and even the manifestation of demonic possession. You can certainly expect some successful horror moments. They are as good as predictable, so I could warn my wife in advance (a waste of time anyway). But the absence of such a shock moment, is sometimes even more frightening. Despite its long running time, the film holds you in its grip the full two hours. Not only by the eerie moments, but also by the story about the interference of the church and the debacle about the veracity of Ed and Lorraine.<br/><br/>To be honest I thought this film met my expectations but didn't exceed the previous one. The demonic nun was more funny than frightening. Bill Wilkins, however, will scare the sh*t out of you. The cast was sublime. And not because of their performances, but because of their resemblance to the original persons who experienced this event. And if you don't believe me, you can check the original BBC documentary about The Entfield Haunting. Furthermore, the environment where everything happened looked gorgeous (a true vintage look with elements from the 70s) and everything was portrayed impeccably. For horror fans this is definitely a must. I'm sure we'll see a bunch of similar films, because Ed and Lorraine have compiled a whole series of similar disturbing incidents.

I really didn't see what else she was needed for. <br/><br/>The old man in the chair was a bit creepy. Even before the hauntings began though, I would have put the chair to the curb, and painted the wall behind it, since both were disgusting. <br/><br/>The relationship that the Warrens had with each other was nice, and I believed the love that they felt for each other. And it amused me that they just leave their daughter when they go on these long trips. Where is she? By herself at home, with a relative.

It did get a little repetitive, but the tenseness and creepy aspects really worked throughout and the movie did make me feel uneasy at times. It is becoming clear that horror movie directed by James Wan will be tense and really what horror should be. Creepy and disturbing without cutting people up or trying to hard.

","It is always fascinating to learn about supernatural events and to think about it. It can be tempting to fantasise that ghosts might be real.<br/><br/>So here we have a ghost story. A family in UK reports some supernatural incidents. It is all centered around Janet, who speaking with a gutural voice, etc. Everyone can interpret the story in his own way, but most likely two girls who needed attention faked a ghost story to get attention. There is no proof of levitation (must likely they jumped) and everybody who listened to death metal knows that it is possible to work on a gutural voice. So far the true story<br/><br/>What Hollywood made out of it was again a good vs evil story. There is the demon Valek who already before the incidents happened was connected to the Warrens (Ed painted a picture of Valek and Lorraine had visions of Eds death). So the couple investigates the case and first, we assume it is the ghost of Bill (who died in that house) who wants the family be gone. Later it turns out that the main evil being is of course Valek who is an evil demon. And we have all the classical stereotypes. Crosses that turn over, the crucifix as a main weapon against evil, etc. Until in the end Valek can be cast out as Lorraine knew his name.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the storyline was dull. The 6 points are justified by the suspense and the characters. I really found scenes scary and surprising."

","After over 3 decades of watching horrors, I know better than to watch trailers or expect something Oscar-worthy. 3 hours ago, I went into The Conjuring 2, expecting nothing but standard horror fare, and hoping that the movie would not be as ridiculously awful as Insidious III, which was laughable at best. And although it did have a few strong points, I felt that I just had to share my experience with those who have not seen it yet. <br/><br/>First of all, as hinted in the title, I've been laughing like crazy for nearly 2 hours straight now. You see, if you want your horror film to impress and scare the viewer, there are a few mistakes you simply must not make. It does not help, however, when the 'demon' appears in the form of a nun that bears a striking resemblance to Marilyn Manson on a bad make-up day! I was willing to look past that, despite the laughing fits every time the nun was shown, but then came the 'crooked man', who, in addition to being very badly made and looking completely fake, looked rather similar to Jim Carrey in 'The Mask'! So there was no need for any comic relief, as there already were plenty of opportunities to laugh, yet such relief was still deemed necessary. Not to mention a pointless scene with Patrick Wilson imitating Elvis and singing, probably intended to be funny and / or moving, and an awkwardly scripted negotiation sequence between Wilson and the demon...<br/><br/>Another issue is the fact that The Conjuring 2 'lifts' a lot from other, mostly better movies. I mean, what's the deal with the 'tent' inside the house? How many movies have used this idea since The Others? Boring and utterly cliché. Then there are the toy scenes, stolen straight from Poltergeist (pick your part), the possession sequences 'inspired' by The Exorcist, and numerous other 'inspirations'. That was the very first thing I noticed and that bothered me.<br/><br/>Of course, it is never helpful when a horror relies too much on computer generated effects and bland repetitive jump scares. This is always a negative, and most modern horrors look silly as a result.<br/><br/>Are there some positives? Sure. The camera work is skillful enough, and colors are used efficiently to create the right mood and atmosphere. But that's just about it.<br/><br/>On the whole, I am certain that I will never want to see this movie again. There are simply too many better ones out there, especially the cult classics. If, on the other hand, you are willing to look past the major flaws that The Conjuring 2 suffers from, then it might be worth watching, especially if you're a fan of Jim Carrey or Marilyn Manson!"

","Some spoilers. I won't go into the synopsis as you can read that elsewhere. I loved the first one and although this one isn't bad some choices in story and directing spoil what could have been a solid sequel. First off choosing this case to base a film must have seemed good on paper and the attention to detail for the time period is top notch, however a small terrace house in England just feels a little insignificant and low budget compared to the First, this is enhanced by linking it to Amityville. Not that they should have done Amityville as we have seen that done so many times before but to relate it too possibly the most infamous haunting ever then flash to a two up two down council house feels odd. What more having same daemon responsible for both makes no sense. The film has a good atmosphere with a sense of dread throughout but again where the old man and the nun daemon.are genuinely creepy they go and spoil it with the crooked man character, a creature so silly and out of place in the film more suited to Pan's labyrinth or the Muppets than this movie not to mention the dubious CGI. A little subtlety would have been better, even using a deformed version of the old man ghost would have been effective and made sense within the context of the film. The acting, script and directing are otherwise solid apart from a few unnecessary odd camera sweeps which makes it a shame that these few errors in judgement detract from which could be a worthy successor to the first film."

","WOW, Jameswan plotted this remarkable story according to his plan.what an outstanding sound effects along with horrifying scenes. While talking about story line, story was superb and fascinated. Ed and Lorraine made this film outstanding and Demon Nun was one of the most elagantly horrified character i have ever had watch. soundtracks were great which were according to their time. I must say This is the most scariest movie which was brought in after conjuring.James Wans trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that."
"mikovanara","7","0","0","3 September 2016"," Good for a scare
","This movie was more scary than I thought and I was sleeping with my lamp on after watching this movie. But, I did have a few issues with it though. The first issue I had was the cartoonish CGI ""crooked man"". I don't even understand the point of him. When I saw him the first and second time I laughed because it looked like cheap CGI and basically like a cartoon. Not scary. The second issue was the fact that the Demon had the child fake a scene in order to get them to leave.. But the entire plan of the demon was to kill Ed.. so why try to get them to leave in the first place? My third issue was that based on the original true case, there was no demon controlling the ghost. The demon was entirely made up. Also Ed and Lorraine Warren only spent a day there in real life and really had nothing to do with the investigation.<br/><br/>I already concluded while watching the movie that many things were exaggerated or made up for flair, like the Demon throwing Lorraine up against the wall towards the end and the crooked man and all. But I guess it makes for a good scary movie if you don't take into account the actual real events."
"Levelledbyaugusteofwind","10","0","0","2 September 2016"," Yes it's been done before......and yes it's still very scary.
","There are many reviews on here that try to tell us that we don't need these formulaic things, and that we have grown tired of the same old nonsense. That we crave something different. I'm here to say that those reviews should speak for themselves. I for one am a cinema goer and film watcher. When I go to see a particular type of film it's because I want to feel a certain way, whether that's excited, moved, horny or scared. Experience therefore tells me what to expect, but and here is the big but......it doesn't tell me how I'll receive it or when to receive it. In other words, I may well have seen it all before, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. After first watching The Conjuring, I loved it so much I watched two more times within a year. It was good old classic scare without the gore. I hoped they would make a 2nd one and was excited when it came round. The Conjuring 2 is more of the first but told in a different way, with different scares and different oh-dear-I-nearly-crapped-me-pants moments!! It's good old classic scares without the gore that peppers so many of what passes for today's horrors. It takes the same formulas that made the first one so good and adds a few more in for good measure. Its length allows the story to be told first from the the children's perspective and then adds in the main characters. For those that haven't seen the first one, we are given a brief synopsis of what they do and how they do it. Rather like the opening set piece of an action hero at the beginning of an action film. We are then taken on what I consider to be an emotional ride through the ordeal of the young girl. I felt for her, I really did. I felt for the mother who not only had to watch her children helplessly be tormented by the goings on the house, but also had her own worries of trying to keep her home and deal with the schools allegations of one of her children....all as a single mum. I felt for each if the girls siblings as they tried to do what they could to protect their sister from something they could not possibly explain. Then of course there's the two main characters battling their own demons as well as trying to save a family from theirs. The tension is built up through the bonds the viewer has formed for the main characters so that when the scares happen you feel like you're in the room with them. There's no obvious CGI, the sun isn't always shining and there are no obvious dispensable characters. It's a simple horror film that scared me witless.....more of the same please!!"
"CinemaClown","Null","0","0","1 September 2016"," A Rare Sequel That Improves Upon The Original
","Adopting the same blueprint that made The Conjuring a pop culture phenomenon, the second chapter in the Ed & Lorraine Warren saga builds upon the solid groundwork paved by the first film to deliver an even darker, scarier & better chiller that smartly expands the world some more, further deepens the primary characters' relationship, and features some genuinely chilling moments of old-school horror. A rare horror sequel that improves upon the original."
"gtylerpayne","9","0","0","1 September 2016"," Simple supernatural horror in the hands of a skilled director
","This is what it looks like when you take a decent script and put it in the hands of a highly skilled and experienced director in the prime of his career.<br/><br/>James Wan directed the first Saw movie, as well as The Conjuring, and the Insiduous movies. He also directed Furious 7 and is currently working on Aquaman. It almost seems like he is showing off in this movie. It seems like he is having fun and pulling all his tricks out with confidence and ease to make a movie that is just plain awesome.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that could have been terrible with the wrong director. The script really isn't anything all that special. It works, but there is nothing terribly new and original here, and the resolution to this movie is so bad it made me laugh out loud. (**Spolier**) This big powerful demon is terrorizing this family throughout the movie, and Lorraine is able to destroy it by ""saying his name."" And guess what? The demon told her what his name is... oops! I guess the demon didn't think that one through very well. To be scared of this demon for over an hour and then see the whole problem solved because she simply says his name, after he told her what it is, was kind of a let down for me. But then again, we're talking about demons here, so it's all kind of silly to begin with, and there really isn't any solution that would make much logical sense.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't really watch a movie like this for the plot, I watch it for the horror, and this movie has lots of it. They used a clever plot device that the demon is ""hiding"" by acting through other spirits. This gives the director a chance to use a wider variety of techniques and keeps things interesting. It's clear that James Wan really knows what he is doing and he plays with everything from CGI, to stop-motion, to jump-scares, and creepy sound effects. He has a lot of tricks in his bag and it makes for a movie with some great scenes.<br/><br/>He is especially good and using cinematography and color grading to darken areas of the frame just enough that you can't quite make out what you're looking at. I can't think of many other directors who do this as often and as well, but it really works.<br/><br/>Another scene I really love is the one with Lorainne by herself where the painting comes to life. Scenes like that are so cool, so well directed, and so scary, that they are instant classics in my opinion. If I were teaching a class on the greatest scenes in horror films, there are a few in this movie that would make the list.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are no strangers to horror films. Besides being in both Conjuring movies and the Insiduous movies, Vera was also played the mom in Orphan, another great horror film. I think they were well cast and do a good job playing Ed and Lorraine. This movie relies heavily on child actors, which can be tough, but they all do a great job. The main girl who plays Janet is really the main character in this film, and she does an admirable job. I found it somewhat unconvincing at times when she was doing the different demon voices, but I don't think that is her fault.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of horror, you will love this movie. Don't go in expecting a great story, but you can expect to see a really scary movie with a director who has become a master of his craft and is really given an opportunity here to do what he does best."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","0","1 September 2016"," Decent, but mostly forgettable
","I thought this was decent enough. It pretty much follows the same formula as the first film, but honestly, this did not need to be over two hours long. They overdo the set-up in the first hour. There's so much repetitiveness in its jump scares and horror scenes. By the time the second hour does come along, it also overdoes it to an even larger extent. A lot of scenes kept making me roll my eyes. It also seems that despite wanting to make Patrick Wilson's character more important, it managed to restrict Vera Farmiga's character. Despite following much of the formula of the original film, this still felt really cluttered and messy. It spins its wheels a lot. Despite the many criticisms I have of it, it did manage to entertain me. I don't think the original film is entirely greatness by any means, but it was still better than this."
"braddles-21974","7","0","0","31 August 2016"," Much flashier than the first *very minor spoilers*
","Let me start by saying that the conjuring 2 is a very entertaining movie that is well worth a watch. However it doesn't have that ""instant horror classic"" feel that the first one did. One of the main differences in this movie was that there was much more effort put into special effects and trying too hard to make the evil characters creepy. At times it felt a bit like I was watching the first insidious movie, with the bad guys caked in makeup and always making quick jerking motions. The second conjuring movie also doesn't have that same sense of dread and realism that the first one has. Rather it feels as though I am just watching a well made horror movie. This takes away from the actual lingering fear that there was so much of in the first movie. It seems as though to try to combat this, more jump scares were added which I'm not a huge fan of, (even though some of the jump scares in this were top notch and even managed to catch me off guard). The build up in the first conjuring was phenomenal as the movie starts off completely normal and you feel as nothing can wrong. This movie however starts right off the bat by showing you evil entities, which takes away from the buildup and prepares you for what's to come. It feels like a very cheap start that is just paying homage to the first movie and flaunting the fact that Ed and Loraine deal with ""big bad evil spirits"". So to summarize, it didn't give that same sense of sheer horror that the first one managed to, but Its still an unsettling film that has high entertainment value."

"thesar-2","8","0","0","30 August 2016"," Superior Superstition
","Wow. I cannot believe I am saying this, but this ""ghost"" story is one of my favorite horror movies in the past several years.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of ghost stories/haunted house tales. Maybe it's a Catholic thing. No offense to the followers or religion itself, but perhaps the reasons why Priests and the Catholic Church are brought up in so many haunted flicks, these kinds of ""true stories"" hit closer to home to that faith. Maybe, that's why so many followers are scared of these possession flicks.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't believe in the roaming spirits, so I am not frightened by any of these types of movies, including this one. But, I do believe in trying to broaden my horizons. So, a few years ago, I gave the infamous ghost trilogy a shot. These included the most popular haunted movies: The Conjuring, Sinister and Insidious. Truthfully, I wasn't a fan, myself, of any of the three, and most of them blended in so much I couldn't tell you which was which.<br/><br/>That said, I do recall I cared a tad bit more for the Ethan Hawke one. I believe that one was named Sinister. That one I did like, but only a bit more than the other two. <br/><br/>Since, again, I'm not on board with these supposedly ""true"" event films, I ended my open-mindedness with the originals. I wasn't about to waste my time with the sequels or spin-offs when I knew I would never fully enjoy them.<br/><br/>This ended now. I was convinced by a friend and enormously high ratings for The Conjuring 2 to finally sit down and watch it. By far, it surpassed its original tenfold and the other two tremendously. In fact, I can safely say, this, 1408 and original Blair Witch Project are my favorite intentionally scary ghost movies.<br/><br/>The Demonbusters of the 70s are back to co-investigate an English Estate that may/may not be possessed and if spooky, the Catholic Church might step in to help. But, they might be too late by then.<br/><br/>Boy, did I summarize this movie with zero spoilers. I am proud of myself! But, it was easy. This movie is pretty straight-forward in regards to synopsis. The real meat of the experience was the acting, the heart and depth of the characters. That was one major positive.<br/><br/>The other for me was the fact that what started off as yet another clichéd, by the book haunted house movie quickly turned into a real movie, an original take and ghosts that freaking did stuff. Most of it blew me away and I liked the ghosts out of the shadows. Finally! It wasn't a movie so reliant on showing barely any movement until the end.<br/><br/>Sure, they say ""less is more"" in horror, but damnit, that's so overdone by now. I really want to see something. I want the other characters to see the same thing, as well. And this movie delivered in spades after about 20 minutes or so. <br/><br/>The action, if you can call it that in this kind of film, was well thought-out and inventive. The characters, namely our favorite Demonbusters, made us really care about them. And the ending was exactly how I wanted it to play out. (Selfish, but that's what I like to see and not the same ole finale most horror filmmakers think is still original and wanted.)<br/><br/>Not only would I recommend this movie, I would just say skip that Ghost- Trilogy I spoke about and just watch this. Again, I can't speak for the almost countless sequels and spin-offs, but I can say this beats any ""original"" any day of the week.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Chris. You owe me a new phone. No. You know exactly what I am talking about. Pay up."
"ihyousf","1","3","8","30 September 2016"," Boring as hell, IMDb voting is rigged.
","I don't watch as many movies anymore as I used to. As I am approaching 36, i have been watching movies for about 25 years now. I kind of seen it all, and I don't want to waste my time on general, boring movies anymore. Therefore, I only select movies that score higher than a 7+ In my segment (male, 30+) and an interesting trailer.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 matched both these criteria, but I really don't see how. This movie is incredibly boring, predictable and uninteresting. There is really nothing new or interesting here that you haven't seen before elsewhere. Especially the first part is so boring and repetitive. Child sits alone in chamber. Child sees / hears something unusual. Child runs to mummy. Mummy sees nothing. Skip to next scene. Rinse, repeat for about four times before we move along. Then the Americans come in. Now the action gets more various, but mostly it's so fake and bad cgi, you cant really take it seriously.<br/><br/>So i don't know. I don't see how this movie could score so high here on IMDb. I guess film makers are hiring click farms in low cost countries more and more to pump up the scores, causing the IMDb scores to become rigged. Very annoying. I'll give this movie a 1 to counter balance those fake scores. Its not really that bad, but not that great either. A 5,0 would be a realistic score imo.<br/><br/>If you want to see some good, interesting, horror, scary movies / series, watch The exorcist, the exorcism of Emily rose, the x-files, supernatural, poltergeist, the grudge 1, paranormal activity 1, or the Blairwitch Project. You'll be way more entertained than with this crap."
"Rawal_Afzal","10","3","8","24 June 2016"," Scary as hell!
","The film might have had faults, and it did, but I have a habit of going light on films that fulfill its purpose. The purpose of this one was to scare the hell out of you, and by God it deserves hundred percent marks for doing that so well. Not a minute goes by without killing suspense. The best of the lot was the knocking on the door, which I am sure they must have done using a hammer or something. It was terrifying, every little scene.<br/><br/>What was so unique about this horror flick was, and I have only watched a handful of those in my entire life, that the ghost in this one did his tricks when when other people were present. It usually goes like this in films that they make a target and then that target goes through all the haunting, he/she isn't trusted by anyone because the ghost goes completely missing when others are present. Here was a ghost with a clear thought process and a brave one too. Secondly, the usual script is that it takes off lightly and keeps getting stronger, but each scene in this film has been given equal and as much attention as for example an ending scene would. It was balanced out intelligently. So it was a lot different from many of the mainstream horror films. The film- makers deserve a huge amount of credit for making it feel so real. There might have been many other horror flicks that caused me nightmares in childhood and made me many sleepless nights, but as a grown-up into mid-20s, I can definitely attest that I haven't seen a film like this. Terrifying!<br/><br/>A bit sad that I only got time to watch this one nine days into its release over here in Germany. There were hardly eight people present in the theatre, two girls who screamed occasionally and were very noisy, but couldn't quite have the added fun that I did whilst watching 'Annabelle' (2014), which was a full house and very noisy (the noise is only good for a film of this genre mind you, not many others).<br/><br/>I was most curious about the whole story this film was based upon and did some reading into it. Interesting stuff. Whilst not necessarily needing to come to believe in ghosts and demons, I still respect what the family might have gone through back then. As someone who has been through a lot of medical conditions, some of which may sound outrageous to others, I have learnt that we should respect others' experiences and suffering. I'll just leave at that, without the need to get into whether the family played a prank, whether it could be a mental condition of the girl that might have led the family into believing that something else is going on, or even, again, there were demons indeed. You never know when the day might arrive that you suffer from something and no one believes you, therefore, I will just respect their experience.<br/><br/>Watching this film has reminded me of a couple of fears that I had in my childhood for example. One which stayed with me till we moved to Germany was, that whilst being asleep a dog would come and bite off my feet. This had history. Back in our village we used to sleep outside the rooms in summer, and a dog from our neighbourhood was notorious for having previously bitten people. As it happened, it climbed the wall and landed in our house, by a whisking passing by by uncovered feet. That frightening moment stayed on for months and months. The other being, watching a horror drama on some Pakistan TV channel. Actor Nabeel, who now works in the comedy TV serial 'Bulbulay' on ARY Digital, worked in it and would haunt his mother at night who masterminded his death in an accident. He would walk from one wall of the house to the other at nights, muttering ""Aeyh zaalim maa'n (O' cruel mother)!"" That was horrible for me! For months afterwards I regretted watching it, and only I know how much I went through and how much time I took to come out of them.<br/><br/>Lastly, I must add something outrageous here. Now, had I seen any pictures or videos of the film, or even had slight knowledge of this, I wouldn't have watched the film, or at least not taken my brother with myself. Coming straight to the point, the house in it, its shape, form and appearance from outside 10 out of 10 matches to the building in which my brother has an apartment. I was left speechless at the very first sight of the house from outside and from then on we both watched the film with as much personal touch as not many would possibly have."
"ghost_dog86","4","3","8","12 June 2016"," ""The Conjuring 2"" review
","James Wan is back to direct a second tale depicting paranormal researchers/ghost hunters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren. But is it as scary as ""The Conjuring""? Synopsis: In the 1970's Ed and Lorraine travel to England to investigate a haunting which locals refer to as London's Amityville. <br/><br/>The Good: For the first hour, ""The Conjuring 2"" does almost everything right. Even though director James Wan essentially uses the same horror buildup's, which lead to the same jump-scares and thus the same cranked up to 11 horror musical cues, that he always does; he does it all so well many may argue that Wan has created his own official horror style; a style which holds the highest rate of effectiveness in the genre. It's as though with every movie he's teaching a master-class in cookie-cutter horror direction, but does it better and more effectively than anyone working today. <br/><br/>The Bad: Little by little, there emerges this love story aspect between Ed and Lorraine. This love story is pushed along by some of the worst dialogue I've heard outside of a Harlequin romance. As this aspect moves to the forefront of the story, it becomes more cringe-inducing, reaching the point where every time Ed and Lorraine pause, turn and tell each other something unbearably lovey dovey, I couldn't help but imagine that the latter half of ""The Conjuring 2"" would essentially be the movie Nicholas Sparks would make if he tried his hand at the horror film genre. <br/><br/>Along with said love story, there also emerged another questionable aspect which stops this film dead in its tracks time and time again. ""The Conjuring 2"" becomes a religious film; or at least contains a very religious undertone. I understand that movies dealing with hauntings and exorcisms go hand in hand with priest and bible verses, but this is different. I would almost liken the religious undertones this film takes on to movies like ""Do You Believe?"", ""Fireproof"" or ""Courageous""; films which seem like dramatic genre pieces, but end up morphing into Sunday School lessons. This aspect isn't a bad thing, on face value. But much like the love story aspect, wholesome religious rhetoric seems way out of place in a film of this nature. <br/><br/>That said, there will be many who will be able to look past the sappiness and the Sunday School level preaching. But even if that's the case, screenwriter Carey Hayes has one more surprise in store for those who reach the 2 hour mark; an ending which in its own right is idiotically simplistic, but whose explanation is so convoluted that as it begins, I looked down at the time and recoiled in horror at how long I'd been sitting there. <br/><br/>Final Thought: Do you remember ""Insidious: Chapter 2""? I don't and (looking back on my article) I gave it a positive review. That's what ""The Conjuring 2"" is. Even if you enjoy this overlong British version of its predecessor (just with more religious asides and a painfully sappy Hallmark inspired love story crowbarred in) at the end of the day it'll still be a forgettable film."

"jtindahouse","6","5","18","9 June 2016"," Can't live up to the powerful original
","Usually when you go to see a horror sequel it's the villain/monster that you're being treated to another viewing of. 'The Conjuring 2' is a rare exception where it is the protagonists who are the constant. Sadly, this equals less guarantee of quality, because it's unlikely that they are what made the first one great. 'The Conjuring' was a brilliant horror film. The intensity, story and thrills were all of the highest quality and the result was one of the finest horror films ever made. So the sequel had a lot to live up to. Could it do it? Not quite.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice is an extended run time. 133 minutes is long for a horror movie. A lot of time is spent setting the mood, with a very patient build up taking place. For me this could have been cut back a bit, as it was a little slow at times and one or two scenes felt unnecessary. James Wan is a fantastic director who usually paces a film exquisitely, so I suspect this had more do with the script than anything else.<br/><br/>The main thing it lacks that the original achieved so well though, is a genuine concern for the characters in the film. The spooky, middle of nowhere, atmosphere created in the original is nowhere to found here, and that takes away a lot of intensity from the film. The characters of 'Ed' and 'Lorraine' also feel too in charge this time around, and are portrayed more as heroes than regular people. This also goes a long way to destroying the level of discomfort the audience should be experiencing. <br/><br/>There are some good frights here and there and some genuinely creepy visuals, but it all feels short of the high expectations the original created. And that sums it up in a lot of ways, it's not a bad film, it just can't live up to what we had all hoped for."

""Is that so?"" says genius director-screenwriter James Wan, ""challenge accepted!""<br/><br/>At first, I must say I was slightly disappointed having realized that The Conjuring 2 isn't a straight sequel, and doesn't pick up after the events of the first film (as I was looking forward to getting some long overdue answers and closure). The sequel, in short, as another crazy Ed & Lorraine Warren adventure, beginning with a fine and well deserving tribute to the famous Amityville incident. Her premonitions still haunting her, Lorraine hopes to convince Ed to stop their work as Possession/Haunting 911, but the two find themselves unable to send away a family in need, who is haunted and terrorized by yet another malevolent entity of the underworld. Nothing new so far - but only because I'm refraining from spoilers. Towards the final third of the film, Wan presents one of the best, most off-guard catching twists since Insidious.<br/><br/>As in the first film and the less impressive spin-off ""Annabelle"", the story is divided into the main plot (Ed & Lorraine to the rescue vs. haunting spirit), and a side-plot portraying an entity haunting the couple itself. Both come to a closure in a suspenseful, creative and innovative manner as only Wan has been able to produce in the past decade. The story is compelling, interesting and well presented, and the conclusion is absolutely marvelous!<br/><br/>As in the previous film, Patrick Wilson is extraordinary and Vera Farmiga is only slightly less impressive. Patrick McAuley deserves as many complements for such fine acting skill at such a young age. However, the show is breathtakingly stolen by Madison Wolfe as little Janet, the spirit's main point of interest. In the first film I thought I'd seen the pinnacle of ""possessed""-acting, but just as Wan was able to higher the stakes of writing and direction - Wolfe presented a whole new level of exquisite acting.<br/><br/>In addition, The Conjuring presented one of the scariest Horror icons ever seen on screen (being Annabelle, the nightmare-inducing doll). I really hadn't expected Wan to be able to top that. Surprise surprise, he did. The painting and appearance of the ""nun-demon"" in this film is one of the most terrifying images I've ever seen, very much resembling the haunting spirit in Insidious, yet not enough to qualify as recycling.<br/><br/>As for the other info some might find interesting - the music and soundtrack are as ""Wan"" as can be, combining haunting thrilling tunes with nursery rhymes, with the addition of a religious song. Hey, if it worked so greatly in Insidious, why change it? The cinematography is nothing special, but this goes unnoticed during the films. In addition, just like in the first film, cliché jump- scares are almost non-existent, and the very few that do appear are in very good taste.<br/><br/>In summary, the creator of Saw and Insidious has done it again, placing The Conjuring franchise right at the top with the best of them. I never have high expectations of sequels, but I tell you, Wan is going to make a believer out of me yet. I had to think a lot about the rating I was going to give this film, but the final plot twist (which is of a whole new level and never seen before) made it an easier decision. If you are in any way a fan of Horror - go watch the first film, and then this one. You'll be happy (and terrified) that you did."
"ravenhair702","10","2","5","28 August 2016"," Fantastic sequel!
","I just watched The Conjuring 2 last night and I was clinging onto my wife more than she was to me! I loved this film! It's rare that a sequel is better than the first, but this movie proves that it does happen. Looking at the total production cost of this movie and what it's made to date...it's staggering. 40 Million to make and 40 million on it's opening weekend! Most movies these days don't make that in six months! The acting is top notch...even for the kids in this movie! You can feel their fear and utter desperation in their situation as they try to cope and get through it. The demonic spirit that plagues them throughout the movie will make you reconsider using a nightlight when you go to bed after you watch this movie. All in all, a great movie. I normally don't watch horror movies twice...but I'm buying this one when it comes out for sale!"
"santosheflu","6","2","5","23 July 2016"," One time good watch but no horror
","The promise shown in the first part encouraged me to watch this. The movie has a decent plot and the atmospheric setting is excellent. However, the bleakness could not be adequately sustained till the end. It becomes a happy movie, not a spine-chilling one. The director I thought lost an opportunity presented to him by the story writer. He was not much helped by the screen play. I think they can learn a thing or two from The Witch. Having said this, I must agree that the actors have done well and help the movie. A few scenes are worth remembering. But one time good watch and low horror quotient! This is no The Shining!"
"mattiasflgrtll6","10","2","5","16 June 2016"," Holy shi't, James Wan!
","Are you trying to give me a heart attack?<br/><br/>You want to talk scary? THIS is scary. 2013, Wan came out with another horror movie, called The Conjuring. It didn't take long before it got hailed as one of the best new horror movies. And I couldn't help but agree. I hadn't found a movie so scary in a long time.<br/><br/>Then I today went to the theaters to see the sequel. I was hopeful, despite the common once-is-enough rule when it comes to horror movies. But I gotta say, this movie was fantastic. I loved it even more than the first one! First off, if there's anything Wan knows how to do, it's an opening scene. If you're not invested from the start, it's a little harder to get into a movie meant to be frightening. But he succeeds with exactly that, and I feel exhausted before the title scroll even has shown up. The story when you think about it, is pretty similar to the first, but with the big difference that not only the family with the haunted house in the danger. Ed and Lorraine themselves are too! And I have to give credit for how their characters were developed in this movie. The movie delves very deep into the personalities of them, with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga doing an extraordinary job making them likable. They are well-written not only as two people really passionate about their unusual profession, but as a loving and caring couple as well. The scenes where they show their affection for each other are superb.<br/><br/>But of course, I'm mainly here to talk about whether or not it was effective as a horror movie. And it sure as hell was. Jumpscares or not, when you think about it... Doesn't Crooked Man just scare the s'hit out of you? And doesn't it feel disturbingly surreal when a girl suddenly gets the palest face and starts smiling evilly, all while speaking with a rusty old man's voice? And doesn't it make you uneasy when something simply supposed to be a painting comes to life?<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is more than just the half-creepy/half-amusing horror movie you watch and then forget about. It's an experience. One that makes you speechless with wonder.<br/><br/>9.5, the rating is only knocked down by a few cheesy moments and (very intermittent) parts of off pacing. I recommend it to anyone desperate for a revival in the genre. Because real horror... is finally back."
"stevendbeard","7","2","5","12 June 2016"," Good Scares/Good Sequel
","I saw ""The Conjuring 2"", starring Patrick Wilson-Fargo_tv, Watchmen; Vera Farmiga-Bates Motel_tv, The Departed; Frances O'Connor-Windtalkers, Bedazzled and Madison Wolfe-Keanu, Home Sweet Hell.<br/><br/>This is a sequel to the 2013 movie that tells the real life stories of Ed & Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators-portrayed by Patrick & Vera. They make a great team, with Vera having psychic visions and Patrick handling all the heavy lifting. James Wan is once again the director-besides the 2013 original Conjuring, he also directed Furious 7, Insidious & Saw. This story takes place in 1977, just as Patrick & Vera have finished checking out the unwanted horrors in Amityville-Yep, THAT Amityville-and are about ready for a well deserved rest. The first movie takes place before the Amityville investigation and this one is after it. The Church has another case lined up for them in England. It seems that a single mother of 4 children, Frances, is having problems with some sort of demonic possession of one of her daughters, Madison. When Patrick & Vera arrive, they are met with lots of skepticism, both from the regular public and professional scholars. FYI: Even in our present time, there are people that believe it was all just a hoax. There are lots of good, scary moments and as the end credits start, you get to see photos of the real participants and also hear an actual recording of an interview between the Warrens and the possessed little girl-played in the movie by Madison. It's rated ""R"" for terror and horror violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. I enjoyed it as much as the first one and would buy it on DVD."
"samgiannn","8","2","5","12 June 2016"," The Conjuring 2 (2016)
","Three years after he blew the doors off cinemas across the country with one of the biggest modern horror movies, The Conjuring, James Wan comes back with a true sequel to The Conjuring, aptly titled The Conjuring 2. Often, horror sequels try to get too big or too flashy and end up being far inferior to their predecessors. The Conjuring 2 is certainly bigger and flashier, but James Wan has some gift for taking a generic storyline and making it scary as hell. The Conjuring 2 takes place six years after the original film in Enfield, London. It's based on the Enfield Haunting, one of the most well-documented paranormal cases of all time and was labeled ""England's Amityville."" In this haunting the Hodgson family, a single mother and her four children, are being tormented by a spirit and call on several paranormal investigators to help them, including Ed and Lorraine Warren. The case quickly turns into a media circus with allegations that the haunting may be a hoax, and the Warrens have to decide if the kids are playing an elaborate prank or if the Hodgsons are living in a very real nightmare. Being a horror sequel, or really just a movie sequel in general, it's expected that this movie is going to up the stakes and flashy imagery compared to the original film. The Conjuring 2 is no different. There really isn't a scene that's as brilliant as the hide-and-clap game with Lili Taylor from the first Conjuring. However, at a staggering 134 minutes, James Wan packs in a ton of surprisingly durable scares. After a great opening sequence, Wan gives us about 5 minutes to get acquainted with the Hodgsons before already scaring us silly with the first night at the Enfield house. There's tons of agonizingly long tracking shots that ratchet up the tension for an incredibly long time. What's great is that not all of these shots end with a jump scare. Be warned though because if there is a jump scare, it's perfect. There's not a single cheap jump in this movie. The ""scare scenes"" themselves are very long; once one of those great tracking shots is done, you'll go to another person for an equally scary scene. Because there's so much suspense and so many scares in the movie, the 134 minute running time never feels too long. It feels just right, although the scares might be exhausting by the end of the movie. Wan also has a knack for making an old scare new again. He can somehow make a tired jump scare scary again, but at the same time, it's not quite as fresh as it was the first time. That's what holds back The Conjuring 2 from surpassing the original film. The Conjuring 2 does have some heart though. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great as the married ghostbusters, and the Hodgson family is a likable group of people to hang out with for two and half hours. Madison Wolfe steals the show as Janet, who gets put through the wringer throughout the whole movie. Even if it doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor, The Conjuring 2 is an incredibly scary thrill ride that'll be hard to top this summer. I do have to admit that I did scream very loudly once."
"ShazaliSharaini","9","2","5","9 June 2016"," Great Scary Flick!
","The first Insidious was good, but the sequel was screechy and very B. Not this one. IMHO, Conjuring 2 is scarier than the original.<br/><br/>I wish they'd remake Amityville because I can't remember watching Amytyville Horror this scary.<br/><br/>Remember those movies which had those scary bits, that made you cower under a pillow but turned out being just a dream sequence? Well, none of those here. SPOILER ALERT!!! That Transformers scene at the Hodgson's neighbour's house!! I was telling my wife: ""Naaah, It's just a dream"" but it isn't! Wait, there are two dream sequences, but they are more like visions than insignificant fake scares.<br/><br/>This is a winner! Get yourself scared $#!+less. Oh, it's 2 hours' long. But, you won't feel it.<br/><br/>Enjoy The Conjuring 2 as I have."
"sharmila-g-rao","3","4","15","12 June 2016"," Extremely disappointing
","What I did not like:<br/><br/>Starts with the same plot, big family, no money (can accept this as they say it is based on a true story). Too many nights that show scary Janet teleporting, and it gets boring. Again Ed and Lorraine not wanting to want to take cases, but they want to help a family. The crooked man mechanical toy is boring and is nothing like the one used in Conjuring. And, it is silly that the Nun demon tells Loraine her name, and the name power is already old and is used in many movies.<br/><br/>All in all, skip this movie, wait for the DVD if you really want to watch it. People who have not watched Conjuring might like this movie.<br/><br/>Why I did not like:<br/><br/>1. Conjuring set the bar too high, I can still go back and enjoy the cupboard scene, someone behind the door scene, the game the ghost plays with the mother, and the final exorcism was brilliant. There was a story, a logic. This has nothing. Once out of the theater, everything can be easily forgotten.<br/><br/>2. Too much hype created for the movie and most of the good scenes are already in the trailer. <br/><br/>Why 3 stars?<br/><br/>1. 2 scares (Old man near the TV and the bed sheet getting thrown off Janet did make me jump).<br/><br/>2. Using the old man as a pawn was a good twist.<br/><br/>3. This time, the ghost does everything is front of everyone. Thank god for that!"

","We loved it! Rarely is a sequel better than the original and The Conjuring 2 definitely delivers. We were on the edge of our seats for most of the film. I liked that the film wasn't one sided. It gave room for skepticism. The Warrens weren't there to convince anyone of the paranormal but to help the family. <br/><br/>This is definitely the first horror film I ever cried at, not from fear (though there was plenty of that), but from the undeniable love between the Warrens. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have great chemistry.<br/><br/>Another first was after that breathe-taking climax of an ending the audience in my theater gave a round of applause. I've never seen that happen during a horror film.<br/><br/>I can see The Conjuring franchise continuing for years to come when they're this well directed, produced and acted.

Editing is amazing, acting is at its finest and story-line is genuine. There is no dull moment in the whole movie and the scares and jumps are not cheesy and predictable. Some of them you would expect from a ghost movie, but this tops it. Some elements can be found in other movies, but the way this was edited makes a difference.

","Decided to re-watch both 'The Conjuring' films, with memories of really liking both, after watching, and not liking all that much, 'The Nun' (which was watched as part of my watching as many films of 2018 as possible quest) very recently. Just to see whether they held up, as good as remembered and whether they succeeded where 'The Nun' didn't and didn't make that film's mistakes. <br/><br/>On re-watch, 'The Conjuring 2', like its very good predecessor, does hold up very well and actually just as good as remembered. It succeeds splendidly in where 'The Nun' failed and has none of its mistakes. 'The Conjuring 2', like its predecessor, is not a perfect film, but it is very atmospheric, well made and genuinely scary, or at least to me it was. It is a very familiar premise, done to death actually, but the atmosphere stops it from being too predictable and there is enough freshness. As a sequel, it fares very well and one of not many to actually be on the same level as its predecessor.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring 2' is overlong, which is its biggest issue. This would have been rectified by 20 minutes being trimmed and the pace of the first act, with a beginning that doesn't attention-grab or unsettle as it should have done, tightened up.<br/><br/>Other than those, 'The Conjuring 2' is very good. It looks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The music is haunting and not over-bearing, recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere (which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regard).<br/><br/>Script is not too awkward and is structured coherently, with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour. The direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material. The story takes time to unfold but doesn't get dull once it gets going, while the ending is leagues better, much more momentum and the resolution didn't feel rushed. As said too, 'The Conjuring 2' yet again is genuinely scary, with actual tension, suspense and dread, in a palm-sweating and heart-pounding sense at its best, while not relying too much on jump scares (they are there but have build up and were surprising).<br/><br/>Found myself liking the characters more than expected. The leads were ones worth caring for, didn't get frustrated with them, wish for more personality or annoyed by them. The antagonist was frightening, was neither over-used or under-utilised and didn't look cheap. The acting also comes off well, especially Vera Farmiga who is superb, Patrick Wilson is even better here, while also impressed with how Frances O'Connor coped with a role that on paper seemed limited. <br/><br/>Summarising, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

"ThomasDrufke","7","1","2","23 September 2018"," Valak's Awakening
","The thing I like about both Conjuring films is that as much as the films present us with terrifying demons and creatures, it's always been about the Warrens. Ed and Lorraine are the center of the stories even when the focus seems to be elsewhere. Conjuring 2 feels about 35 minutes too long, with a first act that significantly drags, but when it gets going, it sure gets going. This time around the Warrens head to Enfield, London to investigate claims of a poltergeist terrorizing a young girl, Janet, in her family's home. The first hour deals with the family going through it with their own team of London paranormal investigators before it finally reaches the Warrens. Meanwhile, the Warrens, and specifically Lorraine, had the Nun to deal with before heading over. The good thing about these films is that there isn't the cliched ""no one can see the demon but the person being possessed"". The Conjuring 2 comes right out and declares that this particular demon, Valak, isn't hiding his presence. Much like the first film, it comes down to the religious angle of it all, which I could give or take. But I do appreciate the attention to detail, the lack of cliches, and the gorgeous cinematography. While not being nearly as tightly directed as the first, James Wan still has something here and hopefully continues to for years to come.'<br/><br/>7.7/10"

","The mere mention of a movie getting a sequel is enough to make people reconsider their life choices. This was how I felt when I heard about ""The Conjuring 2"". It wasn't that I wasn't hopeful.

<ul><li>To be completely honest, I think this film was a bit scarier than the first. ""The Conjuring"" was a creepy and scary movie, but most of its best moments were shown in the marketing.

<ul><li>The original film managed to use minimal CGI, which may have been to its lower budget. ""The Conjuring 2"", however, used quite a bit of unrealistic CGI. There were some moments where the visuals were so bad that they almost completely took me out of the movie.</li><li>One scene gets on my nerves. There is a scene where the main family is being interviewed, and the youngest daughter starts talking like an old man. The older sister is right next to her, but she has a complete lack of expression on her face; she's acting as if her sister isn't being possessed by an old man. It seemed really dumb, and I don't know why the director kept this in the film.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, ""The Conjuring 2"" is an uncommonly strong sequel, and the third movie of an ever growing franchise.

","Supernatural sequel The Conjuring 2 is a fictionalised account of the Enfield Poltergeist, which allegedly terrorised the occupants of a council house in Enfield, England in 1977. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who, having decided to take a break from investigating ghosts and demons after the trauma of Amityville, agree to travel to England in a purely observational capacity. Of course, they become far more involved than they originally intended once they see the plight of the family involved, single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), and her four children, Janet (Madison Wolfe), Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley), all of whom have had enough of their unwanted ghostly house-guest.<br/><br/>At 134 minutes, The Conjuring 2 is about half an hour too long, and often feels like it is dragging its heels: there's only so many times that we need to see furniture being tossed around or the kids waking up to experience supernatural shenanigans. That said, the film is a serviceable sequel that should please fans of the original and those interested in the paranormal, partly because it is loosely based on fact (with the emphasis on 'loosely'), and partly because James Wan has had loads of practise when it comes to creepiness, the director conjuring up (pun intended) plenty of atmosphere and some well crafted scares. A solid cast also contribute to the film's effectiveness, with youngsters Wolfe and Esposito faring particularly well as the Hodgson sisters, who suffer the most from the haunted happenings.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, the film doesn't do anything to rewrite the rules of the genre, but it's a slight improvement over the original. I was entertained enough to want to see what further sequels and spin-offs might hold (the latest being the forthcoming The Nun, which is based on the demon that is causing all the trouble in this film)."

Well, OK. This is not a statement I have much faith in at the best of times and I have even less in the case of supernatural films, much as I might enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>There was a reasonably well documented ""Enfield Poltergeist"". This film fictionalises, augments, and treats the thing as a genuine supernatural manifestation. It should be noted that the movie, while using some real names, locations and alleged events, is otherwise entirely fictional.<br/><br/>Which doesn't mean it's not a good horror film, because it is. It has a stealthy growth of dread, and some genuinely scary moments of which only a couple are accompanied by abrupt blaring orchestral hits. The house interiors are grim (but Dad left, and Mum has no money, so that's OK), and the exteriors are battered by too much torrential rain (and rain which rather too obviously comes from overhead rain gantries, and is there really that much water in Enfield basements?), but the down-at-heel suburbia setting is effectively atmospheric nonetheless.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise the Warrens from The Conjuring, but this film belongs to Madison Wolfe, 13 when this was filmed.

This is not one of those so called scary movies that things jump out at you for that quick jump. No No in this movie you will see it coming. You will see it and it will scare the pants right off you. No cheap screams here. More like whimpering in the corner hoping for a nice ending. Will you get it? I guess you have to watch it to find out."

","The year is 1977 and paranormal investigators Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson)travel across the Atlantic to Enfield, London to help a single mother of four children Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor)who believes that there is a presence in her home. Things take a turn for the worst when one of Peggy's daughters Janet (Madison Wolfe) becomes the focus of the entity's attention....<br/><br/>In many ways this sequel was quite brave as I could see that James Wan could have potentially set himself up for a fall - this film is essentially an English version of The Amityville horror and I could imagine that some people may complain about it being a rip-off of The Amityville Horror(although in fairness to Wan he does make no pretences that the film is anything else given the fact that The Amityville Horror is referenced in the early stages of the film and like The Amityville Horror the events that happened in London are purportedly based on true events as well).<br/><br/>Despite the familiar central premise, The Conjuring 2 still has a lot of strong and nice touches about it. Like the first film, Wan builds up the suspense admirably and again moves the camera around well; the score is good and is also used well and at the appropriate times. Wan has also done an excellent job in recreating 1970's Britain which gives the film an appropriate sense of time and period.<br/><br/>Like the first film, this sequel has its fair share of creepy and shocking moments and many of these sequences are carried off with a degree of skill and professionalism. Unfortunately, there are odd 'scary' moments in the film that didn't work for me whereby they looked more silly than scary, but there were more moments where the scares worked so this isn't a major criticism.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good too with both Farmiga and Wilson being on good form. Frances O'Connor is also endearing as the struggling single parent. However, the real star of the show was young Madison Wolfe who stole the show from her adult co-stars.<br/><br/>Even though this is basically a reinterpretation of The Amityville Horror it still has enough of James Wan's style about it to make it an enjoyable experience. It does have much of the feel of the first film about it which does make some of what you see here a tad more predictable, but the chances are that if you liked the first film then you should still enjoy this one too."

","This film is just scary as hell. This one also focuses on the love between the two leads. The nun is creepy. I know creepy nuns have been done before, but this one uses it so well. I also found myself yelling at Patrick Wilson's character at the end of the film. Listen to your wife you fool! Silly I know but that is a testament to how invested I was in the story and its characters. I highly recommend this movie. Especially to those who loved the first movie."

","Usually sequels never live up to the original film, but this film stands out. I thought the Conjuring 2 was just as scary as the first movie and I'm so happy they made it. Although many will miss the setting of the farmhouse, the house in England is turned into a house of horrors that lives up to the original. Based off of the true story of the Enfield Haunting, a family is terrorized by a demon that's set on possessing the daughter. I'm so happy that Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson returned as the Warrens, their acting is breathtaking and I would love to see more of them in the future. I loved that they added the Amityville Haunting in the beginning of the film (which they also investigated in real life) and played off of the end of the first film. Another thing I really loved about the movie, is the other side characters shown in the film, like The Crooked Man and The Nun. They are already making a spin off about The Nun right now and I can't wait to see what it has in store for us. Bottom line is The Conjuring 2 will scare you just as much as the first one and it definitely should be in your Top 10 Scariest Films."
"fobisaxa","6","1","2","12 April 2017"," The conjuring : a Series
","James Wan continues the series that gripped America and made us sleep with the lights on, with an admirable follow up to the first Conjruing film. The first half of the movie had terrifying scenes that build tension and dread that really stick with the viewer. Wan uses camera angles that are incredibly effective that magnify the scares. While the movie was effectively scary, it did not match the flair of the first film. The first film, built the tension much more effectively, and the sense of dread was more prevalent. Again this film was creepy, it really was, it just didn't have those moments that stuck with me like the first film did, and that is the challenge with sequels overall in trying to outdo the first film. I will say the young actress who was targeted by the presence in the film was absolutely fantastic and stole the scenes. Again good movie, with good scares, just not on the level of the first film."

","I am not a regular reviewer that this is the first time I am writing a review so spare me if I hurt the feelings of anyone. I am just comparing the story of The Conjuring part 1 with the part 2. The part 1 had a more attractive story with father, mother and children's all were part. In part 2 we didn't had the father and smaller sons comes to picture just when he goes to the kitchen during a seen towards the end.<br/><br/>Also the use of heat sensitive cameras and other techniques used in part 1 were really making the scenes true and believable. Which was missing from some scenes in part 2.<br/><br/>But the horror, had played its part. I was wondering for some more scenes of the stutterer boy when he couldn't find words to express his fears. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is amazing and should be watched alone only."
"kannibalcorpsegrinder","8","1","2","4 April 2017"," Solid if overall rather decent haunting effort
","Attempting to move on in their careers, the famous couple is brought to a case in England involving a single mother who believes that her home is possessed only to find that it's targeted their teenage daughter and must try to stop the demonic entity from haunting them.<br/><br/>Overall this one wasn't all that bad of a sequel effort. When this one works, it's due to the usual round of high-intensity supernatural action set-pieces that are quite prominent in this style. Those early hauntings, from the first instances of the demonic happenings in the bedroom where it appears out of the shadows of their toys to scare him or the later scene of it throwing the bookshelf against the door in front of everyone, are genuinely creepy moments that work rather well here, and along with the special series of stalking scenes later on that really makes a much more prominent atmosphere that lets the scares come rather nicely. The scenes of the possessed daughter throwing around the furniture in the house, appearing as the demonic spirits to torment the family or the different sessions attempting to exorcise the spirit in front of the different sets of experts that are there to help them all give this one some rather intense and chilling encounters. Other big scenes, from the spirits' attack in the bedroom where it traps her in the locked room and begins wrapping her in the sheets as well as the big showcase freak-out in front of the research team where it appears to be all faked for their perspective that leads into the utterly thrilling finale as they finally attempt to wrest her from its control makes it all quite fun as there's a lot of chilling suspense in the ghostly figures appearing around the house, the action of needing to rescue her up in the bedroom and the attempt to confront the demon once and for all ends this one with a ton of fun and a great overall feel. Given that this one keeps the interest up once it gets to these scenes featuring plenty of continuous action to keep it going, there's plenty to like here even with a few minor flaws here. The biggest issue here is the rather cliché and unimpressive ghostly attacks which are found in the first half which is mainly a part of the demon nun attacking her in their house as these are typical and expected scares. Playing with shadows, close- ups of roaring demonic faces out of nowhere and intense scenes that prove to be dream sequences all show up throughout here, and they all drop off rather quickly than the films' later demonic scares. They're a part of the film's other problem in the exaggerated length that really didn't need to be, as the first half here is way too long in getting them over to the house so it feels a little lopsided in terms of action here. These do hold it back although it's not enough to really be a detriment.<br/><br/>Rated R: Violence, Language, children-in-jeopardy and underage smoking."

","*May Contain Spoilers*<br/><br/>Over the years we've been victim to the regurgitation of horror classics as well as sequel after sequel (to be fair, this is an aspect that has always existed within the horror genre) and to be honest, I haven't seen a horror for a long time that has made me feel even slightly creeped out, never mind scared! <br/><br/>That being said, The Conjuring 2 certainly starts off well with some very chilling moments and plenty of tension building. Luckily it doesn't fall into the trap of relying solely on jump scares which have recently become the norm. I did find myself during the occasional scene actually holding my breath in anticipation to see what would happen. <br/><br/>The issue arises later in the film where we get a very boring ending and a whole ""prophecy"" aspect that is ignored (perhaps it will be addressed in a later film). Not to mention that the ending had a somewhat rushed feel to it that deviated from the earlier pace of the film. <br/><br/>So I've given this film a 7, not because I think out of any film would would deserve a 7/10 but because taking the last decade or two of horrors I think it certainly did a better job than most. So my 7/10 is solely as a comparison to other horrors rather than a representation of earlier films."

","The original 'The Conjuring' was one of the best horror movies I had seen in a long time, a genuinely frightening and refreshingly unpredictable horror film that made for a welcome addition to the genre. I was just hoping that 'The Conjuring 2' didn't make the same mistakes as 'Sinister 2', which was a total disaster.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the hugely talented horror director James Wan ensured that didn't happen and produced a very commendable Conjuring sequel. Whilst 'The Conjuring 2' doesn't quite reach the same heights as the original, it's still a very solid horror with plenty of scares. As in the first movie, the tension builds nicely until the final quarter, when the pace is relentless.<br/><br/>I was impressed after originally fearing the worst for this sequel.

And it does work, because you do have a stellar pair who really have a great chemistry. It's not bloody horror, but it is horror that is able to have you at the edge of your seat"
"coolbkeyon","8","1","2","1 November 2016"," Great!!!
","This movie was an excellent sequel. James Wan really dug deep into the true story of the haunting in Britain. The Conuring movies really make people reconsider their religion because of the satanic/demonic things that can happen to anyone. It shows that Satan can test the faith of those that seek help in the wrong areas. The family was really depressed after their father/husband left them on their own. The children, mostly Janet, wanted something to comfort them. When they used the ouija board to do that they allowed a demonic presence to torture them. If it wasn't for the Warren's to save the day the demon Valak would've had their lives. Vera always does a good job when it comes to playing as a character that feels so much empathy for a family in need. And Patrick played his character well as a supportive and fearless husband. The movie overall was horrifying especially the paint scene. I had a hard time sleeping after watching it, even watching a second time had me up at night"
"ahmedn32004","6","1","2","19 October 2016"," Good movie bu lacking attention to details
","I liked the movie, the story, the acting, ..... etc. But the only thing annoyed me was that the direction was not that good. Two things made me say that. There is a scene where it rains on the road concrete where there was a small pond of water from earlier rain. When it started raining, it was pretty obvious that the rain was covering most of the pond not all of it which gives away the fact that this is just 'artificial rain'. Yeah we know artificial rain is the most used rain in movie industry but it cannot look like artificial rain. The thing is I wasn't paying attention and still I noticed it which is bad. <br/><br/>The other thing is I know movies based on true stories always have additional details for the sake of drama. But the director and the authors should pay attention to details. I mean the demon was so scared from the small cross in Ed's hand but he is totally OK and jumping around in a small room full of (at least) tens of crosses with different sizes. It was even moving them around the wall. This was just ridiculous to me. Being a true story this leaves me with the certainty that only one of those two contradicting facts have actually happened in the real story.<br/><br/>The movie had some other minor directing faults that shouldn't have gone under the radar of a professional director."
"blomgrenabigail","10","1","2","18 October 2016"," Great Movie
","The Conjuring 2<br/><br/>We always hear that the sequel can never compare to the first one. But in this case, the second installation of The Conjuring is definitely comparable to the first. They travel back in time in a whole different country. The cast is swapped with the exception of two people: the ¨ghostbusters¨ if you will. These little twists refresh the viewers who fell in love with the first movie. The Conjuring 2 kicks off with a blast from the past, as it sets in 1977. Lorraine claims that this case still haunts her. It begins with your average single-parent poor family hardly scraping by. They became not-your-average-family when an 11 year old started showing strange symptoms of possession. Her voice changed to a 76 year old man's and there were unexplained bumps in the night. As a result, they call in real life ghostbusters Lorraine and Ed Warren to their home for help.<br/><br/>The year 2016 has been filled with new horror movies all the time so it'd be easy for this sequel to get lost. But this is definitely blockbuster material. The actors were well casted, skilled, and fit their characters perfectly. At times the editing was cheesy and you could definitely tell it was fake. That part dulled down the scare factor that we all came for. <br/><br/>However, the film's twists, turns, and horrors keep viewers on the edge of their seats the entire time. Earplugs are advised when someone in the room next to you is watching the movie. The first Conjuring was thrilling, exciting, well made, and most of all, horrifying. The sequel lacks nothing. There isn't anything gory, so those with weak stomachs can still watch.<br/><br/>This movie will be a cult classic for years, to sum it up. People won't just forget there was a second one ever made. Like the movie Grease, people barely remember there was ever a sequel to the first. You don't even have to see the first Conjuring; only two characters are connected to the second."

","The Conjuring and its 2016 sequel are among those horror movies that totally blow your mind. The demonic forces and hovering spirits are present among us and may choose to interfere with our lives for one reason or another that has made them uncomfortable or mad and these movies are produced based on real stories of real people that were hunted by demons and crazy spirits. The script is neat, the acting's satisfactory, and the other elements are all fitting together just fine. Above all, the scary scenes are never exaggerated by blood splashes or extreme violence which, surprisingly, makes it even more horrifying 'cuz that's what you get to experience in your daily life no matter how much of a dull lifestyle you're getting to have. It's one movie you genuinely would be scared to even begin watching that you might prefer to play it in the daylight rather than night-time and this comes from a person who laughs at all the other horror movies. So brace yourselves to a real suffering before hitting on this babe!"
"freewebstennis","10","1","2","5 October 2016"," Best demon movie I recommend you to watch (but not alone)!
","Well I will give a honest opinion. Also I don't like to compare this movie with 1st one. <br/><br/>The scare tactic used in this film is different to the first. Oh! I am already comparing LOL!! You see a lot jump scare scenes in this movie. So if you have a weak heart, better watch it with ears closed. It not just the visual but the sound effects can make you jump. The portrait scene is probably the best scene in developing a tension in the audience. The mirror scene in trailer is also good. People were laughing out loud after every jump scare. It does not mean its not scary as some people here think so. They are laughing because it scared them and they don't want people around to know about it. Laughing probably makes them feel cool. So it's quite entertaining to see people going through all this. I loved it as I was there watching in the cinema hall on a late night show and the expressions of people around was priceless. I think this is the only film where I have witnessed too many jump scares which are actually horrific. There are many great horror movies and we know they get the tension build up slowly and in the process waste a lot of time. In this movie, it was not the case and that's what makes me watch it with more curiosity. But I recommend not to watch it alone especially if you are scared of demons. The Nun demon is damn scary for children. So keep your kids away. The jump scares can kill a old person with weak heart. So you better know what you are going to watch is actually entertaining but can be disturbing if you are alone. I am not so scared of demons but even I jumped when there was a jump scare situation. The TV scene did make me jump. I was not scared but it was too sudden and shocking which made me jump. I enjoyed this movie more than any demon movie because of this very reason. Go ahead if you want this experience! It has a mix of slow tension as well as jump scare scenes. Worth watching and yes it is the best demon movie I have ever seen!"
"the_real_Doc_Justice","10","1","2","3 October 2016"," A brilliantly crafted piece of cinema
","I don't often give a ten, but this time here goes my vote.<br/><br/>I didn't rush to see this one because I didn't care much about the first Conjuring. It is lost somewhere in my memory between Insidious and some other movie I forgot about. The design of the Anabelle doll bothered me to begin with.<br/><br/>Anyway, I finally watched The Conjuring 2, driven by favorable critics and word of mouth, and I am really glad I did.<br/><br/>Of course it's a James Wan ghost movie, so they throw everything in but the kitchen sink, although I think the kitchen sink got thrown out at some point, but I loved every part of the ride.<br/><br/>The Warren couple works in this one. There is real chemistry. The kids are all great. A kid in a horror movie is usually a low point, useful to generate compassion but also to make the rest of the cast look good, but there you have three of them, who seem to effortlessly deliver, well, anything. They performed so well I almost didn't notice.<br/><br/>The efficient reenactment of the 70's period is a real pleasure, but the movie doesn't just rely on the tricks (and bells, and whistles) of that proficient era. I really think they tried to sponge out ideas and mood from recent horror greats. I felt some Babadook in there. And a hint of It Follows maybe.<br/><br/>Clearly the creative department (because there is plenty of creativity nonetheless) tried hard on this, which is great, because they didn't have to. They would have made their money anyway.<br/><br/>Thank you Mr Wan. Very hard."
"Reno-Rangan","7","1","2","24 September 2016"," This time a London family struggle in their haunted house.
","First of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.<br/><br/>A family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.<br/><br/>The one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","How many times have you gone into the sequel fearing it won't be as good as the first? Well you have nothing to fear here... that's not totally true; you do have something to fear here you have a lot to fear with The Conjuring 2 which I believe is far better than the first one.<br/><br/>James Wan really pulls out the scares in the follow up to his 2013 The Conjuring. The story focuses on the Enfield haunting. Set in 1977 London, England; Peggy Hodgson is a single mum of five children who asks for help after she believes her youngest daughter Janet maybe possessed. Ed and Lorraine Warren are sent to investigate.<br/><br/>Not only am I impressed with the scares in the film which come in the form of jump scares and slow burn tension building I am really impressed with the way James Wan recreates England in the 70's. For someone that isn't even from the country I have to give credit for the amount of research that must have gone into this project to get the feeling right.<br/><br/>The movie has a great cast with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprising their roles as Lorraine and Ed Warren; they are joined with great performances by Frances O'Connor who plays Peggy Hodgson, Lauren Esposito who plays Margaret Hodgson and the stand out performance from Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson.<br/><br/>When it comes to real life hauntings like the story this film is based on I am somewhat of a skeptic, I don't believe in ghost so in order for me to enjoy a film that is advertised as the true story from the case files of the Warrens I have to try really hard to turn the skeptic side of my brain off and enjoy it for what it is... Which is one of the most scariest films I've seen in a long time."
"quinimdb","6","1","2","18 September 2016"," The. Conjuring 2
","There is a series of scenes in ""The Conjuring 2"" that left me holding my breath at many moments, and these scenes in the first half of the film are honestly very scary. This makes it all the more upsetting when suddenly it turns into a corny supernatural thriller towards the end, with an incredibly cheesy and contrived scene involving the characters sitting in the back of an ambulance after the climax (does anyone else feel like this type of scene has become a trope?).<br/><br/>The early scenes of the film do a good job recreating not just the look of the time and place, but the zeitgeist of it. We get to know this family, who is basically just a normal working class family, with a single mother.<br/><br/>The scariest moments in the film begin with Janet suddenly waking up on the floor. Downstairs. She walks back upstairs, and then begins to talk to herself in two completely different voices. Suddenly, Margaret hears from behind her ""This is my house"" in a deep, scratchy voice. She turns around. There is no one. This is the genius of the scenes things happen, but then there's nothing every time, and the viewer is just waiting for the moment when things go really wrong, but it's not coming. This is suspense, and this is horror. Another great moment is when Billy walks downstairs to get water. When he is walking back up, you can subtly see someone sitting in the leather chair to his right in the other room, but it's just a silhouette. Now the viewer is really on edge. He goes upstairs and suddenly his toy firetruck goes off. He turns it off and pushes it back into the tent. When he walks over to his bed, we hear the toy go off and roll out of the tent once again, and Billy freezes. He leans back and we think he is about to go turn it off and in our minds we think ""no don't do it!"" Then he starts to get back into his bed, then once again he leans back and the camera follows him, and we think ""No!"" Then he goes into his bed all the way. But the camera stays looking out into the hallway for just enough time to be completely on edge and aware that something is about to happen. Then the kid comes back into frame, but when he goes back into his bed this time, the camera moves with him. We are relieved for a second, then suddenly we hear the firetruck roll into the room. He turns it off, walks back over to his tent, rolls it into the tent, then it is rolled right back out, facing the opposite direction, and when the boy grabs it, we immediately hear a loud scream from a grown man. This is one of the two very effective jump-scares in the film (the second being the ""MY HOUSE"" jumpscare, with the old man and the remote control), because of how long it takes to build up its tension, and then how unexpectedly it hits you. There was no face popping out, just a scream. It earns the jumpscare with the tension.<br/><br/>All of this great tension building is thrown out of the window in the second half of the film however, in favor of a corny supernatural thriller with a message of ""help others, especially when no one else will"". There is nothing wrong with the message, but the way it is integrated into the film does not mesh very well with any sort of serious horror, and the whole film becomes very over the top and silly. There is a single moment I can think of where I genuinely felt for one of the characters, and this was when Maurice was talking about his dead daughter.<br/><br/>Even the all of the entities in the house become not at all scary, because we are shown so much of them for so long, that we get used to it. Also, the crooked man just looks silly in general, he looks like a tall stop motion animated figure, and the way he moves is almost cartoony. The jump-scares become much more predictable, and there is only a single moment I can remember that had me genuinely tense.<br/><br/>This moment was short, but it was when Ed was reaching down into the water to find something, just after Peggy had been bitten under water. There's already tension that he will also be bitten, but at the edge of the frame as the camera is zooming in on Ed, there is a head only slightly above water. This seriously put me on edge, and then there was no jump-scare, so it forced me to stay pretty tense. This was a smart moment because of its subtlety, and subtlety, many don't realize, is the key to horror. Seeing doors slam and things fly across the room isn't scary, in fact it gets boring pretty quickly. Seeing a silhouette figure near the edge of the frame, that the characters don't notice, but you know is right there, THAT'S scary."

Well, enter James Wan: he makes a flick for some 10's of millions (40 here) and it makes hundreds at the box office (320 to be exact). Why is that? Coz they work, that's why! So I saw it because it got good reviews but even then I was full of suspicion. But yeah, like I said before: it works. Not because it really does something new -it doesn't- but because it does what it does very well. The movie feels fresh and entertaining and never bores despite its 2 hour running time.

","As sequels go, then ""The Conjuring 2"" seems to fall into the same trap as many other movies do, and it didn't manage to surpass or live up to the first movie in the franchise.<br/><br/>That being said, don't get me wrong here. I am not saying that ""The Conjuring 2"" is a bad movie, it just didn't manage to reach the same level of intensity or be as scary as the first movie did. It does still have some impressive moments here and there.<br/><br/>The story is focusing on the actual 1970's Enfield haunting phenomena that revolved around the Hodgson family. However, ""The Conjuring 2"" is not the first movie to portray these disturbing events. And it did an adequate job in doing so, perhaps mostly because of the aid of the actors and actresses portraying the various characters. Storywise, then ""The Conjuring 2"" didn't bring anything new to the table.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson really carries this movie quite nicely with his performance and portrayal of the Ed Warren character. And while he is not the one that the movie revolves around, he still steals the show to the point where he is the focal point.<br/><br/>The effects in ""The Conjuring 2"" were quite good, as they have to be in a ghost movie. A ghost or haunting movie without proper effects is an immediate killer to the movie. I will say that the special effects team here really did a good job, especially since the effects were doing what they were intended to do, and doing so without being flashy enough to steal away focus from the movie.<br/><br/>I was already familiar with the Enfield haunting story, so there was little new here. But still, director James Wan did manage to handle the story nicely.<br/><br/>As with the first movie, then it was nice to revisit the cellar of the Warren home. There are so many interesting pieces to be seen there, and a myriad of possible stories to be told on the screen.<br/><br/>While ""The Conjuring 2"" is not a groundbreaking movie, it is still enjoyable and entertaining enough for what it was. Just don't expect to be blown away. A fair enough continuation of the first movie, albeit it hardly did the first movie much justice.<br/><br/>My rating of ""The Conjuring 2"" is a mediocre five out of ten stars."

","The Conjuring 2 is a direct sequel to the first Conjuring and is once again directed by James Wan. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are back on the leading roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, the paranormal investigators. Also stars Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Simon McBurney, Franka Potente and Lauren Esposito among others. The film is based on the true story, that follows Ed and Lorraine Warren trying to help a family with their problems with paranormal forces in Brimsdown, Enfield council house in 1977, what is their most documented paranormal case ever. This is one of the best horror movies ever made in my opinion, and it is much better than the first film which I also really liked. What this movie does is benefit from a great horror director who clearly knows how to inject good scares with amazing use of camera- work and tension building that result to thrilling scenes and make for a great movie overall. All of the actors do a fantastic job, with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga on the lead who have great chemistry with each other and make us really feel for their characters when stuff with the demons is going down. Also, Madison Wolfe gives one of the best kid performances on screen ever. She is just brilliant and carries entire scenes on her own, with her amazing gifted ability to act and it might just be me but she is totally Oscar worthy here. Much better than all the kids in Stranger Things combined, even though I know that's a TV Shows by comparison, but just on the acting scale of things she deserves much more recognition for this role . Since the movie is over two hours, by the end it does feel like it is going on for a bit too long, and the ending in itself is a bit too much in the sense that the way they defeat the demon and resolve the case felt like cheating to me. But either way those are the only small issues that I have with this wonderful film which I loved and I can't wait to see what's in store for this universe."

","If you haven't seen the movie, I urge you not to read this review as it contains spoilers and basically will ruin the whole experience.<br/><br/>As far as horror movies go, Conjuring 2 is among the scariest I've seen. Decent plot, a little too much at times and I wonder if the movie could have ended in the traditional 1 hour and a half, but still, worth your time if what your looking is a good shoulder exercise.<br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine Warren continue their search for paranormal activity this time in England, where a family is haunted by a spirit that claims ownership of their home, and apparently, the body of one of the little girls. <br/><br/>Story starts with Lorraine having a vision of a young boy, who, while possessed by an evil entity, murders his whole family, parents-2 brothers-1 sister, in their sleep with a shotgun. Even though the scene started with his mother yelling at him before she hit the sheets of her bed covered in blood and the blast of the shotgun, his 2 brothers somehow continue sleeping unaffected by the hell that broke loose 3 meters away. The scene continues with the brother(the viewer actually sees Lorraine as she envisions the whole massacre) entering the bedroom of his two brothersm and initially shoots the 1st boy. 2nd boy is still sleeping despite his mothers screams and the 3 shotgun booms, so he also ends up dead. Sister in a 3rd room equally doesn't hear the 4 now gunshots and subsequently ends up dead.<br/><br/>The Warrens eventually end up in Britain to investigate the haunted house case on behalf of the Church that wishes to put an end to the families screams. Decent acting and some pretty scary scenes follow, but before the Warrens, the police is called up to the scene, when the spirit for the first time decides to become a little too friendly with the Hodgsons. 2 officers, a woman and a man arrive to investigate and actually witness a chair without a driver, gracefully slide across the floor in front of them also in the presence of the single mother who now owns the house and a neighbor who offered to help. Scene is actually pretty good, but what follows surely isn't. After they see with their own eyes something that would make any living soul, sh*t in his pants, all 4 exit the house pretending nothing happened. No running like headless chickens, no stumbling on the floor, going through windows, or even a scream. 2 officers actually stand in front of the haunted house and explain to the lady why they couldn't file a report about it.<br/><br/>Plot continues with the Warren's stepping in and finally managing to defeat the spirit. While doing so a thunder cuts a tree just outside of the house in half, which was a pretty decent touch and so were the scenes inside the house up to the point that the neighbor from before attempts to chop a door down with an ax while inside world war 3 was climaxing. Movie finishes without him managing to enter that door, despite the fact that Lorraine squeezed in, and just before the end, 4 neighbors in total come to celebrate the demise of the paranormal. House is almost demolished, screams, a thunder, and in the morning no one beside the victims and the ghost hunters seemed to care.<br/><br/>Apart from these 3-4 mistakes in my opinion, film was actually pretty good but a little too long."
"theaarnman","5","1","2","28 July 2016"," A cinema entertainment, not much more
","The Conjuring relied mostly on jump scares and thrilling long sequences that would make you wait for something showing up right in your face – The Conjuring 2 relies on the same concept, but with a demon hunting the hunters themselves and a different case of paranormal activities, in England.<br/><br/>I am a sucker for British people living in the suburbs or small outer areas with thick accents, needless to say This is England is one of my favourite movies (and series). But, I still got quite sceptic when this movie started with a rip off of TIEs' intros/starts (they go through what's happening in England ""right now"" to music with TV-clips) and The Conjuring 2 took that and made it to the very classic London Calling (The Clash). Taking a concept is never a nice move, and especially not at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>The rest was a very typical horror/paranormal movie. Not much special, but it definitely works while watching it at a cinema, but if I had watched it home on my computer I'd probably start doing something else while watching.<br/><br/>The animation (and some of the effects) was poorly executed. It was so, so, badly made. I cannot understand how they didn't notice it? The demon, Valak, is a nun. The original Valak is not a nun, so they basically just took a cool name and went with it. Apparently they made the design for the demon at the final cuts, and that is definitely noticeable. Ed (one of the main characters) got his first cross from a nun, so maybe it's some symbolism but that doesn't cover it for me. The Crooked Man (also a creature) was poorly animated, but creepy when it was shown in shadows (reminded me of Babadook) but in light it looked like a cartoon character. When the child that became possessed eyes turned yellow at her most ""controlled"" part and I could just think about how POORLY IT WAS MADE. Why rely on animation when you can create intense feelings with just shadows and sounds? I don't understand.<br/><br/>The events that this movie was based on had nothing to do with these creatures and demons, so the based on a true story concept is kind of ?? NOT EVEN TRUE ?? (But what do you expect)<br/><br/>I had no trouble with the child actors though. One of the children was supposed to be stuttering all the time, but that magically disappeared in the middle of the movie. One thing I liked was that Judy, that got possessed, was a very kind person. It felt so unfair that she was getting into this mess.<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>To the ending. I absolutely hated it, and I think that was the poorest done thing with this movie. It ended happy, not even a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>It would've been so good if Ed or Judy died. It would be like Satan, or the demon won over them and faith can't predict everything (or stop some things). It's not common to have important characters die, but since the movie isn't much based on the real events they could go with something new, and make the movie unique.<br/><br/>I don't know, it just felt so weird since everyone was screaming and crying 15 minutes before these scenes?<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDED<br/><br/>I think that overall it was an okay film, perfect to watch in the cinemas and exciting with jump scares but not a long lasting bone- chilling. (unless you're afraid of nuns). Good actors, Vera Farmiga is amazing as usual and I think that the cinematography and aesthetics (except the demons) were ""okay""."
"dave118118","5","1","2","13 July 2016"," Nothing here for seasoned horror fans
","I re-watched the first one on Friday night and enjoyed it a lot more than the first time I watched it. Having seen nearly all of the James Wan Horror films (Insidious, Annabelle, Saw) you have to appreciate that The Conjuring 1 & 2 are the best of these types of 'horror' film. <br/><br/>I say 'horror' because this isn't true horror. There is nothing in any of these films that any long time horror fan hasn't seen many times before. James Wan seems to have an approach where instead of trying to avoid the clichés and tropes of modern day horror, he just throws EVERY conceivable 'trick' into a blender and hopes for the best. The first few scares of Conjuring 2 fell completely flat with me. Just when I was beginning to lose all hope of seeing anything remotely scary, they did just about start to improve.<br/><br/>One of the things that really grated me with the first film, was the horribly out of tone use of 'Time of the season' by The Zombies and a completely pointless long shot. An odd tone shift that doesn't suit anything before or after it in the film. The sequel suffers from similar unwarranted tone changes. Patrick Wilson pulling out his guitar to give a rendition of an Elvis song is this films 'Time of the season'. It just doesn't work. In fairness though, this is an attempt at character development, it doesn't work, but at least they tried.<br/><br/>Another major gripe is that all of the Enfield based English characters sound like they've been taught diction by Don Cheadle in Oceans 11. Or perhaps Wan told them to base their accents on that little lad from Bedknobs & Broomsticks? Either way it's off putting and distracting.<br/><br/>Watching a James Wan produced/directed horror film is the cinematic equivalent of accompanying a toddler through the haunted house at the local fair; The loud noisy things that keep jumping out are very effective at scaring the younger ones, but only because it's all new to them."
"Deimos-remus","1","1","2","12 July 2016"," High-hopes sequel that does not live up to its potential
","::This review may contain potential minor spoilers, but no blatant and major giveaways::<br/><br/>The first Conjuring was something of a very nice surprise for me. I'm not one to usually buy into major release Horror films, but heard so many good things about it from audiences and critics alike that I caved in. What I didn't expect was that it ended up being a very solid and very traditionally done ghost story, with effective character development and slow burn buildup. It had its moments of cheap jump-scares and gags here and there, but overall it was surprisingly effective. <br/><br/>Jump forward to the sequel, and there's problems from the start. To parrot its predecessor, the film opens with a previous case of the Warrens (this time the infamous Amityville haunting). Though the Annabelle sequence from the first film felt a bit contrived, it was still effective, it didn't run away with the 'cliche creepy doll' thing too much and the sequence was creepy, despite being relatively mundane. The Amityville sequence thrusts the viewer into a jump-scare filled climax right off the bat, leading the way for the inconsistently toned and paced remainder of the film. The immediate next gripe was setting the scene for London. Using the Clash's London Calling, along with kiddies calling each other that word that starts with 'W' and rhymes with Tanker (a word that apparently makes IMDb's prohibited word list) made the viewer very well aware that the film takes place in jolly old England. I don't think I could've come up with more painfully obvious and groan-worthy (not to mention cliché and distilled) references to English culture if I tried. Already, the movie was off to a bit of a rocky start, but I gave it a chance. I really did. So from here, I will point out some of the things the film did do right. <br/><br/>The performances are all handled well, and the kids are particularly strong in their roles. Wilson and Fermiga are once again, a believable on-screen couple. The strong eerie atmosphere from the first film is back and better than before, as the camera compositions and movements are much more dynamic and interesting. The entities in the Conjuring 2 are a bit of a mixed bag however. On one hand, the old man in the chair is appropriately subdued and fairly nuanced, but then you have a demonic nun, that while creepy enough, has a design that feels old and tried, and felt as though it was trying too hard. Lastly, you got the Crooked Man, which while rather cool looking I must admit, felt pretty out-of-place within the grounded reality the narrative set up thus far, contributing to the film's already inconsistent nature. For a dark horror movie, The Conjuring 2 also felt unnaturally sappy and saccharine. While some moments of levity among the scares and foreboding terror are more than welcome, much of the dialogue reeked of forced sentimentality and hammy cheese, ultimately taking me out of the horror of it all. <br/><br/>So, to recap, the Conjuring 2 is far from being a bad film. It outperforms its predecessor in some ways, but falls very low in others. Its tonal inconsistencies make for a very odd structure, yet one that is still rather predictable. It still looks very good, and delivers on some chilling moments, but isn't nearly as effective as the first in this ever-growing franchise."

"alexandreberiau","6","1","2","26 June 2016"," Scary but lazy script
","**This review is a detailed review without any spoilers, so you can know if it contains some stuff you like or don't.**<br/><br/>I'll tell you right now, the movie is scary. I made some jumps and had chills on the first half of it and then some parts in the second half. The atmosphere is great, the spirits are scary as hell, but it is sometimes wasted on cheap jump scares that you can see miles away.<br/><br/>What throws me off was the doggy thing where it reminds you of a poor version of then babadook character which in this case is absolutely useless to put into the script. <br/><br/>The way the characters interact is something we've seen millions of time in bad horror movies that throw you out of the ""reality"" of the movies. What i mean by that is when we look at the first movie, the characters were not venturing alone in the dark like in every other stupid horror movies, they were going as a group, except for one time. But in this movie, every character doesn't seems to realize that the ghost can actually hurt them even after multiples encounters. <br/><br/>One more stupid thing is the ending. The script on how they find out how to beat the spirit is so dumb, i never thought a super spirit would allow them to beat him in a single stupid attempt. It's almost as the spirit committed suicide for no reason at all. There needs to be an investigation for a movie to have a suspenseful ending, but sadly this movie decided to go for the cheap way.<br/><br/>Overall, go for it if you like the Insidious series, it's pretty much the same, but if you expect a great movie script with a good intrigue, this is not the case."

","Since the advent of the first Paranormal Activity film, Hollywood, and in particular James Wan, have had an obsession with the Quiet.........Quiet...........Quiet.............Bang!!! Element of horror cinema.<br/><br/>And the cinemas have been infected with these films since 2009. The are seldom rarely scary, but they do have that irritating knack of making you jump, just because they turn up the scare shriek volume up to eleven and let the dark corners of rooms do the work.<br/><br/>Now, whilst The Conjuring 2 pretty much follows the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' laws of horror, it really reigns in the loud noises to make you jump, hence making it one of the more interesting horror movies to be released in cinemas for a very long time.<br/><br/>But there is still a lot of work to do, especially when you consider the Mini-Series 'The Enfield Haunting', which starred Timothy Spall.<br/><br/>In 1977, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren travel to London, England, where single mother Peggy Hodgson believes that something evil is in her home. <br/><br/>When Peggy's youngest daughter starts showing signs of demonic possession, Ed and Lorraine attempt to help the besieged girl, and her family. <br/><br/>But they only vex the demon, and find themselves targeted by the malicious spirits.....<br/><br/>It's a pretty audacious move by the makers to have the opening ten minutes set in one of the most famous horror houses of all, Amityville, because they are potentially setting themselves up to fail, or setting themselves up for a third movie, to give us a taste of things to come, ala Insidious.<br/><br/>But once we are re-directed to London (which is pointed out to us by having The Clash's London Calling playing over the scene), the film becomes more intense, thanks to the performances of the children, particularly Janet.<br/><br/>The film has all your regular clichés which are found in these films, silly long corridors with a tent at one end, faces in mirrors, and best of all, a painting of a nun, that is so genuinely terrifying, it's garnered its own spin-off (again).<br/><br/>If you can get over the ri-Dick Van Dyke-ulous accents, and the fact that if you listen to the Radio 5 Film Programme, the demon sounds like Simon Mayos real voice, this is a pretty decent, if slightly overlong horror.<br/><br/>But pleas check out The Enfield Haunting too."

Annabelle was spin off the first and was not even scary, and had more gore than both of these two together and did not get scary.

"snowfre","8","1","3","30 October 2019"," A horror sequel that - surprisingly - is as good as its predecessor
","Following the success of ""The Conjuring"", there are no surprises that James Wan would throw out a sequel in his newly created MCU-esque horror universe. ""The Conjuring 2"" (actually nice to have a horror movie sequel without an overly long subtitle) has the Warrens (Wilson and Farmiga) go across the pond to help an allegedly possessed girl in the oh-so-rainy City of London. The warning signs are clear, this might be a repetitive, dumb sequel. But it isn't. I would probably argue that it is actually better than its predecessor. The pure haunted house kind of thrill is present in this film as well, and the gloomy, grey atmosphere of England (as usually depicted in American films) gives the film an extra spice, separating it both visually and emotionally from the first film. A step up from the first movie is also the supporting cast, the Hodgsons (with its matriarch played well by O'Connor) are utterly sympathetic and it brings an extra thing that is at stake. Let them have a merry Christmas you evil spirits. As for Wilson and Farmiga, they feel like they are warm in their clothes and have a great dynamic, also adding to the likeness of the ensemble. ""The Conjuring 2"" is a very good horror movie, with some very chilling, skin crawling scenes and it serves as a very worthy successor despite the still present lack of originality. I must also admit, as a hardcore horror fan, the few scenes featuring the Nun are almost unbearably intense to watch. So horror fans, enjoy another horror spectacle from Wan. Because it is at least very enjoyable, despite the absence of risk taking in terms of movie making."

","I was very surprised when the reviews started coming out for this movie. I honestly dimised the Conjuring Two as I was of the belief that sequels to horror movies tend to not only be worse than the original but also bring down the reputation of the original movies name.
So I didn't go to the cinema to watch it. A choice I ultimately came to regret as after finally sitting down and watching this movie I came to thoroughly enjoy it.
This movie pays perfect respect to previous horror movies in the same sub genre by using a lot of the classic techniques that have bee used previously to make the audience feel uneasy. However it gets away with it because it does it well. You may have heard a very similar story before but This movie is still worth watching because it's been written and directed so well with fantastic cinematography and screenplay with a great cast of classic horror movie characters. The panicking mother, the Terrified children the confused friend that doubts the sanity of her close friend that she knows so well.
The plot develops in an interesting way and achieves some genuinely scary moments with a great amount of intrigue that keeps you commited to watching.

","Recent horror movies are not horror movies at all: screamers and slashers can't be considered as scary.

But here comes the giant NO.
The atmosphere of the film is really intense, we can things we have been afraid as children and desperation.
Valak, enigmatic and powerful demon, who was playing with the family and used a ghost to get his own body. You haven't expected it, have you? All of this, added with an almost iconic soundtrack, which is chilling your back at night.
I've watched hundreds of horror movies, but all of them lacked good acting or good music or just being a horror movie. The Conjuring is definitely a game changer, which sets a very high benchmark for horrors."

","Sure, there is some truth to the story, in the sense that two girls made up a story of possession (which has been thoroughly debunked) and that Maurice Grosse was there as a paranormal investigator. With him was Guy Playfair (not depicted in this movie) while the Warrens were hardly involved at all. A far better, and more frightening dramatization of these events is the British mini-series The Enfield Haunting, although that, like this, does conclude that the haunting was real. Great cast, inspired by an interesting story, but frankly, the movie turned out quite boring and not particularly frightening."

","The Conjuring 2 (2016)<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) are coming off the Amityville case when they decide to take a break. This break doesn't last too long as Ed has a vision of a possessed nun, which is the same person Lorraine previously saw. Meanwhile over in London a mother and her four children are being haunted by an evil spirit, which appears to be attached to an elderly man.<br/><br/>THE CONJURING came out of nowhere and become a huge hit among critics and horror fans. The box office numbers meant a sequel was bound to follow since the number one rule with horror films is that if one makes money you rush another into production. Thankfully this film wasn't rushed into production and it's great that they actually took their time to deliver a good screenplay. I must admit that I'm quite shocked but I thought the film was much better and much creepier than the first film.<br/><br/>Director James Wan is really becoming an expert at these types of films and this here is certainly among the best that has been made. I thought the first film was quite good due to its performances and a nice story but I didn't find a single thing creepy. That certainly wasn't the case here as the movie had my blood turning cold several times including the before mentioned nun, which was downright creepy at times. I also thought the first hour was perfectly done as the director slowly builds up the suspense and once it hits he just keeps it going with one sequence after another. I will say that the ""crooked man"" didn't work and the finale wasn't as great as I was hoping but these are just small issues.<br/><br/>Once again the film really benefits from the two great leads performances. Both Wilson and Farmiga are perfectly believable in their roles and they certainly sell the viewer that everything you're watching is actually happening. Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor are also very good in their supporting roles as is Simon McBurney. The film also benefits from some terrific cinematography and a very eerie music score. On a technical level the film is very impressive and this here helps build up the atmosphere.<br/><br/>THE CONJURING 2 is a very rare sequel that actually manages to be much better than the first film. It also shows why sequels shouldn't be rushed into production and that if you take your time with them something as good as this can be made."

","After checking the reviews of this movie on this site I couldn't wait to watch it. I really enjoyed the first one so I though, hey, this should be great. Was I wrong.... Let me just say, I absolutely love horror movies but for me it must be so scary that I am tempted to actually stop watching the movie. With this movie, I was tempted to stop watching it for a whole other reason. I found it to be extremely predictable and quite boring. One big horror movie cliché - and not actually scary at all..

"sie_francis82","7","1","3","4 July 2016"," Wan back to doing what he does best!
","One of the better horror movies to emerge from the last decade finally gets a follow up with The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case. Director James Wan is back to doing what he does best after indulging himself hopelessly in the Furious franchise - something I've not entirely forgiven him for. Now that he has that out of his system, he fleets back to the one franchise still very much appreciated, that is if we quietly disregard Annabelle (2014) - something I have most definitely not forgiven him for. The Enfield Case has everything you want in a sequel; the setting, London, England 1977 and we see the return of the ever palpable Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as our favourite ghost-hunters, Ed and Lorraine Warren. Although, those of you who managed to catch the, quite brilliant, three part series on Sky 1, The Enfield Haunting, will have been subjected to some unfortunate spoilers. But worry not, there's more to this story than a great way to tell it and, after a small time-out, Wan doesn't hold back on the big-budget- scares.<br/><br/>Enfield, North London is the birthplace of one of the most documented hauntings in British history where the Hodgeson family were subjected to a series of ghastly shenanigans. In particular, the youngest daughter of the family, Janet, played here by a precocious Madison Wolfe, who is tormented and sometimes embodied by the spirit of a previous resident, Bill Wilkins. When the incidents become more frequent the family turn to the church for sanctuary who, in turn, contacts Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate. Meanwhile, Lorraine is facing her own demons and is haunted by the spirit of the Amityville case who gives her a terrifying premonition of Ed's death.<br/><br/>One thing that makes this movie a cut above most horror that has been recently released is that it is very well made. Wan captures the bleak and impoverished conditions of the late 1970's working class. For those who lived and were raised through the late 70's, early 80's, there is a strong sense of familiarity. The patterned curtains, mismatched bedspreads and garish wallpaper, Wan taps into a familiar fear of helplessness that comes with those childhood memories; or even that uneasy feeling you get when you enter a musty, old house of the recently deceased. <br/><br/>Though most of the suspense stems from Wan's ability to make your skin crawl, he isn't afraid to parade the obvious scare. His excessive use of quick camera shifts make it easy predict when a big jump is coming, with the old, 'it's behind you!' trick, but it makes you feel rather ashamed when he still manages to get you; especially when you're too old to hide your eyes behind your fingers so you revert to muttering expletives under your breath. The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case is a popcorn horror for the nonchalant. It's a testament to Wan's style of film-making. The haunted house / possession genre has exhausted all of its resources but, regardless of his critics, Wan does not pretend that he has reinvented the wheel. Instead, he throws everything into the boiling pot for it to ultimately reach its over-produced, climactic ending; gratuitous entertainment."

","While I enjoyed the original ""Conjuring,"" I was left a little wanting. I thought if the first 60 minutes of the film had been as intense as the last 30, it would have been a great horror tale. Well, Director James Wan has created its sequel and, let me tell you, it is one intense ride. <br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine Warren (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are back as the paranormal couple who go where few dare to tread. They are asked to investigate a supposed haunting/possession of a 12-year old girl in England named Janet Hodgson. It seems she has been tormented by the ghost of a 71 year old man who died in the house her family now inhabits. Oh, but leave it to Wan to make it so much more than that!<br/><br/>As in the original ""Conjuring,"" this story opens with a reference to another case of alleged possession--the Amityville mass murders. While investigating there, Lorraine keeps having premonitions of her husband's impending death. She also discovers a very dark and evil presence, which decides to take the form of a demented nun.<br/><br/>James Wan shows he is a master of this genre. He also shows that an audience can be scared to death simply by using camera tricks, shadows, and effective make-ups. His actors deliver top-notch performances, especially Madison Wolfe who plays the tormented child. <br/><br/>To me, this film (as the original) should have been rated PG-13. There is no blood, gore, nudity, or sexual situations. In fact, I have racked my brain trying to remember if I even heard a cuss word and, for the life of me, I don't. However, don't let the lack of those hackneyed and worn out situations stop you from seeing this movie. It is the best horror movie I have seen in a long time, and I will even admit, I had trouble sleeping the night after I saw the movie. Enjoy!"

","I went into the cinema with low expectations because i saw so many things about how good the conjuring 2 is. I thought that I would be disappointed but I was very wrong. The conjuring 2 is fast paced and well written. The story doesn't just focus on the horror but it also focuses a lot on the characters. There are some character building scenes but none of them waste time. They are all very meaningful. I felt much more connected to this family than the last one. You sympathize a lot with these characters. Everyone is trying to fight their own battles and overcome their obstacles. <br/><br/>The horror is very scary. James Wan managed to make a very terrifying atmosphere. He knows how to build up suspense and he knows how to use jump scares. There were quite a few jump scares in this film but none of them were false.Some were very predictable but most of them caught me off guard. What made this really scary is the fact that it was in a normal house . It wasn't in some big American house with eight bedrooms and three floors.It was in an average British council house.<br/><br/>The acting was very good and everyone did a great job. I felt glued to the screen and felt engaged with the story. The cinematography and lightning was very good. The camera work was absolutely amazing. <br/><br/>The only reason why I'm giving it 9/10 is because I felt that the last 10 minutes was way too much. It was very extreme and messy. I didn't really feel engaged. However, many people felt that the ending was good and well written so I'm not going to say that the ending was a bad thing. It was just a bit too much for me. <br/><br/>But overall this was a very good movie and if you're looking for something to creep you out and make you feel scared then watch the Conjuring 2."

","Janet- at the very first few glances, pops up a question- where did she school her brilliant acting talent? That makes the other brilliance around her shallow. The movie is slow and boring in the beginning.. But definitely keeps your seat belts still buckled up cos you know, at the back of your mind- it's based on a real story and the inhuman demon's horror lingers within seconds of its appearance. The movie slowly takes over you and the boring haunted house horror makes you a part of those characters in the movie. Once you are in it, the yellow eyes, the unkempt hair, the redness of scare on the white faces ... All begin to horrify you... Mrs/ms.Valak will definitely crumple your face to frighten..but, Mr. Ed and Lorrainze , with the help of Lord Jesus and the holy bible and the holy crucifix and of course their exorcist talent to communicate with the spirits, win the game against the super strong spirits... Just like any horror Hollywood movie. Last 20 minutes of the movie is the real horror. The initial boring parts of the movie is the leap into the characters to make you feel the horror. No cheap horrifying makeup. Subtle makeup, sensible movie. THE CONJURING 2."
"matthewssilverhammer","7","1","3","20 June 2016"," The Crooked Man always did seem like a creepy nursery rhyme...
","James Wan, perhaps the premiere modern horror director (""Saw,"" ""Insidious""), makes graphically regal films that often exceed the genre's visual conventions. His popular ""Conjuring"" films give him the opportunity to show that skill. With gorgeous period-piece settings, the general warmness to the coloring works as a nice counterpoint to the scares. While this newest entry doesn't quite sidestep all of the clichés in modern horror (giggling children, creepy toys, red herring scares), it does askew some. The just-brainy-enough storytelling mixed with the super strong direction make it a distinctly solid studio horror trip. Based on ""true events,"" we find paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren traveling to the UK to study a peculiar and sinister haunting of a young, single-parent family. Along the way, some plot conveniences and illogical creature rules haunt the proceedings. Luckily, these are overshadowed by some fantastically creepy monster designs, including a boldly sadistic nun-figure and a terrifying rendition of the ""Crooked Man"" nursery rhyme, all underscored by effectively cool music and sound design. By now, Wan has proved he knows what he's doing in the scare department. However, some surprisingly adept humor cuts through the horrific drama, allowing the themes of family and dangerous commitment to shine through. But what really makes the whole thing work are the people. In spite of the few plotting flaws, in the center of the story are characters you wanna root for. They are funny, loving, sympathetic and real; they are human-feeling people who make human-feeling decisions. With this beautiful control over tone and character, Wan feels only a step away from making a true masterpiece. Until then, this will more than do."

It was very hard for me to take this movie seriously and, the aforementioned unintentionally funny bits they are very few and far between. <br/><br/>VERDICT: I would not recommend it personally, it wasn't ironically good but it wasn't unironically good."

","The Warrens are back with a new case to solve and a new demon to cast out. The Conjuring 2 reunites us with Ed and Lorraine Warren 6 years after the events of The Conjuring, This time the Ghostbusting dynamic duo are called to Enfield England to help a family of 5 in what would become the longest recorded paranormal case in history. Following the previous films three stages of possession the film escalates perfectly and unfortunately for Ed and Lorraine, they have become targeted by this demon as well.<br/><br/>The return of the Conjuring also sees the return of Director James Wan, back to the series and the horror genre after directing 2015's Fast and Furous 7. Wan knocks it out the park yet again with this horror movie sequel. The tension is unbearable, the imagery is horrifying and the film is scary as f*ck. This film puts Wan's tension building ability to the test and Wan rises to the occasion, making several scenes borderline unbearable to watch. The Conjuring 2 wouldn't be as good as it is if James Wan didn't direct. The film proves once again why James Wan is the best horror director working today.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is great. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprises their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren, this time adding a more personal touch (and awesome Elvis impression) to their respected characters. The chemistry the two have is believable and brings a human touch to this paranormal horror film. Like the first film the child actors are good (great by child actor standards), especially Madision Wolfe who is great as the tormented and occasionally possessed Janet Hodgson.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel there was a wasted opportunity when the Amityville case was glossed over at the films start. Although the opening is wonderfully shot (similarly to NBC's Hannibal) I still think it could have been its own conjuring sequel. The films foreshadowing of events was rather obvious except such as the focus on the dog bell and he crooked man toy etc. Speaking of the crooked man, the scene where the dog transforms into the crooked man didn't really fit in and was almost laughable due to how bizarre and wtf the moment was.<br/><br/>Overall the Conjuring 2 is a well acted, well directed horror film that is overflowing with tension and that also has heart. This film marks a successful start to the Conjuring sequel series and hopefully there are more to come, and more importantly that James Wan acts as director for them."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","1","3","13 June 2016"," Decent Followup and Frightening All Its Own
","The inherent value of a good horror film is its ability to evoke primordial emotions out of its audience. In today's ever commercially consumed society, there seems to be less variety when it comes to comedy, drama, action etc. It's as if big Hollywood studios have found the perfect algorithms to keep viewers laughing, sobbing or on the edge of their seats. That said, there's still a diversity of ways movies can disturb, unsettle and frighten. One need only look at the two most acclaimed horror movies thus far this year; The Witch (2015) and The Conjuring 2 (2016) to see there's still variety. Yet while The Witch was quietly subversive, The Conjuring 2 is a happy celebration of classic horror movie tropes.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 revisits husband and wife team the Warrens (Wilson & Farmiga) as they investigate the paranormal occurrences of the Endfield House in 1970's London. The Hodgson family seems to have disturbed a former resident of the house whose spirit has taken a liking to youngest daughter Janet (Wolfe). With nowhere to turn to and the case becoming a bit of a media circus, the Warrens are resistant to help partially due to Lorraine Warren's premonition of Ed Warren's death.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 stands as a textbook example of effective horror house chills and thrills using every technique at its disposal. Everything from high-minded and meticulously created atmosphere and looming dread to low-brow jump scares are administered smartly; stabilizing some of its clichés with brilliant cinematography. Director James Wan recycles a few of the visual motifs of Insidious (2010) and the first Conjuring (2013) but let's not assume every horror movie should be groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Of course at twice the budget as the original, It'd almost feel a waste if The Conjuring 2 decided not to up the ante. Thus instead of two ghostly spirits, the film conjures three, one of which represents the manifestation of youngest son Billy's (Haigh) nightmares. It is the inclusion of this third sprite that the movie starts to lose much of the scrappy competency that made the first so memorable. That and the lack of a showstopping possession. Don't get me wrong the young Madison Wolfe does a tremendous job but Lili Taylor's performance in The Conjuring single-handedly saved the original from third act folly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, The Conjuring 2 fidgets uncomfortably under such folly, submitting a third act that is at once climactic yet technically disappointing. There are other disappointments as well; many of which stem from constantly hearkening to other, better films. There are references and visual cues to The Omen (1976), The Haunting (1963) and of course The Amityville Horror (1979) which serves less as an integral part of the story and more of a blatant case of horror movie fandom.<br/><br/>Yet for all it's faults, The Conjuring 2 still remains a decent followup to the original and a refreshingly frightening film all it's own. While it doesn't break the mold by any means, the continuation of the Warrens investigations into the paranormal feeds into a certain cultural zeitgeist that popular culture is all to willing to consume. Perhaps horror films serve another function other than to disturb, unsettle and frighten. Perhaps that also exist as an exercise in formalist filmmaking that's unfettered by irony and cynicism. In other words, perhaps some people just need something to believe in.<br/><br/>www.theyservepopcorninhell.blospot.com"
"asda-man","8","1","3","14 June 2016"," Cor, blimey guvner, a sequel worth your sixpence piece!
","I remember being pretty disappointed when The Conjuring first came out. The Internet was building it up to be one of the scariest films ever made and I was getting really excited to be properly scared. I don't usually get scared in films, but James Wan's very own Insidious did manage to conjure up (pardon the pun) some genuinely terrifying imagery so I had every right to expect the same from The Conjuring but the film didn't scare me at all. It wasn't until I re-watched it recently that I realised that whilst it isn't a scary film to me, I can appreciate it for being a very well-made horror film.<br/><br/>So when The Conjuring 2 reviews came out and were citing similar hype, I tried to put aside the claims of it being even better than the first film and went in with an open mind, almost expecting it to be a disappointment, but it wasn't. The Conjuring 2 is one of those very rare sequels (even rarer in the horror genre) which manages to better the first. It still has its problems and I still don't think it's scary or that it outdoes Insidious, but it is a fine example of haunted house horror which can stand proudly on its own.<br/><br/>You'd be forgiven for thinking that it's simply more of the same when the film starts as it's almost identical to the first film. A seemingly unrelated case opens the film and the title flashes up on the screen along with some jargon about the film being true and this case is yet again the scariest The Warrens' have ever encountered blah blah blah. It's basic scare tactics that might work for horror virgins but us aficionados will just be rolling our eyes. To be fair, the opening scene is actually very well directed and gives you some idea of the film's overall quality. <br/><br/>We're soon plunged into 1970's England and we're given constant reminders of this which is something that irritated me. Maybe it's because I'm English myself but the stereotypes were often quite overwhelming, although amusing. Every car in the driveway is a Mini Cooper, The Queen often pops up on the telly and everyone has a seriously strong cockney accent. I know that it's set in London but even so it sounds like most of the actors have moulded their accents on Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. I also found Frances O Connor a little wooden and unconvincing at times as well as a few of the kids.<br/><br/>Overall the acting is terrific though. I was particularly impressed with Madison Wolfe as Margaret, the main girl, who gave off Linda Blair vibes at times. The role asks a lot of such a young actress but she tackles it head on and it's pretty extraordinary to watch. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are also as excellent as ever as our favourite paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. I really liked how the film focused so much on their relationship so that it became the emotional core of the film. Similarly, Wan takes his time to carefully build the characters in England so that we become invested in them and actually care about what's going to happen to them. It's such a rarity these days to find a horror film with characters you feel involved with and this is the main aspect which makes The Conjuring 2 so strong and compelling.<br/><br/>The other great thing about the film is its atmosphere. James Wan clearly has a deep love for the horror genre and The Conjuring 2 is a labour of this love. The whole film is deliciously Gothic and over-the-top, it's a horror fan's dream come true. There are a lot of spooky scenes crammed into the film and whilst they didn't particularly scare me, you can't help but appreciate the stylishness and effectiveness of them. James Wan really is a master behind the camera and knows how to create genuine tension. Like the first film, a lot of scenes are filmed skilfully in one fluid take and it often becomes very intense, especially combined with the striking loud score and sound design.<br/><br/>Even the typical horror clichés like possession and creaky doors are done in such an effective way that you don't care that you've seen it a hundred times before. With a running time of over two hours, I was still left feeling eager for more. The Conjuring 2 creates a gorgeous world of horror and allows you to sink within it. It will leave horror fans consistently grinning from ear to ear. The demon/ghost designs in this one are also much more creative than the first film. The nun character (played by the same lady who acted as the iconic bum in Mulholland Dr) was memorably creepy and a bizarre character known as the crooked man is weirdly delightful, although some might find him a jarringly out of place.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the horror genre then I can't really see any reason for disliking The Conjuring 2, and if you're not a horror fan then what are you bloody doing watching a horror film? Recent films like The Witch, It Follows and The Babadook may be better but that doesn't make The Conjuring 2 obsolete. It's a beautifully crafted piece of supernatural horror which delivers atmosphere and suspense in spades. Some of it does feel a little contrived towards the end but the finale's so excitingly pulse-pounding and intense that you're unlikely to care. It makes sure that the audience actually care about the people on screen so it's never dull for one moment. A third film will definitely be on the cards and if it carries on being as solid as this one then we might be looking at the best supernatural horror franchise since... Well, ever.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at www.moviesplusmadness.wordpress.com"

The conjuring 2 is absolutely brilliant its a great take on another real life case and with plenty of other real stories this film franchise could continue to be a success. The story of the investigators Lorraine and ed warren who are sent to England by the church to help a single mom of 4 with a demonic presence in their house, the story and script is so well written and you can tell a lot of thoughts went into it.

","Generally i'm not a fan of 'horror' but I watched (and enjoyed) The Conjuring and then felt compelled to go and see the sequel The Conjuring 2.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 has a decent plot, telling a good 'ghost story'.<br/><br/>The Warrens have been investigating spooky things in the US. They decide to take a break from this, as Mrs Warren (a clairvoyant) is getting premonitions of her husbands death, via a very nasty demonic thing dressed up like a nun. (which was genuinely spooky) <br/><br/>However, on hearing the plight of a single parent family of young children in Enfield, London, being haunted by a nasty old man. The Warrens feel have to help, particularly as they are asked by 'the church' (unofficially) to go investigate. The haunting has already attracted a lot of media attention. <br/><br/>They arrive at the house and begin to find things are much worse than imagined. <br/><br/>What initially seems to be a rather nasty ghost of an old man is actually a spirit being held and controlled by a demonic being (the scary nun thing) <br/><br/>It is a fairly predictable demon/ghost story in that it has a happy ending. But how it tells the story is very good and keeps you guessing and enthralled. <br/><br/>What's too like: - <br/><br/>The films set in the 1970's but has a sort of almost 1940's dismal atmosphere at times. (this is also detrimental too a degree see further down)<br/><br/>Acting and characters are all generally good.<br/><br/>Plot is believable and logical, it builds a story with suspense rather than just making the audience jump. <br/><br/>I found the nun demon thing satisfyingly scary/ghoulish as was the old man. The child actors and 'mum' are very convincing in their terrors. <br/><br/>All in all a satisfying scary tale, where good does eventually vanquish evil nasty things. <br/><br/>Niggly things that irritated: <br/><br/>It's the 1970's, electricity has been invented for some time, kids in particular, will turn on the lights instead of walking around in the dark in the wee hours.<br/><br/>Maurice Grosse ! Looked ludicrous and I kept expecting him to be a comedy character (but wasn't)<br/><br/>Running time of 2hrs 14mins perhaps a bit long winded at times. <br/><br/>Mixed up era.! A council house that so flooded in the cellar it has a lake ? So much flooding and rickety structure, the whole house should be condemned!!!! It's a 1970s council house i.e. at that time, a relatively new property. Council's also maintain their properties so would not allow such decay/damage. It's not a 1930's ghetto. <br/><br/>At times the English 'cockney' accents did sound similar to 'Dick Van Dyke' in Mary Poppins. <br/><br/>These are relatively minor complaints. Well worth a watch 8/10<br/><br/>!"

Wilson delivers another great performance as the matter of fact Ed. Incidentally as well as being a handy man, he also does a good acoustic rendition of Elvis' ""Can't Help Falling in Love"". The notable German actress Franka Potente also appears as a sceptic but gets very little screen time. Simon McBurney is solid and almost equals Timothy Spall's performance as Maurice Grosse. Like its predecessor it shares much with other haunting films but it stands on its own due to Wan's execution, he knows horror, the eeriness, atmosphere, timing of visuals and sound to get hairs standing on end effortlessly. Something which the rushed Annabelle (2014) arguably lacked in his absence as director.<br/><br/>With a pause for thought, like true crime murders, it gets under your skin and you can't help feel that someone is profiting from someone else's misery. Conscious aside, true or not, Wan stays close to the Enfield Haunting's beats with plenty of artistic licence to inject enough practical and CGI effects without it losing its grounded feel too much in the first three quarters.<br/><br/>From wall posters to wallpapers, clothes and cars the 1977 is recreated almost perfectly. There is a set up with a remote control, although I don't recall there being remotes like that in Great Britain, or at least the family surely wouldn't have been able to afford that TV, in any case, the set up is still effectively creepy with a great jump scare when the young girl encounters an old man in both a reflection and face to face. As well as a scary zoetrope toy and fire engine, there's a horrific moment where the girls young brother is tricked into thinking a ghoul is a dog wanting to go out by ringing a bell next to the door.<br/><br/>The UK terraced neighbour setting sets it apart, but naturally its reminiscent of the three part The Enfield Haunting (2015) and When the Lights Went Out (2012) which told the 1974 Black Monk of Pontefract story. Nevertheless, Wan to his credit recreates the Brit 70s injecting some nostalgia for the viewer, with the location, The Jam, TV clips of the day and so on. Wan packs the Conjuring 2 with energy, jumps scares and handles the emotional scenes delicately. In the closing act there's a twist as it tries to hone The Exorcist. While it may not have the grit and weight of the aforementioned, it has an entertaining mix of drama and horror to set it apart from many others. As Ed and Lorraine do battle at the end, Ed stops the young girl falling to her death as Lorraine word duels with the demon (akin to the design of 2005's The Nun/La Monja), yes there's an unnecessary wash of practical and computer imagery in the finale but it comes back to earth with an eerie text epilogue, then the couple add the zoetrope toy to their collection which is followed by the leads bursting with chesmisty dancing happily together.<br/><br/>With Ouija boards, spooky nuns, spectres, toys, moving furniture, ghosts, demonic voices and so on you can't go wrong. Excellent mainstream horror entertainment."
"Pumpkin_Man","8","1","3","13 June 2016"," Very Creepy and Just as Good as the Original Conjuring!!!
","A lot of people have said this sequel is better and scarier than the original. Personally, I think it's just as equally creepy. I think James Wan is a great horror director. He knows how to get the job done and actually scare me. (Dead Silence actually scared me when I saw it at the theater) The Conjuring movies are period films and take place in the 1970's. I love that it naturally looks like the 70's and not fake like Tim Burton's Dark Shadows. This film features the Amityville Horror house in the beginning, then the majority of it is about the Enfield Poltergeist in London, England. <br/><br/>In 1977, the Hodgson family begin to experience demonic and supernatural occurrences in their house, mostly at night time. The spirit haunting them seems to be Bill Wilkins, the previous owner who died in the living room. The youngest daughter, Janet becomes possessed and keeps telling the family to get out. Ed and Lorraine Warren are called to the scene to observe and report only. Will they find that the house is truly haunted, or is it actually all a hoax? If you love ghosts, and demonic possession, I highly recommend THE CONJURING 2!!!"

","The Conjuring 2 (2016): Dir: James Wan / Cast: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Lauren Esposito: It is rare and refreshing to see horror films that contain a strong sense of good over evil but The Conjuring did it and its sequel, although not as strong, still pulls it off. It opens with an interesting reference to The Amityville Horror before Ed and Lorraine Warren are off to help a single mother and her three children deal with supernatural occurrences in their home. Vera Farmiga as Lorraine fears images of her husband's death and prefers to distance herself from her craft. Patrick Wilson as Ed supports his wife's decision but feels that their abilities are needed, and when they are summoned to assist this family he is well aware of his wife's premonition. Frances O'Connor plays the frustrated mother who learns quickly that strange horrific things are happening. Her youngest daughter is often sleepwalking and ending up in a chair that holds a dire history. The oldest daughter awakens to the bed shaking as with The Exorcist. Her son is troubled with the tent he has set up at the end of the hall that homes a demonic presence. Director James Wan surpasses his Saw franchise as well as Insidious with this effective franchise that presents Christianity in a positive meaningful manner that doesn't push the boundaries. It also presents a heart felt relationship between Ed and Lorraine that is highlighted with an Elvis Presley hit. With special effects that equal the original in its ghostly effects this becomes an entertaining horror film that promises a light at the end of a dark gloomy tunnel. Score: 7 / 10"
"agradeep006","7","1","3","13 June 2016"," The Movie Serves Its Purpose
","I don't scare easy but the Conjuring series manages to do that :D.<br/><br/>This movie is way better than the first one (Conjuring 1 was good too).<br/><br/>I was watching this movie at home all alone, I always turn down lights when watching movies. The nun demon scared me to such an extent that I had to get up and turn on the lights of my room and the adjacent room as well lol.<br/><br/>Actors are good, well I love Vera Farmiga in all sort of characters.<br/><br/>I feel very uneasy around nuns and clowns normally and when they showed the Demon Nun I was like OMG!!! Believe me that's super scary.<br/><br/>The set, direction and the storyline is good. However I felt that the closing of the movie i.e the way Warren's fight and contains the demon could have been longer and more elaborate. Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren reveals the name of the nun demon and condemns her to hell and that's it.<br/><br/>So my verdict is go watch the movie, I bet it will not disappoint you."
"David_Habert","8","1","3","13 June 2016"," Impressive sequel, Not all paranormal cases are from the USA
","When I saw the original movie the Conjuring I was extremely impressed.<br/><br/>I have studied many cases dealing with the paranormal and I'm very familiar with Ed and Lorraine Warren, also the cases they were involved in, or so I thought.<br/><br/>When I heard that there was going to be a sequel, I had a pretty good idea what the second one would be about, as a clue was left in the first movie when Lorraine said that a priest needed help for a case in Long Island, New York. That case turned out to be Amityville.<br/><br/>When I found out that this movie would be about the Enfield Poltergeist case in London, England. I spent a great deal of time scratching my head thinking The Warrens never investigated or were involved in that case.<br/><br/>It turned out that they were involved in the Enfield case, but not to the extent that you would see in Conjuring 2. They did visit the house, but were only there briefly. One of the original investigators (who strangely enough wasn't even in this movie) said that Warrens showed up uninvited.<br/><br/>Because I know about the Enfield case, I noticed there was some bits in the movie which is not correct.<br/><br/>1) One of the investigators who wrote the book which talks about the Enfield Poltergeist case isn't even in the movie Guy Lyon Playfair. He should've been. (If your interested, the name of the book is called ""This house is haunted"" and it's worth reading, believe me)<br/><br/>2) In the movie, Ed Warren filled Janet Hodgson mouth with water to see if the voice could still speak. That did happen, but it was Maurice Grosse that did that and put tape on Janet's mouth so she couldn't spit out the water, but the voice still spoke.<br/><br/>3) There is a scene where Janet was floating about in midair, Now this did happen. However what wasn't shown in the movie is that two independent witnesses also saw this happen outside the house. It's a shame this wasn't added because it would have added more credibility to the movie sticking to the facts of what actually happened during that incident.<br/><br/>To give you a more accurate idea of what was happening during this case is to watch The Enfield Haunting or some of the YouTube videos of what was going on around the 1970s and even some of the documentaries about it,because it would give you a better idea of what actually happened.<br/><br/>Apart from the errors, it was a brilliant sequel which had a lot more jump moments than in the original and also a lot longer than the original. I personally have a lot of respect for the witnesses and the investigators which include Ed and Loraine in the actual case.<br/><br/>If your looking for a great horror sequel this year, look no further. But if your interested in watching a movie adaption of the actual Enfield Poltergeist case. This isn't it, but still makes for great viewing anyway.<br/><br/>James Wan and the cast did a fantastic job to bring one of the most well documented cases which happened in the UK and not the USA to the big screen. As I said in my Summary, Not all paranormal cases are from the US. This one came from the UK and there are a few more others as well also from the UK.<br/><br/>Happy viewing folks, try not to get scared."
"prth_gswm","10","1","3","12 June 2016"," Better, scarier and more engaging than the original. The best horror movie of the decade
","I have been a huge fan of James Wan ever since Dead silence. I didn't like saw franchise though. I am not a huge fan of Insidious series either because Insidious 2 and 3 disappointed me big time.I have liked The Conjuring it was like a breath of a fresh air for Horror genre. So i had decided to watch the Conjuring 2 not just because of its name but for the director James Wan.As we all know that form is temporary but class is permanent and James Wan has proved yet again that he is a class.To create a masterpiece horror movie like The Conjuring 2 that too after making a action movie like fast and furious 7 shows your class.The story revolves around Lorraine and Ed Warren who travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirit of Bill Willkins who died in a chair due to brain haemorrhage. Lorraine has her own fear and premonition of a demonic nun who threatened to kill her husband Ed in real life.Can she stop her from killing Ed? this is what The conjuring 2 is all about. Truly speaking The Conjuring 2 is scary as hell. There is hardly any movie that made me jump over the seats. The Conjuring 2 has succeeded in doing this.Now a days when we see any trailer of a horror movie 90 percent of the scary scenes of the movie are being revealed in it but James wan is a very clever customer he kept 90% of the scary scenes in the shelves which has not been revealed in any of its trailer you can only see it in the movie.Two scenes that made me jump over the seats were when Lorraine decides to check in the painting room and a demonic nun comes out from nowhere from the painting and a scene when Janet watches TV and figure out a person sitting on a chair behind her and the remote control falls by itself.Those two scenes are the scariest scenes Hollywood has ever witnessed.The conjuring 2 is a sequel that is better and scarier than the original.The Conjuring 2 is engaging and scary from start to finish,The movie and demonic nun creature will be remembered for a long long time.I loved everything about this movie. Being a horror buff you can't afford to miss this flick at any cost.Now I am eagerly waiting for The Conjuring 3.Kudos to James wan for making The Conjuring 2 and creating a creature like demonic Nun. A cinematic masterpiece."
"Quinoa1984","8","1","3","12 June 2016"," The Conjuring 2 builds up and up and gets you in its grip, which is what the best horror can hope to do.
","James Wan is a big fan of horror. It's not always a surefire thing when a creator is someone who is so connected with a form of entertainment (see also from this opening weekend Jones's Warcraft), but if a filmmaker is in tune with the material he's in love with and it works on all cylinders, there's few pleasures to match it in mainstream cinema. This is a major release (done on a ""medium"" budget of 40 million) and it's done by someone who's clearly a geek for 70's horror, but in a way that is... classy. And scary as all hell; it's not often to use the almost DVD-cover level critic line but, really, The Conjuring 2, if you're open to it, will scare the s*** out of you.<br/><br/>Wan's become so saavy with how to deal out suspense, and it comes down to how he paces things. This isn't a short movie, and it's longer than a lot of other movies of its genre at 134 minutes. This is to the film's benefit, as it gives a lot of time to build up the characterizations; Wan gives us the two narratives of this family in England, on poverty row basically, and how the 11 year old girl is traumatized repeatedly by this undead entity named Bill and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga's) own visions of a demon in a nun's outfit going after her and killing Ed (!) (this in part attached to that little known case in Amityville, NY). We get so much time with the both sides that by the time the Warren's come to England the movie's halfway in, and it's time to get to the meat of the story.<br/><br/>A lot of what impresses me with The Conjuring 2 isn't so much the elements that we're familiar with by now when it comes to demonic-Christian-drenched horror: we know that the people will come in to the house with the crosses out to get the ghosts or demons or whatever-you-remember-from-The-Exorcist out, and that there will be characters flailing about in the air and objects flying across rooms and terrified characters. What matters is execution, and Wan and his cinematographer and production designer (this IS the 70's!) makes everything palpable and pop. When a little girl is hiding under the covers and Wan switches to a POV of the demonic entity coming in to the bedroom and towards her bed, it feels terrifying because of how all of the shots are paced and cut together and how much we believe this young actress (Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, outstanding especially in the quieter moments like on the swing with Lorraine when they meet).<br/><br/>It's a terrifying trip into the darker recesses of the human soul, and it also comes down to how Wan makes sure to depict the people and places with a degree of honesty in the drama that is outside of the junk/baby food modern horror audiences are used to. It might be a lot sometimes to ask for quality acting, or a budget higher than 5 million, but it does make a difference, and here Wan takes his time with them and it's clear they had preparation before they stepped into a story that involves family and love at the core. I liked that part of it too, that it emphasizes the bond of a family, or a married couple, in the face of evil and demons and the afterlife. So while it deals in tropes of the genre - the audio recordings that reveal more than we first heard, the ""trick"" video footage, the otherworldly inner ""voice"" taking over a character (in a real, deeply troubling psychological sense than just the surface one too) - it doesn't cheapen what's happening to them.<br/><br/>I felt invested in this family, which also features a compelling performance by Frances O'Connor as the mother of the family, and it pays off in set piece after set piece, paced out with wonderful bits for character development (including an acoustic Elvis performance by Patrick Wilson!), so that by the time the gigantic, thunderstorm climax comes we can still rock with the over-the-top punches that, of course, didn't happen in the ""based on a true story"". And yes, the climax is a little too long and features a CGI character that goes too far. But I can forgive these flaws because of the other 2 hours that came before it, which comes close to the likes of The Babadook and It Follows and even The Witch as far as digging deep into what makes people tic and drawing out the atmosphere of things like a room or a hallway or a flooded basement, and getting terror by simply holding on a shot sometimes for long enough for it to take on another meaning (i.e. Ed talking to ""Bill"", back turned, in close-up with the ghost out of focus but still in sight)."
"gercs","7","1","3","12 June 2016"," Still creepy and scary, and remarkably, a decent follow-up to the first one
","Watching the first ""Conjuring"" movie on DVD was driven by the motivation to scare a friend, who is known to be entertainingly frightened. I am not a fun of horror movies because of their usual shallow story-lines and cheap tricks. Plus, the hype that surrounds them annoys me since a lot of them are just plain cash-making machines, e.g. ""The Blair Witch Project"". So I was surprised that ""The Conjuring"" movie has this interesting story-line and lingering creepiness, which was achieved without relying much on visual effects. Indeed, ""old-school"" darkness and shadows are scarier than trying-hard CGI monsters. And after the movie, we ended up scaring each other with that brilliant ""clap scene"". So I think this time, it's not bad after all to watch the sequel, ""The Conjuring 2"", in a movie theater (given that we have the same director, and of course, the same people who portrayed the Warrens).<br/><br/>The second movie started with the controversial Amityville Horror case, in which the Warrens were also involved (their most widely known case). In these kind of supernatural cases, people are divided between those who considered the case a hoax and those who believed it to be true, aside from being don't care or neutral. In this case, the film takes the side of the Warrens who considered that something demonic was behind the killings. In our case, as an audience, we are more on the neutral side, just plain listeners to one side of the investigation while seeking entertainment value; somewhat akin to watching a cultural film and being immersed with the cultural point of view in question.<br/><br/>For the Warrens, it seems that the Amityville Horror case has greatly affected them, especially Lorraine, who saw premonitions of her husband's death. Then, after that, the film moved to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, where something paranormal is happening in a public housing unit in London. This is where the film developed the Hodgson family (and it did well enough to make us care about their struggles). This is set in the late 1970's, and remarkably the production values are high because the setting really looked like we are really in the 1970's (and they showed photographs when the end credits rolled) and the camera work is successful most of the time to create tension and suspense. However, what's missing in this film when compared to the first one is an iconic scare scene, e.g. the ""clap scene"". We practically saw nothing new except a more stylish camera work, more masterful suspense, and a different story-line. The good thing was that most of the scares are effective enough to elicit reaction from the audience (in many occasions, I laughed at the reaction in many false alarms and unexpected scare moments, and that was fun), and the high point of the film was particularly intense (but quite short for our taste). Moreover, we get to see a good attempt at combining horror and comedy, e.g. when the Hodgsons ran away from their house after a disturbing poltergeist activity. James Wan, indeed, improved in his skills as a director, although not much in mixing sentimentality (but I think that Elvis Presley tribute as a way of cheering up the Hodgsons is OK).<br/><br/>Another good stuff is the performance of the whole cast, with the special mention of Madison Wolfe, as Janet - the main target of the poltergeist(s) for possession - and Frances O'Connor, as Peggy Hodgson - the struggling mother of four, who was at her wits end to provide for her children. Then, as usual, we got good performances from Vera Farmiga, as Lorraine Warren, and Patrick Wilson, as Ed Warren. Even though we more or less saw related scare scenes before from other movies, e.g. The Exorcist, many of the scares are still effective. However, it is during the time when it attempts to use more CGI that the film loses its effectivity, e.g. the Crooked Man scene. In contrast, we experienced more chills when a shadow was employed, e.g. the nun scene where the demonic, in a form of a nun's shadow, slowly reaches for an eerie nun portrait, and places itself behind it. It is in the ""old-school"" style where Wan's technique is most effective, and in this manner, I find the first ""Conjuring"" film to be more creepy than this one. And also, the big difference is that in the first one we don't have much idea about the villain until the climax, but in this one, we more or less have a good idea about the villain's identity and how it looked like given Lorraine's premonitions and an image from one of Ed's dreams. And finally, we find a haunted farmhouse, with centuries-old tale and more ominous villain, to be more creepy than a suburban tale with a less compelling villain background story. However, given the suburban setting, the feat is remarkable, and we had fun watching it."
"ctowyi","7","1","3","12 June 2016"," Not as good as the first but way better than a lot of horror films out there
","One can literally count on the fingers on one hand the great horror films that are intelligent and yet not derivative. James Wan has honed his arsenal of horror aesthetics through the years and he reached his most potent level with The Conjuring in 2013. One of the reasons Wan succeeds so well in this genre is that he knows the audience - when to tighten the piano wire noose and when to let you take in a breath. The scares are simple yet elegant, and damn well effective. It is a tough act to follow. A little personal story first...<br/><br/>I am an avid reader, a habit that began when my mom gave me a few Enid Blyton books when I was in P3. But the moment I hit Sec 1 I told myself I need to start reading adult fiction. I remember going to Times at Lucky Plaza, a short walk from my school, and picking out a book to start on my next reading journey. I picked up Jay Anson's The Amityville Horror; I figured by reading this genre it meant I am all grownup. It scared the living daylights out of me. To think that all the stuff actually happened really put the fear of God in me. The Conjuring ended with Ed and Lorraine being called to the Amityville haunting and that is where The Conjuring 2 begins. <br/><br/>There is no need for any synopsis because the sequel adheres to its predecessor in form and structure. It is yet another haunted house, this time from across the pond in London. A nice family is being tormented; nightly shenanigans ensue; all levels of hell break loose. An air of familiarity breeds - a little girl possessed, speaking in a husky menacing voice, uncanny levitation - all too familiar. If you have seen the demon possession film The Exorcist, you have seen them all. That isn't a slight against it; merely an observation. As much as Wan can scare us, it is the quiet passages that he also excels in. We understand the pains of the tortured family and the relationship between demonologist and clairvoyant, Ed and Lorraine Warren respectively. Vera Farmiga's Lorraine's tender exterior holds a steadfast sense of justice at bay. Her warm performance counter-balances a Patrick Wilson's Ed who is headstrong in his fight with the demonic monstrosity. Their screen chemistry feels natural and lived-in. It is precisely because Wan makes us fall in love with the characters first that the horror of what happens to them become emotionally unbearable. <br/><br/>IMHO where it fumbles for me is the familiarity of the narrative. I see the usual scares coming and none of them resembles the original in terms of elegance and simplicity. I am also of the opinion that great horror movies do not rely a lot on CGI (take a good look at the good ones in the past few years - It Follows, The Babadook and The Witch). The moment I see CGI-ed ghosts my mind starts to tune off (here's looking at you, Crimson Peak). I am also of the opinion that great horror movies don't have a runtime of over 2 hours. My wife would say ""chop chop curry pok"" and get it done fast and furious. The Conjuring 2 could have used a faster pace to get to the meat. <br/><br/>Still, this is a solid piece of horror filmmaking culminating in a full-blown final act of symphonic terror in which so much is at stake. I would definitely welcome a third part but James Wan needs to choose the next case from the Warrens' files wisely."
"anupapu8","9","1","3","10 June 2016"," An Improved Sequel To A Very Good Movie
","THE CONJURING 2 - I would like to start my review by stating the fact that , this is not at all a usual horror movie we watch every 2nd month of the year full of cliché , usual scares and where every story seems to be same as other. Rather its a HORROR - DRAMA. I mean the horror part of the movie is as much as important as the drama part is. Its not always about the ghost , sometimes its about the love , trust and friendship of a couple , sometimes its about sticking together with your family in hard times and sometimes its about your faith , to believe more than you see. First of all its a really good improvement on a very good movie THE CONJURING. But i would like to say about a couple of things i don't like - Obviously its about spirits and ghosts , so we cant always find logic in the activities of those spirits and ghosts , i mean who knows whatever ghost do why exactly they do. There is not always a reasoning to it. Still i am not exactly convinced with the objective of the ghost in this movie. Let just leave this point here as to elaborate it i have to discuss the story which i don't want to do. The 2nd thing is that - Why exactly a ghost tell his name to a person if he knows that by the name that human can control him. Again to understand what m trying to say , you have to watch the film . Apart from these two thing there are mostly good things in the movie which i m gonna discuss now. James Wan is currently the best horror movie director working in Hollywood. He is also directing the upcoming AQUAMAN in the DC UNIVERSE. And i was a little bit scared about this fact , but after watching conjuring 2 i am totally convinced that he can make a great superhero movie too. I have seen all of his movies , SAW was nice for the genre , DEAD SILENCE was his worst , DEATH sentence was pretty nice , Insidious was better then just good , CONJURING was very good , INSIDIOUS 2 was better then the first Part and then FURIOUS 7 which i guess the whole world liked. Its great to watch how he developed as a director. And m so glade that he decided to give importance to the drama as much as the horror part. Its a long movie , about 2hrs and 15mins , which is way higher then the usual horror movie of one and a half hour. Because as i said its not about the ghost always. Yes it ask for a little patience , but it gets paid off , at least for a movie lover like me who don't need everything in hurry and can give time and chance to the movie to get you dissolve in it. A question can be were there enough horror scenes. I would say yes there are. A lot of . Yes it depends on the amount of horror you consume within yourself , i mean how much a ghost can make you scare. I personally got one JUMP OF ON YOUR SEAT SCENE as well as my friend. But two girls sitting just next to my seat had seen the whole movie with holding each other out of fear. You can judge a lot from that. <br/><br/>Another thing what the movie did different that , it is set up in ENGLAND and not America. Which made it a different experience. Let me warn you , if you are watching this in English pleas watch it in a theater which provides subtitle , otherwise it would be difficult to understand the British Accent.<br/><br/>The people of England behave in a very different way as compared to Americans. They have more humor and are gentle in behaving. There is a very good comic scene in the movie where two police officers see the chair moving by itself and came out of the house saying they cant help as this thing is beyond them. That particular scene couldn't have been possible if the movie has been set in America because in America the police officers are much more serious in their behavior. And that scene was not the only light moment in the movie. The movie was full of such scenes.<br/><br/>Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson as Warren HUSBAND - WIFE are great again. They trust each other and work great as a team. They also care very much for each other as they know what they do is a life threatening task. There was a scene where Patrick Wilson sing a song for the Haunted Family to make the situation light for the time being , and at that moment the way Vera looked at her singing husband , her expression shows that how much lucky she feels herself to find ED as his husband. That particular scene is a proof that JAMES WAN can even direct a romantic film.<br/><br/>The British Cast was great too. The Girl who played JANET (the possessed girl) and the boy who played his sweet brother BILLY were the best. Cinematography was really good , and the period setting was great. Also the music director has done a nice job. Its a great horror movie about a ghost , but also a sweet movie about a sweet family and also a soothing movie about a lovely couple who like to help others by using the extraordinary power they have. M very selective when it comes to a horror film. But now Conjuring series is among my favorite ones , along with Ring series , Insidious series , Oculus , Exorcist and It FOLLOWS. 8.2/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR.."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","7","1","3","9 June 2016"," As good as the original, and maybe better.
","Pretty good, but awfully familiar, not to mention long, hybrid of The Exorcist, and The Amityville Horror, about paranormal investigators trying to unravel the mystery of a Marilyn Manson- lookalike haunting in London at Christmas 1977, which gave the film a wonderful and unique setting, possibly its strongest asset. <br/><br/>The film has an effectively creepy atmosphere, good visuals, and works best when creating a sense of dread and fear, but too often it will sink to relying on cheap jump scares (most of which are shown in the trailer)<br/><br/>The acting is top notch all around, especially the young kids, which makes it as good as, if not better than, the original, which is no small feat, especially in the horror genre. An interesting and unusual twist occurs three quarters of the way in, when ""proof"" is found of the young girl faking the entire ordeal, for the publicity and fame it could bring her family. <br/><br/>But for all those things working in its favour, it can't distract me from noticing an overwhelming feeling of deja vu."
"eddiemondragon","8","1","3","9 June 2016"," The way horror sequels should be made! Just as good as the original!
","If you liked the first one, this one does a good job at hitting the scare meter heights as its predecessor did. Some scenes are pretty full on. James Wann has once again done a great job at creating a lot of tense scenes, specially through the use of some pretty good camera work. Although it's a bit long for a horror film, which is my main criticism...it still manages to keep the audience on edge right till the end. As we left the cinema, judging by the audience's reaction, it will be a movie that will be received by horror fans. Might not be for everyone, but if you're a fan of the horror genre, and considering the it is a genre that is slowly dying unfortunately...The Conjuring 2 definitely stands up high (with the original) above the rest. 4/5 stars."
"tonmoytitus123","5","2","11","11 June 2016"," Huge anticipation,dismal outcome.
","What james wan has done for horror films through his directions is that he has somewhat managed to bring the shock factor or rather the jump scares to good use,even though they have been played out since forever ,but that said ,however The conjuring was in absolute total contradiction of horror tactics altogether. The eerie setting and the background score and the fabulous performances made the move a glorious return of the horror genre with respect from both critics and viewers alike. That said,not only does the conjuring 2 looses it's phenomenal status as an anticipated squeal to the most celebrated horror film of the recent era but it brings clichéd horror tactics back to the screen once again leading to nothing but some very little scare.<br/><br/>Mediocre jump scares,unnecessary CGI and okay performances brings the end to what could have been a glorified franchise.I am not disappointed on james wan direction,he does what he does best,the cinematography,the set design everything is apt but it just does not pan out as you want it to be.Another major disappointment for me was Joseph Bishara's rather dull background score. All in all,I had anticipated this movie for a real long time and the past week was the most difficult as I just knew this was going to be a bigger masterpiece unlike it's predecessor and I just could not wait to watch it but alas,it just was a dreadful experience. Absolutely disheartened."
"sheldonnylander","6","1","4","25 August 2019"," Based on the true story as told by charlatans
","I'm giving this one more star than I gave the first movie. As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background ""monster"" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.<br/><br/>Again, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story. Take it with a massive grain of salt."

","THE CONJURING 2 is a follow up to the surprise haunted house hit and another outing for psychic investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, as played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. Sadly, I'm no fan of these films, finding the direction overblown and the reliance on cliches and pedestrian plotting to be completely off-putting. This unconvincing sequel transports the action to England, where the investigators are shoehorned into the famous Enfield Poltergeist case. They end up bringing their old baggage with them, so this is more about evil nuns and stupid spirits than any attempts at realism. The over-the-top fantasy hauntings involving Farmiga's character never gel with the icy chills of the poltergeist case, and it's one of those Hollywood films that manages to make all of the British accents ring hollow and false. By the end, it's devolved into yet another chased-around-by-CGI climax, just like in the INSIDIOUS trilogy, and my interest had long since waned."

The actors did a very great job, they really fit in to their roles.

"abouhelier-r","10","1","4","2 July 2016"," How James Wan is Rewriting the Book of Horror
","Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to North London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a malicious spirit. <br/><br/>The brilliantly terrifying The Conjuring is the second highest grossing horror movie of all time. The first being: The Exorcist. This film was genuinely the best horror film I had ever seen in a long time and James Wan is in my point of view, the best director working in horror today; so I was really excited to see this second instalment. This movie makes a perfect follow-up to the original Conjuring's lesser known case. Plus, the movie starts with a certain Amityville House. Yes, THAT Amityville. Here, the Enfield Case is probably one of the best documented, most studied and most contested hauntings in existence and in British history. The real recordings of paranormal investigator Ed Warren interviewing the entity through Janet live at the end of The Conjuring 2 and it's difficult not to let chills run down your spine. Nonetheless, director James Wan offers its potential fans a helping of reinsurance to go along with the fear. If there are ghosts and demons out there, then God must be out there as well. James Wan, who directed Saw and Insidious, is a horror filmmaker of such skills that even when he makes a by-the-book haunted-house story, it's easy to feel a hint of admiration for his talent beneath your tingling spine. <br/><br/>Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson couple really ground the film in realism as their backstory and relationship are really touching and heartfelt. Being more than a horror movie, it's about marriage and being with somebody that understands you. The realistic family story grounds the film and makes it better than your average horror film. <br/><br/>Horror lives in the unknown. It hides in abandoned asylums, in catacombs, in cabins and haunted manors. These are safe places to die. You don't want to die? Maybe don't do an Ouija Board, stay home and watch Netflix instead. Nothing can find you there. Except James Wan. Wan is a modern horror maestro who brings the fear home to you. All these events take place in the very real world, occupied by everyday people trying to get on with their life. We've all been children hiding under the duvet from whatever hid under our bed in the dark. Even now, home alone on a rainy day, we've sat on our couch and wondered what creaked the floorboards in the seemingly empty room next to us. Wan's fear construction is effortless, his best moments lie in the silence between scares. <br/><br/>He also has a sense of the audience: of their rhythm and pulse, of how to manipulate a moment so that he's practically controlling your breathing. He became a master of THE face. He must have a card in his office reading:""All you need to make a hit horror film is one truly awful face!"". THAT face. The face that's staring through the window. Staring through the dark. The face that's coming to get you eventually. James Wan again proves with this film that he knows how to use a jump scare. Those are meant to get you. This man knows how to built tension until it feels insurmountable. He's also a wizard of timing, i-e he toys with us by throwing so routinely unsettling images at us, like, let's say a toy firetruck that starts to move ion its own. Then, letting that omen menace pass at which point the movie will simply pause, stopping dead in its tracks. It's right there, in the middle of that storm of quiet, that our anxiety starts to rush in. Finally, it's truly the craft, performances and the writing that make this film a billion years ahead of all films of its kind, out right now. This film is really good. It's scary, suspenseful, the tension is real and a lot of that is due to a brilliant cinematography. <br/><br/>Overall, James Wan knows his craft. And all he has to do to bring you true horror is take you home, where you think you're safe from harm. Sweet, sweet dreams."

"tjgoalie13","8","1","4","19 June 2016"," A Genuinely Scary Sequel
","The Conjuring 2 is one of those extremely rare horror sequels that doesn't fall victim to copying it's predecessor. While The Conjuring 2 isn't free of clichés and isn't better than it's predecessor, it's a really solid horror film separate from the original. The Conjuring 2 is chilling without relying on jump scares, features really good character development, despite being a tad familiar. This film may prove that James Wan is the modern king of horror, because every horror film he does is solid.<br/><br/>One thing to learn from this film is that while jump scares are a cheap way to get scares, they can be very effective when used sparingly. Many modern horror films rely solely on jump scares to scare the audience, but this film has a truly chilling tone, and many scenes are terrifying without jumping the audience. That being said there are jump scares littered throughout this film, but Wan is clever when he uses them, and is often effective when he uses them. I'm proud that most horror films don't jump me, that being said multiple times watching this film I found myself jumped.<br/><br/>One major reason this film succeeds is because of the character development, which really helps the audience care about the characters. Every single character in the film is well fleshed out, and given a moment of relatability. Even the ghosts in the film are generally scary and have a really good design. However, the film's characters represent one of the film's major problems, the fact that it's based on true events. After seeing this film it would seem to say that the phrase ""based on true events"" was only included for dramatic effect.<br/><br/>The story of the film is based on the actual events of the Enfield Poltergeist in England in the late 70's but the problem is that half the film uses moments from that investigation and the other half feels like an exorcist rip off. It's unfortunate because there's a terrifying story, despite the evidence that it was a hoax, in the Enfield Poltergeist that gets lost in the shuffle. Simply put if the filmmakers hadn't felt the need to match The Exorcist, the film's ending may not have felt so different from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In the end for horror buffs, this may be the best horror film of the year, if nothing better comes along. For those who want to see a great horror film regardless of its faithfulness to the actual events this is a great film, but for those who want a faithful adaptation of the Enfield Poltergeist this film definitely takes some liberties. That being said this film is genuinely scary which is rare today, and above that is just a good film in general, so it's most definitely worth seeing."

"stonedraim","8","1","4","19 June 2016"," Take a breath... count to ten... see the true shadows which the academics clarifies as fiction demonization and say... MY HOUSE!
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>This is one more of Hollywoods productions where it is clear that they learn more and more about how to entertain the audience. The way that more and more movies only uses the sounds of the surroundings and the natural sound effects and keeps it quiet around, that brings a more authentic touch and a deeper presence throughout. <br/><br/>The haunting is taking place whenever, wherever and with whomever. The police is coming at night and as in other horror movie and motions pictures overall, the events and incidents suddenly stops. Here... oh no... it keeps on. The family of the Warrens is haunted at the same time as the new case comes in place; the first spiritual experience in the Warrens residence is of a nun. The police says minutes before to Peggy that the priest of the church is a friend and that the priest will call the Hodgsons. The religion and church blends together and is used as a line of argument. Wonderful! The production team has made an excellent research and at the same time a nod to the horror movies of the 70's. Where the then modern design were natural, the production team takes the same thing and push it a notch in modern daylight to give this movie a splendid design. They uses for example a girl with the 70's haircut and clothing (as is natural, of course) and puts some of the classical camera production in place just as it was in the 70's. There is some small camera movement representing the movement of the human body that is just... oh, it is so legislative and enhancing! This and a knowingly and consciously work to make the camera slidings and movements accommodative! All through this named topics; genius!<br/><br/>We may have one of the few sequels that beats the original one here. Yes.... actually, we may have that.<br/><br/>To come bock to the beginning of this review; oh, yes... there is some hefty signs and traces from Poltergeist. The TV starts to go crazy and.... MY HOUSE! There is also some nods to the production behind Poltergeist; in one scene in Poltergeist the chairs around the kitchen table is behind the scenes put up in a very fast way from one moment to another, all in one take. In Conjuring 2... also...all in one take; a chair is set in one place... the camera is rolling and the girl is acting...zooming out, the chair has been moved. <br/><br/>A whole room is shut down because it was there the activity were more than demonic.... and there is the line of argument from Poltergeist. ""The Babadook"" has taken its toll on the crew here... suddenly a presence is coming alive from a toy and children's song; as taken straight out of The Babadook. The classical of Warlock has maybe been been seen; what is the name of the demon....? It even rains and has an relationship to a book, just as in Warlock. I really appreciate the way the whole team behind this movie has gone through and in depth of ""old horror movies"" and taken some small things, some small bits and pieces here and there and made them their own. Clap, clap! (yes, pun intended to the Conjuring)<br/><br/>There is so many little story lines, incidents and events throughout that I could write for hours. An enormous twist that is within the spiritual world; Bill is himself haunted by an evil presence, making ""him"" do the things ""he"" do to the family. Later on, suddenly there is proof that the girl is faking it all; an hoax. <br/><br/>Enjoy the Elvis impersonation, the crew taking documentations and the love between the Warrens, as Mrs. Warren is scared to death (pun intended) of losing her husband.......<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and production design is top notch. I was enjoying... nay, I was feasting on the astonishment of this motion picture. ""Somebody get an ambulance!!!"" is a excellent way of going from let us say chapter 1 to chapter 2. The frozen picture, the terror in the mothers scream and the echoing is accentuating this whole process, just as in a saga. Chapter 1 is finished. Off to Chapter 2. And then chapter 3 goes off with the lyrics of ""I started a joke""; spot on! - The actors : Solid, good and realistic. Vera Farmigas scream in the beginning of the film is horror chilling and icing to the bone. The little girl (Madison Wolfe) is shaking and stirring things up here; I could feel her horror! Academy Award in the future! - The story : A house that is haunted. A well known and used story. And.... they make is work...oh, they make it work. - Entertainment : Chilled. Horrified. Scared. - Age : 15... or even 18 due to the depth of religious and spiritual level in which the evil is presented.<br/><br/>8,2 out of 10."

","I was looking forward to a actual good horror movie for quite some time now and here comes ""The Conjuring 2"". Which is actually an effective horror movie.

Plus for a horror movie the budget this time around is quite high for a horror movies. Thanks the success of the previous ""The Conjuring"" movie. Three things that make this movie work is the imagery and how they utilize the set pieces and environments to build tension. It really brings out the horror mainly because of the creepy imagery. The second, is how it goes in a quite clever direction and execution when it comes to the twist and turns. It actually makes the audiences try to think and guess certain scenarios. And the revelations was done in a quite smart manner. The third is the acting, even the child actors managed to pull it off. Which is a key factor when it comes to a movie such as this. I am a bit numb to horror movies as this stage, but there were few parts where I was actually a bit tense. Some of the audiences reactions were just priceless. The guy next to me had his whole face covered and was sliding down on his chair while saying ""this is too scary"". Usually when it comes to horror sequels it's usually not as good as the original...But good job James Wan. The evil entity I couldn't help but think of Marilyn Manson. <br/><br/>8/10"
"jay-techie2007","8","1","4","18 June 2016"," Marginally better than the predecessor but really good and presents some real good quality horror.
","Sequels often carry a burden of expectations/benchmark set by their earlier movies. The Conjuring was executed amazingly well even with the standard scary stuff and The Conjuring 2 stuck to the story flow approach of its predecessor but yet bringing in the novelty in terms of brand new location and a sub-plot. This franchisee is definitely beating Insidious hands down. <br/><br/>Story (8/10): Based on a real life incident in late 70s - a family of single- mother and four kids in North London is terrorized to hell by a supposed ghost, often possessing one of the daughters. Warrens are called all the way from US to take a look at that and report back to the church. Their search encounters series of events that eventually discover the genesis of the Hodgson family's nightmare. The climax is particularly well written with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seats. <br/><br/>Horror (6/10): I found the horror element comparatively less in this one compared to The Conjuring. Partly also because some of the scenes were too predictive as we not just seen them in the first movie but other horror movies as well. However, it doesn't seem to be a mistake as much as it seems a deliberate attempt to stick to what worked in the first part and focus more on the story telling. It is the same dilemma that super hero movies face - whether they want to focus on out-of-the-world action sequences or focus on a compelling story. <br/><br/>Acting (9/10): Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have given stellar performances here. Particularly, Patrick has made himself more noticeable in this one. Frances O'Connor (as the single mother) and Madison Wolfe (her daughter) had the most challenging roles which they executed very well. The expressions of agony, fear, anger, disgust have been nailed to perfection and is particularly remarkable. <br/><br/>Direction (8/10): James Wan has stuck pretty much to what worked in the first movie. The direction is good overall. The scenes have been conceptualized well. Especially, the climax has been directed extremely well with some unpredictable sequences. The movie could have been a bit shorter as the first half of the movie is a bit of a drag. <br/><br/>Overall (8/10): The Conjuring 2 did just marginally well compared to its predecessor. However, it would be a bit unfair to keep comparing it with the first part. Independently, the movie is really good and presents some real good quality horror."

"RLTerry1","9","1","4","17 June 2016"," Outstanding horror film!
","Director James Wan has once again provided audiences with a brilliant work of the macabre and supernatural. From the writing to the directing to the acting and cinematography, Conjuring 2 is on par with, if not better than the first. Sometimes the best stories are true ones. And, although elements of the story have to be fictionalized in order to construct a cinematic narrative, grounding the Conjuring movies in the real work of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) infuses a dynamic emotional response that directly impacts the increased frightening nature of these films. One of the observations that I appreciate most about, not only this but the predecessor, is not relying upon the jump-scare to curdle the blood. Are jump scares part of the movie? Well, of course! What fun would a horror film be without the entire theatre gasping for breath, jumping, or screaming together??? But Wan goes beyond the jump scare and channels his inner Hitchcock to build suspense and intrigue. The horror film is best appreciated in a group setting. It is a genre that specifically engages the audience on a visceral level. Wan is truly a master at his craft; and I love witnessing how he continues to prove his ability to develop creative horror films.<br/><br/>Following the increasing trend for a film, including but not limited to horror, to begin with an elaborate prologue, Conjuring 2 starts with a fantastic moving shot of the famous eyelet windows of the 112 Ocean Avenue house in Amityville. Often filmed from the outside, this shot sequence takes place inside the attic. A much more intimate feel, this was an excellent choice for establishing the case that launched Ed and Lorraine Warren into the public eye. There have been numerous movies and documentaries based on the arguably most infamous haunting in the United States, so it was not necessary for Wan to spend too much time on it. It is, however, a very important scene because the plot/case of Conjuring 2 is directly related to the experience that the Warrens went through during the Lutz investigation. Beyond the establishing a connection between the Amityville and Enfield cases, beginning with the Warrens in the middle of the 112 Ocean Avenue investigation allows for Wan to visually show how and why the Warrens would seek a self-imposed sabbatical from supernatural and demonic investigations. Moreover, this sequence of events that provides copious amounts of plot development material are also instrumental in significant contributions to character development. Although this prologue lasts less than ten minutes, it contains prolific information vital to the plot of Conjuring 2.<br/><br/>It should not be of surprise that Wan uses the camera very strategically to tell this visually driven story. From the rule of thirds to lighting to creative use of angles and movement, the camera is instrumental in setting the macabre mood of the film. One of the visual storytelling elements that Hitchcock was most known for, especially in Psycho, is using the camera's placement and angle to foreshadow something or someone. Wan takes a page from the Hitchcock handbook and utilizes the camera movement in such a way that you are predisposed to feeling certain that something or someone is about to appear or emerge from the shadows but your game is thrown off when that doesn't happen–but then totally happens when you least expect it! Throughout the diegesis, you will encounter moment when the characters are faced with inner demons that parallel or symbolize the actual evil entities in the film. Having this subplot concurrent to the foreground aids in creating and maintaining an emotional connection to the characters. Shocking the audience both emotionally and physically. By eliciting dynamic and comprehensive responses to the horror on screen, the film becomes an immersive experience–that is the brilliance behind this dark and sinister tale.<br/><br/>Beyond the exceptional direction by Wan, part of what makes the Conjuring franchise so successful is the exquisite casting. Patrick Wilson (Insidious) and Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel) are perfectly cast in these films. From what I have read about the real Ed and Lorraine Warren, Wilson and Farmiga respectively stay true to the real-life people they are portraying while adding in the necessary acting skills necessary to increase the impact and believability of the film. The quality of the acting that Wilson and Farmiga bring to the film is outstanding. Sometimes, a horror film can have an compelling plot but the actors are so uninteresting that it prohibits the story from making the impression that it should. Wilson and Farming make the characters of Ed and Lorraine Warren interesting to watch and add a performance quality to the film that keeps your attention the whole time. The degree to which they add a sincere care for the victims of hauntings to their respective characters is refreshing and will stay with yowling after the movie closes. As the Warrens are reoccurring characters in the Conjuring franchise, it is vitally important that they are as interesting to watch as the plot itself since their cases are the inspiration for the whole franchise, at least put to this point.<br/><br/>If there is one negative element in the film, it is the weak showdown. Not weak in that it was anticlimactic or uninteresting, but that it felt a little rushed. At 2hrs and 15mins, the film is longer than the average horror film, so it was not necessary to rush the climax of the film. It certainly does not mitigate the experience of the movie, but I feel that it could have been a little more intense. That being said, if you are looking for an excellent movie to kickoff your weekend, then this one is it!"

There is lots of build up to those ""really"" scary moments.<br/><br/>Is there anything to hate about this movie?: yes, there is.

","Great movie, I enjoyed this, and director James Wan (Insidious, Saw, Dead Silence) is becoming one of my favorite directors, not just in mainstream horror movies, but mainstream directors in general. I love how this film isn't just cheap jump scares, like many of today horror films. It actually builds up the tension. I thought the first Conjuring was great, and this is a good example of how to do a horror movie, and how a sequel can actually be better than the 1st in my opinion. I actually saw this movie with my dad, and he fell asleep. But, I thought it was more than entertaining, and worth staying awake. Even though I thought the crooked man ( a.k.a. James Wan auditioning for slender man) didn't need to be in the film, and this film could have been trimmed down 20 minutes. Also, the acting by Vera Farmiga (Orphan) and Patrick Wilson (Watchmen), works well, and the two work well together. Patrick Wilson's acting, wardrobe, character development, and 70's sideburns almost had me thinking it really was 1977 lol.

It's one thing to sit and conjure up strange noises and knocks and pings throughout the night and then account them as being paranormal but as soon as you get serious about what you are doing knowing all too well that what comes through could without a doubt kill you, it's then the word paranormal becomes a welcome mat compared to the actual being that is in the room with you. With that said, don't be too critical because you will come out of this experience in the movie as just a movie and nothing else. Sit back, relax while you can and savor that moment because as soon as you dive into the movie, you will be scared and you will have images burned into your mind. Don't be surprised if you get home and begin to leave the lights on because this movie is that frightful!!"

","Whoever says that this sequel is not as good as the first film is LYING. It is so common for the sequels to be far worse than the originals that it has become a habit to the viewers to judge them without even noticing them. NOT this time! <br/><br/>Conjuring 2 is not just ""not worse than the first"". It is precisely as good as the first.<br/><br/>Great story, great acting, smart dialogues, smart jump scares, dark atmosphere. Everything you need in a horror film. <br/><br/>I liked the fact that the movie makes you care for the protagonists. Also, I loved the way it keeps you interested all the way throughout it. Never bored, never relaxed, always on guard. The quality of the movie is A+. James Wan's magic wand has done its miracle once more. <br/><br/>The trap of relying on the first movie's success has been avoided and that is because of Wan's love and dedication to his work. <br/><br/>It's about time that we become less harsh on good horror films and stop judging them for being what they are. They are horror films and we should judge them as that exactly. If i wanted to watch ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Cane"" I wouldn't be watching a horror film. STOP COMPARING HORROR FILMS WITH DRAMAS. <br/><br/>On the other hand, even with this type of judgment, this movie deserves a 9/10 BECAUSE IT'S A DAMN GOOD MOVIE. <br/><br/>Congratulations James Wan! You've done it again!"

","Dear Team, That was the most horror film of the year 2016 till date.The film was more a strong chemistry between Loraine and Ed Warren. I must say that Patrick Wilson once again wins over the show with his splendid performance. Besides, Peggy was also good in body language. I just could not get the point how Ed at the seeing the cross of reels in the bus got the sense that the spirit in that house was inhuman ?? And what was the reason of listening to the two audio reels ? The adventurous thing was the performance of small kid Janet that really shocked in some scenes. The film, however, was not more horror than its prequel but it was a treat to watch due to excellent performances of all cast most especially Ed and Loraine."
"ArisMichael","10","1","4","15 June 2016"," Horror genre lived up to its name
","I am pleasantly surprised by the current rating of the movie. I honestly believe it is worth it. Personally, I gave it a 10, because I want to encourage other studios to scrutinize and study this film, in order to prevent themselves from making unworthy movies.<br/><br/>The plot itself is not the most original piece out there, but it features great atmosphere, a couple of laughs here and there, an unexpected exorcism and a haunting (literally) presence.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the horror genre. It has been quite disappointing to see studios being utterly insensitive to change and to always toy around with the same concept: a remote house with a dark past and a family tortured by an entity.<br/><br/>What I like in Conjuring is that seemingly third-person actors become the protagonists. It is not only about the family's suffering anymore. They are represented as the saviors, spreading their glimmer of hope. The second installment did not fail my expectations. Several jump scares and a fey presence which you can carry with you in your memory. A few movies have managed to accomplish that, especially to a fan of the genre, like myself. To date, it was the Grudge, the Ring, Drag me to Hell's gypsy woman and Dead Silence's Mary Shaw. I do admit, however, that the resemblance of the ghost to Marilyn Manson was uncanny. That is not to say that the ghost does not remain scary. Its portrayal is complemented with an assertive look, symmetrically outlined from the nun's outfit. For those who have watched the movie, they will know that I am currently misusing the ""ghost"" word, but I do not wish to spoil anything.<br/><br/>Additionally, I really liked the addition of a twist; it did not ruin the pace of the plot nor did it bring any confusion. Rather, it was a twist that motivated certain actions. I will use one word to explain this, again, primarily directed to the ones who have watched it: pawn.<br/><br/>One thing I disliked was two scenes with CGI, the exorcism and the Crooked Man. The crooked man was an unnecessary addition - it would have been better if the actual entity was used instead. Plus, the artistic look was quite poor and I could occasionally discern motion capture exaggerations - this might probably come from the fact that I develop video games and have thus been exposed to lots of CGI, animations, and special effects.<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable horror film and with a worthy placement in my list of recommendations. I do wish the same entity is reused somehow in upcoming installments - it appeared too powerful to be cast away like that. Plus, it was very well made, so it would be a waste if it does not get recycled at some point."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","4","15 June 2016"," ""There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile....""
","James Wan is the best horror director working today. The man knows the genre so well that he can easily manipulate the atmosphere to terrorize the viewer. Such a masterful sense of control that he can easily control your fear. With this sequel, Wan has created 3 very successful and engaging horror series. <br/><br/>Paranormal Investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren are called to England to investigate whether or not the Enfield family are plagued by deadly spirits or if the family is lying and the whole thing is a hoax. We as the viewer know the truth, we are with this family when the strange occurrences start happening. Yet Wan cleverly depicts such things in a shroud of mystery when the Warren's arrive to make them question if what is happening is real or not. Should they leave thinking it's fake, the terror we feel for the family will be even greater. <br/><br/>I believe The Conjuring to be one of the best horror films of the last decade and it's a hard act to follow. Wan tries to up the ante here with the sequel, the scares are more frequent, the demons/ghosts more creepy and the tension is tighter. I still believe the original to be slightly better because it was fresh and the atmosphere was simply brilliant, but Wan does marvellous things with the sequel. <br/><br/>Look to any other horror film and the artistic merit fails by comparison. Wan doesn't need blood and guts or even cheap jump scares to make the viewer scared. He simply builds tension, plays with our expectations and uses creative camera techniques to make the film memorable. One particular scene that stands out in my mind is when Ed first interviews Janet, the little girl who is the focus of the terror. The demon/ghost will not communicate unless they look away, so Ed turns his back to Janet. Wan focuses the camera on Ed, while Janet is out of focus in the background. It's one static shot where the out of focus character slowly and eerily changes into the demon/ghost. We never get a good luck at the thing, but we can see enough to know something is eerily off. Effectively creepy with the simplest camera technique. What other horror director would do something like that today? <br/><br/>Highly recommended for the horror fan and people who really adore the original. Wan has stepped out of the horror genre and has had success (Fast Seven), but he loves the genre too much to abandon it. The man knows how to direct a horror film and he directs this one extremely well. My one complaint is that the film is long. Clocking in well over 2 hours, it feels like it at times. I'd say to maybe take out one of the scares, but I love each one. Add to the fact that most of the effects are practical and it makes me appreciate the film even more."

","'THE CONJURING 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Sequel to the 2013 blockbuster supernatural 'fright flick', once again directed by James Wan (who also helmed the original 'SAW', 'INSIDIOUS' 1 & 2 and 'FURIOUS 7'). It was written by Carey and Chad Hayes (who also wrote the original film), as well as Wan and David Leslie Johnson. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprise the leading roles, as paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. This time they're investigating an aggressive poltergeist, that's haunting a London family (in 1977). The script is once again (said to be) based on a true story. The film also costars Frances O'Connor, Madison Wolfe, Franka Potente and Simon McBurney. It's received good reviews from critics (once again), and it's also another hit at the Box Office (the first movie made over $300 million, on a $20 million budget). I found it to be a more than decent follow-up.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Ed and Lorraine Warren (Wilson and Farmiga) investigating the Amityville murders (in 1974), to see if a demonic presence was really responsible for the horrendous slayings. While experiencing a vision of the crimes, Lorraine foresees Ed's murder (by a tragic impaling). The story then flashes forward 3 years, to London; where a single mother (O'Connor), and her four children, are being terrorized by a supernatural presence. Ed and Lorraine are called to investigate the haunting, but Lorraine is extremely concerned about Ed's safety.<br/><br/>The movie is once again outstandingly crafted, by Wan. It's got great atmosphere, it's disturbingly creepy, and the 'jump scares' are really well done. The story is (once again) intriguing, scary and filled with good character development. It's a little slow-paced, at first, but the film makes up for it in the second half. There's not really much to complain about, but (still) I didn't find it quite as memorable as the original movie.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc"

It literally kept me hooked through out start to finish. The structure worked brilliantly for the scares and dramatic moments. There was plenty of focus on both. (Spoiler alert) I did notice that Wan has used an idea or two from Insidious, with Lorraine entering the void to communicate with the dead in her visions. But yet, it still works<br/><br/>At some points, it literally made my spine shiver. The scares were very effective. Although (a spoiler coming, be warned) the image of The Crooked Man, I thought, looked a bit silly.

And of course, the acting was brilliant from everyone else.<br/><br/>Now for the cinematography and lighting, they were just amazing. They were an added bonus on making the film work even more. My favourite angle in particular was in the scene involving Ed, talking to the spirit of Bill Wilkins. The camera does not leave them and it focuses on Ed with the spirit in the background, which is blurred, with very little detail. I'de have to say, that was one of the best camera techniques I've seen on film.<br/><br/>So overall, the film was absolutely incredible.

"dkim-33796","8","1","4","13 June 2016"," One of the few better horror movies out there.
","Sequels usually breaks down a movie franchise. It's easy to see examples of terrible sequels especially in the years of previous films. And horror movies are no exception, making an impressive horror movie is hard enough. But making a sequel to it is almost committing movie suicide. The Conjuring was good and a lot of people really seemed they enjoyed it. However The Conjuring 2 was spectacular, not only did it had impressive cinematography that captures the absolute tone of a dark and an evil atmosphere. But also it had great camera works and angles that shows both disturbing background and close up images and visuals. The plot in this horror movie is nearly as the same as its predecessor. Haunted house that haunts a family, Warrens comes in to save the day. The movie does have its fair share of clichés here and there however the way that this movie was executed really gave its terror. We get to see a lot of character development in this film, adding in more layers of characterization to both previous and new characters. You get to see the relationship between Ed and Loraine Warren grow as people get doubts about their profession. The family that's being oppressed (The Hodgsons) gets a good backstory and the film does a good job of showing that backstory to the audience. This film also focuses on the public eye and skepticism as well. There were claims that the actual haunting of Enfield was just a hoax in order to have a public attention and director James Wan decided to use this element to drive his movie forward. Showing the realistic reactions how the public would react. The build up and the tension pacing was just right for the film as some scenes had unpredictable jump scares. The movie does another great job of cutting off Loraine's ability of clairvoyance as it was quite helpful in the previous movie. In this movie, she is much more vulnerable to the demonic presence in the house. Exposition and the history of the haunted house really gives you the chills and it adds on to the already high staked tone of the movie. The acting was quite phenomenal, the Hodgson does an amazing job being terrified and scared. The main child actress really steals the show as she delivers an amazing performance of being both possessed and un-possessed. It's truly incredible to see her deal with this possession while being a kid. Since you'd probably get more emotion of a kid being possessed rather than an adult. The soundtrack in this film is the same as the first movie, no soundtrack seems out of place and is given at necessary points in the film, while also using it sparingly throughout the film. <br/><br/>Final Verdict: I will give this movie an 8.0/10 This movie was an upgraded version of The Conjuring. With such skill in the horror genre James Wan delivers one of the chilling horror film of all time. I recommend this movie to anyone. A definitely a ""must see film""."
"Aaron1375","7","1","4","13 June 2016"," From Amityville to Enfield we shall go
","I was not a huge fan of the first film, I thought it was an okay haunted house type story, but I was glad it had the success it did as it garnered an R rating and went on to have a lot of success pulling in over 100 million on a rather small by today's standards budget. My hope was that this would kind of give Hollywood executives the hint that we like our horror to be R and not the PG-13 horror light that fills the theaters these days. This one too is R, and it had a rather sizable opening weekend so I am hoping this one will do a lot of money and show it to them again, because sometimes you got to beat something into a person's head before they get it. I actually liked this one more than the first film too, as I thought it was a bit more graphic than the first film which I thought honestly could have been a PG-13 rated horror film like so many others. This one was well acted and I liked the setting to it more than the last film as it was something different. Sure, most of us know the real story is not as dark and creepy as the movie, but I really do not go into these 'based on a true story' movies thinking I am going to get an accurate retelling of the actual events. If it did that, films that were based on true events would probably put most of us to sleep.<br/><br/>The story starts out in Amityville and details some work the Warrens did in the old house that we have seen in its own series of films. From there we are introduced to a family in England. A mother, whose father has ditched them live in a very run down looking house. There are four children, two girls and two boys. Things begin to happen within the house with the youngest girl seemingly sleep walking and strange noises occurring. Soon, things begin moving around and an old man appears within the house wanting the family to leave. Lorraine Warren, meanwhile, keeps having visions of a demonic nun who seems to be foretelling the death of her husband. She wants to take a break from their investigations, but they are soon pulled into the Enfield haunting and must find out what is behind the girl's strange behavior and the secret of the old man in the house before it is too late! <br/><br/>So this film, to me, was an improvement over the first Conjuring film. From what I have read, this one was written with an R rating in mind while the first they were trying for PG-13, so this one did have more of an edge to it. I also enjoyed the opening scene in the Amityville house as I was not expecting it to be featured. Granted, I am sure most people already knew, but I kind of do not watch television or read anything about films I am going to see to be as surprised as possible. The acting was good, the atmosphere was good and it had some creepy moments. My only problem was that it did run a bit long for a horror film. I thought ten or fifteen minutes could have easily been taken out of this one and not taken away from the story.<br/><br/>So, yes, this film to me was pretty good. I had to see this one in theaters so that it could make as much money as possible so that maybe Hollywood would wake up and realize horror films should be rated R and that the 13 to 16 year old demographic unable to attend a horror film is not going to doom it to failure as many of them will just go with their parents anyways. Unfortunately, they probably still will not get it as another horror film coming up this year called Lights Out is rated PG-13. Looks promising, but it will most likely not have the edge this film did. This film did not kill numerous people and had no sex, it just had a creepy edge to it that made the film R. It also is a throwback to the days when they had decent actors and actresses in horror films and not just super models and buff dudes being stupid. So, I say give this one a go as not only are you end for a creepy good time, you will also be helping this film do well which will hopefully lead to more R rated horror films!"

","In all honesty, I do not know where to begin with 'The Conjuring 2'. For people within the audience that has been following my reviews. You may be aware of myself not being a major fan of present-day horror movies, although I am desperately seeing most horror flicks that come out because I genuinely love the genre. I have been waiting patiently for a horror movie to truly frighten me and make me uncomfortable. With this title, I have finally found that. 'The Conjuring 2' was terrifying and near perfection at the same time. I even was brought to a point where a horror sequence almost made me want to walk out of the theater because I was so uncomfortable and uneasy with the events occurring on screen, Now do not forget, with that being said, it simply means that this was a horror film done right. There were multiple moments, still shots, and sequences that I feel will go down as iconic parts of horror movie history. James Wan will equally become a household name among horror movie fans as he is only continuing to push out impressive horror flicks time after time. 'The Conjuring 2' blew away the original to me and I am confident in saying that this could be THE horror movie of 2016, competitors being 'Don't Breathe' (Evil Dead remake team) and 'Lights Out' (Also directed by James Wan). If you want true terror and fast-paced horror, this is the movie to see. Again, in my opinion, this is the horror movie of 2016."
"furtherdownfilms","8","1","4","13 June 2016"," The Conjuring 2 - Cinema Buffs Review by Nathan Fischer
","Before I went to go see this film, I watched the first Conjuring for the second time since 2013. I remember enjoying it, but upon viewing it a second time it came across as one of the most effective horror movies of recent memory. Now we have the sequel with James Wan returning to direct. This movie takes place after the events of the first film and also after Lorraine and Ed Warrens case in Amityville. The movie takes the same structure as the first. It dives directly in to the horror with an unrelated (or is it?) paranormal case. Then we meet the main family, their struggles with some sort of demonic entity, and Ed and Lorraine come in to help the situation. Although it is the same structure as the last movie, this is a completely different family, story, and location. And it is truly terrifying. The setting is New England. We meet a family of a single mother with four children. Very soon, eerie things begin to happen in the house. It starts at night but quickly starts to happening all the time. The entity has taken a liking to the middle child, a little girl played fantastically by actress Madison Wolfe. It is to be said that all the acting is top notch. There is even a little boy that has a speech impediment, which I thought could go south pretty quickly, but sure enough it is handled with respect and realism. It also focus' on the undeniable love and connection between Lorraine and Ed Warren which we didn't get too much of in the first. Like the first movie, this film is relentless with its terror. There are very few down times and when there are, they are short lived. I find James Won to be the horror master of a new generation. He is smart with his directing. He takes old tropes and gags and blatantly avoids them on screen until he finally gets you with genuine scares. He takes his time and uses the camera like an extension of his mind. I think a lot of this is because of how few cuts there are. The camera follows along, looking in one room then turning down a hallway to look in another. He often leaves his characters small in frame so the audience can look around the screen to catch any subtleties. In one scene, Ed Warren turns his back on the little girl so he can talk to the demon inside her. We see Ed in the foreground, completely in focus, and the little girl behind him, so blurry she is almost indistinguishable. But as the demon begins to speak, the little girl's blurry figure seems to be transforming as the conversation continues. It is horrifying but subtle. She is still very out of focus, so its makes it seem like our eyes are doing it, not the movie. I know I'm gushing, but the movie is not perfect. There are some odd moments of special effects that took me out of the moment. They were cool, but didn't seem to fit. It seemed like James Won was trying to have fun with something different and it just didn't match the overall tone of the film. Also, this movie seemed less grounded in reality then the first. I know sequels are prone to go bigger, and although it worked for this, it just didn't strike to the core of me like the first one did. Regardless, The Conjuring 2 is very scary and has heart to boot. I love seeing great horror in the theater. When it's well done and truly effective, you hear an audience worth of screams followed by and audience worth of laughter. It's just a good time."

","The Conjuring 2 benefited greatly from strong supporting characters to outline an outstanding paranormal story. James Wan has delivered very effective shock scares and surprises that typically do not show up as heavily in other horror movies. <br/><br/>The family, including Ed and Lorraine, are put into an eerie environment while not letting clichés take hold of their decisions. They supported one another, cared for each other, and didn't make dumb decisions that would put themselves in unnecessary harm's way. This element made the movie very enjoyable and absorbing.<br/><br/>Now, with that said, the scares were much more effective. The tension of likable characters being in danger helped make the jump-shock moments feel more ""well-earned"" rather than ""cheap"". Most of these moments came as a surprise, which I thought was almost impossible at this point, but James Wan continues to surprise me with his genius camera tricks and clever twists on where the typical jump scare would be. In addition, the atmosphere set up was very realistic, making the effect on you even more intense.<br/><br/>If you like horror movies even a little bit, you will LOVE this movie. The intense scares are so worth it given the superior acting and themes represented among them."

Now, it is up to Ed & Lorraine Warren to stop this haunting, at any cost. <br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is a good film. However, when you compare this movie to The Conjuring(2013), it just doesn't match up to it. The first film, had some brilliantly executed jump scares & genuinely unnerving scenes. This movie, has some great jump scares too but, they are few & far between. One thing that this movie has going for it that The Conjuring(2013) didn't, is an element of suspense. Director James Wan introduces certain subplots, that he ties together very well with the main story, in the climax of the film. A note on the performances. Patrick Wilson is outstanding as Ed Warren. Vera Farmiga is spectacular as Lorraine Warren. Madison Wolfe is mind blowing as Janet Hodgson. Wolfe at such a young age, portrays a variety of emotions, effortlessly. Frances O'Conner is brilliant as Peggy Hodgson. Lauren Esposito is great as Margaret Hodgson. Benjamin Haigh is superb as Billy Hodgson. Patrick McAuley is awesome as Johnny Hodgson. Simon McBurney is impressive as Maurice Grosse. Maria Doyle Kennedy, Simon Delaney & Franka Potente are effective as, Peggy Nottingham, Vic Nottingham & Anita Gregory, respectively. Bob Adrian & Bonnie Aarons are fantastic as, Bill Wilkins & Demon Nun, respectively. Sterling Jerins is good as Judy Warren. All in all, The Conjuring 2 is a well made film.

","The movies on its own justifies itself to be made by one and only James Wan. If you are a casual watcher, it starts a little slow in first half making you think otherwise but as soon as second half begins, you will realize that all the efforts in first half were necessary and makes sense more.<br/><br/>That being said, once story unfolds of ‪#‎Amityville_of_London‬ you can not stop but bite your nails off and hope for the best for the Ed and Lorraine Warren.<br/><br/>So I would conclude my review for ‪#‎TheConjuring2‬ by saying that you should watch it for its story and direction as the horror part is not that horror as you would expect.

","Once again, James Wan left this die-hard horror movie fan smiling and satisfied. Everything from the interactions between the characters to the sweeping, long takes has been improved since the first film's release in 2013.<br/><br/>This is a film that does not rely on predictable jump-scares to get and keep your attention. However, the dark atmosphere of the haunted home, set in the beautiful (and period correct) 1970's England, will keep you on the edge of your seat as your eyes dart around the screen, searching every dark corner of the decrepit waste of a home for some kind of potential evil. This is where the camera work of this film shines. The long takes are beautifully done. They are slow enough to build tension and paranoia but not too fast that you will miss a monster standing in a dark corner as the camera is focused on an actor.<br/><br/>I took two stars away from a perfect 10/10 score for two reasons: number one... the first hour of the movie provides quite a bit of foreshadowing for the second half, which, once you finish the film, can be excused. I feel like it dragged on for a bit, and could have been done in a more timely manner. Not a big deal. Number two... the CGI of a particular monster (which shall not be named) was sub-par at best, even if it only got a couple of minutes of screen time. It detracted from the atmosphere that James Wan had built, though not enough to break the feeling of dread.<br/><br/>Taking everything into account, this is an excellent film that any fan of the horror genre should see. It will leave you with chills throughout multiple scenes and the overall atmosphere will make you feel uneasy and paranoid. There were several scenes in particular that made me push myself into the chair, trying to subconsciously get away from the screen as much possible.<br/><br/>8/10 Cooper L.W."
"swilliky","8","1","4","9 June 2016"," A terrific and terrifying horror sequel!
","I was greatly impressed with this horror sequel, nothing entertained and frightened me this much in a long time. As far as sequels go, especially horror sequels, this movie is beyond comparison. There are some very minor flaws of special effects but these take nothing away from the terror and the great story of the Warrens' next adventure.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga return as Ed and Lorraine Warren and are more comfortable in their roles as the paranormal investigators. The story begins with a short recounting of their most famous case, the Amityville house. This sets up the spooky demonic nun that has graced the trailers for the last few weeks. This nun is freaky and will haunt my nightmares for the next few nights. The Warrens have garnered some respect for their work but also have to face more skeptics. Lorraine as has to deal with premonitions of her husband's death. It takes a while but eventually the couple is summoned to London for a new mission. <br/><br/>James Wan does a terrific job with the camera work showing just enough to have viewers squirming in their seats before the boom and jump scares. He ratchets up the tension and tells a story that does justice to the original and true story this event was based on. The dark hallways and the flooded basement are a perfect setting for the hauntings. I hope that Wan returns to the horror genre after Aquaman because he has the formula down and has developed a great talent for this type of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"InDyingArms","9","1","4","9 June 2016"," Eerie, and still strong with the utter intensity!
","The long awaited sequel ( At least for me ) has finally come as we're presented with a sequel for one of the bigger, more effect modern horrors over the years, The Conjuring 2. <br/><br/>This movie is an overall headstrong sequel I'd say, unlike other sequels this one keeps its intensity, and overall chills cranked up through the roof, just like the first one. The atmosphere in this movie is eerie, and overly bone chilling. You get shots of which are so dark, along with the soundtrack being so quiet to where us, the audience are sitting in complete and utter unsettlement as we are set within such a white-knuckle tension zone over most of the movie. The film sets an amazing tone for creepiness, keeping the movie mostly dark-like, and eerie, of which deeply succeeds when it comes to the breakdown of the demon / ghost appearances. The overall soundtrack of the film, as well when it comes down to such actions also adds onto the overall film effect that it has going for it. Overall the film is like the first one when it comes to succeeding complete, and utter creepiness, and overall eye candy tension. Something some horror films try, but miss the mark on, leading to this factor being as the first film, a pleasant surprise. For the acting in this film, again, of which you'll hear be said a lot in this review; Like the first film, the acting was well played out. The kids in this film did a quite believable with portraying their emotions, mostly for this film either serious, scared, or upset. This movie also does a flawless job for making the audience feel for this family. The audience overall watches as this family goes through the struggle of getting people to overall believe they're truly being haunted, and overall provoked. At the same time they're battling a war between them, the truth, and the media. So overall the film does an amazing job for having us, the audience truly feel emotion for this family, and only want the absolute best for them in the end. Ed, and Lorraine from the first film, as well have some new, and unique character unleashes in this sequel as well. They both have a somewhat deeper side to them shown in this film, their true care for what they do, and their overall emphasis, and even love for each other are perfectly shown, and executed without being TOO much in depth to it. We also see some new, pretty exciting - like characters enter the sequel as well, overall great actors, and amazing twist of deep, inner-character ties along with it all as well, coming out as flawless, and another outstanding surprise! Now for the good stuff. The demons / demon in this film is absolutely creepy. This film did an amazing job with it I would say all the way. The film throws the demon in hidden places throughout camera shots, making it insanely creepy for those who spot it. And when blatantly seen, even then this demon comes off as truly frightening, and just flat out creepy. And yet another succeeding, and outstanding tie-in this film brought to the table was the fact that demon actually came within different forms. Something to understand, along with everything else here, you'd have to see the movie to figure out. <br/><br/>Overall. This sequel was one hell of a watch. You have great story, well executed actors, creepy, unsettling, and flat out eerie tone, and atmosphere, whether it be the soundtrack, happenings in the film itself, or the demon appearances itself, the film overall comes off in the sense of it all being nightmarish. This was an outstanding sequel, and definitely didn't miss the mark. If you enjoyed the first film, your expectations shall not be disappointed in the Conjuring 2. See it all to believe."
"isommaren","1","1","5","25 May 2019"," Nothing scary about this one
","I'm not a big fan of the Conjuring movies, and their many many spin-offs. They try hard, but don't deliver. They use too many jump scares, and really really bad CGI. I laughed at the ending, because like in the first movie, they really needed to wrap things up and didn't really care about the plot anymore.
The children acted brilliantly, but I couldn't stop laughing during the part with the playing Elvis songs on the guitar part. Why?
I can only say one good thing about this movie, Annabelle and the Nun are a lot worse, and I bet more bad ones are on their way, as long as there are people out there who love over the top bad CGI and jump scares (not me). I like scary movies, but I want them to be original and actually with a good storyline, and not the regular 2010 CGI which is in every horror movie these days."

In all honesty, if I could rate this flick more than 10 stars, I would without a doubt. Every time there was s scary scene, it gave me chills.

","Even better than the first. Fantastic sequel that has Lorraine and Ed's storyline a lot more interconnected throughout the film. They consistently show a very tight knit couple that is heavily engaged in their work against evil. Same main cast is back but in a new scary story in a new country!!! The film also delves more deeply into very interesting lessons about understanding Good and Evil. Characters deliver excellent performances that are balanced between skepticism and belief about the supernatural. Lorraine and Ed play great emotional scenes that run the gamut. The movie feels very authentic for its time period so that you really feel like it is occurring during the 1970s. Well-paced scares that supply consistent twinges of fear along with moments of utter shock. It is a dark world that keeps you thoroughly enthralled, wanting to see what happens to these characters, and how in the world they will be able to resolve the demonic problem at hand. Filmmakers pay particular attention to inserting small but important cues that neatly tie the entire movie together. Would totally recommend and cannot wait for Conjuring 3."

","I should admit that I haven't seen the previous movies in the Conjuring franchise. ""The Conjuring 2"" comes across as a clone of ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"" and ""Poltergeist"". As to the issue of the whole story's accuracy, I'm not interested in that. I'd prefer it if horror movies emphasized the unknown over cheap surprises, as ""The Shining"" did. James Wan has directed better movies than this (Saw, Dead Silence), while Vera Farmiga (The Departed) and Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) have starred in better. I don't recommend the movie.<br/><br/>So part of the investigation took place on Christmas in 1977. I guess that they heard on the news that Charlie Chaplin died that day."

","If I were to rate this movie on the basis of its' scariness and watch ability, then I can happily give it around 7-8 as my vote. Unfortunately by the credits both at the beginning and end of the film the makers of it are trying to 'con' viewers into believing that the events in the movie are true:<br/><br/>Not correct. The picture tries to suggest the story is based on true events occurring in London in the the 1970's know as the ""Enfield Poltergeist"". A child/children of a household claimed to be demonically possessed attracting widespread publicity. However in real life the evidence ultimately led to the conclusion that it was all a hoax. Any one can do a little research on the internet to discover the true events.<br/><br/>If the film makers had produced a story exposing the lies of the hoaxers then they would have done a good job in film making and truth telling. But purely to sell tickets they have produced one big lie and totally fictionalized what really happened under the pretense that it is fact.<br/><br/>Therefore I deduct 3 points from my vote and rate this movie:<br/><br/>5/10."

"MattBirk","5","1","10","11 June 2016"," Same Creepy Atmosphere but Ruined by another Derivative Story
","The Conjuring 2 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some unquestionable scary scenes but it also has a ton of unnecessary jump scares where the volume goes from whisper quite to jet engine loud. I'm sure the average Joe or teenager will eat them up and proclaim the movie to be a horror classic, but to me it's not scares that makes a horror movie great. That being said, if you are someone that doesn't mind jump scares, you will most likely eat this movie up!<br/><br/>A lot of the good ideas and moments from the first film are present here in the sequel, the likable Warrens, a standout scare scene (the painting scene), plenty of raising tension, and an eerie score. The problem, however, is that it's all dragged out over the course of two hours and ten minutes. That leaves plenty of time for boredom to set in and room for those less engaging moments (or should I say numerous, cheap jump scare scenes). It seems as though the executives or producers of the movie wanted Wan to through in as many scares as possible, ignoring pacing and runtime. Which leads to many scenes being unnecessarily long and plenty of throw away jump scares.<br/><br/>Not only are some scare scenes tepid, but some are flat out cheesy. Anytime the girl is possessed and the evil, old man 'speaks' it's damn near laughable. Mostly because 'a man's voice coming out of a little girl' isn't anything new nor is it haunting. <br/><br/>When all's said and done, The Conjuring 2 has the same eerie atmosphere from the first film that made it enjoyable, but also the generic storyline that plagued the first film. Amplify that story with an unbearable two hour plus runtime and you get, in my opinion, a failed sequel (even if it does have some scary scenes)."

Unlike the predecessor where the horror and terror was primary, this film has given weight for many other aspects as well.<br/><br/>Still James Wan has brought his signature moves to keep the film alive and powerful.<br/><br/>Not scary as the hype in my perspective.

"anthony-burton4","3","0","1","21 January 2020"," How can the same director get it so wrong?
","Firstly can I say that The Conjuring - the first movie, was one of the best haunted house movies I've seen, if not the best. While it brought little new to the genre, there is after all only limited scope for this, what it delivered was impeccable, and it avoided using manipulative ""effects"", visual and sound, in order to deliver its thrills.<br/><br/>The follow-up, ""The Conjuring 2"", by contrast manages to get everything wrong!<br/><br/>For starters in the original, while based on a ""true story"", i.e. the events in the movie were as reported and investigated by Ed & Lorraine, this is irrelevant - it adds little (unless you believe it's all real) and it certainly takes nothing away - the second movie makes it more of a mission statement. For background, the haunting was thoroughly investigated and plenty of evidence came to light that the girls were faking it - paranormal investigators were heavily criticised for accepting that some of the events WERE faked but still believing the haunting was real! The movie faithfully covered all of this and in doing so, destroyed the suspension of belief, viewers are asked to engage when watching this kind of movie. How can you believe the haunting is real, when the movie is showing you evidence it isn't? You end up viewing many of the events as totally laughable - it's rather like Scooby Doo in places!<br/><br/>Secondly, the original spent just the right amount of time setting the scene: letting you into the family's life so you like them, and then building up the suspense oh so slowly to the point you are desperate for Ed And Lorraine to get involved and help. The Conjuring 2 however runs two thread plots from the start, one set in England, and one set at the Warren's home - it's not clear at all if they interact, never mind how until the end of the movie. It tries to build up BOTH threads, but as a result it takes twice as long and you end up bored - not just that, but the constant chopping and changing ruins the effect. It's not until the last 30 mins of the 134 min long movie that the action begins and it's over in a trice with a frankly absurd plot suddenly sprung upon the viewer.<br/><br/>The setting is problematic, while a remote farmhouse with a foreboding tree next to a still lake gives a perfect background to a ghost story, a 70's council estate really doesn't. OK, so that's where the Enfield haunting occurred, but it makes it all less believable.<br/><br/>Finally, the shocks - yes I jumped a couple of times, but that was simply due to cheap effects. The movie isn't remotely scary, well maybe to young children it could be, but to an adult, it's more like pantomime. Nearly everything that is going to happen is predictable, the camera work if nothing else, telegraphs it.
The fact that we hardly got to know the family involved either since most of their lines were simply various types of screaming (yes, there's plenty of that - maybe to make up for the lack of it from the audience?), so it was difficult to care about whether anything happened to them anyway.<br/><br/>In short, while I awarded the first movie 8 and it may even rise to a 9 after a second viewing, this offering is total junk."
"boris_unanimate","3","0","2","31 December 2019"," The Conjuring of More Childish Horror
","The Conjuring 2 is the best example of what's wrong with modern horror. It's formulaic, predictable, uninventive, and only scary if you're a child that is afraid of loud noises and ghost stories. The fact that the Warrens have been proven to be frauds who were attention seekers doesn't help.<br/><br/>Rarely have I seen a movie this bland, dragging and unimaginative. The writing left me blase at best, furious at how childish it is at worst. The cinematography is so boring and basic, even TV cooking shows look like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison. After watching the first Conjuring I thought they might do it better this time, but it just keeps getting worse. James Wan is definitely a hack.<br/><br/>If you want a really scary movie about evil entities, watch the Spanish masterpiece Aterrados.

","To make an event movie out of your basic horror film is no easy feat - a genre for everyone it ain't - so kudos to ""The Conjuring"" and its sequel for pulling an ""Exorcist"" and turning even the most hesitant members of the general public into temporary aficionados of the macabre. Three years have passed since the original and nothing's much changed; still intact are lean, mean, and very devilish thrills not to be messed with - James Wan could turn the adventures of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren into a franchise and I wouldn't much be bothered by his audacity. This year's follow-up to the 2013 juggernaut expectedly pales in comparison to its predecessor - how could it not - but it's unusual in that it could very well stand on its own and still be regarded as a solid piece of terrifying exhibition. Success is rare for any sequel to a critical and commercial triumph, especially for the horror genre, and ""The Conjuring 2,"" against the odds, delivers the goods without attempting to outdo or undermine the beast that made it. As the film opens, we find the movie's previous protagonists, the aforementioned Warrens, recovering from the psychological wounds left by their 1976 investigation of the Amityville murders. Ed, per usual, has quickly compartmentalized the case into the deepest pits of his mind, figuring it better to abstain from unhealthy dwelling, but Lorraine, a possessor of psychic powers, has become immensely disturbed by the events experienced in the wretched home. She's considering quitting her self-made profession; she's not so sure she can continue carry the weight of someone else's literal demons. But before she can give her skepticisms too much serious thought, the Warrens are drawn to an intriguing case across the pond. Due to overzealous tabloid coverage, the recent hauntings of the lower-class Hodgson family has become all the rage in town gossip and in news stories. According to several reports varying in their authenticity, Janet (Madison Wofle), the second oldest of four children, has been suffering from strange bouts of sleepwalking and, most dramatically, instances of possession. The flat in which the family's living seems to be tormented by a poltergeist unwilling to leave - and as time drags on, malice increases. Naturally, Ed and (a hesitant) Lorraine take the long flight over in hopes to dig deeper. All that surrounds them, of course, is much more complex than anyone could ever realize. And so retained is the fun of the first ""Conjuring"" in its sequel; it's a skillfully designed and executed horror show with more than a few whodunit undertones lurking underneath its jump scare tactics. We grow to care about its characters just as much the solving of the central mystery, and the Warrens, already such likably offbeat heroes, are provided with increased depth that reminds us that in front of us are not pulpy ghostbusters but genuinely vulnerable people who just so happen to have extremely difficult jobs. So while I'm easily able to admit that ""The Conjuring 2"" is not as spine-chilling as the film preceding it - there's a higher reliance on slammed doors, too-quickly-revealed foes, and generalized possession tropes (and there's certainly no equivalent to the first film's memorable clap supplemented basement scare sequence) - there's no denying that on display is an intelligent horror blockbuster more than likely to satisfy the thirsts of fans of the 2013 film and horror pundits alike."

","After watching The Conjuring a couple of days ago, my husband and I decided to give 2 a chance and we both regret it. The film was extremely slow-paced with no jump-scares and left us feeling more like we were watching a low intensity thriller than a true horror. This is based on a true story of a London haunting, however, it is desperately inaccurate to the actual story.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film this was a flop. More than two hours long and the plot only begins to take shape an hour in. I don't recommend this if you actually want to be scared and the CGI was disappointing too."

","An excellent continuation of the series; watch the first, then this one (assuming the first is something you enjoy..........and it had better be as it is excellent!!! :P).<br/><br/>A lot of reviews are including things like 'nothing new' or 'not groundbreaking' etc, but in the sea of crap horror movies the Conjuring movies stand out for doing things *right*. The characters don't do 'stupid things' just to keep the movie going, no cheesy crap to TRY to scare you. With incredibly few exceptions everything is 'purposeful' and nothing takes you out of the movie. You don't wonder 'why didn't they do this?' or 'why did that happen?'<br/><br/>I can't begin to count the number of horror movies I've watched, and the vast majority, literally within 5-10 minutes of the movie starting 'force' something to happen to establish the plot, and you never get sucked into the movie. So far both Conjuring movies avoid this and many other common pitfalls of this genre.<br/><br/>The only 'negative' is for the whole 'universe' of the Conjuring, the Nun, Annabelle, etc etc, etc, which is the 'spin offs' are almost entirely drivel and have little if any involvement with James Wan."

","If the first Conjuring was a simple old-school kind of horror movie that resulted in a breath of fresh air, this second part is the opposite.
This tries to be everything the first wasn't:
If the first one didn't rely that much on jumpscares to scare you, but rather in building tension, this one has to have a loud noise every minute.
If the first one was a simple story of a house with a demon, that reached a not so dumb satisfaying climax near the end, this one has to be this grandiosity were people fly and have superpowers and can see the future and blah blah blah.
If the first one had great acting from all (except the family father), in this one the child actors have to suck.
If the first one didn't have an overlong runtime, this has to be over two hoursand twenty minutes.
You get why i'm trying to say? This movie has this aspiration to be grandiose, but it doesn't need to.
I have to recognize the film is not that bad, it has some great aspects like the cinematography, but it doesn't reach the level of the original. You can skip it, or you can watch it, but don't expect anything really good."

"ConnorMacleodoftheClanMacleod","9","0","1","1 June 2019"," A little faith goes a long way...
","First off let me start by saying that I do not usually enjoy horror films at all. I usually think that they are over done and are saturised so much that they lose their effect, I was one of the unfortunate few that watch Scary movie 2 before seeing the Exorcist, those who know will know.<br/><br/>However, the Conjuring 2 has got to be up there with the greats of horror. James Wan has created a perfectly balanced series following the lives and events of the Ed and Lorraine Warren, followers of the occult will know these names well, and it is this that I think the horror genre comes out the strongest, before going into this film you are aware that the characters and in fact the Enfield Haunting are all based on some form of truth. James Wan plays on this very very well, with a talented cast to direct, an era of British history that was one of fear, poverty, dissent and the masters of CGI he brings to life a true horror story.<br/><br/>We are first introduced again to Ed and Lorraine in the house of the Amytiville horror scene where Lorraine enters a translucent state to discover what has occurred, from that point you are sitting on the edge of you r seat as she follows the path of the murder throughout the house. She is then thrown into the cellar of the house where she witnesses 'The Nun' stalking her and showing her an image of Ed dying horrifically. This sets the pace of the whole film. Wan then throws us over to England where we meet the Hodgson's, a normal family struggling in a crumbling house and trying to make ends meet, the introduction of a Ouija board then has us drop our heads, it's all downhill for the family from there folks. I will ruin no more but the slow decay of innocence of the kids truly terrifies, the spectral occurrences makes you jump and the ignorance of all around has you shouting at the screen. It makes you realise that the evil powers all but need to play on doubt to truly win.<br/><br/>All in all this film is a masterpiece, Wan has created a true horror film in all sense. It is a battle between good and evil which is what horror films should be. I would watch this continuously!"

","First, the all-important question: Is The Conjuring 2 scary? Like, jump out of your seat, watch through your outstretched fingers scary? The answer to that is ""yes."" Under James Wan's direction, even the most clichÃ©d haunted-house tropes (and this movie is bursting with them) are genuinely creepy, and although the movie isn't overly reliant on jump scares, the ones it does use-well, they work. On a lizard-brain level, The Conjuring 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark, and some of its simplest moments-like a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlight-are its most effective, bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and Don Burgess' gloomy cinematography."

","I am slightly spooked by something concerning my watching experience of this movie. I watched ""The Conjuring 2"" in two sessions, I watched the first third on 17th April, then the last two thirds on 19th. Then I went online to search for more information about Lorraine Warren, that was when I found out she just passed away on 18th April. Thus, during the time period I watched this movie, she passed away. Was there something that mystically influenced me to watch this movie? I do not know.<br/><br/>What I do know, however, is that the movie is pretty good. It's a solid, pleasant surprise that ""The Conjuring 2"", as a sequel, is better than the previous ""Conjuring"" movie. That is why I have decided to check out some other movies of the Conjuring franchise.<br/><br/>Now, even if you are not a fan of horror movies, I still recommend you watch this movie, just to enjoy the excellent actings, especially by Madison Wolfe (who plays the main possessee). Wolfe is American; however, her British accent is flawlessly convincing. The emotions she showed in the movie are realistic and impressive. She's brilliant."
"jordanrgs","8","0","1","28 April 2019"," Good sequel but they got cheesy with it
","The first Conjuring film was an exagerated take on a real case, as is this sequel. However, the first movie had some form of realism to it. Yes, there were your standard horror possession effects; upside down chairs, detailed full body apparitions and demons... But it was kept to a minimal. It relied heavily on atmosphere and story build up.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 tries doing the same, but failed in comparison to the first. Additional CGI that was pretty laughable should NOT have been added. The Crooked Man instantly turned the film into what felt like a ""pg-13"" horror film experience.... Turning a somewhat believable experience into a more farfetched hollywood horror film. The parts that freak me out the most in the Conjuring films are the parts where objects move on their own, doors open by themselves and footsteps can be heard where nobody is. People might get bored by that and not find it scary, but I do find that hard to believe considering the atmosphere James Wan has created. Overall, this film had great acting, decent story and some good scares, but I think it would have been better without the CGI scares."

","The recent passing of Lorraine Warren prompted me to finally watch this sequel to the The Conjuring. The first one gave me nightmares and I have a feeling this one will too. I'm more easily scared these days, but this still felt like one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 was horror film-making at its creepiest best. I felt like I couldn't really come up for air during its over 2 hour duration. The scares and creepy scenes just felt relentless (almost too much so). At one stage, my dog looked at me (with my hands over my eyes) as if to say, ""what the hell is wrong with you?""<br/><br/>I'm a huge Vera Farmiga fan, and she is perfectly suited to the role of Lorraine. Patrick Wilson puts in a good performance too, and they share excellent onscreen chemistry. Whether or not you believe in ghosts or this particular case, it was still unbelievably terrifying - particular for me, who grew up in a haunted house.<br/><br/>I'm not religious, but the religious element here was done well (without being preachy) and gave a bit of an Exorcist vibe to things. The film felt like a combination of Poltergeist, The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror.<br/><br/>It was unexpectedly feel-good too! The ending made me smile and I certainly didn't think The Conjuring 2 would be the most uplifting film I'd seen in recent weeks. In saying that, it wasn't exactly a relaxing Friday night watch.<br/><br/>RIP Ed and Lorraine - together again."

","This is by far the best film in the Conjuring Universe so far. It's suspenseful and creepy. Let me get some negatives out of the way. There were some shaky cam moments in the beginning of the film that made no sense story wise. 2 of the 4 child actors weren't that good but what do you expect from child actors. The night scenes in the house in the first half of the film were too dark just like the original Conjuring movie but James Wan fixes this halfway through the movie. Now let's get onto the positives. The main cast and most of the supporting cast did an outstanding job in their respective roles within the film. Ed and Lorraine Warren were given better story arcs than the first film. The cinematography was great throughout the film and had some really nice tracking shots that weren't too long and weren't too short. The tone remained consistent throughout the film and the plot was pretty good. I understood what was going on throughout the entire film. The demons in this movie are flat out creepy. The Nun got me every time it was on screen and the Crooked Man's design was great. I swear they used stop motion animation for the Crooked Man. If they did, then they blended his character really well with the live action scenes. The scenes with both those demons added suspense and terror to an already terrifying film. Overall, The Conjuring 2 improves from most of the mistakes from the original film while adding better cinematography, a better supporting cast, and scarier demons."

","While 2013's ""The Conjuring"" managed to become a modern horror classic rather quickly thanks to its effective screenplay, terrific performances, and slow-build horror scares, its bloated, overlong sequel seems to go in the opposite direction. On paper, documenting the Enfield poltergeist - allegedly one of the most well-documented cases of real-life paranormal activity - is a good move for the sequel: It has the weight of media validity, not to mention the strong directorial vision of James Wan, as well as the gravitas of returning stars Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. But the drab setting, drained color palette, and strained performances of Frances O'Connor and her on-screen children erode the audience's enjoyment, negating any fun-scares to be had along the way. What's left is a preposterous 133-minute running time with a dragged-out climax that feels both disjointed and purposeless, and while a few moments here and there manage to raise some goosebumps, the majority of the scares are too thunderous to register. The movie is watchable thanks to the likable duo of Farmiga and Wilson as well as residual good-will from the first movie, but it feels unsatisfying overall."
"hayovanderwolk","8","0","1","13 November 2018"," Finally a Great sequel!
","The Conjuring 2 is Great! It is my favourite horror movie to date. And that is because of two reasons: James Wan, and because i'm someone that is always open to new pieces of art instead of living in the past like a lot of people. And this movie is truly a piece of art. The painting room scene with the Nun is probably the best made horror scene I have ever seen. It shows James Wan at his best. Wan really knows how to build tension. From the creepy soundtrack that to the silent night scenes. He doesn't show the demons a lot, and that is maybe the best thing of this movie. Because these days movies are all about: Lets give the people all we got! Then they must like it! And so they will come back and spend there money again! Let me give an example: Jurassic Park is a true masterpiece, the Top of what a good action/thriller should be. You don't see the dino's a lot but just enough to be scared and know what they are capable of. The supporting characters also build on that tension by talking about how dangerous the threat is and what it can do, so when you see the T-rex for the first time it feels even more like a true monster that has come alive. Now look at the lates 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' there is a scene were they are fleeing from the bursting vulcano while hundreds of dino's are beside them. It's explosions and dinosaurs everywhere and it makes you look at a dinosaur like it's a crocodile or elephant: it's kinda cool but you have seen it many times. Now let's take that comparison to The Conjuring 2. James Wan doesn't show anything until the last moment, when the tension is so high that you are sitting at the end of your seat and already thougt for at least two times that the jumpscare would come, THEN is the moment that he hits you with a scary demon that creeps out of the dark, ready to kill the only good left inside you. But thats not all. The reason why the painting room is so good imo is because it goes against anything I just said. Wan has let you get used a little bit to the type of scares I just mentioned and then switches it up out of the blue. Normally in most horrors these days, the night scenes are for scares and the day scenes are for a little comedic relieve. But then James Wan gives you the Nun....... the most scary character ever and out of nowhere she is standing in the hallway in the middle of the day! That scares people even more because it is almost like she is breaking into your home. You have gotten so used to the relieve part during the day scenes from this movie and all other horror movies, that it is creepy and unexpected.<br/><br/>This movie also had other great essentials for a good sequel: character development, no cameos, a small story and not trying to make it bigger then necessary, good cinematography and a fine plot.<br/><br/>This is the best movie James Wan has to give us to date, it is a thrill and deserves recognition. Let's hope the 3e movie will be just as good and not rushed because this one was a succes."

"Katherine777","6","0","1","15 September 2017"," Don't get the hype. Was it a horror game or a movie?
","Hated the movie, for one simple reason. CGI effects. It's not scary when the subject of fear in the movie looks like something that came from a video game, or like a sticker/emoji. It would be a 1000 times more scary if they'd be reasonable enough not to mask everything in effects and jump scares. Jump scares is equal to a comedian tickling his audience. The beauty in horror movies is the tension, suspense, the build up, and the point (in my opinion) is to sympathize with the protagonist, but I can't do that if the antagonist looks like animated version of Marilyn Manson, literally. Make up should cover the scary part, plot-wise it was okay, but nothing I haven't seen before, nothing unique. The Conjuring 1 was way scarier and more interesting than this sequel."
"Foxbarking","2","0","2","4 August 2017"," Ludicrous Nonsense
","I should have known going into this that I would not be able to enjoy this movie. Although I like James Wan quite a bit, the subject matter of these movies is just not something I can get over. They would have a done a better job if they didn't pretend that this movie was really based on a true story.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie is the depiction of Ed and Lorraine Warren as heroic figures. In reality, they are grimy charlatans who make up stories and exploit peoples' wanting to believe in the supernatural to make money. They have been exposed repeatedly as frauds. However, this movie tries to make them heroes. It's impossible for me to see them this way and this made any chance I could like this movie just go out the window.<br/><br/>Also, there are plenty of recent horror movies based off of supposed real stories. Most of them do a better job of at least not being so outlandish that no one with sense could possibly believe it. <br/><br/>So, let's pretend for an instant that this movie just was admittedly a fiction movie. Let's pretend for a moment that the heroes weren't a couple of slime bag con artists. Let's pretend they presented this film as it was. Would it have been enjoyable? Possibly. Will I ever know? Not really.<br/><br/>Even so, it would not have been scary. But the main point is that if I can not root for the hero, I can not like a movie. And the last think the Warrens are or ever have been are heroes. Avoid it."
"80sHorror","10","0","2","5 March 2017"," A good sequel! Highly recommended!
","Wow!! Just wow!! James Wan is fast becoming by top horror director of all time. So far the Insidious franchise has put my faith back in actual scary horror movies and not the awful horror violence movies such as Rob Zombies god awful Halloween 2 where there is nothing scary whatsoever seeing someone stabbed 13 times. But with Dead Silence, Insidious and now The Conjuring, James Wan has made and produced some classic horrors. With the first Conjuring, I thought it was excellent up to the kind of rip-off ending where it reminded me far too much of The Exorcist. That was my only gripe with the film though.<br/><br/>In The Conjuring 2 however, yes we have another possession but it is the three 'demons' that Wan has added to this movie which just terrifies you. It was bad enough having nightmares about Red Faced Demon and The Bride in Black from Insidious. Now we have Bill Wilkins (The Old Man), The Nun and The Crooked Man. All three of these played on my fears that I had as a kid and they were truly terrifying. Like with Annabelle who was introduced in The Conjuring and got her own spin off film, the same will now happen with The Nun in this film and I for one can't wait. A special mention must go to the production design as well because the house that the family live in in this movie would be terrifying WITHOUT all the haunting's going on!! Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren are even better in this than the first one and are a great on screen couple with quite a nice scene at the end dancing to an Elvis Presley track."

","For years, I've been telling people that the scariest horror movie I've ever seen is 'The Exorcist.' Well, all that changed after watching 'The Conjuring 2.' All I can say is, Wow! James Wan, who I've been following since his 2004 feature 'Saw,' has shown amazing growth as a purveyor of the demonic. And his understanding of the intrinsic nature of evil from a Catholic perspective rivals that of William Peter Blatty, who I have greatly admired since reading his novel THE EXORCIST, upon which the movie was based.<br/><br/>Now, I enjoyed 'The Conjuring' which, like the sequel, is based on a paranormal case by real-life investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. After seeing that movie, I began researching the Warrens and learned about the case in England, where the story of 'The Conjuring 2' takes place. The fact that these are actual cases and involve demonic possession both intrigues and horrifies me. As a Catholic, I believe in Hell. And I believe that demons like the one featured in 'The Conjuring 2' have walked the earth long before man. Perhaps this is why, for me, the film is so frightening.<br/><br/>Flipping around the dial the other day, I happened across the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' reboot from 2010. Though well made, it wasn't scary. I know Freddie Kreuger is a fantasy character and, despite the sharpness of his homemade claws, he's just another homicidal killer. And I feel that way about most horror movies involving monsters. 'The Babadook' is a great example. Yes, he's paper-thin and creepy. But that's about it. I was more moved by the exasperated, sleep-deprived Amelia and her lonely, desperate attempts at creating a normal life for her troubled son, Samuel. Conversely, when the demon in 'The Conjuring 2' takes on the form of The Crooked Man, I ended up halfway out of my seat—which is a tribute to the genius of James Wan.<br/><br/>Like most folks, I believe horror movies do well because people like to be scared. It's a rush similar to riding a roller coaster. And when it's over, you're relieved. But every once in a while a film comes along that disturbs the viewer to the core, its aftereffect lingering for days. 'The Conjuring 2' is just such a movie. And an estimated $40M in box office receipts at the time of this writing—this kind of story sells.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying that a film like this will turn an atheist into a believer. But it might make those who are on the fence about God, angels and demons think twice before picking up the planchette from that Ouija board collecting dust in the corner with those other games. My advice—just say no."

","This film tells the story of the famous exorcists couple from the Church, who wants to stop investigating and confronting the paranormal. However, the Church sends them to London to investigate a very sinister haunting in a north London house that is home to a single mother and her four children.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" was so super scary that I rate it as one of the scariest films for me. ""The Conjuring 2"" follows a similar plot, with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson investigating and confronting the demonic spirits. There are many scary scenes in this film, to the point that I developed a headache towards the end because I was so scared. Yet, the general feel of the film is not as scary compared to the first film. I think perhaps it is because the final showdown is short, and the demon appeared way too late in the film. Still, it is a very scary film!"

","The first conjuring really was good and creepy. First it was Annabelle and now it's The Nun in this one really took the cake in this sequel. The next story about Ed and Laurianne warren where they are headed to London to help a struggling family with the ghost who wants a young girl does seem a lot like The Exorcist but the movie has brilliantly time scares and knows how to keep anyone interested. When the conjuring two starts it will begin with a good scare and will keep on delivering unpredictable moments of jumps and scares until the very last minute of the movie with what is definitely the most creepiest part and ironic part of the movie and let's hope that these movies will keep on being made because this will be a franchise that will never stop being successful and popular"

","Wow, such a scary movie!! Vera Farmiga has to be one of my favorite actresses ever! She cares about her roles so well and she puts such heart to them! I love her in Bates Motel as well. I believe I liked this better than the first one. The first one was so great but I just didn't care for the other characters in the story, but this one I do. I feel so bad for the little girl and the family and I want the Warrens to help her and her family. The whole family is great and you really feel for them. This is such a creepy and scary movie and the special effects in this movie are so great! I will always love the Conjuring movies and after seeing this I do consider them some of my favorite scary movies. The one thing I absolutely love about this movie is that Faith plays a big part in the movie. I am a Christian and it is so refreshing to see a scary movie that has faith as one of the main parts in the movie when so many scary movies don't. I love that faith plays a big role in Ed and Lorraine Warren's marriage and family. This stuff is real and I love that this story is based on real events. It shows that God is real and Satan is real as well."

","""The Conjuring 2"" is the sequel to ""The Conjuring"", a pretty successful horror film from 2013. The director and one of the many writers here is once again James Wan, a Malaysian filmmaker who truly made it big in Hollywood. But the title of my review also refers to him and his career a bit. He worked on ""Saw, ""Insidious"", ""Conjuring"" and more horror films, so he is certainly one of the defining directors of the genre right now. But it seems as if he has sacrificed a great deal of creativity in case he ever had it. I personally was not a great fan of the first Conjuring movie and I am also not too big on this one here. The film itself is also where the title of my review applies. It is basically a summation of all kinds of elements used in all kinds of horror films in the past. Unseen danger. Very visible danger. Exorcist elements. Danger in the water. Children and women who get scared the hell out of them. Tough-ass male characters who want to fight the dark spirits at any cost etc.<br/><br/>The two protagonists are played by Farmiga and Wilson just like in the first film and this is basically another chapter to their profession. However, with Farmiga's character's reaction on some occasions, I truly wonder why she would work in a field like this and not do a quiet office job or so. Also the couple not only runs into scary nuns and dead senior characters that take control of little girls, but they also have to deal with people who criticize their profession and say it's all nonsense, which also does not make any sense overall. So yeah, this film is really packed, but sadly it's like a 100 puzzle parts and almost none of them fit together or result in a convincing overall outcome. In one scene, Farmiga's character is scared to death, in the next it seems like nothing could scare her at all. How is that even possibly. The weakest moment was maybe the (seemingly) self-sacrifice scene of the male protagonist towards the end, which was pretty cringeworthy honestly. I see almost no really creative element in this film here, which sucks a lot and hurts the viewing experience too. This is especially painful as this movie runs for a massive 2 hours and 15 minutes almost, extremely long and you could actually see it as a mini-series in 3 parts of 45 minutes if you wanted. If you add the first movie, you almost have a real mini-series in terms of the length of both films taken together and if they ever make a third film, which they probably will looking at the success of the first two and how Wan loves sequels, then more will be added. As for me, this second film was already one too many, maybe even the first. The performances are also all very generic and bring nothing great to the screen, just like the script. Don't watch."

","The Conjuring 2 was a really good sequel first time I watched it I was a bit too skeptical so I didn't end up enjoying it as much as I could have but now I've watched it a few more times and I got to say it's awesome. I like the part in the beginning where Lorraine is in a trance at the Amityville house and she kind of was reliving the murders in that house while in a trance she also had a premonition of Ed's death which I thought was a pretty messed up scene plus when you see The Nun for the first time it really creeps you out sends chills down your spine to me the creepiest part of this movie is The Nun you don't know who the hell she is,what the hell she's doing there or anything. That was just the beginning though the Amityville haunting it's mainly based on the haunting in Enfield that's in North London it's basically this girl Janet slowly being possessed this spirit of this old man called Bill Wilkins who used to live in that house and died in the chair in the corner was supposedly the one doing it but then you find out it's something much more sinister an inhuman spirit I know this is a huge spoiler for those of you who haven't seen this but I have to talk about it it turned out that Bill Wilkins was actually being used as a puppet by The Nun from the beginning of the movie and she really wanted the girl Janet she wanted to fully possess her for some reason I didn't really understand why. Every time I saw The Nun on screen I couldn't help but jump they do reveal the real name of this demon in the movie but I don't really want to spoil that the thing about Bill Wilkins was enough. Anyways I do like this movie and I think there should be a 3rd one this definitely great to me this is one of the new necessary sequels I felt they needed to add more to this the first one wasn't enough for me after I saw that I did want more I really did. I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it."
"MaximumMadness","8","0","1","2 October 2016"," Though it's never quite as chilling as its predecessor, ""The Conjuring 2"" excels nonetheless thanks to James Wan's grand visuals and a surprisingly heartwarming story.
","Whodathunk that one of the biggest highlights of director James Wan's stellar sequel ""The Conjuring 2"" was not one of the dreaded jumps that the movie relishes in... nor the creaking of a doorway in the distance... nor the eerie music that chills you to the bone... but rather, a pleasant little scene where a man tries to bring a little happiness and joy to a family by plucking the strings of a guitar and singing ""I Can't Help Falling in Love with You"" with a smirking Elvis impression?<br/><br/>Yes, it may almost seem counter-intuitive, but the thing that's so admirable about ""The Conjuring 2"" is that it sees past the clichés and tropes of the standard horror sequel, and instead places its main focus first and foremost on creating a grounded scenario that audiences can identify with and populating its story with loving and thoughtful characters that you can't help but root for, while the horror elements frequently take a back seat.<br/><br/>Based on yet another of the Warren's case files (though obviously heavily exaggerated and embellished for the sake of drama... this ain't a documentary), the film moves the focus to London, taking inspiration from the famous and infamous Enfield Poltergiest case. Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren must help a distraught mother (Frances O'Connor) who is struggling with a deranged, seemingly supernatural force that threatens to tear her and her children apart- in particular young daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe), who seems to be this dark force's main target... However, the growing media firestorm surrounding the case, questions of whether or not Janet is faking the haunting, and a recurring premonition of Ed's death may prove that this case could be too much for the famed supernatural investigators...<br/><br/>A huge part of the appeal of the original film was the absolutely magical chemistry between stars Wilson and Farmiga, and this is only improved upon in the sequel. The duo really do light up the screen together, creating a wonderful set of leads for the audience to follow. Wolfe is a revelation of a child actress, and is both adorable and highly convincing in her role. O'Connor gives a satisfying and compelling turn as a mother in desperate need. And supporting roles by the likes of Simon McBurney and Franka Potente are well cast and deliver good, memorable performances.<br/><br/>Director James Wan excels here. Quickly becoming one of the finest filmmakers working in the world of horror today, Wan is an expert at delivering the goods. His expert sense of atmosphere and complex camera-work work wonders at building a sense of all encompassing dread that helps the horror to really hit home. But he's also grown quite a bit with the other material, having learned and honed his skills at telling thoughtful and sensitive scenes that help to develop the characters and story in such a delightful way. I've been a fan of his since way back when the original ""Saw"" hit theaters, and I'm glad I've stuck with his work. It's been a pleasure to see him grow and mature as a storyteller over the past twelve years and I look forward to his next projects.<br/><br/>The script by Wan, Chad Hayes, Carey W. Hayes and David Leslie Johnson is just a blast of pure fun. The four writers really have a good grasp on structure, pacing and balance. It's carefully crafted to not only give many strong punctuation's of scares and thrills, but to expertly develop the characters. As I mentioned above, even to points where the horror elements often take a backseat. But I didn't mind. In creating such a delightful setting and characters, it makes the horror hit harder. The group also really knows how to create memorable foes, with the new demonic forces at play being absolutely bone-chilling in their execution.<br/><br/>However, despite the gushing, I must also address a few of the film's minor faults. To start, even though the horror elements at play do generally work... it never quite comes off as chilling or as frightening as the original. It's almost more intriguing and interesting than it is scary. I also think that there were a few scares early on that do fall flat, feeling like wasted screen time that could have been spent elsewhere. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't notice the film's overlong runtime a bit. It could have used a bit more refining.<br/><br/>But those faults being said, ""The Conjuring 2"" is still a completely enthralling and engrossing thriller. Not only a solid sequel, but just a darned fine movie in its own right. Another win for director James Wan. Here's to hoping we get a ""Conjuring 3"" that continues to maintain the high quality of the previous installments!<br/><br/>I give it a very good 8 out of 10."

","A film that reinvigorates an entire genre and keeps horror alive on the big screen to scare us all. <br/><br/>The horror genre has been far from my favourite over the last 10 years with the passing of greats like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th giving way to many, many terrible reincarnations of what filmmakers think is considered scary and worthy of praise. Lots of 'jump scares' and bad CGI monsters later we finally seem to have found a winning formula in The Conjuring. <br/><br/>The scares make you jump, the monsters look frightening and certain scenes are incredibly tense and terrifying. But for me the film truly succeeds in the other elements that make it complete. Comedic moments that are genuinely funny, a great storyline focusing on love, family and getting on with life and that's just between Ed and Lorraine. <br/><br/>Overall one of the best horror films of the generation and with everything it tries it accomplishes, not without its faults but The Conjuring series offers a non loving horror fan plenty of storyline, tension and entertainment to make it a truly great film."

","I may be the only one here with this viewpoint, but I did not care for it one bit. It's got lots of style, for sure, but it's nothing more than a hodge podge of styles lifted from other movies and then failing to do anything unique with the lot of them.<br/><br/>I did like the first one much more, it felt realer compared to this. They took the bigger is better route on this one, every set piece, every scare feels manufactured by virtue of being over the top with effects which to be sure, would have benefited by having taken down a notch. Kind of reaching a bit with the kid audience. I've them what they want, but not everyone wants TWICE THE THRILLS, want more innovation and genuine horror."

It wasn't as good as the part I & even more - it was disappointing & not scary at all. And there was one mistake which ruined whole movie for me. They saw lots of evidence: moving objects in the house, bite on the hand of mother when she and Ed were in the water of basement & most of all, biggest evidence - face of that girl with unusual eyes & veins on her eyes & speaking with male voice (in short obvious possession signs) and after that, they say it was fake, girl was pretending, because they saw on the camera how she broke some chairs and objects. lol I can't believe how they made such a big mistake in movie. You must be really blind and dumb to ignore all these things and say it was fake & leave them. This moment ruined whole movie.

And on top of it, it has that charm of the horror films of the 80s, before gore and silly monsters took center stage.<br/><br/>However, it's not quite The Ring. I'm sorry if i have to be dismissive .. this is a really good film. It's really that i'm no good at judging horror films. <br/><br/>Actually, that's not quite true.<br/><br/>See, for example; i love the film The Ring. I would recommend everyone to watch it, because the way the story is built, the writing choices that were made, make it into a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The Conjuring is not like that; it's a classic, old-skool scary-stuff film. It goes through the motions, instead of breaking new ground. It does so masterfully, and it's a pleasure to watch, but the scary stuff kinda gets in the way of everything else. It's really the same story as The Amityville Horror - and also of every scare-jump film made in the past 20 years. <br/><br/>So, here is my advice: if you are into horror films, go immediately to watch this awesome film. On the other hand, if you are not, then skip it. I cannot repeat enough times how well made this film is (aside from a single really bad CGI use), but you would probably get annoyed at the horror bits more than you are amused by the production.<br/><br/>i'm having a hard time vote this film properly, but i would give it at least 8/10 - incredibly well done."

","After enjoying the first installment I was expecting to be let down with the sequel of the conjuring; lets face it that's usually the case. However I loved every minute of The Conjuring 2 from the get go. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson really held this movie together; the chemistry between them was believable and the acting superb. I'm from the UK and at an age where I remember the story causing hype in the media. I've seen the documentary's and other versions of this story in screen plays, but they always fell short of being authentic, especially with the set and backdrop of the era. However The Conjuring 2 does not fail to add every detail by showing just how decrepit and humble life on welfare was in London during this time. I love a good ghost story and this movie did not disappoint. I really hope there will be another Conjuring movie in the future, with the same leading actors. This movie is now in my top 3 scary movies of all time."

"the_bluesman","9","0","2","27 August 2016"," A genuinely creepy horror movie that re-imagines established conventions
","I'm impressed! 'The Conjuring 2' is a great movie! Although I had read good reviews beforehand, I was still a bit anxious if it could keep up the high standard that was set by the first part back in 2013. After the relatively weak 'Insidious 2' that was James Wan's most disappointing directorial effort to date in my opinion—which is quite surprising as it came out the same year as the 'The Conjuring'—I must admit I did have some doubts. Still, 'Furious 7' was a good movie and it directly precedes 'The Conjuring 2' in Wan's filmography as director, so I was looking forward to seeing it. In fact, most of Wan's directing is quite impressive and there is hardly a movie he directed that I would call a true failure. Before seeing 'The Conjuring 2,' the two Wan movies that I rated highest were 'Saw' (2004) and 'Death Sentence' (2007). That has changed now. I think 'The Conjuring 2' is his most impressive directorial effort to date.<br/><br/>It is better than the first part—which was already good—and one of only a few horror movies I have seen in recent years that I would call genuinely creepy. It's quite an achievement to make a horror movie that runs for a whopping 134 minutes that doesn't have any lengths in it and never gets boring. James Wan did that and much more. 'The Conjuring 2' harks back to a number of classics in the horror genre like 'Poltergeist' (1982), 'The Amityville Horror' (1979), 'The Exorcist' (1973), and 'The Sixth Sense' (1999), but does not actually copy them. Wan merely uses a number of the most effective scare tactics that were introduced in those movies but adapts them in his own unique way so that they appeal to a modern audience that has already seen everything. Because of the established settings and well-known scary elements you'd expect to see in this kind of horror movie, 'The Conjuring 2' feels very familiar and I had a sense of déjà vu at certain points in the movie. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie does never feel clichéd because Wan is a very creative director who takes inspiration from classic horror movies but never dully imitates them like so many modern-day horror movies do. It's obvious that James Wan knows the horror genre very well and he knows how to effectively re-imagine its conventions and play with established tactics. The first half of the movie is especially eerie with its very effective use of shadows and sounds. I found the sound design done by Eliot Connors and Peter Staubli to be exceptional: Creaking doors, squeaky floors, pattering rain, low ringing bells in the night and all that make for a really spine-chilling atmosphere. Moreover, James Wan's direction is pretty much flawless and Don Burgess' cinematography is impressive. There are a couple of tracking shots in the movie that simply look amazing. The whole cast led by the delightful Vera Farmiga is great, too.<br/><br/>What I really love is when directors have an eye for small details in their movies and truly care about seemingly unimportant scenes that don't contribute to the plot but are still crucial as to how an audience perceives a movie. James Wan is such a director. In 'The Conjuring 2,' there is one scene in which Patrick Wilson's character Ed Warren brings a copy of Elvis' 'Blue Hawaii' soundtrack album to the Hodgson house because it was mentioned earlier that the kids' father took his Elvis collection with him when he left the family and the kids loved to listen to it. He puts the record on the turntable and everyone who knows Elvis' music will expect to get to hear the classic song 'Can't Help Falling in Love' now... but the turntable is broken! ""What a bummer,"" I think, but then Patrick Wilson grabs an acoustic guitar that just stands there in the corner, sits down on the edge of an armchair, and delivers a pretty good impromptu take on the song with the kids chiming in at the end. ""Great,"" I think, ""but it would have been nice to hear at least a bit of Elvis' original version when they show the record and its cover so prominently in the movie. Oh well."" Because of all the creepy stuff that is then going on in the movie, I completely forget about the song, and when Ed stores the Crooked Man music box away after the finale, and I hear those familiar, haunting lines ""like a river flows, surely to the sea"" from afar, I'm just as surprised as Ed. Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) put a copy of 'Blue Hawaii' on the turntable and the movie ends with her and Ed dancing to ""Can't Help Falling in Love."" I have heard this fantastic song hundreds of times but it's like hearing a familiar song in a completely new way when it's used so skillfully in a movie. A great way to end a great movie. Actually, I would have expected the movie to end differently with some kind of creepy shot suggesting that evil still lurks around the corner, but James Wan is not a director who bothers with those clichés.<br/><br/>So, to put it in a nutshell, this is a very well-made movie that no horror fan should miss."

","I love this movie. After watching the first Conjuring movie, I was left amazingly satisfied. When I heard that a sequel was coming, I couldn't miss it for the world! I was interested in quenching the thirst I had from the first movie. I watched the movie at the cinema with my friend and we had a blast. The movie exceeded my expectations. It left me so scared I had trouble shoving the images out of my head at night. I probably had a few nightmares about it too. I can't remember, but I know I was scared beyond the shadow of a doubt. I know this because before we watched I told my friend how I hate it when girls scream in a theater, and I became exactly that. I was so humiliated and it was fun. I had to stop watching horror movies for a while. Yep, it's that awesome!"

Well directed, well acted and very well scared :D . <br/><br/>No blood shed,nothing brutal or violent but sheer thrill and suspense as to how it would turn out in the end along with good spine chilling scary scenes and BGM good enough to keep you at the edge.A kind of movie that wont scare anyone when going to sleep :P <br/><br/>Possibly the best horror movie i have seen.

","A thoroughly enjoyable night out at the flicks. I saw the first film and loved it and I think I might have enjoyed this sequel even more and whats-more, the screening I went to of this was absolutely still and silent - James Wan had the audience in the palm of his hand which is exactly the way it should be.<br/><br/>Wan takes everything you loved about the first film and turns the volume up a couple of more notches. The set design, script, acting and scare scenes are all uniformly masterful. My only criticism would be that it was a tad long and the middle section of the film could have been trimmed down a bit; we reach a point as an audience where we feel that the setup has been established for the final act and we want to move into the final movement of the film but Wan lingers a bit too long and shows us one too many possession scenes I think. This is a minor criticism though.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson deliver solid performances again and Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor (whom I enjoyed immensely in the excellent TV series The Missing) are also excellent. The scare set pieces are fantastic with the early scene of the demon visiting Lorraine at home being one of the best horror scenes in years. Great music and atmosphere and I was pleased to see that Wan even kept the creepy ascending yellow title scroll from the first film.<br/><br/>9/10. Loses one point for being slightly too long."

","One of the greatest horror movies I have ever watched. Still cannot decide which part is better, first or this one. If you are true horror fan, you will enjoy every minute of 2 hours! Excellent and convincing story in the background (not something often seen in the horror movies), perfect acting followed by nicely developed characters and lots, but really lots of scary scenes. I have a feeling that scary scenes are brought to the new, higher level. While watching the movie, there is almost no space where you can relax a bit and feel no tension at all. Even during the daylight scenes you don't feel safe in your seat! Something rarely seen in the horror movies. I just like the way how shoots are made and how camera moves. Everything seems so natural, almost like you are participating in the movie. Don't be fooled that you will feel more safe and not so frighten if you go to cinema in company, it doesn't help at all..Really, absolute horror classic!"

","Starting off with a compilation of what happened at the Amityville house it all looked fine. If you want to know what happened go watch the original one (1979). Once told we do move over to Enfiled Great Britain to see what is happening over there. Based on the real events late seventies at Enfield.<br/><br/>And again i was tricked or possessed by the trailers shown were people are really scared and are screaming. Been in the genre almost 35 years I thought, could it be as scary as The Exorcist (1973). Sadly it wasn't.<br/><br/>What it does is again having a lot of jump scene's and creepy voices but even as I did like part 1 this one couldn't satisfy my hunger.<br/><br/>Some parts I did enjoy and of course children being possessed do offer something weird but it's so typical James Wan so you know what to expect and you do know what is going to happen like a ghost passes by in a slow and creepy way. For example the painting coming alive, mmm, didn't work for me. Or the crosses being turned upside down...<br/><br/>What The Exorcist did I haven't seen yet.

"rebeccahenzwaffen","9","0","2","26 July 2016"," Subtle but filled me criteria
","Another movie I saw at the theaters, at first I didn't expect anything from this movies even though the first one was very good, but, as every other sequence it had only two ways to go, kind of good or really bad. As the movie started with a very subtle psychological horror flick it caught my complete attention to the screen, the art and camera direction where completely stunning I can't find a single reason to not watch it, at least, for the art itself. The usage of a not really known character like the crooked man was a good shot, the personification was a bit iffy but I can't complain about it since it wasn't the real ""monster"" in question, but you wouldn't know that until the middle of the movie, I though it was weird that they only revealed the real monster at the almost end of the movie and yet left a bunch of little clues from start to end (for example the dreams with the nun and Valak's name in a bunch of earlier scenes), in my vision the usage of a nun didn't make much sense and wanting it or not, they didn't truly explain why Valak took the figure of a nun. But at the end I did enjoy the movie for it's art in a whole, I would totally recommend it for those of you who like good art directions (like me) and horror movie scripts in general."

I'm never one to jump at everything 'scary' I see in movies as usually you've seen it all before & let's be honest, nothing really scares you much when your not a teenager anymore. However The Conjuring had me jumping all over the place. At one point I even yelped, much to my embarrassment, but that's why we go to horror movies! To be scared & the conjuring didn't disappoint. All actors gave amazing performances & the story had you never in a state of boredom. Walking out of the cinema I couldn't wait to see what The Conjuring 3 would bring! (Assuming we're lucky enough for another). Definitely a movie to see in the cinema. I give it 10/10!! Great movie!!"

I didn't think they could do it again, but they did! I have been a fan of the true Ed and Lorraine Warren my entire life. Following their cases can keep the Conjuring movies going strong for years to come and every one of them would be as good as the first one.

","The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case is a superb horror flick that we have been waiting for so long.<br/><br/>THE CONJURING 2 DIRECTION James Wan's affair with scare continues to give you eerie chills. He seems to have mastered the art of going ""Boo!"" at people. Five minutes glimpse into the life of Ed and Lorraine and it doesn't feel like it's been three years since the first one showed up. Your wounds find another gash and lo you are living a nightmare again.<br/><br/>The director uses spine-tingling motion to follow every still act, unlike conventional movies and ends up acing ""every moment"". You feel as if you are living it. Rambling up and down the house, it feels like you are walking in the shoes of the protagonist of the frame. It creeps you out beyond limit to feel unpredictable terror. The fact that formidable moments aren't placed at junctures where you might expect them, makes his horror stories one of a kind.<br/><br/>INCESSANT HORROR So, the unexpected happens, in every frame. So beautiful is its editing that you don't really feel at any point the movie losing its winsome charm. One moment you are scampering to come out from a short heart-attack then boom! comes another. That's how the terror is bestrewn all across The Enfield case.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 walks in with an extraordinary séance to drop off scare bombs one by one in a gorgeous fashion. The fact that its plot finds the light from a true story makes you question the veracity of it all. But hey! It's a horror movie, and it succeeds in what it set out to achieve in the first place.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson still stays as one of the most powerful actors with his thoughtful mien as he bides by his consumed acting prowess. He goes full-blown enchanting, well supported at all times by the ever so brilliant actress Vera Farmiga. They both complete each other in every sense.<br/><br/>To say The Conjuring 2 only had thrills would be an understatement. It is a perfect blend of everything, from thoughtful melodrama to unpredictable story twists, and an enthralling climax that will have you bite your nails spotless.<br/><br/>SPOILER OUIJA BOARD AHEAD: The part where Lorraine begs Ed to not venture without her is the most dramatic bit. Her constant apprehension to save him from harm's way will have you feeling sorry for her. Also, you cannot overlook Janet Hodgson, played stunningly by Madison Wolfe. She is simply mind-blowing with her acting. There is so much drama lodged in her that she will rivet you from the moment you set eyes on her. One of the best parts is when Peggy opens up to Lorraine about how her life has drastically changed.<br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine's appeasement in The Conjuring 2 will throw you in stark majestic awe. Both stay as the most noteworthy characters ever created. They have a chemistry that is outright unrivalled. Their immense love for each other, the way they try to console the afflicted, their staying over acts to see to it that others are comfortable around, and their intense care for affected families will leave you wondering how beautiful their souls must be in reality.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is a definite go-go if you need something thrillinger supernatural to topple you down from your seats.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com"

Some of the gags come a bit out of nowhere, but overall the atmosphere is great.

","A ghostbusting couple decides to give it a rest after a demon comes too close, but are drawn irresistibly across the Atlantic by the cries for help from an English family haunted by the spirit of an old man, where things get even closer.<br/><br/>Hectic story that rolls out all the tricks to reasonable effect. While Wan does put bums on seats, he's considered a bit safe and does the expected here. But there is some edge to this standard story of puberty possession, with violent entities piercing through the shadows with demonic intent. Early on the scares come through sound jumps, but the visual weirdness takes over and delivers some good stuff.<br/><br/>The acting is good, particularly the wife. There is one afterthought scene before the third act, which starts with a false line about taking the music away and develops into a decent tribute to Elvis while failing to deliver any horror effect. That's probably the biggest blip in the pacing of a story that doesn't have enough psychological strength or coherent demon myth to outrun 100 mins.<br/><br/>The Christian angle would be nauseating, except there's no sincerity and it fizzles out with maudlin reassurance for the teen audience.The English accents are from drama school, although there is a fair attempt at setting the contemporary scene from 1977 - not sure Maggie called herself the Iron Lady until two years later.<br/><br/>Sound design early on was interesting, but after that it's mostly Scorsese-style dropping in of popular old tunes that sets the tone.<br/><br/>Overall, more robust from Wan but still safe as houses.

"christopherbreen","8","0","2","16 July 2016"," Visionary director James Wan instills fear of all types in this superior sequel
","Now, I must say I was reluctant to see this movie, because I obviously get scared by horror movies (dur) and the only sessions were at 9:40pm every night... But, I knew my audience would want it, and so I gritted my teeth, and stepped into the movie theater. I hope you guys know the sacrifices I make for you!<br/><br/>But I walked out of the theater very impressed. I don't have LOADS of horror movie experience, but what I do know is that most of them have one priority only- to scare the audience. While this was definitely present in this movie, I was pleasantly surprised at how layered and intricate the plot and characters were. Australia's own James Wan directed this movie and I must give a standing ovation for the job he did here. Bravo. I don't think I trust many other horror directors aside from him. The cinematography of this film was genius and flawlessly executed, and was probably the scariest part of the movie! The use of wide shots and a slowly panning camera back and forth from a source of horror was brilliant! And this was fantastically complimented by the set design, extensive use of props, and the eerie and enigmatic lighting. Roughly half the time something would emerge from the darkness or from behind the props, while the other half of the time, nothing would happen, but the anticipation was what scared viewers. I would not be surprised if Wan or the cinematography team were nominated for an Oscar. Look out for the scene where Janet is being interviewed by Ed Warren- the camera-work really shines there, you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>And that wasn't the only source of fright for viewers. It just didn't stop throughout almost the entire movie. By the end, however, it kind of lost its initial effect. Maybe I just became more acclimatized to it. And of course I have to address the biggest cliché plot convenience in all horror films- walking TOWARDS the source of the horror. Why? Just why? There was one scene however when an entire family, after being scared enough, sprinted out of their house to the neighbors next door. I thought 'that was the most sensible thing anyone has done in a horror movie'. Anyway, to the plot! I did like the spin they put on that the whole thing could be a hoax concocted by a bored girl (which was an element present in the true story of this case), and exploring that from different perspectives. It's something that the world deals with all the time- skepticism. And that element was used deftly in a plot twist that invigorated the story line when it needed it most. For those wondering, the actual events of this case are dramatized significantly to make the finished product. I've seen the real evidence, and I'm still not convinced that any of it was real. The poignant tone at the end of the Conjuring movies is something that I both hate and like at the same time. Yes, it gives the franchise some originality, brings some themes to the table, and makes the plot more intricate, but at the end of the day, this is a HORROR MOVIE. I want to walk out of the cinema shaking, but the 'and they lived happily ever after' takes some of that away. That's where I feel a franchise like Paranormal Activity trumps The Conjuring.<br/><br/>The cast has familiar faces Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, with new guys Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor, Lauren Esposito, Benjamin Haigh, Patrick McAuley, Simon McBurney, Maria Doyle Kennedy, and Simon Delaney among others. Not many horror films have names you might recognize. Farmiga's and Wolfe's performances were the stand-outs in this movie, with the ensemble cast performing valiantly as well. Wilson and his character were a bit too fearless for me. I loved Wilson and Farmiga's cute chemistry. It was a nice, light element to bring to the table. Speaking of, genres included action, horror, thriller, mystery, and romance, while themes were family, unity, incredulity, and the media. The costuming and production value was done well, and special effects were fine except for the 'Crooked man' sequence (contained animation)- not sure I liked that very much...<br/><br/>The running time was pretty long, but it felt like a journey because of the character development and how I was engaged. The soundtrack and sound editing was effective in the way it was intelligently used, and a sequel is definitely possible- the Warrens have a fair amount of source material to draw from. You don't need to have seen the original or Annabelle to enjoy this one, but you will have a greater appreciation of it if you have.<br/><br/>To conclude, it could be improved through less of a happy ending- even if its just one shot at the end or the possibility of a reawakening force, and more thriller elements- in terms of the villains credibility- to really solidify the fear in the audience. But, I judge a good movie on how it stimulates emotions, and there were definitely some emotions brewing inside me!<br/><br/>For more reviews like this; see chrisbreviews.blogspot.com"

","The first film was a big hit scary movie, the spin-off prequel Annabelle was a bit disappointing, and I was looking forward to this critically higher rated sequel, directed by James Wan (Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious). Basically set in 1977, Peggy Hodgson (Bedazzled's Frances O'Connor) lives with her children Janet (Madison Wolfe), Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Johnny (Patrick McAuley) and Billy (Benjamin Haigh) live in Enfield, London, England. One night, Janet is conversing with an unseen entity who claims that the house is his, soon all the siblings and Peggy witness paranormal activities for themselves, with the spirit attacking them they are forced to take refuge with their neighbours. The Hodgsons' create a media storm with their claims that their house is haunted, paranormal investigators Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney) and Anita Gregory (Creep's Franka Potente) are brought in to help, Janet is possessed by the spirit of Bill Wilkins, an elderly man who previously lived and died in the house, he wants his house back. The story of the haunting eventually reaches noted demonologists Ed (Insidious's Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Orphan's Vera Farmiga), who a year ago were investigating the Lutz family and the murders and demonic occurrences in Amityville, New York, who come to London to help the case. Lorraine fears for Ed's life, as she had a premonition of his death, he promises they will only document, they consult Maurice and Anita on the legitimacy of the case, they also attempt to talk to Wilkins spirit in attempt to stop him harassing the family. One night a possessed Janet is caught on video wrecking the kitchen, the Warrens are convinced the haunting is a prank, but they change their minds when they find out Wilkins is only a pawn, being manipulated to haunt Janet, the true mastermind is a demonic nun, who Lorraine has seen in her visions. The Warrens return to the Hodgson's house, Janet is possessed, lightning strikes a tree outside the house, leaving a stump that resembles what impales Ed in Lorraine's premonition of his death. Ed stops the possessed Janet jumping out the window and committing suicide, but they are near to falling with the curtain he is holding to tearing, Lorraine remembers that the demon's name is Valak, she confronts and addresses it by name, successfully condemning it to Hell, Janet is freed from possession, and Lorraine saves her and Ed from falling. The end of the film tells that Peggy lives in the house until her death, where she was found sitting in the same chair Wilkins died in, Ed adds the ""The Crooked Man"" zoetrope toy from the house to his collection, alongside the music box and Annabelle the doll in the case. Also starring Maria Doyle Kennedy as Peggy Nottingham, Simon Delaney as Vic Nottingham, Sterling Jerins as Judy Warren. Bob Adrian as Bill Wilkins, Robin Atkin Downes as Demon Voice, Bonnie Aarons as Demon Nun, Javier Botet as Crooked Man and Steve Coulter as Father Gordon. The cast all do well, especially Wilson and Farmiga as the real-life ghostbusters, Wilson's highlight is an Elvis Presley impression singing ""Can't Help Falling in Love"", this works even better than the original film, the jump scares with loud noises and things suddenly appearing are much more effective,, and a tense score by Joseph Bishara, a really scary and splendid supernatural horror. Very good!"

","The Conjuring 2 was a pretty decent horror movie. As far as horror movies about paranormal activity goes, this is probably the best one. Having said this, its debatable that the first Conjuring was just as good. In my eyes, it wasn't any better than the first one, but not any worse either. <br/><br/>Some scenes were really good and scary, such as the first scene, and some were quite predictable. There were more good scenes than bad ones though. WARNING: Do not watch this if it is your first horror movie. I also think if you are going to watch this movie you should be either a 16+ or an experienced horror movie watcher, as you should be for most horror movies.<br/><br/>Like in the first movie of The Conjuring, it says it is based on a true story. They only say this to scare you. It is true that there were people who heard strange noises in there homes, but so do we all. Plus, they never found out where the noises were coming from and in this movie there is a lot more than just noises.<br/><br/>Considering it is a a movie about paranormal activity , and those movies don't normally scare me because they are unrealistic, this one is fairly scary. It was a good quality movie with good graphics and an obvious amount of effort put in to the making. The only disappointing thing, for me, was the bad story line and especially the ending, which I thought was quite poor and rushed."

","I have to admit ,the Conjuring 2 is one of the best movies I've ever watched.I wasn't so impressed by The Conjuring 1,even though it was pretty interesting. But the Conjuring 2 has been very well directed and has a good case for a movie. The movie is so real,it's like we are watching the case from a first hand. I like the fact that the movie actually defines ""Paranormal"" in the movie and actions, for example,when The Hodgson family is at their neighbor's house,and the dog touches the small bell,and the dog transforms into The Old Crooked Man,from the Spirit,Called Balak. I like how the movie directs scary scenes,and makes them scary without making them fake,for example when Lorain is in the room with Balak the spirit,and Balak is hiding behind her own portrait and using it to cover her face. Lastly,I like how the movie isn't only about horror and spirits,and it's also about different theories that could exist in real life,For Example when there was a theory that Janet was faking all this.Or when ,Billy the Grandpa was just used by Balak to cover herself,so they couldn't recognize what was happening straight away was by her.

","Huge props need to go to Aussie horror king James Wan. He had his big break with the mysteriously creepy gorefest Saw, which spawned a multitude of sequels that he also produced. He then went on to direct the films Insidious and The Conjuring – two films that breathed new life into the stale genre. After directing Insidious: Chapter 2 and producing the spin-off Annabelle, he is back at the helm of the next sequel The Conjuring 2.<br/><br/>In this instalment the focus lies on the Hodgson family, comprised of a single mum of four children who live in the suburb of North London called Enfield. What adds to the fear in this film is the fact that once again, it is based on true events as these hauntings became infamous all over England (and eventually worldwide) in the 70s. Ed and Lorraine Warren (reprised by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are summoned to investigate what appears to be a combination of a haunted house and the demon possession of a little girl.<br/><br/>Without revealing too much, certain scenes that used CGI immediately take you out of the film and therefore might dull the scare factor however this film is full of traditional scares and suspenseful moments that have you jumping out of your seat (I literally did jump out of my seat at one point!).<br/><br/>The cherry on this ghoulish cake is the fact that real imagery and audio is used throughout the end credits, almost as a friendly reminder that this stuff REALLY WENT DOWN.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the franchise, and of James Wan's work (as I am), then you're in for a deliciously scary treat.<br/><br/>motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com"

","The Sinister Synopsis: Six years following the infernal investigation of the Perron household haunting, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga, ""Bates Motel"") are back to take on a case more sinister than ever before. With evil making its way to the serene London community of Enfield, Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), a single mother of four, calls upon the Warrens' expertise in helping her youngest daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), overcome the perilous possession that's all too familiar for Ed and Lorraine. The only thing the Warrens don't realize is that they're dealing with an unprecedented power so cynical, that even their own vulnerability may get the very best of them. <br/><br/>The Diabolical Desire: Much like director James Wan's initial installment of ""The Conjuring"" (2013), there are plenty of positive qualities throughout. From the credibility of each and every character (especially Wilson and Farmiga, who never lost a single beat from their initial portrayal of our beloved demon experts), to the cinematography that sends a spine-tingling sensation all in its own artistic way. Having the supernatural sub-genre infamous for its heavy use of CGI, ""Conjuring 2"" wholeheartedly relies mainly on practical effects, most notably The Crooked Man, portrayed by Javier Botet, that seemingly looks computer generated, but is all the more natural with his creepy, spontaneous movements. Even the soundtrack carries an effective vibe from The Hollies' ""Bus Stop"" to Elvis Presley's ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" that's necessary for the film's time period (even Wilson's own cover of the song is quite plausible). <br/><br/>The Rancid Reaction: When it comes to the negative notations of the film, there's really not too much to indite into this department. Even for the film's 134-minute duration, the pace is just enough to keep you attentive on the horror that awaits. Also, like said before, even the film's lesser use of CGI and ""jumpy"" scare tactics actually works to its advantage, unlike the majority of attempts in its class. <br/><br/>The Axed Addendum: Another interesting point about the film is its homage to the notorious Amityville haunting. The intro recaps Wan's reincarnation of the malicious murders of Ronald DeFeo, and the subsequent haunting of the Lutz family where the Warrens dipped their toes into a nightmare deemed the most menacing of their encounters, until..."

","I love all the modern horror movies that are written like Conjuring, Annabelle, Sinister, and Insidious.<br/><br/>When I saw Conjuring 2 getting 7.9 stars on IMDb, I knew it would be a HUGE mistake for me to wait for it to come out on bluray. You usually only get one chance to see movies like this on the big screen.<br/><br/>It's almost unheard of for horror films to get rated that high. Now I know why so many people are loving this film. For me, this surpassed the original. And while it wasn't as scary for me as Insidious 1 or Sinister 1, the story itself is probably the strongest out of them. And there are plenty of great scares, special effects, and a totally original villain.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of slow burner horror. In fact, I generally try to avoid them because they are not exciting enough for me. At times during the first 30-40 minutes of this film, I got the feeling it was a slow burner. But as the story progressed, I reflected some more, and it's really not a slow burner. It's just such a well written story, that it creates a perfect balance between hardcore horror and slow burner character and plot development.<br/><br/>As the IMDb rating confirms, this is one horror film that satisfies most horror movie fans.<br/><br/>And If you are the type of person who gets teary eyed at emotionally moving scenes, fortunately for you, you might get a little waterworks going during this film.<br/><br/>This movie, as far as horror genre goes, is just perfect. It really deserves a 10/10. I wish people would stop reserving a 10/10 for some Holy Grail of a movie that will never be made. This folks, is what a 10/10 looks like. Enjoy."

","I very much enjoyed the first conjuring movie and expected a even better movie, which conjuring 2 isn't. But only cause of some little things, although it's like the first one one of the best horror- movies since 20 years. But there are a couple of things, which the first movie made better. First of all, it's not very nice to see the creepiest daemon in the first sequence, James Wan did everything right in the first movie, to not show the evil daemon til the end, this time, you know him almost since minute 1. Second thing not going right is the end. It's very constructed and not very logical. Why the hell is it the same daemon as in the amityville house, something you never get explained. Third thing not so right is the way the movie shoots with effects and jump-scares. I mean, nothing wrong with some nice effects and jump-scares, but less is more, a rule the first conjuring movie kept in mind. Although, the movie is also very scary cause of it's perfect dark atmosphere and the beautiful sets. I know, I criticized a lot of things, but don't get me wrong, its a very very good horror-movie and a lot better than most of the last horror-movies. It's sadly just not as good as the first one."

","What is true in the true story on which this film is based? People levitating, which violates the elementary law of gravity? I do not believe. That the furniture can move around the house all alone? That a dead man or a spirit can speak through the mouth of a living person? That people can go from one room into another through the floor, ceiling or walls? Or that a dead man can strangle a living person ? Chance makes that I've seen only with a few days interval in between, the Italian film ""Libido""(1965)(check my review) and this ""The conjuring 2"". I wrote about the Italian film (and many other films of the same genre) that ghosts make their presence felt only in the big houses of rich people. This ""The conjuring 2"" contradicts the theory, ghosts of the past come here to disturb the existence of a poor family from Enfield, London. Well, you got to see it yourself. But, I warn you, it's very disturbing. It's almost as good as ""The Exorcist""(1973), maybe even better, in terms of degree of fright. Arguably from other viewpoints, artistic achievement, subject, the difference between fiction and ""after a real case."""

","This was an unbelievably good movie, and not just a horror movie. It really is a story about the power of love and faith under the most dire and frightening circumstances. In fact, twice the movie was so intensely scary but also emotional that I actually teared up, and I'm usually pretty stoic in movies. <br/><br/>The story structure is really well done. You have two plots in the beginning, the English Hodgson family and the American demonologists, the Warrens. As the haunting is beginning to wreak havoc on the Hodgson family, the Warrens have become spiritually exhausted due to the evil they're constantly forced to confront. <br/><br/>What was different and brilliant about this movie was the use of doubt and skepticism. Most demon horror movies use the lame fallback of everyone disbelieving the besieged victim, and you're just irritated that no one is on the victim's side because it's so obvious they're not delusional or whatever. With this movie, they go to great lengths to demonstrate how meticulously the Warrens obtain proof and aren't just there on some crusade. <br/><br/>This added a great deal of plausibility for me, which made it so much more frightening. I haven't been this scared since I saw the first Conjuring movie."

","There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse, And they all lived together in a little crooked house.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is one of those rare squeals that wasn't terrible, but rather good. The squeal did a lot of things better than first film in terms of character's, the twist and the unpleasant atmosphere. But it's kinda rare that we get a squeal that's just as solid as it's predecessor with plenty of surprises under it's sleeve.<br/><br/>I have no idea how James Wan dose it. I seriously don't know how he manages to take the things that I usually can't stand in today's horror and somehow turn it into gold. That's why The Conjuring movies always stand out from the rest of the paranormal demonic movies, because movies like 'The Conjuring' actually have an atmosphere and characters with depth. Even the jump scars are effective and used at appropriate times. James Wan is the only director I can think of that I trust when it comes to directing horror movies, as he understands the genre well. Wan does it again here with tension that builds and the good old sense of death. <br/><br/>The acting from everyone was pretty damn solid. Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Frances O'Connor were all great in the movie. Even the littler girl (Madison Wolfe) was really good, as she actually looked terrified and it was a very convincing performance, even for a child actor in a horror movie. <br/><br/>What really surprised me about ""The Conjuring 2"" is that I actually did care for the character's. I mean, compared to some horror flicks that are somewhat similar to this, but with the character's that are forgettable and so boring to watch on screen. Luckily this movie had character's with emotional weight to them. <br/><br/>The camera work, the score and the cinematography are the highlights of this film. It also takes it's time and uses different ways to scare or spook you. It may not impress a lot of people, but I do admire the film markers for taking a risk like that. <br/><br/>Enfield haunting case has been a hot topic for years now with people debating if it's a hoax or not. And while the ""based on a true story"" may be bullsh*t (or just any movie that uses that headline for attention), I'm just so use to it now that it's getting numb. A lot people complained that this was too Hollywood or it was not accurate to the original story. I have seen plenty of documentary's and stories about the Enfield haunting case, and it's so BORING. I literally found nothing interesting about it and all the evidence for the paranormal haunting seemed a bit fake. I'm so glad this movie wasn't accurate to the original case that may or may not be real. The film markers took something with it and told a different story with events that's very loosely based on an actual case. <br/><br/>The problems that I had with this movie (which is not a lot) is the use of CG for scenes involving the Crooked Man. It took me out of the movie and it kinda took away the terror from the Crooked Man character that Wan beautifully created. And yes, Javier Botet (who is about 6' 6¾) plays the Crooked Man, but the CG is so noticeable when he starts jumping around or growing tall to scare the little girl that he's haunting. I think practical effect's would have been so much better and scarier.<br/><br/>Overall rating: The Conjuring 2 is a solid squeal that's way better then the avenge horror squeal. It takes your expectations and turns it completely around."
"pablo2896","9","0","2","30 June 2016"," Who you gonna call?
","In The Conjuring 2 a family of a single mother and four children, living in London, find themselves being haunted by an evil spirit. Because of their increasingly dire situation they decide to contact Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren who answer their aid call. So, James Wan! More like James Win, know what I'm saying? Because he directed this awesome movie? No? OK, sorry. In all seriousness I may have found my favorite horror movie with The Conjuring 2. That's not saying much, as I am not that educated in horror movies but this film showed me that in order to create horror there must be no shortage in creativity and practicality. I've heard people saying that crafting a horror movie must be easier than other genres but this movie proves the opposite. Director James Wan injects his film with horror through some of the most elaborate visual techniques I have witnessed in a movie from this genre. From the simple use of shadows to the use of decoys in the shot that only want to trick our focus, Wan plays with our senses in almost every sequence. You are always left examining every aspect of the environment where the characters are in order to guess where the next horrifying thing will jump from next; and at times it is so obvious that you are left squinting your eyes and cringing waiting for the jump scare to take the color out of your skin. From POV shots to elaborate tracking shots, the variety of filming techniques is also astonishing. Wan's excellent directing also tackles the sound category. Every knock and every squeak serves a purpose and enhances the atmosphere. <br/><br/>In the following I am going to do a very spoilery commentary about to sequences which raised all of my body hair and turned me into a chicken-skinned porcupine, but at the same time made me admire James Wan as a horror director. The first sequence I want to mention is the one where Ed Warren contacts the spirit of Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian) through Janet (Madison Wolfe). Ed is facing the camera and his back is facing Janet, who is sitting on a couch. The camera very cleverly maintains focus on Ed and through the use of depth of field distorts the image of Janet. As Ed begins to interview the spirit and this entity starts to answer in a very crooked voice, Janet begins to shift very subtly into an old man. This isn't implemented as a jump scare but as a ""Holy crap! Look look look!"" moment. As you maintain your focus in Ed Warren and Patrick Wilsons great performance the oddity slowly and almost unnoticeably starts to manifest. What's incredible is that the scene lasts about 4 minutes. Wan's complete trust in Wilson's performance and in our attention as an audience is baffling. He has no need of hammering in the fear factor; he trusts that our attention and perception will do the job for him. The other sequence I will delve in switches subtlety for the most horrifying character that will haunt my dreams until I drown it with many sessions of watching colorful cartoons and sitcoms that will dry my tears and keep me from reluctantly waiting for that face to pop out of a window at night. Trust me it really is that scary. And if you've watched it you know what I am talking about. Yes, that nun (Bonnie Aarons) is the stuff of nightmares. The makeup and character design is one of the best I have seen in a horror film, probably on par with The Exorcist. It is much simpler but damn that crap brings the crap. But back to the sequence, man was it bone-chilling. Lorraine following the nun into that room and then the way in which the film plays with us through shadows and the shape of the nun's face, damn damn damn. I really wanted to look away as the nun's face just sat there in the dark, and I think I used all of my cringe faces in that single sequence alone. That is true mastery in film design. The film also included some amazing musical choices. All of those Christmas carols that played as the nun's background music were chilly but also pretty epic. But music wasn't always used to enhance the chills but also to bring some heart into the film. ""Can't help falling in love"" was used to gather our characters in moments of tranquility which made the pace much more tolerable. <br/><br/>The characters were also quite tolerable for a horror movie. They obviously included the kid who wandered out into the darkness alone in spite of all the spookiness that had happened and made us question why he didn't have at least 7 people accompanying him with all the lights on. But all of the characters in general where entertaining to watch and the family and the Warrens had enough character development for us to care about their survival. The awesome performances, especially from Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Madison Wolfe also helped the movie become very digestible. <br/><br/>Although I truly admire this film I do have a few negatives to point out. Firstly, there is a tall and silly monster called the Crooked Man that makes sudden appearances and it just feels very out of place given his very over the top and colorful design. <br/><br/>All things considered, The Conjuring 2 is a true masterwork in horror. It is very uncommon for a sequel to be as good as the original, but in my case this movie surpassed the first one because of some extremely clever filming and storytelling techniques. I am thrilled to experience all of James Wan's upcoming projects and I am confident that he has the ability inflict some very intelligent thrills into us audience members. I am rating The Conjuring 2 with a 9 out of 10."

","This movie is fantastic. I went with my boyfriend too see the Conjuring 2 and both of us were so nervous that we thought the beginning of Marvel trailer was a horror movie. Everything about this movie is fantastic. It is definitely the scariest movie I have ever seen, I had chills the whole time and the whole experience was so nerve wrecking. This movie had so many scary moments, the possessed nun, the crooked man, Bill and man I did not like that chair or that tent. Despite the many scary and crazy moments in this movie, my favorite scene was when Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) was singing Can't help falling in love. It was a nice change from all of the craziness. And when the movie was over my boyfriend and I we're so ready to get out of there. We were the only ones left in there and when we were walking out my boyfriend said, ''I'm not looking back.'' We were walking out when an even scarier music starting playing in the credits and we just ran out like we were running for our lives. But I definitely recommend this movie, it's fantastic, it's scary and James Wan really knows how to make a scary movie!"
"budgetbabecouture","6","0","2","29 June 2016"," Much Better Than The First But Still Not In Love
","Everyone was going on about this one being better than the first so tonight I went. The first one wasn't even the least bit scary to me. This one does have quite a few more scares, but they are all jump scares. My biggest dislike was the movie ended quite abruptly when it shouldn't have because it drug on for two hours and then when the actual climax occurs it lasts a good 10 seconds and boom the end. Since that was the entire point of the movie it made no sense whatsoever for the scene to only last 10 seconds. So I'll totally give it credit for jump scares and for the cast including awesome Franka Potente (she's in awesome German films), but it is one of those films that could have been so much better."
"jollyjockey99","7","0","2","28 June 2016"," Fantastic horror film that stands out from the modern day crowd
","In my opinion, many horror films today lack depth and meaning in their films. This is why the Conjuring is good; it stands out as a truly scary horror film that uses more than just jump scares to entice the audience. The film's excellent cinematography creates a brilliant atmosphere that truly engrosses the audience in the film, the performances are great with the children in the film not being incredibly cringe-worthy, the lighting and special effects are superb (bar one specific part that I will talk about later) and the story is rather well written.<br/><br/>As well as this, I believe it's safe to say that The Conjuring 2 could be viewed without seeing the first film. That being said, having watched the first film and other films set in that universe (such as Anabelle) can help to create a better understanding for the audience.<br/><br/>While the film is technically excellent, there are a few things that let the film down(Bear in mind that the events in the film are based upon the Enfield haunting in Enfield, London). For example, there are some plot lines that can seem quite confusing for the audience; there are 2 different plot lines at the beginning that eventually merge and become one (the Warrens in the US and the Hodgson family in London) Sometimes the transition can seem confusing; it often feels like two different films with the Warrens having completely different experiences to the Hodgsons. This is eventually tied together, albeit quite loosely. There is no real explanation as to why (Spoilers form here)...<br/><br/>...Valak, the main demon in the film, ""possesses""/uses the old man as a pawn to haunt the Hodgsons, they just seem to be used together, despite the fact that they are situated in completely different places. As well as this, there is a second demon with the Hodgsons in the form of The Crooked Man. There seems to be so much more that can be done with this character that isn't explored, it seems as if it's there and then suddenly isn't (this may be a way of hinting at a separate film with the crooked man. Another issue with the crooked man is the fact that he is neither CGI or Mocapped, but rather an animated clay figure. While this does look incredibly creepy, it seems to break some immersion a bit. It is easy to tell it's clay animation which doesn't really fit the theme of the rest of the film. The clay animation isn't used very often, however, which is worth noting Overall, The Conjuring 2 is an excellent sequel and a fantastic horror film. I would definitely recommend watching the film, whether you're aware of The Conjuring or any story relating to the Warrens, this film is an enjoyable experience and gives the audience a few good scares."

","I saw conjuring 1 back in 2013. Up until that point, I had yet to see any good American horror films (Asian ones are the best for you ghost movie fans). The conjuring 1 was a difference maker and completely changed my attitude towards American horror films.<br/><br/>Fast forward 3 years, I was extremely excited when the Conjuring 2 was about to release, and I had very high expectations. The movie smashed my expectation in every way, which is amazing in itself. There were many good things about the film, however, one thing stood out:<br/><br/>This is the only ghost movie I remember, and I have seen many as a big fan of the genre since I was before 10, which featured a male ghost that is not a 10 year old boy, and he was scary. Up until now I thought only little boys and women can be ghosts.<br/><br/>Other than that, the plot featured a very good twist at the end, which I will not spoil. <br/><br/>Great movie! If you are a horror movie film fan, this is a must see. If you are curious about the genre, this is still a must-see. There are many bad movies in this genre (Just look at the average rating of most movies), and this one is one-of-a-kind. I hope there will be a Conjuring 3 sometime in the near future."

","Conjuring 2 goes back to the roots of horror movies. Yes you have classic horror movie clichés and plot twists. But this movie does these clichés at the peak of their level. <br/><br/>Based of a real life event (Enfield case), the story follows a family in London which is being tormented by a ghost. Essentially they seek out help in getting rid of the ghost; which brings back Ed and Lorraine from the first conjuring.<br/><br/>I cant credit this movie enough for its cinematography, consistently from scene to scene you are put straight in the movie with the rest of the characters. Top that with ingenious scene transitions and long shots which reveal things in the corner of your eye. Plus the jump scares don't feel cheap but earned from the way this movie creates suspense, which is rare these days as most jump scares are just thrown at the audience for no real reason.<br/><br/>Surprisingly I was also very invested in the characters, the family was very close and caring during such a tough time. Plus Ed and Lorraine had the cutest relationship IN A HORROR MOVIE. Which just makes you want to root for them throughout the movie.<br/><br/>This is a MUST see horror, it does everything right from story its characters to how its presented if only other horror movies to come learned from this masterpiece."

","First of all, this was a surprisingly strong sequel. As a fan of the first movie, I've been looking forward to this for quite some time. I watch a lot of horror movies and it always really bugs me how the setting is similar in all of them: family moves into house, house is haunted, paranormal researchers arrive and save the day. This film was no different and didn't stick out as very creative either but it was still pretty enjoyable. You can usually expect a solid horror movie when you watch something by James Wan. The film has a few good, however predictable scares. It's not subtle horror either, but the jumping-in-your-face kind. I don't really get why this has been rated 10/10 so many times as it is definitely not flawless. Another thing about this movie was its duration. Horror films are usually around 1h 30m, except this one was over 2 hours which I found a bit too long. For example, was that scene of Ed singing ""Can't help falling in love"" really necessary? In my opinion, you kind of start to lose interest after an hour because there is just that about 20 minutes long part where nothing really happens. To summarize this, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the sequel held up to the first one, however I think that it is still just an average horror movie."

This allowed for much better character development than the first one IMO. There were also some really well done scares and beautifully shot scenes in general. One of my favorite scenes involved a creepy painting (without giving too much away) that had me on edge the whole time. Acting was top notch - especially the girl who played Janet. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson have great chemistry as well. If you liked the first one I highly recommend checking this one out as you won't be disappointed.

Indie horrors would be my best choice until James Wan smartly came up with The Conjuring. For a sequel, I still couldn't believe how it blew my mind. The moment the movie started, I was already assaulted by various well played scares and darkly eerie scenes. The way Wan framed his shots were great. Not only giving the audience POVs but extreme close ups that brings us into their world as if we were there, watching it unfold. There were lots of build ups throughout the movie but... the ending was rather rushed. Would have loved to see a little longer and more climatic end. Kudos to the portrayal on Ed & Lorraine's romance which Patrick and Vera played wonderfully."

","There is no denying the fact this is a slick, well-polished horror film. The director is good. But that is what this is, a horror flick.<br/><br/>Going into this knowing the truth about Ed and Lorraine Warren and the actual Enfield case made it difficult for me to watch the movie at first. I honestly had to tell myself to just watch it for what it is, a horror movie.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is a spoiler or not, but I checked the box anyway just in case, but Ed and Lorraine Warren were exposed years and years ago and frauds. They faked the Amityville case, as well as many others.<br/><br/>Fact of the matter is, this movie is very LOOSELY based on a true story. It really bothers me when movies claim to be based on a true story when the movie itself is nothing like the actual truth.<br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine Warren barely had anything to do with this case. The Conjuring 2 makes it out like they were the knights in shining armor for the family when in reality they were laughed away from them.<br/><br/>The real Enfield case was heavily investigated by others, who on film disproved the claims and exposed the children as staging all of it. The real paranormal investigators on the case videotaped the children throwing things and setting up things and even the one child using a deep voice to sound like a ""demon."" The case was dismissed.<br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine Warren showed up and Ed, in his usual fashion said it was demonic even after the case was disproved as a hoax by the children.<br/><br/>With that being said, the Conjuring 2 is based on a hoax children orchestrated and passed off as truth involving two known frauds who in reality had very little to even do with it.<br/><br/>You can even do research on the first Conjuring and discover much of the same. The actual people that happened to called out the Warrens and eventually the film as fabricating information.<br/><br/>But again, as far as a horror movie goes it is great. Watch it for that. Do not believe for a second any of this actually happened. <br/><br/>The direction is phenomenal. The acting, sound, and imagery is superb. This is definitely one of the better horror movies I have seen since honestly the first Conjuring.<br/><br/>There is nothing new here. No new ground-breaking material. But the director takes an old formula and makes it work well.<br/><br/>I recommend it."

","Nothing in The Conjuring 2 can match the terrific hide-and-clap sequence from the earlier film – let's face it, that was always going to be hard to top – but that's not to say this sequel doesn't pack its share of solid scares. With 2013's The Conjuring, director James Wan, creator of both the Saw and Insidious franchises, managed to pump fresh blood into a genre as creaky as the haunted house thriller. This time he gives us a slow-building pressure-cooker of a film that's a respectable follow-up.<br/><br/>Set in 1977, not long after their success in the now famous Amityville case, the film sees hotshot paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) dispatched to London to look into the complaints of a family who claim they're being terrorized by a spirit.<br/><br/>Cash-strapped single mom Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four kids are dealing with a lot in their home – toys go on by themselves in the night, furniture starts flying across the room, and there are frequent rumblings and rattlings from behind the walls that can't be explained. But things really come to a boil when youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) begins to growl in an old man's voice, and their lives become seriously endangered.<br/><br/>The film's period setting and England's gloomy weather contribute a lot by way of atmospherics, and the Hodgson home in a working-class London suburb is all kinds of creepy with unsettling dark corners and rotting damp walls. Wan sets up the mood for some effective scares, giving us the kind of jump-in-your-seat moments we've come to expect from him now. Creepiest of all is a scene involving a framed painting on a wall, and the appearance of long white fingers from behind it.<br/><br/>But like the earlier film, what really separates this one from your standard issue horror movie is the level of performance that Wilson and Farmiga bring to the table. They're such good actors they sell the audience on even the cheesier aspects of the story, and of course on the romantic bond between the couple.<br/><br/>Although it feels way too long at roughly 133 minutes, and takes many liberties with the truth while still insisting it's based on true events, The Conjuring 2 ultimately succeeds in delivering slow-mounting dread punctuated by powerful moments of absolute terror. I don't know if I can see a nun dressed in a habit without a chill going down my spine."
"mm-39","7","0","1","24 June 2016"," Another haunting story.
","The Conjuring 2 is similar to The Conjuring. Another story about a haunting which the Warren's investigate basically a remix of the first installment. The different characters create a rapport which connects with the audience. James Wan (the director) creates a slow build up where the viewer always feels on edge for what is next to happen. Similar to other ghost stories! The usual over dramatic, over the top scares, which makes one wonder about fraud. I roll my eyes with skepticism with haunting stories. I still do not understand why they would store the cursed objects in their own house. I do not care that they lock the door, it is still too close for comfort. Creepy sets, and ghosts, but the ending is just too much to take. The Conjuring 2 is 7 out of ten stars."

","Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his clairvoyant wife, Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are back ghost-busting in this frightening sequel to ""The Conjuring."" Ed and Lorraine find helping out families with their ghostly problems is too much for them and both want to retire after the Amityville haunting. Lorraine rein-acts what happened in the house in her mind and it is frightening to her! She also sees this demonic nun (Bonnie Aarons) in her visions. <br/><br/>All the retirement plans change when a priest brings a tape recording to them to listen to. It is a man speaking in a British accent and Ed thinks the man is possibly senile. The priest tells him no. The owner of the voice is an 11-year-old girl named Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) who lives in the burg of Enfield, England in a 2 story house with her mom and siblings in 1977. Her father ran off with a neighbor lady who bore him twins. <br/><br/>The Hodgson family consists of Peggy (Frances O'Connor), older sister Margaret (Lauren Esposito), and two little brothers Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley). It has not been an easy time for the family after the man of the house left. Johnny is teased mercilessly by the kids at school because he stutters and Peggy worries how she will support herself and 4 kids. Into all of this Janet and Margaret are hearing noises late at night and the furniture starts to move on its own. Peggy doesn't know what to do about these disturbances and the police who visit her suggest she call the TV station and go on air telling the world what is happening to them. Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney) who challenges the Warrens at every turn, shows Margaret and Janet on his show. Janet starts talking in the deep voice and the lights flash on an off. <br/><br/>There are more hauntings with Janet being levitated off the ground and Johnny's zoetrope with the Crooked Man coming alive. The Crooked Man is played by Javier Botet and I think with his body structure and the fact he can move his arms and legs in strange ways due to Marfan Disease makes him a creepy addition to the movie! <br/><br/>It is revealed Janet is possessed by a man who died in her house and he reveals his name to be Bill Wilkins. Bill doesn't want to go to heaven or hell and the creepy nun is stopping his spirit from moving on. Another reveal that came as a surprise: Janet caused some of the furniture to move and it was caught on video by Anita Gregory (Franka Potente). Janet has no choice but to confess what she did and the Warrens leave. In the train, Lorraine has a vision of Bill Wilkins and he tells her he can't move on. He is held by a demon and the Warrens have to reveal the entity's name. <br/><br/>When they go back to the Hodgson house, the haunting is in full force with no help from Janet and Lorraine realizes she knows the demon's name because during a vision she wrote it in her Bible. She reveals the name just as demon is throwing Janet and Ed out of the window to their deaths. <br/><br/>This is great, creepy movie with wonderful performances from Patrick, Vera, and the rest of the cast! Madison Wolfe is also effective as the traumatized Janet who doesn't understand why the haunting is happening and she just wants to be a normal young girl who has a father and who isn't teased at school. This is a worthy sequel to ""The Conjuring""!"

","Classic is how i d call this movie. And that is not meant in a negative way. Story and progression is highly predictable if you a casual horror movie person - but it is the quality and pacing that makes this movie stand out.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, not just for a horror movie - but all in all. The chemistry between the protagonists is interesting and never really stereotypical (much). - Or lets say - it is of course clichéd but in a good way. (hard to explain, cause i d usually consider a clichéd character a bad thing) The characters do act as expected in a horror movie - but do not come across like morons (like so many horror movie character come across) - What i liked very much was that the characters actually communicate with each other. - A feature that is used in just so many horror movies (that is the non-communication-factor) to actually make the story possible in the first place.<br/><br/>Special effects and scares were well done.<br/><br/>All in all - the movie is not really too scary (nothing you loose your sleep about) - but it is enjoyable and suspenseful. Highly recommended."

","A pretty good horror movie! The story is fairly interesting and held me and my date's attention. The actors do a pretty good job at their roles, could be better, but they're never so bad that it ruins the movie.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there are moments when the scenery feels unrealistic. For example there's a scene where one character is being dragged into a window and it is obvious the character is a dummy. Other instances include props like trees and broken wood looking cheap and plasticy, but overall the environment is believable as long as you don't focus too much on it like I did.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in a drive in for $8, and I can say it was worth it. So if you find yourself able to see the movie for cheap, go for it. And bring a hot date!"

","I don't really like watching horror movie. To me that's a waste of time because most horror movies are just a series of scenes that scare you. <br/><br/>My first horror movie was ""Drag Me to Hell"". It was an okay movie, I quite like the plot, and the twist at the end. But it didn't change my mind about horror movies.<br/><br/>Then my second horror movie, which is ""Conjuring 2"", actually changed my mind! From the plot, to the twist, to the overall execution, it is just as good as drama movies! Yes, I am not kidding. If there is an Oscar for horror movie, ""Conjuring 2"" will surely top the list! It's that good. <br/><br/>And I can't imagine how a horror movie can get better, so a 10/10 here. (Let's hope James Wan proves me wrong with his prequel that has been rumored)<br/><br/>;)"
"Pramitheus","7","0","2","22 June 2016"," Wear a diaper in-case you are easily scared.
","A sincere thank you to James Wan for reviving the franchise after the debacle called ""Annabelle"". James Wan is probably the only director currently in Hollywood who is capable of making a believable horror film. The genre which is just full of either horror-comedy or horror gore was really becoming boring before Conjuring. It was becoming boring but then comes Conjuring 2. James Wan is a messiah of the horror genre.<br/><br/>Not going to talk about the plot but I am going to say this that a good horror movie doesn't need loud noises to build up a scene and James Wan knows that. Every build up scene in this movie just has the breathing of the characters or the noises on the wooden floors or a creepy chime music. That's all and BOOM!. The acting is very believable. Especially the little girl. Patrick and Vera are exceptional. The main crux of a horror movie is that you are not scared of the ghost or demon but you are scared for the characters and the imminent threat looming on them. If you don't care for the characters then a horror movie is a lost cause. You care about the Warrens and that keeps you hooked to every dark room, every whisper around them. I had a little problem with some jokes in the movie which I think could have been avoided but it's fine.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to watch a good horror movie and I would urge you to go alone if you want the full thrill of this movie."
"farhanparvez","8","0","3","22 June 2016"," Loved it!!
","I've been waiting for this movie since the first and i must say i really enjoyed it. It's a classic James Wan film, great direction, acting, and of course, its damn scary.<br/><br/>But The Conjuring 2 isn't as scary as the first film, but its almost there. The first film had a little more classic scares(can't forget that hide and clap scene). But its still terrifying and intense. The point is it is very difficult to make sequels of horror movies. But James Wan nails it. The performances too are solid. The character Janet is the star of the movie and Madison Wolfe portrays it beautifully. Incredible acting and you actually feel sympathy for her. Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson continue their epicness over here and more heart is given to their story.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is definitely worth watching. James Wan puts his horror tricks to a good use yet again."
"prachetosh","8","0","2","22 June 2016"," Delightfully frightening
","I rarely watch horror movies, but at the insistence of a friend, I agreed to go to this one. And believe me, at the end of the movie, I was really surprised and intrigued how this movie amazingly captured my breath. This movie sends your central nervous system to a spin with its innumerable terrorizing moments. The movie follows a common plot that most horror films do: a haunted house that is like 100 years old, demonical possession of a kid followed by oppression, havoc, destruction integrated with creaky staircases, darkness, flooded basements, and swirling furnitures. Just when you thought that you can anticipate the next sequence in the movie, you're proved terribly wrong. Because the direction team have done such a admirable job in the pacing of the plot that not in one moment the audience find themselves disengaged from the movie. They create the build-up, create inexhaustible anxiousness about it, then kill it and then give you a frightful shock when you are least expecting it. That is the real beauty of this movie: the nerve frizzling surprises. The story is set in England where a single disillusioned mother with 4 kids live in a house haunted by a previous owner who is now a ghost refusing to leave the house. The demon creates mayhem in the house diabolically torturing the family and creating ruckus at the most inopportune moments. The ghost takes on little daughter, Janet, 11, and uses her as his controller to channelize his wrath over the family. Real life ghost hunters are called upon to help the family and detect the root cause of this evil. But they are at their wit's end, and are unable to improve the family's situation. Finding themselves going under personal risk, they begin to ponder if it's all a hoax and nothing but a dramatical performance by the little girl, in order to seek attention from the society. The atmosphere gets creepier and creepier and just when you thought the number of shocks is just done, you are attacked with an another ghastly attack. You will literally hear your hearts beating out of your ears. However, given all the good points, the story is bit of a letdown. There will be no answers for your ""why is this happening"" or what is the reason. There is no explanation, the direction has relied on the no of jump-outs it gives to the audience. It is also not clear the motive of the ghost which is vaguely depicted. The director knows how to manipulate the pulse and breath of the audience and his successful tactics in making the audience jump has helped the disguise an otherwise pretty imprecise and hazy story. Overall, for a delightful frightening experience, you might try your money on this movie. Worth a watch. People who get frightened easily are asked not to watch it."
"felix-heppner","9","0","2","22 June 2016"," better than before
","I think The Conjuring 2 is better than the first movie. It is scarier,more intense and has more of those ""pls don't be there"" moments.Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and especially Lauren Esposito did a wonderful job, you can really feel the fear and tightness in Margret's psyche. Maybe one of the jump scares here and there could be omitted. And James Wan could have also leave off some horror cliché moments, but all in all The Conjuring 2 is very high above average with some moments and scares you can expect and some pictures and scenes you have seen before but probably not that that well done. Especially the evil and demonic side is very well done and manifested."
"thegeekculturepodcast","9","0","2","21 June 2016"," A Fiercer, Scarier, and Smarter 'Conjuring'
","Directed by: James Wan Most horror sequels have a tendency to be predictable and follow the same template as the first installment. You know where the evil is and when it will pop out and make you jump in your seat. Jason leaps at you with the machete, Freddy sneaks up on you in your dreams, and so on, tale as old as time. Being a fan of the first film, I expected this one to have the same tropes and construct with the characters and themes. I was wrong, dead wrong. This is one of the rare breed of horror sequel that is scarier than this original and raises the stakes for everyone including the audience.<br/><br/>Based on another one of Ed and Lorraine Warren's paranormal investigation cases (more specifically The Enfield Poltergeist), The film opens post-Amityville and we see our heroic duo famous but weary doing talk shows debating with skeptics about the incidents. Lorraine also worries that Ed might die in a future investigation after seeing a vision. They are then persuaded to visit a family in England who are being terrorized and discover something more sinister than they've ever faced before. When I say the stakes have been raised, that is just the tip of the iceberg. If the first installment was the first circle of hell, this one cranks it to the tenth, maybe even eleventh. Not since I rented the original ""Evil Dead"" when I was in high school have I been this scared. But the scares are just the beginning as the film also deals and balances weighty themes of faith, skepticism and facing our own fears. We care and fear for everyone as there is not one character that is disposable or purpose-less unlike in other horror franchises which have a habit of swapping out leads and side-characters like batteries in a remote. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga give fantastic and award-worthy performances as Ed and Lorraine Warren.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is scarier than the original and also more thought-provoking that leaves you not only breathless but also raises some interesting questions and discussions in the process. If you weren't frightened by true evil before, this one might just change your mind."

","The Conjuring 2 manages to up everything that was in the first one. Doing what most horror sequels tend to do by upping there production budget and effects even more. Sadly this is also what hurts the Conjuring 2 as it feels very bloated and very lengthy. A good horror movie should be 90 to 105 minutes in length no longer. This film instead is 134 minutes long making for a long over done film with waaay to much going on. <br/><br/>The film just doesn't feel very concise has a good story . And the movie suffers from not enough being cut out and making it keep going on and on. <br/><br/>The characters are still great as I love the relationship between the warrens and the love story that is also being told within this film as well. <br/><br/>The cinematography is also amazing along with the sound design. Everything in this film has a purpose and adds to the film's beauty and all the fear that is being built up with it. <br/><br/>This is a film I recommend to any horror fan as I think there is a lot to like here if your in that field"

","The first half of this story is really the true story, the second half when the warrens come to London is the fantasy part of the story. Its OK but feels like two different films put together both don't get a great ending, the warrens have so many cases they could have picked but they choose to add them to a true story they were never part off. The warrens should have been left out the film the conjuring series does not have to be about them, and it also takes the light away from the real ghost investigators from the case giving them bit parts in the movie. On the other hand this filming catches 70s London great and the atmosphere is of a high level 7/10 just don't believe its a true story."
"bartonj2410","8","0","2","18 June 2016"," A horror sequel that actually delivers the horror
","There's a reason we get so many horror films released every year; they are relatively cheap to make and guaranteed to make the studio money. No matter how bad the horror could end up being, people love the thrill and rush the experience of watching a horror film at the cinema gives you.<br/><br/>Sequels have become one of the most sinister things in film today, some seeing them as nothing but quick ways of making more money however, if done well, sequels can be one of the more interesting things in film. In the case of The Conjuring 2, it's definitely the latter.<br/><br/>Six years after the events in Rhode Island, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren are called to Enfield, England, to investigate the paranormal events that the Hodgson family have been experiencing in their home, in particular Janet (Madison Wolfe).<br/><br/>Having investigated the Amityville murders of 1974, Lorraine has since had visions that feature a powerful entity, forcing her to believe that the choice to carry on their line of work could lead to tragedy.<br/><br/>What I really have to commend The Conjuring 2 for is the fact that it doesn't just feel like a carbon copy of its predecessor. Don't get me wrong, the two films certainly have similarities but this didn't feel like watching the first film over again.<br/><br/>The film does this by telling two stories; one of the Hodgson family in Enfield and another about the visions that Lorraine has been haunted by after their investigation of the Amityville murders. These two stories connect much better than the stories of the family being haunted and the Annabelle doll in the first film.<br/><br/>I have to praise James Wan for the job he does directing The Conjuring 2, expertly building suspense through the use of sound, camera movements and editing. John R. Leonetti returns as cinematographer and there really are some fabulous shots in this film, some leading to false predictions of when and where something would jump out on the screen. The film uses jump scares but it doesn't solely rely on them to scare the audience, one particular scene with Lorraine coming face to face with the demon haunting her slowly building to almost nerve-shredding levels of suspense.<br/><br/>The performances in The Conjuring 2 are also worth mentioning, with both Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga returning to good effect, Farmiga once again being the film's biggest asset. I was really impressed with Madison Wolfe as Janet, the member of the Hodgson family targeted by the demon and also Frances O'Connor who played her mother.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 will no doubt have audiences worldwide jumping out of their seats and give Warner Bros. a tidy profit when it finishes its run at the box-office. James Wan is the man they should be thanking and I'd like to thank him also for producing another horror that looks for more than one way to scare its audience."

Is story-line of 'The Conjuring 2' gripping enough?, we'll it's based on a true story & one of the well noted Cases the Warren couples encountered in their lifetime & thanks to director James Wan I got to see this fantastically Horrific Story on screen & as usual loved Ed & Lorraine Warren played by Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson. I consider it as The all time best movie to be ever made in this Genre (2nd one is obviously 'The Conjuring'). <br/><br/>--contains crucial plot ahead, return if you don't want to hear the story & just watch the movie instead.<br/><br/>The story itself takes place at the tail end of the 1970s, The film begins with paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren documenting the Amityville murders at the Amityville house in 1976, to determine if a demonic presence was truly responsible for Ronald DeFeo Jr. mass murdering his family on November 13, 1974. During a seance, Lorraine is drawn into a vision where she relives the murders and discovers a demonic nun figure, before seeing Ed being fatally impaled. After a struggle, Ed is able to break her out of the vision.<br/><br/>In 1977, the Hodgson family begins to discover strange occurrences within their home in London, England. Janet, the second oldest of four children, is seen sleepwalking and conversing in her dreams with an entity who insists that the house is his. Eventually, all siblings of the house and their mother Peggy witness paranormal events occurring right before their eyes, forcing them to seek refuge with their neighbors. When the media attempts to interview the Hodgsons, Janet is possessed by the spirit of Bill Wilkins, an older man who previously lived and died in the house, and who wants to claim his territory. As Janet begins to show more signs of demonic possession, the story eventually reaches the Warrens, who are requested to assist the local Church in the investigation. Lorraine, in fear of her vision of Ed's death becoming reality, warns him not to get too involved in the case, and reluctantly agrees to travel to London.<br/><br/>& rest is History (literally) & not at all supposed to happen in the normal/conventional paranormal investigation movies, too many twist & turns, unpredictability, Jump scares, demon, haunting, etc. it really scared me which doesn't happen anymore these days. It's ground breaking altogether. I'm looking forward for the sequel (The Conjuring 3) of the successful horror franchise..."

"AudioFileZ","8","0","2","17 June 2016"," Perfect Tension With Plenty of Action...A New Genre Classic
","There has been no movie to stand with The Exorcist for over 35 years in that movies unique horror set. There is now, finally, one that can. The Conjuring 2 picks up the the same unique dark fear and runs with it. It does run too because almost immediately the viewer is plunged into a revisiting, by Loraine Warren, of the how the events played out in the Amityville N.Y. case. It's a good segue-way not just in tone, but as a personal vision Loraine senses regarding Ed. It pushes her, along with the guffaws of the press, to push Ed into agreeing they'd not take on any new cases. Of course this doesn't last when the Catholic Church asks them to vet a particularly high-profile situation a family is London is experiencing.<br/><br/>Now, here's whee I have no touchstone personally if this is played out like the actual case or not. It is probably better this way. Already the viewer is invested in The Warrens as doing what they do very genuinely. Putting them in a case they did actually attempt to vet just seems like the two best people doing what they have a rare talent for. And what a case it is. Without any head spinning we get many of the same chills, maybe played out with a bit less shock, but none the less just as malevolent. It's this keeping it more in your face and simple that seems to be right here. There is a constant fear and oppression which unfolds in an escalating way. When the viewer feels the most fear the whole thing falls apart as it appears to be a hoax. Even the Warrens are shut down. That's when the clincher of a fine ending begins. For the horror genre this is pure gold.<br/><br/>While I'm sure those whose dissect these things have made a long list of faux pas the average viewer won't bat an eye regarding. So much has been steadily crafted the brought to a climax by the great ending one feels a sense of relief in which a harrowing journey seems to be, finally, over. I give the entire movie many pluses. From the period spot-on latter 70;s London with gloom and doom portrayed in the excellent cinematography combined with the played straight screenplay and excellent acting this is a horror film that truly works. Like I said earlier, I feel it stands with the gold standard that for so long had few peers."
"actionmoviestar","Null","0","1","16 June 2016"," Surprisingly good horror sequel to a mediocre film
","I always say that I am going to write a short review but I end up rambling on anyway. I really do not care if a horror movie is scary or not. I know that does not make a whole lot sense, since we know that horror movies main objective is to scare you. As long as it is entertaining and interesting, that is all that matters to me. With that being said, ""The Conjuring 2"" is one of the better mainstream horror sequels in recent years and it really did keep me engaged. <br/><br/>James Wan's direction is very good. He successfully makes this a supernatural moody horror flick. Even though there are cheap jump scares that you can see from a mile away, the malevolent forces were way more interesting and threatening, than in the first film. <br/><br/>The screenplay by Chad & Carey Hayes, James Wan and David Johnson wisely puts more focus on the family this time, instead of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's characters. They play more of a supporting role and it works, following a different path than most horror flicks these days. <br/><br/>The cast does an adequate job with what they are given. The supporting cast includes Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor, Lauren Esposito, Benjamin Haigh and Patrick McAuley. <br/><br/>I remember not being too impressed by the first ""Conjuring"" film. Matter of fact, it was my last date movie. As for this one, this makes a pretty good date flick. <br/><br/>The cinematography by Don Burgess is the best thing about this movie. It is probably the best cinematography that I have seen in mainstream horror film since 2014's ""The Purge: Anarchy."" This is a well shot film and he totally plays up the ""boogeyman lurking around the corner"" fear. <br/><br/>Go see ""The Conjuring 2."" It is probably going to be one of the best mainstream horror movies I will see this year. I kind of hate I liked this movie so much because that means I might not like part 3. Part 3 is coming. Box office receipts will prove that."
"lois-lane33","4","0","2","16 June 2016"," This film could have been done much better than this.
","Patrick Wilson & Vera Framiga were fine in terms of their acting in this movie. The home of the family who were the subject of this movie was depicted as a pigsty, complete with dirty telephones and disintegrating walls & badly worn furniture. Such a depiction greatly reduced the scripts effectiveness as tale about 'ordinary people in trouble.' People generally didn't live in unclean homes like this in the late 1970's unless they were in the drug trade. This historical issue ruins this movie and it becomes a sort of parody-a parody of a horror movie and a parody of the late 1970's, which is probably not what it was intended to be. All in all it was a bleak movie but it was bleak due to its depiction of an era that had a lot of things going on in it. Little of which was present in the movie. I don't recommend seeing it."
"RforFilm","9","0","2","15 June 2016"," The crooked man and demons make The Conjuring 2 a rare horror sequel that's better then the original
","The case of whether ghosts exist or not has been a fittingly eternal debate. Some say that it's simply a trick on the mind whenever we feel a cool chill. Others say that the presence of these spirits is the key to finding proof on the afterlife. Because of this debate, ghosts and the search for them have never been more popular. Their a constant subject of stories and movies. They even have their own reality show on the Travel Channel titled Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters on Syfy. Some cases, like the one portrayed in the movie, are examples of haunted houses that are covered by real news agencies, yet are still questioned by scientists for their academic basis.<br/><br/>What were also looking at is a sequel for 2013 hit The Conjuring. Like many people, I was surprised by how much I liked it, having phrased it for a likable pair of ghost hunters, diving into the personalities of those being haunted, and some genuine good scares. Sequels to horror movies are tough as they tend to repeat stories, loosing much of the unpredictability the original story had. With James Wan returning to his franchise, let's see if The Conjuring 2 can bring us some new scares. <br/><br/>We first open with our same husband wife ghost hunting team Ed (played by Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (played by Vera Farmiga) who are examining the Amityville murders (yes, the same one from The Amityville Horror). Loraine attempts to contact the spirits during a seance, but a vision of a demonic nun and of Ed getting killed scares her into convincing she and her husband to retire. We then head across the pond to London where a single mom is raising her four children. Like any horror movie, small things start to happen such as the television set reacting oddly and chairs moving by themselves. Even when they leave an stay at a friends house, the poltergeist follows them there. <br/><br/>Various news outlets take in the constant photos and even interview the youngest daughter Janet whose often possessed by that poltergeist. The spirit reveals himself as an old man who had died in the house before the family moved in. The local church hires Lorraine and Ed to investigate. They originally decline, not sure if the events are true or just a hoax. But when they uncover more facts about the house and other demons, this just may prove to be their most dangerous case. <br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 is a rare example of not being just as good as the original, but it might even be better. Like before, the story places most of the focus on getting to know the family that's being haunted and of the new tension between our ghost hunters. You feel bad that the family is going through these spooky events, and yet you understand why most academics would consider the hauntings a total fake. There's even a clever moment that makes you question everything that young daughter Janet was doing. Of course I won't spoil that here.<br/><br/>Director James Wan is a horror maker who understands how important it is to not just scare people, but to help earn those scares. Anyone can pick up a camera and flicker a few lights to make a scary movie, but he's too smart to fall into that easy trope. He can lead his stories into a spooky symphony that plays so elegantly that you wish he's take charge of all horror movies. The only issue that can be bothersome is that the film's formula is very similar to the first movie. I defend this by saying that James Wan was able to improve on some of the story elements, but some of the suspense is taken away when you realize where things are going. <br/><br/>I'll give this nine zoetropes out of ten. The Conjuring 2 is an entertaining sequel that took the best elements from the original and took it another step in storytelling and scares. Fans of the original will defiantly like this movie and maybe even some that didn't watch the first. The good news is that you don't need to see it to enjoy this movie. If your looking for hot summer bump in the night, then The Conjuring 2 is a pretty good choice."

"gorymindedkid","Null","0","2","14 June 2016"," I was expecting something that actually never happened the entire film....
","Sure, we can't get inside the theater without not knowing that we're gonna get stapled to our seat watching same old brainless protagonist going to provoke some ominous spirit with occasional jump scare, same old classic horror story plot yadda yadda yadda. Unfortunately, when a horror movie became so predicted, it became boring. How can you get scared if whenever they show this kind of scene: the protagonist takes something from the mirror- cabinet at the bathroom then closes it, BAM! you're gonna see some stuff on the reflection, right?<br/><br/>But James Wan, he actually SUCCEEDED in breaking some of those stereotypes of horror movies' tricks in The Conjuring (2013)  instead of showing just mere flashing figures of Bathsheeba the camera just literally closing in on that thing crawling above the kids' wardrobe during that one scene in the bedroom, with equally decent sound mixing& editing as a supporting element, It instantly became the sole reason why I fell in love with his works.<br/><br/>This sequel though, doesn't feel like it's his. I don't feel his touch a.k.a some element of surprises in this film, like at all. It was just all too..predictable. I mean there was this one scene during Annabelle (2014) , which shows a harmless ghost of a girl running towards the main character with the door closing up, then proceeds to slam that door open but not as a small girl anymore but instead an evil entity with a true intention to kill THAT IS an element of surprise I was looking for in this sequel. The use of a close up of certain housewares stuff , which could potentially become harmful for people and felt some sort of life- threatening like this sewing machine in Annabelle (2014), didn't make any appearances at all as well. This is unfortunate because it may be able to add up something to help to create that eerie ambiance they were trying so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>I heard that he turned to direct Fast series in hope of finding fresh new ideas for his horror movies but JAMES... this feels like an apple being left out to rot under a hot sun....isn't FRESH at all<br/><br/>I lost it during the crooked man's first appearance, which felt so damn cheesy and give out this Babadook (2014) kind of vibe (which is not a good sign for me), and fine, I get it, turned out it was totally practical (not CG) with a real actor posing as the crooked man then why the hell it felt so out of place?<br/><br/>Valak, being the main attraction in this movie clearly is good at nothing but growl (and Jesus, in need of a dentist appointment with those bleeding gums). They could've dug deeper about his origin, M O T I V E S, (she clearly wanted to kill Janet but is that all?), and probably some P O T E N T I A L (to scare the audienceshaha)<br/><br/>Too many questions left unanswered in my head the moment I stepped out of the cinema, including : ""Has James Wan ran out of brilliant horror movies' ideas already or was he just trying to be.experimental? hmmm"""
"dvc5159","6","0","1","9 June 2016"," A better and scarier film than the first
","The 1977 British haunting known as the Enfield Poltergeist has sparked controversy and has been accused of being complete hogwash. The famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) have now got their work cut out for them with this one. But director/co-writer James Wan is not concerned about busting myths. The guy wants us to be scared silly and have a ball. He has succeeded. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. <br/><br/>That's the modus operandi of Wan's latest scare-a-thon, the sequel to the 2013 summer blockbuster. This is better than the first – bigger, scarier and much more intense. The first film was fun, but it relied too heavily on nostalgic and retro traits, having aped/paid homage to 1979's ""The Amityville Horror"". This new one is no different – it acts as a ""greatest hits"" album of classic horror movie moments – specifically, those of ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Exorcist"". <br/><br/>Wan's passion for the genre shines through in every scene. His unnerving atmosphere soaks the film in a shroud of doom and gloom, relentlessly unleashing his old- school house of horrors until the curtain call. It creaks, it moans, it shrieks when need be, never short-changing the character development and audience in the process.<br/><br/>This is not the horror film of the year so far (that honour belongs to the haunting indie film ""The Witch""), but as far as popcorn horror films go, this one's really good - and a good stepping stone to introduce newcomers to ""Exorcist""-style classics, a trait which I suspect was Wan's true intention all along, having already establishing himself as today's go-to filmmaker for spooky films."
"stinadianne","8","0","2","9 June 2016"," Chilling and thrilling! A worthy sequel!
","James Wan seems to be the only consistent horror director working today, cranking out hit after hit, with his explosive start helming the first Saw film. His follow up to The Conjuring, The Conjuring 2 is a worthy sequel, and while the first installment of the haunted adventures of the Warrens' shines brighter than this follow up, The Conjuring 2 still thrills and chills with the help of well placed jump scares, a tone of absolute dread, and beautiful camera work.<br/><br/>It's been seven years since Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and her husband, Ed (Patrick Wilson), helped The Perron family with their haunted Rhode Island house. When Lorraine has a premonition of a terrifying demonic force threatening to kill Ed, she decides they cannot investigate anymore to keep him safe. Across the pond in Enfield, England, the Hodgson family is being terrorized by the angry spirit of an old man named Bill (Bob Adrian). The eleven-year-old Janet (Madison Wolfe) seems to be the focus of all the hubbub and the primary victim of Bill's rage. When the police come by one night, after a particularly scary attack, and witness supernatural activity themselves, the Hodgon's soon find themselves in the middle of a media firestorm about their haunted home. The church sends Ed and Lorraine to England to confirm the authenticity of the case despite Lorraine's hesitance and worries about Ed's safety.<br/><br/>Wilson and Farmiga are still as charming as ever playing the real-life Warrens, who spent decades investigating the supernatural. They are a perfect pair of love, faith, and empathy. Their capacity for goodwill is rooted in their unwavering Christian faith- something that is not popular or looked upon as a legitimate motivation for character actions these days. The pair are written so likable that their faith cannot simply be laughed away. They use it as their foundation in all that they do, in their unwavering sense of charity in helping this family in need, and also as a fierce weapon against evil. Even the most hardened atheist will find it difficult to deny how bad ass Lorraine is as she holds up her Bible or the potent power of Ed's crucifix around his neck when they wield them in defense against the nasty spirit tormenting the Hodgsons. Madison Wolfe, who plays Janet, the poor girl being hit with the most abuse, is a wonderful actress. You feel her exhaustion and her utter loss of hope as the movie continues on. Wolfe exhibits the talent of someone much older than herself. You empathize with her highs and her lows- something usually difficult for such a young actor to achieve.<br/><br/>The camera work is almost another character in The Conjuring 2. Simple zooms, upside down shots, and pans induce the fear in the audience, who witness some horrors that the characters do not. In one sequence the youngest Hodgson boy, Billy (Benjamin Haigh), has a blanket tent set up at the end of a dark hallway. When one of his toys rolls by itself out from the darkness, he jumps into bed in fear while the camera focuses on the tent, giving the audience a good forty-five seconds of fear of what is inside the dark tent and waiting for whatever it may be to jump out. With this tactic, Wan includes the audience in the narrative, giving each person their own personal journey with this haunting.<br/><br/>While it is indeed a well made and effective film in it's own right, The Conjuring 2 is more scattered plot-wise than the tightly scripted The Conjuring. It spreads itself a little too thin as it tries to include slight subplots of some of the real life people who were present during the Enfield Hauntings, including Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney), who was an investigator and the most constant and dedicated supporter for the Hodgson's during their plight. He is an important figure in the actual real-life story, but this movie is about the Warrens and the Hodgens, and any departure from them feels like an overkill of information.<br/><br/>James Wan is not only a great director of horror but also in general. Hopefully he is just getting started with The Conjuring series. Based on the quality thus far of the first two films, you can potentially expect to be treated and frightened by a whole franchise based on the hundreds of the Warrens real-life haunted adventures."
"disney1113","9","0","2","11 June 2016"," The Conjuring 2: More Than Just A Horror Movie
","The Conjuring 2<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>By Stephanie Cieplinski<br/><br/>Every now again we come across films that are considered horror movies, yet are so much more than that. Silence of the Lambs (1991), The Exorcist (1973), and Psycho (1960) all come to mind. All of these films are horrific in nature, but have messages that blur the lines between genres. James Wan has done it again with this thrilling and chilling sequel to his 2013 film The Conjuring. Returning are Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, and written for the screen by Wan (Insidious, Saw), Carey Hayes and Chad Hayes (The Conjuring, House of Wax) and David Johnson (Orphan). <br/><br/>This film isn't merely blood, gore and jump scares; it's a heart-wrenching love story, loosely based on the real-life marriage between the Warrens. This is the most connected we've ever been to characters in Wan's films that doesn't rely on horror, but on a lesson about life and morality. We're invested more than before with the Warren family and even more so with the single mother-run household of Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four children Janet (Madison Wolfe), Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley). The same disturbing images and visions that are haunting Lorraine and Ed, are connected to the haunting happening at the Hodgson residence. We're dealt with more scares and eerie spirits putting the characters we care so much about in immediate danger. After all, Lorraine can predict the future--she has a premonition of Ed's death. <br/><br/>The film picks up during the Warrens' visit to Amityville, Long Island, where they manage to help the Defeo family even amongst rumors that the ""haunting"" was a hoax to garner media attention. We follow Ed and Lorraine as well as Peggy, Janet and their family in Enfield, England. Once Peggy Hodgson sees that the Warrens were able to help the Defeo's, Peggy solicits the church and by extension, the Warrens. Not only have the children and Peggy seen unusual happenings in their home, but so have their neighbors and the local police. They are desperate to drive away the spirit of a man named Bill Wilkins, who used to live and then subsequently died, in their home years prior. <br/><br/>C2 stirs up not only of what we fear, but how it can be utilized against us. The camera movement is one step ahead of you and these consistent movements draw tension from the audience all the while building up a scare that may or may not come. Sometimes we believe that there will be a pay off. We are anxious and ready for something scary and then, it never comes, which only makes us more on edge for the next scene. <br/><br/>Wan also makes nods to his previous films. He successfully develops a unique world where we are familiar with the rules. What many of his previous films and C2 consistently question is: Is what we see really just a trick of the light? Are we imagining some things or is it something evil lurking, preparing to prey on us during our most vulnerable moments? It's also important to note that Wilson has quite a fantastic singing voice! I had ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" by Elvis Presley stuck in my head the entire rest of the night. There are fantastic supporting roles as well played by Simon McBurney as Maurice Grosse, an expert on paranormal activity and Franka Potente, who we haven't seen on the big screen in a long time as Anita Gregory, who only wants to catch the supposed hoax of the Hodgson family. <br/><br/>This is a film that can make you tear up for the moral (stand up for the ones that you love, stick together and you can conquer anything--you are not alone) and bawl like a baby at the horrific imagery. Even the storyline in and of itself makes us doubt what we've been seeing the entire time. This is a film that will continue to scare you long after you've walked out of the theater."

"DavidRod87","8","0","2","12 June 2016"," A worthy sequel with some flaws.
","If you liked the first movie you will not be disappointed. The Conjuring 2 keeps most of the strengths of the first movie to create a tense atmosphere while telling a story with enough depth to keep you interested until the end. The camera work is worth mentioning since it is remarkably effective at creating fear and tension through forced perspective and blurry images.<br/><br/>However, in this sequel the characters are not as well-defined as in the previous one. Most of the characters in the family have little personality and are defined by a single trait: the little brother stutters, the mom has money problems, the other brother does nothing. This might seem like minor detail in a horror movie but it hinders the creation of a connection with the characters and, therefore, worrying about what happens to them.<br/><br/>The movie could have had more engaging characters but this won't prevent anyone from enjoying the film. It is a very good horror movie and a worthy sequel. I highly recommend it. Go see it!"

"JasonsLists","8","0","2","12 June 2016"," Can A Movie Be Too Scary?
","The acting and other technical elements of The Conjuring 2 make it a well made film but most movie-goers just want to know if it really is that scary. I say it most definitely is. There is no edge of your seat excitement and there is nothing fun about it, it's just really scary. Some scenes were similar to the first movie but most of the time I forgot I was watching a sequel. All the characters seemed equally important and Vera Farmiga is very pretty but all of that gets overlooked due to how scary it is. It was a bit uncomfortable to watch and I wanted it to be over but I mean that as a compliment.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite horror movies are An American Werewolf In London, Phantasm, the original Halloween, the original Fright Night, and some films in the A Nightmare On Elm Street series. Those are classic scary movies that play each year on certain networks during the month of October and fall into that category of a worst case scenario. Imagine how scary it would be if your nightmares could get you in real life or if a vampire moved into the house next door to you. Those are movies you can watch at home with the lights out while snacking on popcorn and chugging a soda and having fun while being scared. The Conjuring 2 however is a seriously terrifying two hour commitment that I do not want to watch at home alone. What if that hideous demon in the movie comes to get me? There's no fun in that!<br/><br/>I remember seeing commercials for Paranormal Activity that showed the audience scared and looking away from the screen for a moment before peeking back and enjoying the experience like a sort of amusement ride. I like the films in that series. The Conjuring 2 had a different effect on the audience. The theater was silent throughout the entire film and after it ended people left the theater quickly and in silence. I got the feeling they were scared out of their wits.<br/><br/>Rather than repeating myself by saying it was really scary, I'll sum it up. This is not a horror movie you mix in with teen-screams, slashers, or monster movies. It goes with The Exorcist or The Shining, especially when they were first released. One that will have even the most seasoned horror fan checking their closets and under their beds before going to sleep. See it in the theater if you can and good luck!"

","James Wan returned to direct this superb sequel that sees Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga resuming their roles of real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are first seen(in a most effective prologue) investigating the notorious Amityville haunting in 1976, before moving forward a year to being asked by the Church to look into the veracity of the reports of a haunting in Enfield, England, where the Hodgson family(a single mother and her four children) are being terrorized by a seemingly evil old man who had died in the house, but as the Warrens discover, the situation is far more complicated and sinister than that...A match for the original, this intelligent, chilling, frightening sequel is even better, with a well crafted plot that pays off emotionally and spiritually by the heart-stopping climax. A model of its kind, and further installments done like this would be most welcome, as there are still more cases to tell..."
"misterembryo","9","0","2","12 June 2016"," Conjuring 2 Director James Wan is the Master Magician of Horror
","Director James Wan is a magician. He has all the tricks... Sleight of hand... Misdirection... Creating illusions that will terrify you to the core, without having to resort to gore or cheap thrills. Granted he is a master of making you jump out your seat, of making your heart skip a beat, but it's his ability to force you to hold your breath that makes his Conjuring movies so appealing and so much fun to watch. The camera pans and tilts at weird angles. The foreground and background focus and blur interchangeably as if to visually bend reality. A voice whispers in the dark. And through all this, somewhere in the back of your mind, the nagging horror that horrified you when you watched the Exorcist for the very first time, five words: <br/><br/>Based on a true story.<br/><br/>Like the first Conjuring (brilliant movie) the sequel is a dramatization of a case investigated by real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The first Conjuring described the events of a house haunted by a witch called Bathsheba. The Warrens were often tackling multiple cases at once, and to emphasize the emotional stress that came with it, the first Conjuring also detailed the Warrens' experiences with a doll named Anabelle that reportedly came to life, possessed by an evil spirit, that is to this day locked away in a glass case in the back of the Warren household.<br/><br/>In Part 2 we are re-introduced to the Warrens by reminding us of the case that catapulted the couple into the public eye, the murders in Amityville. The majority of this film, however, actually takes place across the pond in London, where a strange entity disturbed the peace of a poor, struggling single-mom and her four children. This became the most documented paranormal case in history, an entity known as the Enfield Poltergeist.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2 has a great cast. Frances 'O Connor plays Peggy Hodgson, the single mom who has to hold the house together in the midst of all the horror, including all the ridicule from non-believers. She's a mother trying and failing to maintain sanity. She wants to be brave for her kids, yet can't help but to be visibly agitated. Her youngest son Billy, a little boy with a stutter, is adorable, constantly bullied by his peers but is overwhelmed with boundless joy at the sight of a biscuit! The one who stole the show, however, was Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, who in the real-life haunting was the entity's favorite target. Definitely see shades of Linda Blair in her performance.<br/><br/>Other players like Simon McBurney as Maurice Gross, the British paranormal investigator who was primarily involved with the Enfield Poltergeist, even the constables who corroborated that some freaky stuff went down in the house, look and act just like those involved in the real case (did some investigating of my own on YouTube). <br/><br/>Of course the real heroes of the film are Ed and Lorraine Warren played by Patrick Wilson (Insidious) and Vera Fermiga (Bates Motel) - as you can see both actors have a tendency towards dark material. They are an attractive couple, extremely likable, and as in the first Conjuring, there's a sense of adoration and compassion for the work the Warrens do. Both Patrick and Vera have this uncanny ability to make you feel comforted one minute, but with a slight contortion of the face, you know something is wrong. ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" Regardless whether you believe in this stuff or not, there's admiration for a couple who have dedicated their lives to helping others, freeing the tormented from inexplicable horrors when no one else can. Ed and Lorraine Warrens were the only ones outside of the clergy who were authorized by the Catholic Church to perform exorcisms.<br/><br/>""Based on a true story"" should always be taken with a grain of salt. There are definitely some fantastical terrors that are there for show, inspired by nightmares as seen in Insidious or the Babadook. Like the first Conjuring, they don't turn a blind eye to alternative explanations for the events that take place, and allow you to view the subject from the skeptic's standpoint before diving headfirst into the dark realm of the beyond. One thing for sure is that the filmmakers have respect for the original material, pulling from old photographs to recreate the real settings, down to the details of the posters on their bedroom walls. What better example is there of respect for the material than this: prior to filming Conjuring Part 2, the filmmakers had a Catholic priest come in to bless the set. Apparently eerie occurrences took place when they filmed the first Conjuring movie. <br/><br/>I ain't afraid of no ghosts. No poltergeist is going to stop Director James Wan and Writers Chad and Carey Hayes from telling the amazing story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and with many more cases yet to be explored, I really hope they can conjure up another one."

","The horror genre, a movie category that tries to be good, but often ends up a joke during most movies. Occasionally though, we get a film that provides a good thrilling scare and is actually worth the admission price. For me, The Conjuring was one of those movies able to provide the chills I was looking for with a story to match. When I heard a sequel was coming, I feared that its good name would be diluted by the Hollywood haste to make money (remember Annabelle?). Hi Robbie K here, and today I review the Conjuring 2 and share my thoughts on the latest film. Let's get started. <br/><br/>THE GOOD  Story  Integrated scares  Acting/Recurring Cast<br/><br/>Seldom do we get a horror movie with an actual story, instead focusing on how to make people jump. This is not the case with this film my friends. Director James Wan and his team have managed to craft a tale that is both entertaining and interesting to watch. Conjuring 2's story takes place a few years after the first with the Warren's continuing their investigations of the paranormal. Meanwhile, across the ocean, the Hodgson family begins to experience their own paranormal activity that will eventually warrant inspection by our detectives. Sounds simple I know, and in truth it is, but Wan's delivery is fantastic. <br/><br/>He manages to build suspense in his tale, using a gradual series of scares to build the tension and slowly reveal the truth in the haunting. And to throw in the few twists they did, only added more depth to the story. But Wan goes one step further and decides to bring some character development into mix, helping to add depth to all involved to help us connect with the film. The Warren's story was great to expand on, discussing the origins of our detectives, while also dropping in a little bit of love to sweeten the deal. And if that weren't enough, he even manages to keep all of the scares pertinent to the story, integrating them into the plot rather than dropping a random scare moment that Hollywood is famous for. By having the scares have a purpose, they removed the corny aspects and added an edge that made the only that much better. Of course, having a great cast to act out this story is the final piece of the puzzle. The repeat performance by Wilson and Farmiga was just as strong, the chemistry between them solid that I believed they were a couple. Newcomers to the series Madison Wolfe and Frances O'Connor played their roles as a terrified family to the letter, while also having another side to them that made you feel sorry for them. Finally Simon McBurney as Maurice Gross added some finesse to the cast, with a little comedic relief when the going got tough. But while fantastic alone, the chemistry between everyone was on point and only made things that much better.<br/><br/>THE BAD:  Still another horror movie  Dropped some plot points/unexplained  Predictable scare tactics<br/><br/>It was difficult to find weaknesses in this movie for me, but there are a few things that took away from the movie for me. First is that this is still another horror movie that fits in well with other films of the same genre. We've had some unique horror films in the past, but this one is just a good old fashioned haunted house story. Again this is a picky weakness, but the originality could have used a bit more tweaking in my opinion. <br/><br/>A bigger weakness is some of the plot points and presentation in the film. Wait a minute, I just said the plot was good didn't I? Yes it is, but it's not perfect and the Conjuring 2 has a few moments that I was still wanting closure on. I have to be sparing to not spoil anything, but one major detail lacking is why one particular thing has a vendetta against the family. A second limiting plot point is how two of the characters sort of drop out of the story without so much as a blink when they had played a key role in the film. But even with these limitations, the story itself was mostly complete and had a good closure, again I'm grasping at straws here. In addition there were some melodramatic moments that were a bit drawn out and somewhat cheesy to me. Oh well can't be perfect right.<br/><br/>Finally the scare tactics are still predictable as ever and didn't really get me with the exception of one time. Camera angles giving away something, music eerily going silent and the occasional getting out of bed to walk in a dark hallway give away the horror from a mile away. But while I'm used to it, other members of the audience were still howling in fear, so again this may be a moot point. <br/><br/>THE VERDICT:<br/><br/>Overall, The Conjuring 2 is a sequel quite worthy of being called just as good as the original. Wan and his group has shown that a horror movie can have a story and still be scary despite the beliefs of Hollywood. The engaging characters, the well timed suspense, and the integrated scares are surely the best selling points. With few weakness to point out, this reviewer can't help but recommend this one for a theater visit for you horror fans out there. <br/><br/>My scores for this movie are:<br/><br/>Horror: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5"

"shivamt25","8","0","2","12 June 2016"," As entertaining as first one!
","It has a very strong story, stronger than the first one. I found it very fascinating that it was very easy to feel connected to the characters, to feel bad for them. It was a strong point for the first one also. <br/><br/>The thing about conjuring is, and I am talking about both of them, is that it may not be scary enough for you, but it has all the element that a good girl movie should have, which is lacking now a days.<br/><br/>They had to show what was happening with the affected family as well as they had to show the connection between Ed and Lorraine. They succeeded in doing that effectively. <br/><br/>There was no problem in the acting department. Even the kids did there part very well. I've always been a fan of James Wan. He did miracles here too. There was this feel of constant tension on screen which holds well with the story. <br/><br/>So, my verdict is that you should check it out, like seriously make sure you watch this one. Can't decide which of the two films I liked better."

","I have not seen the part 1 yet, but the part 2 is very good! I recommend you guy to see it on a big screen. Don't wait for the DVD! Since it was based on a true story, watching it on a big screen is more realistic, and imaginable. Trust me, $10 will definitely be worth to spend! I always have questions when I watch horror movies. I will post all the questions below. If you think you can answer my questions, please do it in a comment below. I will be very grateful. Also, some questions might sound a little dumb, so don't mind me.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert!) 1 Why did the Demon Nun want to kill Janet? 2 If she did want to kill her, why didn't she just kill her from the beginning instead of just trying to haunt the family? 3 Why was Janet the only one that could be possessed by the demon? 3 If Lorraine could use the bible to defeat the Demon by knowing her name, why was the Demon the one telling her name to her? (It's not like, ""Hey, this is my name, you can use it to kill me."" MEH -_-) 4 How did the Demon possess Bill? (I mean it makes sense if she possesses human, but possesses the same spirit? Like WTF?) 5 Also, wasn't the Demon in the United States at first? How dafuq did she possess Will in England? 6 Near the ending, why did the Demon wait until the couple's gone in order to start killing Janet?"

","First of all, I reall convey hearty wishes to James Wan the director for giving us such a wonderful film. I can see how much difficulties they will be faced during the casting of the film. <br/><br/>As well as , we should not forget about the art department for making such a beautiful house and the make up artist for the demon.<br/><br/>James wan did his job perfect on each and every moment of the movie. Over all i am so happy that he didn't forget to show how the warrens loves each other in the entire movie. Once agin hats off to James Wan and all the peoples involved in the Conjuring 2. Hopefully waiting for the Conjuring3."
"dslaura76","9","0","2","11 June 2016"," Finally signed up on IMDb because this movie was so good.
","The Conjuring 2 was the best horror movie I've seen in YEARS. The plot was good and scares were well-paced throughout the whole movie. The movie was long...over 2 hours...and I never got bored. Usually, when I got to the movies, I start to get restless after about 90 minutes, but not with The Conjuring.<br/><br/>There was no nudity, swearing or gratuitous gore. Not that I'm a prude - I don't mind that stuff - but I know that bothers some people. So if a family with teen-aged kids want to see a really good horror flick, you don't have to be worried about anyone being mortified over nude scenes and/or sex.<br/><br/>Also,it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the first ""Conjuring"" movie, so don't let that hold you back.<br/><br/>A bunch of people clapped after the movie. That always cracks me up...who are they clapping to? But I brought that up just to let you know that The Conjuring 2 seemed to be enjoyed by - at least - the majority of the audience. <br/><br/>Highly recommend. 9/10"

","This time believe all the hype! This is genuinely an amazing and scary movie! It's the first time I ever cried tears of joy in a horror film along with being so scared and on the edge of my seat in the last 15-20 minutes. James Wan is an amazing director! The drama, tension, atmosphere, character development, even down to the music is utter perfection! Chad Hayes along with the other writers wrote a script so perfect and was beautiful executed by amazing actors! Seriously if horror movies could win an academy award it would win in all categories. I am going to see this again and again and buy it when it comes on bluray! It is hard to make a movie as good as the first but they did and it's a lot scarier! *Slight spoiler.* My friend who saw it with me was dissatisfied with all the love and feel good aspects of the movie.

The theater was a full house and i all i could hear is screams the whole time, way better than the first part.

People who think this movie isn't great needs to get their eyes checked or they do not know what they are talking about. From the beginning the movie started to the end people were actually jumping from out of their seats.

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring 2"" (2016) for me was probably the best horror movie i've seen since, well... ""The Conjuring"". Try to skip all trailers and watch this movie in a movie theater - it's a truly one scary and superbly crafted ride. <br/><br/>James Wan is definitely a horror movie pro - he knows the genre very well and delivers everything you would expect from this kind of flick and more, much more. Just take the ending scene - you won't expect this kind of closing (no spoilers) scene after all the horror we witnessed during the whole 2 h 15 min. superbly paced ride - a scene which will definitely generate some applauding from audience (at least in my local theater it did). Or take the one were Patrick Wilson character ""interogates / talks"" with the possessed girl with everyone including him turned away from here - it is a long, one shoot - killer scene.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Conjuring 2"" was better then i expected it to be. I loved the first movie, witch wasn't perfect, but was a great horror movie. Before attending the screening i had doubts that they probably won't achieve the success of the first movie. I was wrong. It is as good as the original. It is superb sequel in all directions. ""The Conjuring"" franchise THIS quality is very welcomed."
"Rendanlovell","7","0","1","11 June 2016"," It overcomes its poor plot with new, effective scares.
","As I walked out of my showing of 'The Conjuring 2' I overheard a family talking amongst themselves. The youngest boy said that the film itself wasn't what scarred him but the noises did. This made me think a lot about what many people deem as horror. It's strange that, to many people, fear is not measured by how it makes them feel but by how far their butts left their seat. For me this is not effective horror. When I see a horror film I want to be affected by it. I want to feel that sense of dread that churns deep in your stomach and makes you sweat through your clothes. Unlike many people that saw this film with me, I thought this film did just that.<br/><br/>It's sad that people are writing off this films effectiveness based on the fact that there weren't many jump scares. I mean, there were obviously some in there but the majority of the film is atmosphere. The atmosphere that this film builds really gives off a sinister vibe. As I watched, an eerie feeling washed over me. The sense that this is not something we are suppose to be watching.<br/><br/>And this feeling continued for the films two hour run time. The more sinister the plot gets the more you just feel a sense of helplessness. This sense of dread helped the film be more than just any other horror movie. With this feeling surrounding the film the scares hit hard. It knows that jump scares are far better than false scares and it uses it's atmosphere to really make you lose it.<br/><br/>If anything jumps you in the film it is the ghost or something the ghost does. It's never like a bird flying around or a person grabbing someones shoulder. Instead the film actually uses the ghost to scare you. What I loved about this movie is how many new, different scares where in it. It's clear that James Wan was having a blast making this movie and he experimented with a lot of new things.<br/><br/>Some fall flat but most are extremely cool and effective. Not only was he experimenting with new scares but new camera movements as well. Which all turned out super impressive. There's a great birds eye view shot of people running down a alley that made my jaw drop. That's what separates this film from so many others. <br/><br/>The cast and crew seemed like they were having way to much fun with it. It gave the film energy that many don't have. This helped 'The Conjuring 2' elevate itself over a relatively bland story. A story that we have all seen a million times over. Where someone gets haunted, the family gets involved, than things get really bad so they call experts in to cleanse the house.<br/><br/>The fact that this isn't anything new or different really does hurt the film. It makes a lot of the scares predictable and the plot points less sharp. Not only that but when your movie runs for more than two hours with a story like this it can get a bit dry near the end. Especially when the previous hour and a half was a none stop scare fest.<br/><br/>It's at that point where I began to realize that not a single character had any personality what so ever. All anyone was, was a plot device for the script. A means of forwarding the story to the next scene. They would do something that a normal human probably wouldn't do, get freaked out and than it was on to the next scene.<br/><br/>While 'The Conjuring 2' may not be as good as the first film it is still a solid horror flick. It knows what it is and doesn't bother with the extraneous ""character building"" that many others do during the opening half hour. While it certainly would've made the film better to have characters we cared about, not pretending like they were doing this helped get to what we paid for. Getting the pants scared off of us. And this film does that in a fresh, new, and very effective way. If you're a horror fan this one should not be missed. Just make sure to manage your expectations."

","The sequel to the solid The Conjuring, James Wan's 'The Conjuring 2' is A Terrifying Sequel, that almost scores as much as its legendary predecessor in terms of scares & atmosphere. The Sequel is unsettling, spooky & absolutely engaging, turning out to be a much satisfying follow-up.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring 2' Synopsis: Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring 2' is a compelling horror ride, that arrests your attention & scares the daylights out of you. I found myself terrified at my seat, almost shutting my eyes & ears whenever a sound or visual offered something ghostly. I was particularly terrified in a superbly done sequence, involving a painting & a nun. Believe me, I'm never looking at a nun in the same manner! <br/><br/>Wan, Chad Hayes, Carey Hayes & David Leslie Johnson's Screenplay (supposedly based on a true-story) is hauntingly scary. 'The Conjuring 2' is almost at par with its predecessor, as the scares here, are truly well-done. The Writing superbly warms up in its first-hour & turns into a ride in the second-hour, only to culminate into a feast of a climax. Wan's Direction is brilliant. He creates an unsettling, eerie atmosphere, with his superior storytelling. Don Burgess's Cinematography captures the misty filled London, as well as all the scares & the human-drama, with flourish. Kirk M. Morri's Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are Fantastic. Joseph Bishara's is perfect. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga return as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren & they deliver remarkably. Its the strength of their performances that push 'The Conjuring 2' to further success. Frances O'Connor as the mother under torment, is fabulous. Madison Wolfe as the child under possession, is excellent. The kid blends sympathy with pure terror, without ever breaking out of character. Simon McBurney is first-rate. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Conjuring 2' is A Winner. Go, Get Spooked!"

","THE CONJURING 2 REVIEW - Yeah Finally watched it in theater and got a feel of watching a scary horror film in theater after a long time. Couldn't watch The Conjuring in theater but loved it when i watched it in Mobile so i was eagerly waiting to watch The Conjuring 2 in theater at any cost. Expectations were little bit higher and movie pretty much matched that level. Follow my Details - <br/><br/>Acting - Good but not upto the mark. Reason- Director didn't give much attention to this field as this is a horror flick not Cult Classic cinema. Still i feel Acting could have been better by all actors. <br/><br/>Writing - Very Good ! Story has been written very well, twists and realisticness deserves appreciation. <br/><br/>Screenplay - Fantastic ! Screenplay is very tight from the beginning till the end except starting 10 mins which takes time to set a plot, then movie takes pace and keep you hooked till the end. <br/><br/>Dialogues - Average ! Nothing impressive, ordinary dialogues and really can't expect much from a True Story. <br/><br/>Cinematography - CLASS ! Wow, great work by cameraman. Most scenes have been shot in Dark, Each and every angle looked scary and eye pleasing. <br/><br/>Direction - Good but not Great. It is a sequel so obviously everyone will compare it to its prequel and that's why i think Direction wasn't as great as previous one. But still a praise worthy work by a Director, its not easy to complete people's high expectations (Because its Prequel). Film looks tight from its beginning but loose Climax i mean The Conjuring had longer and more interesting climax than this. Here Director failed badly, he could have easily make Climax little bit more scary and interesting but i don't know why he didn't do it. <br/><br/>Final Words - Not better than The Conjuring and Despite having bit of loose climax this one is a Must Watch for all. Film will definitely leave you with an scary impact and jitters. Go for it, and enjoy another Breathtaking, Scary and Dangerous experience from Hollywood. 7/10 * Stars by Me."
"captainmike-michael","8","0","2","11 June 2016"," A Satisfying and more Emotional Engaging Horror Sequel
","Sequels of horror genre have always been cursed to turn out poor yet director James Wan manages to set his bar as compelling as the first one; though not critically-acclaimed but overall a satisfying scare without blood and gore. Slightly longer than its predecessor, the 134 minutes running time enhances smooth pacing of the plot, allows further debate over the controversy of supernatural phenomenons and scientific psychology, human tricks and role play of the religion organisations; even if parts of its horror elements may feel routine, it is still able to trigger chills and unsettling moods. Characters development and emotional engagement especially the love life of Warren have made this follow up more to like a family crisis drama interrupted by a demonic figure, thanks to the strong performance of the young casts, eerie but not over loud thematic scores as well as the confident cinematography and visual effects. Overall, the efforts of remaining the styles from the first one, the decision to twist the final act and the addition of dramatic aspects are mixing so well which eventually it just feels so real that leaves the desire to follow up with the next documented case."

The shots and the camera movement stood out for me and I loved it. The acting done by everyone is fantastic. They are all really talented, no doubt. The scares are awesome, some are predictable, some are not. So many new things and creativity in this movie. The soundtrack is creepy and kinda Insidious-y which I loved a lot. The twist in the end and the climax was so well -edited, it was pure satisfaction. Overall, a fantastic horror movie. I can't find any flaws in this film. James Wan didn't disappoint.

","I really enjoyed this one. The first description that came to mind after watching it (on opening day), was ""that was intense"". I felt the story wasn't as strong as the first Conjuring but the scare scenes were definitely more right in your face type of scenes.The relationship between Ed and Lorraine also continued to develop in this movie, which was pleasant to see. The daughter was played by the same actor, though she is obviously older. I just have to say that yes some areas are probably weaker with this movie from the first one but other areas are stronger and overall I'd say it's just as good as the first one. I will definitely be buying this movie when it comes out on video."

","The Conjuring 2 clearly demonstrates the directing capabilities of James Wan. Set to helm 2018's Aquaman, Wan chills the audience with fright, and warms them with romantic and comedic aspects. Considered one of the scariest films of all time, ""The Conjuring"" scared audiences half to death in 2013. Movie goers will return for the next fright of their life! With Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson reprising their roles, The Conjuring 2 bases it's true plot on Ed and Lorraine Warren working in London to help a mother raising her four children and battling demonic forces.<br/><br/>The acting, once again, is superb. Farmiga and Wilson have perfect chemistry, more specifically in the more sentimental and character driven moments of this film. The performances by the young child actors are surprisingly good, and are not annoying like most child acting. Frances O'Connor also gives a convincing performance in the film.<br/><br/>Written by Chad Hayes, Carey Hayes, James Wan and David Johnson, The Conjuring 2 is definitely well written, but suffers from being twenty minutes too long. Ultimately, the film is tense and thrilling, but you can definitely feel the two hours and fifteen minute running time. The film has sensible dialogue and interesting conversations between characters.<br/><br/>All in all, The Conjuring 2 is the best film I have seen so far this year. It truly is a masterpiece for the Horror genre. It is as enjoyable, if not, even more enjoyable than the first. It is well directed, superbly written and realistically acted. Everyone involved is to be commended."

","As a big movie fan I like all kind of good cinema and horror movies are one of them. (let's talk about the conjuring)I don't have to tell you how good was the first part of the conjuring that's why I was expecting more and exited about the the second outing of conjuring (the Enfield case) and after watching it I was satisfied with the treatment this movie got (from James Wan and writers)this movie is definitely more scarier then the first part it's a period horror movie and the feel of that is amazing because of great camera work and sets. Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren and Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren was as good as they were in first part but surprised by Madison Wolfe who played a character of Janet Hodgson rest of supporting cast did what is required to make this film more interesting.while watching horror movies I always expect better drama and if that drama is based on a period background it makes it more interesting where first part was more dramatic then horror(in a good way) second one is surely more scarier drama I hope you will enjoy this movie as I did."
"quincytheodore","8","0","2","11 June 2016"," The captivating magic of horror, intensely terrifying and equally inviting.
","With the new cooler scenery and entirely likable victims, The Warrens take on another haunting case in the retro England. This setting serves more than cosmetic, it differentiates itself from previous movie's warmer tone, while also providing a good vehicle to usher the horror. Along with the pristine visual, ""Conjuring 2"" brings back the veteran demonologists and introduces an oddly charming family, especially the little girl in peril.<br/><br/>James Wan already had a knack for showing eerie camera angles, this time he adds more movement and less cut to the mix. He knows how to attract or distract the audience's attention in a clever way, the more flowing camera offers more focus and in turns allowing the audience to follow these characters closely as they stumble and frantically run.<br/><br/>The family consists of a single mother and her children. From the first five minutes they will appeal to viewers, and it's a significant boon for a horror movie. Madison Wolfe as Janet, the little girl is impressive, she has a good on screen chemistry both with the family and the Warrens. The way she's putting a brave front even though she's exhausted from the abuse, but also creates a bit of skepticism is simply excellent.<br/><br/>Her siblings are easily identifiable and equally sympathetic. They have a casual tone, almost crude yet alarmingly funny as well. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine are visiting a known territory. They just fit in the picture, in rather creepy homecoming kind of way. There are residues from the familiar ambiance yet it's presented in more rainy gloomy tone.<br/><br/>""Conjuring 2"" is a pleasant gift for horror. It's frightening, yet it never fails to engage, drawing us to stay in the darkly atmosphere and cleverly crafted spectacle."

The young girl, Janet Hodgson (by Madison Wolfe) needs special mention - her's is yet another extraordinary performance.<br/><br/>Lorraine does not receive anything or is not able to sense any abnormal presence in the place they have been asked to investigate. Not until they find out the real real why she couldn't sense anything - everyone knows the magnitude of the problem ahead of them. Then comes the final showdown. I guarantee you it's gonna a thrilling ride from here on.<br/><br/>If you are thinking whether to watch this movie or not, spend not another moment thinking, just go right ahead and watch."
"steveneven","8","0","2","10 June 2016"," Lightning strikes twice with the ""Conjuring sequel"" (and quite literally too)
","Alright, alright. I will get straight to the point. ""The Conjuring 2"" is scary. So scary it is actually scarier than the first. So scary that if James Wan, the director of this movie, made me jump one more time, I would have fallen out of my seat.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring 2"" is also more interesting than the first ""Conjuring"". The Wan-directed sequel revolves around the Hodgson family, who believe their house is haunted. Because of this, they contact the Warrens, the same ghostbusters from ""The Conjuring"". Okay, not so original. However, when the Warrens investigate the Hodgsons' house, they suspect if the Hodgsons' house is really haunted. Are the Hodgsons making up this up? Are Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren not looking deep enough into the Hodgsons' case? The idea of ghostbusters being skeptical about paranormal activity is greatly ironic, and a nice change of pace from the first movie. In the first movie, Ed and Lorraine accepted that the Perrons' house was haunted; there was no doubt that the Perrons were telling the truth. In ""The Conjuring 2"", all bets are off.<br/><br/>What is also great about the ""Conjuring"" sequel is how likable its characters are. For one, Ed Warren is one of the most likable protagonists I have seen in a film. He wants the Hodgson family to stick together during their time of distress, and even bonds with them when he is not trying to conjure up nasty demons. He plays the Hodgsons guitar, he listens to music with them, and he even has a few heart-to-heart moments with the youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe). Lorraine Warren is also charming. She sticks up for her husband, she makes sacrifices for the Hodgson family, and she has a heart of gold. I really liked the Warrens, and I especially liked their relationship together.<br/><br/>What ""The Conjuring 2"" does masterfully, as one could have guessed, is making audiences wet their pants. Yes, there are conventional jump scares. Yes, they happen because the sound mixer cranked up the volume to 100. But, Wan is great at tricking his audiences as to where his scary ghouls are going to pop out of. He is also great at making you think something scary is going to happen when nothing does. Basically, if you do not get scared by this movie, you are fearless.<br/><br/>Yet, ""The Conjuring 2"" is not without its problems. For one, the movie is way too long. Wan wants to make his audience believe that he will end on a conventional, unsatisfying note that horror directors overuse. Then, he makes something more evil happen. Then, it turns out that ""evil"" thing was just a joke and the audience gets the ending they hoped for. While it was fun for Wan to trick his audience, it would have been more effective if he had one, solid ending. Moreover, the beginning is not scary enough. Wan uses tropes such as ""creepy-kids-are-scary"" and ""ooh-let's-re-create-an-old-horror-story-like-the-Amityville-murder"", and none of these conventions work. While they are entertaining, you almost doubt if the film will get scarier (which is does- BELIEVE me).<br/><br/>Criticisms aside, ""The Conjuring 2"" is a fantastic sequel. It is scary, it tells a great story, and it stars some truly likable people. Yes, it is overlong and the film could start off with a bang, but I am happy how ""The Conjuring 2"" turned out.. Oh, and the film looks great. Please do not see this movie on your 13 inch computer when it comes to iTunes. Treat yourself to the cineplex."
"subxerogravity","8","0","2","10 June 2016"," One of the most frightening supernatural horror films I've seen in the longest.
","I can't remember the last time one of these movies had me jumping out of the seat like I did for this.<br/><br/>James Wan proves that hes's a master at this when he's behind the director's seat. I've seen plenty of these movies where he produced them or whatever, but he needed to have his director's hat on for them to be this scary. The experience is so much better. <br/><br/>Everything was timed so perfectly. The Ghost were right behind the victims at the right time blended into the shadows to make you scared of what your looking at. A lot of camera tricks that make you think nothing is going on until you look long enough. The sounds echoed just at the perfect time to get your heart pumping. It was slow for just the right amount of time and you don't see the Ghost for just the right amount of time.<br/><br/>This film will having you clinging to your seat form the opening frame to the very end. The most suspenseful supernatural horror film I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>And frankly it's makes for an amazing sequel. You got to see this one!"
"gagga5","9","0","2","10 June 2016"," more gradual tension build up and unexpected scenes than conjuring I
","I will say from the very first beginning until the last 30% of the movie, you will be seeing typical James Wan style jump scares (only light ones) and classic scenes while getting involved in the story line. That being said, it gets your attention and traps you in to the story, but no major experience of terrors yet (for typical horror fans).<br/><br/>Once getting into the last 25minutes or so, I felt like walking into a haunted house in the amusement park as a kid (terrifying as moving each step forward). It was so exciting to enter, but once I am there, I don't want to move forward and am scared as hell that something will pop out in the dark, but there is no way back. That's how I felt.<br/><br/>I would also say the conjuring II is less predictable than the conjuring I. You can't quite guess how things will end in the conjuring II (happy ending or sad ending? I had no idea). But for the conjuring I, we kind of knew what was going to happen once the demon was fully possessing the women. Typical exorcist scenes from there. But for this sequel, there were many surprising elements.<br/><br/>I'm an extremely picky horror movie watcher, but I will have to say, go ahead and enjoy this movie (It's little over 2hrs but it goes quick). You won't be disappointed."
"j-w-b-concepts","10","0","2","10 June 2016"," Horror done right
","I do not understand why so many have trouble making a horror movie now a day. All you have to do is just use James Wan's creative genius as a guideline and you should, in Theory, have horror gold. Let me start off by stating that I thought the first conjuring was one of the scariest movies I have seen In a loooooong time, and put together so brilliantly, that when I heard James Wan was going to be putting out a sequel I knew we would be getting another horror masterpiece. The Conjuring 2 much like the first one has Ed and Lorraine Warren trying to help out a family who have encountered a demonic spirit. Although the concept of the story, similar to the first, it is all the little things and over all plot that made this sequel really stand out. The way James Wan builds up the story and does not kill you with cheesy jump scares, but instead pure suspense is something that a lot of writers and directors releasing horror films seem to miss. Wan builds a story taking events from the real Enfield haunting, stretching things at times for sure, but at the end puts together a movie that will leave you with chills. I am a horror fanatic, and I appreciate how cold the scenes feel at times, how bone chilling the darkness can be, and how simple sound effects can make ones skin crawl. Aside from the horror aspect there are scenes that get you attached to the Warrens all over again. This is not your typical horror film where the story is replaced with scares, and gore. We have a story, we have suspense, we have a connection with the characters, and even some comic relief in places. The only warning I have coming into this movie is that if you really want to sit there and enjoy it, wait for the crowds to die down. So many people come into these horror films the first week in groups it seems like, and laugh / talk after every scare. I myself will be seeing this a second time in a couple weeks once the hype dies down, that way I can really take everything in that this movie had to offer. Overall a must see as James Wan has done it once again. 10/10"
"dkemathas","8","0","2","10 June 2016"," The Einfield Case is a Killer!
","The 2013 film The Conjuring, directed by James Wan is a masterpiece to the horror genre, and became the highest grossing horror movie of all time. The film revolved the case about Batseeba Sherman, a woman who sacrificed her child to Satan and hung herself from the tree right in front of her farm in Rhode Island, New England, United States. In 1971 the Perron family experienced some disturbing events which was solved by The Warren couple.<br/><br/>The Conjuring 2, which is about the Einfield case, takes place six years later after the Rhode Island Case. First of all, the screenwriters and James Wan need to be praised, because it's not easy to make a sequel stand in the same level as the original. It rarely happens in Hollywood. A few examples in the horror genre could be Ridley Scott Alien (1979) and James Cameron's Aliens (1986), and John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981).<br/><br/>Every single actor should be praised for their performances, especially Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren, Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren, Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson and Frances O'Connor as Peggy Hodgson. I think why many horror movies don't succeed is because we don't feel pity or remorse for the characters in the story, but when it comes to this film it doesn't fail at all (which is proof that the script and the characters are believable and powerful). <br/><br/>Joseph Bishara's music is definitely a reason for why the movie is a killer. The background score just makes every single frame more and more intense and spooky and the cinematography by Don Burgess and editing by Kirk M. Morri was excellent.<br/><br/>To people who don't know anything about the Einfield case or the cases which were solved by the Warren couples: Don't expect another exorcism scene like the first one... you might get disappointed if you are a hardcore horror fan. The film has some scenes that will give us ''deja vu'' as it has been repeated over and over again.<br/><br/>Other than that, the story-line is really engaging and it will keep the audience to sit in the edge of their seats throughout the film."
"doug-64065","8","0","3","10 June 2016"," Conjuring double feature - opening night theater experience.
","Wanted to share the Conjuring's opening night theater experience...<br/><br/>Conjuring 1 at 5PM was good even with plot holes big enough for a casket. I screamed once and did the dead frog electrode thing a number of times. I understand it was the highest grossing horror movie ever at well over $300M. Hard to figure when it was just me and one other guy at the theater. Fool 'em once, can't fool 'em twice I guess. <br/><br/>They showed the double feature in one of their smaller theaters (#11). Conjuring 2 was to follow in #11 as well.<br/><br/>Had some ginger snaps and small drink for part 1 (brought Ginger Snaps with me). Left at intermission to get something more to eat. Came back and was working my way back to #11 but an usher blocked my path and said the manager wanted to see me. (All this over Ginger Snaps???)<br/><br/>Was told projector broke and part 2 was going to be in their ""Premium Theater"" where seats cost $19.95. Described it like an IMAX (they have one of those as well). Manager said to go back to #11 and pick up my stuff but I asked him if okay to get new. As they did not have Ginger Snaps, I settled for a small drink. Got to pick my seat off a selection screen. No charge for drink or upgrade to first class!<br/><br/>Conjuring 2 was excellent. No one or nothing dies (including the dog which cannot be said for the dark ""comedy"" Lobster). Well written, good dialog, lots of slower parts for recovery then a scare again. Even lots of LOL humor. And the scary parts were well crafted. My back and knees are sore this morning. These were launch popcorn roof high scares. The audience loved it and applauded afterwards even staying for most of the credits. Great evening, especially with the never had happen before, first class upgrade! About time though, I've certainly accumulated the miles (and hours).<br/><br/>Cheers to Good Movies Nights! Doug"
"jdesando","Null","0","2","10 June 2016"," It's a scary one, but no surprise because it has a nun doing the heavy lifting.
","""This is as close to hell as I ever want to get."" Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) <br/><br/>When a thriller-horror story is also a love story, I know I'm in the land of the Catholic Church, nuns, Christ, sin, and redemption. As for the love part of Conjuring 2, well, Lorraine and Ed Warren (Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) are famous paranormal investigators/demonologists (in real life, too) who happen to be married with a love that helps them through another demonic possession story.<br/><br/>After the real Amityville Horror and after The Conjuring, they are drawn again to similar shenanigans in North London. Now, even after the long break, they are back helping an Enfield family in demonic distress. The scene is not your usual rickety old Victorian mansion but rather a rickety old council flat. Together with director James Wan's expert tracking shots, this film knows just how to scare the hell out of the audience.<br/><br/>This case is about holding on to the one you loveâ€”the single-mom Peggy Hogson (Francis O'Connor) family hangs on to each other after dad has abandoned them while they are disturbed by the ghost of a ""crooked"" old man who wants them to leave his home. When all else fails the family, love brings them through, and in a sense so too does the old man's love of his family keep him in this world, even though he died years ago.<br/><br/>As for the Catholic/Christian overlay, the demon is dressed like a Goth nun, and a priest is consulted because the Church is renowned for its ability to exorcise (see The Exorcist from 43 years ago). As a former fallen-down Catholic boy, I can attest to the power of the nuns to direct our consciences, indeed our very inner spirits, away from sin, especially of the flesh. The downside is that we can fiercely fear the devil wearing a habit. In the end, God or his son on a little crucifix around Ed's neck will save the faithful.<br/><br/>You'd think in the Thatcher era, a demon in her outfit would be enough to scare a poor British family, but the Catholic Church works a better scare in habits because of its ambivalent role in many lives, savior and Satan"
"ffxpa","9","0","4","9 June 2016"," Awesome movie, but Insidious based
","James Wan, as always, did an amazing job with this movie, but I feel like it was a little ripped off of Insidious. I am aware James Wan also directed Insidious, but I was a little disappointed that he didn't make this movie original. What I mean by this, is the fact that Lorraine goes into what looks like ""the further"" from Insidious. I understand having a style of directing, but taking the entire concept of another movie and putting it in a different one definitely bothered me. There were other things that reminded me of Insidious as well, such as the peripheral view of an entity sitting in a chair.<br/><br/>I felt as though the Crooked man was random. I feel like he was only stuck in there so Ed had an item to put in his museum at the end of the movie, since Bill/The Nun wasn't ever connected to an item and was connected to Janet.<br/><br/>There were parts that didn't lead anywhere in this movie as well. When Peggy was bitten in the basement, nothing happened to her. They also found Bill's missing teeth, but that was never brought up again either.<br/><br/>These are the only negatives that I can find personally in this movie, but overall it was very well done. I have yet to give a negative review on something James Wan has done. I don't feel fair rating the scariness of it, because I am a person who is too into focusing on the plot to be scared of anything. So, coming from a thought-provoking standpoint, I enjoyed it very much."
"thumbworn","8","0","4","8 June 2016"," Not Perfect but Quite Entertaining
","I'll avoid dropping major spoilers and only specifically mention areas that I felt detracted from the film and that won't spoil anyone's experience by being mentioned.<br/><br/>It's rare anymore that I find a well-made, enjoyable horror movie. Flicks like Paranormal Activity, It Follows, and anything directed by Rob Zombie have somehow become the acceptable standard for horror. Yawn. I didn't watch any trailers or read anything about the plot of The Conjuring 2 and I didn't expect much from it. I received free pre-screening passes so I went to see it.<br/><br/>I found it to be quite entertaining and there is some creepy imagery. I won't elaborate so not to ruin anything for those not having seen it prior to reading this, but there are definitely some very interesting things visually and also a few that were quite unexpected. That's not to say there aren't moments of predictability and jump-scares, but for me the good far outweighed the bad, and there were even some humorous moments sprinkled throughout that worked quite well.<br/><br/>After only one viewing I certainly can't give an extremely detailed report, but the few negative things that bugged me while watching this are: Throughout the film, everyone seems to sleep like the dead, and loud noises, voices, crashes, etc., mostly don't wake anyone, even while sleeping in the same room as the disturbance. This trend begins at the start of the movie and is continued throughout...and it repeatedly pulled me out of the whole experience. The basement in the Hodgson residence is partially flooded and no one seems to find it strange or problematic. At one point it's raining and water is rushing in down some sort of trough. The whole basement area seems very unnatural. I'm not familiar with British housing, especially of the 70s, so I kept wondering if this was for plot-convenience and to make it more creepy, or if it is historically accurate and normal. There are a few other areas I found to be problematic, but I'm avoiding major spoilers and it's rare that films don't have a few flaws anyway.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it and I recommend checking it out. I'll be adding it to my horror collection once it arrives on blu-ray."
